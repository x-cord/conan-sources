1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,540
"I pledge to clean up Japan once and for all."

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,640
So, whose words are these?

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,940
Huh?

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,240
It sounds awfully familiar but I wonder who it was.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,140
Ryoma Sakamoto!

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,340
In the 3rd year of Bunkyu, 1863 June 29th,

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,140
it was written in the letter

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,340
that Ryoma sent to his older sister, Otome.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,740
Wow. You're so knowledgeable, Conan.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,940
I mean, I saw it on TV.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,040
But, why would you be quoting Ryoma's words, Sonoko?

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
The Ryoma Exhibition's being held

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,840
at Uncle Jirokichi's Suzuki Museum since last week.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,840
And, a forewarning of a crime letter was sent there...

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,340
by my beloved.

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,040
Sir Thief Kid, you see!

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,740
"You see?" You say in the Tosa dialect.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Right!

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,540
I was checking up on Ryoma and got all into it.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,540
But I don't think there's anything at the Ryoma Exhibition

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,040
that Kid would be interested in stealing.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,140
He does! The gunbelt that Ryoma is said to have been given

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,140
by Shinsaku Takasugi together with the pistol!

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,240
Gunbelt?

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,740
Right!

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,440
It's a gorgeous belt with a large ruby embedded by the buckle!

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Is it real?

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,540
There's also a letter that Ryoma wrote regarding the belt.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,240
It seems to have been authenticated by a famous appraiser too!

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,340
Well, I guess it's genuine

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,840
because Uncle Jirokichi got it after all!

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,640
No, it seems he couldn't get hold of it.

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,440
The person who wanted to feature that belt

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,040
and hold an exhibition

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,640
wouldn't agree to sell it to him for quite some time.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,140
So, Uncle having no other choice, told that person that

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,440
if he was going to hold a Ryoma Exhibition, do it here

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,340
and agreed to lend him the museum.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,240
But, like... Kid is after it too.

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Oh, well, it's actually not what it looks to be.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,040
Hey.

42
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,940
Like the fog clears.

43
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,040
Lets see through love and crime as well!

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
A forewarning of crime letter unlike the usual.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,740
Thief Kid fights for the treasure!

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,240
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:03:54,982 --> 00:04:00,782
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 1)"

50
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:05,082
What? He's coming to return something he stole?

51
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:08,782
You mean it was written in Kid's letter?

52
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,582
Yeah.

53
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:13,382
"There are three things I would like to return"

54
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:15,482
"to the Ryoma Exhibition that is currently being held."

55
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,882
"So, I shall appear in a few days."

56
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,982
"Thief Kid."

57
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:22,382
Three things?

58
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:26,182
It seems that this man, Mr. Shishihiko Tarumi

59
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,582
held a Ryoma Exhibition some 20 years ago too

60
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:32,582
and things were stolen back then.

61
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:35,682
On the night before Ryoma was assassinated,

62
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:39,182
an unfinished letter he wrote to his wife, Oryu.

63
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:42,582
An Omiya goblet with his blood that splattered on it

64
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,382
when he was assassinated.

65
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:48,482
And, the Smith & Wesson pistol's first model

66
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:51,782
that he had hidden in his pocket.

67
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:55,282
But those things were stolen not by Kid,

68
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,182
-if I remember correctly... -No.

69
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:01,682
The woman who was rumored to be the 20 faces of the Showa era,

70
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:04,982
the woman thief, Phantom Lady!

71
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:08,782
I don't know what kind of relationship Kid had with Lady

72
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,682
but after stealing the three items,

73
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,582
Lady quit committing crimes

74
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:16,182
and Kid appeared two years after that,

75
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,482
so they could've been teacher and student.

76
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:23,382
And? When is he coming?

77
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:27,382
I wonder. All it says in the letter is, in the near future.

78
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,882
Then, cancel the Ryoma Exhibition right away

79
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,482
and chase all the people out!

80
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,782
Without a definite date,

81
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:33,882
it's disadvantageous for us who are on guard,

82
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,482
and it may work out exactly as he planned!

83
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,482
If he's just going to come and return the goods,

84
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,782
he could easily do so by mingling among the crowd!

85
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:42,882
But, Mr. Nakamori.

86
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:45,682
I mean, he's coming all this way just to return the items.

87
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,082
Why should we object?

88
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:50,582
Oh, well, but Superintendent...

89
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:52,982
Besides, in order to nab Kid,

90
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:56,082
we'd first have to invite him in, wouldn't we?

91
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:59,882
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki who received the letter, was also saying,

92
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:02,882
"The entrance should be wide but the exit narrow."

93
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:05,882
He said that this is the fundamental of catching rats.

94
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:09,282
"The Great Suzuki Museum" -Uncle!

95
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,482
Long time no see!

96
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:13,682
Oh! I haven't seen you since the iron raccoon incident.

97
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,082
Hello.

98
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:18,482
There's quite a long line of people, isn't there?

99
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:19,682
Yeah.

100
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,182
Well, in addition to the popularity of Ryoma,

101
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,982
the letter was delivered from Kid too, so...

102
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,882
Well, if I were the host,

103
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:30,682
I would've advertised the event using leaflets, and TV commercials

104
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,882
and gather several times more than the people who are here!

105
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:38,882
But, isn't it unusual?

106
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,882
That you would lend your museum space out to someone

107
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:43,882
other than yourself.

108
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:46,282
I didn't think of doing so, at first,

109
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:49,682
but I just couldn't let an amateur take care of this situation

110
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,882
knowing that Kid would be coming to steal.

111
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:52,982
An amateur?

112
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:57,882
Yes, the one who is hosting this Ryoma Exhibition called Tarumi

113
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:01,282
held exhibitions every time something got popular,

114
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:04,982
be it the Gikyo Exhibition, or the Nobunaga Exhibition,

115
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,282
but because of sloppy security, he's been attacked by thief after thief

116
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:10,582
and something is stolen each time.

117
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:14,382
Then, you should've bought Ryoma's gunbelt!

118
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,282
Did he ask for an exorbitant amount or something?

119
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:20,382
No, on the contrary, I actually got a super discount.

120
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:24,282
He wouldn't let me show it to our appraiser before buying it

121
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,082
so I'm not even sure if it's genuine or not.

122
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:30,782
But, it's been appraised already by a famous appraiser, hasn't it?

123
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,282
Well, yes.

124
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:34,982
But, I've got my doubts

125
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:37,282
about whether we can really fish Kid with it.

126
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:40,682
But, you did get to fish Kid, didn't you?

127
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:45,282
Though it seems that he was not really after the gunbelt.

128
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,482
That gunbelt is genuinely

129
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:51,382
what was given to Ryoma by Shinsaku Takasugi!

130
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,182
Right? Master Hanamura.

131
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,982
"Masanosuke Hanamura (63), Appraiser" -Indeed.

132
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:57,982
Judging from the condition of the leather,

133
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:00,182
it is surely vintage.

134
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:03,182
The ruby on the buckle is splendid too.

135
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,282
Moreover, Ryoma himself

136
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:07,982
has drawn an explanatory diagram of that belt too.

137
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,682
It can be none other than genuine.

138
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,982
Masanosuke Hanamura.

139
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,082
He's got a good eye for sure,

140
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,082
but he charges an exorbitant amount for appraisal,

141
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:20,582
and rarely takes on any appraisal work.

142
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:23,482
If you would like to, do you want me to show you girls

143
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,182
the real thing with your very eyes?

144
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:29,282
Although it's still before opening time, I'll show it just to you.

145
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:35,882
Oh, so this is Ryoma's gunbelt!

146
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,282
This really has a kind of existence to it, doesn't it?

147
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:42,382
The picture of the belt is really drawn on the letter.

148
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:44,882
But I can't read the words.

149
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:49,182
-True. -In the past, men of America

150
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:53,182
used to carry this thing called a gunbelt on their hips.

151
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:56,282
It is the holder for a gun and the bullets to be put away.

152
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,482
In other words, it is like the sheath of a sword

153
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:00,582
wrapped around the hips by a belt.

154
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:05,082
It is a wonder that none of the current New Yorkers

155
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:10,382
are wearing such an interesting thing on them.

156
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,882
That's what it says.

157
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:13,882
I guess Ryoma would say something like that!

158
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,682
Yes, true!

159
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,882
Hey.

160
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,782
What's that big jar?

161
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,382
Oh, that's...

162
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:26,682
It's a jar that is said to be something

163
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:28,182
that Ryoma hid inside when he was a child

164
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:32,982
and got into trouble because he couldn't come out of it.

165
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:33,982
Other things include

166
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:36,982
the statue of the Buddha that Roma saw and complimented on

167
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:41,082
and the "kendama" that Ryoma is said to have wanted too.

168
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,882
In other words, anything goes...

169
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,982
Oh, could this hanging scroll be...

170
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,382
It's a hanging scroll that he impulsively wrote

171
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,982
when grieving over the corrupted government.

172
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:51,982
Just as I thought.

173
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:55,882
Well, but it's doubtful whether that's genuine too.

174
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,682
True.

175
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:01,082
If you will go as far to doubt the judgment of my eyes,

176
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:03,382
after the Ryoma Exhibition is over,

177
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:06,282
I'll agree to show it to your appraiser for appraisal then.

178
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:08,482
Oh! I couldn't ask for better!

179
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:13,282
That is of course, if the things here are spared

180
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:16,282
from the evil hands of the Magician under the Moonlight.

181
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,782
I shall leave the security within the museum to you, then,

182
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,782
Advisor Suzuki.

183
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:22,882
Yeah.

184
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:27,182
They're sure suspicious characters.

185
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:30,082
Say... Maybe he's got all the things exhibited here

186
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:32,982
covered by a high amount of insurance?

187
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,682
I thought so too, and checked,

188
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:39,682
but only a measly amount was insured.

189
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,382
The admission fee is cheap too,

190
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:45,082
so if anything is stolen, it would be a great loss.

191
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,882
Then, uncle, just what do you intend to do?

192
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:52,482
Well, you've got some kind of strategy worked out, don't you?

193
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,882
Well, the thing is...

194
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,382
No?

195
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:00,582
You prepared virtually nothing?

196
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:03,082
-No. -"No," huh?

197
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,082
If he were going to come here to steal something,

198
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,982
I have to prevent him from doing so.

199
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,482
But there is nothing I can do

200
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,482
if he wants to come to return something.

201
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:15,882
All three items are small enough to hide into his pocket.

202
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:19,982
Besides, I had my hands full just trying to make the space for them.

203
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,182
"Spaced Reserved for Thief Kid's Returned Treasures"

204
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:23,682
You mean the assumed location

205
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,282
for where Thief Kid will be returning the treasure.

206
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:29,582
If only I knew when and what time he's planning to show up,

207
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:31,782
there is something I could do, but...

208
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,482
Huh? You mean there was nothing about

209
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,182
when he would be coming in the letter?

210
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:37,282
Right, there was nothing!

211
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:41,282
There hasn't been one time till now when Kid implied

212
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:44,382
or made no mention of the time and date he would be showing up.

213
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,582
Inspector Nakamori...

214
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,582
Don't tell me it's someone else then, trying to copy Kid,

215
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:50,982
and putting the blame on him?

216
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:55,482
No, that letter is definitely what he had sent.

217
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,482
Maybe he's planning to mail another letter when he has the chance,

218
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,882
indicating the time and date he'll be showing up?

219
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:03,282
Like, his schedule is too busy now

220
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:05,882
so he's waiting for a convenient date or something.

221
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:08,082
If so,

222
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:11,082
what could he be waiting for?

223
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,782
It sure is popular, just as expected.

224
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:36,182
Yes.

225
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:39,182
But the most popular is...

226
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,982
the place that Kid is assumed to return the treasure.

227
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,182
I'm sure that Ryoma is vexed to tears.

228
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:49,982
Hey, stop pushing!

229
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,182
Hold it!

230
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:05,982
I see.

231
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:08,682
A sensor is set up to that space only

232
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:12,882
and plain clothes officers are mingled among the crowd.

233
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:14,682
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,082
I was just playing.

235
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,282
And if a suspicious person should appear,

236
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,182
it's rigged so that the person can be nabbed on the spot.

237
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,482
Advisor!

238
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:28,782
What's with all the noise?

239
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:31,882
Just now, this was found in the mailbox of your residence!

240
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,082
This is...

241
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,782
A letter from Kid?

242
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:39,882
What?

243
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:45,682
Tomorrow at 20:00 just before closing time.

244
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:48,182
I will bring the pistol in question

245
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:51,682
and would like to cleanse my comrades of the government

246
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:55,182
in the name of Ryoma Sakamoto.

247
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,882
Thief Kid.

248
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:05,182
Kid!

249
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,382
Just what does this mean?

250
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,982
Cleanse.

251
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,182
Water...

252
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,382
Don't tell me!

253
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,782
Rain.

254
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,182
Was this what Kid was waiting for?

255
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:40,282
I pledge to clean up once and for all.

256
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:41,482
Right now!

257
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,187
Take a look at this super long line!

258
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:54,787
Hearing that Thief Kid informed that

259
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,687
he will be committing the crime at 20:00 tomorrow,

260
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,587
despite it being right before closing time,

261
00:14:58,587 --> 00:14:59,987
Thief Kid's fans are gathering one after the other over

262
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:03,687
to the Great Suzuki Museum forming a crowd!

263
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:06,287
Will Thief Kid appear as predicted

264
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,887
and be able to return the items that were stolen 20 years ago,

265
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,387
that is, Ryoma Sakamoto's letter, the goblet

266
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,587
and the pistol?

267
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,387
Or, is he planning to steal the gunbelt

268
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:18,187
in return for the things he will be returning?

269
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,487
And, what is his true intention behind suddenly publically

270
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,887
announcing the day he will be committing the crime?

271
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,887
Will everything be made clear tomorrow?

272
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:30,387
What? Rain?

273
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,187
You mean Kid waited for it to rain

274
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:34,687
before he decided on the day of his crime to be carried out?

275
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:38,187
Yes! It looks like it's going to start raining anytime outside now,

276
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,887
and tomorrow's weather forecast says it'll rain!

277
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,587
But, how on earth does he intend to use the rain to his advantage?

278
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,387
Is he planning to bust through the ceiling

279
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:49,487
where the Ryoma Exhibition is being held?

280
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:54,087
No, my staff checked the museum right before opening,

281
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:57,387
but there are no explosives set up at all!

282
00:15:57,387 --> 00:16:01,187
Maybe it's the clothes the people are wearing?

283
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,687
Because when it rains,

284
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:05,787
there are a lot of people wearing raincoats.

285
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:07,087
I see!

286
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:10,887
If he's mingled among that crowd, he would be inconspicuous!

287
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,987
Right, right!

288
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,087
It's hard to believe that Kid would've been waiting for rain

289
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,787
because of such a dinky reason but...

290
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:20,587
At any rate, I think we should cancel the exhibition tomorrow

291
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:23,687
and keep people from coming here!

292
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,987
Then, he would end up coming to this exhibition hall

293
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,487
where only we are on guard,

294
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:33,187
all alone in order to return three items in question.

295
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:38,987
It'll turn into an ideal situation to nab him!

296
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:42,087
But, up to now he has always under similar situations,

297
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,087
disguised himself as you or one of your men,

298
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,187
and while putting everyone to sleep using sleeping gas.

299
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:51,687
Not this time! We will all be wearing gas masks

300
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:54,187
as well as verify everything using passwords.

301
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,387
If we make sure to strictly follow set procedures, all will be fine!

302
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:58,487
So long as there aren't any people getting in our way,

303
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,887
we can definitely nab him.

304
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,987
I can't really agree to your plan, though.

305
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,887
I gathered items having to do with Ryoma Sakamoto

306
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:09,887
and am holding this exhibition

307
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,787
because I want to introduce them to as many people as possible.

308
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:15,087
And yet to say, the exhibition should be held off

309
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,687
for an entire day just for one thief,

310
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:20,387
I really can't agree that's a very good idea.

311
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:23,087
Oh, but, you see...

312
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:26,887
Moreover, during the instant teleportation incident,

313
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,587
just because the people were kept from coming inside,

314
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:32,687
it seems that Kid called off the crime to be committed.

315
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:35,987
He's coming all this way to return the three items

316
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:39,087
that were stolen from me 20 years ago, you know?

317
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:42,387
I really don't want him to call it off.

318
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:47,587
At any rate, please let the people in as usual tomorrow!

319
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:49,987
Whether you can catch Kid or not

320
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,187
depends on your skill and capability!

321
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:56,887
Besides, I wish you'd guard and protect what you should be protecting.

322
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,087
After Kid returns the three items,

323
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,387
I've heard rumors that he will be coming after

324
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:04,787
the featured item of the Ryoma Exhibition,

325
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:09,787
the gunbelt that Ryoma owned, as his reward.

326
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:11,887
Well, I trust you will do your job.

327
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:15,287
Police officers!

328
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,487
Darn!

329
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:19,487
If they trust us, why don't they cooperate?

330
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,587
But, we've got a problem.

331
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:23,087
With so many people here,

332
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:26,387
he'd be able to return the three items fairly easily.

333
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:29,887
There's one way that he wouldn't be able to do that!

334
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:34,187
Remember? It was also written in his letter that just got here!

335
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:38,187
Tomorrow at 20:00 just before closing time.

336
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:40,787
I will bring the pistol in question

337
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,187
and would like to cleanse my comrades of the government

338
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:47,887
in the name of Ryoma Sakamoto once again.

339
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,287
What about this?

340
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:52,887
Well, Kid's going to come not to steal something like usual

341
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,587
but rather to return things, you know?

342
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:56,987
Moreover, one of the items is a pistol.

343
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:58,887
If you use a metal detector gate like the one

344
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,387
they use at airports and check, it'll be easy to find him!

345
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:05,787
Because the one holding the pistol is Kid!

346
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,187
True.

347
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:12,387
You're so smart, Conan.

348
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,587
We the police thought about that too,

349
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:20,387
but were told from the higher ups not to!

350
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:21,487
Why?

351
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:22,987
If we were to protect something,

352
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,887
we would set things up at the entrance,

353
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,087
but if he sees something set up before coming into the museum,

354
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,687
we figured he'd think twice about returning the items!

355
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,587
Then, why not set it up not at the entrance,

356
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:38,487
just before this room with the Ryoma Exhibition?

357
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:41,487
And a lot too, so the people won't stop in place!

358
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:42,887
Oh, come on.

359
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:45,387
That's a great idea!

360
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:48,187
While we're at it, we could set up an X-Ray device

361
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,987
that can scan the insides of hand carry bags, then, it'll be perfect!!

362
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:54,387
Hey, Kid's coming tomorrow, you know?

363
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:57,587
We could never get those things ready by then.

364
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:01,087
Oh, with the power of the Suzuki Financial Group,

365
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,487
that poses no problem!

366
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:05,687
We could nab him at the gate!

367
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:10,187
If anyone is to see the gate and back off in fear,

368
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:12,687
that would be the Kid!

369
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:16,187
Okay! Start setting up the gates right away!

370
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:19,787
Turn the museum into a large cage trap in half a day

371
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,887
to catch the Kid!

372
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,087
Yes, sir!

373
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:28,787
Just as expected, rich people sure are flashy.

374
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,387
Okay, you guys!

375
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:31,987
There is a high possibility that

376
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:34,787
Kid has come in here beforehand with a pistol!

377
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,187
Check every nook and cranny of the museum

378
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:40,087
-using the metal detector! -Yes, sir!

379
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:50,687
"The Next Day"

380
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,287
Officers on guard at the entrance of the museum!

381
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,487
How is it going there?

382
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,487
Sir!

383
00:20:56,487 --> 00:21:00,587
There's no one who noticed the gate and rushed to leave!

384
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:03,387
Is the metal detection gate functioning all right?

385
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,187
Yes! There is no one in possession of the pistol in question.

386
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:08,887
What about inside the exhibition room?

387
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:13,387
No one who looks to be Kid has appeared yet.

388
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:15,187
Is Kid really going to come?

389
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:16,687
Idiot!

390
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,687
There isn't a time that Kid had warned of a crime

391
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,087
and not shown up!

392
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:21,687
I'm sorry!

393
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,687
Come on, Kid.

394
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:29,387
I'll catch you for sure this time!

395
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:32,887
Wow, fantastic!

396
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:36,387
It really looks like the boarding gate of an airport!

397
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:38,787
Moreover, there are three gates in all.

398
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:41,787
Just as expected of Uncle. He's really something!

399
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,787
Something bothers me after all.

400
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,487
Writing something like,

401
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,387
"I'll be bringing the pistol with me" deliberately,

402
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:57,387
I'm sure he would assume something like this would happen, and yet...

403
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:59,287
In addition, I can't even make out

404
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:03,087
how he plans to use the rain to his advantage yet, either.

405
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:05,087
The last sentence of the letter.

406
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:07,287
"I pledge to clean up once and for all."

407
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,487
I don't understand what it means.

408
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:14,187
Did he just happen to use Ryoma's phrase to play on words?

409
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:19,187
Or is he really planning to wash something?

410
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,387
Darn!

411
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:27,387
What on earth is Thief Kid going to be washing?

412
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:54,687
17cm is about...

413
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:56,487
This long?

414
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:57,487
Kid!

415
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:01,287
I came to return the stolen goods this time.

416
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:03,887
Come on, let's go inside too!

417
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,587
I don't think you should!

418
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:10,387
Because it's for sure that Thief Kid's going to do the washing here!

419
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:14,087
Thief... Thief Kid!

420
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,387
Next Conan,

421
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:19,787
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 2)"

422
00:24:20,514 --> 00:24:22,814
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:22,814 --> 00:24:24,914
"Water Color Paint"

424
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,614
I'm returning stolen treasure this time

425
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:27,814
so stay out of my way.

426
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,718
I wonder about that.
