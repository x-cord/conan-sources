1
00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:04.282
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.482
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.182
Today's stage is at a party.

4
00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:09.782
The big shots better beware!

5
00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:11.482
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:13.382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.682
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:59.795
"Mysterious Assassin (Part 1)"

9
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.195
"Reception Desk"

10
00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:08.795
I never thought it would be like this.

11
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.295
What a headache.

12
00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:13.795
Here you go, Conan.

13
00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.595
Thank you.

14
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.595
There were a lot of people in line,

15
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.695
but see, he let me cut in front of him.

16
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:23.095
The man over there who are talking to the sumo player.

17
00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:25.195
He's the president of a dye house, isn't he?

18
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.195
You know him, Conan?

19
00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:30.095
No, but look at his fingers.

20
00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:31.195
Fingers?

21
00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:35.295
The color of the dye rubs off not only on the fingers,

22
00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:38.795
but also inside the nails if you dye things everyday.

23
00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:42.695
But the same thing happens to regular workers.

24
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.695
How did you know he was the president?

25
00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:48.295
Compare his right hand and left hand.

26
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.995
His right hand is tanned,

27
00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:52.095
but his left hand is not, right?

28
00:02:52.095 --> 00:02:55.695
Which means he plays golf.

29
00:02:55.695 --> 00:03:00.295
He wouldn't be that tanned unless he plays golf often.

30
00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:03.295
An employee wouldn't be able to play too much golf,

31
00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:04.995
so of course, he is the president.

32
00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:06.295
That's right!

33
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.495
Excuse me.

34
00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:11.395
Please give me your autograph, too!

35
00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:15.495
I'm a great fan of Kazekabuto.

36
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.795
I'm Kazeiwato!

37
00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:22.095
I'm very sorry.

38
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:29.195
I was shocked.

39
00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:33.095
I can't tell sumo and wrestlers apart without their loincloth.

40
00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:35.695
I guess I'll just have to forget about getting his autograph!

41
00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:41.695
Hey, Dad!

42
00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:44.995
It's embarrassing, so stop eating like that.

43
00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:46.795
They're the ones who pushed the party ticket on me

44
00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:48.195
in place of paying detective fees!

45
00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.595
I don't want to lose out!

46
00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:53.595
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

47
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:54.795
Yes.

48
00:03:56.095 --> 00:03:59.395
"Yukiko Tanaka (25)" -I am Yukiko Tanaka.

49
00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.695
Could you spare me a bit of your time?

50
00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:05.295
Sure, sure! By all means!

51
00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.695
We can also get married while we're at it.

52
00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:10.395
Please come this way.

53
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.795
Yes, yes! Anywhere you want me to go, I'll go.

54
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:14.395
Gosh.

55
00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:18.695
So you're the president of a company?

56
00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:19.695
"Seiji Ishimoto (54)" -Yes.

57
00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:22.695
Our company manufactures precision parts

58
00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.895
for aircrafts and computers.

59
00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:28.095
And what can I do for you?

60
00:04:28.095 --> 00:04:29.295
Ms. Tanaka.

61
00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:30.395
Yes.

62
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.995
Actually, the president was blackmailed.

63
00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:34.595
Blackmailed?

64
00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:39.995
"You're not worth being alive.

65
00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:42.595
I'll kill you off for sure!"

66
00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:45.995
Mr. Mouri, we would like you to find the culprit.

67
00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:49.195
Then, Conan, can you tell me about that person over there?

68
00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:51.295
The one to the left.

69
00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:52.595
The person who handed over his name card

70
00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:54.195
seems to be an executive,

71
00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:56.095
and yet he is acting obsequious,

72
00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.495
so that man must be some super big shot.

73
00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:09.695
I'm guessing him to be from some financially distinguished family.

74
00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:12.195
I don't thinks so.

75
00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:13.295
"Tsuneaki Niikura(32)" -He's probably...

76
00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:16.095
the secretary of some big shot politician.

77
00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:18.995
I wonder?

78
00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.095
See that person over there...

79
00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:22.195
Huh?

80
00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:24.195
He seems to be out of place.

81
00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:27.995
He's been watching everyone for some time now.

82
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.395
He doesn't seem to be enjoying the party at all.

83
00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.995
What do you think his profession is?

84
00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:36.995
Do you have any idea why such a letter was sent here?

85
00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:38.195
No.

86
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:41.495
Why don't you report it to the police?

87
00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:44.195
The president doesn't like the police.

88
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:47.395
Besides, the police won't get serious over the matter

89
00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:50.595
unless something actually happens, right?

90
00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:53.895
Well, it's true to some extent.

91
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:57.495
But you sure seem to know a lot about the police.

92
00:05:57.495 --> 00:05:59.695
I not only know a lot about the police,

93
00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:02.295
I know a lot about you too, Mr. Mouri.

94
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.095
After all, I'm the one who decided to call you.

95
00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:06.595
You did?

96
00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:08.195
I searched you on the computer

97
00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:10.695
and thought you to be just the right person.

98
00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:13.295
I see.

99
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:15.295
You'll accept this case, won't you?

100
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:16.695
All right!

101
00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:17.895
But please be prepared

102
00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:21.395
for me to hang around Mr. Ishimoto day in and day out from now on.

103
00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:22.495
Yes.

104
00:06:22.495 --> 00:06:25.495
I'll leave the method of investigation totally up to you.

105
00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:30.195
And I'll be able to hang around with Yukiko, too.

106
00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:31.795
Hi, kid!

107
00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:34.995
How about taking a picture for good memories?

108
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.195
Ran, let's have her take our picture!

109
00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:39.095
Come, hurry!

110
00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:40.795
This way is better!

111
00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:43.695
Okay, here goes.

112
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.295
Now, let's say...

113
00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:46.395
-Cheese! -Cheese!

114
00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:54.695
At any rate, I have done nothing to be hated by anyone.

115
00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.995
But having lived this long,

116
00:06:57.995 --> 00:07:02.195
I may have hurt someone unwittingly.

117
00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:05.595
However, that is not my fault!

118
00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:06.995
Right...

119
00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:13.395
And now, we would like invite one of the guests to share a few words.

120
00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:16.795
Mr. Masao Takada, a member of Japan House of Representatives.

121
00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:18.995
Please come up to the stage.

122
00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:26.595
Mr. Minister, this way please.

123
00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:30.995
See! He was secretary to politician, right?

124
00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:33.195
You're right. Conan, you're something!

125
00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:35.495
Well, hello. Thank you.

126
00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:39.295
Isn't it amazing that the light shines directly on the speaker

127
00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:41.395
despite the whole place being dark.

128
00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:43.895
The place he stands is either previously set up

129
00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:46.195
or it's automatically set up that the spotlight shines

130
00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:48.895
on the microphone he has on him.

131
00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:54.195
Why doesn't he go straight to the stage?

132
00:07:54.195 --> 00:07:58.395
Maybe he wants to get everyone's attention?

133
00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:02.795
He's gone.

134
00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:06.295
Hi, Mr. Ishimoto. Please excuse us.

135
00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:08.095
I'm sorry, but please excuse me.

136
00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:12.295
What the...

137
00:08:13.295 --> 00:08:14.495
President?

138
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.195
Mr. Niikura...

139
00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:19.495
Huh?

140
00:08:36.595 --> 00:08:38.995
Mr. Takada...

141
00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:44.695
Conan!

142
00:08:52.795 --> 00:08:55.995
Darn it! He sure knows how to run for it.

143
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:06.595
A terrible thing has happened to Mr. Takada.

144
00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:09.295
Yes. So, please contact all his supporters.

145
00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:14.395
Hello, this is Niikura.

146
00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:17.495
You say that someone is after Mr. Ishimoto's life

147
00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:19.995
and blackmailed him?

148
00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:22.895
Yes, and that's why I was hired.

149
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:23.995
In other words,

150
00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:26.595
the bullet that was aimed at Mr. Ishimoto went off its mark

151
00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:29.695
and hit Mr. Takada instead.

152
00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:31.795
Yes, that's right.

153
00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:34.295
Since there were a lot of people here,

154
00:09:34.295 --> 00:09:36.895
there may be some witnesses.

155
00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:37.895
Officer Takagi! -Yes!

156
00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:39.695
Where are the people who were here?

157
00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:42.895
Well, they are all gathered in the room next door.

158
00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:48.595
Conan, I don't want you go here and there on your own!

159
00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:51.495
I got nervous, so I went to the restroom.

160
00:09:51.495 --> 00:09:53.295
Oh, Pops!

161
00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:56.495
Don't you dare say anything if it's about the murder!

162
00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:59.795
But I saw a suspicious looking man.

163
00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:03.995
-What? -First, he was over there by the wall,

164
00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:05.495
but when the pistol went off,

165
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.295
he was in the light fixture box.

166
00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:09.995
Is that so...

167
00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:11.595
If from there,

168
00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:15.395
it's possible to shoot despite all the people in the room

169
00:10:15.395 --> 00:10:18.095
What kind of man was he?

170
00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:20.695
This man.

171
00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:22.895
He sure does look like a criminal.

172
00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:25.095
What're you doing, Mr. Mouri?

173
00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:26.095
Let's go.

174
00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:27.395
Inspector!

175
00:10:27.395 --> 00:10:30.095
There's a picture of a man who may be the culprit.

176
00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:31.795
What? Are you serious?

177
00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.695
Yes! I'm sure that it's him.

178
00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:45.695
Conan, don't touch it.

179
00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:48.395
Officer Takagi, what is this?

180
00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:51.995
It's the debris of the compact microphone

181
00:10:51.995 --> 00:10:53.495
that Mr. Takada was wearing on his chest.

182
00:10:53.495 --> 00:10:55.895
The bullet hit him there?

183
00:10:55.895 --> 00:10:58.095
Well, I guess so.

184
00:10:59.595 --> 00:11:02.395
That's enough for now, isn't it, Conan?

185
00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.895
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

186
00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:06.395
I just happened to take my eyes off of him for a minute.

187
00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:08.895
Conan, let's go wait in the lobby.

188
00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:21.095
Conan, just where do you think you're going?

189
00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:24.295
I've got to go to the restroom again. I may leak!

190
00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:28.295
What restroom?

191
00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.695
-That was fun, right? -Right!

192
00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:45.795
She looks quite desperate.

193
00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:48.995
Who is that long haired guy?

194
00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:10.295
He's gone.

195
00:12:11.895 --> 00:12:14.495
The president's life was in danger

196
00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:17.795
and yet she is meeting with a man in secret.

197
00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:20.095
There must be something behind all this.

198
00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:38.184
Mr. Mouri, I've already been questioned,

199
00:12:38.184 --> 00:12:40.384
so I guess I'll be going.

200
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.084
Mr. Ishimoto.

201
00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:44.184
Maybe your wound isn't serious,

202
00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:46.784
but somebody is after your life.

203
00:12:46.784 --> 00:12:48.884
We'd like you to go to the police hospital just to be safe.

204
00:12:48.884 --> 00:12:51.384
-Not to the police. -Huh?

205
00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:53.784
There is an hospital that he always goes to.

206
00:12:53.784 --> 00:12:56.884
Besides, whether one wants to be protected by the police or not,

207
00:12:56.884 --> 00:12:58.684
it should be the choice of the individual.

208
00:12:58.684 --> 00:13:01.184
Well, that's true.

209
00:13:01.184 --> 00:13:04.584
But then, who is going to protect Mr. Ishimoto?

210
00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:06.784
You, Mr. Mouri.

211
00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:08.584
We're counting on you.

212
00:13:08.584 --> 00:13:11.084
I see, all right!

213
00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:13.384
I'll stay over here with you from tonight.

214
00:13:13.384 --> 00:13:15.884
All right, let's go to the hospital, president.

215
00:13:18.784 --> 00:13:19.984
Oh, Mr. Mouri.

216
00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:22.284
-Yes. -About the man in the picture...

217
00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:23.484
How was it?

218
00:13:23.484 --> 00:13:25.984
I checked the list of participants,

219
00:13:25.984 --> 00:13:28.584
but he wasn't on the list.

220
00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:31.684
But we've laid a strict police ambush around the area.

221
00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:33.284
Maybe we'll come up with something.

222
00:13:33.284 --> 00:13:35.684
We are also checking if he has any previous record.

223
00:13:35.684 --> 00:13:38.284
Mr. Mouri, what are you doing?

224
00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.484
Please don't leave me alone!

225
00:13:40.484 --> 00:13:43.084
Yes, yes, I'll be right with you.

226
00:13:43.084 --> 00:13:46.284
Do you know which police hospital to take him to?

227
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.084
He says he doesn't like the police.

228
00:13:49.084 --> 00:13:51.584
I'm going to sleep over there with Yukiko from tonight onwards

229
00:13:51.584 --> 00:13:52.984
and be his bodyguard.

230
00:13:52.984 --> 00:13:54.884
Hey!

231
00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:57.484
I won't be held responsible for whatever may happen.

232
00:13:57.484 --> 00:14:00.084
Please come this way.

233
00:14:00.084 --> 00:14:02.784
What a fine car you have.

234
00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:07.884
Yukiko, please come here.

235
00:14:07.884 --> 00:14:11.884
Wouldn't it be safer to sit surrounding the the president?

236
00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:14.884
That's true.

237
00:14:14.884 --> 00:14:16.784
Come, you be nice and come home with me, okay?

238
00:14:16.784 --> 00:14:17.984
Okay.

239
00:14:23.884 --> 00:14:27.284
The subway station is that way.

240
00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:30.084
Conan!

241
00:14:36.284 --> 00:14:39.284
With that many people present at this hall,

242
00:14:39.284 --> 00:14:41.984
it would be extremely difficult to shoot Mr. Ishimoto.

243
00:14:43.084 --> 00:14:45.684
It would be impossible without the help of a professional marksman.

244
00:14:58.884 --> 00:15:00.484
What's this?

245
00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:03.184
There is a scratch and the remains of glue on the spotlight.

246
00:15:03.184 --> 00:15:05.884
Why would something like this be here?

247
00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:07.184
Wait a second.

248
00:15:08.984 --> 00:15:10.584
The debris of a microphone...

249
00:15:11.584 --> 00:15:13.584
The control room for the lights is...

250
00:15:21.384 --> 00:15:23.984
This is something!

251
00:15:23.984 --> 00:15:28.584
It's more like a hotel suite than a hospital.

252
00:15:28.584 --> 00:15:32.884
The room that you'll be sleeping in is the room we just passed by.

253
00:15:32.884 --> 00:15:36.584
In other words, there is only one entrance and exit.

254
00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:38.684
If anyone were to sneak into this room,

255
00:15:38.684 --> 00:15:41.584
they would have to go through your room first.

256
00:15:41.584 --> 00:15:43.084
I see.

257
00:15:43.084 --> 00:15:45.384
You're as careful as I thought you'd be.

258
00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:48.184
You've got his safety well planned out.

259
00:15:48.184 --> 00:15:50.084
Most naturally.

260
00:15:50.084 --> 00:15:52.984
This company is run by the president himself,

261
00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:56.384
so if anything ever happens to him, it'll close down.

262
00:15:56.384 --> 00:16:00.684
By the way, where are you going to be staying over, Yukiko?

263
00:16:00.684 --> 00:16:02.884
There's only one bed here.

264
00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:04.784
I'm going home

265
00:16:04.784 --> 00:16:07.784
because you're going to guard him, aren't you, Mr. Mouri?

266
00:16:07.784 --> 00:16:09.984
Is that so?

267
00:16:12.084 --> 00:16:14.384
How about it, Mr. Mouri?

268
00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:15.884
Nice room, isn't it?

269
00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:17.984
I'm counting on you!

270
00:16:17.984 --> 00:16:20.184
Yes, I'll do my best.

271
00:16:20.184 --> 00:16:23.584
President, don't you have to be treated for your wound?

272
00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:25.284
That measly bullet.

273
00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:27.184
This is only a scratch!

274
00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:30.784
Ms. Tanaka, I'll leave Mr. Takada in your hands.

275
00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:33.884
Yes, I'll make sure everything is taken care of.

276
00:16:35.984 --> 00:16:38.484
Mr. Takada?

277
00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:41.184
The funeral fees and compensation.

278
00:16:41.184 --> 00:16:46.084
After all, Mr. Takada got shot in place of the president.

279
00:16:46.084 --> 00:16:48.884
I was going to pay a visit to his house now.

280
00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:51.684
Are you leaving already?

281
00:16:51.684 --> 00:16:55.784
My appointment with Mr. Niikura is a bit later,

282
00:16:55.784 --> 00:16:57.784
so I'll keep you company for a while.

283
00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:59.784
Really?

284
00:16:59.784 --> 00:17:01.984
All right!

285
00:17:01.984 --> 00:17:04.084
Would you like something to drink?

286
00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:06.184
Some beer, please.

287
00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:09.584
I mean a cola.

288
00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:11.084
Oh, right.

289
00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:13.384
May I ask you a question?

290
00:17:13.384 --> 00:17:15.184
Yes, what is it?

291
00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:18.984
You mentioned that you chose me using the computer,

292
00:17:18.984 --> 00:17:22.784
but there are a million of other private detectives, aren't there?

293
00:17:22.784 --> 00:17:25.184
So why did you choose me?

294
00:17:25.184 --> 00:17:26.884
If I were to choose by the amount of experience

295
00:17:26.884 --> 00:17:28.884
and the capabilities of the detective,

296
00:17:28.884 --> 00:17:30.984
there were many.

297
00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:34.784
But when it comes to attractiveness of personality...

298
00:17:34.784 --> 00:17:36.984
The result is obvious.

299
00:17:36.984 --> 00:17:40.084
Who else could I have chosen but you, Mr. Mouri?

300
00:17:40.084 --> 00:17:43.284
Well, your decision is correct, Yukiko!

301
00:17:47.284 --> 00:17:49.584
I'm glad I lived this long.

302
00:17:49.584 --> 00:17:52.284
Well, this cola sure is delicious!

303
00:17:52.284 --> 00:17:53.684
Another cup, please.

304
00:17:57.884 --> 00:18:00.184
Yes, that's right.

305
00:18:00.184 --> 00:18:01.684
Please wait a minute.

306
00:18:01.684 --> 00:18:03.284
It's for you, Mr. Mouri.

307
00:18:03.284 --> 00:18:04.584
For me?

308
00:18:06.484 --> 00:18:07.884
Thank you.

309
00:18:07.884 --> 00:18:11.084
Hello, I'm the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri.

310
00:18:11.084 --> 00:18:13.084
What a guy.

311
00:18:13.084 --> 00:18:16.284
Calling yourself the renown detective.

312
00:18:16.284 --> 00:18:18.084
Inspector Megure!

313
00:18:18.084 --> 00:18:20.984
About that suspicious man who disappeared from the hall.

314
00:18:20.984 --> 00:18:22.684
He had a record.

315
00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:24.084
Really?

316
00:18:24.084 --> 00:18:26.784
Yes, he's a real criminal.

317
00:18:26.784 --> 00:18:29.384
"Shiro Hiraoka (35)" -Shiro Hiraoka, age 35.

318
00:18:29.384 --> 00:18:30.884
He grabs business secrets of companies

319
00:18:30.884 --> 00:18:33.584
and blackmails them for money.

320
00:18:33.584 --> 00:18:37.184
He is notorious in the underworld for sucking his victims to the bone

321
00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:39.984
and goes by the name, Hiraoka the Piranha.

322
00:18:39.984 --> 00:18:43.284
Which means if Hiraoka is after him...

323
00:18:43.284 --> 00:18:46.184
Mr. Ishimoto is probably being blackmailed

324
00:18:46.184 --> 00:18:48.984
by Hiraoka for some reason.

325
00:18:48.984 --> 00:18:50.984
Judging from Mr. Ishimoto's character,

326
00:18:50.984 --> 00:18:53.084
he probably refused,

327
00:18:53.084 --> 00:18:59.084
so Hiraoka was enraged and decided to kill him.

328
00:19:00.684 --> 00:19:03.084
"Mouri Detective Agency"

329
00:19:09.284 --> 00:19:12.084
This time you infuriated a professional killer like me.

330
00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:14.084
You were very unlucky.

331
00:19:14.084 --> 00:19:17.284
But there is just one way you can save yourself.

332
00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:21.284
You will have to kill me.

333
00:19:22.984 --> 00:19:25.984
Oh, I was wondering where you were.

334
00:19:25.984 --> 00:19:28.084
And I find you watching TV.

335
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.084
It's time to go to bed.

336
00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:34.784
Are you listening to me, Conan?

337
00:19:34.784 --> 00:19:36.884
-I'm turning the TV off. -Wait!

338
00:19:57.384 --> 00:20:00.384
I get it! That's how it was done!

339
00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:02.184
What are you talking about?

340
00:20:02.184 --> 00:20:07.884
We've been completely deceived by the culprit.

341
00:20:07.884 --> 00:20:11.284
What a well devised murder.

342
00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:15.284
But I don't have enough proof to prove how it was done yet.

343
00:20:29.684 --> 00:20:32.684
Mr. Mouri, the phone is ringing!

344
00:20:33.484 --> 00:20:36.084
Oh, no! I've fallen asleep.

345
00:20:36.084 --> 00:20:37.384
I'm very sorry.

346
00:20:38.784 --> 00:20:40.484
Yes, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

347
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:41.784
This is Mr. Mouri.

348
00:20:41.784 --> 00:20:43.684
We've got trouble, Mr. Mouri!

349
00:20:43.684 --> 00:20:46.284
Inspector? What's up?

350
00:20:46.284 --> 00:20:49.384
Hiraoka Shiro's dead body was found!

351
00:20:49.384 --> 00:20:52.384
What? Where?

352
00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:54.784
It seems that he slipped and fell

353
00:20:54.784 --> 00:20:57.284
at the dilapidated building where he was hiding.

354
00:20:57.284 --> 00:21:00.984
He seems to have hit his head then, and died.

355
00:21:00.984 --> 00:21:03.084
Is it an accident or...

356
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:04.584
We don't know yet.

357
00:21:04.584 --> 00:21:07.084
We're going to go to the site now.

358
00:21:07.084 --> 00:21:10.084
I'll contact you as soon as I get the details.

359
00:21:10.084 --> 00:21:13.084
This area has been completely surrounded by the police.

360
00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:23.384
"Mouri Detective Agency"

361
00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:26.984
Good morning.

362
00:21:26.984 --> 00:21:28.884
What? Is that true?

363
00:21:28.884 --> 00:21:32.284
So, until you can be sure that Mr. Ishimoto is safe,

364
00:21:32.284 --> 00:21:34.684
you can't come home?

365
00:21:34.684 --> 00:21:36.884
Okay, I understand.

366
00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:42.184
Is it from Pops?

367
00:21:42.184 --> 00:21:45.684
Yes. He says that the Mr. Hiraoka that was in the picture,

368
00:21:45.684 --> 00:21:50.684
and thought to be the one who shot Mr. Ishimoto was found dead.

369
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.284
What? Wasn't he murdered?

370
00:21:53.284 --> 00:21:57.184
I guess it was an accident because he fell from the stairs.

371
00:21:57.184 --> 00:21:59.984
It seems he slipped and fell from the stairs at the dilapidated building

372
00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:02.484
that he was using as a hide-out and hit is head hard.

373
00:22:02.484 --> 00:22:05.384
No, that was no accident.

374
00:22:05.384 --> 00:22:10.084
If my assumption is correct, it's homicide!

375
00:22:10.084 --> 00:22:15.084
The real culprit killed Hiraoka who knew the secret, to shut him up.

376
00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:17.284
This case which started with

377
00:22:17.284 --> 00:22:19.484
what looked to be that Mr. Ishimoto was blackmailed,

378
00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:21.784
look like a simple case at first glance,

379
00:22:21.784 --> 00:22:24.484
but a terrible truth is behind it.

380
00:22:25.884 --> 00:22:28.184
I'll find the one string of truth

381
00:22:28.184 --> 00:22:32.684
from among the complicatedly tangled strings.

382
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:10.484
"Next Episode"

383
00:24:10.484 --> 00:24:15.984
The thing is she has a lover called Kenichi Shibata.

384
00:24:15.984 --> 00:24:17.684
Just as I thought.

385
00:24:17.684 --> 00:24:21.184
Okay, let me tell you the whole truth.

386
00:24:21.184 --> 00:24:23.784
The real culprit is you!

387
00:24:27.484 --> 00:24:33.305
Next Conan, "Mysterious Assassin (Part 2)"

388
00:24:33.886 --> 00:24:36.586
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:36.586 --> 00:24:38.286
