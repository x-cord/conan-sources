1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.140
An old pot is found in the storeroom of Dr. Agasa's house.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.340
Wanting the pot to be appraised,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.340
Doc uploaded the pot on a video site,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.540
but who would've known that doing

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.740
so would lead to an incident like this.

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.540
While we were out buying groceries to make curry,

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.540
we got home to find that Dr. Agasa

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.940
was fainted after being attacked with a stun gun,

9
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.940
and that Ayumi had been kidnapped.

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.740
At first we thought that somebody had come after the pot,

11
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.640
but the pot was found left behind.

12
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.240
And, instead, the carpet that was found together

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.540
with the pot was gone.

14
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.540
It seems to have been used to carry Ayumi out.

15
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
Mail sent by the culprit was eventually received.

16
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
It demanded that the cat that was shown

17
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.340
in the attachment be searched for,

18
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.540
and that Ayumi will be kept hostage in exchange for the cat.

19
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.540
We split up to look for the cat, but to no avail.

20
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.640
It's getting close to sundown

21
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.940
and we were starting to get panicky

22
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.540
when the culprit sent us another mail.

23
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.340
It said that they had found the cat on their own

24
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.940
so they would be releasing Ayumi.

25
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.140
Ayumi was found safe,

26
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.440
but what on earth was the culprit after anyway.

27
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.540
If all cases were men,

28
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

29
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.840
Glimpses of the Organization are here and there.

30
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.040
Could they be after the pot, the cat or Haibara?

31
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.840
His name is Detective Conan.

34
00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:08.477
"Doc's Video Site (Part 2)"

35
00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:13.477
In other words, the cat keeper of some rich person,

36
00:03:13.477 --> 00:03:17.577
carelessly makes the cat get away and panics.

37
00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:19.477
Then, wanting to get the cat back,

38
00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:22.377
he commits a kidnapping case.

39
00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:24.077
But, it ends up being a stupid story

40
00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:26.077
where the keeper eventually finds the cat on his own.

41
00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.177
But if so, he should've just truthfully said,

42
00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:29.877
"Since it's my master's cat,

43
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:32.977
if you find it, please return it".

44
00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:36.277
I wonder. If people find out that his master is super rich,

45
00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:38.477
maybe he was afraid that an exorbitant reward would be demanded

46
00:03:38.477 --> 00:03:41.477
and that his master would find out that the cat got away.

47
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:44.877
No, I don't think it's that simple of a case.

48
00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:47.677
No matter if we went out shopping,

49
00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:51.677
unless the culprit knew that only Doc and Ayumi were staying back home,

50
00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:53.777
it's unthinkable that he would try to break in

51
00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.877
with just a stun gun.

52
00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:59.877
Besides, we were gone for only less than 30 minutes.

53
00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:02.577
If it was a house that he were entering for the first time,

54
00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:05.377
do you think he could've made Doc faint,

55
00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:08.377
then check to see if the cat was anywhere in the house,

56
00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:13.177
wrap Ayumi in the carpet and carry her out?

57
00:04:13.177 --> 00:04:14.977
In addition, the culprit also found Doc

58
00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:16.877
and Ayumi's cell phones too.

59
00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:19.077
Then don't tell me that the culprit...

60
00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:23.277
Yeah, he knew, that Doc and Haibara were living here,

61
00:04:23.277 --> 00:04:25.677
just the two of them together in this house.

62
00:04:25.677 --> 00:04:29.277
And that we four came over here to play often too.

63
00:04:29.277 --> 00:04:32.777
As well as the fact that all of us have cell phones too.

64
00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:35.277
But, how did they get that information?

65
00:04:35.277 --> 00:04:38.877
Didn't anyone you don't know recently come over?

66
00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.677
Come to think of it, yes.

67
00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:41.977
About 3 groups of people.

68
00:04:41.977 --> 00:04:43.077
3 groups?

69
00:04:43.077 --> 00:04:45.477
You see, they came after seeing

70
00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:47.677
the video site that I just showed you.

71
00:04:47.677 --> 00:04:48.677
And?

72
00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:51.277
What kind of people did the 3 groups consist of?

73
00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:56.177
The first group was a young pair of sisters.

74
00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:58.277
They lifted the pot, tapped on it

75
00:04:58.277 --> 00:04:59.977
and kept staring at it for a while

76
00:04:59.977 --> 00:05:02.877
but, they asked me to sell it to them for 500 yen.

77
00:05:02.877 --> 00:05:07.277
500 yen? Is that pot so invaluable?

78
00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:09.677
I asked the same question too.

79
00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:11.277
They weren't sure either,

80
00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.977
but it seems that at the cost of 500 yen,

81
00:05:12.977 --> 00:05:15.777
they thought they could use it as a flower pot.

82
00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:18.477
They asked me to check on it in more detail,

83
00:05:18.477 --> 00:05:20.777
but they left saying that their legs went numb.

84
00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:22.777
Was the pot left on the floor?

85
00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:26.077
Yeah. On top of that carpet.

86
00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:28.877
I thought it would look nicer that way.

87
00:05:28.877 --> 00:05:31.677
The next group that came was a middle-aged couple.

88
00:05:31.677 --> 00:05:33.077
They carefully checked the pot

89
00:05:33.077 --> 00:05:36.277
using a magnifying glass without touching the pot at all.

90
00:05:36.277 --> 00:05:38.677
And? What did they say?

91
00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:42.077
They told me that maybe it could be a very valuable pot,

92
00:05:42.077 --> 00:05:46.877
so to take it to a legitimate appraiser.

93
00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:49.077
They also told me that there may be people

94
00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:50.877
who'd want to buy it at an unreasonably cheap price

95
00:05:50.877 --> 00:05:54.877
so that it may be better if I don't show it too much to others.

96
00:05:54.877 --> 00:05:57.277
Then, what about the 3rd group?

97
00:05:57.277 --> 00:05:59.877
They were a very rude father and son!

98
00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:02.877
After touching the pot just a little and looking inside it

99
00:06:02.877 --> 00:06:05.877
the son asked, "How much do you think this is?"

100
00:06:05.877 --> 00:06:07.977
He said so, with a grin on his face

101
00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:10.577
so I got upset and said, "It's about 500,000 yen!"

102
00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:13.077
I told him that I'll give him the carpet along with it

103
00:06:13.077 --> 00:06:14.177
if he bought it now.

104
00:06:14.177 --> 00:06:17.377
The father said, "You've gotta be joking".

105
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.777
The son also said laughing,

106
00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:21.277
"I pity people who don't have an eye for things".

107
00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:23.577
So I got angry and kicked them out of the house!

108
00:06:23.577 --> 00:06:27.877
And? Was Haibara close to you then?

109
00:06:27.877 --> 00:06:32.277
No, the three groups came while Ai was in school, you see.

110
00:06:33.277 --> 00:06:35.177
Come to think of it.

111
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:36.977
There was someone who asked a lot about Ai,

112
00:06:36.977 --> 00:06:38.477
including what time she comes back from school,

113
00:06:38.477 --> 00:06:40.977
about her friends,

114
00:06:40.977 --> 00:06:43.477
or about what she usually does on Saturdays and Sundays.

115
00:06:43.477 --> 00:06:45.977
Isn't that person the culprit?

116
00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:48.877
Don't you remember who it was?

117
00:06:48.877 --> 00:06:53.177
No... I think it was someone among the three groups though.

118
00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:54.977
Wasn't there anyone among

119
00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:57.277
the three groups that asked about a cat?

120
00:06:57.277 --> 00:07:00.777
Especially someone who asked about this Russian Blue?

121
00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:04.377
It was mostly talk about the pot, you see.

122
00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:06.677
Russian Blue?

123
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:10.877
If I remember correctly, Ran's mother also has a Russian Blue.

124
00:07:10.877 --> 00:07:12.077
If it's a pot and cat,

125
00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:13.677
you can find it on a pot-cat video site, right?

126
00:07:13.677 --> 00:07:15.177
What's that?

127
00:07:15.177 --> 00:07:18.777
The cat going inside the pot is really cute.

128
00:07:19.777 --> 00:07:20.877
Hey, Doc!

129
00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:23.377
What did name the title of the video you uploaded?

130
00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:24.977
If I remember correctly...

131
00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:26.377
I think it was, "Although this pot is like casting pearls before swine,

132
00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:27.677
that is, throwing gold before cats for me,

133
00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:29.877
I would like to have it appraised".

134
00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:33.477
If so, we can search for videos concerning cats and pots.

135
00:07:35.777 --> 00:07:38.777
I found it. It's Ran's mother's video.

136
00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:42.177
It's one above Doc's video site.

137
00:07:42.177 --> 00:07:44.177
It's a cat pot!

138
00:07:44.177 --> 00:07:47.077
No, don't go in there.

139
00:07:47.077 --> 00:07:48.477
How cute!

140
00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:51.677
Goro chan, say hi to everyone!

141
00:07:52.877 --> 00:07:56.877
Hey, doesn't that cat look like the culprit's cat?

142
00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.777
True, even the background looks similar!

143
00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:02.677
But how come Ms. Kisaki's cat...

144
00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:07.677
There's no reason that she would pass me out with a stun gun, is there?

145
00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:12.477
Wait. I wonder why the culprit didn't use the stun gun on Ayumi?

146
00:08:12.477 --> 00:08:14.577
If he passed her out like he did Doc,

147
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:18.377
he wouldn't have had to change his voice using helium gas.

148
00:08:18.377 --> 00:08:20.077
I wonder why?

149
00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:25.277
There something on your ear.

150
00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:27.877
This is when I tried to run from the culprit,

151
00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:31.577
coffee spilled, and I was pushed downward on it

152
00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.877
so that's why I got coffee on my hood.

153
00:08:34.877 --> 00:08:38.377
You sure got a lot of coffee on your hood.

154
00:08:38.377 --> 00:08:40.877
When I was wrapped around with the carpet,

155
00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:43.277
the coffee came soaking all the way up to my ear

156
00:08:43.277 --> 00:08:46.077
and really felt gooey!

157
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:48.877
I'm sorry I got your clothes dirty, Ai.

158
00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:52.877
No problem, I can get it clean by washing it.

159
00:08:52.877 --> 00:08:55.377
I see. So in other words,

160
00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:59.277
the culprit's target was neither Haibara, the pot nor the cat.

161
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:02.177
So, what do you intend to do about this case then?

162
00:09:02.177 --> 00:09:04.277
Are you going to report it to the police anyway?

163
00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.577
I guess so

164
00:09:05.577 --> 00:09:08.877
since it's a fact that Ayumi was kidnapped too.

165
00:09:08.877 --> 00:09:11.477
But, I wonder if they'd believe us?

166
00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:13.577
A story like two people wearing caps

167
00:09:13.577 --> 00:09:15.277
suddenly break into the house,

168
00:09:15.277 --> 00:09:17.477
make Doc faint using a stun gun,

169
00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:21.277
wrap Ayumi inside the carpet and carry her off.

170
00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:22.677
Moreover, that the purpose of the culprit

171
00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:25.577
was for us to find the cat owned by his master

172
00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:27.577
that ran away near here.

173
00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:28.977
True.

174
00:09:28.977 --> 00:09:31.277
The two kidnappers sent us mail demanding for us

175
00:09:31.277 --> 00:09:33.077
to look for their cat

176
00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:35.377
from the cell phone they stole from Dr. Agasa.

177
00:09:35.377 --> 00:09:39.077
And that mail was sent to Ayumi's cell phone

178
00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.977
that was inside the pot.

179
00:09:40.977 --> 00:09:42.677
On top of that, both kidnappers

180
00:09:42.677 --> 00:09:44.977
had changed their voices with helium gas

181
00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:46.577
and we've got no clue.

182
00:09:46.577 --> 00:09:48.777
I'm sure that Ayumi who was wrapped in the carpet

183
00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:51.977
wouldn't have had an idea of where she was taken to

184
00:09:51.977 --> 00:09:53.877
nor how she got back either.

185
00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:56.177
But, Ayumi, you said

186
00:09:56.177 --> 00:09:57.677
that they let you out of the carpet once

187
00:09:57.677 --> 00:09:59.977
and let you drink water, right?

188
00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:02.377
Weren't you at the culprits' hide out?

189
00:10:03.377 --> 00:10:05.377
It was dark and I couldn't see well,

190
00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:08.777
but it seems that I was in a moving car or something.

191
00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:14.677
The only clue that we have is this image of the cat

192
00:10:14.677 --> 00:10:16.877
that the culprit demanded us to look for, but...

193
00:10:16.877 --> 00:10:18.977
Since it looks exactly like the image of the cat

194
00:10:18.977 --> 00:10:22.177
that Ms. Kisaki had uploaded on her site.

195
00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:24.177
It could be that they borrowed

196
00:10:24.177 --> 00:10:26.977
the image of the same type of cat

197
00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:29.277
and sent it to us.

198
00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:32.077
But, somebody may have witnessed

199
00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:34.477
suspicious people carrying out the carpet,

200
00:10:34.477 --> 00:10:37.477
so I think we should contact the police either way.

201
00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:41.377
Why don't we call them after we make the curry?

202
00:10:41.377 --> 00:10:44.677
I mean, I'm really starving.

203
00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.077
I guess so.

204
00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:48.677
Okay, I guess I'll go take a bath then.

205
00:10:48.677 --> 00:10:51.377
Because my ear is still stained with coffee.

206
00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:52.677
Hold it!

207
00:10:53.877 --> 00:10:55.877
I'm sorry, but will you take a bath

208
00:10:55.877 --> 00:10:57.877
after the culprits are arrested.

209
00:10:58.877 --> 00:11:01.677
Because that coffee stain is important evidence

210
00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:05.377
that shows that the culprit pushed you down on the stain,

211
00:11:05.377 --> 00:11:08.177
rendered you helpless, wrapped you in the carpet

212
00:11:08.177 --> 00:11:10.277
and carried you away, you see.

213
00:11:10.277 --> 00:11:15.177
What? You mean I can't take a bath until the culprits are caught?

214
00:11:15.177 --> 00:11:18.377
Well, it'll only be a little while.

215
00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.477
Because we're going to raid

216
00:11:20.477 --> 00:11:21.977
the culprits' place together starting now.

217
00:11:21.977 --> 00:11:22.977
What?

218
00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:26.077
Are you saying that you figured out who the culprits are?

219
00:11:26.077 --> 00:11:30.077
Yeah, it's probably somebody that you know, Doc.

220
00:11:30.077 --> 00:11:33.677
Somebody I know?

221
00:11:44.986 --> 00:11:46.586
Somebody I know?

222
00:11:46.586 --> 00:11:48.886
Don't tell me that you're saying that Ms. Kisaki is the culprit.

223
00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:50.586
No.

224
00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:53.686
Just as you said the image of that cat

225
00:11:53.686 --> 00:11:56.386
was one that the culprit sent at random.

226
00:11:56.386 --> 00:12:00.486
And, it just happened to be Attorney Kisaki's cat.

227
00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.286
At random?

228
00:12:02.286 --> 00:12:04.186
You mean the culprit didn't kidnap Ayumi

229
00:12:04.186 --> 00:12:06.886
in order to search for the cat?

230
00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:09.686
No, anything would've been fine.

231
00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:14.586
As long as they had something that sounded appropriate enough

232
00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:16.386
to carry Ayumi out of the house

233
00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:17.686
after wrapping her in the carpet.

234
00:12:17.686 --> 00:12:19.986
You mean, they demanded the cat to be searched for

235
00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:21.986
just as a make-shift reason?

236
00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:25.686
Yeah. Don't you think it's strange?

237
00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:28.586
Doc was shot with a stun gun that fainted him and yet

238
00:12:28.586 --> 00:12:32.286
all they did to Ayumi was seal her mouth with masking tape.

239
00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:34.386
Thanks to that, we found out from the conversation of the culprits

240
00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:37.586
that they came here to look for the cat that ran away,

241
00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:39.986
and that they had no choice

242
00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:41.586
but to wrap Ayumi in a carpet

243
00:12:41.586 --> 00:12:44.786
in order to make us search for that cat.

244
00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:48.486
But, if they made Ayumi faint like they did to Doc,

245
00:12:48.486 --> 00:12:49.986
to begin with, they wouldn't have had

246
00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:52.486
to change their voices using helium gas, did they?

247
00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:53.886
I guess so.

248
00:12:53.886 --> 00:12:56.986
In spite of that, the only reason for them doing so would've been

249
00:12:56.986 --> 00:13:01.186
because the culprits wanted Ayumi to hear their conversation.

250
00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:03.486
They did so in order to distract everyone

251
00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:06.686
from the fact that they were actually after the carpet.

252
00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:08.486
What? The carpet?

253
00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:11.886
You mean that old looking carpet is expensive?

254
00:13:11.886 --> 00:13:14.286
No, I'm pretty sure that this is cheap stuff.

255
00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:16.386
Then, why?

256
00:13:16.386 --> 00:13:18.786
Like Doc was saying just a while ago.

257
00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:20.386
Although the back side of the carpet was stained,

258
00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:23.486
the front had no stains what so ever on it when it was returned.

259
00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:25.986
While Ayumi was wrapped in the carpet,

260
00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:27.786
the coffee that soaked through her hood

261
00:13:27.786 --> 00:13:29.986
stained her ear too, you know.

262
00:13:29.986 --> 00:13:33.686
Then, shouldn't there be a coffee stain somewhere on the carpet?

263
00:13:33.686 --> 00:13:36.586
However, the fact that there is no such stain anywhere means...

264
00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:37.886
I see.

265
00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:41.986
They switched the carpet when they let Ayumi drink water.

266
00:13:41.986 --> 00:13:43.186
Yeah.

267
00:13:43.186 --> 00:13:46.286
They let Ayuymi out of the carpet once in the dark

268
00:13:46.286 --> 00:13:49.386
so that she wouldn't realize that they switched the carpet.

269
00:13:49.386 --> 00:13:51.086
I'm sure that they had another carpet

270
00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:53.186
that looked similar to this one inside their car beforehand,

271
00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:56.386
so that they could switch it right away.

272
00:13:56.386 --> 00:13:59.486
But then they didn't have to go as far as to kidnap Ayumi, did they?

273
00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:02.886
Right! All they had to do was steal the carpet!

274
00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:04.486
I see!

275
00:14:04.486 --> 00:14:05.986
If the carpet were stolen,

276
00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:07.386
it would be reported to the police as such,

277
00:14:07.386 --> 00:14:09.686
so they wouldn't be able to sell it off even if they wanted to.

278
00:14:09.686 --> 00:14:15.786
Yeah. The pattern of the carpet is clearly shown on your video too.

279
00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:17.986
But, I don't think I have any acquaintances

280
00:14:17.986 --> 00:14:20.186
that would do something like that around me.

281
00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:24.086
It could be someone that you recently met just once.

282
00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:25.986
Recently?

283
00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:28.386
Don't tell me it's the one who came to appraise that pot.

284
00:14:28.386 --> 00:14:29.486
Yeah.

285
00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:32.286
Or the sisters who were lifting the pot,

286
00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:34.586
touching it and staring at it for a while,

287
00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:37.086
the couple who were carefully checking the pot using a magnifying glass

288
00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:39.586
without touching it at all.

289
00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:41.286
Or, the father and son who were told by you

290
00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:43.286
that you would sell the pot along with the carpet for 500,000 yen

291
00:14:43.286 --> 00:14:45.786
and laughed about it.

292
00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:48.386
That would make the last father and son suspicious.

293
00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:50.886
Yes. I'm sure they knew the real value of the carpet

294
00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:53.386
and wanted to buy it at an even lower price.

295
00:14:53.386 --> 00:14:54.986
No, just the opposite.

296
00:14:54.986 --> 00:14:58.086
They laughed because Doc mentioned a price that was much too cheap.

297
00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:00.686
Judging from the fact that they wanted

298
00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:02.386
to get a hold of your carpet despite

299
00:15:02.386 --> 00:15:03.886
having to kidnap a child means that your carpet

300
00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:05.586
was probably a Persian carpet.

301
00:15:05.586 --> 00:15:07.786
It's said that not one carpet has the same pattern

302
00:15:07.786 --> 00:15:08.886
and depending on the carpet,

303
00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:11.286
it could easily range over 10 million yen.

304
00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:13.486
What? Ten million yen?

305
00:15:13.486 --> 00:15:15.286
It's true that looking at the pattern of aging

306
00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:17.586
on the outside and inside of the object in question,

307
00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:19.786
is one way of appraisal,

308
00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:23.186
but the father and son had an eye for antiques

309
00:15:23.186 --> 00:15:24.386
because they could tell the value by just a slight touch

310
00:15:24.386 --> 00:15:26.386
and quick look inside the pot.

311
00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:29.086
I'm sure they could tell right off that it was a Persian carpet,

312
00:15:29.086 --> 00:15:31.286
but they aren't the culprits.

313
00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:32.586
Why?

314
00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.186
If they went as far as to cause an incident like this

315
00:15:34.186 --> 00:15:36.386
just to get a hold of the carpet,

316
00:15:36.386 --> 00:15:37.686
there's no reason why they wouldn't go

317
00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:39.586
for an offer of 500,000 yen, is there?

318
00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:43.286
Then, you mean the very first pair of sisters who came here is the culprit?

319
00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:46.086
Why isn't it the couple that came here second?

320
00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:47.486
Of course not.

321
00:15:47.486 --> 00:15:49.986
Because the couple kindly told me

322
00:15:49.986 --> 00:15:51.886
that the pot may be valuable

323
00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:54.386
so to show it to an appraiser.

324
00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.686
They were referring to the pot, weren't they?

325
00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:58.086
Besides, to put it accurately,

326
00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:01.686
they recommended you to take it over to an appraiser

327
00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:03.786
to get it appraised, didn't they?

328
00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:04.786
Yeah.

329
00:16:04.786 --> 00:16:06.686
On second thought, they could be telling you

330
00:16:06.686 --> 00:16:09.086
not to call anyone here anymore because they don't want anyone

331
00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:12.886
to realize that it is a Persian carpet, right?

332
00:16:12.886 --> 00:16:15.086
Besides, contrary to the sisters who raised

333
00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:17.186
the pot up and stared at it for a while,

334
00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:19.486
the couple didn't touch the pot even once

335
00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:21.586
and checked it with a magnifying glass, right?

336
00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:23.786
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:26.886
The sisters who had their minds only on the pot, would've done so,

338
00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:29.086
but not so for the couple.

339
00:16:29.086 --> 00:16:31.886
If you had the pot on the carpet,

340
00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:34.686
they could've seen the carpet through the magnifying glass, right?

341
00:16:34.686 --> 00:16:38.286
I see! The thing that the couple was checking...

342
00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:40.186
Was the pattern of the carpet.

343
00:16:40.186 --> 00:16:41.586
They were not only checking

344
00:16:41.586 --> 00:16:44.386
if it was a real Persian carpet,

345
00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:46.986
but also confirming whether it was the really the carpet

346
00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:49.486
that they were looking for.

347
00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:52.586
They probably saw the carpet once somewhere

348
00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:55.686
and were dying to have it.

349
00:16:55.686 --> 00:16:58.486
Otherwise, they would never jump

350
00:16:58.486 --> 00:17:01.286
at something they coincidentally saw at a video site.

351
00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:04.286
Then, they used the excuse of appraising the pot

352
00:17:04.286 --> 00:17:06.686
and came here to check out the carpet.

353
00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:08.286
They found out that Doc not only didn't know the value of the pot,

354
00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:10.786
but neither he have any knowledge of the value of the carpet.

355
00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:12.286
I'm sure that after finding out that just Haibara

356
00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:16.886
and you were living here together, they thought up the crime.

357
00:17:16.886 --> 00:17:21.086
But, how are we going to pinpoint where the culprits are?

358
00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:22.786
Judging from the fact that they didn't want Ayumi

359
00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:24.986
to recognize their voices,

360
00:17:24.986 --> 00:17:28.286
it's most likely that they are running a store near here.

361
00:17:28.286 --> 00:17:30.086
We can probably find them quite easily

362
00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:32.086
if we narrow the shops down to those that sell carpets.

363
00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:35.986
Yes, yes, I'm already doing so.

364
00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:37.786
I found it.

365
00:17:37.786 --> 00:17:40.786
Interior shop Kanbe on 3rd Avenue.

366
00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:42.886
It seems that they carry carpets too.

367
00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:46.186
The president's face also seems to be on the website,

368
00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:48.386
but is he the one?

369
00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:51.786
That's right. It's him.

370
00:17:51.786 --> 00:17:53.686
No mistake about it.

371
00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:56.486
Bingo.

372
00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:04.786
If I remember correctly, you're...

373
00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:07.486
It's amazing how you found my residence.

374
00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:09.486
When I went to your shop last week,

375
00:18:09.486 --> 00:18:10.786
I was told that you were off from work

376
00:18:10.786 --> 00:18:13.986
because of a cold, you see.

377
00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:15.286
But, judging from the looks of it,

378
00:18:15.286 --> 00:18:17.686
it seems you've completely recovered already.

379
00:18:17.686 --> 00:18:19.786
Huh? Oh, no.

380
00:18:20.886 --> 00:18:23.586
I still have a bit of cough.

381
00:18:23.586 --> 00:18:25.286
By the way, what brings you here?

382
00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:28.386
I heard that your shop carries carpets too,

383
00:18:28.386 --> 00:18:31.686
so I wanted you to look at the carpet I have.

384
00:18:31.686 --> 00:18:32.786
I see.

385
00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:35.486
And, who are those children?

386
00:18:37.086 --> 00:18:40.886
I couldn't bring it here alone so I had them help me.

387
00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:49.886
It's very well made but...

388
00:18:49.886 --> 00:18:52.186
It seems to be fake.

389
00:18:52.186 --> 00:18:54.586
Just as I thought, after all.

390
00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:58.786
Well, there are many fake Persian carpets going around.

391
00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:00.186
Then, is this carpet

392
00:19:00.186 --> 00:19:03.086
that is standing against the wall authentic?

393
00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:06.286
Yeah. That one's authentic.

394
00:19:07.686 --> 00:19:10.486
There something stuck between the carpet.

395
00:19:10.486 --> 00:19:12.086
It looks to be a picture.

396
00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:13.886
A picture of what?

397
00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.386
This is...

398
00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:19.086
It's a picture of a carpet!

399
00:19:19.086 --> 00:19:20.986
It looks just like Doc's carpet.

400
00:19:20.986 --> 00:19:22.986
But why would a picture like this be here?

401
00:19:22.986 --> 00:19:24.686
Oh... well...

402
00:19:24.686 --> 00:19:26.786
My wife is a bit of a scatterbrain, you see.

403
00:19:26.786 --> 00:19:28.586
Right?

404
00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:30.486
Well... Yes!

405
00:19:30.486 --> 00:19:34.386
I always get newspapers and stuff stuck in between.

406
00:19:34.386 --> 00:19:36.386
I thought that you rushed and folded the carpet

407
00:19:36.386 --> 00:19:39.886
because Doc came home while you were comparing the carpet with the picture,

408
00:19:39.886 --> 00:19:42.086
so it got stuck in between,

409
00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:45.486
but I guess it was just my imagination.

410
00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.486
Let's try spreading it out then!

411
00:19:48.486 --> 00:19:49.886
Yes!

412
00:19:49.886 --> 00:19:51.686
Hold it!

413
00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:57.986
Oh, my. It looks just like Doc's carpet.

414
00:19:57.986 --> 00:20:00.886
But, it seems the pattern is a bit different?

415
00:20:00.886 --> 00:20:04.786
It seems that the carpet in the picture is this one.

416
00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:06.486
Oh goodness!

417
00:20:06.486 --> 00:20:09.286
There's ear shaped stain.

418
00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:13.786
Judging from the smell. It seems to be coffee.

419
00:20:13.786 --> 00:20:15.186
My wife did that too.

420
00:20:15.186 --> 00:20:18.786
Because I'm a scatterbrain, I was rushing and...

421
00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:20.886
Don't you know?

422
00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.486
The shape of an ear is called an ear print

423
00:20:23.486 --> 00:20:28.986
and like fingerprints there is no one person with the same prints.

424
00:20:28.986 --> 00:20:30.286
So, I'm sure that if we match the stain

425
00:20:30.286 --> 00:20:34.486
with Ayumi's ear print, it'll readily become obvious...

426
00:20:36.086 --> 00:20:38.686
that you're the ones, the kidnappers,

427
00:20:38.686 --> 00:20:42.386
who wrapped Ayumi in this carpet.

428
00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:43.786
What's with you?

429
00:20:43.786 --> 00:20:46.786
Who the hell are you?

430
00:20:46.786 --> 00:20:48.586
Conan Edogawa.

431
00:20:48.586 --> 00:20:50.186
A detective.

432
00:20:51.186 --> 00:20:53.886
After a while, the police arrived

433
00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:56.886
and the kidnappers were taken to the police.

434
00:20:56.886 --> 00:20:58.886
It seems that the carpet that Doc had belonged

435
00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:01.586
to a certain tycoon, but since he passed away,

436
00:21:01.586 --> 00:21:03.286
his bereaved family who received the carpet as a keepsake,

437
00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:05.686
seem to have passed it on from person to person,

438
00:21:05.686 --> 00:21:09.286
where it ended up at Doc's place.

439
00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:11.086
The kidnapper couple seems to have

440
00:21:11.086 --> 00:21:12.886
worked on the interior of that tycoon too.

441
00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:14.586
And after hearing that his bereaved family unaware

442
00:21:14.586 --> 00:21:16.786
of the value of the carpet sold it off,

443
00:21:16.786 --> 00:21:19.986
had been pursuing its whereabouts.

444
00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:22.086
They happened to find the carpet

445
00:21:22.086 --> 00:21:25.886
because Mrs. Kanbe was hooked on the "Pot Cat Video Site".

446
00:21:25.886 --> 00:21:28.186
They seem to have come up with their scheme when they saw the girl

447
00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:30.486
that was reflected on the lens of his glasses,

448
00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:32.986
and when they found Attorney Kisaki's cat one above Doc's video site,

449
00:21:32.986 --> 00:21:35.186
they decided to use it to get a hold of the carpet they were dying to have.

450
00:21:35.186 --> 00:21:39.086
That seems to have been the motive for the crime they committed.

451
00:21:39.086 --> 00:21:42.186
By the way, after finding out that he owned

452
00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:44.086
a genuine Persian carpet, Doc was delighted.

453
00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:45.786
However, he was disappointed to hear that

454
00:21:45.786 --> 00:21:47.286
he would only get the carpet back

455
00:21:47.286 --> 00:21:48.686
after the incident and trial of the case end,

456
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:50.886
which would take several months.

457
00:21:50.886 --> 00:21:53.386
His dream of wanting to purchase a new Beetle

458
00:21:53.386 --> 00:21:55.586
would have to wait for a while now.

459
00:21:57.086 --> 00:21:59.986
But I wonder if everything will be okay?

460
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.286
What?

461
00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:04.286
My reflection that was on Doc's glasses.

462
00:22:04.286 --> 00:22:06.586
It's been distributed throughout the world, wasn't it?

463
00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:08.086
No problem!

464
00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:10.286
That video site has already been deleted,

465
00:22:10.286 --> 00:22:11.586
and besides the kidnapper also said that

466
00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:14.086
he coincidentally saw you only

467
00:22:14.086 --> 00:22:17.386
when he zoomed in on the pattern of the carpet.

468
00:22:17.386 --> 00:22:22.486
Hold it. How did she find Haibara's image?

469
00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:50.586
Delete...

470
00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:54.686
Delete.

471
00:23:56.486 --> 00:24:00.086
If it's data it can be deleted right away, but...

472
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:08.086

Now, we shall take you ladies and gentlemen

476
00:24:19.686 --> 00:24:22.686
beyond the world of dreams to the distant Milky Way.

477

Everybody, outside!

I'd like to have a taste of it too.

485
00:24:58.586 --> 00:24:59.786
No chocolate for you.
