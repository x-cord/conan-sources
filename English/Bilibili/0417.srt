1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.240
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.340
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.240
Today's story is the climax of the Butsumetsu mystery.

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.540
Ran's casual remark helps clear-up the mystery!

5
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.640
It rings a bell to something that was almost overlooked!

6
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:46.845
We were invited to a wealthy person's residence in Shizuoka prefecture.

10
00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:48.245
At that residence,

11
00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.445
for the past few years,

12
00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:53.145
on the 4th of Butsumetsu, a phenomenon was always said to occur.

13
00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:57.145
And on October 4th,

14
00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:59.645
there were two victims in the house.

15
00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:03.045
What? Fingerprints were detected from the rope and medicine bottle?

16
00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:07.745
And? Whose fingerprints did it match?

17
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.645
Well...

18
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:14.145
It doesn't match anyone who works in this house.

19
00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:17.045
It's an unknown fingerprint.

20
00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:24.445
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Solution)"

21
00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:27.445
Then we know it's an outsider who did it.

22
00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.945
Can we go back to our rooms and rest?

23
00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:35.745
Yes. A policeman will be right outside each of your rooms,

24
00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:37.145
but please get some rest.

25
00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:45.245
Hey, where does Mr. Sekiguchi live and what does he do?

26
00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.645
His company is...

27
00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:48.945
Mr. Watabiki?

28
00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:50.945
Yes.

29
00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:54.945
It's Sekiguchi Securities at Umeki City, Nishi-ku, Yokohama.

30
00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:56.445
Detailed, aren't you?

31
00:02:56.445 --> 00:03:00.945
I go to pick Mr. Sekiguchi up whenever he comes here.

32
00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:02.745
He's memo crazy.

33
00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:03.845
Memo crazy?

34
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.245
By the way, wasn't it in Yokohama that...

35
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:09.345
Yes, my brother.

36
00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:12.345
What is it, brother? At this time of night!

37
00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:15.045
Toshimichi Sekiguchi? Yes, I know him.

38
00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:17.445
I met him a few times when he was still a newcomer.

39
00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:20.745
I remember him well because I didn't like him.

40
00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:22.245
So what's with him?

41
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:26.945
He was found hanging from a rope at Kunitomo's residence.

42
00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.545
What? He committed suicide?

43
00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:32.545
He might have been murdered.

44
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:36.545
After that, it seems like someone also killed the owner of the residence.

45
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:42.045
Well, I met the guy when the company president's family

46
00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:44.545
filed a missing person report.

47
00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:46.245
Missing person report?

48
00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:49.945
Yes. The president suddenly disappeared!

49
00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:53.245
He still hasn't returned after 13 years.

50
00:03:53.245 --> 00:03:55.345
13 years?

51
00:03:56.345 --> 00:04:00.545
It was the end of September 13 years ago.

52
00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:03.345
It was on mother's birthday.

53
00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:06.745
Which means that 13 years ago on September 26th,

54
00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:09.045
the president disappeared?

55
00:04:09.045 --> 00:04:12.445
If I'm not mistaken, the ship sunk at Suruga Bay

56
00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:15.045
13 years ago on September 29th.

57
00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:16.445
3 days before...

58
00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:20.145
And that Sekiguchi stepped in to take his place.

59
00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:21.445
Inspector!

60
00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:22.845
Let's go for a few drinks after work.

61
00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:24.845
Okay, but let's split the bill!

62
00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:27.345
Hey, why don't you treat him once in a while?

63
00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:29.545
You're so stingy.

64
00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:32.945
Call me an economical person! See you!

65
00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:38.645
Stingy people living here must also have some peculiar habits or symptoms.

66
00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:42.245
You all look tired so why don't all of you get some rest, Mr. Mouri?

67
00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:43.445
Yes, I think we'll do that.

68
00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:44.945
Hey, before you go to sleep,

69
00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:47.845
let's check up on the people in their bedrooms.

70
00:04:47.845 --> 00:04:50.045
Let's check if the habits and symptoms they were talking about

71
00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:52.445
are real or not!

72
00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.345
You want to know why I have belonephobia?

73
00:04:57.345 --> 00:05:00.345
When I was a child, I took my mother's sewing box,

74
00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:03.845
it fell and a needle poked onto my forehead.

75
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.945
That must have hurt.

76
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.045
Huh?

77
00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:10.545
Is that why the calendar is stuck on the wall with tape?

78
00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.745
Yes.

79
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.845
There are some marks on the calendar.

80
00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:21.445
It's the birthdays of myself, my daughter, Mr. Akatsuka and Mr. Watabiki.

81
00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:25.845
My husband, Mr. Watabiki's father, and Mr. Akatsugi's wife

82
00:05:25.845 --> 00:05:29.345
who died in the ship accident were all classmates from grade school

83
00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:33.345
and we always celebrated our birthdays together.

84
00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:39.045
Before Mr. Watabiki's mother passed away, there were eight marks.

85
00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:40.445
It has become half of that now.

86
00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.445
If you want to know about my fear for heights,

87
00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:49.545
you'd better ask Mr. Akatsuka and Mr. Watabiki.

88
00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:53.245
You fell from a high place because of them?

89
00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:54.645
It's the opposite!

90
00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:56.545
When I was in 4th grade,

91
00:05:56.545 --> 00:06:00.245
when I fell from a tree, Watabiki saved me from the fall.

92
00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:02.045
And that time, the left hand...

93
00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:03.945
Then you must have been hurt real bad?

94
00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:05.345
No.

95
00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:07.645
Actually, it was Watabiki who got hurt.

96
00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:08.745
A year or two ago,

97
00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:12.745
I had completely forgotten until I saw the scar on his hand.

98
00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:15.845
He's obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves.

99
00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:23.545
I always thought it was his younger brother that saved me.

100
00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:26.545
The room is so clean.

101
00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:29.945
Of course! Chefs are supposed to be clean.

102
00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:30.945
I guess that's right.

103
00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:34.045
Hey! Don't come into girl's room without permission!

104
00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:35.045
Excuse me!

105
00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:39.645
This is the scar from back then.

106
00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:40.745
So what's the problem?

107
00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:44.045
You wear gloves inside your room, too.

108
00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:48.945
Yes. Except during bath time and when I had my fingerprints taken.

109
00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:52.945
And I also take them off when I drive and write.

110
00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:57.145
These are the gloves your younger brother used.

111
00:06:57.145 --> 00:07:01.145
But my brother used them when he was a kid.

112
00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:03.745
I don't see the older brother's gloves.

113
00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:06.945
Unlike my younger brother, I am not a sportsman.

114
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.445
Really?

115
00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:10.745
Huh?

116
00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:13.645
Your calendar also has a lot of marks.

117
00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:14.845
Yes.

118
00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:18.645
I once forgot my master's business.

119
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:21.845
Ever since then, I write things down.

120
00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:26.445
What? How did I became a perfectionist?

121
00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.845
Do I need to have a reason?

122
00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:30.245
You're absolutely right.

123
00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:33.545
It seems like your tidiness is for real.

124
00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:36.645
Everything in this room is straight and tidy.

125
00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:39.345
I can't settle down until I do so.

126
00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:42.245
Hey, is there someone who is just the opposite?

127
00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:44.345
Not really sloppy, but...

128
00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:46.745
Shigeko seems to be a little sloppy.

129
00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:51.845
The way she piles the plates up is always three millimetres off.

130
00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:56.245
Watabiki and Namika are always precise.

131
00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:57.645
What's this?

132
00:07:57.645 --> 00:07:59.845
Is this compass yours?

133
00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.045
Yes, I like to hike to the mountains.

134
00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:06.545
Hey, did you notice the letters engraved in Mr. Sekiguchi's watch?

135
00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:07.645
What?

136
00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:10.545
Right, wasn't it "E" and "N"?

137
00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:13.445
But isn't it weird? If it's the same as this compass,

138
00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:15.745
the position of the "N" and "E" was wrong, wasn't it?

139
00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:18.145
I wonder why?

140
00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:19.845
I don't know!

141
00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.945
Well, we went around the four rooms.

142
00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:25.745
We didn't find anything suspicious, did we?

143
00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:29.145
This kid just took us for a ride!

144
00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:33.845
Well, let's continue with the investigation after a little rest.

145
00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:35.245
Yes, let's do that.

146
00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:38.545
I wonder what it is. Something's not right.

147
00:08:38.545 --> 00:08:40.745
I feel like I must've overlooked something.

148
00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:43.745
It doesn't feel right. What is it?

149
00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:45.345
Hey, Conan.

150
00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:48.345
I bought you new pyjamas, do you want to wear it tonight?

151
00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:50.345
It's a matching outfit with mine.

152
00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:52.045
Huh?

153
00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:53.145
Matching outfit?

154
00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:58.945
I see. I must have overlooked this possibility.

155
00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:03.745
If that is the truth, the factitive method of Sekiguchi's murder,

156
00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:06.845
the method used to go through the fingerprint identification machine,

157
00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:09.145
the mystery of the killer's disappearance from the third floor,

158
00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:11.945
the reason why the master was surprised enough to have a fit,

159
00:09:11.945 --> 00:09:14.245
this will explain it all!

160
00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:16.745
-Well done. -Hey!

161
00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:19.945
Mr. Kogoro asked to have the four people and the wife

162
00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:21.845
to assemble on the third floor.

163
00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:25.345
What? Does Mr. Mouri know who the culprit is?

164
00:09:25.345 --> 00:09:27.245
Yes, I think so.

165
00:09:27.245 --> 00:09:28.745
He said the culprit is still here,

166
00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:30.845
so please don't let him escape.

167
00:09:30.845 --> 00:09:34.245
That's great! He's going to start the deduction show!

168
00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:37.345
Not right now, but in about three hours later.

169
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:39.145
What? Three hours later?

170
00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.445
Yes, of course.

171
00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:45.545
Only if Inspector Yokomizo listens and does what he says.

172
00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:49.145
Yes, certainly.

173
00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:57.967
What is it? It's so early in the morning.

174
00:09:57.967 --> 00:10:03.367
Let me explain the truth of the two murders that took place here.

175
00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:07.967
And that the culprit is among you.

176
00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:11.867
First of all, the murder of Mr. Sekiguchi which is the first case.

177
00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:16.067
But didn't you say that it was an outsiders doing?

178
00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:17.067
Yes, that's right.

179
00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:18.067
That's true.

180
00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:22.667
Namika who is afraid of heights couldn't have hung anybody

181
00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:24.367
on the third floor's veranda.

182
00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:26.767
Shigeko who has belonephobia

183
00:10:26.767 --> 00:10:29.667
would have avoided places where sharp points such as the iron fencing.

184
00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:31.867
The words that were written on the card

185
00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:34.267
that the culprit is thought to have slipped into Sekiguchi's pocket.

186
00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.067
The lettering was slanted.

187
00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:40.367
A tidy and perfectionist Akatsuka would not have done that.

188
00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:44.367
At the time of the crime, Watabiki and the master's wife

189
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:45.967
who went to the hospital with the master,

190
00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:47.867
could not have committed the crime.

191
00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.167
Then who did it?

192
00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:54.467
You're not really saying that someone among us is faking it, are you?

193
00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:58.467
No. Namika's room is clean,

194
00:10:58.467 --> 00:11:01.067
but the area around the window was not.

195
00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:02.767
This proves that you are afraid of heights

196
00:11:02.767 --> 00:11:05.067
because you cannot come close to the window.

197
00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:09.667
Shigeko who has belonephobia uses tape to hang her calendar.

198
00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:11.867
Even when we intruded Akatsuka's room unexpectedly,

199
00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:15.367
the things in the room were tidy.

200
00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:18.867
I think it is safe to say that no one is lying.

201
00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:22.567
Let's investigate the second crime.

202
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.567
A person enters this bedroom on the third floor

203
00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:27.167
by opening the door of the fingerprint identification machine

204
00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:28.167
and slips through.

205
00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.467
This person sets things up to cause the master to have a heart attack

206
00:11:30.467 --> 00:11:31.767
that results in death

207
00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:35.667
and disappears without leaving any traces of having run away.

208
00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:37.567
The plausible explanation here

209
00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:40.067
is the getaway rope tied to the veranda.

210
00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:42.367
The culprit notices Conan climbing up the rope,

211
00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:44.967
so the culprit withdrew from the room

212
00:11:44.967 --> 00:11:47.467
and hide behind the fingerprint identification machine door.

213
00:11:47.467 --> 00:11:50.567
And managed to blend in with us without anyone noticing it.

214
00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:52.267
This is possible.

215
00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:55.167
But wasn't that proven innocent

216
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:58.767
by the fingerprints on the medicine bottle and rope?

217
00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:01.467
That is probably the fingerprints of the accomplice.

218
00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:02.867
-Accomplice? -Accomplice?

219
00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:06.867
Yes, there are two culprits!

220
00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:12.667
Does that mean that someone amongst us brought someone suspicious with us?

221
00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:18.367
But the master said that he wasn't planning on meeting anyone today.

222
00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:19.667
After all,

223
00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:24.067
we all looked in every room on the third floor and we didn't find anyone!

224
00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:27.867
Well, no one suspicious turned up

225
00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:31.867
and there was no trace of escape from the veranda nor the window.

226
00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:33.867
Then where's the accomplice?

227
00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:35.267
Yes, so...

228
00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:38.067
I wanted to re-enact this with everyone

229
00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:40.167
and that is why I asked you all to come here.

230
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:43.567
I might have overlooked something.

231
00:12:43.567 --> 00:12:45.067
Okay, everyone!

232
00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:47.567
We are going to search the rooms one by one.

233
00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:51.767
Unlike then, I will enter the room last

234
00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:56.267
in order to watch if anyone makes a suspicious move.

235
00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:02.067
So would Watabiki play my role by entering first

236
00:13:02.067 --> 00:13:04.267
and inspecting the window and veranda?

237
00:13:04.267 --> 00:13:06.567
-Okay? -Sure!

238
00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:11.267
So let's start with the library next to the bedroom.

239
00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:14.967
And of course, if you see something or notice something,

240
00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:17.567
please let me know!

241
00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:21.267
You don't have to shout. I can hear you clearly.

242
00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:24.667
I'm sorry. I shout whenever I get excited.

243
00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:27.467
Mr. Watabiki, please go in.

244
00:13:27.467 --> 00:13:29.167
Yes.

245
00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:33.167
The window is locked.

246
00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:35.667
No one's on the veranda.

247
00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:37.767
May we also go in?

248
00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:39.267
Yes, of course!

249
00:13:39.267 --> 00:13:42.367
Do you think we'll find something out this way?

250
00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:44.267
Yes.

251
00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:46.167
Then, let's go to the next room.

252
00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:47.867
Everyone, please hurry.

253
00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:50.167
No one suspicious came to the hallway.

254
00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:51.667
Thank you, Conan!

255
00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:54.467
Darn it.

256
00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:56.567
Nothing turned up!

257
00:13:57.567 --> 00:14:01.367
So if we're done, I'd like to get back to work!

258
00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:04.667
Stop babbling and answer my questions.

259
00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.967
Are you really sure there was no one suspicious?

260
00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:10.067
Was someone there or not? Which is it?

261
00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:13.267
No one was there...

262
00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:18.067
No, there was someone there in the room that you just searched.

263
00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:21.267
I just told you that no one was there!

264
00:14:21.267 --> 00:14:25.267
Yes, there is. There's one more person behind Inspector Yokomizo.

265
00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:30.367
Twins...

266
00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:34.867
Yes. He's my brother who works for the Kanagawa Prefectural Police.

267
00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:36.167
Hi.

268
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.067
I'll be off then.

269
00:14:38.067 --> 00:14:41.567
Don't tell my boss that I was in on this investigation.

270
00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:43.267
Right. Thanks.

271
00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:45.967
But why is twin the answer?

272
00:14:45.967 --> 00:14:48.267
In other words, it's like this...

273
00:14:48.267 --> 00:14:52.467
When we were searching the room, the culprit stayed in the back,

274
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:55.967
making sure to do so when entering and leaving the room.

275
00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:57.767
He acted as though he was leaving the room

276
00:14:57.767 --> 00:14:59.767
right before the one the accomplice was in,

277
00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:01.967
but he stayed there in the room right before the accomplice was hiding.

278
00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.367
When Inspector Yokomizo finished searching the window

279
00:15:04.367 --> 00:15:07.367
and you guys were waiting in order to enter the room,

280
00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:12.067
the accomplice that was hiding behind the door joined everyone.

281
00:15:12.067 --> 00:15:15.467
If the accomplice is a twin wearing the same clothes,

282
00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:18.167
switching places like Inspector Yokomizo did

283
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.567
no one would have noticed

284
00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:23.567
nor would have been suspicious that somebody else was hiding.

285
00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:24.667
But...

286
00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:25.767
Where are they?

287
00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:27.867
There are no twins here!

288
00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:32.667
Right. When Shigeko mentioned the story about everyone's birthdays,

289
00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.167
something bothered me.

290
00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:37.967
20 years ago, there were Watabiki, his parents and his younger brother,

291
00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:41.567
Shigeko and her husband and Namika as well as Akatsuka and his wife.

292
00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:43.967
There were supposed to be a total of nine birthdays,

293
00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:45.867
but she said there were only eight.

294
00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:49.067
Which means someone had the same birthday.

295
00:15:49.067 --> 00:15:53.467
After hearing Namika fell off a tree when she was in fourth grade,

296
00:15:53.467 --> 00:15:55.167
I was convinced.

297
00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:59.967
She could just vaguely remember who saved her at that age

298
00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:03.967
is because there were two people that were alike.

299
00:16:03.967 --> 00:16:04.967
In other words,

300
00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:10.867
Watabiki, you conspired with your twin brother and committed this crime.

301
00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:12.167
What are you talking about?

302
00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:15.767
His brother died in that accident 13 years ago!

303
00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:18.167
What if he didn't die in that accident?

304
00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:19.267
What?

305
00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:23.467
What if he swam to shore and survived?

306
00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:27.067
To prove that, there is a scar on the palm of his left hand,

307
00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:30.967
which he got when he saved Namika from her fall.

308
00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:32.867
When he drove us here,

309
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:37.667
there was no scar on his left hand.

310
00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:41.567
The mark at the head of the words on the calendar in his room

311
00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:43.867
were different depending on the date.

312
00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:47.567
They probably switched places once in a while,

313
00:16:47.567 --> 00:16:54.067
noting everything down and by using the same organizer,

314
00:16:54.067 --> 00:16:56.767
they could become one and the same person.

315
00:16:56.767 --> 00:16:58.167
They did it in preparation for today.

316
00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:01.567
In order to murder Mr. Sekiguchi and the master!

317
00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:05.167
The younger brother took the two of them to the hospital

318
00:17:05.167 --> 00:17:06.567
to establish an alibi.

319
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.267
After that, the older brother who was hiding in the mansion

320
00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:12.367
enters the third floor by making Sekiguchi open the door.

321
00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:17.467
He choked Sekiguchi and hung him from the veranda railing.

322
00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:21.467
And after a few hours, he goes to the third floor again

323
00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:24.367
and murdered the master.

324
00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:28.067
But master said he wasn't going to meet anyone.

325
00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:30.867
The master will meet him

326
00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:34.467
especially if he was with the master when Sekiguchi was killed.

327
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:38.067
Since he would be the most unsuspicious person.

328
00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:41.067
The master must have been surprised.

329
00:17:41.067 --> 00:17:44.267
A man wearing the same clothes with the same face appears.

330
00:17:44.267 --> 00:17:46.167
Furthermore, that is the same person who supposedly

331
00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:49.367
was said to have died 13 years ago.

332
00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:51.567
You deliberately left your younger brother's fingerprints

333
00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:53.867
on the medicine bottle and rope

334
00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:56.967
to make us believe it was of an unknown person is the culprit.

335
00:17:56.967 --> 00:17:58.767
This is to exclude the people inside the premise

336
00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:01.467
from the suspect list.

337
00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:03.767
But where is the other one?

338
00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:06.067
He didn't turn up in the search, right?

339
00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:10.367
That is why I asked Mr. Watabiki to search the window

340
00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:13.867
and gave you instructions in a loud voice.

341
00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:18.267
So that the accomplice who is hiding on the third floor can hear.

342
00:18:18.267 --> 00:18:20.867
I dropped him hints telling him that he'll be safe on the veranda!

343
00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:26.367
The police has surrounded the premise!

344
00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:28.567
Please bring him in.

345
00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:30.767
That won't be necessary.

346
00:18:30.767 --> 00:18:32.467
Brother.

347
00:18:32.467 --> 00:18:35.367
-Then you will admit to the crimes? -Yes.

348
00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:38.567
Wait a minute! If you're alive...

349
00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:39.867
What about my father?

350
00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:40.867
What about my wife?

351
00:18:40.867 --> 00:18:43.167
They probably died

352
00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:45.167
because they were abandoned by you-know-who.

353
00:18:46.867 --> 00:18:47.967
What is it?

354
00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:51.467
What happened 13 years ago?

355
00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:55.467
Something suddenly went wrong with the ship while cruising,

356
00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:58.167
so I dived to check it out.

357
00:18:58.167 --> 00:19:02.667
Someone's bag was tangled in the screw and helm.

358
00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:04.467
And inside it was somebody's hand.

359
00:19:04.467 --> 00:19:06.067
A human hand?

360
00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:09.567
It was most probably the hand of the missing former president

361
00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:12.067
of Sekiguchi's company who disappeared 13 years ago.

362
00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:16.867
He suddenly participated in the cruise to dump the body into the sea.

363
00:19:16.867 --> 00:19:21.367
In other words, the fifth soul written on the first card

364
00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:24.267
was referred to him.

365
00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:27.267
Did you know that he was going to dump the dead body?

366
00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:29.467
No, I didn't know!

367
00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:32.167
When I told everyone on the ship,

368
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:37.567
Sekiguchi suddenly shoved father away and speed the ship up.

369
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:40.067
Speeding without having control of the helm,

370
00:19:40.067 --> 00:19:43.767
the ship turned over and everyone was tossed into the sea.

371
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:46.967
Only the master and his wife escaped

372
00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:49.967
with the only rubber raft that had air in it.

373
00:19:49.967 --> 00:19:53.467
No! I was going to return to call for help.

374
00:19:53.467 --> 00:19:55.167
But Sekiguchi...

375
00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:57.267
They won't survive anyway!

376
00:19:57.267 --> 00:19:58.967
Just keep quiet about this,

377
00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:01.867
both of you are also an accomplice and abandoned them!

378
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.667
That's what he told me.

379
00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:06.767
We were all holding on to a small float,

380
00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:09.767
but thought that we would all die like this.

381
00:20:09.767 --> 00:20:11.667
So the person with the most physical strength, me,

382
00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:13.667
went to call for help.

383
00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:15.967
But I felt consciousness slipping away.

384
00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:19.767
When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed

385
00:20:19.767 --> 00:20:22.067
and I lost my memory.

386
00:20:22.067 --> 00:20:24.567
I sneaked out of the hospital and wandered around.

387
00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:26.167
Then in summer two years ago,

388
00:20:26.167 --> 00:20:27.967
I coincidently met my brother

389
00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:30.867
and at the same time, my memory came back to me.

390
00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:32.967
I met my brother on the day

391
00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:37.767
after I almost had a car accident with the master's car.

392
00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:39.667
The accident was my fault,

393
00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:42.467
but master was the one who kept on apologizing,

394
00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:45.167
so I thought it a little weird.

395
00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:49.967
That night, when I heard my brother's tale, I understood why.

396
00:20:49.967 --> 00:20:52.967
Then the master's nightmare and the car accident

397
00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:55.067
on the 4th of Butsumetsu was a coincidence?

398
00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:56.167
Yes.

399
00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:59.967
That's where we got the idea of taking revenge.

400
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:04.167
There was no evidence left for the police anyway.

401
00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:06.467
But if we can find the sunken ship...

402
00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:07.567
That's impossible!

403
00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:09.767
It actually sank within the Suruga Bay,

404
00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:13.267
but he told the police it sank way out at sea.

405
00:21:13.267 --> 00:21:15.667
34 degrees north latitude 45 minutes,

406
00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:17.767
138 degrees east longitude 30 minutes.

407
00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:23.367
Don't you guys remember? The "N" and "E" engraved on Mr. Sekiguchi's watch.

408
00:21:23.367 --> 00:21:25.567
"N" is north latitude 45 minutes,

409
00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:27.867
"E" is east longitude 30 minutes!

410
00:21:27.867 --> 00:21:28.867
If it's within Suruga Bay,

411
00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:30.867
then it's approximately 34 degrees north latitude

412
00:21:30.867 --> 00:21:32.667
and 138 degrees east longitude.

413
00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:36.567
That's probably where the ship sank.

414
00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:38.667
So that's what it means.

415
00:21:38.667 --> 00:21:41.067
But why on the 4th, the unlucky day?

416
00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:44.867
The ship accident was on September 29, a lucky day.

417
00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:48.367
That's because 13 years ago this day,

418
00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:50.567
October 4th was Butsumetsu.

419
00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:52.467
It was when the master went to the police

420
00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:54.967
to ask them to stop the investigation.

421
00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:24.067
After that, although the tide drifted it a little,

422
00:23:24.067 --> 00:23:26.567
the ship was somehow found

423
00:23:26.567 --> 00:23:30.267
with the bag in question still tangled in the screw.

424
00:23:30.267 --> 00:23:31.567
Talking about a problem,

425
00:23:31.567 --> 00:23:34.567
ever since that day, there's a problem that's been on my mind.

426
00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:36.267
Hey, Conan!

427
00:23:36.267 --> 00:23:38.767
Let's at least wear it once and take a picture!

428
00:23:39.767 --> 00:23:41.667
It's cute!

429
00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:44.367
A junior in high school wearing stuffed animal pyjamas.

430
00:23:44.367 --> 00:23:45.467
What's more, it's a panda.

431
00:23:46.367 --> 00:23:50.967
"Next Episode"

432
00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:53.967
I felt someone's eye on me.

433
00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:55.167
Maybe it's my imagination.

434
00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:57.867
Grenier's skylight window.

435
00:23:57.867 --> 00:23:59.667
Camera?

436
00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:01.867
Why? The Investigation Firm?

437
00:24:01.867 --> 00:24:04.267
Are Pops being photographed?

438
00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:06.267
Could it be the Black Organization?

439
00:24:06.267 --> 00:24:07.567
Oh, no.

440
00:24:08.967 --> 00:24:10.367
Oh, no! Oh, no!

441
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:16.367
Next Conan, "The Grenier House on Beikacho"

442
00:24:17.135 --> 00:24:19.235
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:21.435
"Nameplate"

444
00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:23.035
In the next episode, those two who we haven't seen in a while...

445
00:24:23.035 --> 00:24:26.235
-Those two? -The surprise is for next week!
