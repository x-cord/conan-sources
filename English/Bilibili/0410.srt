1
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.840
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.640
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.240
There's not much time left for The Youth Detective Squad!

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.740
Curtain call the case.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540
But make it in time for the curtains rising on stage.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.940
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:58.925
Tamanosuke Ito's popular traveling Theatre Troupe

10
00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.625
came to our town to perform a play.

11
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:05.225
"Taketori Story" -The show this time is "Taketori Story".

12
00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.825
However, the person who plays the main character Princess Kaguya,

13
00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.125
Ms. Renge Kataoka, was kidnapped.

14
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:13.625
Once the police starts their investigation,

15
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:17.925
I realize that this is a false kidnapping done by Ms. Renge herself.

16
00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.525
However, Ms. Renge wasn't where she was supposedly held.

17
00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.925
Somehow, she was really kidnapped.

18
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.725
The case started to move on...

19
00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:34.925
And the curtain of the play has also gone up.

20
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:44.525
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 2)"

21
00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:59.125
Once upon a time, there was an old man who harvests bamboo.

22
00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.425
What's going on? The curtain is up...

23
00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:04.725
There is no Princess Kaguya.

24
00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.525
Is it all right?

25
00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.225
Don't tell me that... Director!

26
00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:16.325
You really...

27
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:18.525
You really are going to put her on stage!

28
00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.925
We're talking about the leading role, Princess Kaguya!

29
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.625
"Yoichi Azuma (28)" -Her lines are really long, you know!

30
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.725
"Kantaro Sawamura (23)" -True...

31
00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:27.025
Don't worry.

32
00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:28.325
I changed the script.

33
00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:30.725
Everyone, hurry and memorize it!

34
00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:33.725
"Mataroku Onoue (35)"

35
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:35.025
I changed it so that Megumi,

36
00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:37.025
who is Kaguya as a child, has more parts,

37
00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.225
and shortened the adult part, as well as.

38
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.425
The stage direction.

39
00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:43.325
With the positioning of Kaguya and the lighting,

40
00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:45.825
we will try not to show her face.

41
00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.525
"Tamanosuke Ito (17)" -Except for the climax

42
00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:49.725
where Kaguya returns to the moon,

43
00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:52.125
we will need to show her face...

44
00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.025
I'm telling you, it won't work...

45
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.625
Life is what the traveling theater is all about.

46
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.725
"Kikuno Ichimura (40)" -There are times when it pours.

47
00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:02.525
"Hikoemon Bando (50)" -Tough times are indeed

48
00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:04.625
when we should all come together,

49
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.725
because doing so will make for a great performance.

50
00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:07.725
Words of wisdom by the old man,

51
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:09.825
I mean, the late director.

52
00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:14.025
Let's have faith that Renge will return and do our best.

53
00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:15.225
No, but...

54
00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:16.825
Please let me try!

55
00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:17.825
Ran...

56
00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:20.525
Everyone is looking forward to the show.

57
00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.325
Cancelling is out of the question.

58
00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:26.025
Let me do it! Please!

59
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.425
Ran.

60
00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:33.025
All right, let's do it, if you say so.

61
00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:35.225
Yeah, if you say so.

62
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:36.825
That's true...

63
00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:38.525
Thank you!

64
00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:41.725
Thank you.

65
00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.425
Thanks, everyone!

66
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:48.425
Hey, Mr. Tamanosuke, how long into the show is the climax?

67
00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:49.825
Well...

68
00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:52.425
The whole show is approximately two hours so...

69
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.225
That would be just around an hour and a half.

70
00:04:55.225 --> 00:05:00.525
That means that we'll have to find Ms. Renge by then, right?

71
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:03.025
You must have some clue, little one?

72
00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:05.025
What? Yeah...

73
00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:06.125
Right on!

74
00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.725
-What? -Please leave it to us!

75
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.225
The Youth Detective Squad, in action!

76
00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:12.525
-Yeah! -Yeah!

77
00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:16.425
Hey... I never ask for help from you guys...

78
00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:17.825
Then I'm coming with you.

79
00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.225
Mr. Tamanosuke.

80
00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:24.925
My part for The Emperor is about half into the play, an hour.

81
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:27.625
I'll look for Renge until then too.

82
00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:28.725
Director...

83
00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:31.825
The case is in progress too...

84
00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.825
"Shuichi Ohnuki (38)"

85
00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:39.125
Can you hear me, officers?

86
00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:44.725
I'm almost at the designated parking lot.

87
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:03.125
He received some kind of an envelope.

88
00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:08.625
It says to switch cars to the one written on the memo.

89
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:09.725
The number is...

90
00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:15.025
It's this car!

91
00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:41.025
Officer, this is from a cell phone.

92
00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:42.125
I'll answer it.

93
00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:45.525
Hello?

94
00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:49.025
Yes...

95
00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:50.325
I understand.

96
00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:54.525
I was told to go north of Takayama street.

97
00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:56.025
I will obey their instructions.

98
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:14.525
This child possesses beauty that does not exist in this world,

99
00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:17.125
and there are no dark places within the house she resides,

100
00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:18.925
for it is filled with light.

101
00:07:25.325 --> 00:07:27.725
It's almost time, Ms. Ran.

102
00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:32.425
Calm down...

103
00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:39.425
This place is where Ms. Renge was confined, right?

104
00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:43.025
Well, that was actually a false alarm.

105
00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:50.925
Which means whoever helped with Renge's false kidnapping

106
00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:53.425
is the real kidnapper.

107
00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:55.525
Is that right, little one?

108
00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:58.425
Right, that's what I think.

109
00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:00.325
No doubt about it.

110
00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:08.125
The problem is who is that person?

111
00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.925
But there aren't many people

112
00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:15.425
for a young woman can easily ask to do this.

113
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.125
What's up, Conan?

114
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.925
Do you see something?

115
00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:25.525
Wait a minute.

116
00:08:25.525 --> 00:08:28.725
What is it? It's just a construction site?

117
00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:31.325
Hey! Isn't that where...

118
00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.125
Yeah, right! You're right!

119
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:35.325
What?

120
00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:36.325
What's going on?

121
00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:39.125
What are you talking about?

122
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:41.125
But, back then...

123
00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:54.525
What? No, but...

124
00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:57.125
Yes.

125
00:08:58.225 --> 00:08:59.725
Yes.

126
00:08:59.725 --> 00:09:01.125
I understand.

127
00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:06.725
What? Inspector!

128
00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:07.825
They got away!

129
00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:08.825
Don't let him get away!

130
00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:10.325
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

131
00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.125
Stop!

132
00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.425
Make a right turn there, Inspector!

133
00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:29.925
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

134
00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:39.525
Mr. Ohnuki!

135
00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.525
Are... Are you okay?

136
00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:42.725
Come on!

137
00:09:45.725 --> 00:09:48.025
What happened?

138
00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:49.125
I...

139
00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:51.725
I was told on the cell phone to shake off the police

140
00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:54.325
and come in here...

141
00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:57.825
And when I stopped the car suddenly out of nowhere...

142
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:13.525
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:15.325
Officer Takagi, emergency deployment at the double!

144
00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:17.025
Yes, sir!

145
00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:19.225
And what about the hostage!

146
00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:21.825
The person said, "We'll let her go as soon as her safety is confirmed."

147
00:10:21.825 --> 00:10:23.525
"So tell them to wait until then"...

148
00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:25.925
Darn it! The person is making this some kind of joke...

149
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.725
Oh, Officer Takagi?

150
00:10:30.725 --> 00:10:35.425
There's something Pops wanted you to check out...

151
00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.225
Sorry, there's no time for that!

152
00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:39.725
What? What do you mean?

153
00:10:41.425 --> 00:10:43.725
And the play kept on rolling...

154
00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:48.225
Kaguya tells the Prince Ishizukuri

155
00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:51.025
to bring the holy stone bowl of the Buddha.

156
00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:55.725
To the Prince Kuramochi, she tells him to bring the jeweled sprig.

157
00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:58.225
Finally, she tells Counselor Ohtomo no Miyuki

158
00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:01.125
to bring her a colored jewel from the neck of a dragon.

159
00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:02.925
Oh, I'm so nervous!

160
00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:06.825
Please hurry back, Ms. Renge, Tamanosuke!

161
00:11:48.447 --> 00:11:52.247
Yes, of course I wasn't looking behind me.

162
00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:01.347
Hey, you guys can't come in here!

163
00:12:01.347 --> 00:12:03.347
You're not allowed to cross the yellow line.

164
00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:04.847
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:07.647
So he's still hasn't been caught at inspection point?

166
00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:08.747
What?

167
00:12:08.747 --> 00:12:13.447
No, although we set it up in less than a minute.

168
00:12:13.447 --> 00:12:15.947
Hey! I told you not to go in there...

169
00:12:15.947 --> 00:12:17.447
Aren't there any witnesses?

170
00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:18.447
What?

171
00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:21.047
You are...

172
00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:23.247
Anyway, what about the witness?

173
00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:24.847
When he was attacked?

174
00:12:24.847 --> 00:12:26.447
What...

175
00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:28.647
No one saw anything?

176
00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:31.147
It was right after I got out of the car.

177
00:12:52.547 --> 00:12:53.947
Isn't that...

178
00:12:56.647 --> 00:12:57.847
Camera!

179
00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:04.947
Thank you for your cooperation!

180
00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:06.547
Do you see something, little one?

181
00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:07.547
Yeah.

182
00:13:09.447 --> 00:13:10.647
There's no doubt about it!

183
00:13:10.647 --> 00:13:12.647
What do you mean, Conan?

184
00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:15.047
Did you find a clue in the video?

185
00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:19.547
But with the camera there the scene is out of range.

186
00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:21.647
Yeah, but the kidnapper...

187
00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:22.747
Hey!

188
00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:25.647
That's hurt!

189
00:13:25.647 --> 00:13:27.147
That's enough!

190
00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:30.447
I'm sorry, I thought you...

191
00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:33.147
I figured that's what was going on.

192
00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:35.647
What? Where did he go?

193
00:13:39.847 --> 00:13:41.747
What? Did it come?

194
00:13:41.747 --> 00:13:42.847
Mr. Mouri?

195
00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:44.247
Officer Takagi.

196
00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:47.547
-Yes? -Bring everyone outside here.

197
00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:49.347
What? Yes.

198
00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:50.547
And...

199
00:13:50.547 --> 00:13:52.847
There's one more thing...

200
00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:53.947
Yes.

201
00:13:58.447 --> 00:14:00.847
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

202
00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:02.047
Officer Takagi.

203
00:14:02.047 --> 00:14:03.047
Yes.

204
00:14:03.047 --> 00:14:04.247
It's already on the screen.

205
00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:09.347
I asked them to forward this from the investigation headquarters.

206
00:14:09.347 --> 00:14:12.747
The problem is the chimney seen here on the screen.

207
00:14:12.747 --> 00:14:16.247
The fact is this was taken down four days ago.

208
00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:17.547
What?

209
00:14:17.547 --> 00:14:21.747
This public bath was taken down to be remodeled.

210
00:14:21.747 --> 00:14:26.747
In other words, this was not taken on the same day it was sent.

211
00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:28.747
Which means...

212
00:14:28.747 --> 00:14:31.347
As long as the image was set up to be forwarded,

213
00:14:31.347 --> 00:14:35.347
the kidnapper could've been on the receiving end too.

214
00:14:35.347 --> 00:14:37.947
In other words, what you're trying to say is...

215
00:14:37.947 --> 00:14:40.247
The kidnapper was among us!

216
00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:41.547
Officer Takagi.

217
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.047
Yes. I looked into it just like Mr. Mouri said.

218
00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:47.747
I checked on who was always on the receiving end of the image

219
00:14:47.747 --> 00:14:49.447
sent out by the kidnapper

220
00:14:49.447 --> 00:14:53.447
as well as the instructions by phone.

221
00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:00.747
Knock... Knock it out...

222
00:15:02.647 --> 00:15:07.047
And take a look at the recorded image of the security camera.

223
00:15:10.547 --> 00:15:14.847
Mr. Ohnuki, instructed to do so by the kidnapper,

224
00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:17.147
you tried to shake off the police.

225
00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:18.547
That's right.

226
00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:19.747
When was that?

227
00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:21.847
When...

228
00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:24.147
When I was stopped at the traffic light.

229
00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:27.447
I'm sure you officers heard the exchange too.

230
00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:31.147
But, we couldn't hear the kidnapper's voice.

231
00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:34.247
That's because it was a telephone call.

232
00:15:34.247 --> 00:15:38.047
That telephone call, did it really come in?

233
00:15:38.047 --> 00:15:40.547
What are you trying to say?

234
00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:46.447
Then why did the kidnapper take the cell phone with the ransom?

235
00:15:46.447 --> 00:15:48.947
That's...

236
00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:50.347
What?

237
00:15:50.347 --> 00:15:54.247
What? No, but...

238
00:15:54.247 --> 00:15:57.347
Yes...

239
00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:58.647
I understand.

240
00:16:00.347 --> 00:16:01.747
This is...

241
00:16:01.747 --> 00:16:05.447
As you can see, he is not using the phone.

242
00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:06.847
If we look at the cell phone,

243
00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:09.347
we can tell that there is no call log.

244
00:16:09.347 --> 00:16:12.147
That's why he didn't leave it behind.

245
00:16:12.147 --> 00:16:17.047
It is probably somewhere along with the ransom.

246
00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:20.947
If we search the area, we will soon have the results.

247
00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:25.747
But before that, we will need to rescue the hostage.

248
00:16:25.747 --> 00:16:27.247
What's this supposed to mean?

249
00:16:27.247 --> 00:16:29.647
The kidnapper himself should know.

250
00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:36.247
I don't know! I don't know a thing!

251
00:16:36.247 --> 00:16:37.847
Quit fooling, Ohnuki!

252
00:16:45.247 --> 00:16:46.647
Where's my daughter!

253
00:16:46.647 --> 00:16:48.247
Where's Renge!

254
00:16:48.247 --> 00:16:49.947
President...

255
00:16:49.947 --> 00:16:51.447
If something happens to my daughter,

256
00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:53.647
you won't get away with this!

257
00:16:53.647 --> 00:16:55.047
Just remember that!

258
00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:58.747
No! I just helped your daughter to do

259
00:16:58.747 --> 00:16:59.947
what she asked me to do...

260
00:16:59.947 --> 00:17:01.247
Helped?

261
00:17:02.747 --> 00:17:05.647
Right, in the beginning it was just an act.

262
00:17:05.647 --> 00:17:10.047
So, Ms. Renge can definitely say who helped her out.

263
00:17:10.047 --> 00:17:13.147
That is she can name the real kidnapper!

264
00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:18.147
So, the kidnapper can't just release her.

265
00:17:18.147 --> 00:17:21.147
Were you planning to kill her from the beginning?

266
00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:23.747
I don't know! I don't know a thing!

267
00:17:23.747 --> 00:17:26.647
I'm not going to talk anymore!

268
00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:29.147
Please stay here, Mr. Ohnuki.

269
00:17:33.647 --> 00:17:35.947
To protect the beloved Kaguya,

270
00:17:35.947 --> 00:17:40.247
The Emperor dispatched 2000 soldiers to the Taketori house...

271
00:17:41.747 --> 00:17:43.747
Don't worry.

272
00:17:43.747 --> 00:17:46.047
We are definitely going to find Ms. Renge!

273
00:17:46.047 --> 00:17:47.947
Leave it to us!

274
00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:55.947
The Youth Detective Squad to the rescue!

275
00:17:55.947 --> 00:17:57.247
-Yeah! -Yeah!

276
00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:05.047
Brother, hurry back!

277
00:18:05.047 --> 00:18:06.447
Just around here...

278
00:18:07.647 --> 00:18:08.947
I found it!

279
00:18:08.947 --> 00:18:09.947
This is it!

280
00:18:09.947 --> 00:18:11.847
What is it? Weed?

281
00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:15.447
It hasn't even rained, why is it so muddy?

282
00:18:15.447 --> 00:18:17.647
Maybe it grew near water?

283
00:18:17.647 --> 00:18:18.747
That's it!

284
00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:29.347
You're not leaving!

285
00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:33.147
Tamanosuke!

286
00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:39.647
I'm not going to return you to the moon, Kaguya!

287
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.247
Come on! No way! Is he serious?

288
00:18:45.247 --> 00:18:48.747
If I can be by your side, this country,

289
00:18:48.747 --> 00:18:50.447
my parents, I'm ready to give everything up!

290
00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:54.047
Mr. Tamanosuke's eyes...

291
00:18:54.047 --> 00:18:56.147
They are not looking at Princess Kaguya,

292
00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:58.847
and they are surely not looking at me.

293
00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:03.047
Have faith in me. I want you to stay with me.

294
00:19:03.047 --> 00:19:05.647
Kaguya, forever...

295
00:19:09.747 --> 00:19:12.747
The possibility of the kidnapper choosing a place far from here,

296
00:19:12.747 --> 00:19:15.447
knowing that it may be discovered, is low.

297
00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:18.547
If so, the place of confinement should be somewhere nearby again.

298
00:19:18.547 --> 00:19:19.847
And that place is probably...

299
00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:21.747
A place that has to do with water!

300
00:19:21.747 --> 00:19:23.647
-Okay! -Leave it to me!

301
00:19:25.847 --> 00:19:27.447
In the light of the night,

302
00:19:27.447 --> 00:19:29.747
brighter than the bright noon day,

303
00:19:29.747 --> 00:19:31.847
comes the messenger from the moon riding

304
00:19:31.847 --> 00:19:33.947
upon a cloud descending towards earth.

305
00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:53.347
I found her, Conan!

306
00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:06.447
Are you okay, Ms. Renge?

307
00:20:06.447 --> 00:20:07.847
The play...

308
00:20:07.847 --> 00:20:09.647
What happened to the play?

309
00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:12.747
Hurry, Kaguya! Come here!

310
00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:14.647
Let's go back to the moon together!

311
00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:23.447
Ends here...

312
00:20:24.647 --> 00:20:26.047
I can't watch anymore.

313
00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:32.747
Ms. Renge!

314
00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:33.847
Renge?

315
00:20:34.947 --> 00:20:36.547
No, I can't do this.

316
00:20:36.547 --> 00:20:40.347
Not after all the trouble I put you through...

317
00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:41.447
I can't!

318
00:20:42.747 --> 00:20:45.047
What are you talking about, Ms. Renge?

319
00:20:45.047 --> 00:20:46.647
That won't do...

320
00:20:46.647 --> 00:20:48.947
Neither for you nor Mr. Tamanosuke...

321
00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:52.647
I can understand.

322
00:20:57.347 --> 00:20:58.547
Ran...

323
00:20:59.747 --> 00:21:00.847
Ms. Renge!

324
00:21:19.047 --> 00:21:20.847
We will meet again.

325
00:21:20.847 --> 00:21:23.747
I believe in you. Kaguya.

326
00:21:23.747 --> 00:21:25.647
No, I mean Renge!

327
00:21:26.847 --> 00:21:28.047
Yes.

328
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:30.347
Yes!

329
00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:40.647
I hate to admit it...

330
00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:42.147
But it's so inspiring!

331
00:23:18.447 --> 00:23:21.347
After that, Secretary Ohnuki was arrested.

332
00:23:21.347 --> 00:23:23.147
And the ransom retrieved.

333
00:23:25.047 --> 00:23:29.147
Like Princess Kaguya, Ms. Renge, returns home,

334
00:23:29.147 --> 00:23:31.747
and after persuading her father,

335
00:23:31.747 --> 00:23:33.247
she returns to the troupe.

336
00:23:33.247 --> 00:23:35.547
Now, she travels around the country performing

337
00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.447
with Mr. Tamanosuke and the group.

338
00:23:42.347 --> 00:23:46.047
It was also a new start

339
00:23:46.047 --> 00:23:49.847
for both Mr. Tamanosuke and Ms. Renge.

340
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.847
"Next Episode" -Why didn't you take us with you?

341
00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:04.647
That's not fair!

342
00:24:04.647 --> 00:24:07.147
We wanted to see the fireworks too!

343
00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:11.247
What is this?

344
00:24:11.247 --> 00:24:13.547
Look at that!

345
00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:16.347
"Marumushi ni tent (Pill bug and tent)"

346
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:18.247
Please help me!

347
00:24:19.547 --> 00:24:22.847
Someone's been killed and we're in trouble too!

348
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 1)"

349
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.274
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:32.274 --> 00:24:34.574
"Down and across"

351
00:24:34.574 --> 00:24:36.974
I'm the star in the next episode bringing you a Cinderella story.

352
00:24:36.974 --> 00:24:39.274
-Please don't fight over me... -Thank you for your hard work!
