1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,130
The old man received a letter from
someone named Ichihara Taisei,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,700
asking him to determine why his
old friend committed suicide

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,180
by deciphering the code left
at the feet of the body.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,030
The old man and I gathered the number
of guests specified by the letter

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,010
and arrived at an abandoned church
deep in the mountains of Nagano.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,920
We learned that the client
Nichihara Taisei-san

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,600
was the man who committed
suicide in that church.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,430
At the instructions of presumably
the person who invited us here,

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,010
we searched the abandoned
church for additional codes.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,430
Here we are.

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,030
Hey, you.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,610
How long are you going to—

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,030
Hey!

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,320
What the hell is going on here?!

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,860

Always determining the one truth

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,350

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,050

Why is Wada bleeding on the ground?

Hey, Wada! Kohei!

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,790
Don't come any closer.

31
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,670
This is the scene of a murder.

32
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,970
M-Murder?

Amateurs messing around with the crime

Amateurs messing around with the crime
scene will surely cause problems later.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,410
Hold it right there!

47
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,610
I'm not going to sit here
quietly while you insult us.

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
Clean our your ear holes
and listen carefully.

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,250
The truth is, he's the great detective
who puts crying kids to sleep.

50
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,250
"Puts crying kids to sleep?"

51
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,400
He's Mori Kogoro,

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,760
also known as the Sleeping Kogoro.

53
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,990
What's Mori Kogoro doing here?

54
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,760
You said you came here because you received a
letter from Nichihara, who committed suicide.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,830
We were likely invited here by someone who
found Nichihara Taisei-san's suicide suspicious.

57
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,020
They asked us to solve the code and
uncover the truth behind his suicide.

58
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,780
It would seem that whoever they are,

59
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,700
they think you guys were
the cause of his suicide.

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,530
N-No way.

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,400
So if you don't want anybody else to die,

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
then let the professional handle it.

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,260
Now, now, Wakita-san and Amuro-kun.

64
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,350
I'm sure they're just panicking
because their friend was killed.

65
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's remain calm, notify the Nagano
police, and ask them for instructions.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,040
Yes, Master.

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,380
You're right.

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,230
They're beginning to resemble vice-shogun
Mito Komon and his samurai retainers.

Nagano Police HQ

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,360
Nagano Police HQ
What? Someone was killed?

71
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,700
What? Someone was killed?

72
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,190
What the hell are you doing?

73
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,360
I didn't kill him.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,530
What's your situation?

75
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,790
According to the license on the body,

76
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,290
the victim is Wada Kohei-san, 28 years old.

77
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:21,170
A crossbow was rigged to fire when
the bathroom cabinet was opened.

78
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,550
It hit Wada-san right in the head.

79
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,990
I don't understand.

80
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,430
Why was a crossbow set up in the bathroom?

81
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,490
It was a trap set by whoever invited us here.

82
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,320
In any case, we'll preserve the crime scene.

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,940
I'll fill you in on the details
when you come for us tomorrow.

84
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,760
Then take a video of the crime
scene and send it to us.

85
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,950
Wow, that's awful.

86
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,210
Right between the eyebrows.

87
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,910
He's a rather unlucky victim.

88
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,710
If the culprit knew this
man would open the cabinet,

89
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,650
it would've been possible
to aim for his forehead.

90
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,240
But didn't Mori-san say they drew lots
to determine who would search where?

91
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,810
That's why it's if the culprit knew.

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,180
Could you rewind the video a bit?

93
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,240
What? To here?

94
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,980
This blond man behind him.

95
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,610
I've seen him before somewhere...

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,510
The culprit who invited you all here

97
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,970
and killed Wada-san is
probably trying to get revenge

98
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,510
for Nichihara Taisei-san who committed
suicide here two months ago.

99
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,190
Seriously?

100
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,380
I knew it. And Wada was
killed, just like I expected.

101
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,900
Raito, hey.

102
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,270
You're being indiscreet.

103
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,650
Sorry.

104
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,380
Just like he expected?

105
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,750
So, who's the culprit?

106
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:17,660
We don't know if the culprit is one of
you or hiding in the abandoned church.

107
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,040
We don't even know if their revenge
is over after killing that man.

108
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,540
Y-You mean they're trying to kill us, too?

109
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,670
We won't be able to go to the bathroom alone.

110
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,400
So I have a suggestion.

111
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,180
Why don't we form pairs?

112
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,430
We can act in pairs at all
times with someone we trust.

113
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,160
Pairs. That's a good idea.

114
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,300
But I'm the only woman.

115
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,580
Then why don't you two form a pair?

116
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,480
You used to date a long time ago.

117
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,490
Yeah, but the person you pair
up with could be the culprit.

118
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,870
The culprit invited a detective here.

119
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,000
They wouldn't do anything to expose
themselves as the murderer, like killing their partner.

120
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,460
Then I'll pair up with Ikue. Is that okay?

121
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,500
Sure.

122
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,240
Then I'll pair up with Nishino, right?

123
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,720
Sure, no problem.

124
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,810
Then I'll pair up with Conan-kun.

125
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,510
Okay.

126
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,520
Then I'm with the master. Is that all right?

127
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
Sure.

128
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,440
We'll go to the bathroom first.

129
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,660
Don't do anything without
checking in with the others.

130
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,990
Hey, Amuro-san. Have you figured
out who the culprit is?

131
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,120
No.

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,380
Since we drew lots to determine
who would search this room,

133
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,510
for the time being, we can only
assume it was a coincidence

134
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,630
that Wada-san was killed in this bathroom.

135
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,930
It could be that there are other traps,

136
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,220
and the culprit intends to
kill everyone here at random,

137
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,020
and anyone could have set
up this crossbow beforehand.

138
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,140
But it struck Wada-san
here because he's tall.

139
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,790
If it had been Ikue-san, who's short,
then it wouldn't have hit her.

140
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,400
Exactly.

141
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,590
But there was nothing suspicious
about the way we drew lots.

142
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,160
Also, I have an odd question for you.

143
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,790
RUM...

144
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,760
You know who they are, don't you?

145
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,380
Where did you get that information?

146
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,420
Have you met them?

147
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,690
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,220
If I tell you I've met them,

149
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,820
then I assume you'll begin investigating
everyone associated with me.

150
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,960
And if I say I haven't,

151
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,430
then you'll be unnecessarily cautious around
anyone who approaches either me or you.

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,180
Yeah.

153
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,460
Either way, it doesn't benefit me.

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,500
I suppose all I can tell you
is that they're very impatient.

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,120
Impatient?

156
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,950
It's really starting to come down.

157
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,730
I'm not sure they'll be able
to come get us tomorrow.

158
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,230
That's not good. Our water is limited.

159
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,960
You've always drunk too much water.

160
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,510
Could I get something to drink?

161
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,490
Sure.

162
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,440
Did anyone just hear an odd noise?

163
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,600
Sounded like glass breaking.

164
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,750
It came from the building next
door that we were just in.

165
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
I-Is there someone hiding in there after all?

166
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,210
Someone go check. I won't
be able to sleep like this.

167
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,760
But we were told not to act on our own.

168
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,220
Then why don't we send one
pair to check things out?

169
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,640
If there's two of us, I'm sure we
can handle whatever's out there.

170
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,640
You're right.

171
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,020
I don't think that's a good idea.

172
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,170
Yeah.

173
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,780
This blizzard probably blew something
into one of the church's glass windows.

174
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,610
Maybe we should go check.

175
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,850
How will we decide which pair is going?

176
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,120
Rock-paper-scissors should be fine.

177
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,040
No way. I suck at rock-paper-scissors.

178
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,710
Ikue, you brought a dozen mint cases, right?

179
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,620
Could I get a few of those?

180
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,190
We'll use three of those
cases and empty two of them.

181
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,420
These two empty cases that
don't make noise are safe.

182
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,820
Choose the case that does
make noise, and you're out.

183
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,320
The pair that chooses the noisy case goes
to check things out. How's that sound?

184
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,700
Since I'm the one who suggested it, my
pair will take whichever case is leftover.

185
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,460
Go ahead.

186
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,530
Master, since you know which
one not to choose, go ahead.

187
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,500
You can count on me.

188
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,210
Hup.

189
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
Let's see...

190
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,780
It's empty.

191
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,730
I knew you could do it, Master!

192
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,330
Mine's empty, too.

193
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,090
I guess we'll go check things out, then.

194
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,270
I guess so.

195
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,040
We heard the sound of breaking glass, too.

196
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,960
You had someone go check on the situation?

197
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,210
Yeah. We tried to stop them.

198
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,880
Who was it?!

199
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,640
Who texted Kawasaki?!

200
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,940
Texted him?

201
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,510
Not me.

202
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,980
When he saw that text, his expression
changed and he headed to the bath.

203
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,010
Wasn't that Kawasaki's voice?

204
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,920
You said he headed to the bath, right?

205
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,430
K-Kawasaki-san.

206
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
Hey, hang in there.

207
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,810
Hey. Hey!

208
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,960
Hey!

209
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,620
Poison?

210
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,850
Judging by his breath, his must've
consumed a cyanide poison.

211
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,830
But the water in the bottle at his feet isn't
producing a oxidation-reduction reaction.

212
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,110
The poison wasn't in his water.

213
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,490
Then how?

214
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,660
It wasn't me.

215
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,780
It's that code again.

216
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,120
If this code was left here,

217
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,900
then that might mean these
murders aren't over yet.

218
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,890
Damn it.

219
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,870
My phone doesn't have service.

220
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:56,290
We can't get in touch with the Nagano
police when two people are dead.

221
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,450
This blizzard must have
knocked out a cell tower.

222
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,060
B-But why Kawasaki?

223
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,300
Was he really poisoned?

224
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,590
Yes.

225
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,940
Either someone forced
him to take the cyanide,

226
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,310
or else he was convinced to consume it.

227
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,630
Then there really is someone besides
us hiding in this abandoned church.

228
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,700
After all, there wasn't any poison in the
water in the bottle beside him, right?

229
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,280
Someone must've forced the
poison inside his mouth

230
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,580
and made him swallow it using that water.

231
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,580
Maybe.

232
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,280
Kawasaki was a clean-freak.

233
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,610
Even if the poison was mixed into something, he would've been too cautious to drink it.

234
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,430
He did drink constantly, though,
as long as it was water.

235
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,200
Just water?

236
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,970
He once collapsed from
dehydration during practice.

237
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,350
Since then, he started
drinking water all the time.

238
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,130
He'd chug some water after using the
bathroom, cleaning, or attending class.

239
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,200
It was practically a habit.

240
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,780
Yeah.

241
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,100
Yeah, but...

242
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,620
If the poison was forced into his
mouth and washed down with water,

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,310
then the water should have spilled from
the corners of his mouth or been spit out.

244
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,380
But the area around his mouth
and neck isn't wet at all.

245
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,750
Was he really forced to drink a poison?

246
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,880
If not, then he must've
been convinced to drink it

247
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,950
by one of you.

248
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,230
Come to think of it,

249
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:47,310
didn't you say the victim Kawasaki-san
received a text from someone on his phone?

250
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,130
Y-Yeah.

251
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,450
When he saw it, his expression
changed, and he ran towards the bath.

252
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,220
I don't know if he really
didn't want me to see the text

253
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,700
or if he didn't want me

254
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,780
to overhear the conversation he was
going to have with whoever texted him.

255
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,710
Then maybe we can figure something
out by examining his phone.

256
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,100
Indeed.

257
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,470
Since this phone seems to
use a fingerprint lock...

258
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,250
Excuse me.

259
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,870
We'll borrow the body's finger.

260
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,350
He certainly did receive a text earlier.

261
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,110
Let's see. What does it say?

262
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,900
"You promised you'd take that
secret to the grave, traitor..."

263
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,840
Does anyone know what secret
this is referring to?

264
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,540
D-Dunno.

265
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,460
I'm curious to know why he
called him a traitor, too.

266
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,740
I have no idea what any of that means.

267
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,090
What's the sender's address?

268
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,470
Couldn't we use that to determine
who sent that creepy message?

269
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,350
Then let's take a look
at everyone's addresses.

270
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,030
We'll compare them to the address
of whoever sent this creepy text.

271
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,110
Hey, what's going on here?

272
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,990
All three of your addresses are
different from the culprit's.

273
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,390
Then who sent the text?

274
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,250
If someone had multiple addresses,

275
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,370
they could delete the address
they used to text Kawasaki-san.

276
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,130
Or else someone secretly has a second phone,

277
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,630
or there really is another person hiding

278
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,490
somewhere in this abandoned church.

279
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,270
Then maybe we do have to solve them.

280
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,900
The ones we were first sent, the
one stuck to the chapel door,

281
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,280
the ones in the rooms we searched,

282
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
and the one we found next
to Kawasaki-san's body.

283
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,420
These four codes.

284
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:09,290
They do seem related to Nichihara
Taisei-san who committed suicide here.

285
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Was Nichihara-san your classmate, too?

286
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,390
Y-Yeah.

287
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,670
Then you must've had more in common, right?

288
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,480
For example, did you guys secretly get up to
any shady business together in high school?

289
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,050
No.

290
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,190
The only other thing we have in common is
that Wada who was killed first in the toilet

291
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,060
and Kawasaki who was
just poisoned in the bath

292
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,190
attended Shinano University with Fujide.

293
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,290
Shinano University is a prestigious school.

294
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,310
I suppose it is...

295
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,480
Huh?

296
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,950
There's something stuck to
the indentation on the phone.

297
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
You're right.

298
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,340
It's some kind of gel.

299
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,430
This smell...

300
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,120
It's honey.

301
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,560
What's it doing on this phone?

302
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,310
You two seem to be rather close friends.

303
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,690
Yeah, I guess so.

304
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:24,200
But we only run into each other occasionally
at Mori-sensei's detective agency.

305
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,950
You seem awfully close considering.

306
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,460
And the kid with the glasses
seems pretty smart.

307
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,220
He's just copying Mori-sensei's detective work.

308
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,720
It's just the shallow wit of a child.

309
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,720
Huh.

310
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,640
I'm excited to see how he turns out.

311
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,190
Still?

312
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,890
They still can't clear the tunnel
leading to that abandoned church?

313
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,750
Yeah.

314
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm having them prioritize, but still...

315
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,480
Damn.

316
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,170
I hope nothing terrible
is happening up there.

317
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,160
That blond man...

318
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,620
I believe I met him

319
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,190
while my brother Hiromitsu
was attending Toto University

320
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,670
and staying with relatives in Tokyo.

321
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,600
I was waiting for my brother in a café.

322
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,590
Yes,

323
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,570
the friend my brother brought with him was...

324
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,200
Brother.

325
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,070
This is my friend Furuya Rei-kun.

326
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,270
He wants to become a police
officer like you and me.

327
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,930
Rei... Zero?

328
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,460
Is he the one who sent me my brother's
phone with the hole in it?

329
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,420
Hello?

330
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,150
It's been a while, Yamato.

331
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,050
First Division Chief Kuroda?

332
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,550
Idiot, I'm not your section chief anymore.

333
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,920
Put Morofushi on the phone.

334
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,560
I've got a question for him.

335
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,700
For Komei?

336
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,340
What's wrong? Hurry up and put him on.
