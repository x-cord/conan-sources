1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.840
Found within Pop's wallet

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
was a receipt for a 50,000-yen necklace.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.940
It seemed to be a birthday present for Ran's mother,

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.440
Attorney Kisaki, who was born on October 10th.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.940
After learning of that, Ran displayed her tremendous lottery luck

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.840
and won tickets for a hotel stay.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.740
As a result, we ended up enjoying a fancy dinner in a seaside hotel,

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.540
but Pops didn't seem to plan to give her the present

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.140
and even got drunk and fell asleep.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.740
Attorney Kisaki who was upset went back to her room.

11
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.340
Just before midnight and the end of the birthday,

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.640
Ran tried to get Pops to deliver his present at any cost.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040
But soon after we barged into the room,

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.740
we discovered a murdered female body.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
That woman was Mrs. Akiho Kokubu, a client of Attorney Kisaki

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.940
who had a stalker problem and was in the process

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.540
"Akiho Kobuku (28), Client" -of settling the case out of court.

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.440
The body wasn't there when Attorney Kisaki returned to her room,

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.440
but it appeared out of nowhere while she was taking a shower.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.840
Looks like the culprit moved the bed

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.540
and hid under it along with the body.

22
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.340
Accompanied by Inspector Yokomizo,

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.440
we began questioning all of the hotel guests in connection to Akiho.

24
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.540
Brooding over passing seasons

25
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

26
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.540
Fulfill Ran's wish, Pops.

27
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.440
Make great deductions once in a while without going to sleep.

28
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:17.287
"The Worst Birthday (Part 2)"

32
00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:21.887
My wife was murdered?

33
00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:24.487
Who... Who did it? And why?

34
00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:27.287
We're currently investigating that.

35
00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:31.687
But why didn't you pick your wife up?

36
00:03:31.687 --> 00:03:33.987
"Takehiko Kokubu (30)" -I did call

37
00:03:33.987 --> 00:03:35.387
"Akiho's Husband" -and say I'd pick her up,

38
00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:38.687
but she bellowed that she wouldn't let me in even if I came over.

39
00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:41.087
What was the cause of your argument?

40
00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.887
Well, it was...

41
00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:44.887
Was it about this?

42
00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:48.987
It's a bunch of mini cars.

43
00:03:48.987 --> 00:03:51.287
I've loved cars since I was a kid,

44
00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:53.487
and lining them up helps me feel calm.

45
00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:57.087
But how could this have caused the fight?

46
00:03:57.087 --> 00:03:58.687
See.

47
00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:01.787
The side mirror was tossed onto the floor.

48
00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:05.787
A man who loves cars wouldn't do something this violent, right?

49
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.587
So your wife did this?

50
00:04:07.587 --> 00:04:10.887
Yeah. She told me to quit this childish and disgusting hobby

51
00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:12.387
and threw it.

52
00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:16.687
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

53
00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:22.787
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

54
00:04:22.787 --> 00:04:24.487
This Porsche.

55
00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:28.187
That woman was murdered?

56
00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:30.787
"Midori Hino (51)" -Well, I always figured...

57
00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:32.587
"Opposing Party In The Negotiation" -one of the foolish men she deceived

58
00:04:32.587 --> 00:04:36.287
would eventually kill her.

59
00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:40.287
On that note, it's my understanding that you called the victim.

60
00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:44.287
Yeah, I was calling the attorney to see

61
00:04:44.287 --> 00:04:47.387
if we could slightly change the time of our negotiation tomorrow.

62
00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.587
But I was shocked when that woman picked up the phone.

63
00:04:50.587 --> 00:04:54.087
Why did you wish to change the time?

64
00:04:54.087 --> 00:04:58.587
The golf appointment I have with a friend got moved up.

65
00:04:58.587 --> 00:05:01.387
So you plan to play golf soon after

66
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.287
your stalker son's settlement negotiations?

67
00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:05.887
There's another occupant in this room.

68
00:05:05.887 --> 00:05:07.187
What?

69
00:05:07.187 --> 00:05:11.187
There aren't lipstick marks on these cigarette butts.

70
00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.987
And the filter is still damp.

71
00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:17.787
It really is.

72
00:05:17.787 --> 00:05:19.387
Is that right?

73
00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:23.787
That's enough, Seiji!

74
00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:25.487
Get out here!

75
00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:30.687
"Seiji Hino (26), Hidori's Son" -So that's your stalker son?

76
00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:33.287
I told you that my son was only deceived.

77
00:05:33.287 --> 00:05:37.987
But you were instructed not to bring your son here, were you not?

78
00:05:37.987 --> 00:05:41.687
Well, he happened to be here

79
00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:44.387
because he'll be touring with his friends

80
00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:45.587
on their bikes tomorrow morning.

81
00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:49.387
Then show us that bike.

82
00:05:49.387 --> 00:05:50.587
Right here.

83
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:54.887
Look.

84
00:05:57.387 --> 00:05:59.387
A road bike?

85
00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:03.287
Incidentally, please tell us your whereabouts and what you did

86
00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.787
between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm.

87
00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:07.787
I was drinking with my mom.

88
00:06:07.787 --> 00:06:10.387
If you think we're lying, verify it yourself.

89
00:06:10.387 --> 00:06:13.487
We were at the hotel lounge on the top floor.

90
00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:21.187
It certainly appears that the mother and son

91
00:06:21.187 --> 00:06:23.487
were drinking together from 9.00 pm to 12.00 am.

92
00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:27.887
Yes, and it seems they both went to the restroom once.

93
00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.387
But it was at different times,

94
00:06:29.387 --> 00:06:32.687
so neither of them could have moved the bed.

95
00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:34.987
Well, it's getting late now.

96
00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:37.087
Let's continue the investigation at dawn.

97
00:06:37.087 --> 00:06:40.287
And where do you propose I should stay?

98
00:06:40.287 --> 00:06:42.887
Why don't you just stay in Mr. Mouri's room?

99
00:06:42.887 --> 00:06:44.687
You two are a married couple.

100
00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:46.687
I should note that we're living separately.

101
00:06:51.987 --> 00:06:54.187
Well, this was inevitable.

102
00:06:57.287 --> 00:06:59.687
There's something under the pillow.

103
00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:01.487
A present?

104
00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.587
Pops had it prepared after all, didn't he?

105
00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:07.587
But why didn't he give it to her yesterday, on October 10th?

106
00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:10.387
October 10th is my mom's birthday.

107
00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:15.287
I'll win the first place and give her the red ribbon as present!

108
00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:18.287
Don't tell me, Pops...

109
00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:21.687
You can't raise it then lower it.

110
00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:25.787
You have to lower the expectation, then raise it for a surprise.

111
00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:30.987
Raise and then lower. Lower and then raise?

112
00:07:37.287 --> 00:07:40.187
I see, so that's how it was.

113
00:07:40.187 --> 00:07:44.387
The culprit utilized that to move the bed easily.

114
00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:48.187
He did it single-handedly without anyone's help.

115
00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:50.287
"October 11th"

116
00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:52.587
Come on, please.

117
00:07:52.587 --> 00:07:55.887
We finally had the chance to stay at a hotel as a family,

118
00:07:55.887 --> 00:07:58.087
and this is a buffet.

119
00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:01.287
Why are you sitting at different tables?

120
00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:05.787
I was the one who sat down first.

121
00:08:05.787 --> 00:08:07.487
Isn't that moustached old man

122
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.187
the one who purposely sat at another table?

123
00:08:10.187 --> 00:08:14.587
It can't be helped. I have a lot on my mind.

124
00:08:14.587 --> 00:08:18.687
Such as how I'm going to prove the innocence of my wife

125
00:08:18.687 --> 00:08:21.387
who has become a murder suspect.

126
00:08:21.387 --> 00:08:22.787
Dad!

127
00:08:22.787 --> 00:08:25.487
Ran, don't be fooled.

128
00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.887
There's no telling what he's up to.

129
00:08:27.887 --> 00:08:29.687
Mom.

130
00:08:31.287 --> 00:08:33.787
He's checking the time.

131
00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:36.787
And he's checking the present as well.

132
00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:38.987
The moment is approaching.

133
00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:42.687
He's suddenly starting to be nice to the recipient.

134
00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:46.787
Well, I might as well put Pops to sleep

135
00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:49.387
and solve this case quickly.

136
00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:54.187
Darn it. At such a critical moment,

137
00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:58.687
why can't I find the key to solving this case at all?

138
00:08:58.687 --> 00:09:00.187
Darn it.

139
00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:04.687
Well, since this special day only comes once a year,

140
00:09:04.687 --> 00:09:07.787
I'll let Pops show off this time.

141
00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:12.487
It looks like a dish is brought out!

142
00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:14.787
-What? -How amazing.

143
00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:18.187
Something so heavy is being moved by a single person.

144
00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:20.187
It's not amazing.

145
00:09:20.187 --> 00:09:22.587
Since there are wheels on the bottom,

146
00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:24.687
it's easy for even a single person to move.

147
00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:27.787
Wheels on the bottom?

148
00:09:27.787 --> 00:09:30.287
Hey, what is this?

149
00:09:30.287 --> 00:09:32.887
This?

150
00:09:32.887 --> 00:09:35.987
Sausages! They look tasty!

151
00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:41.687
Oh, no! The ketchup!

152
00:09:41.687 --> 00:09:43.987
Conan! What are you doing?

153
00:09:43.987 --> 00:09:47.587
It's all right. I'll bring another one.

154
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.887
Gosh.

155
00:09:53.487 --> 00:09:58.287
What is this? The ketchup marks look like dots.

156
00:09:58.287 --> 00:10:01.787
Isn't it incredible that the marks are evenly spaced?

157
00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:05.387
Idiot! It's nothing incredible at all.

158
00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:09.687
The ketchup on the wheels will leave marks on the floor as it rolls,

159
00:10:09.687 --> 00:10:12.687
creating evenly spaced marks.

160
00:10:12.687 --> 00:10:14.187
Wait a second.

161
00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:17.087
Where have I seen this mark before?

162
00:10:27.987 --> 00:10:30.687
I see. So that's what happened!

163
00:10:30.687 --> 00:10:32.987
You finally got it.

164
00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:35.487
Ran! Call Yokomizo now!

165
00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:36.687
What?

166
00:10:36.687 --> 00:10:40.387
Have him gather the suspects to the room where the crime took place!

167
00:10:40.387 --> 00:10:42.087
Then, does that mean...

168
00:10:42.087 --> 00:10:44.587
Yeah, I've figured it out.

169
00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:46.887
The trick behind that locked room murder

170
00:10:46.887 --> 00:10:50.087
and the culprit who devised it!

171
00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:54.087
Kogoro Mouri's deduction show is about to begin!

172
00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:07.475
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.

173
00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:09.775
It took us a while to get here.

174
00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:13.075
Because by the time Ran contacted us,

175
00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:17.075
the three of them had already checked out of the hotel.

176
00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:19.575
So why did you call us here?

177
00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:22.875
I thought there wasn't anything left to talk about.

178
00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:27.675
I bet they're still suspecting us.

179
00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:31.275
What is this about? Don't we have an alibi

180
00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:35.175
from 10:00 to 11:00 pm, the supposed time of the crime?

181
00:11:35.175 --> 00:11:38.675
My son and I were drinking in the hotel lounge!

182
00:11:38.675 --> 00:11:42.175
But it seems you both left to use the restroom once.

183
00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:46.175
We went separately! And it was only for about 10 minutes.

184
00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:52.075
Besides, the corpse was in the room where that attorney stayed.

185
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:55.575
When the attorney came back at 11:00 pm,

186
00:11:55.575 --> 00:11:57.975
the woman's body wasn't there.

187
00:11:57.975 --> 00:12:00.575
The body was discovered around midnight

188
00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:06.275
after she took a shower and let Detective Mouri enter the room.

189
00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:09.475
If that's the case, isn't this a locked room murder?

190
00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:10.975
That's true.

191
00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:13.175
Since the hotel rooms are auto-locked,

192
00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:15.475
you can't get in without a keycard.

193
00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:17.775
If my wife was in the room,

194
00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:20.175
she could have opened the door for me.

195
00:12:20.175 --> 00:12:23.375
But when you returned to the room, my wife wasn't there, right?

196
00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.375
Yes.

197
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:27.975
No, she was already in the room.

198
00:12:27.975 --> 00:12:30.675
I mean your wife. -What?

199
00:12:30.675 --> 00:12:34.675
She was already killed and hidden under the bed.

200
00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:37.475
-What? -Under the bed?

201
00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:39.075
It can't be.

202
00:12:39.075 --> 00:12:43.775
And then the culprit moved the bed when Eri was showering,

203
00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:47.775
disclosed the body, and fled from this room.

204
00:12:47.775 --> 00:12:49.675
Moved the bed?

205
00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:51.175
But how?

206
00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:53.575
Please wait a minute.

207
00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:54.975
Is this all right?

208
00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.075
You're not doing what you usually do.

209
00:12:57.075 --> 00:13:00.275
-Usual? -I mean this.

210
00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.275
Just like that.

211
00:13:05.275 --> 00:13:06.775
What on earth was that?

212
00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:08.575
Hey!

213
00:13:08.575 --> 00:13:11.875
Can you tell us how the bed was moved?

214
00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.575
That's right.

215
00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:18.075
Before I returned to the room, if the culprit killed Akiho,

216
00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:21.075
concealed the body under the moved bed,

217
00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:23.775
and then hid himself next to the body,

218
00:13:23.775 --> 00:13:27.675
he could've made me not notice them when I came in.

219
00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:30.575
And while I was showering, it's possible

220
00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:34.275
that he moved the bed back to reveal the body

221
00:13:34.275 --> 00:13:37.775
and snuck out of the room.

222
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:42.475
It's a herculean task for a single person to slide a bed that heavy

223
00:13:42.475 --> 00:13:45.075
without leaving drag marks on the carpet.

224
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.675
Even if Akiho who was sleeping in my room

225
00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:51.375
was killed by her husband, Takehiko,

226
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:54.075
he would have been by himself when he came to get her.

227
00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:58.575
As for the two of you who knew Akiho was in my room,

228
00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:01.975
you could've moved the bed by working together.

229
00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:03.575
But at the time of crime,

230
00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:06.975
there wasn't a moment in which you were both gone,

231
00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:09.175
so that's impossible.

232
00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:13.875
Under such circumstances, how was the bed moved and who did it?

233
00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:15.575
Mr. Detective.

234
00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:18.775
By putting wheels under the bed.

235
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.275
-Wheels? -I see!

236
00:14:21.275 --> 00:14:24.175
Seiji had a road bike.

237
00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:28.175
He must have utilized the bike's tires.

238
00:14:28.175 --> 00:14:30.475
Utilized them...

239
00:14:30.475 --> 00:14:32.175
How did he do it?

240
00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:34.275
It wasn't the bike!

241
00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:36.875
Wasn't there someone with toys

242
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:39.475
that could easily be placed under the bed?

243
00:14:39.475 --> 00:14:42.275
By toys, do you mean the mini cars?

244
00:14:42.275 --> 00:14:44.075
Yeah, that's right.

245
00:14:44.075 --> 00:14:46.475
A single person can lift a bed one corner at a time

246
00:14:46.475 --> 00:14:50.075
and place a mini car under each leg.

247
00:14:50.075 --> 00:14:53.575
With wheels under each of the four bed legs,

248
00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:57.275
it would be easy for one to slide the bed.

249
00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:00.575
The person who was lining up mini cars in the hotel room

250
00:15:00.575 --> 00:15:04.175
was you, Mr. Takehiko!

251
00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:07.275
The proof is the small blood tracks

252
00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:10.575
that are evenly spaced near the leg of the bed.

253
00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.475
It's likely that the mini car tires

254
00:15:12.475 --> 00:15:16.975
ran over the blood stains on the carpet when you moved the bed.

255
00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:20.975
I guess you've already disposed of those mini cars though.

256
00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:25.175
But Mr. Mouri, if he had just placed the bed on top of the mini cars,

257
00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:29.675
it would have slipped off while it was being moved.

258
00:15:31.475 --> 00:15:33.075
That's true.

259
00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:36.975
So it turns out you didn't figure it out, Pops.

260
00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:39.575
I don't think a man who likes mini cars so much

261
00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:43.175
would do anything like that to damage them.

262
00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:47.975
He was so proud of them when he showed them to me yesterday.

263
00:15:47.975 --> 00:15:51.975
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

264
00:15:53.475 --> 00:15:58.275
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

265
00:15:58.275 --> 00:16:00.475
This Porsche.

266
00:16:00.475 --> 00:16:04.775
The car that James Dean drove, the Porsche 911.

267
00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:06.775
Porsche 911?

268
00:16:06.775 --> 00:16:09.575
But the car that James Dean drove was...

269
00:16:09.575 --> 00:16:13.875
The Porsche 550 Spider, a convertible.

270
00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:16.775
I see! He could have placed the bed leg

271
00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:20.675
into the opening where the seats are.

272
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:23.975
That... That would certainly stabilize it.

273
00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:28.575
That's why you couldn't show the 550 Spider to Conan.

274
00:16:28.575 --> 00:16:32.675
It's because the bed leg damaged the seats.

275
00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:36.375
But why didn't Mr. Takehiko leave immediately after the murder

276
00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:38.075
instead of using that trick?

277
00:16:38.075 --> 00:16:41.875
If Eri had discovered the body immediately after returning to the room,

278
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.375
he'd become the first suspect

279
00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:48.875
since she had asked him to come and pick the victim up.

280
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:51.675
That's why after killing your wife,

281
00:16:51.675 --> 00:16:55.475
you held the door open using a stopper and returned to your room,

282
00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:59.375
then came back with your mini cars and deployed the trick, didn't you?

283
00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:04.075
You figured that if it seemed like an impossible crime,

284
00:17:04.075 --> 00:17:05.975
it would divert attention away from you.

285
00:17:05.975 --> 00:17:08.575
But the trick couldn't be used

286
00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:12.075
if the attorney hadn't gone into the bathroom.

287
00:17:12.075 --> 00:17:16.075
That's why you were very lucky.

288
00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:20.875
But who would wait under the bed with a body on such an off chance?

289
00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:22.375
That's true.

290
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.875
No one in their right mind would do that.

291
00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:28.075
Encouraged from a few drinks, perhaps?

292
00:17:28.075 --> 00:17:29.475
I don't think so.

293
00:17:29.475 --> 00:17:31.975
Speaking of drinking,

294
00:17:31.975 --> 00:17:34.175
whenever Pops comes home from drinking,

295
00:17:34.175 --> 00:17:36.675
he usually shouts something, doesn't he?

296
00:17:36.675 --> 00:17:39.475
"Ran, bring me some water."

297
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.375
That's true, but...

298
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:43.875
Why are you bringing that up now?

299
00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:46.775
The reason why one gets thirsty after drinking

300
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:51.275
is that a dehydration reaction occurs as the body breaks down alcohol.

301
00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:55.675
You already knew I would come back to the room at around 11:00 pm.

302
00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:59.275
You could have assumed that I was going for a drink with someone.

303
00:17:59.275 --> 00:18:00.675
That's why...

304
00:18:02.175 --> 00:18:05.275
you put only carbonated drinks in my refrigerator

305
00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:07.775
and shook up every single can.

306
00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:10.375
That way, when I open it,

307
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:14.175
the content would spray up and force me to take a shower.

308
00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:19.875
Well, since we haven't found the murder weapon,

309
00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:22.075
why don't we examine

310
00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:27.075
the glass ashtray in Room 309 where Takehiko was staying?

311
00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:30.675
It seems all of the rooms have those ashtrays.

312
00:18:30.675 --> 00:18:33.475
If he took the murder weapon with him

313
00:18:33.475 --> 00:18:35.875
to make it seem like an extremely impossible crime,

314
00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:40.175
he would have to switch it with the one in his room.

315
00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:44.575
A short while later,

316
00:18:44.575 --> 00:18:48.475
luminal reaction test on the ashtray in Room 309 proved positive.

317
00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:50.975
It was Akiho's blood.

318
00:18:50.975 --> 00:18:54.875
Takehiko also confessed to the crime.

319
00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:57.075
The motive was the mini cars.

320
00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:59.575
He had heard that Akiho was a former race queen

321
00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:01.275
and model who liked mini cars,

322
00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:03.575
so they got along well and got married.

323
00:19:04.475 --> 00:19:06.875
But last night, she laughed and told him that it was all a lie

324
00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:10.775
in order to lure a wealthy man like Takehiko to herself.

325
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:16.375
What pushed him over the edge were her final words.

326
00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:21.475
Have you realized the meaning of the birthday present I gave you?

327
00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:24.575
Yeah, the 550 Spider?

328
00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:28.775
That was the beloved car of a famous movie star, right?

329
00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:31.775
It's a car you can't buy unless you're rich, right?

330
00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:36.475
In other words, I only married you because of your money.

331
00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:39.875
I can't wait to inherit it after your death!

332
00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:48.175
That was quite a present, wasn't it?

333
00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:51.675
Yeah, I wouldn't want to get something like that.

334
00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:56.775
My, my. I think it's better than getting nothing at all.

335
00:19:56.775 --> 00:19:59.775
All right, I'll be heading home now.

336
00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:02.075
Aren't you going to stay at the hotel?

337
00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:03.675
It's already 11:00 pm.

338
00:20:03.675 --> 00:20:06.675
It's fine. I've already called a taxi.

339
00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:09.475
-See you. -Don't leave.

340
00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:14.175
Although there's only an hour left, it's still your birthday.

341
00:20:14.175 --> 00:20:16.675
Why don't the two of us celebrate it?

342
00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:19.575
We'll send Ran and the brat off to another room...

343
00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:25.275
and relive the time when we were lovers.

344
00:20:25.275 --> 00:20:28.275
This is a little something from me.

345
00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:32.175
Well, since you're an adult, I guess you won't be thrilled

346
00:20:32.175 --> 00:20:33.975
receiving something trivial like a birthday present.

347
00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:36.875
Excuse me. Whose birthday is it?

348
00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:38.775
Yours, of course!

349
00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:41.575
-It's the same day as Sports Day! -What?

350
00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:48.175
Speaking of Sports Day, it used to be on October 10th, right?

351
00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:52.875
That's right. But now it falls on the second Monday in October.

352
00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:54.075
What?

353
00:20:56.275 --> 00:21:01.375
Does dad only remembers mom's birthday through Sports Day?

354
00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:03.375
It's because when we were kids,

355
00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:05.875
you always said this at the Sports Day event,

356
00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:09.475
"Today's my birthday, so I can't lose"!

357
00:21:09.475 --> 00:21:12.075
October 10th is usually a bright and sunny day,

358
00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:16.175
so schools used to hold their sports event on that day.

359
00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:20.875
What is this? I purposely lowered and raised the expectation.

360
00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:22.675
So it was all meaningless?

361
00:21:22.675 --> 00:21:24.775
Lowered and then raised it?

362
00:21:24.775 --> 00:21:27.275
So that's why you were so cold to mom.

363
00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:30.575
You didn't need to lower her expectations.

364
00:21:30.575 --> 00:21:36.475
In any case, I'll gladly accept these spoils of war,

365
00:21:36.475 --> 00:21:39.375
you dumb detective.

366
00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:12.175
"Law Eri Kisaki" -And the next day...

367
00:23:12.175 --> 00:23:13.475
Hey.

368
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:17.475
What in the world is this? The content of the present!

369
00:23:17.475 --> 00:23:21.275
I thought it was a necklace, but they're prayer beads!

370
00:23:22.575 --> 00:23:26.375
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Is that man telling me to die?

371
00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:30.375
The manager at Poirot asked dad to buy those prayer beads.

372
00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:33.875
It looks like he brought the wrong thing by mistake.

373
00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.275
There it is!

374
00:23:42.575 --> 00:23:45.675
Pops, that's too big of a mistake.

375
00:23:48.575 --> 00:23:51.675
The house of a person who makes aquariums!

376
00:23:53.175 --> 00:23:55.075
Awesome!

377
00:23:55.075 --> 00:23:58.675
Look at that, Ai. All the pretty fish!

378
00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:05.475
As he was drunk, he probably fell asleep while bathing, and drowned.

379
00:24:05.475 --> 00:24:08.575
If Mr. Nishida died on Friday night,

380
00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:11.675
it's strange that the glue hasn't dried.

381
00:24:11.675 --> 00:24:15.575
