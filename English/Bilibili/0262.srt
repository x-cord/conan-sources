1
00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:03.124
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:05.224
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:06.724
The mystery of the samurai in the suit of armor is solved,

4
00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:08.924
Sadness is behind the legend.

5
00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:10.524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:12.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:14.524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.337
We were headed for the hot springs

9
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.337
but a heavy snowfall closes the road

10
00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:05.137
and we end up staying at the Daimon residence.

11
00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:08.337
When we get up the next morning,

12
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:10.337
we learn that the head of the household,

13
00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:13.037
Genichiro Daimon has been found dead in the annex.

14
00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:16.037
And then the eldest son, Kazuki

15
00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:18.337
is found in the audio room wearing a suit of armor,

16
00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.137
dead under strange circumstances.

17
00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:29.637
"Frightening Legend On A Snowy Night (Part 2)"

18
00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:36.037
The wound is the same as Genichiro's,

19
00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:40.037
a single thrust with a sharp object.

20
00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:42.237
I believe it was with this sword.

21
00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:49.837
It's true. It's Hidetomo's curse, after all.

22
00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:56.037
That suit of armor summoned Hidetomo's spirit

23
00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:58.737
to punish my husband for all his dishonest dealings

24
00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:01.837
and Kazuki in the main house, too.

25
00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:03.937
And to show us it was the curse,

26
00:03:03.937 --> 00:03:06.737
he put the suit of armor on Kazuki.

27
00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:11.237
I can't prove if it was a curse or not

28
00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:13.937
but those footprints are for real.

29
00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:15.837
The only footprints leading from the annex to the main house

30
00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:18.037
are those from the warrior in the suit of armor.

31
00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:21.437
Which means...

32
00:03:21.437 --> 00:03:23.937
Do you really think it was the warrior the suit of armor?

33
00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:28.737
At any rate, we've got to call the police.

34
00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:32.937
I want everyone to wait in the living room

35
00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:35.637
until the police arrive.

36
00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:38.337
I'll go and prepare some coffee.

37
00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:42.437
-Now's my chance. -No, you don't!

38
00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:44.637
Dad is going to be angry.

39
00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:45.637
But...

40
00:03:45.637 --> 00:03:48.437
Hatsuho! We'll help you.

41
00:03:49.537 --> 00:03:51.237
We'll be waiting, please hurry.

42
00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:53.737
The police won't be able to get here right away

43
00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:55.537
because of the heavy snow.

44
00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:57.137
I see.

45
00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:58.337
Yoshiro.

46
00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:01.337
You're the only one who can protect this family now.

47
00:04:01.337 --> 00:04:03.037
Mother.

48
00:04:04.537 --> 00:04:08.537
I wonder who could have killed father and Kazuki.

49
00:04:11.537 --> 00:04:13.737
What is that stain?

50
00:04:13.737 --> 00:04:16.537
Blood? From the murder scene?

51
00:04:16.537 --> 00:04:17.937
No.

52
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:20.337
There's only one possibility.

53
00:04:20.337 --> 00:04:23.637
Kazuki killed Genichiro in the annex

54
00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:26.537
then returned to the audio room and committed suicide.

55
00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:29.237
Why would Kazuki do such a thing?

56
00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:32.437
He had a good reason, didn't he?

57
00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:34.737
Kazuki criticized father's methods

58
00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:36.437
and they were always fighting!

59
00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:38.837
Maybe he got carried away and...

60
00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:41.637
That sounds just like the legend of the suit of armor.

61
00:04:43.737 --> 00:04:45.837
What about you, Yoshiro?

62
00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:49.137
You came back to settle things with father, didn't you?

63
00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:50.637
It applies to you, too.

64
00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:54.937
Maybe all that talk about becoming a guitarist was a lie

65
00:04:54.937 --> 00:04:56.637
and what you really wanted was

66
00:04:56.637 --> 00:04:59.437
to become president of Daimon Industries.

67
00:04:59.437 --> 00:05:01.637
If father and Kazuki were out of the way,

68
00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:05.237
you'd be guaranteed the position, wouldn't you?

69
00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:07.337
What utter nonsense!

70
00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:10.537
How did I get to the annex in the first place?

71
00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.537
There were no footprints leading from the main house.

72
00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:16.037
Well, the same goes for Kazuki, too.

73
00:05:17.737 --> 00:05:19.437
It's true that there were only

74
00:05:19.437 --> 00:05:22.337
footprints leading from the annex to the main house.

75
00:05:22.337 --> 00:05:25.037
It's the curse.

76
00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:27.037
The armor clad warrior walked from the annex

77
00:05:27.037 --> 00:05:29.137
to the main house in the middle of the night,

78
00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:30.937
I saw it with my own eyes.

79
00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:33.537
Perhaps you were dreaming, mother.

80
00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:35.937
I was not dreaming!

81
00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:38.837
I saw it with my own eyes. I know I did.

82
00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:43.537
The huge form of the warrior in the suit of armor

83
00:05:43.537 --> 00:05:45.537
walked under the moonlight.

84
00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:54.537
Excuse me, madam. Was the warrior carrying a sword?

85
00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:57.537
Let me see.

86
00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:03.037
I don't think he had a sword.

87
00:06:03.037 --> 00:06:07.037
Maybe it was in his right hand though.

88
00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:11.637
Gosh. What a stupid question.

89
00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:16.137
There's two problems.

90
00:06:16.137 --> 00:06:18.337
How did Genichiro's killer get to the annex

91
00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:21.737
without leaving any footprints?

92
00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:26.337
And why did the killer head for the audio room?

93
00:06:28.937 --> 00:06:30.737
I see! I've figured it out!

94
00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:35.237
I don't understand what everybody's talking about.

95
00:06:35.237 --> 00:06:37.237
I'm going outside to play in the snow.

96
00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:39.737
Hey! You stay right here!

97
00:06:39.737 --> 00:06:42.137
What the heck are you thinking about at a time like this?

98
00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:46.337
That's enough!

99
00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:51.437
Gosh. How many times do I have tell you not to wander around?

100
00:06:51.437 --> 00:06:52.837
Good.

101
00:06:52.837 --> 00:06:56.137
Look, Pops. My footprints are gone.

102
00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:57.537
I wonder why?

103
00:06:57.537 --> 00:07:00.437
What? You're talking nonsense!

104
00:07:04.537 --> 00:07:06.437
Maybe that's what happened.

105
00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:10.537
Now's my chance.

106
00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:16.837
The door was locked from the inside.

107
00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:19.537
The walls are thick, like all audio rooms.

108
00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:21.737
There are no spaces around the door

109
00:07:21.737 --> 00:07:24.337
so you can operate it from the outside.

110
00:07:24.337 --> 00:07:27.137
The power on the audio set was off

111
00:07:27.137 --> 00:07:31.237
and the wound on the body was the same as Genichiro's.

112
00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:34.737
Both of them were probably killed with that sword.

113
00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:38.637
But why was that sword lying near the door?

114
00:07:38.637 --> 00:07:41.637
The sheath was by the body.

115
00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:44.637
Did Kazuki throw it there after stabbing himself?

116
00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:47.237
No, that's impossible.

117
00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:53.937
Why's there a scratch here with blood on it?

118
00:07:56.037 --> 00:07:57.837
There's no blood on the tip.

119
00:08:01.337 --> 00:08:03.337
That's it!

120
00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:05.737
I've figured how this room was locked.

121
00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:14.037
I knew it. There's no blood splatter on him.

122
00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:15.837
Who could have done it?

123
00:08:17.637 --> 00:08:19.437
What's this?

124
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:24.237
He's barefoot!

125
00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:29.137
Wait a minute. The killer took the socks, too.

126
00:08:29.137 --> 00:08:31.837
If the killer didn't mean to put them on Kazuki,

127
00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:33.737
then why take them in the first place?

128
00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:37.937
Did the killer use them for something else?

129
00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.337
And if so, what was it?

130
00:08:44.737 --> 00:08:47.837
I see. I've got it!

131
00:08:47.837 --> 00:08:49.137
And if I'm right,

132
00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:50.837
then it must be hidden somewhere.

133
00:08:50.837 --> 00:08:54.637
Listen up, everyone. I've solved the mystery.

134
00:08:54.637 --> 00:08:57.937
You mean about the footprints going in only one direction?

135
00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.837
That's right.

136
00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:03.137
The way I figure it, late last night,

137
00:09:03.137 --> 00:09:07.637
Kazuki went to the annex wearing flat sandals or something

138
00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:11.337
and for some reason, he killed his father.

139
00:09:11.337 --> 00:09:14.637
After that, he put the suit of armor on

140
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.637
and headed for the main house,

141
00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:21.437
very carefully retracing his footsteps.

142
00:09:21.437 --> 00:09:24.337
Since he had the suit of armor on which added to his weight,

143
00:09:24.337 --> 00:09:26.737
his previous footprints were completely erased

144
00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:30.237
and the only footprints that remained

145
00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.037
were those going from the annex to the main house.

146
00:09:33.037 --> 00:09:34.337
I see.

147
00:09:34.337 --> 00:09:37.337
He then returned to the audio room but felt guilt.

148
00:09:37.337 --> 00:09:39.337
He locked himself in

149
00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:44.537
and committed suicide by stabbing himself in the throat.

150
00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:46.437
I... I don't believe it.

151
00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:48.537
He would never do such a thing!

152
00:09:58.237 --> 00:09:59.737
I knew it.

153
00:09:59.737 --> 00:10:03.137
Now to find "the thing", I know it's hidden someplace.

154
00:10:08.237 --> 00:10:09.637
What is this?

155
00:10:12.837 --> 00:10:14.637
So that's what this was about.

156
00:10:16.537 --> 00:10:18.137
Here it is!

157
00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:20.837
I've found it. Just as I figured,

158
00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:24.137
these murders were committed using the legend of Hidetomo's curse.

159
00:10:24.137 --> 00:10:27.537
And the real killer is that person.

160
00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:39.945
Mr. Mouri, I don't believe he'd commit suicide.

161
00:10:39.945 --> 00:10:41.845
I'm sorry, madam,

162
00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:43.445
but it's the truth.

163
00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:48.645
Mr. Mouri?

164
00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:53.245
Actually, I said that just to throw the killer off guard.

165
00:10:53.245 --> 00:10:54.345
What?

166
00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:55.945
What do you mean?

167
00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:58.945
That's only half of my theory.

168
00:10:58.945 --> 00:11:01.045
Like I just explained, Genichiro's killer

169
00:11:01.045 --> 00:11:06.045
returned to the main house erasing the earlier footprints.

170
00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:09.045
Anyone could have done this except for Kazuki

171
00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:13.945
and the elder Mrs. Daimon who saw the warrior outside.

172
00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:16.145
What do you mean, anyone?

173
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.045
What you're saying is,

174
00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:21.945
Kazuki who committed suicide didn't kill father.

175
00:11:21.945 --> 00:11:23.345
That's right.

176
00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:26.945
Your brother did not kill your father.

177
00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:30.145
And he didn't commit suicide either.

178
00:11:31.945 --> 00:11:35.345
Judging from the wound on Genichiro,

179
00:11:35.345 --> 00:11:38.245
I'd assume the killer was splattered with blood

180
00:11:38.245 --> 00:11:40.545
but Kazuki's clothes...

181
00:11:40.545 --> 00:11:45.345
His clothes under the suit of armor was spotless.

182
00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:47.945
After the killing Genichiro,

183
00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:49.945
the killer snuck into the audio room

184
00:11:49.945 --> 00:11:52.145
and killed Kazuki.

185
00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:53.745
But how?

186
00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:57.445
Remember the sword on the floor of the audio room?

187
00:11:58.545 --> 00:12:02.545
We looked upon it as the murder weapon, nothing else.

188
00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:07.145
But that sword was not just the murder weapon,

189
00:12:07.145 --> 00:12:10.845
it served another purpose, too.

190
00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:14.545
It was used to lock the audio room.

191
00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:15.745
What?

192
00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:18.145
After killing Kazuki,

193
00:12:18.145 --> 00:12:20.945
the killer put the suit of armor on him

194
00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:24.345
and stuck the sword into the wall by the door.

195
00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:29.745
Then took the hilt on the opposite end

196
00:12:29.745 --> 00:12:31.245
and placed it on top of the door handle

197
00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:33.845
so that it would touch the bolt.

198
00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:36.945
The killer then exited the room cautiously

199
00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:39.245
so the sword wouldn't fall then very, very slowly closed the door,

200
00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:42.345
the hilt of the sword pushed against the bolt...

201
00:12:45.045 --> 00:12:47.545
And there you have it, a locked room.

202
00:12:48.845 --> 00:12:50.545
To open a door as sturdy as that,

203
00:12:50.545 --> 00:12:53.545
you'd have to break it down.

204
00:12:55.445 --> 00:12:58.345
The vibrations created when the door was being broken

205
00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:00.045
would cause the sword to fall

206
00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:02.345
and the set up would never be discovered.

207
00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:06.345
I'm sure that's what the killer planned.

208
00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:08.745
But why would anyone do such a thing?

209
00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:11.145
Before I answer that, you all must think

210
00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.545
as to why this happened on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death.

211
00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:15.645
It has a special meaning.

212
00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:17.945
The killer used the legend of Hidetomo's suit of armor

213
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:20.745
to it's full extent.

214
00:13:20.745 --> 00:13:22.245
The killer created the illusion of

215
00:13:22.245 --> 00:13:24.045
one set of footprints going in one direction,

216
00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:25.545
so that we'd all believe

217
00:13:25.545 --> 00:13:29.145
only the armor clad warrior was capable of committing the murder

218
00:13:29.145 --> 00:13:30.745
and succeeded in making us think

219
00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:36.345
Kazuki killed his father then committed suicide.

220
00:13:37.345 --> 00:13:39.545
And to support the illusion,

221
00:13:39.545 --> 00:13:42.445
the killer made Tatsuko, who believed strongly in the legend,

222
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:45.545
see the warrior walk.

223
00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:50.945
At 12 midnight on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death,

224
00:13:50.945 --> 00:13:52.645
she prays at the altar,

225
00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:56.645
everyone in this family knows that.

226
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:03.145
Unfortunately, that's where the killer left us a clue.

227
00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.245
Madam.

228
00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.945
Last night, when you saw the armor clad warrior,

229
00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:10.845
it wasn't carrying a sword, was it?

230
00:14:10.845 --> 00:14:12.745
No, it wasn't.

231
00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:15.745
Actually, he did indeed have it with him.

232
00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:17.445
It's just that from Tatsuko's position,

233
00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:21.945
she couldn't see it in his right hand.

234
00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.845
Which means, the killer was probably left handed.

235
00:14:24.845 --> 00:14:27.145
What?

236
00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:28.445
It wasn't me!

237
00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:30.645
Besides, how do you know the killer was left handed

238
00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:32.945
if the sword was in the right?

239
00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:35.645
In order to draw the sword with the left hand,

240
00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:39.045
you need to hold the sheath in your right, don't you?

241
00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.845
That's...

242
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:44.145
But Yoshiro is not the killer.

243
00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:45.445
What?

244
00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:49.845
There is another left handed person here.

245
00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:53.145
Hatsuho Hojo! It's you!

246
00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:56.845
Hatsuho.

247
00:14:56.845 --> 00:14:59.945
You're left handed too, aren't you?

248
00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:02.445
You used your left hand

249
00:15:02.445 --> 00:15:04.845
when you served us coffee just now.

250
00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:06.845
Yes, that's right.

251
00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:10.845
But you need special skills to handle a sword, don't you?

252
00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:13.245
And another thing, I had no motive

253
00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:16.145
for killing Mr. Daimon or his son!

254
00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:20.145
Ran. Can you go to Hatsuho's room

255
00:15:20.245 --> 00:15:22.545
and get an old photo frame from the drawer in the chest?

256
00:15:24.045 --> 00:15:25.845
Okay.

257
00:15:26.945 --> 00:15:29.745
While we wait for Ran to get back, there's another thing.

258
00:15:29.745 --> 00:15:33.345
Hatsuho, you said you looked out your window at the annex

259
00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:37.345
and saw that Genichiro was dead. Isn't that right?

260
00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:38.845
Yes.

261
00:15:38.845 --> 00:15:41.245
Master Daimon is...

262
00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:43.445
Master Daimon is dead in his room!

263
00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:48.045
But think carefully.

264
00:15:48.045 --> 00:15:52.945
How could you tell by looking from the main house to the annex

265
00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:57.845
whether Genichiro was dead or just lying on the floor?

266
00:15:57.845 --> 00:16:02.445
Well, when I saw him on the floor, I got so excited.

267
00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:04.745
Ran, you're back.

268
00:16:04.745 --> 00:16:07.545
Put the photo there where everyone can see.

269
00:16:07.545 --> 00:16:08.845
Okay.

270
00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:13.145
So tell me, Yoshiro.

271
00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:16.445
Do you recognize the person in that photo?

272
00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:20.245
It looks like Hatsuho and that's probably her father.

273
00:16:21.445 --> 00:16:22.645
He's...

274
00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:25.045
It's the man in the newspaper article. The one who committed suicide!

275
00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:29.645
That's right.

276
00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:33.245
She did have a motive for killing the two.

277
00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.745
Hatsuho.

278
00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:41.345
You watched Kazuki in the audio room

279
00:16:41.345 --> 00:16:46.045
to make sure the tranquilizer in his coffee took effect,

280
00:16:46.045 --> 00:16:48.445
then you headed for the annex through the back door.

281
00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:52.845
Genichiro would surely open the door for her

282
00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:56.845
without a second thought if she were to call out to him.

283
00:16:56.845 --> 00:17:01.845
After killing him, you put the suit of armor on

284
00:17:01.845 --> 00:17:05.245
and walked back to the main house over your own footprints.

285
00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:08.445
You used a route where you wouldn't be seen

286
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:11.245
from Yoshiro, Kayoko or our rooms.

287
00:17:11.245 --> 00:17:17.245
It could only be seen from Tatsuko and your room.

288
00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:21.745
When you went to the annex,

289
00:17:21.745 --> 00:17:23.845
you probably covered yourself with a white sheet or something

290
00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:28.845
so that if someone saw you, you'd blend in with the snow.

291
00:17:28.845 --> 00:17:31.945
After committing the murder, you hurriedly stuffed the sheet

292
00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:35.145
into the bedroom closet in the annex.

293
00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:37.945
I found it sticking out.

294
00:17:37.945 --> 00:17:41.745
It's all... It's all just theoretical!

295
00:17:41.745 --> 00:17:44.245
Yes, it was my father who committed suicide.

296
00:17:44.245 --> 00:17:46.845
And yes, so I changed my name to hide my past

297
00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:49.145
so no one would know.

298
00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:53.545
But that doesn't prove I killed the two men!

299
00:17:53.545 --> 00:17:56.145
I have proof.

300
00:17:56.145 --> 00:17:58.745
It's inside the stove in the kitchen.

301
00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.245
Conan found it.

302
00:18:02.245 --> 00:18:05.345
Inside the stove, he found a bloody jacket

303
00:18:05.345 --> 00:18:08.445
and the white socks Tatsuko left on the altar.

304
00:18:08.445 --> 00:18:09.945
So you found them in the kitchen,

305
00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:12.245
that doesn't prove I put them there!

306
00:18:12.245 --> 00:18:16.645
Somebody might have put them there to frame me!

307
00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:19.245
After the murders, it would have been possible for anyone

308
00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:20.445
to hide them there!

309
00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:24.045
Unfortunately, you were the only one with the opportunity.

310
00:18:24.045 --> 00:18:26.145
The white socks Tatsuko left by the suit of armor

311
00:18:26.145 --> 00:18:27.445
disappeared from the annex

312
00:18:27.445 --> 00:18:29.445
but they weren't on the victim's body.

313
00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:35.045
If the killer didn't mean to put them on Kazuki,

314
00:18:35.045 --> 00:18:38.845
they why did the killer take them then hide them in the stove?

315
00:18:40.045 --> 00:18:41.345
Hatsuho.

316
00:18:41.345 --> 00:18:44.145
You've hurt your left foot, haven't you?

317
00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:49.245
It appears you didn't bandage it well enough.

318
00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:53.245
It seems to have started bleeding again a little while ago.

319
00:18:53.245 --> 00:18:56.645
When you were serving the coffee just now,

320
00:18:56.645 --> 00:18:59.945
I noticed some blood on your sock.

321
00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:15.145
When you killed Genichiro in the annex,

322
00:19:15.145 --> 00:19:17.245
you dropped and broke the cup.

323
00:19:19.445 --> 00:19:22.545
You mistakenly stepped on the glass cutting your foot.

324
00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:25.845
You knew that if you put the warrior's shoes on,

325
00:19:25.845 --> 00:19:28.545
you'd get blood on them.

326
00:19:28.545 --> 00:19:33.645
So you put the socks Tatsuko had left

327
00:19:33.645 --> 00:19:35.645
and then put the shoes on over them.

328
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:41.945
Then you hid the socks in the kitchen stove

329
00:19:41.945 --> 00:19:44.945
along with the jacket.

330
00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:47.345
You realized that using the stove in the middle of the night

331
00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:49.145
would cause suspicion.

332
00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:52.545
So you decided to wait until morning then burn the evidence.

333
00:19:52.545 --> 00:19:54.945
But when you went to prepare the coffee,

334
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:58.545
Ran went with you so you lost the opportunity.

335
00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:09.045
Yes, you're right.

336
00:20:09.045 --> 00:20:11.245
I killed both of them.

337
00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:13.445
Why did you do it?

338
00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:17.345
You were always so kind to me.

339
00:20:17.345 --> 00:20:20.845
My father, who ran the factory, was an old-fashioned man.

340
00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:24.245
He felt that helping others was more important than making money.

341
00:20:24.245 --> 00:20:26.445
He took Daimon Industries orders

342
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:27.645
although it was too much to handle

343
00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:31.145
just because they'd done business with them for so long.

344
00:20:31.145 --> 00:20:33.445
But one day, just because of one little error,

345
00:20:33.445 --> 00:20:36.645
Daimon Industries stopped using our factory.

346
00:20:36.645 --> 00:20:39.945
My father's company went bankrupt.

347
00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:42.345
Daimon Industries was having financial troubles

348
00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:45.945
but saved themselves by sacrificing my father's company.

349
00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:48.245
And as if to rub salt in my father's wounds,

350
00:20:48.245 --> 00:20:50.845
Genichiro took the suit of armor from my father

351
00:20:50.845 --> 00:20:51.945
as payment for debts due,

352
00:20:51.945 --> 00:20:54.745
that suit of armor was a family heirloom.

353
00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:58.145
It happened just when father decided to sell the suit of armor

354
00:20:58.145 --> 00:21:01.445
in order to pay the employees their salaries.

355
00:21:02.745 --> 00:21:05.645
He wasn't able to do anything for the employees

356
00:21:05.645 --> 00:21:09.045
and on top of that, he couldn't use the family heirloom to help anyone.

357
00:21:09.045 --> 00:21:12.645
Father killed himself because he blamed himself for everything.

358
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:17.045
I had been working in Tokyo,

359
00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:20.445
but in order to avenge my father, I changed my name

360
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.845
and last year, I came here to work as their live in help.

361
00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:25.345
I was determined to carry out my revenge

362
00:21:25.345 --> 00:21:28.045
on the anniversary of father's death.

363
00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:31.345
Hatsuho.

364
00:21:31.345 --> 00:21:34.345
Do you think your father is happy

365
00:21:34.345 --> 00:21:36.845
that you avenged his death?

366
00:21:36.845 --> 00:21:39.845
Do you think he'd praise you?

367
00:21:41.045 --> 00:21:43.045
Hatsuho.

368
00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:47.345
It wasn't Hidetomo's spirit that put that suit of armor on.

369
00:21:47.345 --> 00:21:52.545
Your heart wore the suit of armor,

370
00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:56.345
the cold armor called revenge.

371
00:23:27.945 --> 00:23:29.345
Ouch!

372
00:23:29.345 --> 00:23:31.245
Conan, are you all right?

373
00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.545
Ran, you okay?

374
00:23:37.245 --> 00:23:41.345
The imprint I left got erased by yours.

375
00:23:41.345 --> 00:23:45.345
It's just like that case with the suit of armor, don't you think?

376
00:23:45.345 --> 00:23:46.745
Oh, no!

377
00:23:46.745 --> 00:23:50.045
Conan. What are you trying to say?

378
00:23:50.045 --> 00:23:53.045
I... I didn't mean anything by that.

379
00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:55.645
Hey! Come back here, Conan!

380
00:23:55.645 --> 00:23:58.045
I'm sorry!

381
00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:01.345
Did she think I meant she was bigger and heavier?

382
00:24:05.345 --> 00:24:07.545
"Next Episode" -The point is where and what you were doing

383
00:24:07.545 --> 00:24:10.745
during the time the crime was committed.

384
00:24:10.745 --> 00:24:12.945
I don't remember anything.

385
00:24:12.945 --> 00:24:15.745
Do you remember him?

386
00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:17.945
I'm sure I've seen this guy.

387
00:24:17.945 --> 00:24:22.545
Kogoro Mouri is Attorney Kisaki's husband, isn't he?

388
00:24:22.545 --> 00:24:23.645
Yes.

389
00:24:23.645 --> 00:24:26.245
This is getting to be quite interesting.

390
00:24:26.245 --> 00:24:29.045
Wait a sec. If so...

391
00:24:29.745 --> 00:24:35.266
Next Conan, "Battle in Court, Kisaki vs. Kogoro (Part 1)"

392
00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:38.063
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:38.063 --> 00:24:39.963
"Cellphone"
