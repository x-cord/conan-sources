1
00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:02.999
Doji Hiramune, a criminal psychologist,

2
00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:04.999
makes repeated challenging comments

3
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.399
against the serial killer

4
00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.199
whose case will expire in three days,

5
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.699
but he is found murdered to death in his house.

6
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.299
The letter Z is found carved on his back.

7
00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:20.699
The letters E, S, and W were also found on the bodies

8
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.299
of the three victims of the serial murder case.

9
00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.299
From the fact that the suspicious man

10
00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.499
that Ai and Ayumi witnessed was whistling.

11
00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.699
The police concludes that it is yet another series of murders

12
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.599
committed by the same serial killer.

13
00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:37.499
I accompany Officer Takagi who goes to visit

14
00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.999
the bereaved family of the victims

15
00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.199
and realize that the thing in common

16
00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.799
that connects the four victims is mahjong.

17
00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.099
I'll expose the true identity of the serial killer for sure.

18
00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.399
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

19
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.699
Saturday nights are for mystery.

20
00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.899
Officer Takagi is all out to get but falls into a pitfall.

21
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.899
Love as well as the case takes a sudden turn.

22
00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.499
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.299
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:56.045
"An Old Scar and the Soul of the Detective"

26
00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:00.145
I know these people.

27
00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.845
They used to come here and play mahjong together long time ago.

28
00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:05.945
They used to be one of my favorite guests.

29
00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:08.045
How nostalgic.

30
00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.445
Who is he?

31
00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.245
He's Mr. Hiramune a criminal psychologist.

32
00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:17.045
Only that picture is a very recent one.

33
00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:20.645
He's the student that used to play with the three all the time.

34
00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:23.945
Which means that these four men used to play mahjong here?

35
00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:28.645
Yes, they would get together at 10 pm on Saturday nights.

36
00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:29.845
The doctor,

37
00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:31.745
assistant professor of the science and technology department,

38
00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:32.945
a man who just became a lawyer

39
00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:36.345
and the university student that was studying criminal psychology.

40
00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.145
Although they were of different ages, they seem to get along very well.

41
00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:43.445
They used to discuss actual incidents that happened while playing mahjong.

42
00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:45.545
They would say things like the culprit

43
00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:47.545
is the one who was answering the interview,

44
00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:50.345
or that it was a trick using medical knowledge.

45
00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:54.245
Moreover, it's amazing that they were virtually almost always correct.

46
00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:56.845
And? What about the four?

47
00:03:56.845 --> 00:04:00.645
They were all murdered by the same killer.

48
00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.545
What?

49
00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.245
Four of them, all at once?

50
00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:07.845
No, the first one was murdered 20 years ago.

51
00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:09.345
Don't you know about it?

52
00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:11.845
I don't watch the news much.

53
00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:14.345
Because all I used to do was check the cases

54
00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:16.745
that they deduced in the papers.

55
00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:18.745
Well, but I did so only during the two years

56
00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:20.145
that they used to come here.

57
00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.445
After they stopped coming, I stopped buying the papers too.

58
00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:24.845
They stopped coming?

59
00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:25.845
Yes.

60
00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:29.045
They were saying something about a perfect crime or something

61
00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.445
but I couldn't hear them too well.

62
00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.545
After the others stopped coming,

63
00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.245
this student kept coming for a while.

64
00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:37.945
He used to sit at the table alone,

65
00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:40.245
looking sad as he wiped the tiles.

66
00:04:41.345 --> 00:04:44.645
Maybe that guy is the killer.

67
00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:46.845
Do you have an idea who it may be?

68
00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:52.145
There was a man who used to always give them a piece of his mind.

69
00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:56.845
And after the remaining members stopped coming,

70
00:04:56.845 --> 00:04:59.545
that man used to take the opportunity to hassle

71
00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:01.345
the student who was waiting all alone.

72
00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:03.845
Back then, that man shouted,

73
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.745
"I'm going to get all of you!"

74
00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:08.945
Do you know who that man is?

75
00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:10.045
I wonder...

76
00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:12.445
I heard that he had a reputation for doing all kinds of wrong

77
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.145
but I have no idea what his name is.

78
00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:18.045
Remember that incident long ago when a gun was stolen?

79
00:05:18.045 --> 00:05:20.545
While the police officer at the police box was put to sleep and off guard,

80
00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:23.445
the gun was stolen and freaked everybody out.

81
00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:26.745
But two days later the gun was sent back and returned.

82
00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:31.045
It was rumored that the man was the one who did that too.

83
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.045
This is the mahjong tile that was thrown

84
00:05:33.045 --> 00:05:35.145
when they got into a big fight.

85
00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:38.445
It's scratched so it can't be used anymore.

86
00:05:38.445 --> 00:05:41.845
Did that man throw the tiles?

87
00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:43.245
Yes.

88
00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:46.145
And who put the tiles away?

89
00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.245
Me.

90
00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:51.245
After the police came to stop the two and took them away.

91
00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:53.945
I gathered the tiles alone and put them away in this case.

92
00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:56.745
Which means that the only fingerprints

93
00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:59.145
on the scratched tiles are yours, Mr. Hiramune,

94
00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:03.145
and that man's, right?

95
00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:05.045
Who is this kid?

96
00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:07.545
He's here with me to study social studies.

97
00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:10.145
Besides if the man was taken along with the police,

98
00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:12.245
there may be some kind of record left.

99
00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:13.845
Right.

100
00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:19.645
Then, I'm going to take this scratched tile with me.

101
00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.845
And, your fingerprint too.

102
00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:27.245
Come to think of it, I got a strange phone call last week.

103
00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:30.245
The person said, "20 years ago, the people who used to play

104
00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:32.545
at the table were a doctor, assistant professor, a lawyer,

105
00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:35.645
and a criminal psychologist, right?"

106
00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.845
What?

107
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:39.945
You were able to specify a man who could be the serial killer?

108
00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:42.545
Yes, sir. There was a record of the man

109
00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:44.345
who was brought to the police

110
00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:46.445
after getting into a fight with Mr. Hiramune.

111
00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:48.545
His address is unknown and he's unemployed.

112
00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:49.945
His name is...

113
00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:51.545
Dokuro Kibo.

114
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:52.945
Kibo?

115
00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.545
Dokuro Kibo?

116
00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:56.945
You mean that Kibo, who robbed and committed murder?

117
00:06:56.945 --> 00:06:58.945
If I remember correctly,

118
00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:00.845
I heard he finished his term of 15 years,

119
00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:03.445
and was released just the other day.

120
00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:07.545
Which means that the serial murders had stopped for 15 years because...

121
00:07:07.545 --> 00:07:11.145
Which means he couldn't do anything because he was behind bars.

122
00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:13.045
Yes, sir. Most probably.

123
00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:14.445
Okay.

124
00:07:14.445 --> 00:07:16.745
Search out the guy right away

125
00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:18.645
and bring him before me.

126
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:19.645
Yes, sir!

127
00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:24.545
Officer Takagi is sure out to get, isn't he?

128
00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.145
Maybe he found himself a girlfriend or something.

129
00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:27.245
Yes.

130
00:07:27.245 --> 00:07:29.545
There has been such rumors going around here and there.

131
00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:32.145
Tell him to keep on his guard.

132
00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:34.945
You know, like you see on TV and the movies.

133
00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:36.245
Stories about officers who die on duty

134
00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:39.345
because just as they are about to carry out an important

135
00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:40.845
promise with their loved one,

136
00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:43.545
they fall prey to the bullet of the culprit.

137
00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:46.545
But those are only made up stories.

138
00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:49.245
Morimura ended up that way too.

139
00:07:49.245 --> 00:07:51.045
His wedding was coming up in a month,

140
00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:53.445
so for the sake of his wife-to-be

141
00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:57.545
he wanted to make as many points as possible and rushed things.

142
00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:01.045
And as a result, he ended up being run over by the suspect's car.

143
00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:03.545
Let's go, Officer Sato.

144
00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:04.545
Yes.

145
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:08.545
Maybe I've aged.

146
00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:10.345
This scar...

147
00:08:10.345 --> 00:08:12.045
I reacted to a man who just happened

148
00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:14.145
to meet the suspect at a sauna.

149
00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:17.545
And today, when I went into the house of the fourth victim,

150
00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:20.145
this scar of mine was throbbing.

151
00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:21.745
But, now only several hours later,

152
00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:24.345
the throbbing's gone away

153
00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:26.545
as if nothing has happened.

154
00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:30.245
It could be that the heavens are telling me

155
00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:32.845
that my mission is over.

156
00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:35.845
Gee.

157
00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:38.545
I thought that Officer Takagi was working unusually fast

158
00:08:38.545 --> 00:08:41.345
but come to find out Conan did all the work.

159
00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.445
So, I guess the thing about going to a hot spring

160
00:08:43.445 --> 00:08:44.645
isn't going to be realized then.

161
00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:45.945
What?

162
00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:48.845
Why don't you go either way? Go to the hot spring with him.

163
00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:51.145
After all, he did pin down the culprit.

164
00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:52.845
Don't be stingy about it.

165
00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:55.945
No. Personal feelings shouldn't be mixed up with work.

166
00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:57.345
I almost forgot

167
00:08:57.345 --> 00:08:59.445
that this job of ours is one in which we could lose our lives

168
00:08:59.445 --> 00:09:01.045
with just one slight mistake.

169
00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:05.845
I'll take the children home in my car,

170
00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.845
so you go and join Officer Chiba and the others

171
00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:09.445
and investigate Kibo.

172
00:09:09.445 --> 00:09:10.645
Will do.

173
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.145
Yes. Sato here.

174
00:09:16.145 --> 00:09:19.545
What? You took custody of Kibo?

175
00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:22.245
We just found him in his apartment

176
00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:24.945
and asked him to come of his own initiative to the police,

177
00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:26.945
and is heading this way.

178
00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:28.745
Have Eiki, Mr. Nabei's son come over here.

179
00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:30.945
You're going to have him confirm his voice, right?

180
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:34.245
Because he heard the voice of the suspect when he was a child.

181
00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:36.245
Right. I'm counting on you.

182
00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:39.545
Officer Takagi, I'll leave Eiki to you.

183
00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.345
Yes, will do.

184
00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:45.345
He was arrested quite easily, wasn't he?

185
00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:47.145
The serial killer.

186
00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:48.645
I thought there was going to be more exciting chasing

187
00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:50.845
and around and all that.

188
00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:53.245
With a lot of guns firing and all.

189
00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:55.445
That's only in the movies and on TV.

190
00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:57.745
The actually is quite bland.

191
00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:59.345
You don't look happy.

192
00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:04.245
The letter Z that was left on Mr. Hiramune's back's bugging me.

193
00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:06.545
Since the letters in the order of E, S, W

194
00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:11.445
were found on the body of the victims who were killed

195
00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:13.545
in the previous three cases, the last letter should be N.

196
00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:17.445
Maybe the letters really meant nothing after all?

197
00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:19.045
If it meant east, west, south and north

198
00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:23.745
the order of the letters should be EWSN and not ESWN.

199
00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:27.845
No, but in mahjong the order is east, south, west and north,

200
00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:30.845
so it should be E, S, W,

201
00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:33.445
but I wonder why the last letter is Z?

202
00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:35.145
He was probably going to knock the corpse down on its side

203
00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:37.045
after he committed the murder.

204
00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:40.045
If you turn the letter Z sideways, it becomes an N.

205
00:10:40.045 --> 00:10:44.545
If so, I wonder why he didn't turn the corpse sideways.

206
00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:45.845
True.

207
00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.645
What concerns me is...

208
00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:51.045
the "Ctrl" key that Mr. Hiramune put his blood on.

209
00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:54.045
In other words, the control key and "C" key,

210
00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:55.545
with these two keys,

211
00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:58.045
I can tell he's trying to point out the computer,

212
00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:00.845
but I can't figure out why he's holding the cord of the mouse.

213
00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:02.245
Mouse?

214
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:06.345
That sort of round thing that you use to operate the computer.

215
00:11:06.345 --> 00:11:09.345
The cord that is connected to it looks like the tail of a mouse,

216
00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:10.945
so that's how it got it's name.

217
00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:16.345
Then, he's holding the tail of the mouse

218
00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:18.345
so that person is a cat.

219
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:23.345
Gee, come off it. Ayumi, what a cute thing to say!

220
00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:26.245
Very true.

221
00:11:26.245 --> 00:11:28.945
You don't have to laugh so hard.

222
00:11:28.945 --> 00:11:30.245
Cat...

223
00:11:30.245 --> 00:11:33.445
I see, that's what it was.

224
00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:38.745
This serial killer case had ended 15 years ago.

225
00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:41.145
Give me a break, officer.

226
00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:42.945
After serving a term of 15 years,

227
00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:45.645
I finally got out.

228
00:11:45.645 --> 00:11:48.945
I'd never commit murder again.

229
00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:51.645
Do you think this guy's the culprit?

230
00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:52.845
If we have Mr. Eiki Nabei

231
00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:55.445
who heard the voice of the suspect when he was a child,

232
00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:57.945
wouldn't that clear everything?

233
00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:02.545
What if it were you?

234
00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:06.445
What would you do if an officer

235
00:12:06.445 --> 00:12:08.845
who left a large sword scar on your face appeared before you?

236
00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:11.145
Well, I think I'd be surprised.

237
00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:15.745
The man didn't even raise a brow when he passed me.

238
00:12:16.845 --> 00:12:20.345
Maybe this guy Dokuro Kibo is...

239
00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:24.745
What? Dokuro Kibo isn't the serial killer?

240
00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:25.945
What makes you say that?

241
00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:32.145
I'm sure Mr. Hiramune knows what kind of person the culprit is.

242
00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:35.945
Besides, if the two fought in the past at the mahjong parlor,

243
00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:38.145
it's hard to believe that they would want to see each other,

244
00:12:38.145 --> 00:12:40.045
just the two of them.

245
00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:43.345
Moreover, in Mr. Hiramune's dying message says that

246
00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:48.045
the serial killer didn't kill him.

247
00:12:48.045 --> 00:12:51.145
Blood was on the control key and C key,

248
00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.945
pushing both keys means "copy".

249
00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:54.645
He was holding the cord of the mouse,

250
00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:57.745
which meant he was the cat that had grabbed the mouse's tail.

251
00:12:57.745 --> 00:13:00.845
Put the two together and you get the word "copycat".

252
00:13:00.845 --> 00:13:03.945
In other words, his message was that the one who killed him

253
00:13:03.945 --> 00:13:05.745
copied the murder method of the serial killer.

254
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:07.945
A mimicked murder?

255
00:13:07.945 --> 00:13:11.145
What's that, some kind of minced meat or something?

256
00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:14.645
It's this tomato tasting Italian soup with vegetables in it.

257
00:13:14.645 --> 00:13:16.045
That's minestrone.

258
00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:18.845
A mimicked murder is

259
00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:20.445
when someone copies somebody else's murder method

260
00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:22.445
to commit a murder.

261
00:13:23.745 --> 00:13:26.045
But, why is it a cat?

262
00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:28.645
The word copycat was comes from

263
00:13:28.645 --> 00:13:30.245
the fact that kittens copy their parents.

264
00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:34.045
But, how did Mr. Hiramune know that the killer was a copycat?

265
00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:36.445
He knew because...

266
00:13:36.445 --> 00:13:39.445
Mr. Hiramune, who was killed

267
00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:41.445
was actually the serial killer himself.

268
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:42.945
What?

269
00:13:42.945 --> 00:13:46.245
If so, it's not hard to understand

270
00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:49.045
why the letter Z was found on his back.

271
00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:52.945
The serial killer is supposed to have a large sword scar

272
00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:56.545
that was made by Superintendent Matsumoto on his back.

273
00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:58.445
In order to make his scar inconspicuous,

274
00:13:58.445 --> 00:14:02.645
to ward off any suspicion that he may be the serial killer,

275
00:14:02.645 --> 00:14:06.345
Mr. Hiramune secretly wrote the alphabet Z over his scar.

276
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.045
I see.

277
00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:10.245
Then, this murder could be made

278
00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:13.245
to look as if it were the serial murder case too.

279
00:14:13.245 --> 00:14:15.745
Yes, if the police is made to believe so,

280
00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:19.245
they will keep pursuing the dead serial murder

281
00:14:19.245 --> 00:14:22.645
and the culprit figured that their hands would never reach over to him.

282
00:14:22.645 --> 00:14:26.145
And? Who is that copycat?

283
00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:29.545
If he's the guy that was whistling,

284
00:14:29.545 --> 00:14:32.545
it's one of the members of the bereaved family.

285
00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.345
"Nabei"

286
00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:40.845
Strange. The lights are on and yet.

287
00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:43.845
It's open.

288
00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:46.145
Mr. Nabei.

289
00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:49.045
I'm from the police, I just visited you a while ago.

290
00:14:49.045 --> 00:14:52.545
Mr. Nabei, will you please come with me to the station?

291
00:14:52.545 --> 00:14:53.945
Mr. Nabei!

292
00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:07.221
All the members of the bereaved family may know

293
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:11.221
that the letter of the alphabet was carved on the victim's back,

294
00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:17.621
but the only one who knows that the killer whistles a certain tune,

295
00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:19.421
or uses mahjong terminology is...

296
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:20.521
It can't be.

297
00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:22.921
Mr. Eiki Nabei who was in the house together with the killer

298
00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.221
at the time of the murder?

299
00:15:24.221 --> 00:15:28.321
Right, he knows the voice of the killer

300
00:15:28.321 --> 00:15:31.521
so after hearing Mr. Hiramune's voice and his way of talking

301
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:32.821
through the many TV appearances he made,

302
00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:36.021
he probably called all the mahjong parlors

303
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:37.721
that his father may have stopped by at,

304
00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:40.521
and after he found the link between Mr. Hiramune and the three victims

305
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:44.621
he was convinced that Mr. Hiramune was the serial killer.

306
00:15:44.621 --> 00:15:48.121
It probably took him 15 years before he realized the truth

307
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:52.821
because Eiki wasn't familiar with mahjong terminology until he grew up.

308
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:54.321
Please wait.

309
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.321
He's the one who was angry when went to his house a while ago, right?

310
00:15:58.321 --> 00:16:00.721
Officer Takagi went to get him.

311
00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:08.221
Just as would be expected of an officer pursuing a serial murder case,

312
00:16:08.221 --> 00:16:11.421
you're armed with a gun.

313
00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:15.621
But, seeing that you've come here alone only shows

314
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:19.721
that I'm not deemed to be the culprit yet.

315
00:16:19.721 --> 00:16:20.921
The culprit?

316
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:24.921
Don't tell me that you killed your own father 15 years ago?

317
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.621
Idiot.

318
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:29.321
-Hiramune did that. -What?

319
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:32.521
I avenged my father's death today.

320
00:16:32.521 --> 00:16:34.121
I called Hiramune and told him,

321
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:36.221
"I just remembered something about the case 15 years ago,

322
00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:41.121
so before going to the police, I'd like to discuss it with you

323
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:43.921
since you're a criminal psychologist."

324
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:47.021
He didn't have the slightest idea that I was going to take revenge.

325
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:49.221
I threatened him just a bit

326
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:51.221
and he started talking away..

327
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:53.721
The motive for him killing my father and the others

328
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.621
was the topic that was brought up when they were playing mahjong,

329
00:16:55.621 --> 00:16:57.221
"The perfect crime..."

330
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:58.421
They were talking about

331
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:02.421
whether they could steal a gun from the police box.

332
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.121
They had split opinions,

333
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:05.921
but Hiramune decided to actually do it

334
00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:10.121
and prove that a perfect crime could indeed be committed.

335
00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:12.821
However, although he thought that everyone would praise him

336
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:14.821
the doctor and the assistant professor despised him

337
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:18.421
saying that they couldn't continue playing mahjong with a criminal.

338
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.821
Thinking that it would affect his future

339
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:22.721
if what he did were to be exposed, he said he killed them.

340
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:25.121
Although as a joke,

341
00:17:25.121 --> 00:17:28.621
my father urged him to commit the perfect crime as well.

342
00:17:28.621 --> 00:17:30.921
So felt that he also responsible and didn't say anything for a while.

343
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:32.121
But five years later,

344
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.621
my father suggested that they turn themselves in to the police.

345
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:38.221
That's why he said he shut my father up the same way he did the others.

346
00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:40.921
So, what shall I do now?

347
00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:44.621
I'd probably be caught right away even if I took your car and fled.

348
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:49.921
That's my cell phone.

349
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:53.121
It's a call from your girlfriend, officer?

350
00:17:53.121 --> 00:17:55.521
Good timing, tell her to come here.

351
00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:57.321
"Miwako Sato" -I'll use her as hostage.

352
00:17:57.321 --> 00:17:59.421
Why? Don't worry.

353
00:17:59.421 --> 00:18:03.121
If I get to flee safely, I'll let her go free.

354
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:06.921
Hurry up and answer the phone.

355
00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:08.121
I'm sure you already know.

356
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:10.521
Don't say anything. If you do, I'm firing this gun.

357
00:18:12.821 --> 00:18:16.221
I guess my cell phone broke.

358
00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:19.421
I guess I'm the only hostage left.

359
00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.421
Why you...

360
00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:26.221
What? The suspect is Eiki Nabei?

361
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:31.221
Yes, sir. He's at least most likely the one who killed Mr. Hiramune.

362
00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:35.121
I can't get hold of Officer Takagi who went to pick him up.

363
00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:37.121
Please send a back up crew to him immediately.

364
00:18:37.121 --> 00:18:38.821
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

365
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:40.621
Calling all officers.

366
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:42.721
Head for the Nabei residence on the double.

367
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:46.621
There's a possibility that the suspect has possession of Takagi's gun.

368
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:50.021
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him.

369
00:18:50.021 --> 00:18:53.921
Listen! Life is lost in a split second.

370
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:56.221
Officer Takagi.

371
00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:03.521
Why you...

372
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:05.821
How dare you!

373
00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:13.821
Darn.

374
00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:15.321
You asked for it.

375
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.421
Darn. Dogs...

376
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:20.421
They've figured it out.

377
00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:22.721
No, Officer Sato?

378
00:19:24.321 --> 00:19:27.021
No. Don't come in now.

379
00:19:34.821 --> 00:19:37.021
Officer Sato...

380
00:19:39.621 --> 00:19:40.721
Oh, no.

381
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:43.421
Officer Takagi was shot?

382
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.921
"Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital"

383
00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:51.321
What?

384
00:19:51.321 --> 00:19:52.321
So...

385
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:56.021
it turned out the way it usually does in movies and dramas.

386
00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:57.921
No.

387
00:19:57.921 --> 00:20:00.221
Why does Officer Takagi have to die

388
00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:02.921
just because we promised to go to the hot spring together?

389
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:03.921
Hot spring?

390
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:06.421
Officer Takagi!

391
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:07.421
Oh, no, I mean...

392
00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:09.021
You know, the usual?

393
00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:11.221
The evidence that he coincidentally put inside his pocket

394
00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:12.721
during the investigation

395
00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:15.821
saved his life from the culprit's bullet.

396
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:18.621
The mahjong tile.

397
00:20:18.621 --> 00:20:20.121
Come to think of it,

398
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:23.121
he was putting one inside his chest pocket at the mahjong parlor.

399
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:28.121
Thanks to Officer Takagi knocking down Eiki Nabei despite being shot at,

400
00:20:28.121 --> 00:20:30.421
the officer who burst into the room was able to nab Nabei

401
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:32.421
without getting hurt.

402
00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:34.521
I guess it can be said that Eiki was also a victim of this case,

403
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:36.621
which pushed him to do what he did.

404
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:38.521
Then, how is Officer Takagi?

405
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:40.221
He's gone through treatment

406
00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:42.621
and is sleeping in his room now.

407
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:44.321
He's fast asleep.

408
00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:09.321
What was the meaning of that whistling?

409
00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:11.021
The feeling of the composer,

410
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:12.621
"Let's stay the we are" was weaved into the song.

411
00:22:12.621 --> 00:22:16.621
In other words, Hiramune wanted to continue the deduction battles

412
00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:19.621
that they had continued for two years,

413
00:22:19.621 --> 00:22:22.821
and that's why Hiramune Doji is thought to have whistled that tune,

414
00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:24.821
according to Superintendent Matsumoto.

415
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:26.521
I see.

416
00:22:26.521 --> 00:22:28.021
Well, but...

417
00:22:28.021 --> 00:22:29.321
With this wound,

418
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:32.521
we can't possibly go to the hot spring that we promised to go together.

419
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:34.921
You mean that promise was still valid?

420
00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:38.621
Yes. I mean you were just great

421
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:40.321
so I was looking forward to it.

422
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:42.621
But, too bad I guess.

423
00:22:42.621 --> 00:22:45.821
I always end up like this, don't I?

424
00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:50.021
Even back during the bomb explosion case

425
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:52.221
and the Hammer man case.

426
00:22:52.221 --> 00:22:53.421
I'm almost about to make it,

427
00:22:53.421 --> 00:22:55.521
but can't seem to make it through.

428
00:23:00.621 --> 00:23:02.221
Where's Takagi's room?

429
00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:04.521
I think it's room 304.

430
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:07.921
Hot spring. Hot spring?

431
00:23:07.921 --> 00:23:10.921
You can't seem to make it through for what?

432
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:12.021
Oh, no.

433
00:23:12.021 --> 00:23:14.221
Well, something gets in the way and...

434
00:23:14.221 --> 00:23:15.921
"Wataru Takagi"

435
00:23:15.921 --> 00:23:17.621
Wait!

436
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:19.521
Conan?

437
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:22.721
Officer Takagi, just drank his tranquilizer a while ago.

438
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:24.421
And he just fell asleep.

439
00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:26.321
Maybe it's better...

440
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:27.921
Not to wake him.

441
00:23:27.921 --> 00:23:29.921
I think you should come back later.

442
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:31.321
I see.

443
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:33.621
Let's come again in the evening.

444
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:35.221
I guess so.

445
00:23:57.221 --> 00:24:00.421
So, now we get to go to the hot spring with them.

446
00:24:00.421 --> 00:24:01.821
Yes.

447
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:04.421
No, I don't think so.

448
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:08.821
A haunted house?

449
00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:11.421
I hear that a weird man is living there.

450
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:15.721
This seems to call for an investigation.

451
00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:18.121
To be made by the Youth Detective Squad.

452
00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:19.921
What happened to the name plate?

453
00:24:19.921 --> 00:24:21.721
It's not here.

454
00:24:21.721 --> 00:24:26.121
I wonder why he moved into the haunted house.

455
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.021
Let's go check.

456
00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:30.321
Mysteries gotta be solved.

457
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:31.921
Next Conan,

458
00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:35.721
"The Secret of The Vanished Masterpiece".

459
00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:52.321
Ready, start.

460
00:24:52.321 --> 00:24:54.121
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:55.921
"Kudo" -"Name plate".

462
00:24:55.921 --> 00:24:57.221
The nameplate at my house says "Yoshida".

463
00:24:57.221 --> 00:24:58.321
What about you, Conan?

464
00:24:58.321 --> 00:24:59.321
Mouri's written.

465
00:24:59.321 --> 00:25:00.721
Free-loaders sure have it tough.
