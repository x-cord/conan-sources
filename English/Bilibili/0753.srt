1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,640
You mean you're the strongest in the Karate club?

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,840
Yes, Yasuko!

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,540
She easily kicks over the guys too!

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,340
Hey, Yayoi. That's taking it too far!

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,540
-"Yasuko Kawakami (25)" -Wow! A master of Karate!

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,440
No. I'm not.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,840
-"Yayoi Yajima (21)" -Well, as a superior in the same Karate club

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,540
that's something I can really boast about.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,940
Oh, no. It's already this late.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,740
I've got to take a bath.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,840
I guess I'll be going too, then.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,940
Stay a while longer now that you're here.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,540
They're coming to pick you up too, aren't they?

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,240
Yes. Well...

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,840
If so, why not?

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,740
After all, we got to know each other too.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,040
That's true.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm back.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,540
Oh, Welcome back, Mr. Suzuki.

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,740
Thanks.

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,740
She's Ran Mouri, an underclassman.

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,340
-"Hidehisa Suzuki (26)" -Hello.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,740
Hi. I'm Suzuki.

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,940
That's right. Would you like some cake too, Mr. Suzuki?

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,540
Is it okay if I have some?

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm a Peeping Tom, you know.

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,640
Nobody thinks you are.

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,540
It's better to eat it 15 minutes after it's taken out of the refrigerator,

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,140
so hold on a little while more, okay?

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,540
I'm home.

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,140
Welcome back.

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,940
My...

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,840
-"Katsuko Kano (25)" -Mr. Suzuki, you're still here?

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,740
The landlord told you to move out as soon as you can, right?

35
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,840
You're the one who lied and told him,

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,540
I was peeping at you guys.

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,640
Well, but it's much easier to do things with only girls around.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,740
The nerve!

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,140
Hey! A guest is here!

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,440
Katsuko, please cut it out already.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,340
Oh, Yayoi.

42
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,240
What makes you think you can say such things to me?

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,840
Well... It's fine.

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,540
I've got to practice tap dancing before taking a bath.

45
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,740
Katsuko...

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
What?

47
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,440
Like I've been telling you from before,

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,540
will you please lessen your tap dancing practice?

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,540
My room's right below yours, you see?

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,240
That's why...

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh... Your cake...

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,340
You like cake, don't you, Katsuko?

53
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,940
What? Trying to humour me?

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,240
-No... -I guess later then.

55
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,040
I'm going to take a bath then.

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,340
Okay.

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm sorry, Ran.

58
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,540
For making you feel uncomfortable.

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,540
Oh, don't be.

60
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh, it's okay.

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,940
Mr. Suzuki is not a Peeping Tom.

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,040
Katsuko's just going around saying that.

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,640
Never mind that already.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,440
I'll have a talk with her and settle things later.

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
Thank you for the cake!

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,340
I'll eat it in my room.

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,440
Make yourself at home.

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Oh, thank you.

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,740
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

70
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

71
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,440
A shocking incident at a share house.

72
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
What is the premeditated alibi trick?

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

74
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,040
His name is Detective Conan.

76
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,019
"The Blind Spot in the Share House"

77
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,719
It's not all that easy living in a share house, is it?

78
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:08,419
When I first came here, I thought it was quite fashionable.

79
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,219
Because the door of this shared space is made of glass

80
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:15,219
and a foliage plant is decorated here too.

81
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:18,219
It's been renovated so that anyone can come in here

82
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,019
and feel at home.

83
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,319
Well, after all, we're strangers living under the same roof.

84
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,619
So, we've got our worries too.

85
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,519
We've got a lot of rules to follow too.

86
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,619
Rules?

87
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,719
Yes, take a look at the back of the chair.

88
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,819
"Guest"

89
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,519
Like posting seals on all our belongings.

90
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,919
-"Guest" -True.

91
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,819
It was a nice bath.

92
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,719
I'll go take a bath too then.

93
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,119
Okay.

94
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,519
And? What were you talking about?

95
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:54,019
About you, Yayoi, like you forget to throw out the garbage.

96
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,419
I don't mean to though.

97
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,019
You seem to have fixed schedules for cleaning chores and bath time.

98
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,319
There's even a whiteboard for messages too.

99
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,519
It seems like a lot of work.

100
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,319
Yes, but, compared to the average rental, it's much cheaper.

101
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,919
That's why nobody wants to leave.

102
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,519
Oh, Yasuko.

103
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,119
Katsuko's cake?

104
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,919
Okay.

105
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,519
Okay, if she doesn't come down in 15 minutes,

106
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,419
I'll put it back in the fridge.

107
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,719
I'll help you, Yayoi.

108
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,719
Don't worry about it. I'm just doing the dishes.

109
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:35,519
You're a guest, you know.

110
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,819
Is something the matter?

111
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,819
No. Not really.

112
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:50,419
Did something happen to that person called Katsuko?

113
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,019
Maybe, she didn't come to eat it.

114
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,819
I borrowed money from her...

115
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,519
Money?

116
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,919
Is that right?

117
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,619
Since your father suddenly passed away...

118
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:18,519
My brother is still in Junior High School, so finances are needed.

119
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,419
I didn't want to burden anyone to fend for me.

120
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,119
But, no problem.

121
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:26,819
I'm making do with my scholarship and part-time job, you see.

122
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,019
Katsuko didn't come.

123
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,119
Is that so?

124
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,819
She really does whatever she feels like, doesn't she?

125
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,419
Maybe it's them.

126
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,919
The two that came to get you, right?

127
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,919
Yes!

128
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,419
Sorry.

129
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,219
I couldn't get here any earlier.

130
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,219
Let's go home, Ran.

131
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,319
Yayoi, Yasuko, thank you very much.

132
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,819
Please come again.

133
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,019
Sure.

134
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,619
What's wrong? What happened?

135
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:00,919
Mr. Suzuki?

136
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,219
Inside. Katsuko's...

137
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,719
The victim is Ms. Katsuko Kano, age 25.

138
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,819
The murder weapon is unmistakably the knife that was found on the site,

139
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,219
but there were no prints found.

140
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:30,219
The estimated time of death is between 7:15 pm and 7:45 pm.

141
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,319
And...

142
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,819
sleeping drug was found from the contents in the PET bottle

143
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:37,219
that was on the floor of the site.

144
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:41,619
I see. Putting her to sleep and then stabbing her to death.

145
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:44,719
Mr. Suzuki, since you were the first to discover the body,

146
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:47,219
please explain how you ended up finding it.

147
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,519
Oh, yes.

148
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,019
This morning there was a message

149
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,819
written on that message board from Katsuko to me.

150
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:58,319
I'll go over to your room before 8:00 pm tonight.

151
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,419
Let's get things settled.

152
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,419
There's nothing like that written anywhere.

153
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,519
Has anyone else seen that message?

154
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,419
It was written on the message board to keep it a secret!

155
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:13,519
That's why I erased it.

156
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,319
Besides, I'm always the last one out of the house,

157
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,319
so Katsuko probably wrote it knowing that I was alone in the house.

158
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:23,819
And?

159
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,119
Just as was written,

160
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,119
I was waiting in my room all the while,

161
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:31,719
but, Katsuko didn't come even after 8:00 pm so...

162
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:34,619
I went to her room

163
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:37,719
and found Katsuko on the bed.

164
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,119
I see.

165
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,819
It's true. Please believe me!

166
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,719
No!

167
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,019
I didn't do it!

168
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,219
Right, Yayoi, Yasuko?

169
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:07,819
Do you both have something in mind?

170
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:12,319
The fact is, recently Katsuko and Mr. Suzuki were always at each other.

171
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:17,419
Even tonight, before going back to their rooms had a slight argument.

172
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,219
Ran, is that right?

173
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,419
-Yes. -Not only me!

174
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,719
Neither of you guys like Katsuko, did you?

175
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,319
Please wait!

176
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:30,019
I don't think they're involved with the case.

177
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,919
Ran, what makes you say that?

178
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,919
From between 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm,

179
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,919
both of them either took a bath as scheduled

180
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,719
or was taking with me here.

181
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,019
As scheduled?

182
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,419
It's fixed, isn't it?

183
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:48,119
Your bath time because this is a share house.

184
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:52,319
Right. Besides, I only got up once to use the restroom,

185
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,219
but sitting here right through otherwise.

186
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:59,319
From here, I can see the corridor through the glass door.

187
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,819
The sliding glass door...

188
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:03,919
It's true that you can see right through it.

189
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,319
In order to go upstairs from the bath tub...

190
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:09,619
You can't go there unless you walk along that corridor.

191
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,419
I'm sure that no one walked by

192
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,019
while Yasuko was taking a bath.

193
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,219
I see. So the two girls have alibis.

194
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:21,219
Then, Mr. Suzuki,

195
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:24,219
I hope you don't mind going upstairs once again

196
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:28,819
to explain how you found the corpse at the scene?

197
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,619
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:35,119
Names must be written on all personal belongings.

199
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,119
Come to think of it,

200
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:40,419
there's a name written on the PET bottle found on the floor of the site.

201
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:42,219
Would you like something to drink?

202
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,219
Oh, well, no thanks.

203
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:46,319
No need to be hesitant.

204
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,419
Is that cake Katsuko's?

205
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,719
That's right.

206
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,919
I took it out of the fridge and got it ready for her.

207
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,819
Because Yasuko asked me to...

208
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,719
I was naked, you see.

209
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,519
But, she didn't come to eat it after all.

210
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,719
So I put it back in the fridge.

211
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,519
It's best 15 minutes after it's taken out of the fridge.

212
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,419
We wanted her to eat it when most delicious.

213
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,319
I get it.

214
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,419
What's up, Conan?

215
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,919
Nothing.

216
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,419
Was there anything else out of the ordinary?

217
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,419
Out of the ordinary?

218
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,519
Oh, now that you mentioned it.

219
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,419
Yayoi, you tilted your head

220
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,119
when you were washing dishes, didn't you?

221
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,919
I'll help you, Yayoi.

222
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,019
Don't worry about it. I'm just doing the dishes.

223
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,919
You're a guest, you know.

224
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,319
Oh... Usually when someone's taking a bath

225
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:47,019
the water doesn't flow as much but...

226
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,919
the water was flowing out as usual at that time.

227
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,019
The bath tub's that way, right?

228
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,219
Wait. Conan.

229
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,019
Over here too.

230
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,619
It's been wiped off and traces of it being stepped on?

231
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:12,319
What's the matter?

232
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,319
What's this?

233
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,119
Oh, darn it.

234
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,519
It's shampoo.

235
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,519
When I poured a new one in today, I spilled some.

236
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,519
I thought I wiped it clean

237
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,519
but I guess not.

238
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,519
A window.

239
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:39,319
The dining room's in clear view.

240
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,219
So that means...

241
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,819
Why is this area lighter than others?

242
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,919
Because there was a picture there before

243
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,419
but the landlord took it away yesterday.

244
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:53,819
This is?

245
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,219
Inspector Megure!

246
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,219
Please come here! Quick!

247
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,211
From inside Mr. Suzuki's shoe box,

248
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:14,211
we found this towel.

249
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:17,811
I see, so that's the story.

250
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:21,111
So as I thought. Mr. Suzuki, you are the killer!

251
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:25,811
You were on bad terms with Katsuko to begin with.

252
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:31,511
But, tonight you blew your top and killed Katsuko upstairs.

253
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,811
At that time, you wrapped the handle of the knife with this towel

254
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,311
to avoid getting your prints on it!

255
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,811
I'll bet you meant to keep this hidden and get rid of it later.

256
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,711
This is it, no, Inspector?

257
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,311
Yes. Mr. Katsuhiko Suzuki.

258
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:50,211
I would like you to come to the station with us as a prime suspect.

259
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:51,611
I didn't do it!

260
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,711
It's not me.

261
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,911
Wrong! He's not the killer!

262
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,611
The killer is one of these two.

263
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:08,111
So, that's it!

264
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,411
Please wait, everyone!

265
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:20,211
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me...

266
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:24,311
I think it's too early to conclude that Mr. Suzuki is the killer.

267
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:27,511
But, Mr. Mouri you just...

268
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,511
I'm totally ashamed of myself.

269
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:34,911
It's more than apparent just looking at Mr. Suzuki and yet...

270
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,511
Please recall the scene of the crime.

271
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,611
Katsuko was killed by a slashed artery

272
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:43,911
and there was blood splattered everywhere.

273
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,611
And yet please look at him.

274
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,111
Mr. Suzuki's sweatshirt is stark white.

275
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:52,911
Could the killer get away without any blood splattering?

276
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,911
Maybe he pretended to find the corpse after he changed?

277
00:15:56,911 --> 00:16:01,211
If so, those clothes should've been found by now.

278
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,411
He didn't have time to get rid of them you see.

279
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,111
True.

280
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,311
If so, who on earth's the killer?

281
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,511
This what the killer did.

282
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,011
First, the killer pretends to be Katsuko,

283
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:17,211
and writes a message to Mr. Suzuki on the message board.

284
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:21,211
In order to nail Mr. Suzuki in his room during the time of the crime,

285
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:24,211
and get rid of his alibi.

286
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,711
Then the killer,

287
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:30,311
at the time of the crime sneaks out of the bath tub and goes upstairs.

288
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,411
Wait a minute there, Mr. Mouri.

289
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:33,911
According to Ran,

290
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:37,811
nobody passed the corridor during the time of the crime.

291
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:39,111
Conan!

292
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:42,011
Yes! Officer Takagi!

293
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:45,711
There's a large planter in front of that door over there, isn't there?

294
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,511
Try looking below, will you?

295
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:49,411
There's a trace of it having been moved, right?

296
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:54,511
-Yes. -Can you move it a bit over towards the door?

297
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:55,511
Like this?

298
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,511
Then, will you go out to the corridor and close the door?

299
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:00,111
Roger.

300
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:03,511
Ran, please go over to the fridge

301
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:07,211
and open the door of the fridge when Pops signals you to.

302
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:08,811
Okay, I got it.

303
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,811
Please come here, everybody!

304
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:16,711
Please watch Officer Takagi closely.

305
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:19,311
Okay, Ran. Open the door of the fridge.

306
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:20,611
Okay.

307
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:24,011
This is...

308
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,311
How about it?

309
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,311
Officer Takagi disappeared from view

310
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,911
from where Ran was sitting.

311
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:34,611
I heard from Conan that during the time of the crime,

312
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:37,911
the fridge door was opened twice.

313
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:43,711
In order to take out and put back Katsuko's cake.

314
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,611
Before committing the crime,

315
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:50,411
the killer moved that planter when Ran got up to go to the restroom.

316
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:53,711
Then, snuck out of the bath tub.

317
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:56,411
I've got evidence of this too.

318
00:17:56,411 --> 00:18:01,511
The killer stepped on the spilled shampoo in the bathroom.

319
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,711
Traces of this were left in the corridor.

320
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:08,511
Then during this short time that the fridge door was opened,

321
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,911
the killer head for Katsuko's room.

322
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:15,211
There, Katusko who was drugged with sleeping medicine,

323
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,511
was fast asleep.

324
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:19,811
The killer who snuck in.

325
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,311
After committing the crime

326
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:26,411
and putting the blood smeared towel

327
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:28,911
into Mr. Suzuki's shoe box.

328
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:34,311
Then the killer ran again when the cake was put back into the fridge.

329
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:38,211
All you had to do was put the planter back in place.

330
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:41,011
Wait, Dad, are you saying that I...

331
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:45,811
Ran, you were used to establish an alibi.

332
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:48,811
Because guests will always sit where you did.

333
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:52,211
Wait. I'm the one who opened the fridge door.

334
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,311
Which means that the killer is...

335
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:55,811
Yasuko?

336
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,611
I'm the killer?

337
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:01,211
Don't be ridiculous! Wrong!

338
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:02,911
Huh? Miss...

339
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:05,011
Did you hurt your shoulder?

340
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,811
Blood's coming out.

341
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,511
That is indeed the evidence

342
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:14,511
that proves you went up and down the stairs.

343
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:18,011
Take a look at that window facing the stairs.

344
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:21,011
Although it's situated in a high place,

345
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:23,211
when Yasuko committed the crime,

346
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,811
she didn't want to be seen.

347
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,511
That's why she sank down low

348
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:30,711
and when she tried to straighten up again.

349
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,411
Right.

350
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:35,211
On the wall right beyond the window,

351
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:37,311
there was a nail sticking out

352
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:39,411
just where her shoulder was.

353
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,811
Wait!

354
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:44,911
You said that Mr. Suzuki had no blood splattered on him, didn't you?

355
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:49,811
But, Katsuko's blood wasn't on my clothes either!

356
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:53,211
It dawned on me as soon as I saw that wound.

357
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:56,111
Your body was injured because of the nail.

358
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,911
But, your T-shirt now isn't torn.

359
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:03,711
The clothes that you were wearing before probably isn't torn either.

360
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,511
What is the meaning of this?

361
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:11,811
After going to the bath tub you took off all your clothes

362
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,011
and killed Katsuko naked!

363
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:23,811
After that,

364
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:28,311
you wipe of the blood using the towel that you wrapped the knife with,

365
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,911
then being very careful not to leave traces on the floor,

366
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:35,911
you return to the bath tub and shower everything off.

367
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,311
You're wrong! I...

368
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:42,511
If so, let's have the drain of the bath tub checked!

369
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:46,111
I'm sure that Katsuko's blood will be detected!

370
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,811
Yasuko. Why?

371
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,211
Tap...

372
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,511
All the time!

373
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,011
It comes echoing every night!

374
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,511
The sound of her shoes tap dancing!

375
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:06,711
She wouldn't stop no matter how many times I asked her to.

376
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:09,811
I couldn't take it anymore!

377
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,211
For something like that.

378
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:15,411
Then she said...

379
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:18,111
In fact, I feel really good.

380
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:22,011
It's like I'm stepping on the top of your head.

381
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:24,411
So, just put up with it.

382
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:28,011
Because a third rate, plain woman like you

383
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:32,411
can only be of use to me by doing so.

384
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:02,611
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, Dad!

385
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:06,111
I thought up something good!

386
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,311
Why don't we turn our house into a share house?

387
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,011
It'll help make ends meet too.

388
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:12,011
Don't be silly.

389
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:13,311
I see.

390
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:16,211
Too bad when I know this beautiful, money-making career woman

391
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,211
that could do us good.

392
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:21,311
Really too bad.

393
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:24,111
Well, if it's going to help make ends meet.

394
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,311
Really? All right!

395
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,911
-"Eri Kisaki" -I'll attach this on the vacant room then.

396
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:32,611
So now, we can live as a family once again.

397
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,211
I've got to call Mom.

398
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,211
Hey, Ran, don't!

399
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,311
-Give that to me! -Hello, mom.

400
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,811
Give it to me I said!

401
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,011
Wait a second.

402
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:44,811
Her cooking is...

403
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,911
Wait, Ran! Please wait!

404
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:55,811
These are the pictures I printed out.

405
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,111
We're counting on you.

406
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,911
Well, it was 15 years ago.

407
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:03,011
At a different rental villa near here.

408
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:06,411
By the time a police officer who heard of this incident got to the room...

409
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:08,811
Red...

410
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,211
Red?

411
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:12,111
Red...

412
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,711
The bath tub is filled with...

413
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,611
Next Conan,

414
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:20,611
"The Tragedy of the Red Woman (Bath Steam)"

415
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:38,611
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,611
"Tomato".

417
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,011
-No lemon, no melon. -Step on no pets

418
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:45,011
-Stop or pots. -Star or rats.
