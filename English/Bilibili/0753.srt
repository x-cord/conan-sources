1
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.640
You mean you're the strongest in the Karate club?

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.840
Yes, Yasuko!

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.540
She easily kicks over the guys too!

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.340
Hey, Yayoi. That's taking it too far!

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.540
-"Yasuko Kawakami (25)" -Wow! A master of Karate!

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.440
No. I'm not.

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.840
-"Yayoi Yajima (21)" -Well, as a superior in the same Karate club

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.540
that's something I can really boast about.

9
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.940
Oh, no. It's already this late.

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.740
I've got to take a bath.

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.840
I guess I'll be going too, then.

12
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.940
Stay a while longer now that you're here.

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.540
They're coming to pick you up too, aren't they?

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.240
Yes. Well...

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.840
If so, why not?

16
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.740
After all, we got to know each other too.

17
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.040
That's true.

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.040
I'm back.

19
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.540
Oh, Welcome back, Mr. Suzuki.

20
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.740
Thanks.

21
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
She's Ran Mouri, an underclassman.

22
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.340
-"Hidehisa Suzuki (26)" -Hello.

23
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.740
Hi. I'm Suzuki.

24
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.940
That's right. Would you like some cake too, Mr. Suzuki?

25
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.540
Is it okay if I have some?

26
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.840
I'm a Peeping Tom, you know.

27
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.640
Nobody thinks you are.

28
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.540
It's better to eat it 15 minutes after it's taken out of the refrigerator,

29
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.140
so hold on a little while more, okay?

30
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.540
I'm home.

31
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.140
Welcome back.

32
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.940
My...

33
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.840
-"Katsuko Kano (25)" -Mr. Suzuki, you're still here?

34
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.740
The landlord told you to move out as soon as you can, right?

35
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.840
You're the one who lied and told him,

36
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.540
I was peeping at you guys.

37
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.640
Well, but it's much easier to do things with only girls around.

38
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.740
The nerve!

39
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.140
Hey! A guest is here!

40
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440
Katsuko, please cut it out already.

41
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.340
Oh, Yayoi.

42
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.240
What makes you think you can say such things to me?

43
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.840
Well... It's fine.

44
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.540
I've got to practice tap dancing before taking a bath.

45
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.740
Katsuko...

46
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.940
What?

47
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.440
Like I've been telling you from before,

48
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.540
will you please lessen your tap dancing practice?

49
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
My room's right below yours, you see?

50
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.240
That's why...

51
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.040
Oh... Your cake...

52
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.340
You like cake, don't you, Katsuko?

53
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.940
What? Trying to humour me?

54
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.240
-No... -I guess later then.

55
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.040
I'm going to take a bath then.

56
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.340
Okay.

57
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340
I'm sorry, Ran.

58
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.540
For making you feel uncomfortable.

59
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.540
Oh, don't be.

60
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.840
Oh, it's okay.

61
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.940
Mr. Suzuki is not a Peeping Tom.

62
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.040
Katsuko's just going around saying that.

63
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.640
Never mind that already.

64
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
I'll have a talk with her and settle things later.

65
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.840
Thank you for the cake!

66
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.340
I'll eat it in my room.

67
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.440
Make yourself at home.

68
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440
Oh, thank you.

69
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.740
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

70
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.740
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

71
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.440
A shocking incident at a share house.

72
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440
What is the premeditated alibi trick?

73
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

74
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

75
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.040
His name is Detective Conan.

76
00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.019
"The Blind Spot in the Share House"

77
00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.719
It's not all that easy living in a share house, is it?

78
00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.419
When I first came here, I thought it was quite fashionable.

79
00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.219
Because the door of this shared space is made of glass

80
00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.219
and a foliage plant is decorated here too.

81
00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.219
It's been renovated so that anyone can come in here

82
00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.019
and feel at home.

83
00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.319
Well, after all, we're strangers living under the same roof.

84
00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.619
So, we've got our worries too.

85
00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:27.519
We've got a lot of rules to follow too.

86
00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.619
Rules?

87
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:31.719
Yes, take a look at the back of the chair.

88
00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.819
"Guest"

89
00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.519
Like posting seals on all our belongings.

90
00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.919
-"Guest" -True.

91
00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.819
It was a nice bath.

92
00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.719
I'll go take a bath too then.

93
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.119
Okay.

94
00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:48.519
And? What were you talking about?

95
00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:54.019
About you, Yayoi, like you forget to throw out the garbage.

96
00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:55.419
I don't mean to though.

97
00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.019
You seem to have fixed schedules for cleaning chores and bath time.

98
00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:02.319
There's even a whiteboard for messages too.

99
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.519
It seems like a lot of work.

100
00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:08.319
Yes, but, compared to the average rental, it's much cheaper.

101
00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.919
That's why nobody wants to leave.

102
00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.519
Oh, Yasuko.

103
00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.119
Katsuko's cake?

104
00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.919
Okay.

105
00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.519
Okay, if she doesn't come down in 15 minutes,

106
00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.419
I'll put it back in the fridge.

107
00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.719
I'll help you, Yayoi.

108
00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.719
Don't worry about it. I'm just doing the dishes.

109
00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:35.519
You're a guest, you know.

110
00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:39.819
Is something the matter?

111
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.819
No. Not really.

112
00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:50.419
Did something happen to that person called Katsuko?

113
00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.019
Maybe, she didn't come to eat it.

114
00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.819
I borrowed money from her...

115
00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:06.519
Money?

116
00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:11.919
Is that right?

117
00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.619
Since your father suddenly passed away...

118
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:18.519
My brother is still in Junior High School, so finances are needed.

119
00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:21.419
I didn't want to burden anyone to fend for me.

120
00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.119
But, no problem.

121
00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:26.819
I'm making do with my scholarship and part-time job, you see.

122
00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.019
Katsuko didn't come.

123
00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:33.119
Is that so?

124
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.819
She really does whatever she feels like, doesn't she?

125
00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:38.419
Maybe it's them.

126
00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:39.919
The two that came to get you, right?

127
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:40.919
Yes!

128
00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.419
Sorry.

129
00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.219
I couldn't get here any earlier.

130
00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.219
Let's go home, Ran.

131
00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:50.319
Yayoi, Yasuko, thank you very much.

132
00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.819
Please come again.

133
00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.019
Sure.

134
00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:59.619
What's wrong? What happened?

135
00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:00.919
Mr. Suzuki?

136
00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.219
Inside. Katsuko's...

137
00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:17.719
The victim is Ms. Katsuko Kano, age 25.

138
00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:21.819
The murder weapon is unmistakably the knife that was found on the site,

139
00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:24.219
but there were no prints found.

140
00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:30.219
The estimated time of death is between 7:15 pm and 7:45 pm.

141
00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:31.319
And...

142
00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:34.819
sleeping drug was found from the contents in the PET bottle

143
00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:37.219
that was on the floor of the site.

144
00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:41.619
I see. Putting her to sleep and then stabbing her to death.

145
00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:44.719
Mr. Suzuki, since you were the first to discover the body,

146
00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:47.219
please explain how you ended up finding it.

147
00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:48.519
Oh, yes.

148
00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:51.019
This morning there was a message

149
00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:54.819
written on that message board from Katsuko to me.

150
00:08:54.819 --> 00:08:58.319
I'll go over to your room before 8:00 pm tonight.

151
00:08:58.319 --> 00:09:01.419
Let's get things settled.

152
00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:04.419
There's nothing like that written anywhere.

153
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:07.519
Has anyone else seen that message?

154
00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:10.419
It was written on the message board to keep it a secret!

155
00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:13.519
That's why I erased it.

156
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:17.319
Besides, I'm always the last one out of the house,

157
00:09:17.319 --> 00:09:22.319
so Katsuko probably wrote it knowing that I was alone in the house.

158
00:09:22.319 --> 00:09:23.819
And?

159
00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:25.119
Just as was written,

160
00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:27.119
I was waiting in my room all the while,

161
00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:31.719
but, Katsuko didn't come even after 8:00 pm so...

162
00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:34.619
I went to her room

163
00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:37.719
and found Katsuko on the bed.

164
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:39.119
I see.

165
00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:41.819
It's true. Please believe me!

166
00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:53.719
No!

167
00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:56.019
I didn't do it!

168
00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:59.219
Right, Yayoi, Yasuko?

169
00:10:01.219 --> 00:10:07.819
Do you both have something in mind?

170
00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:12.319
The fact is, recently Katsuko and Mr. Suzuki were always at each other.

171
00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:17.419
Even tonight, before going back to their rooms had a slight argument.

172
00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:19.219
Ran, is that right?

173
00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:21.419
-Yes. -Not only me!

174
00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:25.719
Neither of you guys like Katsuko, did you?

175
00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:27.319
Please wait!

176
00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:30.019
I don't think they're involved with the case.

177
00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:32.919
Ran, what makes you say that?

178
00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.919
From between 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm,

179
00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:37.919
both of them either took a bath as scheduled

180
00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:40.719
or was taking with me here.

181
00:10:40.719 --> 00:10:42.019
As scheduled?

182
00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:44.419
It's fixed, isn't it?

183
00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:48.119
Your bath time because this is a share house.

184
00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:52.319
Right. Besides, I only got up once to use the restroom,

185
00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:55.219
but sitting here right through otherwise.

186
00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:59.319
From here, I can see the corridor through the glass door.

187
00:10:59.319 --> 00:11:01.819
The sliding glass door...

188
00:11:01.819 --> 00:11:03.919
It's true that you can see right through it.

189
00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:06.319
In order to go upstairs from the bath tub...

190
00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:09.619
You can't go there unless you walk along that corridor.

191
00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:12.419
I'm sure that no one walked by

192
00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:15.019
while Yasuko was taking a bath.

193
00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:19.219
I see. So the two girls have alibis.

194
00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:21.219
Then, Mr. Suzuki,

195
00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:24.219
I hope you don't mind going upstairs once again

196
00:11:24.219 --> 00:11:28.819
to explain how you found the corpse at the scene?

197
00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:30.619
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:35.119
Names must be written on all personal belongings.

199
00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:36.119
Come to think of it,

200
00:11:36.119 --> 00:11:40.419
there's a name written on the PET bottle found on the floor of the site.

201
00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:42.219
Would you like something to drink?

202
00:11:42.219 --> 00:11:44.219
Oh, well, no thanks.

203
00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:46.319
No need to be hesitant.

204
00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:49.419
Is that cake Katsuko's?

205
00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:50.719
That's right.

206
00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:53.919
I took it out of the fridge and got it ready for her.

207
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:56.819
Because Yasuko asked me to...

208
00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:58.719
I was naked, you see.

209
00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:02.519
But, she didn't come to eat it after all.

210
00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:05.719
So I put it back in the fridge.

211
00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:08.519
It's best 15 minutes after it's taken out of the fridge.

212
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:13.419
We wanted her to eat it when most delicious.

213
00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.319
I get it.

214
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.419
What's up, Conan?

215
00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:18.919
Nothing.

216
00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:21.419
Was there anything else out of the ordinary?

217
00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:24.419
Out of the ordinary?

218
00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:26.519
Oh, now that you mentioned it.

219
00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:29.419
Yayoi, you tilted your head

220
00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:32.119
when you were washing dishes, didn't you?

221
00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:33.919
I'll help you, Yayoi.

222
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:36.019
Don't worry about it. I'm just doing the dishes.

223
00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:39.919
You're a guest, you know.

224
00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:44.319
Oh... Usually when someone's taking a bath

225
00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:47.019
the water doesn't flow as much but...

226
00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:49.919
the water was flowing out as usual at that time.

227
00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:52.019
The bath tub's that way, right?

228
00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:54.219
Wait. Conan.

229
00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.019
Over here too.

230
00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:10.619
It's been wiped off and traces of it being stepped on?

231
00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:12.319
What's the matter?

232
00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:16.319
What's this?

233
00:13:17.419 --> 00:13:19.119
Oh, darn it.

234
00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:20.519
It's shampoo.

235
00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:24.519
When I poured a new one in today, I spilled some.

236
00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:26.519
I thought I wiped it clean

237
00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:28.519
but I guess not.

238
00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:34.519
A window.

239
00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:39.319
The dining room's in clear view.

240
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:43.219
So that means...

241
00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:45.819
Why is this area lighter than others?

242
00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:48.919
Because there was a picture there before

243
00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:52.419
but the landlord took it away yesterday.

244
00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:53.819
This is?

245
00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:55.219
Inspector Megure!

246
00:13:55.219 --> 00:13:57.219
Please come here! Quick!

247
00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:11.211
From inside Mr. Suzuki's shoe box,

248
00:14:11.211 --> 00:14:14.211
we found this towel.

249
00:14:14.211 --> 00:14:17.811
I see, so that's the story.

250
00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:21.111
So as I thought. Mr. Suzuki, you are the killer!

251
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:25.811
You were on bad terms with Katsuko to begin with.

252
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:31.511
But, tonight you blew your top and killed Katsuko upstairs.

253
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.811
At that time, you wrapped the handle of the knife with this towel

254
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:37.311
to avoid getting your prints on it!

255
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:41.811
I'll bet you meant to keep this hidden and get rid of it later.

256
00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:43.711
This is it, no, Inspector?

257
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:46.311
Yes. Mr. Katsuhiko Suzuki.

258
00:14:46.311 --> 00:14:50.211
I would like you to come to the station with us as a prime suspect.

259
00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:51.611
I didn't do it!

260
00:14:51.611 --> 00:14:53.711
It's not me.

261
00:14:53.711 --> 00:14:56.911
Wrong! He's not the killer!

262
00:14:56.911 --> 00:14:59.611
The killer is one of these two.

263
00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.111
So, that's it!

264
00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:17.411
Please wait, everyone!

265
00:15:17.411 --> 00:15:20.211
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me...

266
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:24.311
I think it's too early to conclude that Mr. Suzuki is the killer.

267
00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:27.511
But, Mr. Mouri you just...

268
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:30.511
I'm totally ashamed of myself.

269
00:15:30.511 --> 00:15:34.911
It's more than apparent just looking at Mr. Suzuki and yet...

270
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:37.511
Please recall the scene of the crime.

271
00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:40.611
Katsuko was killed by a slashed artery

272
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:43.911
and there was blood splattered everywhere.

273
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:45.611
And yet please look at him.

274
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.111
Mr. Suzuki's sweatshirt is stark white.

275
00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:52.911
Could the killer get away without any blood splattering?

276
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.911
Maybe he pretended to find the corpse after he changed?

277
00:15:56.911 --> 00:16:01.211
If so, those clothes should've been found by now.

278
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.411
He didn't have time to get rid of them you see.

279
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:05.111
True.

280
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:08.311
If so, who on earth's the killer?

281
00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:10.511
This what the killer did.

282
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.011
First, the killer pretends to be Katsuko,

283
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:17.211
and writes a message to Mr. Suzuki on the message board.

284
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:21.211
In order to nail Mr. Suzuki in his room during the time of the crime,

285
00:16:21.211 --> 00:16:24.211
and get rid of his alibi.

286
00:16:24.211 --> 00:16:25.711
Then the killer,

287
00:16:25.711 --> 00:16:30.311
at the time of the crime sneaks out of the bath tub and goes upstairs.

288
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:32.411
Wait a minute there, Mr. Mouri.

289
00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:33.911
According to Ran,

290
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:37.811
nobody passed the corridor during the time of the crime.

291
00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:39.111
Conan!

292
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:42.011
Yes! Officer Takagi!

293
00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:45.711
There's a large planter in front of that door over there, isn't there?

294
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:47.511
Try looking below, will you?

295
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:49.411
There's a trace of it having been moved, right?

296
00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:54.511
-Yes. -Can you move it a bit over towards the door?

297
00:16:54.511 --> 00:16:55.511
Like this?

298
00:16:55.511 --> 00:16:58.511
Then, will you go out to the corridor and close the door?

299
00:16:58.511 --> 00:17:00.111
Roger.

300
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:03.511
Ran, please go over to the fridge

301
00:17:03.511 --> 00:17:07.211
and open the door of the fridge when Pops signals you to.

302
00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:08.811
Okay, I got it.

303
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:10.811
Please come here, everybody!

304
00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:16.711
Please watch Officer Takagi closely.

305
00:17:16.711 --> 00:17:19.311
Okay, Ran. Open the door of the fridge.

306
00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:20.611
Okay.

307
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:24.011
This is...

308
00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:25.311
How about it?

309
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:27.311
Officer Takagi disappeared from view

310
00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:30.911
from where Ran was sitting.

311
00:17:30.911 --> 00:17:34.611
I heard from Conan that during the time of the crime,

312
00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:37.911
the fridge door was opened twice.

313
00:17:39.511 --> 00:17:43.711
In order to take out and put back Katsuko's cake.

314
00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:45.611
Before committing the crime,

315
00:17:45.611 --> 00:17:50.411
the killer moved that planter when Ran got up to go to the restroom.

316
00:17:50.411 --> 00:17:53.711
Then, snuck out of the bath tub.

317
00:17:53.711 --> 00:17:56.411
I've got evidence of this too.

318
00:17:56.411 --> 00:18:01.511
The killer stepped on the spilled shampoo in the bathroom.

319
00:18:01.511 --> 00:18:04.711
Traces of this were left in the corridor.

320
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:08.511
Then during this short time that the fridge door was opened,

321
00:18:08.511 --> 00:18:11.911
the killer head for Katsuko's room.

322
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:15.211
There, Katusko who was drugged with sleeping medicine,

323
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:17.511
was fast asleep.

324
00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:19.811
The killer who snuck in.

325
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:25.311
After committing the crime

326
00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:26.411
and putting the blood smeared towel

327
00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:28.911
into Mr. Suzuki's shoe box.

328
00:18:28.911 --> 00:18:34.311
Then the killer ran again when the cake was put back into the fridge.

329
00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:38.211
All you had to do was put the planter back in place.

330
00:18:38.211 --> 00:18:41.011
Wait, Dad, are you saying that I...

331
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:45.811
Ran, you were used to establish an alibi.

332
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:48.811
Because guests will always sit where you did.

333
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.211
Wait. I'm the one who opened the fridge door.

334
00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:54.311
Which means that the killer is...

335
00:18:54.311 --> 00:18:55.811
Yasuko?

336
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:58.611
I'm the killer?

337
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:01.211
Don't be ridiculous! Wrong!

338
00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:02.911
Huh? Miss...

339
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:05.011
Did you hurt your shoulder?

340
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:06.811
Blood's coming out.

341
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.511
That is indeed the evidence

342
00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:14.511
that proves you went up and down the stairs.

343
00:19:14.511 --> 00:19:18.011
Take a look at that window facing the stairs.

344
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:21.011
Although it's situated in a high place,

345
00:19:21.011 --> 00:19:23.211
when Yasuko committed the crime,

346
00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:25.811
she didn't want to be seen.

347
00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:27.511
That's why she sank down low

348
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:30.711
and when she tried to straighten up again.

349
00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:33.411
Right.

350
00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:35.211
On the wall right beyond the window,

351
00:19:35.211 --> 00:19:37.311
there was a nail sticking out

352
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:39.411
just where her shoulder was.

353
00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:40.811
Wait!

354
00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:44.911
You said that Mr. Suzuki had no blood splattered on him, didn't you?

355
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:49.811
But, Katsuko's blood wasn't on my clothes either!

356
00:19:49.811 --> 00:19:53.211
It dawned on me as soon as I saw that wound.

357
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:56.111
Your body was injured because of the nail.

358
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:58.911
But, your T-shirt now isn't torn.

359
00:19:58.911 --> 00:20:03.711
The clothes that you were wearing before probably isn't torn either.

360
00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:06.511
What is the meaning of this?

361
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:11.811
After going to the bath tub you took off all your clothes

362
00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:15.011
and killed Katsuko naked!

363
00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:23.811
After that,

364
00:20:23.811 --> 00:20:28.311
you wipe of the blood using the towel that you wrapped the knife with,

365
00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:31.911
then being very careful not to leave traces on the floor,

366
00:20:31.911 --> 00:20:35.911
you return to the bath tub and shower everything off.

367
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:38.311
You're wrong! I...

368
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:42.511
If so, let's have the drain of the bath tub checked!

369
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:46.111
I'm sure that Katsuko's blood will be detected!

370
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.811
Yasuko. Why?

371
00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:57.211
Tap...

372
00:20:57.211 --> 00:20:58.511
All the time!

373
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:01.011
It comes echoing every night!

374
00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.511
The sound of her shoes tap dancing!

375
00:21:03.511 --> 00:21:06.711
She wouldn't stop no matter how many times I asked her to.

376
00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:09.811
I couldn't take it anymore!

377
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:13.211
For something like that.

378
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.411
Then she said...

379
00:21:15.411 --> 00:21:18.111
In fact, I feel really good.

380
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:22.011
It's like I'm stepping on the top of your head.

381
00:21:22.011 --> 00:21:24.411
So, just put up with it.

382
00:21:24.411 --> 00:21:28.011
Because a third rate, plain woman like you

383
00:21:28.011 --> 00:21:32.411
can only be of use to me by doing so.

384
00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:02.611
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, Dad!

385
00:23:02.611 --> 00:23:06.111
I thought up something good!

386
00:23:06.111 --> 00:23:08.311
Why don't we turn our house into a share house?

387
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:10.011
It'll help make ends meet too.

388
00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:12.011
Don't be silly.

389
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:13.311
I see.

390
00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:16.211
Too bad when I know this beautiful, money-making career woman

391
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.211
that could do us good.

392
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:21.311
Really too bad.

393
00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:24.111
Well, if it's going to help make ends meet.

394
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:26.311
Really? All right!

395
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:29.911
-"Eri Kisaki" -I'll attach this on the vacant room then.

396
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:32.611
So now, we can live as a family once again.

397
00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.211
I've got to call Mom.

398
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:36.211
Hey, Ran, don't!

399
00:23:38.011 --> 00:23:39.311
-Give that to me! -Hello, mom.

400
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:40.811
Give it to me I said!

401
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:42.011
Wait a second.

402
00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:44.811
Her cooking is...

403
00:23:46.411 --> 00:23:48.911
Wait, Ran! Please wait!

404
00:23:53.311 --> 00:23:55.811
These are the pictures I printed out.

405
00:23:55.811 --> 00:23:57.111
We're counting on you.

406
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.911
Well, it was 15 years ago.

407
00:23:59.911 --> 00:24:03.011
At a different rental villa near here.

408
00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:06.411
By the time a police officer who heard of this incident got to the room...

409
00:24:07.611 --> 00:24:08.811
Red...

410
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:10.211
Red?

411
00:24:10.211 --> 00:24:12.111
Red...

412
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:13.711
The bath tub is filled with...

413
00:24:15.211 --> 00:24:16.611
Next Conan,

414
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:20.611
"The Tragedy of the Red Woman (Bath Steam)"

415
00:24:36.211 --> 00:24:38.611
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:40.611
"Tomato".

417
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:42.011
-No lemon, no melon. -Step on no pets

418
00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:45.011
-Stop or pots. -Star or rats.
