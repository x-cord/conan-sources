1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,140
The serial car thefts

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,540
that Yumi of the Metropolitan Police Department had named as such,

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,140
was a malicious case in which the key was tampered with,

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,740
the car then broken into and the word "Die" was written

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,340
on the ceiling of the car.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,640
Officer Chiba's car was also attacked,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,740
and the new policewoman, Naeko Miike, who came along with Yumi

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,040
after they were contacted about the incident,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,940
turned out to be Officer Chiba's first love.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,340
There was a time when we looked for

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,240
a video that she was shown on at Teitan Elementary School,

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,740
together with Officer Chiba in the past.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,440
It seems that Officer Chiba was totally oblivious to the fact

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,140
that the woman officer in front of him was his first love.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,740
So, we thought up a plan to make Officer Chiba and Naeko

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,840
investigate the car theft case together.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,740
If they both work together,

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,240
he would most likely remember her.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,140
But, in the basement parking lot that they were investigating,

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,140
there was a car collision.

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,640
Moreover, the word "Die" was written with red spray paint

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,240
on the inside of the windshield of the car that was hit.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Don't tell me that this was also the work of the serial car thief.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,840
Three people were in the parking lot at the time the accident happened.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,340
The person who was driving the car that was hit,

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,040
Mr. Akitoshi Fukuchi, an office worker.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,440
Mrs. Noriko Shigei, a housewife who was driving the car that collided,

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,340
and free-lancer, Mr. Takero Nawa who was waiting for his friend to come.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,040
Is the car thief and person who caused the collision

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,640
among the three?

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,640
If all cases were men,

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,540
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,240
The culprit and your first lover.

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
You've got two things to figure out, Officer Chiba.

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,740
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:41,463
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 2)".

39
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:47,163
I'd like to make a declaration.

40
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:50,763
As a result of careful investigation...

41
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,763
There was no one other than you three, after all!

42
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:58,763
This means that the culprit is among you, right?

43
00:03:58,763 --> 00:03:59,963
No.

44
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:02,263
Why am I, who was hit from behind

45
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,263
also included as one of the suspects?

46
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,863
Why not?

47
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:08,163
There's a possibility that you deliberately hit the car,

48
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:12,163
and passed out, making it look as if you were the victim.

49
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,463
"Akitoshi Fukuchi (41), Office worker" -Give me a break!

50
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,463
My wife and daughter are waiting for me to come home.

51
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:18,563
"Noriko Shigei (36), Housewife" -Same here,

52
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:21,663
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

53
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:23,363
"Takero Nawa (22), Free-lancer" -I got to hurry home too,

54
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,063
or my parents will get on my back.

55
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,563
Don't tell me, you give a hoot about your parents?

56
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:31,263
Yeah. They happen to be school teachers, you know.

57
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:33,163
And, they didn't say anything

58
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:36,163
about that flashy wing on your car?

59
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:38,963
It doesn't look like your car passed the safety check, does it?

60
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:42,063
No, they haven't seen it.

61
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,663
Come to think of it,

62
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:47,663
there was a wing on the third car that was attacked, right?

63
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,063
Yes.

64
00:04:49,063 --> 00:04:52,463
But, your car wasn't attacked, was it?

65
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:53,963
I wonder why.

66
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:55,263
How should I know?

67
00:04:55,263 --> 00:05:01,063
The wing on your car is much flashier

68
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:04,563
and the position of the wing is higher too.

69
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:07,363
If you check the car that was attacked in more detail,

70
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,163
maybe you'll find something more.

71
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:10,263
If so,

72
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:13,063
would you like to look at the pictures taken from a different angle too?

73
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,763
I brought it along in my mini patrol car that's parked outside.

74
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,863
I'll go get it then!

75
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,263
Thank you!

76
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:23,063
Hey, Officer Chiba, don't you have to go with her?

77
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:24,063
Why?

78
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,663
If there are a lot of pictures,

79
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,463
it'll be tough bringing them all here, right?

80
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:30,863
It's the duty of men to help women!

81
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,563
-Come on. -Go on, hurry!

82
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,863
What's with you guys staring into each other's eyes

83
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:10,763
like in some romantic move?

84
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,163
Go on,

85
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,263
hurry and go take pictures.

86
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:15,563
Yes!

87
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:22,263
I wish you wouldn't go giving the eye to new-comers.

88
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,563
Giving the eye?

89
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:28,563
I think it's best that we explain things to her.

90
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:30,763
You can say that again.

91
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,063
Oh, boy.

92
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,763
What? You mean they're each other's first love

93
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,363
and are still in love with each other,

94
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,163
but Officer Chiba still isn't aware who she is?

95
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:42,063
Are you serious?

96
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:44,063
Yep!

97
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,663
Hold it.

98
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,963
Miwako and Officer Takagi...

99
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:52,263
Then, there are Officer Shiratori and Ms. Kobayashi, the teacher.

100
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:53,463
On top of that...

101
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:58,363
if those two get it on well...

102
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:02,263
Bye, Yumi.

103
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,663
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,263
See you.

105
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:10,363
I've got to stop them.

106
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,963
It's true that there are pictures taken from various angles.

107
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,063
But, including my car, I can't think of anything

108
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,663
that the cars that have been victimized have in common.

109
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:22,663
Don't tell me, she's asking about the mileage of my car?

110
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,263
I wonder what it was.

111
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:29,463
Don't you remember?

112
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:31,563
No, I don't remember.

113
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:34,763
I thought so.

114
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:39,363
Huh? I wonder if I voiced anything about the mileage?

115
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,763
Stupid.

116
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:45,263
So, let's hurry and go show the pictures to Conan!

117
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:48,663
He may come up with some interesting ideas again, you see!

118
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:51,963
She's obviously deliberately getting in the way.

119
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,863
It seems everything worked out the opposite of what was planned.

120
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,463
True.

121
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:03,263
Although the position of the wing is lower than that of Mr. Nawa's car...

122
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,163
I wonder why the car was attacked.

123
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:11,163
This is the second car that was vandalized, wasn't it?

124
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,163
Yes. It's the car of an officer worker

125
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:14,763
who was on his way home from golf.

126
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:18,463
There seems to be a lot of golf bags in the car.

127
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,863
It seems he had the golf bags of his friends inside too.

128
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:22,863
Wait a sec.

129
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,563
Could this be...

130
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,163
Hey, wasn't there any accidents near here

131
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,863
where a child was involved recently?

132
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:41,563
Yes, there was, last month.

133
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,663
The car that caused the accident

134
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:45,163
belonged to a high school teacher.

135
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,363
I heard that the driver completely admitted it to be his/her fault

136
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:49,763
and the case was settled out of court.

137
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,963
What kind of car was it?

138
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,963
An ordinary station wagon.

139
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:57,263
It seems that the family was on their way to the beach.

140
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,263
They seem to have had

141
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:03,263
a lot of floats, beach balls, rubber boats and etc. loaded in their car.

142
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:05,363
There's no mistake about it.

143
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:07,863
The culprit is the person trying to force open

144
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:12,963
the eyes of the person whose eyes are closed.

145
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:19,063
And, so, Conan?

146
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:22,963
Have you figured something out from looking at that picture?

147
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,163
Huh? About what?

148
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:28,063
So!

149
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,563
Anything about serial car thief that sprayed the word "Die"

150
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:32,163
on the windshield with red spray paint,

151
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:34,663
who tried to make it off on that car,

152
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:40,663
but couldn't because she crashed into the car in front!

153
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,663
Moreover, since we closed off this parking lot after that accident,

154
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:47,263
the people who were here back then was

155
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,663
Mr. Fukuchi who was in his car that is said to have been hit from behind,

156
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:52,863
Mrs. Shigei, the owner of the car that was vandalized,

157
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:56,863
as well as the very car that hit Mr. Fukuchi's car

158
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:01,263
and Mr. Nawa who claims that he was waiting for his friend to show up.

159
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:05,663
So, Conan? Who of the three is the car thief?

160
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:08,563
Beats me.

161
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:10,063
I'm just a child, you know.

162
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:13,563
Don't tell me that you're not telling me despite knowing who it is.

163
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:15,563
Hey, Yumi...

164
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:18,263
The department store is asking

165
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:22,063
if they can start letting the customers into the parking lot already.

166
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:25,263
We've got no choice, let them in.

167
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:27,263
Okay, I guess we get to go too, don't we?

168
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:31,363
No! Because the culprit is among one of you three!

169
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,963
Then, why don't we do this?

170
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:36,963
Let's have the three come to the police station for now

171
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:38,563
and have them give their names, address,

172
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:42,563
as well as the reason why they're here and all the details to you, Yumi.

173
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:44,863
As for Officer Chiba's car

174
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,263
that was vandalized before the other cars were,

175
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:51,063
how about having the other policewoman take charge?

176
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,463
I guess so.

177
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:54,763
The young should work together.

178
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,163
Great idea, I guess.

179
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,563
I agree!

180
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,463
Yep, yep!

181
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:01,563
Well...

182
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:04,463
since I'm off duty, it doesn't bother me.

183
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,763
It... it really doesn't bother me either.

184
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,563
No way!

185
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,363
You belong to the second department

186
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:11,963
of violent crime investigations third division, don't you?

187
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,963
So you should be going after murderers!

188
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,063
But, you told me to cooperate with you just a while ago.

189
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:18,263
A while ago is a while ago, and now is now!

190
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,063
What?

191
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,063
She's getting in the way again.

192
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,163
Yep.

193
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:26,663
You go tell the department store to open up the parking lot.

194
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:27,763
Yes!

195
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:30,463
You go on home, Officer Chiba because you're just getting in the way!

196
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:32,163
Getting in the way?

197
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:34,963
Hey, do you have any acquaintances

198
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,963
that would print Ita cars, Officer Chiba?

199
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,463
I do.

200
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,963
How soon can it be printed?

201
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:44,963
Well, it's like a seal, so...

202
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,163
If it's just an ordinary character in stock

203
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,363
and only to be printed on one side,

204
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,463
I think it can be completed in two or three hours.

205
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,763
If so...

206
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:54,263
-What's this about? -Tell me about it too.

207
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,363
-Me too. -Tell me too!

208
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,163
Yes. It's okay to let the customers in,

209
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:01,963
but please inform them that they must avoid and go around

210
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,363
the scene of the accident.

211
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:07,663
I informed the department store.

212
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:11,163
Then, have the three come to the police station

213
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,063
and let's start interrogating them separately.

214
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:17,963
I think two or three hours...

215
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,463
That will do.

216
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:37,014
Hey, Takagi.

217
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:39,414
Have you seen my car key?

218
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,514
Oh, that...

219
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:44,114
Yumi took it with her a while ago.

220
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,714
Yumi did?

221
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,714
She said, "We'll do a little decorating, give me a sec".

222
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,314
Decorating?

223
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:51,614
Don't tell me, not again...

224
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:54,814
She's planning to stick on those weird stickers!

225
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:57,014
Stickers?

226
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:59,114
The ones that look like the green beginner driver stickers.

227
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:02,414
The ones that say, "Beginner lover's driving"!

228
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,914
I didn't realize that the sticker was on my car last time

229
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,714
and went to a murder site with it on

230
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:10,514
and was embarrassed to no end, you see!

231
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:14,914
Well, if they're magnet type or suction type stickers,

232
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:16,814
like the beginner driver stickers,

233
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,814
they can be removed easily.

234
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:17,214
Yes. That's it!

235
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:18,714
No more, because if you continue,

236
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:21,014
Miwako will get angry.

237
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:23,014
We've finally figured out

238
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:27,014
what the cars that were attacked had in common.

239
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,814
The first car was an Ita car.

240
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:33,614
The second car was loaded with golf bags.

241
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,814
The third car had wings.

242
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:39,414
The fourth one had toy boxes lined out.

243
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:43,314
And the Ita character that was decorated on the FD car.

244
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:47,614
The cars that were attacked

245
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:51,314
all had their rear windows blocked with something!

246
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:55,314
That's why you didn't attack Mr. Nawa's hot rod, right?

247
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:57,814
A flashy wing was attached,

248
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,714
but the position of the wing was low

249
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:02,714
and the rear window wasn't blocked off.

250
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,514
So on the other hand, stuffed dolls were lined out

251
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:08,214
blocking the entire rear window of Mr. Fukuchi's car.

252
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:11,414
Just when the car was about to start off,

253
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:14,314
you saw this from the driver's seat of your car

254
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,514
and inadvertently crashed your car into someone else's car.

255
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:23,414
That's right, isn't it?

256
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:24,814
Mrs. Noriko Shigiei!

257
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:28,514
After the collision,

258
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:30,314
you snapped back to yourself

259
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,614
and in order to make it through back then...

260
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,214
you used the spray that you had in your car

261
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:35,614
to write the word "Die"

262
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,914
to make it look as if the car thief had done it!

263
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,314
You figured that nobody would mentally suspect

264
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,314
that a car thief would vandalize his own car,

265
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:44,714
and you took advantage of this.

266
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,914
Is there something wrong in what I'm saying?

267
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:02,214
No use trying to flee!

268
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:06,814
This entire area has been completely surrounded by the police

269
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,714
while you were going through interrogation.

270
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,214
Yes.

271
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,014
This place is near your house

272
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,014
and on the way to the station.

273
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,014
In other words,

274
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,914
we were staking you out thinking that you, after seeing this Ita car

275
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:21,814
would return home to get the spray and tools necessary

276
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,714
to force open the key and return to the site.

277
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:28,314
Well, since tonight's strategy of using the FD was a trap set by us,

278
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:30,914
we'll overlook this, but...

279
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,114
as for the other things, spit it out, will you?

280
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:34,514
You did all this

281
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:38,514
for your son who died of a traffic accident last month, right?

282
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:44,214
The cause of the accident was careless safety confirmation.

283
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,514
Because the car was full of floats and rubber boats,

284
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:51,014
the view from the rearview mirror was blocked.

285
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:52,214
And, since you,

286
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:55,314
who unfortunately was behind that car pushing a stroller along,

287
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,514
wasn't in view of the driver,

288
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:02,714
you decided to attack all the impudent cars

289
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:05,514
with blocked rear view vision

290
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:08,714
to give them a taste of their own medicine.

291
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:22,614
But what a sad case

292
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:24,214
that the victim of an unfair accidental crime,

293
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:28,914
commits a crime in turn and becomes the criminal.

294
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,614
Yes.

295
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:33,314
The regulation concerning rear windows is ambiguous

296
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:36,814
and there are no laws to really enforce them yet.

297
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:38,214
But, Conan,

298
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,614
it's amazing

299
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:42,514
how you figured out that Mrs. Shigei lost her child.

300
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:46,514
It's the discolored part in the backseat of Mrs. Shigei's car.

301
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:50,514
I realized it when I saw the car in the parking lot.

302
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:54,014
It's discolored because a child seat was there, right?

303
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:55,814
If the car was newly bought only last year

304
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,714
and that seat is already discolored,

305
00:17:57,714 --> 00:18:00,414
it means that she had a child till last year, right?

306
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:04,614
But, it may have been removed because the child already grew up.

307
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:07,014
If the child needs a child seat,

308
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:09,514
he has to be younger than us.

309
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:12,914
So, if she were held back for interrogation as long as she was,

310
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:16,814
she would've naturally gotten worried about her child, right?

311
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:18,814
Come to think of it, that person...

312
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:23,514
I need to start getting dinner ready for my husband too.

313
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:27,214
She was only worried about her husband's dinner.

314
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:31,414
Right, right! The man said that his daughter was waiting, though.

315
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:36,214
I see! That's why she got a little angry when I asked

316
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:37,714
if there were any toys or things in the car.

317
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:41,414
Yep, because she had no need for things like that.

318
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:43,814
But, how'd you know

319
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:47,714
that the man had many dolls lined out in the back of his car?

320
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:49,014
Right,

321
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:53,114
although we could see that a lot was on the backseat of the car...

322
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:55,414
That man was saying, right?

323
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:59,214
That his daughter usually lines them out nicely so the view is not blocked.

324
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:00,214
In order to do so,

325
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:02,514
she has no choice but to line them out

326
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:05,314
on the rear window of the backseat, which is behind her head.

327
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:06,914
I see,

328
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:11,114
that's why she impulsively hit her own car.

329
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:12,114
She couldn't have possibly

330
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:14,514
gone into someone else's car while someone was inside it

331
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,614
and write the word "Die".

332
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,314
Right.

333
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,314
She may have wanted to expand the driver's view,

334
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:24,314
if she couldn't warn him by words.

335
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:28,414
The stuffed dolls would fall with the impact of the collision too.

336
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:30,314
But, unlike the other cars,

337
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:32,314
why was only the windshield of that car sprayed with red paint?

338
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:37,614
All the other cars had the word written on the ceiling inside, right?

339
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:39,214
Lipstick!

340
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,214
Her face was buried in the airbag that was ejected by the impact

341
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,514
and her lipstick got on it,

342
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:48,114
so she probably hid it with the same color red spray.

343
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:50,614
I think she tried to make it look as if

344
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:53,214
the red spray paint word on the windshield got onto the airbag.

345
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,314
Well, if lipstick is on it,

346
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:57,614
then saliva should also be there,

347
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,114
so we could've come up with the culprit by a DNA test.

348
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:03,714
Then, it wouldn't have been necessary to set a trap.

349
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:07,014
No, we did the right thing.

350
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:09,014
We couldn't let her go any further.

351
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:13,014
We don't want her to commit anymore sad crimes like this.

352
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:18,714
Then, Yumi!

353
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:21,214
I'll be leaving.

354
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:22,814
I may do some interrogation later,

355
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:25,214
so see you then!

356
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:29,214
I guess I'll inform Miwako who I borrowed the car from then.

357
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,114
See you, Officer Chiba!

358
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:36,114
Yeah!

359
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:48,214
That's right, I...

360
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,914
I've got to go back to the station on Miwako's FD,

361
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,514
so will you take care of our mini police car for me?

362
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,914
Yes!

363
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,814
Well, since you're at it,

364
00:20:57,814 --> 00:21:00,514
why not give Officer Chiba a ride home?

365
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:01,714
Yes!

366
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,314
I feel like I'm being escorted off or something.

367
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:08,814
I feel nervous.

368
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:12,214
This is the first time I ever rode a mini police car, you see.

369
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:13,814
Is that right?

370
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,114
But...

371
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:20,914
I can't help feeling that this isn't the first time.

372
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,514
That I'm seeing you.

373
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:28,814
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...

374
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:32,014
could you by chance be...

375
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,914
Yes?

376
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:59,314
Could you by chance be...

377
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:03,114
Yes.

378
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:07,314
The officer that gave me a parking ticket at Haido-cho the other day?

379
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:09,214
Yes.

380
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:12,314
I was transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department last month.

381
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:13,814
Just as I thought!

382
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:16,214
I was sure that I met you somewhere!

383
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:17,514
I see!

384
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:23,014
It seems as if Officer Chiba is not aware of anything.

385
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:24,314
-What? -What?

386
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:26,114
No kidding?

387
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,314
After Yumi tried to give them a chance...

388
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:30,414
Really.

389
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:32,914
It was like throwing pearls before swine after all.

390
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:34,514
Hey, hey.

391
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,814
Maybe it's better to say it's like preaching to deaf ears.

392
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:55,514
It can't be.

393
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,814
Hey!

394
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:04,414
What is this?

395
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:06,614
Please don't get mad at me.

396
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,514
"Next Episode" -Mr. Kogoro Mouri is a very very good person!

397
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:13,314
Yes...

398
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,214
Who are you?

399
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:22,214
Don't worry!

400
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,614
The case will be solved immediately!

401
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:28,914
We've got the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri on our side!

402
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:32,514
Hey, hey.

403
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,914
Next Conan,

404
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:37,714
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 1)".

405
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,314
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,614
"Key".

407
00:24:58,614 --> 00:25:00,314
In the next episode, Pops will play the good man.

408
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:01,814
-No darn way. -True.

409
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:03,210
I guess so.
