1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.640
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.540
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.440
What became of the two officers?

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.940
As the evening grows, will their love fade?

5
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.953
We found out from Officer Yumi

9
00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:06.653
that Officer Sato is going to be meeting a marriage candidate

10
00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:08.453
who she has never met before.

11
00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:11.853
No problem! Because it's all worked out

12
00:02:11.853 --> 00:02:15.353
that she'll get out of there when the time is right.

13
00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:18.353
But who's going to do that?

14
00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:21.353
You silly thing. Who else but Officer Takagi?

15
00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:22.953
I'm going to mail him on his phone with the message,

16
00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:24.753
"Miwako is in trouble!"

17
00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:27.753
And say that a criminal case has come up

18
00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:30.453
and take her away from where she is.

19
00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:32.653
I'm sure that he'll going bursting in with a face

20
00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:34.453
that you've never seen before.

21
00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:35.653
You witch.

22
00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:39.653
We arrived at Mizutozakura with feeling curious feelings.

23
00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:43.053
What?

24
00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:46.653
Shiratori? Don't tell me that he's the one from the police department?

25
00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:49.853
Yes, he's in the Tsuru Room together with Ms. Sato.

26
00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:53.553
Which means that the man Officer Sato is meeting is...

27
00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.253
Inspector Shiratori?

28
00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:56.353
Robber!

29
00:02:56.353 --> 00:02:58.653
Someone, please catch him!

30
00:02:58.653 --> 00:03:03.353
At that time, Officer Takagi met a robber at a convenience store.

31
00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:06.953
He ran after a criminal and hunted him down at a restroom in the park.

32
00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.153
However, there were three suspects.

33
00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:12.953
Besides, he hasn't been able to clear which one is the criminal,

34
00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:15.353
because everyone testified differently.

35
00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:19.153
Just a little while longer.

36
00:03:20.653 --> 00:03:24.053
Hello, Officer Yumi? My hands are tied just yet and...

37
00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:27.153
Hi, this is Shinichi Kudo.

38
00:03:27.153 --> 00:03:28.453
What?

39
00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:31.253
Conan asked me to give you a call.

40
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.753
What did Conan ask you to do?

41
00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:37.453
Please check your cell phone mail

42
00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:40.053
and take note of the situation that you're in now.

43
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:44.553
But the only mail I got today was from Officer Yumi.

44
00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:47.453
"Miwako is in trouble!

45
00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:49.853
Resue her from Minatoro where she is holding a marrige meeting."

46
00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:54.553
Officer Sato is meeting her husband to be?

47
00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:59.253
So, you haven't read the mail, have you?

48
00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:01.753
But don't worry, and please calm down.

49
00:04:01.753 --> 00:04:04.753
There's still a lot of time to go until sundown,

50
00:04:04.753 --> 00:04:07.853
and the place she's meeting him is in the neighboring town, Haido-cho.

51
00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.253
Sundown?

52
00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:15.153
Officer Sato agreed to the terms that her proposed husband suggested.

53
00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:20.653
If you don't solve the case by sundown and go to get her,

54
00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:24.153
she's going to have to accept her partner's marriage proposal.

55
00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:28.153
Please give me the details of the case.

56
00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:30.653
Officer Takagi?

57
00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:33.653
Officer Takagi, can you hear me?

58
00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:34.853
Hey...

59
00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:43.753
"Love Story At Police Headquarters 4 (Part 2)"

60
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:48.553
I have the three suspects that were in the restroom in the park

61
00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:52.253
where the robber fled into with me.

62
00:04:52.253 --> 00:04:54.853
Of the three, two are men.

63
00:04:54.853 --> 00:04:58.653
One of them is Mr. Hiroshi Zama, 21 years old, a part-time worker.

64
00:04:58.653 --> 00:05:00.753
He is about 180 centimeters tall,

65
00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:04.353
and is wearing a blue sweater and pierced earrings.

66
00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:08.153
The other man is Yasuo Kameida, 32 years old.

67
00:05:08.153 --> 00:05:11.553
He is a prep school teacher and about 170 centimeters tall.

68
00:05:11.553 --> 00:05:14.753
He is wearing a green sweater and glasses.

69
00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:18.153
The last one is a woman called Ms. Eiko Koshimizu.

70
00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:20.053
She is 28 years old and works in an office.

71
00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.153
She is about 160 centimeters tall,

72
00:05:22.153 --> 00:05:26.053
and is wearing black clothes and wears two wristwatches.

73
00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:29.153
When the robber broke into the convenience store,

74
00:05:29.153 --> 00:05:32.653
the outfit the robber had on were a helmet, a coat, and gloves.

75
00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:34.153
The robber stuck out a knife

76
00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:36.753
and showed the employee a paper with the words, "Give me money."

77
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.753
The robber is still unidentified.

78
00:05:38.753 --> 00:05:40.053
There is no doubt

79
00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:41.553
that the robber disposed of the coat

80
00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:44.253
and ran into the restroom in the park.

81
00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:50.553
But the problem is that the testimony of the witnesses all differ.

82
00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:53.453
The old man who bumped into the robber in front of the park says

83
00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:57.153
the robber is a woman wearing blue clothes.

84
00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:59.753
The girl who was watching through the window of a shop says

85
00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:03.153
that the robber's head stuck out from among the throng of people,

86
00:06:03.153 --> 00:06:04.953
so the robber who is about 180 centimeters tall

87
00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.153
and is most likely a man.

88
00:06:06.153 --> 00:06:10.053
And from under the coat, she saw a color green shirt.

89
00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:12.353
As for the owner of the coffee shop,

90
00:06:12.353 --> 00:06:16.153
he said when he was outside the shop, he saw the robber running away.

91
00:06:17.153 --> 00:06:19.353
He says that the robber was about 170 centimeters

92
00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:22.653
and wearing black clothes under the coat.

93
00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:23.753
I see.

94
00:06:23.753 --> 00:06:25.053
All three suspects that was testified

95
00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:28.453
has totally different characteristics of the robber.

96
00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:30.253
How interesting!

97
00:06:30.253 --> 00:06:32.753
What do you mean by interesting, Kudo?

98
00:06:32.753 --> 00:06:33.853
First of all,

99
00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:38.553
go to that coffee shop and talk to Mr. Mamehara, the owner.

100
00:06:39.453 --> 00:06:41.753
How did you know the owner's name?

101
00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:43.953
I've known him from before.

102
00:06:47.753 --> 00:06:49.853
Officer, what's up?

103
00:06:49.853 --> 00:06:51.853
Did you arrest the robber?

104
00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:53.253
Not yet.

105
00:06:53.253 --> 00:06:55.353
Take the owner outside.

106
00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:57.153
Hurry!

107
00:06:57.153 --> 00:06:58.753
Hey!

108
00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:00.653
Where are you taking me?

109
00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.653
Let's talk inside the shop.

110
00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:04.853
I'm sorry, but please come with me.

111
00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:07.553
What's with you?

112
00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:10.453
Your glasses are sunglasses?

113
00:07:11.453 --> 00:07:13.253
I'm pretty sure that the sunglasses

114
00:07:13.253 --> 00:07:14.553
that the owner's wearing have photochromic lens

115
00:07:14.553 --> 00:07:17.253
that change color for about 15 seconds

116
00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:20.753
when he goes outside and is exposed to ultraviolet rays.

117
00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:23.453
From what I know, the owner doesn't wear glasses,

118
00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:25.953
so I thought that it may be possible.

119
00:07:25.953 --> 00:07:29.053
Well, I'm wearing these glasses just for show.

120
00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:31.353
I decided to wear them just for fun only recently.

121
00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:32.953
I completely forgot about them.

122
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:36.453
Which means that the robber's clothes that you saw

123
00:07:36.453 --> 00:07:37.853
may have looked darker than the actual color

124
00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:40.653
because of the change in the color of the lens of your glasses?

125
00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:45.353
But about the robber being about 170 centimeters is a fact.

126
00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:46.653
But...

127
00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:51.353
another witness says that the robber was about 180 centimeters.

128
00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:54.153
The shop that the girl said she saw the robber through the window,

129
00:07:54.153 --> 00:07:56.053
where is it?

130
00:07:56.053 --> 00:07:59.653
About 100 meters from this coffee shop.

131
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:01.353
In the direction of the convenience store.

132
00:08:01.353 --> 00:08:03.453
Oh, it's over there.

133
00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:06.653
Then, please go to where the shop is.

134
00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.453
If I remember correctly,

135
00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:11.553
she said she saw the head of the robber above the throng of people?

136
00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:13.053
Yes.

137
00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:14.253
That street

138
00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:16.153
leads from the entrance of the subway to the bus stop,

139
00:08:16.153 --> 00:08:17.253
so depending on the time,

140
00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:21.153
it becomes congested with people.

141
00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:23.853
If a throng of people come heading in your direction,

142
00:08:23.853 --> 00:08:26.653
how would you try to make it through, Officer Takagi?

143
00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:28.153
How?

144
00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:30.753
I would try to avoid them as much as possible.

145
00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:31.853
If you feel that doing so

146
00:08:31.853 --> 00:08:33.953
will not get you through the crowd, then what will you do?

147
00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:41.853
Well, I would have no choice

148
00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:43.953
but to give up running along the sidewalk part way

149
00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:46.053
and run along the curbstone...

150
00:08:46.053 --> 00:08:48.053
I get it!

151
00:08:48.053 --> 00:08:51.353
The girl witnessed the robber running along the curb stone,

152
00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:54.153
and mistook the robber's height as being over 180 centimeters!

153
00:08:54.153 --> 00:08:55.353
A puzzle.

154
00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:58.453
It's a jigsaw puzzle, Officer Takagi.

155
00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:01.153
Although the pieces may look scattered and mismatching,

156
00:09:01.153 --> 00:09:03.653
if you rotate them and look at them from a different angle,

157
00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:05.653
they will surely fit in perfectly.

158
00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:08.353
The mismatching pieces of testimony that the witnesses

159
00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:11.053
give us are indispensable pieces

160
00:09:11.053 --> 00:09:14.253
that we need to complete the puzzle.

161
00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:20.153
Conan's sure taking his time, isn't he?

162
00:09:20.153 --> 00:09:22.753
Oh, I guess I'll go check on him.

163
00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:31.553
I wonder if Conan ate something bad.

164
00:09:31.553 --> 00:09:34.153
I made toast and sunny side ups for breakfast today.

165
00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:38.553
And for lunch...

166
00:09:44.253 --> 00:09:46.753
I'm pretty sure I've seen

167
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.453
that person once before...

168
00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:51.353
Oh, my. So it wasn't the right person after all?

169
00:09:52.453 --> 00:09:54.553
I've seen that person somewhere before.

170
00:09:57.053 --> 00:10:01.453
The only person left is the old man who says he ran into the robber.

171
00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:03.653
According to my deduction,

172
00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:06.353
the testimony of that old man is the most decisive.

173
00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:07.753
Hey, Kudo.

174
00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:08.953
Yes?

175
00:10:08.953 --> 00:10:10.153
Why?

176
00:10:10.153 --> 00:10:11.953
How did you know so much?

177
00:10:13.853 --> 00:10:16.353
-Well, that's... -Conan?

178
00:10:16.353 --> 00:10:18.253
Oh, no! It's Ran!

179
00:10:18.253 --> 00:10:20.553
Conan, are you all right?

180
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:25.353
Oh, so will you please talk to that old man once more?

181
00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:28.253
Then, you'll be able to narrow the robber down to just one person!

182
00:10:30.453 --> 00:10:32.253
Hold on.

183
00:10:36.653 --> 00:10:39.953
If I remember correctly the old man testified

184
00:10:39.953 --> 00:10:44.953
that the robber was a woman wearing blue clothes under her coat.

185
00:10:44.953 --> 00:10:48.253
But Mr. Zama is the one who is the one wearing blue clothes.

186
00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:50.553
Oh, yes. It's his pierced earrings!

187
00:10:50.553 --> 00:10:53.553
The old man saw the earrings and thought it was a woman...

188
00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:55.553
Oh, wait. When they bumped into each other the robber

189
00:10:55.553 --> 00:10:57.253
should still have been wearing the helmet.

190
00:10:57.253 --> 00:10:59.953
He couldn't have seen the robber's face.

191
00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:02.553
Then, why did he think the robber was a woman?

192
00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:04.853
Darn it.

193
00:11:04.853 --> 00:11:07.253
40 minutes left to sundown.

194
00:11:07.253 --> 00:11:09.553
I've got to hurry or else Officer Sato will have to...

195
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.453
Watch...

196
00:11:13.453 --> 00:11:16.553
Come to think of it, that person...

197
00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:19.853
I see! That's what it was!

198
00:11:19.853 --> 00:11:21.553
I've got it!

199
00:11:21.553 --> 00:11:23.253
I've figured out who the robber is!

200
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.861
The sun has set quite a bit.

201
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:40.961
Oh, I guess so.

202
00:11:40.961 --> 00:11:42.761
Officer Sato.

203
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:45.661
It's not that I don't trust you,

204
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:49.361
but if Officer Takagi fails to make it here in time,

205
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:51.961
I'd like some proof of it.

206
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.361
Proof?

207
00:11:55.561 --> 00:11:56.661
As proof of it,

208
00:11:56.661 --> 00:11:58.661
I'd like you to give me a kiss as a pledge of your promise.

209
00:12:01.461 --> 00:12:02.661
He said a kiss.

210
00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:05.461
A kiss of pledge?

211
00:12:05.461 --> 00:12:07.761
Me and you?

212
00:12:09.661 --> 00:12:10.661
Yes.

213
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.461
You don't mind, do you?

214
00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:15.261
Because if Officer Takagi doesn't come here by sundown,

215
00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:17.761
we're going to get married anyway.

216
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:21.061
You promised not to go back on your word, didn't you?

217
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:24.961
Yes, of course.

218
00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:27.261
Come on. What's keeping you, Officer Takagi?

219
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:29.661
Hurry up and arrest the robber, will you?

220
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:35.961
Oh, Officer Takagi.

221
00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:37.961
Did you find out anything new?

222
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:39.761
No, not at all.

223
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.161
The testimonies of the witnesses

224
00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:44.861
are still all different as far as the robber is concerned.

225
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:47.461
A woman wearing a blue dress,

226
00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:51.061
a man wearing green clothes that is more than 180 centimeters tall

227
00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:53.761
or a person wearing black clothes that is about 170 centimeters.

228
00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:56.161
That's no help...

229
00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:57.861
We can't possibly narrow down the suspect to one person

230
00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:00.161
with what we've got now.

231
00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:03.561
I guess I'll take my time.

232
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:04.861
Because after all, it's still before 3 pm.

233
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:07.261
So, I've still got lots of time.

234
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:08.961
Hey, just what are you talking about?

235
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:11.561
Your watch must be broken.

236
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:14.061
It's already 4:30 pm.

237
00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.361
Huh?

238
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.261
So, it was you after all, wasn't it?

239
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:18.261
Huh?

240
00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:19.561
Officer Takagi.

241
00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:22.361
The owner shop said that the robber was wearing black clothes

242
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:26.961
because he had glasses with photochromic lens on.

243
00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:30.361
And the girl said the robber was more than 180 meters tall

244
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:32.061
because the robber in order to avoid the crowd,

245
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.561
he ran along the curbstone.

246
00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:35.761
Aside from the testimonies black clothes

247
00:13:35.761 --> 00:13:37.761
and more than 180 centimeters,

248
00:13:37.761 --> 00:13:41.761
when matching the testimonies of the two,

249
00:13:41.761 --> 00:13:43.161
the robber is said to have been about 170 centimeters

250
00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:45.961
and wearing green clothes.

251
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:47.661
In other words, Mr. Kamieda...

252
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.161
you're the one who did it.

253
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:52.961
But the old man who bumped into the robber said that

254
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:55.061
the robber was a woman wearing blue clothes.

255
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:56.161
Yes.

256
00:13:56.161 --> 00:13:57.361
But at that time,

257
00:13:57.361 --> 00:14:00.161
it had completely slipped my mind that the witness

258
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:02.961
was an elderly man.

259
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:08.161
Take a look.

260
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:10.261
What a beautiful sunset.

261
00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:17.961
20 more minutes to go untill the sun completely sets.

262
00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:20.361
Officer Takagi.

263
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:25.361
Officer Takagi.

264
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.561
Officer Takagi!

265
00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:35.161
I get it, the old man!

266
00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:36.861
Elderly men in Japan sometimes say blue

267
00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:38.961
when they actually mean the color green!

268
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:40.061
Yes.

269
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:41.061
Elderly people in Japan

270
00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:43.361
used to say blue regardless of

271
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:45.961
whether they meant indigo, light blue or green.

272
00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:50.261
After recalling that Mr. Kamieda was a prep school teacher,

273
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:51.861
an idea raced through my mind.

274
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:52.861
He mentioned that

275
00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:54.861
he tried to devise ways of not making the students worry

276
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.561
about the passage of time during his classes.

277
00:14:56.561 --> 00:14:58.361
So, I figured that it could be that he had the face

278
00:14:58.361 --> 00:15:00.261
of his wristwatch turned towards the inner part of his wrist

279
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:04.261
where only he himself could see what time it was.

280
00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:09.061
I see.

281
00:15:09.061 --> 00:15:10.261
So the old man

282
00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:11.261
mistook the robber as being a woman

283
00:15:11.261 --> 00:15:13.261
because the face of the robber's wristwatch was on the inner side

284
00:15:13.261 --> 00:15:15.461
of the wrist than the outer.

285
00:15:15.461 --> 00:15:16.661
Yes.

286
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:18.761
He probably always used to wear his wristwatch in this fashion

287
00:15:18.761 --> 00:15:20.261
because it was too much trouble

288
00:15:20.261 --> 00:15:22.661
to keep changing the position of his wristwatch for every class.

289
00:15:22.661 --> 00:15:23.661
In other words,

290
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.461
the testimony of the witnesses all point to the fact

291
00:15:26.461 --> 00:15:29.961
that you are the one who robbed the convenience store,

292
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:31.961
Mr. Kamieda!

293
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:37.361
A little less than 10 minutes to go.

294
00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:40.661
I guess I've won the bet.

295
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:47.661
Please don't wear such a dreadful look.

296
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:49.861
I'm not going to force you to marry me right away,

297
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:51.961
at least not until you're perfectly ready to accept me.

298
00:15:51.961 --> 00:15:54.161
I'm willing to wait as long as you want me to.

299
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.561
Huh?

300
00:15:55.561 --> 00:15:56.761
I don't want to make an enemy out of you.

301
00:15:56.761 --> 00:15:59.461
I'm always on your side.

302
00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:01.161
Inspector Shiratori...

303
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:05.461
The phone...

304
00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:06.961
Oh, Officer Sato?

305
00:16:06.961 --> 00:16:08.261
Takagi here!

306
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:11.961
I just arrested the convenience store robber.

307
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:14.461
The place you're at is pretty near from here,

308
00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:16.361
so I'll be over in about five minutes.

309
00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:19.061
Just hurry up and come get me then, will you?

310
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.761
Good grief.

311
00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:24.061
May I ask you a question before I head on there?

312
00:16:24.061 --> 00:16:25.661
What?

313
00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:27.561
Why me?

314
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:30.261
-Huh? -Why did you believe in a person like me...

315
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:31.361
and agree to bet on something so important

316
00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:33.061
that would affect your whole life?

317
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:36.461
Because I was positive that you would come get me!

318
00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:37.761
Does it bug you?

319
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.661
Oh, well...

320
00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:41.761
You see, that's...

321
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:44.061
Maybe...

322
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:46.661
You...

323
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:51.261
Well, you...

324
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.161
I thought that you like...

325
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:55.261
The robber got away!

326
00:16:55.261 --> 00:16:56.461
Hey, freeze!

327
00:16:57.461 --> 00:16:59.061
Come on, Officer Takagi!

328
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:01.261
Oh, but...

329
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:03.761
I don't have time left!

330
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:05.161
Officer Takagi.

331
00:17:05.161 --> 00:17:10.361
Which means more to you, the convenience store robber or me?

332
00:17:10.361 --> 00:17:11.561
Huh?

333
00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:14.261
Go after him, Officer Takagi!

334
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:15.561
Yes!

335
00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:26.161
Are you sure it's okay?

336
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:29.361
If he goes after the robber now, there's no way he'll make it in time.

337
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:30.361
Well, if so,

338
00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:31.361
I guess I'll have to resign to the fact that

339
00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:33.061
it was destined to turn out this way.

340
00:17:33.061 --> 00:17:35.361
It could be that the heavens punished me

341
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:37.661
for getting Officer Takagi involved in this bet without his permission.

342
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:40.361
But a bet's a bet!

343
00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:42.861
Shall we get started...

344
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:45.361
with that pledge or whatever it is?

345
00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:07.961
4:56 pm, suspect arrested.

346
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:12.661
I wanted money.

347
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:14.661
I needed severance money

348
00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:17.461
to give to a woman who persistently hung around me.

349
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:20.561
Goodness.

350
00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:28.161
I've come quite a distance

351
00:18:28.161 --> 00:18:30.361
from Minatorou.

352
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:33.361
I would never be able to make it there now.

353
00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:38.661
Officer Takagi!

354
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:45.061
You did it, Officer Takagi.

355
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.061
No, I goofed and let go of

356
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:51.761
who I really wanted to catch the most.

357
00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:01.461
Hey, so what's the matter?

358
00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:03.561
Hurry up and get on with it.

359
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:05.561
I'm all ready and set!

360
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.661
Ready and set?

361
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:11.461
But your face says you don't want to.

362
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:13.961
Don't worry, Miwako.

363
00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:17.661
Let's just stay this way for a while and calm down a bit.

364
00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:21.161
After all, there is nothing to keep us apart anymore anyway.

365
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:27.761
They're finally going to kiss.

366
00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:29.461
I'll go stop them!

367
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:32.061
What are you talking about?

368
00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:35.161
Dr. Araide, can you please come here?

369
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:43.061
I'll take him to the station,

370
00:19:43.061 --> 00:19:44.961
so you go on ahead, Officer Takagi.

371
00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:46.361
You're an officer, aren't you?

372
00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:47.561
If so, then do what an officer

373
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:50.161
is expected to do and pursue your target until the end!

374
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:51.161
Takagi!

375
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:53.661
Okay.

376
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:55.561
The sun will completely set soon.

377
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:56.861
Have you calmed down?

378
00:19:56.861 --> 00:19:58.961
Yes.

379
00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:01.261
What is it, Conan?

380
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:02.861
You know...

381
00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:07.761
I never realized

382
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:10.661
that he had...

383
00:20:10.661 --> 00:20:14.561
come to mean so much to me.

384
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:19.461
Hey...

385
00:20:19.461 --> 00:20:20.861
Hold it!

386
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:29.461
I'm really a crummy officer

387
00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:32.661
for realizing something like this only now.

388
00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:36.161
I guess this is just what I need to forget the whole deal.

389
00:20:36.161 --> 00:20:38.361
Goodbye, Officer Takagi.

390
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:41.361
Assistant Inspector Miwako Sato!

391
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:45.361
I'm sorry to bother you when you're off duty,

392
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:46.461
but we've got a case

393
00:20:46.461 --> 00:20:48.561
and I hope you'll come to back us up?

394
00:20:48.561 --> 00:20:50.461
Officer Takagi?

395
00:20:50.461 --> 00:20:53.461
He's come! Officer Takagi!

396
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.061
Bad timing!

397
00:20:56.061 --> 00:20:58.261
Officer Takagi!

398
00:20:58.261 --> 00:20:59.861
Officer Takagi?

399
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:06.161
Conan?

400
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:08.261
Officer Takagi...

401
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:13.761
Officer Takagi just went running down the corridor to the entrance.

402
00:21:13.761 --> 00:21:16.961
Good grief.

403
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.161
Oh, Miwako.

404
00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:21.861
Miss?

405
00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:08.261
No good.

406
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:10.661
The sun has completely set.

407
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:14.561
I couldn't make it in time.

408
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:19.661
Police Sergeant Takagi!

409
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:20.861
Huh?

410
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:21.861
What the hell are you doing?

411
00:23:21.861 --> 00:23:22.861
Hurry up, get in!

412
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:25.161
Officer Sato.

413
00:23:28.461 --> 00:23:30.061
You've got a case on your hands, haven't you?

414
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:32.461
Oh, yes.

415
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:43.861
I couldn't help but wanting to help out.

416
00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:49.461
I mean those two are so awkward at things like this

417
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:52.461
just like some other two whom I'm really familiar with.

418
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:57.661
Sire...

419
00:24:00.761 --> 00:24:03.461
I feel real bad for doing this to Inspector Shiratori, though.

420
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.361
"Next Episode" -Mr. Ushikubo passed away?

421
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:10.161
What?

422
00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:12.661
There's blood on his fingertip.

423
00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:15.661
Besides, it looks like he touched something.

424
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:27.761
Why on earth did that person?

425
00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:31.161
Next Conan,

426
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:35.182
"The Linked Poetry Incident At Tamatsukuri In Matsue (Part 1)"

427
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:38.779
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:40.079
"Autumn leaves"
