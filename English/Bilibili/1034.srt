1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.440
On the way home from school,

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.980
Miyamoto Yumi-san forced me to accompany
her as she tailed Haneda Shukichi Meijin,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.650
who she suspected of infidelity.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.620
However, Haneda Meijin was simply
meeting some young shogi players

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.280
at an apartment for a shogi study session.

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.700
When we went to the apartment where
the study sessions were held...

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.630
It's unlocked.

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.260
Come on, man. At least lock the door.

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.530
Genda-san?

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.300
G-Genda-san!

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.300
Hishinuma-san?

12
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.430
Genda-san, are you all right?! Genda-san!

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.900
What's wrong, Hishinuma-san? No way!

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.040
Genda-san?

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.900
You're kidding, right?

16
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.640
Something's really wrong with Genda-san.

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.450
He's not moving.

18
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.340
How is he, Hishinuma-san?

19
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.910
He's not breathing.

20
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.760
N-No...

21
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.660
He's not dead, is he?

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.070
Genda-san, wake up!

23
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.720
Open your eyes, Genda-san!

24
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.650
Hey, Genda-san!

25
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.920
It comes to visit after falling asleep!

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.810
Fall in love with logical deduction
and the pleasure of solving mysteries!

27
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.400
What is Taiko Meijin's next move?

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.070
Always determining the one truth

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.920
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

30
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.430
his name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.710
Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board
(Brilliant Move)

32
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.150
Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board
(Brilliant Move)
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Brilliant Move!"

33
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.970
Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board
(Brilliant Move)

34
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.100
Is it true that you all left Genda-san
in this room to go shopping

35
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.940
before Haneda Meijin, Yumi,
and Conan-kun arrived?

36
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.600
Y-Yes.

37
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.110
He said he'd put together some snacks.

38
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.870
It's what we always did.

39
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.290
What kind of snacks?

40
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.980
Like cheese and prosciutto on crackers.

41
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.040
You can eat them while playing
without getting your hands dirty.

42
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.450
Genda Yasukiyo
Shogi Player

43
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.170
Genda Yasukiyo
Shogi Player
This must've happened when someone came here
during the ten minutes we were out shopping.

44
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.470
This must've happened when someone came here
during the ten minutes we were out shopping.

45
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.170
The front door was unlocked.

46
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.230
He probably unlocked the door
because he thought we'd returned.

47
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.580
But isn't it possible that one of you

48
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.620
pretended to leave but actually
returned to the room to kill him?

49
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.860
Th-That's not what happened!

50
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.210
Hishinuma Kosuke (24)
Shogi Player

51
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.990
Hishinuma Kosuke (24)
Shogi Player
I bought enough hot coffee for all
of us at the nearby coffee shop.

52
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.380
I bought enough hot coffee for all
of us at the nearby coffee shop.

53
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.870
They were kind of lukewarm,
but I really did buy them, right?

54
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.520
Y-Yeah.

55
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.680
We heard the coffee's
flavor had gotten worse,

56
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.500
so we drank some at the entrance downstairs.

57
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.170
But couldn't you use instant coffee and water

58
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.470
from a hot water heater
to make lukewarm coffee?

59
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.830
Actually, the water
heater's broken right now.

60
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.640
It only dispenses cold water.

61
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.520
We'd been talking about how
we needed to call a repairman.

62
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.140
Then how about an electric kettle?

63
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.430
I broke that the other day, too.

64
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.280
What about that stove?

65
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.280
Couldn't you use that to boil water?

66
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.570
Well, yeah, but...

67
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.260
But when we found Genda-san,

68
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.290
Hishinuma-san and Mina put the bags
they were holding on top of the stove.

69
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.970
Why don't you check the bottoms of the bags?

70
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.310
There's nothing unusual about them.

71
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.300
Then nobody used that stove.

72
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.060
We were out shopping for about ten minutes.

73
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.900
If someone used the stove to boil water,
it would stay hot for about 15 minutes.

74
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.430
The bags should be burnt or melted.

75
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.870
I see.

76
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.400
Then who bought this bread?

77
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.950
I-I did.

78
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.230
Katsumata Mina (23)
Female Shogi Player

79
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.370
Katsumata Mina (23)
Female Shogi Player
I'm really into that bakery's bread.

80
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.080
Katsumata Mina (23)
Female Shogi Player
The store's nearby, and I always bought some.

81
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.450
The store's nearby, and I always bought some.

82
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.000
But you could buy bread
beforehand, couldn't you?

83
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.910
I bought hot freshly baked bread.

84
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.920
They really were warm and tasty looking.

85
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.670
It's too bad they didn't have any
freshly fried curry bread, though.

86
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.620
It's their most popular
item, so it was sold out.

87
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.310
Well, there doesn't seem
to be a microwave here.

88
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.880
It would be impossible to reheat bread.

89
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.920
Uryu-san, what did you buy?

90
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.190
Right.

91
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.500
Uryu Shoko (23)
Female Shogi Player

92
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.060
Uryu Shoko (23)
Female Shogi Player
I bought ice cream.

93
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.780
Uryu Shoko (23)
Female Shogi Player
They're from a shop that
opened around here recently.

94
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.700
They're from a shop that
opened around here recently.

95
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.110
Everyone said they loved them
after I bought some once.

96
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.450
That must be the melted
ice cream inside the box.

97
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.710
Yes. Putting them in the freezer
wasn't a priority at the time.

98
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.480
They were freezing cold
when I bought them, right?

99
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.740
Y-Yeah.

100
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.010
But if you hid the ice
cream in the freezer...

101
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.000
Before we went shopping, we all checked
to see if we were out of anything.

102
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.390
There wasn't any ice cream then.

103
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.460
And today we met at the shogi hall
before heading here together.

104
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.490
Nobody could've put something
in the room beforehand.

105
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.530
Hishinuma-san came empty-handed,

106
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.770
and Mina and I only brought small handbags.

107
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.320
Which means this murder might
be the work of an outsider.

108
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.170
Not only that, but it's likely
that these are serial murders.

109
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.470
S-Serial murders?!

110
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.760
It was publicly announced this afternoon that
when missing shogi player Nishikido Kimiharu,

111
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.600
It was publicly announced this afternoon that
when missing shogi player Nishikido Kimiharu,
Nishikido Kimiharu
Shogi Player

112
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.970
who was suspected of match fixing, was found,

113
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.350
one of the legs of the shogi board
next to the body had been cut off.

114
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.740
And two legs have been removed from
the shogi board next to Genda's body.

115
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.740
It's only been a couple hours
since the announcement,

116
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.500
so it's unlikely that this was a copycat.

117
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.750
Did any of you know Nishikido?

118
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.740
The three of us didn't,

119
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.920
but apparently the late Genda-san
and Nishikido-san were friends.

120
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.200
These study sessions were
originally run by Nishikido-san.

121
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.480
The four original members were
Nishikido-san, Genda-san,

122
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.180
Kishimoto Yuhei-san, who
recently became depressed,

123
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.100
Kishimoto Yuhei-san, who
recently became depressed,
Kishimoto Yuhei
Shogi Player

124
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.350
Kishimoto Yuhei-san, who
recently became depressed,

125
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.840
Uryu Kinji
Shogi Player

126
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.480
Uryu Kinji
Shogi Player
and Uryu Kinji, who went pro
around the same time I did.

127
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.360
and Uryu Kinji, who went pro
around the same time I did.

128
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.360
Uryu?

129
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.030
Uryu is Shoko-san's older brother.

130
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.760
I've heard rumors about those four, too.

131
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.460
They say there's a foursome that's been
rapidly improving their skills recently.

132
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.910
But why did Nishikido stop
attending the study sessions?

133
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.260
It could be because only Nishikido-kun was
winning a bunch of games and had ranked up.

134
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.810
Everyone wants to play stronger
opponents when they advance in rank.

135
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.690
By the way, why did Kishimoto
become depressed?

136
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.740
B-Because...

137
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.070
I think it's because my
brother Kinji killed himself.

138
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.990
He killed himself?

139
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.070
Why?

140
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.930
I don't know.

141
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.950
Not only that, but Kinji-san was doing great
at the time and winning a bunch of games.

142
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.060
We were so certain he'd rank up
that we even celebrated beforehand.

143
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.210
Mina was dating my brother.

144
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.260
So you don't know why he did it?

145
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.690
N-No.

146
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.720
Just before he died, he said someone
from the Shogi League asked to meet him.

147
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.920
Kishimoto-san became depressed
after Kinji killed himself.

148
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.610
He really looked up to Kinji.

149
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:57.110
After that, I was invited
to join the study sessions

150
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.740
because they didn't have enough
members, and I invited the girls.

151
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.900
These two were totally disheartened
after Kinji's death,

152
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.620
so I also invited them to cheer them up.

153
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.680
In any case, it sounds like
we'll have to talk to Kishimoto.

154
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.880
He may know why Uryu killed himself.

155
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.670
And his suicide may be connected to the
murders of those two shogi players.

156
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.410
Those two may not be the only ones.

157
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.220
There are two legs left on the shogi board.

158
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.000
Y-You mean there's going to be more murders?

159
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.640
No way.

160
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.150
You're kidding, right?

161
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.030
Hey!

162
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.040
What are you scaring them for?

163
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.870
But I bet that's what
Shinichi-niichan would say.

164
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.720
Do you know Kishimoto's address?

165
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.250
Not his exact address, but I think he lives
in a detached house next to the public bath.

166
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.620
The public bath?

167
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.380
It's quicker to show you.

168
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.090
Next to the black chimney
you can see from here is...

169
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.840
Wait, I see smoke.

170
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.470
Isn't that around Kishimoto's house?

171
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.840
C-Could it be?

172
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.060
Is Kishimoto-san their next target?

173
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.400
But why?

174
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.020
In any case, let's head there.

175
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.690
Return to your homes and wait there.

176
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.570
Don't do anything without
speaking to us first.

177
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.320
And don't forget that your
lives could be in danger, too.

178
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.660
Inspector Yuminaga.

179
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.420
What's the situation?

180
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.500
We avoided a total loss, but the resident
who was inside was burnt to a crisp.

181
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.030
Since no vital signs were
detected in the body,

182
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.050
he seems to have died
before the fire started.

183
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.570
Forensics said it's possible he was alive
until shortly before the fire started

184
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:51.230
because his rectal temperature
hadn't fallen much.

185
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.360
Shortly before?

186
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.730
You mean he died after that shogi player
was murdered at the Beika City apartment?

187
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.610
I heard from Megure that a shogi
board was found at the crime scene.

188
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.900
We actually found one here, too.

189
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.500
A shogi board missing three legs.

190
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.240
So they really are serial murders.

191
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.500
Right after Genda's murder.

192
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.760
But now we can't ask him about the suicide.

193
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.840
Let's check out other people
who may have known him.

194
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.720
Hey.

195
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.720
More importantly, what's
Conan-kun doing here?

196
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.730
Oh, uh, he snuck into the
patrol car at some point.

197
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.840
I'm sorry for dropping by suddenly.

198
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.060
So this is where you moved to.

199
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.380
What's this?

200
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.450
You look like you don't
know why I turned up here.

201
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.590
The truth is, I came to encourage
you to turn yourself in.

202
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:01.550
You're the one who killed Genda-san at
the apartment in Beika City, aren't you?

203
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.080
These serial murders are targeting
professional shogi players.

204
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.190
What these murders have in common is the
shogi board left at every crime scene.

205
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:24.060
Next to the missing shogi player
Nishikido suspected of match fixing

206
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.200
who was found bludgeoned to death was
a shogi board missing one leg.

207
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:34.010
Near the head of Genda, who was found
strangled to death in a Beika City apartment,

208
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.810
was a shogi board missing two legs.

209
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:44.740
And immediately after that, Kishimoto was
found dead after his house caught fire,

210
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.350
and a shogi board missing three
legs was discovered at the scene.

211
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.680
The potential suspects are the
three people who left Genda

212
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.840
at the second crime scene to go shopping.

213
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.980
Hishinuma Kosuke bought enough hot
coffee for everyone at a coffee shop,

214
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.880
Katsumata Mina bought freshly baked bread,

215
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.390
and Uryu Shoko bought ice cream.

216
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.680
They all drank Hishinuma-san's coffee
at the apartment building entrance

217
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.480
and commented that the flavor had declined
in quality and the coffee was cold.

218
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.320
He could've used lukewarm water
and instant coffee to make that,

219
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.760
but the hot water heater and electric kettle
were both broken and wouldn't give hot water,

220
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.550
and the stove wasn't warm.

221
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.020
There were no signs that anyone
had boiled water on it.

222
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.340
The same can be said of the
hot bread Mina-san bought.

223
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.800
In that room without a microwave, it
would've been impossible to heat up that bread.

224
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.280
The ice cream Shoko-san
bought seemed to be cold,

225
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.290
but with a cooler, she could've kept
ice cream purchased beforehand cold.

226
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.720
But when we arrived at the room,
all three were dressed lightly.

227
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.800
It's hard to believe they were
carrying anything like that.

228
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.760
Not only that, but only Genda-san
and Mina-san had keys to the room.

229
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.810
Shoko-san couldn't have arrived
early and left a cooler in the room.

230
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:21.810
Naturally, Hishinuma-san couldn't
have left a thermos in there either.

231
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.460
Could any of them have killed
Kishimoto in the first place?

232
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:33.260
Together we discovered Genda-san's
body in the Beika City apartment.

233
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.830
After an investigation by the
police who arrived at the scene,

234
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.150
we began discussing the
location of Kishimoto's home.

235
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.450
By the time we looked out the
window to confirm the location

236
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:49.380
and noticed Kishimoto's house was
on fire, three hours had elapsed.

237
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.590
Those three were with us the whole time.

238
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.720
Kishimoto's body discovered at the scene
of the fire showed no vital signs,

239
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.160
which means he died before the fire started.

240
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.670
But since Inspector Yuminaga said the body's
rectal temperature hadn't fallen completely yet,

241
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.560
it's likely he was still alive until
shortly before the fire started.

242
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.030
That would make it impossible for
those three to have killed Kishimoto.

243
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.620
This is impossible. Aw, man.

244
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.120
What's impossible, Genta-kun?

245
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.740
It's this Yaiba capsule toys.

246
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.290
I got a #1 the day before
yesterday and a #2 yesterday,

247
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.510
so I was sure I'd get a #3 today,

248
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.510
but I got another #1.

249
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.700
I bet these capsules are rigged
not to give you a #3.

250
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.020
Genta-kun, things don't always
happen so conveniently in order.

251
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.840
Maybe I'd get one if I mixed them up.

252
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.830
You'll get in trouble.

253
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.220
It'll be fine.

254
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.450
It'll be fine.
Please don't get worked up over capsule toys.

255
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.910
Please don't get worked up over capsule toys.

256
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.840
I've got this.
What? Are you interested
in capsule toys, too?

257
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.420
What? Are you interested
in capsule toys, too?

258
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.510
No, it's not that.

259
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.040
You're going to break it.

260
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.060
I feel like I just received
an incredible hint.

261
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.710
Huh? Someone's calling.

262
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.040
It's Yumi-san.

263
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.100
Hello, Yumi-san? What is it?

264
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.260
Don't do that.

265
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.200
What?

266
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.890
Taiko Meijin hasn't come home?

267
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.650
Not since last night?

268
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.690
Yeah, late last night he said he'd be out late
since he was meeting a friend and headed out.

269
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.650
I went to sleep without
waiting for him to return,

270
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.580
but he wasn't there when I woke up.

271
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.180
I thought he must've come home and
left again early in the morning,

272
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.910
but I've asked around and nobody's seen him.

273
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.920
Did you call those three shogi players?

274
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.260
Yeah.

275
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.250
I tried calling, but none
of them said they knew.

276
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.920
I thought you might know, so I called you.

277
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.320
Come to think of it, Taiko
Meijin had an odd expression

278
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.440
on his face after we discovered the
body and before the police arrived.

279
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.430
Is it possible that he noticed something?

280
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:10.240
Was Taiko Meijin acting strange when you
left the apartment where the murder occurred?

281
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.190
I wouldn't call it strange exactly.

282
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.980
When we left the apartment
with the three shogi players,

283
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:23.500
Chukichi suddenly said he forgot something
and borrowed the key and headed back inside.

284
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.710
I asked him what he forget when he came
back, but he said it was a mistake on his part.

285
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.130
What is it? What did the Meijin see?

286
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.280
Well, whatever. I'll try
calling someone else.

287
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.560
Hey, wait!

288
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.820
Maybe he's shocked you
suspected him of cheating.

289
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.600
It sounds like he wasn't cheating after all.

290
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.610
I just tailed him a little. Could you
guys not make a huge fuss over this?

291
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.500
"Just tailed him a little?"

292
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.360
You're not a detective.

293
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.720
You guys are lucky you get along so well.

294
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.480
Uh...

295
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.570
Actually...

296
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.770
Naeko-chan and I just got into
a huge argument last night

297
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.540
because of a difference in opinion.

298
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:08.250
Because you laughed and called me an idiot
because I served cream stew over rice.

299
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.650
Nobody does that. It's not curry.

300
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.030
It's all the same once it's in your stomach,
and that way you only have to wash one dish.

301
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.800
It's annoying how in love they are.

302
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.200
Where am I?

303
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.090
Last night I went to see them, and then...

304
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.140
The truth is, I came to encourage
you to turn yourself in.

305
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.900
Why don't we talk about this inside?

306
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.870
They knocked me out with a stun
gun, and then I ended up like this.

307
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.710
My hands are tied behind my back, but
my phone is still in my back pocket.

308
00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.390
I can get it out, but I doubt
I'll be able to call anyone.

309
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.960
They look pretty irritated.

310
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.510
They seem to be waiting for
the police announcement.

311
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.870
But I've crushed that path to victory.

312
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.210
Kudo

313
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.480
Kudo
How unusual for you to call me, kid.

314
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.480
How unusual for you to call me, kid.

315
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.300
Shin-chan's calling?

316
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.170
What?

317
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.740
Shukichi's missing after
getting involved in a murder?

318
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.840
Yeah.

319
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.340
Taiko Meijin might've identified
the culprit and gone to see them.

320
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.680
All three suspects are
shogi players like him,

321
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.870
so he probably wanted to convince
them to turn themselves in.

322
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.730
Tell me more about the case.

323
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:08.440
Could you put your phone on
speaker so I can listen, too?

324
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.170
I've got nothing better to do.

325
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.270
The world's leading mystery enthusiast
is currently at your disposal.

326
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.360
I see.

327
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.270
So as the number of victims increases, the
number of legs on the shogi board decreases.

328
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.360
But you already know the number
of legs is a feint, right?

329
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.280
Yeah, but like I said earlier,
all three of them have alibis.

330
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.290
You said Akai-kun's brother seemed
to have noticed something.

331
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.600
What made you think that?

332
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.590
When the Meijin moved around the people
in front of him to get a look at the body,

333
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.170
he touched the kitchen counter.

334
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.590
He held his hand as though
he'd touched something.

335
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.450
I don't know if it was hot or cold,
but his expression changed then.

336
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.640
What was on top of the kitchen counter then?

337
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.690
Nothing significant.

338
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.040
Just two ice trays, a mixer,
and a toaster, I think.

339
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:17.450
Sounds like there was a magic tool one of
them could've used to fabricate an alibi.

340
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.960
What? Which one of those sounds like—

341
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.680
Oh, right.

342
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.410
In any case, sounds like we need to hurry.

343
00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:32.310
Meet up with Akai-kun and make
sure his brother is safe.

344
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.470
We're counting on you, Edogawa Conan-kun.

345
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.570
Yeah, I know.

blind shogi game to tell us where he's being held.

355

359
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.560
Blind Shogi

360
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.940
Blind Shogi
Next Conan's hint!

361
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.910
