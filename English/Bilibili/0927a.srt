1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,870
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,770
Last year, the comic, TV anime, movie,

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,370
and various events were met with great enthusiasm.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,570
In particular, the movie "Zero the Enforcer" was a huge hit.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,470
We have all of you who support us to thank for that.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,970
We'll be working even harder this year,

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,070
so we appreciate your continued support.

8
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,570
Hold on, Sonoko.

9
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,170
Come on. It's been forever.

10
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,570
No...

11
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,970
Give me a break!

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,470
Come on. I'll take a romantic photo of you two.

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,670
Let's take one of all of us.

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,170
Nope.

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,470
Feel free to share a passionate kiss, missus.

16
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,970
What?

17
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,170
In any case...

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,070
Go on!

19
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,870
"The Scarlet School Trip: Bright Red and Red Love Arcs"

20
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:48,273
"The Scarlet School Trip (Bright Red Arc)"

21
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,973
Sorry for bumping into you.

22
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,373
Did it hurt?

23
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,573
You probably shouldn't get too close to me.

24
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,273
I told you, I have a bit of a cold.

25
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,373
Are you okay?

26
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,673
I brought some cold medicine.

27
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:06,273
I'm fine.

28
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:08,373
Dr. Agasa gave me some medicine.

29
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,373
Look at you two.

30
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,673
Are you planning tonight's tryst?

31
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,073
Sonoko!

32
00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:16,573
If you don't cut it out, I'm really going to get mad.

33
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:22,773
You're even cute when you're angry, missus.

34
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,173
Oh, no.

35
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:27,973
I'd only been looking up at her from a low angle recently,

36
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,973
so I was starting to forget,

37
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,973
but seeing her up close...

38
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,473
Hey, you.

39
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:38,873
Are you really Shinichi Kudo?

40
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:40,273
Yeah.

41
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:44,473
What?

42
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:48,573
You remember me, don't you?

43
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,573
Huh? Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,973
Didn't we meet on the beach when we were kids?

45
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,773
It's been ten years, right?

46
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,573
Ten years?

47
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,673
Has it really been that long?

48
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,773
Huh? Yeah, of course.

49
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:06,773
Sera, we're going to the Kiyomizu butai.

50
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,273
Okay.

51
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,473
See you later.

52
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:12,473
We can have a nice long chat then.

53
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:14,773
-Sure. -Hey, Kudo.

54
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:15,873
We sure got lucky.

55
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:18,473
Nakamichi, what do you mean?

56
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:23,173
Three of the Teitan High School popularity contest's top ten girls

57
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,673
are in our group.

58
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:30,073
Really? A popularity contest, huh?

59
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:32,273
What rank was Ran?

60
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:36,773
Since you confessed your feelings to Ran in London,

61
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,573
I'll pass on her out of respect for you.

62
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:39,973
You idiot.

63
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:42,873
Sonoko's got a really strong boyfriend,

64
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:45,373
and Sera's a Jeet Kune Do...

65
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:49,173
What? How do you know I confessed my feelings?

66
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:51,473
Suzuki told everyone.

67
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:55,173
-What? -She said we should support you guys.

68
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,273
Gosh, that Sonoko...

69
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,273
Anyway, Kudo...

70
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,873
I'm surprised you were able to come on the school trip.

71
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:04,173
I didn't think you'd come.

72
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:05,373
Yeah.

73
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,273
It took a lot to get here.

74
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:12,873
That's not why we did it,

75
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:16,573
but if you don't mind, the medicine to restore my body...

76
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:20,073
Absolutely not!

77
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,473
I didn't think so.

78
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:27,073
Do you have a cold?

79
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:28,073
No.

80
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:31,173
Conan jumped into the sea

81
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,873
when the strap nearly fell into the water.

82
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,973
It ended up belonging to someone else, though.

83
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:39,173
And he kept looking even though his clothes were wet.

84
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:43,273
Come to think of it, you kids seem a little dirty, too.

85
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:45,973
We were looking under cars and stuff, too.

86
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:47,673
We did it for Ai.

87
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:49,473
We're totally fine.

88
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:51,873
Yeah...

89
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,973
If it's to help Haibara...

90
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:56,073
-We know. -I don't mind getting this dirty at all.

91
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:05,673
I guess I'll have to give up on the school trip.

92
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:09,373
I wouldn't want people to know Shinichi Kudo is still alive.

93
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:12,673
It hurts!

94
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,873
What was that for, Haibara?

95
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,773
I'll give you the medicine.

96
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:18,073
Really?

97
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:22,473
But you have to do as I say.

98
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:23,573
Got it?

99
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,773
Yeah, yeah. I know.

100
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:32,473
What a nice view.

101
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:37,673
Yeah, but this place isn't too high up.

102
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:39,573
Looks like about 12 meters.

103
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,573
Sera, don't lean over so far. It's dangerous.

104
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:48,073
Apparently, someone jumped to their death from here the other day.

105
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:49,173
Really?

106
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:51,073
So?

107
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,673
Have you responded to Shinichi's confession?

108
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:54,873
What?

109
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:59,273
Not yet.

110
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:03,273
Then you really should kiss him here.

111
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:06,173
Imagine you're leaping off the Kiyomizu butai.

112
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,573
I can't do that!

113
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:11,773
What's going on? Ran, are you going to jump off?

114
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,773
It's a matter of motivation.

115
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:22,173
You just wait, Dekuri.

116
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,673
It won't be long now.

117
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:35,373
Excuse me, are you the actress Keiko Kurachi?

118
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,073
"Keiko Kurachi(37), Actress" -I came here secretly.

119
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:40,373
Don't tell anyone.

120
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,073
Sure.

121
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,373
Is she a celebrity?

122
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,573
Can we take a picture with you?

123
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,473
Yes, as long as we do it quietly.

124
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,073
Thank you.

125
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:52,073
Shinichi, Nakamichi, come here.

126
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,873
Let's take a picture together.

127
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:56,773
Shinichi?

128
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:01,573
Thank you...

129
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:03,673
Hey, you.

130
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,473
Are you Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective?

131
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:09,473
Yes.

132
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:11,673
You're Yukiko's son, aren't you?

133
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:14,073
-Yes, that's me. -I thought so.

134
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:17,173
I've changed your diaper before.

135
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:20,273
-Are you here on a school trip? -Yes.

136
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,273
Hey, missus. Your husband's cheating on you.

137
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:25,073
They seem to know each other.

138
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:28,173
No way. We're staying in the same hotel.

139
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:31,173
We? Are you here with someone?

140
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,573
Yes.

141
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:35,073
Some college classmates and I came

142
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,773
to pay our respects to an old friend.

143
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,873
I say classmates, but they're all celebrities, too.

144
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,173
Really?

145
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,673
I know. Since we're staying in the same hotel,

146
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,673
could you come to my room tonight?

147
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:48,973
What?

148
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:50,873
There's something I want to show you.

149
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,573
Show me what?

150
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,573
It's a cipher.

151
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,573
Detectives love those, right?

152
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,473
Come see me around nine tonight.

153
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:02,973
Here. This is my room number.

154
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,373
She gave him something.

155
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:11,873
I was going to ask Yukiko's husband.

156
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:13,773
Are you too busy?

157
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,873
No, it's totally fine!

158
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:17,673
It's decided, then.

159
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:20,173
You can bring your girlfriend, too.

160
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,273
She's that long-haired girl over there, right?

161
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,673
She's been staring at us this whole time.

162
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,873
See you later.

163
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,973
I'll be waiting. You have to come.

164
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,273
Okay.

165
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:38,073
Wait, Ran!

166
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:42,273
Tonight at nine?

167
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,873
That's cutting it close.

168
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,159
"Purify your body and mind, Beautifying Water"

169
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:02,659
"Momoyama Palace, Bloody Ceiling"

170
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:05,359
Please look up at the ceiling.

171
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:08,759
The general staying at Fushimi Castle at this time...

172
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,159
Wow. So this is the bloody ceiling.

173
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,759
It's an ancient murder scene.

174
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,759
It figures a high school girl detective would say that.

175
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,959
Hey.

176
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,159
Let's keep moving.

177
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,859
Don't worry. It won't drip on us.

178
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,059
I know that.

179
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,459
Besides, it was painted on the ceiling

180
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,359
to memorialize the men who died in battle.

181
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:33,559
You should look at it and pray for them.

182
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,359
You're right.

183
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,159
Oh, man.

184
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,759
This is too much fun.

185
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,059
What number is Kurachi's room?

186
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,459
-It's room 1506. -I'm sorry about the poster, Mai.

187
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,759
It can't be helped.

188
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,859
They've been friends since college, right?

189
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:08,359
-Besides, I heard that movie... -Mai Kuraki!

190
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,659
-is a remake of one they made in college. -Who?

191
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,359
If my name appeared alongside theirs on the movie poster,

192
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,959
it would look like I forced them to do it,

193
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,759
even though I sang the theme song.

194
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,859
I'm glad they turned us down.

195
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,459
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,559
I thought it'd be a good opportunity to promote you.

197
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,559
Are you kids in high school?

198
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,659
Are you on a school trip?

199
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,759
Yeah.

200
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,359
I see. That's nice.

201
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:41,159
A double date on a school trip, huh?

202
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,759
Oh, to be young.

203
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,959
You made my heart skip a beat.

204
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,659
A double date?

205
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,259
-I thought I was going to die. -Sorry.

206
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:01,259
Coming!

207
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,259
Welcome.

208
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,459
Huh?

209
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,059
You brought more than just her.

210
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,459
Sorry. When I told them I was meeting you,

211
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,759
they insisted on coming.

212
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,159
Hello!

213
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,659
Should I not have brought them?

214
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,859
No, it's totally fine.

215
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,559
The more, the merrier, right?

216
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,659
I'll crack that code for you.

217
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,359
She's a detective, too.

218
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,159
A high school girl detective.

219
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,359
Really? How promising.

220
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,759
Excuse me.

221
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,259
You wear your hat inside, too?

222
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,759
Oh, this?

223
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,559
I tripped during filming and got a bump on my head.

224
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,859
Were you filming for your movie that comes out this weekend?

225
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:39,659
That's right.

226
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,159
"The Fighting Red Tengu."

227
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,559
"Shinya Ihaya (37), Actor" -The highlight of...

228
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,259
this historical fantasy film is its star, me.

229
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,659
No, no.

230
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,659
I believe the highlight of the film...

231
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,359
"Mineto Mayama (38), Movie Director" -is me, the director.

232
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,159
No...

233
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,159
I thought the selling point of the film

234
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,059
"Riki Agata (37), Composer" -was my music.

235
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,459
What are you talking about?

236
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,659
This movie doesn't exist without its star.

237
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:02,959
You're wrong.

238
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,859
People have always said a movie is made by its director.

239
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:08,359
They really are all celebrities.

240
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,759
That's right.

241
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,659
They're all my friends from college.

242
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,259
So, what's this cipher you mentioned?

243
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,559
Oh, right.

244
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,959
Our scriptwriter Nishiki has it.

245
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,959
Let's go to his room together.

246
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,059
Yeah.

247
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:30,059
This is the cipher I received last week.

248
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,759
Let me take a look.

249
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,259
The envelope the cipher came in

250
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:37,559
also contained a dried paper plant leaf.

251
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,759
Excuse me.

252
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,059
Do you know what these four black squares

253
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:44,459
at the top of the cipher mean?

254
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,759
Yeah.

255
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,059
That's the mark of Dekuri, the guy who came up with that cipher.

256
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:54,059
He drew that mark on his notebooks and bags.

257
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,559
Then can't you ask that Dekuri person

258
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,259
for the meaning of the cipher?

259
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,759
We can't anymore.

260
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,059
The other day,

261
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:06,159
he jumped to his death from the Kiyomizu butai.

262
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,459
What?

263
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,659
I thought that cipher was a message he left to me

264
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,659
before he killed himself.

265
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,959
That's why I wanted you to decipher it.

266
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,759
Hey, kids.

267
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,959
We're going to get dinner in the hotel lounge.

268
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,959
If you want to know more, why don't you come with us?

269
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,259
No, thanks. We'll pass.

270
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,259
Then text me when you figure out the cipher.

271
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:34,559
Got it.

272
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,459
That's a pretty bare-bones cipher.

273
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,559
And the characters are arranged crookedly.

274
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,159
There's probably some meaning to those crooked spaces.

275
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,359
Come to think of it,

276
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,159
I wonder what the paper plant leaf in the envelope was about.

277
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,059
Tengu often carry paper plant leaves, right?

278
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,559
It's from Keiko.

279
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,159
Come on. I haven't decoded the cipher yet.

280
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:08,059
"Shinichi, hurry! Come to Nishiki's room!"

281
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,659
What happened, Keiko?

282
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,459
He's been stabbed.

283
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,959
And there are bumps on his head.

284
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,559
Didn't you say you were getting dinner in the lounge?

285
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,559
Yeah.

286
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,759
After that, we returned to our rooms to get ready.

287
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,359
We were supposed to meet at this room

288
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,159
in ten minutes before heading down.

289
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,159
He wouldn't answer the door

290
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,459
no matter how many times we rang the bell,

291
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,959
so we had a bellhop unlock it.

292
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,559
That's how we found him.

293
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,959
What is it?

294
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,259
Something fell on my shoulder.

295
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,359
It looks just like the bloody ceiling.

296
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:10,059
Yeah, and the footprints on the ceiling lead to the window.

297
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:12,759
Most likely the culprit wanted it to seem like

298
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,359
he lifted the victim to the ceiling to stab him,

299
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:19,559
walked across the ceiling to the window,

300
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,659
and vanished from the window of this 15th floor room,

301
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,759
as though a monster with wings capable of flight

302
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,959
and magic powers capable of manipulating human bodies

303
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,759
committed this crime.

304
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:52,857
You mean a tengu?

305
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:55,457
Are you saying Nishiki was killed by a tengu?

306
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:57,057
Don't be ridiculous!

307
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:02,157
But a monster with magic powers who can fly...

308
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:05,357
What are you talking about? Those don't actually exist!

309
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,057
But it's the only possible explanation.

310
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,157
Tengu are imaginary creatures.

311
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:11,157
They only exist within movies

312
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,957
like the one we were filming until recently.

313
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:19,357
Are you saying Nishiki was killed by a fictional monster?

314
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,457
Either way, it seems like the culprit

315
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,757
wanted it to look like the work of a tengu.

316
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,657
There's a paper plant leaf in the victim's jacket,

317
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,157
which tengu often carry.

318
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,757
And a new cipher as well.

319
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:42,157
Maybe the similar cipher Nishiki received last week

320
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:44,957
was a warning.

321
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,057
A warning?

322
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:50,957
Hold on. If there's a new code...

323
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:53,957
Does that mean someone else will be killed?

324
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:59,657
Is it possible this Dekuri person who came up with the code hated you?

325
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:04,557
That's not possible. Right?

326
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:05,757
Yeah.

327
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:11,757
Either way, this is probably the work of someone unhappy

328
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:16,357
with your movie "The Fighting Tengu" that comes out this weekend.

329
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:20,357
The movie's script is scattered all over the floor.

330
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:24,357
By the way,

331
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:29,257
what are these smooth pieces of paper stuck all over the script?

332
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,457
They're labels.

333
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:37,057
Nishiki had been using that type of label recently

334
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:40,557
since they were easy to stick on and take off.

335
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:42,857
Since the movie's going to be novelized,

336
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:45,257
Nishiki brought the script to the hotel

337
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,357
so he could make adjustments.

338
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,157
I see.

339
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:53,157
He was so excited to finish it before the movie opened.

340
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:57,857
Excuse me.

341
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,457
Hello?

342
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:03,957
You said you planned to meet at this room

343
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,757
in ten minutes before going to dinner.

344
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:09,657
Who was first to arrive at the room?

345
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:12,557
Me and Agata.

346
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:16,357
By the time we arrived, he wasn't answering his door.

347
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,357
If that's true,

348
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:24,457
then the culprit killed Nishiki and sprayed the ceiling

349
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:28,057
with blood during those ten minutes.

350
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:34,357
Yeah. That blood wasn't there when we came here earlier.

351
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:39,157
Did you call the police?

352
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:44,057
The bellhop who unlocked the door called the police for us.

353
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:48,557
He just called to say a Kyoto Police inspector named Ayanokoji

354
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:50,757
would be coming.

355
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,957
Inspector Ayanokoji of the Kyoto Police, huh?

356
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:58,357
He's an odd inspector with a pet chipmunk,

357
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:00,057
but he's a smart man.

358
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,557
We don't have to worry about...

359
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:07,257
Is something wrong?

360
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:09,357
No, it's nothing.

361
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,757
-Hey. -This isn't good.

362
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,157
The medicine's wearing off.

363
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,057
Are you okay?

364
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:18,857
Yeah.

365
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:22,557
In any case, the rest is up to you, Sera.

366
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:23,757
Hey!

367
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,757
Are you okay?

368
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:29,957
Yes. The police will handle the rest.

369
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:31,657
I'll leave Sera with you.

370
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,757
-If you need anything, talk to her. -Okay.

371
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:36,057
Shinichi.

372
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:37,757
You look pale.

373
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,657
Is it that bad inside?

374
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:44,357
Yeah. Don't go in there.

375
00:20:44,357 --> 00:20:45,457
Shinichi!

376
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,257
Don't follow me!

377
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,057
My cold returned with a vengeance.

378
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:53,157
I don't want you to get sick.

379
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:56,557
I should be fine after a good night's sleep. Don't worry.

380
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,557
I can't turn back into Conan in front of Ran.

381
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:04,557
Shinichi...

382
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:12,357
Yes! First one out!

383
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,857
Gosh!

384
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,157
Is it a teacher coming to check on us?

385
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:20,357
Seriously?

386
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:22,657
This isn't good. Kudo's not here.

387
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,057
Answer the door, Nakamichi.

388
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:28,457
-Me? -Of course. This is your room.

389
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,657
We'll clean this up.

390
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,257
I'm coming.

391
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:37,057
Sorry, sir.

392
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,757
It's just you, Kudo.

393
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:43,657
Sorry, Nakamichi.

394
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:46,557
I forgot my key inside the room.

395
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:47,957
Don't scare us like that.

396
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:50,557
We thought you were a teacher.

397
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,157
Anyway, how'd it go?

398
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:55,957
How was meeting the great actress Keiko Kurachi?

399
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:59,057
I... I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

400
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:01,857
I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep.

401
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:02,857
Don't wake me.

402
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:06,157
Seriously? We were looking forward to hearing about it.

403
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,757
You're only interested in idols, Nakamichi.

404
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:10,257
Well, yeah.

405
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:12,557
Let's keep playing.

406
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:15,657
Your win earlier doesn't count, Nakamichi.

407
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:17,057
Why not?

408
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:20,557
We mixed up the cards because we thought a teacher came to check on us.

409
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,957
Then you guys can play the rest of the round yourselves.

410
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:28,957
Are you okay, Kudo?

411
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:30,557
Leave him be.

412
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,757
He's just excited because he finally got to see his wife again.

413
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:35,057
Oh, right.

414
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:36,157
Ran!

415
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:38,857
Shinichi! I missed you!

416
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,357
Those idiots are always doing as they please.

417
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:45,757
Hey, you can come out now.

418
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:48,157
Just so you know, Kudo,

419
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,357
you really owe me for this.

420
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:54,257
Yeah, I know. Make sure no one finds out.

421
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:56,057
You can count on me.

422
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,657
Oh, right. Hey, Kudo.

423
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:05,657
Before you go to sleep, tell us about your confession to Ran in London.

424
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:11,157
Don't be shy, Kudo.

425
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,157
You're not asleep yet, are you?

426
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:16,457
Did you guys kiss?

427
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,757
If you don't tell us, I'll rip off the covers.

428
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:22,757
Yeah. Of course we kissed, you moron.

429
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:25,657
They really did it?

430
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:26,957
They kissed?

431
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:29,357
Why do you have a Kansai accent?

432
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,857
When in Rome, do as the Romans do, you know?

433
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:35,457
You guys had better learn to speak in a Kansai accent, too.

434
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,757
Sure.

435
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:39,157
-They kissed? -Lucky.

436
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,457
Lucky.

437
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:45,957
I'd better keep my voice changer on me starting tomorrow.

438
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:50,857
Following Haibara's rules isn't easy.

439
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:52,857
Listen closely.

440
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:55,457
The following three rules are important.

441
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:57,157
Don't take the next dose immediately

442
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:58,757
when the medicine wears off.

443
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:01,357
You have to wait eight hours.

444
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,557
Come up with a plan so the people around you

445
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:06,857
won't notice when you turn into a child.

446
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:11,357
Don't draw attention to yourself when you're Shinichi Kudo.

447
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:15,357
And don't flirt too much.

448
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:17,357
Don't flirt?

449
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:19,857
Wasn't that four things?

450
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:22,957
Well, the fourth one's not important.

451
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:24,857
But following the first three

452
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:28,157
is my condition for giving you the APTX 4869 antidote.

453
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:30,357
Eight more hours.

454
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:33,657
This is going to be long.

455
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:37,057
Oh, right. I should show Hattori.

456
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:45,757
A message?

457
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,457
What's this?

458
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,157
A cipher?

459
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,157
I see.

460
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:59,457
The high school detective Shinichi Kudo mentioned me?

461
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,057
Yeah. He said not to worry since you're a smart inspector.

462
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,057
"Fumimaro Ayanokoji (28)" -I appreciate it.

463
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:08,157
That's odd, though.

464
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,757
I've never met Kudo before.

465
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:13,257
He really does have a pet chipmunk.

466
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:16,057
Perhaps Conan told him about me.

467
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:21,257
Should a police officer be bringing a pet to a crime scene?

468
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:24,657
This is quite the brutal murder.

469
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,657
Not only was he stabbed in the heart,

470
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:29,557
but he has two bumps on his head.

471
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:33,957
It will take some time to examine the crime scene.

472
00:25:33,957 --> 00:25:38,157
Could you please wait in your rooms?

473
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:42,357
After all, the victim and the suspects are all celebrities.

474
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:46,957
I'm sure there will be quite the commotion tomorrow morning.

475
00:26:08,057 --> 00:26:11,257
Come to think of it, I slept under the bed.

476
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,457
It's been eight hours.

477
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:19,257
Time for my medicine.

478
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:38,157
Will I make it until the end of the school trip?

479
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:45,457
These guys didn't go back to their rooms?

480
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,957
Gosh.

481
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,457
It's Keiko.

482
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:52,657
"Shinichi, help! Agata's in trouble now!"

483
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:54,457
Something happened to Agata?

484
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:58,657
Hey, Hattori! Wake up!

485
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:00,757
No, I can't eat anymore.

486
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,657
Hattori, it's a case!

487
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:08,457
Did Agata really say that?

488
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:10,757
Yes. He was shouting loudly enough

489
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:12,757
that I could hear him from the neighboring room.

490
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,157
Shouting, "Help me! He's going to kill me!"

491
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:16,657
Seriously?

492
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:18,057
Keiko!

493
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,157
Shinichi.

494
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:21,957
You're Shinichi Kudo?

495
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:25,657
Oh? That boy next to you is

496
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:29,857
the Osaka Police chief's son Heiji Hattori.

497
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,657
What are you doing here?

498
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:33,857
Kudo invited me to come hang out.

499
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:35,557
I just happened to be here.

500
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:37,257
Anyway, what happened?

501
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:41,257
Agata was heard shouting something rather strange inside his room.

502
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:43,557
This bellhop is unlocking the door for us.

503
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:45,857
-It's open. -Thank you.

504
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:49,157
He's probably having nightmares

505
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:52,957
after seeing last night's crime scene and moaning in his sleep.

506
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:55,757
Agata, are you all right?

507
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,857
We're coming in.

508
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:59,157
Agata.

509
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:04,157
Please don't!

510
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:07,457
A tengu?

511
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:09,957
Forgive me.

512
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,657
Forgive me!

513
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,157
Hey, you got any weapons?

514
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:15,557
No.

515
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,657
Stay back! Stay back!

516
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:19,357
Darn it!

517
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:20,957
Stay back!

518
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:26,757
It... it disappeared!

519
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,457
It went up in flames and vanished!

520
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,157
No way!

521
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:32,957
Hey, Kudo.

522
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:36,157
We're not still asleep, are we?
