1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,600
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,550
Conan's logic works wonders on
hearts exhausted by modern society!

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,300
Today's hints are crabs and a whale!
Unexpected things look like them!

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,180
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,060
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,279
The Crabs and Whale Kidnapping Case.

7
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,939
Cheers!

8
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,449
Tastes great! Can't have
summer without beer!

9
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:04,389
Dad! You shouldn't just drink!
You need to eat a little!

10
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,619
Yeah, yeah. Don't be so naggy.

11
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,499
I was all excited when he said
it was a fancy hotel dinner,

12
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:14,299
but it's nothing but light snacks!

13
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:18,849
Who takes kids
to beer gardens to eat?

14
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:26,389
Dentist - Endo Keigo (33)

15
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:36,069
That man's at a beer garden
but hasn't even had a sip...

16
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,059
Are you drunk already?!

17
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,419
No...

18
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,479
Where are you going?

19
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,129
Bathroom.

20
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:56,929
The bathrooms aren't that way!
Really, now...

21
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,909
This way!

22
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,059
Alright...

23
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:14,989
This is Endo...

24
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:19,329
Yes. Yes. I'm alone.

25
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,069
What?!

26
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,579
Why is the deal off?! I got the
money and didn't tell the police!

27
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,299
Wait! Let me hear Keita again! Hello?!

28
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,969
Did this man--

29
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,349
Old man! Ran-neechan!

30
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,259
Let's get out of here!

31
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,809
What's the matter, Conan-kun?

32
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,029
I can't say it out loud,
but I think there was a kidnapping!

33
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:00,489
What?!

34
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:18,139
Just as you said, there's a good
chance they're holding him for ransom.

35
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,089
Yeah. It sounds like he
hasn't contacted the police.

36
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:27,059
Driver. Try not to lose
the taxi in front of us.

37
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,099
Right.

38
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,559
Endo Dental Clinic

39
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,719
Closed for today.

40
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,259
A dentist, huh...
Closed for today.

41
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:50,639
Closed for today.

42
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,639
What now, Dad?

43
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,309
We need to talk with him first...

44
00:04:57,309 --> 00:05:00,719
But we don't know where
the kidnapper is looking from,

45
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,559
and it could be
a neighbor behind this.

46
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:05,639
We'll need to be careful.

47
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:09,599
I have a good idea!
I'll be a patient!

48
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,559
Patient?

49
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,469
Alright, start.

50
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:20,599
My tooth hurts! It hurts!

51
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:26,949
Hold on! Dad's going to
talk to the dentist!

52
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:30,929
No, I can't hold on! It hurts!

53
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:31,969
Yes?

54
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:34,889
I'm sorry to bother you
on your day off.

55
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,059
My kid's tooth hurts and
he won't shut up about it.

56
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,669
Could you look at it?

57
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,129
I can't stand it!

58
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:47,389
Understood. Please come inside.

59
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,059
It hurts! It hurts!

60
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,559
Please come in.

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,429
I apologize...

62
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,399
Ouch--

63
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:00,979
Ouch!

64
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,699
Knock it off! That's enough!

65
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,159
Please come into
the examination room...

66
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:14,079
Pardon my late introduction.
I am Detective Mori Kogoro.

67
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:18,539
Mori Kogoro? That famous detective?!

68
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:28,139
I see. So Conan-kun heard
my phone conversation--

69
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,309
Endo-san. Could you tell me about it?

70
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,849
If the kid's right,
then I can help you.

71
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:42,719
Alright. This may be
some sort of fate.

72
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,279
Just as you said,
my son was kidnapped.

73
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,239
His name is Keita.

74
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:53,309
I let him play by himself in
the front yard this afternoon, but...

75
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:56,529
Keita! Let's go to the park!

76
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,009
Keita?

77
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,799
"Took the kid. Call the police
and he's dead. Wait for a call."

78
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,559
It's written on ordinary copy paper.

79
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,849
So what did the kidnapper tell you?

80
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,599
It was a young man's
voice on the phone.

81
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,719
He told me to put 30 million
yen in used bills in a briefcase

82
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,389
and to be at Starlight
Hotel's beer garden at 6:00.

83
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:40,829
But a little after 6:00, he called
me and cancelled the exchange.

84
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,929
Did he explain why?

85
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:49,219
No. All he said was that he would
call again tomorrow morning.

86
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,889
Maybe the kidnapper was suspicious?

87
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,309
He probably never intended
to get the money tonight.

88
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,179
He likely watched Endo-san from
somewhere in the beer garden

89
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,559
to make sure he hadn't
contacted the police.

90
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,099
When you got the first call,
did you hear Keita-kun's voice?

91
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:12,719
Yes. I asked the kidnapper
to put him on the phone.

92
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,639
How did Keita-kun seem?

93
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,789
He sounded unexpectedly cheerful;
he didn't seem afraid at all.

94
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:26,499
That is odd. You would expect
him to at least miss his mother.

95
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,919
He doesn't have one.

96
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,259
She died of a disease last year.

97
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:38,389
Perhaps that's why Keita grew
fond of his kindergarten teacher

98
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,059
and the women in the
neighborhood.

99
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,759
I see. Now I get it.

100
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,559
The kidnapper is likely working
with a woman good with children,

101
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,399
and she's taking care of Keita-kun.

102
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,969
The old man might be right.

103
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:03,329
Meaning we can't rest easy,
but it's unlikely they'll hurt Keita-kun.

104
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:09,549
Endo-san. I think you probably
should call the police now...

105
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,339
I can't do that!

106
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,429
Maybe the kidnappers will be
caught if the police intervene!

107
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,309
But what guarantee do I have
Keita will return unharmed?!

108
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,309
Yes, but...

109
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,329
Mori-san!

110
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,019
Yes?

111
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,059
You are my only hope now!

112
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,029
Please! Help bring
Keita back unharmed!

113
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,319
I beg you!

114
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,349
Very well! I was
the one who came to you!

115
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:43,039
Let's work together
to somehow solve this!

116
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,209
Thank you!

117
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,889
But we can't stay here too long.

118
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:57,009
We'll leave for tonight and
talk on the phone from now on.

119
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:57,969
Right!

120
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,679
I'll need to borrow this photo.

121
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,019
Yes, go right ahead.

122
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:13,559
You have nothing to worry about.
I will return Keita-kun safely!

123
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,069
Right! I appreciate your help!

124
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,759
I attached the transmitter.

125
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,479
Now we just wait for
the kidnappers to call!

126
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,369
Mori Detective Agency...

127
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,849
They called?!

128
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:35,469
What did they say?!

129
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:42,969
They demanded 20 million more,
and gave me two hours to get it!

130
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,519
Two hours?

131
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,979
Did you hear Keita-kun's voice?

132
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:51,309
Yes. I had them put him
on just like you said.

133
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,589
Then he said something odd...

134
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:54,899
Something odd?

135
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,449
Keita! Is that you?!

136
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,859
Daddy!

137
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,389
Keita! Are you okay?!

138
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,969
Yeah! There's lots
of crabs here, Daddy!

139
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:04,659
Crabs?

140
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,559
What're you talking about?

141
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,759
Listen! Call the cops and--

142
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,509
A whale! A whale is spouting bubbles!

143
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:15,719
Loudmouthed brat!
I'll contact you again!

144
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,589
Keita!

145
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,969
Hello?! Hello?!

146
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:24,059
Loudmouthed? The kidnapper said that?

147
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,019
Yes.

148
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:29,559
Understood. You get the money ready.

149
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,729
With any luck, I'll have
Keita-kun back within two hours!

150
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:37,939
Really?! Please do your best!

151
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,279
Dad! You have a clue
about the kidnappers?!

152
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:46,999
Yeah! Keita-kun is by lots of
crabs and a bubble-spouting whale!

153
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,019
Crabs and a whale?

154
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,789
Don't tell me it's the ocean...

155
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:59,469
Don't be dumb! Whales only
spout air deep underwater!

156
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,509
It wasn't a real whale that Keita-kun saw.
It was probably a model.

157
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:04,819
A model?

158
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,679
And that would be at the aquarium!

159
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,639
Southern Aquarium

160
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:15,469
You don't have any whale models?

161
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:20,569
No. We do have various kinds
of crabs, but no whale models...

162
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,219
Damn! Must be a different aquarium!

163
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,879
We have no time! Let's go!

164
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:35,719
Say... Are you sure the
crabs have to be real?

165
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,419
What?

166
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,059
When Keita-kun said there
were lots of crabs,

167
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,559
the kidnapper said,
"What are you talking about?"

168
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,509
Doesn't that mean the
kidnapper couldn't see any?

169
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:50,969
That is true...

170
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:56,309
So they didn't call
from the aquarium?

171
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,939
Look at that, Dad! It's a whale!

172
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:04,909
Nichiuri TV

173
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:09,889
Oh, yeah! Nichiuri TV's
mascot is a whale this year!

174
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,829
Could that be what Keita-kun saw?!

175
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:18,549
If so, then he was
where that blimp was visible...

176
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:32,429
Got it! The blimp was above
Beika Park when the kidnappers called!

177
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,429
Beika Park?

178
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,519
Yesterday's deal was
at a hotel on Beika Street!

179
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,489
Let's go back and look
for a place with lots of crabs!

180
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,949
Keita-kun has to be
somewhere near there!

181
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,059
Any luck?!

182
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:29,839
Nope.

183
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,489
Me neither.

184
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:35,789
Damn! Our time's up!
The kidnappers might've called.

185
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,249
Understood!

186
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,889
They called two minutes ago.

187
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:46,889
They told him to stand at the
end of Platform 1 in Karajuku Station.

188
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,059
Karajuku Station?

189
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,059
Yeah. You keep looking
for the crabs, Conan.

190
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,589
Got that?

191
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:53,469
Yeah!

192
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,179
Even if they did lose to the kidnappers,
my transmitter's on the case!

193
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,269
I will find them!

194
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,733
Karajuku Station

195
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,353
Do you think they'll be on a train?

196
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:23,963
I doubt it.

197
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:27,123
They'll probably exchange
the money elsewhere.

198
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,053
Hey!

199
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,093
Throw the money here!

200
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:41,053
Don't you care about the kid?!

201
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,243
Darn it! Ran!

202
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,273
Right!

203
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:01,873
He got away?!

204
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:06,503
Yes. But Mori-san got the
license plate number on film.

205
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,203
We'll know his identity soon!

206
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:08,913
Got it!

207
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:19,053
It's staying in the same spot.
Their hideout should be nearby!

208
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:28,483
Almost there!
Just around that corner!

209
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:39,113
Darn it! They must've
changed briefcases here!

210
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:44,163
But the old man got the license
plate number, so we can still--

211
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:50,793
Was this the kidnapper's?!
Was that license plate a fake?!

212
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:55,753
Oh no! Now that they have the money,
they might kill Keita-kun!

213
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:57,553
Darn it!

214
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:58,423
Find it!

215
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:02,213
Find where there's lots of crabs
and where the whale blimp was visible!

216
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:06,683
Didn't he say the whale
was spouting air bubbles?

217
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,643
That blimp wasn't spouting anything!

218
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:15,713
What does it mean? Was it not
the blimp he saw?! Or maybe--

219
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,373
Could it be?!

220
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,753
Can't see it from here.

221
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:43,883
That's it!

222
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:48,093
It might be visible from
that Starlight Hotel!

223
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:11,333
Beika Park. And then that.

224
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:14,803
Keita-kun saw the smoke
from that waste incineration facility...

225
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:28,673
It would look like that only
where the park and the tower line up...

226
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:32,563
That's right around here!

227
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:37,633
But this is too low. It needs to
be the same altitude as the blimp

228
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,373
to make it look like
it's spouting air.

229
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,823
Could they be in this hotel?!

230
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,733
That was close!

231
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,213
The tables and chairs...

232
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:58,003
Could the crabs actually be--

233
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,693
There they are! The crabs!

234
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:27,373
The tables and chairs look
like crabs from above!

235
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,743
No doubt about it! Keita-kun
is in some room in this hotel!

236
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,223
Lady!

237
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,263
Do you know which room
this boy is staying in?

238
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:54,213
Oh, he's in a room one floor down.
But he just left with his parents.

239
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:55,183
Thank you!

240
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:59,143
Alright! I found you!
Keita-kun is still unharmed!

241
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:06,073
Yaiba Punch!

242
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:09,203
Let's go, Joker! Hiyaaah!

243
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:13,133
Hey, are we really
going to kill him?

244
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:16,123
Quit asking and stop
worrying about him!

245
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:17,403
Let's go!

246
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:24,673
Keita-kun!

247
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:30,723
Those two are kidnappers!
Stop them!

248
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,343
Damn! Nobody move!

249
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,103
Move and he's dead!

250
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:38,713
Get over there! Now!

251
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:42,563
Is there anything to kick?!

252
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:49,573
The bike's right out front!
Run like hell once we're out the door!

253
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,953
Ready?

254
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,483
Take this!

255
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,023
And that's that!

256
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:52,133
Keita! I'm so glad
you're all right! Keita!

257
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,753
Daddy, that hurts!

258
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,783
How did you know they were here?

259
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:01,343
It was just dumb luck!

260
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,963
I was looking for the crabs
when I found Keita-kun!

261
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:10,003
When I shouted that it was a kidnapping,
they rushed to get away

262
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,383
and wound up like that.

263
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:14,213
Brought it upon themselves, huh?

264
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:15,423
Mori-kun!

265
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,683
Oh, Inspector Megure-dono!

266
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,383
Conan-kun explained everything.

267
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:25,853
Why didn't you contact us when
you learned it was a kidnapping?

268
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:29,333
Can't trust me, huh?

269
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:33,323
It's not that at all!

270
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:39,383
For the next hour, Inspector Megure
gave the old man a good scolding.

271
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,343
Not that that's a bad thing!

272
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:46,683
What was that?

273
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,023
This is a homicide!

274
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:55,403
It wouldn't be possible
to leave from here.

275
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:59,003
Why is there a bloodstain here?

276
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:04,753
Ikuta-san was standing here in the dark.

277
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:07,353
Could it be?!

278
00:24:08,353 --> 00:24:09,773
On the next Conan--

279
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,273
The Pitch Dark Road Murder Case.

280
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,928
Next Conan's Hint:

281
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:18,368
Tobacco.
