1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,340
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,640
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,540
Twice around a unique house in a day.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,840
An unexpected solution to an unexpected trick.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:02,253
"West Izu"

9
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:11,153
Well, the Inspector insisted that I ride this,

10
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,953
so I borrowed it from him.

11
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:16,553
But, boy was I lucky. For real.

12
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,653
I figured something like this happened, pops.

13
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:21,953
So...

14
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:25,153
I implore you, Inspector Megure!

15
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:27,753
Will you please?

16
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,453
I guess not, after all.

17
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:37,753
Inspector Megure?

18
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:41,053
Thank you so very much, Inspector Megure!

19
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:46,053
I'm pretty sure you forced your way through

20
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:47,753
borrowing this car.

21
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:51,553
And you call this lucky?

22
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:53,953
It's raining cats and dogs.

23
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:58,453
I can't even get a view of Mt. Fuji.

24
00:02:58,453 --> 00:02:59,853
Talk about unlucky.

25
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,753
Do you think so?

26
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:05,753
By the way, how much longer do we have to go, dad?

27
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,553
It's about time we get there, but...

28
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:11,353
Oh, isn't that it?

29
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:20,253
"The Gunshot at Sunflower Manor"

30
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,053
It took quite a while to get here

31
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:26,153
after the building came into view, right?

32
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:29,053
It did. The rain stopped too.

33
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,453
Mr. Mouri.

34
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,053
Yes!

35
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,353
"Ryuichiro Kanazawa (32)" -We've been waiting for you.

36
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:37,953
I'm very familiar with all your great deductions

37
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,953
through the articles in the papers.

38
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,953
I've read about you in the papers too,

39
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:46,053
famous architect, Mr. Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

40
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,753
I hear you've received another award just recently too.

41
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,853
What was it called?

42
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,153
The International Competition

43
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:54,853
at the Shanghai Modern Art Museum.

44
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:58,353
Mr. Kanazawa, are they your guests?

45
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,253
They are Hayashida and Amamori.

46
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,053
"Makoto Hayashida (26)" -I'm Makoto Hayashida.

47
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:05,453
"Masaya Amamori (25)" -I'm Masaya Amamori.

48
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,153
Keep your cool now,

49
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,553
this person here is none other than Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

50
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,453
-Mr. Kogoro Mouri? -That...

51
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:17,153
I am the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri.

52
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,553
I wish you'd stop

53
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:21,753
addressing yourself as a renowned detective.

54
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:22,753
What?

55
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,253
A stalker?

56
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,553
Yes, pictures like these have been sent to me

57
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:29,853
since three months ago.

58
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,553
You're in every picture.

59
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,653
Firstly, we have to find out who is doing this.

60
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,553
Do you have any ideas?

61
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,453
Not at all.

62
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,753
Please think carefully.

63
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,753
What I presume from years of my experience is that

64
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:53,153
the stalker is very likely someone you know.

65
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:54,353
What?

66
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:55,953
For example...

67
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:58,153
"7 pm"

68
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:01,453
Is the award ceremony the day after tomorrow?

69
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:03,953
It's going to be at a hotel in Shanghai.

70
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:06,853
Shanghai? Are you all going too?

71
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,353
No, we're going to stay behind and watch the house.

72
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,053
Right, Amamori?

73
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,553
Yeah, I guess.

74
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:17,253
By the way, Ran, what do you think of this building?

75
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:19,953
It sure is a different looking building.

76
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,753
You think so too, don't you?

77
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,953
Mr. Kanazawa designed this building personally too,

78
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:25,753
but it's a good taste, don't you think?

79
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:30,053
I had a feeling the building moved just now?

80
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:32,753
It's really moving.

81
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,953
The second floor moves once around every 12 hours.

82
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:39,253
We call it the Sunflower Manor.

83
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,353
How interesting.

84
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:44,353
But, why was it made to rotate?

85
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:46,953
Beats me. I wonder why.

86
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:49,153
I guess I'll ask Mr. Kanazawa one of these days.

87
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:52,053
There's no reason.

88
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,153
"Mitsuko Kanazawa (38)" -His architecture is nothing more than

89
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,153
crowd pleasing bluff!

90
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,753
"7:10 pm"

91
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:01,253
By the time you return,

92
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:03,853
I'm sure everything will be solved.

93
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,453
I sure hope so.

94
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,553
Mr. Mouri, was it?

95
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:09,453
Oh. Yes!

96
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,753
Mr. Mouri!

97
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,953
Could I also ask you a favor?

98
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,753
Yes.

99
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:16,953
Would you...

100
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:20,653
Would you please investigate his background?

101
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:22,853
If the remuneration is greatly split,

102
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:26,153
I may have half the compensation.

103
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,553
Mitsuko, that's enough!

104
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:29,653
Wasted and boozed out like that,

105
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:31,753
can you get on the plane tomorrow or what!

106
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:35,253
Why don't you go to the awards ceremony alone?

107
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:38,353
Or, do you intend to go with the stalker?

108
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,253
Now, that's enough!

109
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:43,453
You're the one that's already done enough.

110
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:46,053
You seem to be concerned over a stalker or what not,

111
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,853
but aren't you the one who brought it upon yourself?

112
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:51,153
Like your ex-girlfriends and such.

113
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,253
Hayashida!

114
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,653
Yes, sir?

115
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:56,953
All you've been eating so far is meat.

116
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,153
Yes. But this meat...

117
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,853
Meat... With those unbalanced eating habit,

118
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,053
you can never come up with designs

119
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:07,253
with a taste of originality to them.

120
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,953
"7:20 pm" -It's all because of your unbalanced diet.

121
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:10,453
Just where do you think you're going?

122
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:14,453
I'm just going to get some beer from the refrigerator!

123
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:18,153
Why don't you stop picking on people weaker than you?

124
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:19,153
If you keep it up,

125
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:21,753
you'll be bitten by your supposedly faithful dog one day.

126
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,553
Right, Mr. Amamori?

127
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:32,653
"7:25pm" -I'll go get some charcoal.

128
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:33,853
Will you watch the meat

129
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,953
so that it won't get over cooked?

130
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,553
What? Okay.

131
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:43,153
Mr. Mouri! This dressing goes well with that salad.

132
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:47,353
But it says olive oil on it.

133
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,953
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,653
I used what bottle I had available,

135
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,053
but the dressing is what I just made a while ago.

136
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,953
It's my own original dressing.

137
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:57,453
You don't have to use any of the dressing.

138
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:59,953
Besides, her taste buds are not what you can call normal.

139
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:02,853
My. That's just what you think.

140
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:05,553
Mr. Kanazawa!

141
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,453
It's 7:29 pm. 1 minute left.

142
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:09,853
Oh, that's right.

143
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:12,153
Then, will you take care of things for me here?

144
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:21,353
Mr. Amamori, where is Mr. Kanazawa going?

145
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:24,153
To watch the Chinese Language Course on TV.

146
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:27,153
He's all excited about giving his speech in Chinese

147
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,753
at the awards ceremony.

148
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:31,053
No matter how busy he is recently,

149
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,253
he checks the program out real time.

150
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,653
It's just a snobbish hobby.

151
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:44,553
"7:35 pm"

152
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,353
Now...

153
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,053
Where's my beer?

154
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,253
Have a cold one.

155
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:58,753
Thank you.

156
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:00,253
Come on, dad!

157
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,353
Haven't you already had enough?

158
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:06,053
Don't be silly! I just started drinking!

159
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,153
What was that?

160
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:22,753
Mr. Kanazawa!

161
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,353
The doors locked from the inside!

162
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,953
Is there a spare key?

163
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,153
Most likely not.

164
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:34,553
I guess we have no choice but to break the door down, then.

165
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,953
I'll go get an axe!

166
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,553
"7:40 pm"

167
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,153
Mr. Kanazawa?

168
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,853
Mr. Kanazawa!

169
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,553
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Kanazawa?

170
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:50,953
Is something wrong?

171
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,453
Ran, turn on the lights!

172
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:54,653
All right!

173
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:55,753
Mr. Kanazawa?

174
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,153
Mr. Kanazawa!

175
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:19,761
The victim is architect, Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

176
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,661
It seems that Mr. Kanazawa

177
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,861
always sits here whenever he watches TV.

178
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:27,161
"Officer Yokomizo" -He died on the spot

179
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,461
after being shot in the head.

180
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,461
And the murder weapon seems to be nowhere in this room.

181
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:35,161
The windows are all locked from the inside.

182
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,961
So it's a locked room murder case!

183
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:40,161
No.

184
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:43,261
There is a mark of a bullet having pierced through the window here.

185
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:47,361
Which means the sniper shot the gun from...

186
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:49,661
Shot the gun from?

187
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:51,961
Shot the gun from...

188
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,261
I wonder where?

189
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,961
Mr. Mouri!

190
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:58,561
This is no time to be joking!

191
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,661
Excuse me! This room is really something, you know?

192
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,461
I was told that it rotates once around every 12 hours!

193
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:06,161
Rotates?

194
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:09,861
I see! It's 8:35 pm now,

195
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,661
so the gunshot was heard an hour ago.

196
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:16,261
If we move back the line that ties the position of the victim

197
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,561
and the hole on the window an hour, in other words,

198
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:20,561
move back at an angle of 30 degrees.

199
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,561
That's it!

200
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:32,361
I wonder what that is?

201
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:35,861
That thing that is on the decoration of that building.

202
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,761
Could it be oil?

203
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,561
There are none, after all.

204
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,061
What's up?

205
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:46,461
Well, there are no footprints around the pine

206
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:48,761
where the rifle was fixed on.

207
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,561
There were quite a few

208
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,261
between the shed and the party hall, though.

209
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,961
Between 6:00 to 6:30 this evening,

210
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:58,661
it was raining cats and dogs in this area.

211
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:02,561
Which means that nobody went near the tree

212
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,561
where the gun was fixed after 6:30!

213
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:07,861
If so, just how did the sniper fire?

214
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,661
At any rate, go find the owner of the rifle on the double!

215
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:16,261
Yes, sir!

216
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:17,361
Mr. Mouri!

217
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,161
The rifle is wet.

218
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:21,361
So, it must've been placed there

219
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,861
before the sudden shower, after all.

220
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,661
It's right on target.

221
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,761
This is undoubtedly the weapon.

222
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,161
The problem is after the gun was fired,

223
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:33,261
where did the sniper go?

224
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:36,261
Don't tell me the sniper took a dive into the sea.

225
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,461
But, the beach is right below,

226
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,561
so it'd be impossible to jump right into the sea.

227
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,561
Mr. Mouri!

228
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,161
This is a fishing line!

229
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:49,361
-The end of the fishing line... -The end of the fishing line...

230
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:52,761
What's with this line?

231
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,661
It's covered with mud.

232
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:57,161
There's mud on the trigger too!

233
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,461
What?

234
00:12:58,461 --> 00:12:59,661
A weight?

235
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,661
I see! I got it.

236
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,061
What?

237
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:05,161
The fact is this...

238
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,261
This sniper knew that the victim

239
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,961
would be watching TV in the study,

240
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:12,461
calculated the time when the bullet would strike its target,

241
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:13,661
and then at the time of the crime,

242
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:17,261
pulled the weight at the tip of the fish line from here.

243
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,761
Then the sniper would not have to go into the villa,

244
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,561
and fleeing would not be difficult.

245
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:24,461
Then, you think that the sniper is someone from outside?

246
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:28,861
But, if the sniper knew what the victim was going to do.

247
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,161
Officer Yokomizo.

248
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:36,061
The victim was being hassled by a heinous stalker lately.

249
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:39,461
Which means that the stalker is the sniper?

250
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,561
I guess it would be most reasonable to come to that conclusion.

251
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:45,161
It's true that unlike the usual Pops,

252
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,961
his deductions have been correct so far.

253
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,961
It was impossible for people at the party to shoot

254
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,561
when the shot was heard.

255
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,761
But, why is this so intricately designed?

256
00:13:58,161 --> 00:13:59,661
Hold on. That is why

257
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:03,461
there was mud on both the fishing line and the rifle.

258
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:06,261
The sudden shower would've washed the mud clean.

259
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:09,161
What on earth is going on?

260
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,661
Was it rigged to hide something else?

261
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:15,061
If so, what could it be?

262
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,461
Officer Yokomizo!

263
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:19,761
The rifle seems to be the victim's personal belongings.

264
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:23,161
He had filed a robbery report for the rifle last week.

265
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,161
I see.

266
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,361
And the substance that was on the decoration

267
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:28,961
of the second floor outer wall

268
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:30,761
was oil after all.

269
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,161
Oil?

270
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:37,261
Okay. I would like you all to tell me

271
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:40,161
what you were doing today!

272
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,461
At 6:40 pm,

273
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:47,361
Right after arriving here, Mr. Mouri immediately went up

274
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:49,161
to the second floor together with Mr. Kanazawa.

275
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:52,961
Conan, Ran, Mr. Hayashida and Mr. Amamori

276
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:55,861
were all in the backyard, right?

277
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,261
And, Mrs. Kanazawa, you were...

278
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:00,961
I was drinking brandy in the kitchen.

279
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:03,661
I went outside after 7:00 pm.

280
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:07,161
The party began at 7:10 pm

281
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,861
and Mr. Mouri and Mr. Kanazawa join in.

282
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,461
At 7:20 pm, Mr. Hayashida,

283
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:15,561
you went to the kitchen to get some beer.

284
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:18,161
You were gone for about five minutes.

285
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:19,161
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,461
Mr. Amamori, you left to go get some charcoal

287
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,661
just as Mr. Hayashida was coming back from the kitchen.

288
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:27,561
He was gone for four minutes.

289
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,261
At 7:29 pm,

290
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,561
Mr. Kanazawa goes upstairs alone

291
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,361
in order to watch TV.

292
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:38,061
After that, I left to go to the bathroom at 7:30 pm

293
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,961
and was gone for about five minutes.

294
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:42,361
I heard the gunshot as soon as I got back.

295
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,661
Let me verify things once more.

296
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,261
At the time the gunshot was heard,

297
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:49,961
everyone that was at the party was here?

298
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:53,861
Yeah, that is why none of us here

299
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:55,661
could've shot the gun.

300
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,561
I've more or less figured out the trick.

301
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:06,661
But, the problem is who did it.

302
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,961
This is...

303
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:11,161
Hey, officer. There's something on the ground.

304
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,761
Thank you!

305
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:17,161
Mr. Mouri says he wants you to check on something.

306
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:22,561
The diameter of the building is 20m,

307
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:24,061
the distance from the building to the tree

308
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,861
where the rifle was set up is 10m.

309
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:29,961
And the length of the fishing line that is left on the rifle

310
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,061
is precisely 10m and 2cm.

311
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,361
Thank you!

312
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,461
I've figured it out!

313
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,561
That person is the sniper!

314
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:41,361
Conan!

315
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:44,161
That kid, where is he hiding anyway?

316
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,461
Hey. Dad!

317
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,961
This is no time to rest. Help me look for Conan!

318
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,461
I've found him!

319
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:57,561
What?

320
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,661
I'm over here

321
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:02,961
Conan!

322
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:06,961
And I've also figured out who did it.

323
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,961
Ran, will you please gather everyone here?

324
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,861
Mr. Mouri! You've figured out who did it?

325
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,161
I thought you said just now that the sniper was someone from outside.

326
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,961
Please forget what I said back then.

327
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:21,861
But, its true that the trigger could be pulled

328
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:24,561
if the fishing line is pulled from below the cliff.

329
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,861
Because the sniper probably wanted to confuse everyone

330
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:30,061
by making it look like someone from the outside committed the crime.

331
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,661
But, the sniper didn't realize that

332
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:37,761
mud would adhere to the trigger.

333
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:42,961
If it rained, the mud was supposed to wash off clean.

334
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:47,361
In other words, the rifle was fired in another way.

335
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:50,361
And the one who was capable of carrying it out.

336
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,561
In other words, the sniper is here.

337
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,161
What?

338
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:58,561
I shall show you right now how the rifle was fired

339
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,561
without anyone attending to it.

340
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,761
May I ask you to help me, Officer Yokomizo?

341
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:07,061
Yes, sir.

342
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:09,661
Please roll the paper up tight.

343
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:13,161
Then connect the cylinders with double-stick tape

344
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:15,261
and make a rod.

345
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,461
Then stick the double-stick tape on the tip of the rod.

346
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:21,661
What is this double-stick for?

347
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,961
That reminds me, I found this on the ground!

348
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:27,961
It's the same!

349
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,861
You mean this is the sniper's?

350
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:30,961
When everything is ready,

351
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,861
will you please look at the ground?

352
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,861
This was found by the trigger.

353
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,161
Please hook that onto the tip of the rod.

354
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,861
Then lift the rod towards the building.

355
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:47,761
Lift up the fishing line that is attached to the pine tree.

356
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,361
And when the line is pulled taut,

357
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,561
the weight that is attached to the other end of the line.

358
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,561
I see, that's why there was mud on the fishing line.

359
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,761
Now, please look at the top of the building.

360
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,361
Do you see something?

361
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:00,861
The top?

362
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:01,961
Did you say the top?

363
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,361
The decoration on the second floor?

364
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:09,461
Yes. The sniper hooked the fishing line on it.

365
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,461
The weight is gradually pulled up.

366
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,761
And eventually puts pressure on the trigger.

367
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,461
Of course, the sniper was extremely careful

368
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,061
and applied oil to the decoration

369
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:25,361
so that the fishing line would slide smoothly.

370
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:27,961
The sniper probably placed tissue paper

371
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,561
or something that was soaked in oil

372
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,861
at the tip of the newspaper.

373
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:32,061
The oil was most likely applied

374
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,861
just before the fishing line was hooked up.

375
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:40,161
It probably took at most one to two minutes.

376
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:43,061
And, Mr. Mouri! Just who is it?

377
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:44,361
The sniper.

378
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,361
The sniper is...

379
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,761
You, Mr. Amamori!

380
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:54,761
At 7:25 pm,

381
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:55,961
you went out to the backyard saying that

382
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,361
you were going to get some charcoal.

383
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:10,661
You pulled up the fishing line that you had hidden

384
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:13,061
under the soil beforehand,

385
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:15,061
and got it ready.

386
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,961
Then, you came back to the party site

387
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:19,161
as if nothing had happened.

388
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:21,061
With the rod made of newspaper taken apart

389
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,961
and you used it to wrapped the charcoal in it.

390
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,161
Because of the length of the fishing line,

391
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,961
the time the fishing line could be hooked

392
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,261
onto the building was only 10 minutes.

393
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:33,961
In other words, we heard the gunshot at 7:35pm.

394
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:36,061
Which means the culprit left the party

395
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:38,661
during the 10 minutes time frame from 7:25pm.

396
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:43,261
And you're the only one I can think of.

397
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:47,261
All of you do not know the real...

398
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,461
the real Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

399
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:53,661
I'm the one who designed

400
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:55,161
the Shanghai Modern Museum!

401
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,661
I stole your design?

402
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:03,561
Don't be ridiculous. Do you have proof?

403
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,361
I've always respected you, Mr. Kanazawa!

404
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,461
I'll just warn you about one thing.

405
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,461
You don't seem to be aware of where you stand.

406
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:17,861
That design gained public attention

407
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,461
because it was announced under my name.

408
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:24,361
If you want to stay here, watch your mouth.

409
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:30,361
At that time, I swore to myself that...

410
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:34,761
I would never let him go to the awards ceremony.

411
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:40,961
Then, were you the one that was stalking him?

412
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:45,261
Yes. I made up an imaginary stalker.

413
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:50,661
Everything went as planned. Mr. Mouri.

414
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:54,161
Other than the fact that you showed up today.

415
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,961
What's up, Ran?

416
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:39,361
After this case,

417
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,361
I don't know if I can trust

418
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:42,761
those who people call geniuses anymore.

419
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,561
Which means you can't trust me either?

420
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,761
-What? -What?

421
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,561
Imagine that the great Mouri Kogoro

422
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,661
is not the one solving all these cases.

423
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,961
What do you think of that idea?

424
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:04,061
You know yourself more than you realize!

425
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:08,361
"Next Episode" -What are you doing here?

426
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,561
Ran?

427
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,661
I see!

428
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,861
The beach that Dr. Agasa was talking about was here!

429
00:24:13,861 --> 00:24:15,061
Yep.

430
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,461
Hey, don't you think it's strange, Officer Yokomizo?

431
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,061
He drowned and yet his clothes

432
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,061
and body are full of scratches.

433
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:28,561
And besides, why is he wrapped in the net?

434
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,061
Next Conan,

435
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Mystery Caught In the Net (Part 1)"

436
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:37,879
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:39,979
"Scratched up cell phone"

438
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,479
The stage of the next episode is at the beach.

439
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,779
Conan, how do you like my swimsuit?

440
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:44,979
My nose is bleeding.
