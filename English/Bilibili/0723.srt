1
00:00:01,124 --> 00:00:04,724
In order to kill time until the cake arrives at Doc's house,

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:07,824
we decided to play soccer in the park.

3
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:09,524
Partway through the game, we chased Tai,

4
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:12,224
a cat that has its territory in the vicinity of coffee shop Poirot,

5
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,824
and end up being locked up in a refrigerated compartment

6
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,924
of a courier truck.

7
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,424
Furthermore, since Haibara's handmade sweater unravels

8
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:24,824
and she ends up being improperly dressed,

9
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,424
not being able to get off the truck, we were locked inside.

10
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,924
While we were doing this and that's,

11
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,224
we discover a man's corpse

12
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:33,424
in one of the cardboard boxes of the truck.

13
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:36,524
We tried to contact the police using Mitsuhiko's cell phone,

14
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:39,324
but it runs out of battery.

15
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:42,024
So then we tried to get in contact somehow with people outside

16
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:45,624
by using the things we had on hand.

17
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:49,124
I have a handkerchief, pocket tissue,

18
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:51,024
candy and a cotton swab.

19
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:55,524
-How about you, Genta? -I've got...

20
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,924
Band-aid, a chocolate bar,

21
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,424
and anti-itching ointment for frost bites.

22
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,624
And, what about you, Mitsuhiko?

23
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,824
I have...

24
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:07,124
A memo pad, a ball point pen to go with it,

25
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:10,824
a handkerchief, a wallet, and a taxi receipt.

26
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:15,724
If I remember correctly, this cat...

27
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:19,824
I get it! There's a way...

28
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:22,124
What? If you came up with something,

29
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,724
tell us about it.

30
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:26,324
Huh?

31
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:29,524
The stop that this delivery truck made just before now

32
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,524
was at Beika Condo in the third district.

33
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,624
The two houses that they stopped at now was in the fourth district.

34
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,024
So, the next stop would be?

35
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:38,824
The fifth district?

36
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,424
Right.

37
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:43,524
The territory of this cat, Tai.

38
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,224
The fifth district is where he goes to beg for food

39
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,524
at coffee shop Poirot.

40
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:51,124
I see! You're going to make Tai go

41
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,224
and deliver a note that asks help for us!

42
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:55,024
If we stick it in between its collar,

43
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:57,624
I'm sure Azusa will notice it!

44
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,424
Let's do it!

45
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:00,724
Yeah.

46
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:02,424
But...

47
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:06,324
But, if those two men catch Tai

48
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,324
and see the paper attached to its collar...

49
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:10,724
I've already figured that part out too.

50
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,524
Huh?

51
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,724
I'll think up a code that they won't figure out

52
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:17,124
even if they were to see it.

53
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,124
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

54
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:34,124
are slashed by the light of deduction.

55
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:35,624
The code that divides the fate of the Detective Squad.

56
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,824
Where will the code memo be delivered to?

57
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

58
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

59
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:44,324
His name is Detective Conan!

60
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:21,937
"A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 2)"

61
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,937
A code?

62
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:28,137
Listen.

63
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:32,037
The taxi receipt that Mitsuhiko had is thermal paper.

64
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,437
Words are written not by ink

65
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:36,837
but by changing the color of the words to black using heat.

66
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,637
On the surface of the thermal paper,

67
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:41,037
there is a chemical that becomes the base of the color black

68
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:44,237
and an acidic chemical called color former.

69
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,137
This color former melts with the heat

70
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,337
and reacts to the other chemical

71
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:51,637
making the color black emerge.

72
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:56,137
The ammonia that is in the anti-itching ointment that Genta had

73
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:59,137
is alkaline and neutralizes acid.

74
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:01,037
Putting this on this cotton swab,

75
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:02,937
and tracing the top part of the letter A

76
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:06,637
in the word Card that is written on the receipt...

77
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:11,537
The letter A changed to the letter O!

78
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,637
Really!

79
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:14,537
You're a genius, Conan!

80
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:15,937
Next...

81
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:20,337
From this word Card Purchases,

82
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,037
erase a part of the letter A,

83
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,537
and the letter D in the word Card,

84
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:24,737
then from the word Purchases,

85
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:28,137
erase the letters U, R, C, H, A

86
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,837
and the last letter S...

87
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,437
This results in the word Corpse

88
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:34,237
which means dead body.

89
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,037
And by strategically erasing part

90
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,337
the card number and phone number that are displayed below,

91
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:44,337
we can inform people that a corpse is inside

92
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:47,937
and the license plate number of this refrigerated vehicle.

93
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,937
Conan, you're terrific!

94
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:52,637
Then we fold this

95
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,137
and stick it between Tai's collar.

96
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,437
This way, even if Tai is caught by the men

97
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,737
and they notice this receipt,

98
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,737
they'll probably think it's a misprint,

99
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,937
or that it scraped against something

100
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:05,737
and the letters rubbed off.

101
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:06,837
I see.

102
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,937
This is perfect.

103
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:10,737
Just as expected of you.

104
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:14,937
Rats! The car's going to stop!

105
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:16,337
Listen Tai.

106
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:19,137
Whether we make it or not depends on you.

107
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:21,737
Make sure you succeed this mission, okay?

108
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:31,237
A cat...

109
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,537
A cat's in the refrigerated compartment?

110
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:37,537
It probably snuck in when you left the door open.

111
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:43,837
So, the cry that I heard a while ago was this cat's.

112
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,037
Huh? There's a piece of paper by its collar.

113
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:50,137
Huh? A receipt?

114
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:52,337
-What? -Oh no.

115
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:55,437
Hey...

116
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:59,437
Heck! It got away.

117
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:01,437
Never mind the cat.

118
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:02,837
Yeah.

119
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,837
Let's leave the rest up to Tai.

120
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,837
Right...

121
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:13,937
Hey...

122
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:16,537
If that cat's going to Poirot,

123
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,937
that code's going to be seen by him too?

124
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:21,037
Yeah, to put it more accurately,

125
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:23,837
I made that code to show it to him!

126
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,237
I'm sure that he'll get the message right away,

127
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,237
because he's Bourbon,

128
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:31,737
a member of the organization of the men in black.

129
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:35,237
"Poirot Coffee"

130
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,237
Oh, Tai. You're late today.

131
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,337
Enjoy to your heart's content.

132
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,737
What's this?

133
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,737
There's something attached to the collar.

134
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:56,637
A taxi receipt?

135
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,337
Azusa.

136
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:00,437
The shop master's calling you.

137
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,937
Thank you.

138
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:05,237
That's right, you're a detective aren't you, Amuro?

139
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:07,237
Huh? Yes, I guess.

140
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,837
Then, would you have any idea what this is?

141
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:15,937
What was that?

142
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:19,037
Oh, well, it was nothing really.

143
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,837
Is that so?

144
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:31,937
It's cold.

145
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:34,737
That's the last for the seventh district of Beikacho.

146
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:37,837
Make sure they remember your face and name, now.

147
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,837
Okay.

148
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,437
We're just about to return to the second district

149
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,337
to deliver a time-specified box.

150
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:48,337
We can return the corpse to its home in the first district.

151
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:54,737
Hey, Conan.

152
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:57,737
It's been a while since the cat left,

153
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,037
but nobody's coming to rescue us.

154
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,137
Maybe that code was too difficult after all?

155
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:08,037
Or, maybe the paper with the code on it came off partway.

156
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,937
So, what are we going to do?

157
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:13,237
The boxes to be delivered are decreasing

158
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:15,637
and we'll have no place to hide anymore.

159
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:18,137
-Huh? -True!

160
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:26,137
Hey, can't you do something about that twosome

161
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:29,337
using your tranquilizer gun or your Super Kick shoe?

162
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,537
I thought about that, first thing

163
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,637
but the battery's nearly dead

164
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,737
and the voltage has gone down because of this cold,

165
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:38,437
so it won't budge an inch.

166
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,337
Mitsuhiko, are you okay?

167
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:45,237
You've been quiet for a while, but are you okay?

168
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,537
Yes.

169
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:50,537
It seems I've somehow managed to overcome the cold.

170
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,137
I've stopped shivering too.

171
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:56,637
Hey! That's bad!

172
00:09:58,037 --> 00:10:02,037
Mitsuhiko...

173
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,337
He's experiencing disorientation of the brain

174
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,137
due to hypothermia.

175
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:09,037
Moreover, his fingertips are turning purple

176
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:10,937
and he's on the verge of getting frostbite.

177
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:12,137
No joke!

178
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:15,437
Mitsuhiko lent his jacket to Haibara

179
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:17,637
and was only wearing a t-shirt.

180
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:19,137
Mitsuhiko!

181
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:20,737
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

182
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,337
Get a hold of yourself!

183
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:25,537
Mitsuhiko...

184
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:38,037
Huh? The words on the taxi receipt were erased?

185
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,637
Is that what you were about to show me a while ago?

186
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:42,837
Yes.

187
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:47,937
If I remember correctly, the letters between COR, P, SE were erased,

188
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:50,837
so I thought it was a misprint.

189
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:55,037
Corpse...

190
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,337
Dead body.

191
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:00,637
Who knows that the cat comes here ever day

192
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:02,237
to beg for food?

193
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:04,737
Since it started coming around quite recently,

194
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:08,537
the ones who know are the shop master, you and I.

195
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:11,037
And, Conan...

196
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,037
Conan Edogawa knows too?

197
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:21,437
And, when I took the receipt, I touched the collar,

198
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:23,537
but it seemed to be pretty cold.

199
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,937
About the receipt,

200
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,637
if I remember correctly, it blew over that way, didn't it?

201
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:36,137
Yes? You mean you're going to look for it?

202
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:38,237
Please tell the shop master that I suddenly started feeling sick,

203
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,837
so left for home early.

204
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,937
And also that he doesn't have to pay me for today.

205
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,037
Oh, okay.

206
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:49,337
Judging from the velocity and direction of the wind

207
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:50,637
and making a simulation taking into consideration

208
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:53,537
the position of the buildings around here,

209
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:55,337
I could read the flow of the wind,

210
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:57,937
and can probably narrow down where it flew off to.

211
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,437
Mitsuhiko!

212
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:05,837
Please... Mitsuhiko, get up!

213
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,537
Mitsuhiko!

214
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:12,737
He got up!

215
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:15,037
I...

216
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:16,337
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:17,437
Huh?

218
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,837
That you're going through this just because of me.

219
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:24,237
Stay still. I'll warm you up right now.

220
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:27,337
Okay, thank you so very much.

221
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,637
But, with all of you in that state,

222
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,137
we could never run for it even if we wanted to.

223
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:36,237
Darn, we were supposed to be eating delicious cake by now

224
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:37,937
at Doc's house.

225
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:40,637
He said it was cake coming from a cake shop in Yokohama.

226
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,237
Yokohama?

227
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:44,037
Is the cake that's supposed to arrive at Doc's house

228
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:45,837
from a shop in Yokohama?

229
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,637
Yes, it seems he specified the time of delivery

230
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,837
to match the time we would be there.

231
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,837
But, today we were able to make it back early from school.

232
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,937
Those guys were saying a while ago

233
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:00,637
that they would be returning to the second district

234
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,037
to make a time-specified delivery.

235
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,537
Conan, if you touch it too much,

236
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,637
they'll find out!

237
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,337
I found it.

238
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:11,737
The cake that's supposed to be delivered to Doc's house.

239
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,737
Oh! Are we eating it now?

240
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:18,337
Idiot. We're going to put a message in it.

241
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:19,837
Huh?

242
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,637
By using the ball pen that Mitsuhiko had,

243
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,437
and Ayumi's cotton swab.

244
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:29,237
If you're planning to write something on the box,

245
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:31,637
I don't think you should, Conan.

246
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:34,137
If the two men find out...

247
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,537
Besides, it'll work only

248
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:38,837
if Doc sees the message right away.

249
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,637
Don't worry, he'll notice it right away.

250
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:45,437
We're not delivering it to Doc.

251
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:46,437
Huh?

252
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,437
Just as I thought. It was around here after all.

253
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,437
The number that is displayed at the bottom of the word Corpse

254
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:01,637
is most likely the license plate number.

255
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,037
If the cat's collar was cold,

256
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,437
the thing thinkable is a freezer vehicle,

257
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:09,137
but vehicles that are used for special purposes like this,

258
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:12,337
have license plate numbers that begin with the number eight.

259
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:15,437
But this isn't an eight number.

260
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,337
Which means, it's mostly likely a refrigerated courier truck.

261
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,137
With all this information so far...

262
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:27,337
Huh? Where's the Kudo residence?

263
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:29,737
Huh, Kudo?

264
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:31,137
What're you talking about?

265
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,437
The time-specified delivery

266
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,037
is for the Agasa residence, isn't it?

267
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:36,737
But, look! At this delivery slip.

268
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:37,737
Huh?

269
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:38,837
Before the name Agasa,

270
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,537
it says care of the Kudo residence.

271
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:45,937
Strange, it doesn't say so on this side.

272
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:48,437
Oh! This house seems to be it.

273
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:52,937
Yes.

274
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:56,537
Cheeta Courier.

275
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:59,937
Is there a Mr. Hiroshi Agasa there?

276
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:03,137
Mr. Agasa lives next door.

277
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,837
Well, I came to deliver a box

278
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,837
that says Mr. Hiroshi Agasa care of the Kudo residence.

279
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:14,237
I remember, it's cake, isn't it?

280
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,837
Since he's in the room next door

281
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:18,037
and his hands are tied right now,

282
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,637
I'll take it.

283
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,737
What? You wrote in care of the Kudo residence

284
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:27,337
before the name Dr. Agasa?

285
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,137
And with a ball point pen too?

286
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,537
Yeah. So, the box is supposed to be delivered not to Doc,

287
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:36,537
but to Subaru who is next door at the Kudo residence.

288
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:42,437
And? It's okay that he's going to receive the box,

289
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:45,837
but how did you relay to him this crisis we're facing?

290
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:48,537
Think about it.

291
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:50,237
I'm the only one in this world

292
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,437
who could write an address like that, right?

293
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:55,637
Besides if you take a good look at the font and its color,

294
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:59,137
Subaru would be able to tell right away

295
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:01,237
that the words have been added on at a later time with a ball point pen.

296
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,937
He'll also see through that something like

297
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,737
that can only be done

298
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:08,937
from inside the back compartment of a courier truck.

299
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,437
I see.

300
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,237
That's amazing.

301
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,637
Well, just in case, I wrote down the circumstances

302
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,037
on that delivery slip too.

303
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,637
Huh? But, doing something like that

304
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:22,137
would give us away right away!

305
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:23,537
Don't worry.

306
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:26,137
Because I wrote it after taking the cotton off this swab.

307
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:27,237
Huh?

308
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,837
You could never write with something like that!

309
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:32,437
That's what you think.

310
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:34,437
The delivery slip is made of several layers of paper

311
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:36,037
which includes a copy for the sender

312
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,537
and an item label.

313
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:40,337
If you write on the very top slip,

314
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:43,437
all the papers under it will be carbon copied.

315
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:49,037
So if I pull out the item received slip that the deliveryman would take out

316
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:52,637
after having it signed by the recipient

317
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,137
and write from on top of it,

318
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:58,737
then put the item received slip back together with the delivery slip

319
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:01,137
nobody will notice what I have written

320
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,437
on the now bottom-most slip, the recipient's copy,

321
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:06,937
until Subaru flips the item label over.

322
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:11,137
Then, are you saying that those two men

323
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,637
are being beaten up by Subaru now?

324
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:16,137
No, if I know Subaru...

325
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:22,037
Hey, why are opening the door again?

326
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,437
The one I delivered the box to a while ago

327
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:26,037
asked me to collect a box from him.

328
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:28,937
Well, since it's a small box, it's okay, right?

329
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:30,737
I guess so.

330
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:38,937
Hey...

331
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:40,137
Conan.

332
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:47,237
Just as I thought.

333
00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:49,037
A cell phone?

334
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,437
I see.

335
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,737
In this situation, that would be the best weapon.

336
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,037
Yeah.

337
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:58,537
In order to safely yet surely nab them,

338
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:02,537
it would be best to relay this information directly to the police myself.

339
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:06,037
No, you're not.

340
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,037
Since the position of the boxes were slightly moved from a while ago,

341
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:13,137
I decided to check,

342
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,837
and found all you petty thieves aside from that cat.

343
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:19,337
More so, there are five of you.

344
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:21,237
I... I told you that...

345
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:23,137
I heard voices of children.

346
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:24,837
Yeah, sorry.

347
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,437
But, what stupid kids,

348
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,037
all they had to do was call the police right away.

349
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:33,437
And just what are you going to do about these kids?

350
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,737
What else?

351
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,537
After we take their cell phone away,

352
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:41,237
we'll lock them up in here till they freeze to death.

353
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:44,737
If we line the bodies of the kids next to the man,

354
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:48,037
it's sure to be a cold case difficult to solve.

355
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:52,337
After all, we and the kids have no connection to each other at all.

356
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,337
I guess so.

357
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:04,537
Excuse me! Since this alley is small,

358
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:06,637
could you yield the way please?

359
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:08,937
I don't want to hurt you or the car, you see.

360
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:10,737
-Oh... -Right away.

361
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:12,437
Detective Amuro!

362
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:14,537
Help!

363
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:17,437
What're you guys doing

364
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:18,537
in a place like that?

365
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,137
No... well, this is you see...

366
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:24,137
You... do you know these brats?

367
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:26,637
Yes, I do.

368
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:29,637
Now that you've witnessed this, I've got no choice.

369
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:31,737
If you don't want me to kill the kids,

370
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,837
you get inside the refrigerated compartment too.

371
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,137
I told you, didn't I?

372
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,437
To yield the way

373
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:44,137
because I didn't want to hurt you.

374
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,437
Would you like me to take you on too?

375
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:53,637
No...

376
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,037
All right...

377
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:02,637
Okay, Conan, report this to the police.

378
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:03,937
Okay.

379
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:12,037
But, you're really something.

380
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:15,737
You saw the code on the receipt and came, right?

381
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:17,937
Huh? A receipt?

382
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:20,337
If you're talking about the queer receipt

383
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:21,937
that was on the cat's collar,

384
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,737
it was blown away by the wind

385
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,237
and I couldn't find it.

386
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:29,137
-Huh... -I just happened to pass by here.

387
00:20:29,137 --> 00:20:30,437
Is that all?

388
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,037
Then, would you like to have cake over

389
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:34,537
at Doc's house too, Mr. Detective?

390
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:39,437
So this is the rumored Dr. Agasa's place.

391
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,837
That...

392
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:45,437
But, I don't think so today.

393
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:48,337
I've got other things to attend to besides.

394
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:52,837
Please give my regards to Dr. Agasa, will you.

395
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,437
I see.

396
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:29,537
What a catastrophe it was.

397
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:31,637
I was so cold,

398
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:34,737
that I thought I'd be frozen stiff.

399
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:37,737
On top of that, Mitsuhiko fainted too.

400
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:39,037
What?

401
00:22:39,037 --> 00:22:41,337
But, he came to right away

402
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:44,437
after Ai warmed him up, right?

403
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:46,137
Thanks for that.

404
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:49,237
But, the culprits were caught, weren't they?

405
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,237
Yep!

406
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,637
Amuro who is part-timing at Poirot,

407
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,237
beat the culprits up, you see.

408
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:57,437
Amuro did?

409
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:59,937
-Yes! -He was awesome, wasn't he?

410
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:01,637
Yeah.

411
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:04,937
Never mind that. Let's eat the cake...

412
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:07,537
Oh! That's right...

413
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:10,237
I forgot the main thing.

414
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:13,137
Cake...

415
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:16,637
It's an exclusive Christmas cake on sale

416
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:18,537
for a limited time only from a cake shop in Yokohama.

417
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:24,437
Remember this when you eat it.

418
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:29,037
Here goes...

419
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,737
What's this?

420
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:41,137
That's a limited time only cake, right down the drain.

421
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:43,437
Come to think of it, those culprits were saying that

422
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:45,037
they would deliberately drop the boxes they deliver,

423
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:48,137
in order to have their faces remembered.
