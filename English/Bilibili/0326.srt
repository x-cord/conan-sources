1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,740
Extra-marital affair, fortune-telling and Three Kingdoms.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,940
Many things connect to the crime.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,467
Heiji, Pops and I will go to the residence of Ryoko Morozumi

9
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,967
on Haidocho 4-chome to conduct investigation

10
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,767
on behalf of Detective Kusukawa,

11
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,267
but she denied our help.

12
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:53,467
What?

13
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:57,367
You just said you're headed home because you finished the job!

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,067
Yeah, that's what we were planning to do,

15
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:03,167
but we passed a fire engine on the way back.

16
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,167
We got concerned and headed back to the residence

17
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,567
and found it blazing outrageously.

18
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:08,567
What?

19
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,767
The Morozumi residence...

20
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:20,867
"Red Horse In The Fire (Investigation)"

21
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:25,067
I tell you, what is that idiot doing anyway.

22
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,267
I bought him a t-shirt

23
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:28,667
that I thought would look good on him and then...

24
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,467
Come, come. They'll be home soon.

25
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,667
What's this key holder?

26
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,867
Remember? A kindly looking old man gave it us on the bus.

27
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:43,067
Oh, the man who gave us his seat

28
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,467
saying that we looked to be carrying a heavy load.

29
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,667
Thank you so very much.

30
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,267
Thanks.

31
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,467
Where are you girls living?

32
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,967
Are you trying to pick us up, mister?

33
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,367
Kazuha, stop it!

34
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:58,367
No. I run an antique shop at Haidocho,

35
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,467
so I thought I'd like you to drop in one day.

36
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,467
Haidocho is nearby.

37
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,867
My house is right next to it on Beikacho 5-chome.

38
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,967
"Takanori Genda (42)" -Oh, 5-chome.

39
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,467
-Shall we go tomorrow? -Okay, let's!

40
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:16,067
Okay, I'll give you the catalog of my shop and a key holder.

41
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,867
Promise, okay?

42
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,267
I wonder what a key holder

43
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,667
that brings flourishing business is all about.

44
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,867
"Police Headquarters" -Here you go, Mouri.

45
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:30,667
The four red horses that were found at the serial arson sites.

46
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,367
I went way out to ask the forensic officers for it,

47
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:36,167
so you'd better find some sort of a clue, or you're going to get it.

48
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:39,967
Well, I'm not the one who want to see the horses, they do.

49
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,467
Hey. I wonder why only the horse left at the first site

50
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,167
is burnt black like this?

51
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:47,067
And only this horse has a stand.

52
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,967
There's something written on the back of the stand.

53
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,567
Rabbit?

54
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,067
Hey. A red horse and rabbit...

55
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,567
Don't tell me that...

56
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,067
Hey. Isn't this Guan Yu?

57
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,767
Guan Yu is the military commander

58
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,267
who appears in the story "Three Kingdoms", isn't he?

59
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,467
Yes. And Guan Yu is also famous

60
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,567
for being the god of prosperity for doing business.

61
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,867
But, what a flashy colored horse he's riding.

62
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,367
Well, this is the Red Rabbit Horse.

63
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:17,267
It's a super horse said to be able to run a thousand miles in a day.

64
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:19,967
Red Rabbit Horse?

65
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,667
Are you saying that this red plastic horse

66
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,867
is a famous horse that appears in "Three Kingdoms"?

67
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,267
Yeah, that's right.

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,867
Try looking at the stand of this horse

69
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,367
that was left at the first scene of the fire.

70
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,667
You can't read the words above and under it because they're burnt,

71
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,667
but you can see the word "rabbit", right?

72
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,867
Yes, true.

73
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:43,267
The only red horse with the word "rabbit" to its name

74
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,367
is the horse that ran around battlefields

75
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,167
with its vicious military commander on its back, Red Rabbit Horse, right?

76
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,267
But, why did the arsonist put the legendary horse

77
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,567
that appears in an old Chinese story

78
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,167
at the sites he set fire to?

79
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,967
Yeah, why?

80
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,367
China...

81
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:01,167
Feng Shui is also from China, isn't it?

82
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:05,167
The man who came to the Morozumi residence before the fire,

83
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,967
didn't he say anything to Ryoko about the old Chinese story?

84
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,467
He didn't say anything about the "Three Kingdoms",

85
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:14,467
but that Sensei of Feng Shui's got a perfect motive.

86
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,567
Huh?

87
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,967
He was looking for the video tape of his affair

88
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:22,567
with Ryoko Morozumi who died in the fire.

89
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:23,567
"Misao Soga (45)"

90
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:27,267
Don't tell me that you think he set the house on fire

91
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:29,867
in order to destroy the tape in the process?

92
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,567
Inspector Yuminaga.

93
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,067
Okay. If you find out anything more, please report to me again.

94
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,367
Yes, sir.

95
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:46,067
It seems that the ones with motive is not limited to that Sensei.

96
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,767
Keiko Gondo, the fortune-teller

97
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,567
that came to the house before the Sensei...

98
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,667
Seems that she's going to get a large sum of estate from her parents

99
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:56,167
being that she's Ryoko's older sister.

100
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,567
Come to think of it, that fortune-teller

101
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,267
was saying that their father just died.

102
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:06,267
But that lady came to borrow money from Ryoko.

103
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,067
If she was going to inherit the estate of her father anyway,

104
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,867
why would she do something like that?

105
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,567
Her father was left to live alone when her mother died.

106
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,767
His only living relatives were his two daughters, Ryoko and Keiko.

107
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:20,067
He seems to have left a will saying that

108
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,367
he would leave his entire estate to Ryoko who had taken a husband,

109
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,867
who took after their family name Morozumi.

110
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,267
I see.

111
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,367
So if Ryoko disappears,

112
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:31,667
the estate that she originally couldn't inherit would be hers.

113
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:32,767
Yeah.

114
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,367
Because there was nothing on the death note that said,

115
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:38,167
if the younger sister dies, don't give it to the older sister.

116
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,867
If so, Ryoko's husband is clean.

117
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:45,367
If his wife dies, he loses the estate and all.

118
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:48,767
No, we can't assume that.

119
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:52,467
Her husband Akira Morozumi is a psychiatrist,

120
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,567
and wanted to demolish that house that they were living in

121
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,467
and build his own hospital.

122
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,967
But since Ryoko was opposed to it,

123
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,367
he seems to have been in a fix.

124
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:05,867
He seems to have been given that land and house by Ryoko's parents.

125
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,567
On top of that, if he knew that

126
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,967
his wife was having an extra-marital affair,

127
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,867
he would have more than enough motive.

128
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:16,667
The problem is all three of them have an alibi.

129
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,867
Yeah. The time the arsonist set fire

130
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:22,367
and put this horse at the site was around 7:30 pm.

131
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:27,667
Her husband came home about 10 minutes before that,

132
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,267
but after that, before even a minute had passed,

133
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,767
he went out drinking with the Sensei of Feng Shui.

134
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,667
And at that time, the fortune-teller

135
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,367
was telling fortunes in a building in front of Haido Station.

136
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,867
The only suspect left is

137
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:46,267
the man who was at the front door

138
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,667
of the Morozumi residence when we got there.

139
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:52,467
The man who tried to leave the catalog of the things in his store

140
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,867
and key holder that would help business prosper,

141
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,467
but was asked to leave.

142
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:01,167
The owner of the antique store, that timid looking man...

143
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:05,267
Unless we can figure out who and where he is...

144
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,267
Hey. I wonder what this is?

145
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,467
See, this horse that was found at the first fire site,

146
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,667
only this horse has a strange protrusion on its body.

147
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,967
Isn't this the feet of a human?

148
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,567
It's melted from the heat of the fire,

149
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,867
but maybe somebody was mounted on this horse.

150
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,767
The military commander that was riding the Red Rabbit Horse was...

151
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,467
Who was he?

152
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,367
Guan... Guan Yu!

153
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,367
Guan Yu?

154
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,767
He's really suspicious after all,

155
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,867
that timid man with the round rim glasses.

156
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,867
Guan Yu is the god of prosperity in business.

157
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,667
The key holder box that the man tried to give away

158
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,867
is just the right size for this, too.

159
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,667
There's no doubt about it.

160
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,867
Huh? The guy that was riding the Red Rabbit Horse was...

161
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,367
We don't have time to waste!

162
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,867
Let's call all the antique shops in the vicinity of Haidocho!

163
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,967
We'd better hurry or he'll get away!

164
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:05,667
I hope that the man you guys say you saw isn't him.

165
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,767
Oh, no! It's already past 23:00!

166
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,967
We're all supposed to go to Tropical Land tomorrow and yet!

167
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,867
Maybe they aren't planning to come home?

168
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,667
Really, what are they doing dragging Conan around with them

169
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,467
till this hour of the day?

170
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,767
They get me so mad!

171
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,567
Let's just forget about those guys and go to sleep.

172
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,167
Wait.

173
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,167
Why don't we hang this sunny boy doll out

174
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,467
on the veranda of dad's room so that it doesn't rain tomorrow?

175
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,867
Although it didn't seem to work last night.

176
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,667
I'm going to wish with all my might tonight so that it works.

177
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,167
Yeah.

178
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,867
I've found them.

179
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,667
I've finally found them.

180
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:51,267
What? He once came up as a suspect?

181
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,667
Are you serious?

182
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,967
Yeah. His name is Takanori Genda.

183
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,867
He's running an antique shop in Haidocho, just as you assumed.

184
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,967
But why'd you suspect him?

185
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:08,767
He was among the crowd of onlookers at the fire site at Rizencho.

186
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,367
He was mumbling something strange while watching the fire.

187
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:15,367
He was saying, "Father..."

188
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:16,767
Father?

189
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,167
His father used to be a firefighter.

190
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,767
When he was still in elementary school,

191
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,467
his father tried to save a person

192
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,067
who couldn't make it out of the fire in time,

193
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,967
and was swallowed by the flames.

194
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,867
Don't tell me that the man is...

195
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:32,367
Yeah. We, the police thought so, too.

196
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:36,867
That he set fire in memory of his father.

197
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,367
That, maybe he thought that if he caused a fire,

198
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,767
his father would come dashing to the scene.

199
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,367
I see. So, not being able to give up hope,

200
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,967
he started setting fires from 1-chome in sequence,

201
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:56,667
and kept chasing the illusion of his father.

202
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,267
What? At 5:00 in the evening,

203
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,967
he stopped by at the shop once and then went home?

204
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,167
Yes, he said he was tired.

205
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,967
He's been distributing catalogs of our store and key holders

206
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:13,367
to people in the neighborhood from morning, so...

207
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,967
Is that key holder the one with a person riding a red horse?

208
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,467
Yeah. It's his work of effort of the statue of Guan Yu.

209
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,367
But he changed it to another key holder

210
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,167
because it didn't take too well to others.

211
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,767
What? He changed it?

212
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,967
Yes. The key holder that he distributed today

213
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,167
should've been one of a beckoning cat.

214
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:35,167
Is something wrong with the shop owner, officer?

215
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,167
No, not really.

216
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,367
Don't get so angry, Ran.

217
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,267
We can't go home for a while longer.

218
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,567
Gosh.

219
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,567
You were pretty knowledgeable about the story "Three Kingdoms", right?

220
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,067
What? Yes.

221
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,767
The military commander who was mounted on the Red Rabbit Horse

222
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,667
was called Lu Bu, right?

223
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,767
Right. But later, the horse was given to Cao Cao

224
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,267
and in the end, it went to Guan Yu, who was the last to own it.

225
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,367
Are you sure about it?

226
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,867
Yes, because the key holder I was given of Guan Yu today

227
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,267
-is also riding a Red Rabbit Horse! -What?

228
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:07,267
Somebody gave you a key holder of Guan Yu riding the Red Rabbit Horse?

229
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,567
Yes.

230
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:12,367
Hey, Pops! What's the address of your detective agency?

231
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,667
I'm asking you what's the address? What chome is it on?

232
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,367
Fifth chome.

233
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:20,067
Okay, I got it.

234
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,567
What did Pops say?

235
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,067
I'm not sure,

236
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,867
but he said he's on his way home now, and told us to not go outside.

237
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,567
Great.

238
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:30,267
I've been hearing strange noises from the front door from a while ago,

239
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,867
and it's giving me the creeps.

240
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:46,047
What? Genda lives in Rizencho?

241
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,747
Yeah. What about it?

242
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:52,047
When Ryoko's husband came back home at about 7:20 pm,

243
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:56,047
we saw Mr. Genda near the house in Haidocho.

244
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,147
The bus that Ran rode is probably the one

245
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:03,147
that goes from Haidocho via Beikacho and then to Rizencho.

246
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:06,647
Although it's true that Mr. Genda intended to go home once,

247
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:09,847
for one reason or another, he returned to that house.

248
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:10,847
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,047
Rizencho is the place where the first fire occurred, right?

250
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:17,847
Yeah. The house that burned was right near his home.

251
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:19,547
The inhabitant seems to have been a good friend of his parents,

252
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:22,347
as well as a good customer of his shop.

253
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:25,247
Which means that the real reason he set fire to the house

254
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:27,447
was to hide the fact that the item that he sold was fake,

255
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:30,847
and before anyone found out, he burned the house down.

256
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,647
Yeah.

257
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,247
But I don't understand.

258
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,747
Why didn't you detain him at the station

259
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:37,547
being as suspicious as he was?

260
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:42,047
I guess the intuition of a police detective within me

261
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:44,647
has gotten rusty.

262
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:50,347
The police car has arrived in front of the detective agency.

263
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,547
Hey, don't tell me that...

264
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,747
Genda?

265
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:06,347
-Heiji. -What is it? What happened?

266
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:10,047
After the phone call just a while ago, that man came here,

267
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,947
and asked to have the key holder that he gave us in the bus back.

268
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:15,347
We asked him why, and he said...

269
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,247
There's going to be a fire.

270
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:20,447
I'm going to set fire again!

271
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:22,447
Then, he broke down in tears.

272
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:26,547
Having no choice, I called the police, but...

273
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,847
Hey, Genda. Is it true?

274
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,647
Did you really do it?

275
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,547
I'm sorry!

276
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,147
Inspector Yuminaga!

277
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,047
We'll take the suspect over to the Beika Police Department for now.

278
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:46,947
Yeah.

279
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:52,547
Judging from the looks of it,

280
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:54,847
it seems he'll spit it out right away.

281
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,347
Hey, Hattori.

282
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:58,847
Doesn't this seem familiar?

283
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,447
Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing.

284
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:06,447
The renown Detective Poirot series, a masterpiece of all masterpieces.

285
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:10,047
It's just like "The ABC Murders".

286
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,547
The killer kills people who have the same initials

287
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,447
as the name of the place

288
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,247
and kills them off one by one in order of ABC.

289
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:20,247
Then, an ABC time schedule is placed near the corpse

290
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:23,747
to make it look as if it were the doings of a serial killer.

291
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:29,547
And finally, he kills the actual target "C" that he is after.

292
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:32,847
He hides the orderliness of a planned murder

293
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:35,747
under the guise of a disorderly random murder.

294
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:37,447
It sure is similar!

295
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:40,647
Moreover, that timid man, the arsonist,

296
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:43,247
who was taken away by the police just a while ago.

297
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:46,447
In that novel, he is arrested once because the real arsonist

298
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,647
puts him under the illusion that he is the one committing the crime.

299
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,447
Genda sure resembles that character.

300
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:55,247
It seems that we'd better look into this a little deeper.

301
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,247
Yeah. We'd better check out the sites of the fire of 4-chome

302
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,147
that smells of tricks involved.

303
00:16:01,347 --> 00:16:03,447
What? You're going to Haidocho 4-chome

304
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:06,047
where the fire occurred last night?

305
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,047
You mean now?

306
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,247
Yeah. There's something bothering me.

307
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:12,447
I'm thinking of taking him along, too.

308
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,247
Never mind the fire!

309
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:17,747
We're all scheduled to go to Tropical Land today, aren't we?

310
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:20,147
I don't know if it's topical or pickles,

311
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,747
but this case is sure going to put us in a pickle

312
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,947
if we don't solve it fast.

313
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:24,347
Case?

314
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:27,447
But the arsonist was arrested last night, wasn't he?

315
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:30,347
Yeah! The man with the round rimmed glasses

316
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:33,247
that gave us the key holder of the red horse.

317
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:39,747
No. Maybe that man is being mind controlled.

318
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:42,047
Mind controlled?

319
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,047
Think about it.

320
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:47,047
Mr. Akira Morozumi is a psychiatrist.

321
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,947
Mr. Misao Soga is a Sensei of Feng Shui.

322
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:53,447
And Keiko Gondo is a fortune-teller.

323
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,347
All three of them seem to be able to manipulate the hearts of people,

324
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,547
and have the motive to cause the fire.

325
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,247
Don't you think something smells?

326
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:03,847
But those three have alibis.

327
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:07,047
Right, so let's go and check it out again.

328
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:12,047
Maybe a super delicious story is hidden behind all this, right?

329
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,547
It's kind of eerie.

330
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,247
Really, I can't understand the feeling of somebody

331
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,547
who wants to come to a scary place like this.

332
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,247
Don't come then!

333
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,647
I can't help it!

334
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,147
I want the case to be solved as soon as possible,

335
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,847
and go to Tropical Land.

336
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,547
We were a bit concerned about the case, too.

337
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,847
Hey, hey.

338
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,647
You've got a huge family accompanying you today, don't you?

339
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,347
Hello.

340
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:37,547
And, did Genda confess?

341
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,847
His answer is an unchanging, "I don't know".

342
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:42,747
"I don't know"?

343
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:44,847
Yeah. According to him,

344
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,847
he says there's another him within himself,

345
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:51,447
and that guy may be going around setting fire.

346
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:55,947
He seems to have had the habit of sleepwalking since he was a child.

347
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,447
And that habit seems to have reoccurred recently,

348
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:00,947
so he's been seeing a doctor for treatment.

349
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,147
And don't tell me his doctor is...

350
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:06,547
Yeah, Akira Morozumi.

351
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:10,747
He seems to have prescribed a tranquilizer and gave it to Genda.

352
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,047
But he looked really surprised

353
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,247
at hearing that Genda was the arsonist.

354
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:19,347
Come to think of it, the man called Soga also looked surprised.

355
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,447
Soga and Genda used to see each other a lot

356
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,647
at the antique marketplace.

357
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,247
And Soga seems to be the one

358
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,347
who recommended Genda to go to Morozumi's hospital.

359
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:29,647
Misao Soga is an odd character who quit the medical university part way

360
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,747
and got absorbed in Feng Shui.

361
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:36,047
The reason why Genda was in that area that day

362
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,147
was because Soga had told him that if he goes to the houses there,

363
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:42,547
the direction is good, so he might find some luck.

364
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:45,647
Then, just as Heiji had said,

365
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,447
he had some connection with Mr. Genda.

366
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,247
Which means that Genda may have some connection

367
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,947
with the fortune-teller Keiko Gondo, too?

368
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:56,947
No, I haven't gone that far yet,

369
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:59,447
but that lady smells fishy.

370
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,147
When Ryoko was found,

371
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:04,047
I saw her gripping this small cushion really hard.

372
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,647
I had them all come this morning to headquarters

373
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,247
and asked them if this looked familiar to them,

374
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,647
but only that woman Gondo turned pale

375
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,347
and left in the wink of an eye.

376
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,647
Isn't that a dying message?

377
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,947
Why did you let her go?

378
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:22,547
The arsonist had already confessed,

379
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:24,447
and that lady already had an alibi

380
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,447
so we couldn't detain her.

381
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,647
Well, that's only if the time of the arson

382
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,747
is correct as you both insist.

383
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:33,747
Well, would you like to confirm for yourself?

384
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:36,947
The one who testified is the boy next door.

385
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,647
Really! It's really true!

386
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,247
I saw it!

387
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,847
When the opening song of Kamen Yaiba started,

388
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:50,047
I saw a large shadow of a horse on the curtain of the living room!

389
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:51,947
Is it true, madam?

390
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:52,947
I wonder...

391
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:55,947
because I entered the living room at 7:30 pm

392
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:57,947
and turned on the lights right away,

393
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,547
so I'm not sure if there was a shadow there or not.

394
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,447
I'm not lying!

395
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,847
Will you show us that room?

396
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,347
It's this room.

397
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:10,347
If so...

398
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:13,647
the shadow of the horse was projected on this curtain.

399
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,447
True.

400
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:23,447
But, why was your son watching TV in a dark room?

401
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,747
It seems all the kids in this neighborhood do so now.

402
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:29,347
It's like watching a movie and really cool!

403
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:31,747
But sonny,

404
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,847
make sure you turn on the lights when you watch TV, okay?

405
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,147
Otherwise, our eyes will go bad really quickly.

406
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,747
Just like him?

407
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:42,447
Maybe the shadow of the horse

408
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:46,547
was already projected before 7:30 pm.

409
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:50,347
The shadow that is created by flames get light and dark

410
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:51,447
and sways a lot too,

411
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:54,947
so you can't tell if it's a horse or not at times.

412
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:57,047
That's not true!

413
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,447
Because I was watching baseball all the while

414
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:03,247
until the clock on top of the TV struck the time for Kamen Yaiba, but...

415
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,547
It got really bright outside the window,

416
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,047
and I saw the shadow.

417
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,147
It was time for the Kamen Yaiba song.

418
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:13,147
Then, were you watching the baseball game with the room dark, too?

419
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,147
Yes.

420
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,647
But if it's dark, you can't see the time of the clock, right?

421
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,047
I could see it

422
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,647
because it was dimly light outside the window.

423
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:26,547
Besides, the shadow of the horse wasn't swaying.

424
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,647
Hey, Heiji!

425
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:33,247
Conan!

426
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,247
Look really closely for it, Hattori.

427
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:36,847
I'm sure it's somewhere.

428
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,547
Yeah. The evidence that will prove our deduction

429
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:41,147
is here some place for sure.

430
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:43,447
I found it!

431
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:45,547
It's an incandescent electric light bulb.

432
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:47,347
I've found one here, too.

433
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,847
Here and there in burnt places,

434
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,947
there are burnt remains of tissue paper.

435
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:52,547
Which means that...

436
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:55,247
Yeah. If this trick is used,

437
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,147
you don't have to be here to set fire to the place.

438
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,947
All we need to find out now is

439
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:03,947
how the culprit manipulated Mr. Genda.

440
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,647
We've got to find proof of that.

441
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,647
"Next Episode" -These are Mr. Genda's shoe marks.

442
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,847
It's the same as the shoes that's in the shoes cabinet.

443
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,447
There's something strange in the wastebasket.

444
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:57,447
A soiled pair of socks and a burnt shirt.

445
00:23:58,547 --> 00:23:59,747
No.

446
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,747
It's not a wiretap.

447
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:04,947
But we found something unbelievable.

448
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:13,347
Next Conan, "Red Horse In The Fire (Case Solved)"

449
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:16,515
Next Conan's Hint:

450
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,515
"Key holder"

451
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,415
In the next episode, Hattori and I will have a hot deduction.

452
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,115
It's hot! My butt's on fire!

453
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:23,415
Hey, hey.
