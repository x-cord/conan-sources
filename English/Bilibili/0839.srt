1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,970
That's in the opposite direction.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,670
Oh my God. What we are going to do?

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,570
We could head back but the sun's about to set.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,870
Is there any place nearby where we can spend the night?

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,070
"Shozo Shimomura (62)" -There's a Japanese inn

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,470
"Local historian" -at the foot of the mountain.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,370
Let's go spend the night there.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,470
Thank you so very much.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,870
Not at all.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,070
What's that sound?

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,070
It's the voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin).

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,470
A canvas stained black with crime.

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,070
Everyone also hears the creepy groan.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,370
The secret of the long-nosed goblin opens the curtains to the case.

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,570
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:39,928
"Voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin)"

20
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:45,428
How beautiful.

21
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:50,228
Where's the money coming from?

22
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:52,128
What're you talking about?

23
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,028
"Shigeo Imazu (51)" -I'm talking about the money

24
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:55,528
that's not listed on the statement.

25
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,228
"Shoji Mayama (44)" -There's no such thing.

26
00:02:57,228 --> 00:03:01,928
If you keep it up, I'm going to sue you for slander, Imazu!

27
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:05,528
I'd like to see you try!

28
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,628
What a loser.

29
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:19,028
Well, that sure was a nice bath.

30
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:20,028
You can say that again.

31
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:21,928
I'm hungry.

32
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:24,728
That's him. Thank you for earlier.

33
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,628
Not at all.

34
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:30,428
Oh, Sensei, this way please.

35
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:31,428
Yeah.

36
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:40,128
"Mr. Shimomura Publishing Party"

37
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,228
So he's a novelist.

38
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,328
Sensei, could you give a comment?

39
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:51,328
9.50am, huh?

40
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:54,128
There's one hour to go before the bus comes.

41
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:57,728
Dad, Conan, they say there's a cave nearby.

42
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,128
Would you like to go see it?

43
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,428
I guess so. We've got nothing else to so anyway.

44
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:04,128
"Kokushu Historical Site: Welcome to the Tengu Cave"

45
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,928
We were lucky that the inn let our leave our baggage there.

46
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,028
Oh! I think it's over there.

47
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:12,428
Let's see.

48
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:16,828
What was that?

49
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,228
Sorry.

50
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,728
It's fine.

51
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,228
I wonder what he was doing there.

52
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,028
It's closed.

53
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:28,028
What?

54
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,228
Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,628
I'll open up now.

56
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:38,228
"Yasutaro Hirai (29)" -We open at 10am.

57
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,928
"Visiting Hours 10am to 5pm"

58
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,728
Please come in.

59
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:56,328
Okay.

60
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,628
What?

61
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:58,928
What's the matter?

62
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,828
The mask is gone.

63
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,328
Is this what the inside looks like?

64
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:08,128
Yes. It's for the people who can't go all the way inside

65
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:09,928
because the corridor is narrow.

66
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,328
Take a look, Conan.

67
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,328
There's a small shrine part way through the cliff.

68
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,828
That's called the shrine of Tengu.

69
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:18,728
Huh? What is that?

70
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,428
This!

71
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:24,328
He's hanging from the neck?

72
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:25,528
What?

73
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,028
Oh no!

74
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,228
Oh, it fell!

75
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:32,428
Let's hurry inside!

76
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,628
Please watch your head.

77
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:40,728
Are you all right, Dad?

78
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,828
It sure is narrow here.

79
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,628
We're outside.

80
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:50,428
That way!

81
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:09,328
Mayor!

82
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,828
There's no pulse. He's dead.

83
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:14,128
Ran, call the police.

84
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,128
This area is out of service range.

85
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,928
You've got to go back to the inn.

86
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,428
Okay.

87
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:33,028
This is probably what happened.

88
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:35,928
The mayor put a rope around the shrine and hung himself,

89
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,628
but unable to withstand the weight, it broke.

90
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:43,828
But, why did he choose a high place like that?

91
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:45,628
What's this?

92
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,028
It's a scaffold.

93
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:53,528
We could go right below the shrine before.

94
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:56,628
But now it's been disassembled.

95
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:59,728
When I came here yesterday in the morning, it was here.

96
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,728
I wonder who disassembled it.

97
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,828
Can you climb up without a scaffold?

98
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,128
There!

99
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:17,328
No good. I can't climb it at all.

100
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:20,428
There's a trick to it.

101
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,528
Shimomura Sensei!

102
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,828
So, we meet again.

103
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:32,028
Even if there's a trick to it, this cliff is...

104
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,928
This is...

105
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,828
He's the mayor. He's dead.

106
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,428
Speaking of this cliff, Mr. Hirai,

107
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:45,028
you boys used to climb up all time, didn't you?

108
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:48,628
Yes. You always scolded us for it.

109
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:51,428
Why's he called Sensei?

110
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:55,328
He's a school teacher. The principal of a school.

111
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:58,228
After retiring two years ago,

112
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,728
he's been continuing his life's work of researching Tengu.

113
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,728
Then, the book you published was also about Tengu?

114
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:08,028
My former students paid for it.

115
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,628
They even had a party for me last night too.

116
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,328
I'm really grateful for their support.

117
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:18,228
Are the mayor and Mr. Imazu also former students?

118
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:21,528
That's right. Although they were in different grades.

119
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:25,028
There it is again.

120
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:28,428
That voice of Tengu, what is it actually?

121
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:31,228
I wonder what it is.

122
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,828
Mayama?

123
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:40,828
Who is he?

124
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,428
Mr. Imazu.

125
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:45,728
He used to be the mayor until he was beaten by Mr. Mayama

126
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,628
in the last mayoral election.

127
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:52,228
Oh. Mr. Imazu, could I ask you a few questions?

128
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,328
Who's asking?

129
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:56,128
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

130
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,328
A detective.

131
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:01,928
How long were you in front of the cave?

132
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,828
From around 8.30am.

133
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:07,528
Did you see Mr. Mayama come?

134
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:08,528
Yeah.

135
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,728
He came at around 9am.

136
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:11,928
Was he alone?

137
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,128
Right.

138
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:17,828
By the way, should I tell you why I was in front of the cave?

139
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:19,228
Yes, please.

140
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,028
Last night.

141
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,028
Are you blackmailing me?

142
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:28,028
How much do you want?

143
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:30,628
All right. And, where should I meet you?

144
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:33,128
Tomorrow morning at 9am, at the Tengu Cave.

145
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:34,728
I got it.

146
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:36,428
I'm just assuming

147
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,828
but I think he was being blackmailed over off the books money he received

148
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,928
during the election.

149
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:44,528
That's why I was staking out in front of the cave.

150
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:57,028
However, he didn't come out no matter how long I waited.

151
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:59,228
I was trying to decide what to do

152
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,428
when I ran into all of you.

153
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,928
Did anyone else enter the cave during that time?

154
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:05,928
Nobody.

155
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:08,528
-Mr. Imazu. -What?

156
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:11,228
You're a building contractor, aren't you?

157
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:15,128
Are you the one who disassembled the scaffold?

158
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,228
That's right.

159
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:18,328
When did you take it apart?

160
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,628
Yesterday afternoon.

161
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:22,928
When Mr. Mayama called me and told me to do so.

162
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:24,728
That's strange.

163
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,728
If he was planning to hang himself by the shrine,

164
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:29,228
it would've been easier to leave the scaffoldings up.

165
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,828
Why did he do it the day after it was taken down?

166
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:33,328
I don't think he planned it

167
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,928
but impulsively thought of committing suicide.

168
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:39,028
No, no, it was planned.

169
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:42,928
Because he got ready the rope to hang himself with.

170
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:45,328
In other words, it's like this.

171
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:49,028
At 9 in the morning, unaware that Mr. Imazu was watching him,

172
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:52,528
Mr. Mayama entered the cave alone.

173
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,728
After entering the cave, he locked it from the inside

174
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:57,928
and stole the mask of Tengu that was in the office.

175
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,828
He then, climbed up the cliff,

176
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:02,928
tied the rope that he brought along to the pillar of the shrine

177
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,528
and hung himself.

178
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:08,428
What about the blackmailer?

179
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:10,428
He didn't come, then?

180
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,928
He probably did come,

181
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:16,128
but saw Mr. Imazu standing outside and decided to leave.

182
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,328
I see.

183
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,728
All we need to figure out now is the motive.

184
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:23,428
Do you have any idea?

185
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:32,828
Huh?

186
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,528
What else?

187
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,228
Death spots?

188
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:47,628
It's odd. If he hung himself, they should appear on his legs.

189
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,028
Which means...

190
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:54,228
This is not suicide!

191
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:07,095
I wonder when the killer went into the cave and left.

192
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:10,495
There's no guarantee that Mr. Imazu is telling the truth,

193
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:13,295
or he could've just carelessly overlooked something.

194
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:17,795
But, it's a fact that when we came the door was locked.

195
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:25,095
I'll try going up then.

196
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,095
Hey, Conan, it's dangerous!

197
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:35,695
I'll be fine. Don't worry!

198
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:54,595
5 minutes.

199
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,195
This is the place we met Mr. Shimomura yesterday.

200
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:07,395
That's why we heard the voice of Tengu.

201
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:11,495
He probably thought that he couldn't escape from the blackmailer.

202
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,195
That's the kind of guy he was.

203
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:16,295
When things started going south, he'd flee.

204
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,395
He's right.

205
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:19,495
No, that's not true.

206
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:22,795
His conscious bothered him.

207
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:27,295
The Kurama Tengu is a symbol of torturing evil.

208
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:28,895
Maybe that was the message he was trying to convey

209
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,995
by wearing the Tengu mask.

210
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:33,795
It was fortunate that his body swayed.

211
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,495
If it fell straight down,

212
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,195
the corpse would've suffered extensive damage.

213
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:39,195
Huh?

214
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,495
Why did he sway?

215
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,695
It was probably the wind, but...

216
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,995
I wonder if we can really go through such a narrow place.

217
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:54,795
Yes, you can. Watch your head.

218
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:00,495
I believe that the call from the blackmailer

219
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:03,395
as well as Mr. Shimomura's publishing party

220
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:06,395
triggered this incident.

221
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,695
I see.

222
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:26,995
I found it.

223
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:34,295
So then the case is closed.

224
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,695
Dad!

225
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,895
This is what I'd like to say,

226
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:47,295
but we'd just be playing into the killer's hands.

227
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,295
What?

228
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:50,495
Please check the back of the victim.

229
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,695
You'll see death spots.

230
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,295
You're right.

231
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,795
If he hung himself, his death spots would appear on his legs.

232
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:01,795
They appeared on his back because he was lying on his back.

233
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:05,995
Which means he was killed lying on his back then hung?

234
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,695
That's impossible.

235
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:11,295
How did the killer carry the corpse to a place that high?

236
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:12,395
I guess so.

237
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,295
Even if it were done, there's no merit in doing something like that.

238
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:16,295
Mr. Hirai.

239
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:17,295
Yes, sir.

240
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:21,295
Please try to recall what you saw back then on the monitor.

241
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,695
I saw,

242
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,795
the mayor hanging.

243
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,395
He was hung and what situation was he in?

244
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,295
He was swaying.

245
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:35,595
He was swaying so he didn't crash onto the scaffold.

246
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,495
He's got to be thankful to the wind.

247
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:38,995
Was it the wind?

248
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,095
On the monitor, water from a hot spring

249
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,295
was on display in the foreground.

250
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:47,295
The hot spring water was flowing just like it is now.

251
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:50,395
Maybe it swayed because it was right after he hung himself?

252
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,495
If he struggles, he'd sway, right?

253
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,095
Judging from the death spots,

254
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:56,195
it couldn't have been immediately afterwards.

255
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:58,895
Then why was his corpse swaying?

256
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:00,895
He made himself sway.

257
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,495
The corpse did it on its own?

258
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,295
That's ridiculous!

259
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:07,895
Not the corpse.

260
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,795
What we saw on the monitor was

261
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:12,795
the killer pretending to be the corpse.

262
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:14,995
What?

263
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,095
At 9 in the morning,

264
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,495
Mr. Mayama came to the cave just as his blackmailer had told him to

265
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,895
the night before.

266
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:24,395
The killer was waiting inside.

267
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:27,095
He was the one who locked the door from the inside.

268
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:32,895
It was so that he had an hour to commit the crime

269
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:35,795
until Mr. Hirai came to open the door at 10am.

270
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:41,195
The killer takes Mr. Mayama all the way into the cave.

271
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:46,295
And with the rope that he brought with him strangled Mr. Mayama.

272
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:52,795
Then he wore Mr. Mayama's top and pants

273
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:55,195
as well as wore the mask of Tengu,

274
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:59,795
merely to hide his own face.

275
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,995
The killer climbed the cliff up to the shrine.

276
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,895
He tied one end of the rope that he strangled Mr. Mayama with

277
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:07,195
onto the pillar,

278
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,495
then broke it and dropped it down.

279
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,595
Next, he tied a separate onto himself like a harness

280
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:17,895
and hung himself from the pillar.

281
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:20,195
I believe that the rope was tied

282
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:22,995
so that when he let go, the rope would come off.

283
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:24,795
He swung himself to gain momentum

284
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,695
and jumped over to a rock nearby where he could land on.

285
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:31,695
He landed on a ledge that was not in view of the monitor.

286
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,195
Please check it.

287
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:36,695
You should be able to find a scrap of the victim's top there.

288
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,995
Here it is.

289
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:48,195
He then put the top and pants back onto to Mr. Mayama,

290
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:52,395
and made him wear the mask of Tengu.

291
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:55,895
Doesn't everything fall too much in place?

292
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:57,595
How the killer flee?

293
00:17:57,595 --> 00:18:01,395
How did he know that you people were coming?

294
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:03,295
The voice of Tengu.

295
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:08,795
Tengus don't exist.

296
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,195
It's actually the sound of the wind.

297
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:14,795
It occurs when the door of the cave is opened and closed.

298
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:18,295
Although very slight the voices of people can also be heard.

299
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:19,895
This place is so narrow.

300
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:22,395
How are we going to get the corpse out of here?

301
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:26,495
The killer heard us and hid.

302
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:28,195
Oh, I see.

303
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,795
And, who's the killer?

304
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:33,295
Mr. Hirai is excluded

305
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:36,895
because he witnessed the body falling with us.

306
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:39,295
-Then... -It's not me!

307
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:43,295
Me neither. The killer probably climbed the cliff and fled.

308
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:46,795
Right. You should search the mountains immediately!

309
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,095
Actually, there's something strange

310
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,895
about the Tengu's voice.

311
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:55,195
The first time we heard the Tengu's voice

312
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:57,995
is after Ran left here.

313
00:18:57,995 --> 00:18:59,395
Okay.

314
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:02,395
In other words, the first Tengu's voice

315
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:05,395
was when Ran opened the entrance door.

316
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:07,595
"First voice"

317
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:08,795
The second time the voice was heard

318
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,395
was just before Mr. Imazu appeared.

319
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:14,295
So, it was the sound of Mr. Imazu opening the door.

320
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:15,395
"Second voice"

321
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:19,895
No one could've entered or exited between them.

322
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:24,895
Mr. Shimomura, when did you come into the cave?

323
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:28,295
When? Right after you people came in.

324
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,795
That is right after the first voice as you put it.

325
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,995
If so, you would've had to pass Ran.

326
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:37,695
You can't possibly tell me that you didn't pass her

327
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:40,295
because it's so narrow.

328
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,195
Maybe it was a little later.

329
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:45,695
You must've misheard me.

330
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:48,895
Do you still insist on lying?

331
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,595
I'm not lying.

332
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:53,295
When we met you yesterday,

333
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,295
you had that cloth hanging from your neck,

334
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,295
but today it's wrapped around your neck.

335
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:59,395
Isn't it because you have a wound under it

336
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,395
that you don't want anyone to see?

337
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,995
Wounds of when you scraped yourself against uneven rocks.

338
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,595
Don't be ridiculous!

339
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:09,195
I got these while I was walking through the mountains.

340
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,595
You can easily get away if it's just one scrape.

341
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:16,495
But can you explain the scrapes on your shins and thighs?

342
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:20,895
Inspector, please examine Mr. Mayama's body.

343
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:24,595
His clothes are torn, but he has no wounds.

344
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:31,895
I've confirmed it.

345
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:39,495
Is the rope that you used to fall inside the backpack?

346
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:40,695
That's right.

347
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,695
But why, Sensei?

348
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:47,495
Several days ago when I was walking through the mountains,

349
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:49,795
I ran into a surveyor.

350
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,895
I asked him what he was surveying,

351
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:54,995
he said it was to turn this mountain

352
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:58,095
into a landfill for industrial waste.

353
00:20:58,095 --> 00:21:00,695
Mr. Mayama received undocumented contributions for his campaign

354
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:03,995
from the industry workers, for agreeing to this project.

355
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:06,795
I couldn't forgive him for it.

356
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:10,495
He was willing to destroy the town's valuable cultural property

357
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:12,495
for his own benefit.

358
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:15,895
I had to do what I did to stop him.

359
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:18,295
For the sake of the town, I had to become Tengu

360
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,895
and bring the hammer of justice down on him.

361
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:25,095
I pretended to be the blackmailer and summoned Mr. Mayama to come.

362
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:28,595
I figured he wouldn't come unless I did so.

363
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,295
I was surprised that the scaffolds where taken apart

364
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:33,395
but I didn't fret.

365
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,695
It would've been simpler if I'd made it

366
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:39,895
to look like Mr. Mayama's body crashed onto the scaffolds,

367
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:42,895
but I couldn't be that devilish.

368
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:45,195
It was just as I planned that

369
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,595
Mr. Hirai would witness the moment of the fall at 10am.

370
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:52,595
I meant to flee while he went to call the police.

371
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,995
But, I didn't think

372
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:57,395
he would be bringing the Great Detective Mouri with him.

373
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,995
It would've been the same even if I didn't come.

374
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:02,595
Because Mr. Imazu was outside.

375
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,195
True.

376
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:40,495
It sure was some sharp deduction work, if I may say so myself.

377
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,295
He's become a real Tengu.

378
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:47,295
All his bragging may actually make his nose grow long.

379
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:57,095
We ate before you because you didn't get up.

380
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:58,895
The perp of the murder case

381
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,995
that happened the day before yesterday was caught.

382
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:05,295
Beautiful lady.

383
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:13,095
What? You want me to lift up my hem?

384
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:18,295
It's you after all.

385
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:24,295
Next Conan, "The Last Gift"

386
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,338
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:29,538
"Wristwatch"

388
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:30,938
A beauty appears again in the next episode.

389
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,138
Leave it to me.

390
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,138
You're wearing that lewd look again.
