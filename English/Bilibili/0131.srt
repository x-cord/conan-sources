1
00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:03.282
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.382
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:07.582
An audience of 50,000 taken hostage.

4
00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:09.582
For both the match and the case, the end draws near.

5
00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:11.182
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:13.182
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:15.482
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:58.795
"January 1st, National Stadium, Emperor's Cup Finals"

9
00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.895
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

10
00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.995
went to watch the Emperor's Cup game finals.

11
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:06.995
A bullet is fired into a soccer ball

12
00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:08.495
right before the very eyes of the five children.

13
00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:13.595
Just then, the director of Nichiuri TV

14
00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:14.895
receives a threatening phone call,

15
00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:17.895
while they are broadcasting the game.

16
00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:19.795
The blackmailer says, "Get 50,000,000 yen ready.

17
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.795
If you cancel the game or let anybody out of the stadium,

18
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.795
I'll fire and kill indiscriminately."

19
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.495
The criminal demands ransom

20
00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:29.995
holding everyone in the stadium hostage.

21
00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:35.995
A bag with the cash that is demanded

22
00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:38.595
is placed in the specified spot,

23
00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.895
and the officers charge at once to nab the criminal.

24
00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:50.695
"Indiscriminate Murder Threat at the Stadium (Part 2)"

25
00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:59.095
He's come, Inspector!

26
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.295
He's a man wearing sunglasses, dressed in a gray coat

27
00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:02.895
and wearing a white mask.

28
00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:05.495
The man just picked up the bag.

29
00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:06.795
Is there anyone else around?

30
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:10.095
-No, he's alone. -Okay.

31
00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:11.895
Nab him!

32
00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:21.095
The gun! Look for the gun!

33
00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:24.795
It's nowhere!

34
00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.695
Talk! Where is it? Where's the gun?

35
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:29.295
Don't touch!

36
00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:32.395
Don't touch my partner!

37
00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:34.595
I'll shoot at the audience!

38
00:03:34.595 --> 00:03:36.595
Get away from him!

39
00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:40.195
Partner?

40
00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:43.495
So the police were snooping around, after all.

41
00:03:43.495 --> 00:03:46.595
Hey, what's this all about?

42
00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:48.995
Mr. Kaneko of Nichiuri TV.

43
00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.195
Well, that's...

44
00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:53.395
Taking me lightly, huh?

45
00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:55.795
I guess one person will have to die to set an example!

46
00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:58.095
Hey, wait!

47
00:03:58.095 --> 00:04:00.495
We're in a fix.

48
00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:03.395
Well, I wonder who I should kill?

49
00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:06.095
I've gotta whole load of targets to choose from.

50
00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:13.495
Don't do that!

51
00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:16.395
We'll do as you demand, so...

52
00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.895
We'll pull out too!

53
00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:21.095
We don't want any victims.

54
00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.095
All right.

55
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.895
I'll give you a chance to make up for what you did.

56
00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:29.395
-Make up? -Yeah.

57
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.495
I'm going to have Nichiuru TV who went out

58
00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:35.295
and called the police give us additional ransom.

59
00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:37.095
It'll be 10 billion yen.

60
00:04:37.095 --> 00:04:39.995
Get 10 billion yen before the game ends

61
00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:43.795
and place it at the same exit of gate 18.

62
00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:46.395
If it's not ready by that time,

63
00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.895
I'm killing somebody in the audience.

64
00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:50.695
10 billion?

65
00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.195
That's outrageous.

66
00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:55.495
What's this? Are you saying that you can't pay my share?

67
00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.895
My share?

68
00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:59.395
So, there's only one more of them left?

69
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:01.995
Hey, is there anyone among the eight

70
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:04.495
that we marked a while ago using the phone?

71
00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:07.895
No, Inspector. Everyone here is absorbed in the game.

72
00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:10.795
Likewise. There seems to be no such person here either.

73
00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:13.895
There is no one who seems to be on the phone here either, Inspector.

74
00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:15.395
It can't be!

75
00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:19.195
Where on earth is he calling from?

76
00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:20.795
No use, no use.

77
00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:23.095
No matter how much you strain your eyes,

78
00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:25.295
you officers would never be able to see me.

79
00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:27.795
-What? -Right.

80
00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:29.695
And will you order the officers who are scattered among the audience

81
00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:32.795
to leave right this minute?

82
00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:34.695
I'm sure you're aware

83
00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:38.395
that I'm holding 56,000 people hostage.

84
00:05:38.395 --> 00:05:40.595
You know what will happen if you go against me.

85
00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:51.895
Okay. I'll order all of the officers to leave right away.

86
00:05:51.895 --> 00:05:56.295
Come off it. I can see right through you.

87
00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:58.195
The man who is smoking a cigarette

88
00:05:58.195 --> 00:06:02.195
sitting to the left side of the aisle on the very top stairs.

89
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.895
The woman who is hiding her face with a newspaper

90
00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:05.295
sitting in the second row from the bottom,

91
00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:07.795
in the center of the stand right up ahead.

92
00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:11.195
The two men leaning against the railing of the front row,

93
00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:14.095
diagonally in front of her...

94
00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:16.295
They're all officers, aren't they?

95
00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:17.995
I'll tell you about some more.

96
00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:19.995
The fat man beside the goal

97
00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:22.995
to the right of the bleachers right up front.

98
00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:25.395
Hey, Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi.

99
00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:27.895
You guys are by the back stand, aren't you?

100
00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:29.195
Yeah.

101
00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:32.295
Don't you see someone looking through binoculars or something?

102
00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:34.395
There are many.

103
00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:37.095
They seem to be looking at the faces of the players

104
00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:38.795
who are leaving the field during half time.

105
00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:41.595
Idiot! He's looking towards the stands,

106
00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:42.995
not the field!

107
00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:45.695
Furthermore, he's using a phone too.

108
00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:47.195
Among the 56,000 people here,

109
00:06:47.195 --> 00:06:50.995
there could only be one person doing both.

110
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.295
I found him!

111
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.895
There's a weird guy looking around the stadium!

112
00:06:54.895 --> 00:06:56.995
Where is that guy, Ayumi?

113
00:06:56.995 --> 00:07:00.795
In the center of the back stand on the very top stairs.

114
00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.595
But it looks like he's listening to music,

115
00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:04.095
not talking on the phone.

116
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:05.595
-Music? -Yes.

117
00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:08.195
Because he is wearing an earphone.

118
00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.195
Something strange is attached in the middle of the cord.

119
00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:12.595
What a funny looking earphone.

120
00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:13.995
I see.

121
00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:16.695
He had an earphone microphone attached to his cellular.

122
00:07:16.695 --> 00:07:19.595
That's why the officers overlooked him.

123
00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:21.495
Ayumi! I'll be right over,

124
00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:23.495
so don't you dare take your eyes off him.

125
00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:25.395
-He's the one! -What?

126
00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:33.295
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

127
00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:35.795
Genta, Mitsuhiko.

128
00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:37.895
Ayumi, which one is the criminal?

129
00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:39.495
He's the one!

130
00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:42.995
The hat, the coat...

131
00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.895
He sure does look suspicious.

132
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:47.395
Yeah, he sure looks like a criminal.

133
00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:53.095
You're under arrest!

134
00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:55.795
-Hey, you guys! -You're not getting away!

135
00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:57.495
Let go of me!

136
00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:58.695
-What are you doing? -You won't get away!

137
00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:00.395
Both of you, get off of him!

138
00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:02.595
I'll out him to sleep right now.

139
00:08:05.595 --> 00:08:08.895
Officer Takagi?

140
00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:12.795
Gosh. If you're an officer, dress like an officer, will you?

141
00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:14.295
That's right!

142
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:17.795
I can't help it, because my wireless broke on me.

143
00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:19.495
What? Your wireless broke?

144
00:08:19.495 --> 00:08:22.995
Yeah. Only mine wasn't doing too good.

145
00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:25.495
Thinking that using a cellular phone might confuse everybody,

146
00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:26.595
I was keeping contact with the Inspector

147
00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.895
with an earphone microphone.

148
00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:31.495
And where's the partner of the criminal?

149
00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:32.895
He seems to have left the stadium from the main gate

150
00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:35.295
with the cash because...

151
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:37.695
The criminal threatened us saying,

152
00:08:37.695 --> 00:08:40.395
"I'll kill someone from the audience if you go after him."

153
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:43.195
Is he the only one who left the stadium?

154
00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:44.595
Yeah, he's the only one.

155
00:08:44.595 --> 00:08:46.895
Nobody else left.

156
00:08:46.895 --> 00:08:50.795
Which means that the bad guys are still here in this stadium?

157
00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:54.095
We've still got a chance of capturing him.

158
00:08:54.095 --> 00:08:56.995
But what a greedy criminal

159
00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.995
to demand double the first amount.

160
00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:04.495
No, I don't think he's after money this time.

161
00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:08.795
Because it's impossible to get 10 billion yen ready in 45 minutes.

162
00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:10.495
Then, why?

163
00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:13.395
The criminal is planning to shoot somebody to begin with.

164
00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:14.695
What?

165
00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:17.595
He'll do so at the time the end of the game whistle is blown.

166
00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:30.495
Officer Takagi, how far has the game be played already?

167
00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:31.795
It's exactly 15 minutes

168
00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:34.095
after the 2nd half of the game has started.

169
00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:36.595
Which means there is only 30 minutes to go

170
00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:38.695
till the end of the game.

171
00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:42.295
Put 10 billion yen in the bag

172
00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:45.695
and place it at the same exit of gate 18.

173
00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:47.995
If it's not ready by that time,

174
00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:50.995
I'm killing somebody in the audience.

175
00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:52.495
I'm sure you're aware

176
00:09:52.495 --> 00:09:55.895
that I'm holding 56,000 people hostage.

177
00:09:57.395 --> 00:09:58.695
Gosh.

178
00:09:58.695 --> 00:10:00.495
Inspector!

179
00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:01.895
Inspector Megure.

180
00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:03.295
We've lost track of the car

181
00:10:03.295 --> 00:10:05.595
of the criminal who fled with the cash.

182
00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:07.495
-What? -I'm sorry.

183
00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:09.395
We were threatened not to pursue the car,

184
00:10:09.395 --> 00:10:12.095
so we're trying to be inconspicuous.

185
00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:14.995
We got the license plate number, though.

186
00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:16.795
But it turned out to be a stolen car.

187
00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:19.895
We've got no choice

188
00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:24.095
but to nab the one who is still within this stadium, then.

189
00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:27.995
One? You mean there are two blackmailers?

190
00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:29.495
The criminal said things like

191
00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:32.995
"my partner" and "my share" in his conversation.

192
00:10:32.995 --> 00:10:35.495
Which means that it is highly probable

193
00:10:35.495 --> 00:10:37.495
that there are only two of them.

194
00:10:37.495 --> 00:10:39.795
Furthermore, he remarked on the position

195
00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:43.395
of all the officers throughout the stadium.

196
00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:48.695
I'm sure that he is still hiding somewhere in this stadium.

197
00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:51.195
But, how should we find him?

198
00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:53.795
After all, the officers have all withdrawn

199
00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:57.195
from the stands by demand of the criminal.

200
00:10:57.195 --> 00:10:59.395
That's what I'm trying to figure out now!

201
00:10:59.395 --> 00:11:01.895
Why don't you check through the video?

202
00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.695
When you got the phone call,

203
00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:07.295
a video that was not in use was scanning the audience, right?

204
00:11:07.295 --> 00:11:09.695
If so, a shot of the criminal may be on the video.

205
00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:12.595
A strange man looking through the stadium with binoculars

206
00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:14.195
while talking on the phone.

207
00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:15.895
I see.

208
00:11:15.895 --> 00:11:18.095
Can we see that video right away?

209
00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:19.395
Yes.

210
00:11:30.595 --> 00:11:31.995
Inspector.

211
00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:34.095
There seems to be no such suspicious person

212
00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:36.595
in the stands up front or the back stand.

213
00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:38.395
It can't be!

214
00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:41.195
Did you check the press that came into the stadium?

215
00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:43.295
If the cameras are equipped with zoom lenses,

216
00:11:43.295 --> 00:11:45.795
they can see quite a distance.

217
00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:48.195
I was watching over the stands where the camera men were,

218
00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:50.395
but there were no suspicious looking persons.

219
00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:52.495
Besides, if there was somebody on the phone looking through

220
00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:54.895
the view finder of a camera and talking on the phone as well,

221
00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:56.895
he would attract attention.

222
00:11:56.895 --> 00:11:58.695
Right.

223
00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:03.195
Ridiculous!

224
00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:05.995
Then how on earth did the criminal talk on the phone

225
00:12:05.995 --> 00:12:09.095
as well as look around the stadium at the same time?

226
00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:13.095
How could he do it without anyone noticing him?

227
00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:26.584
Inspector.

228
00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:30.484
I got together a little over a billion yen for now.

229
00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:34.084
It's impossible to get together an amount cash down like 10 billion.

230
00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:35.684
We've got no choice.

231
00:12:35.684 --> 00:12:38.384
We'll just use newspaper or something to fill up whatever is missing

232
00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:40.184
and wait to see what the criminal will do.

233
00:12:40.184 --> 00:12:42.684
Inspector.

234
00:12:42.684 --> 00:12:44.484
What is it, Officer Takagi?

235
00:12:44.484 --> 00:12:48.584
Maybe the criminal is not after money this time.

236
00:12:48.584 --> 00:12:49.584
What?

237
00:12:49.584 --> 00:12:52.684
It's obvious to anybody that no matter how you run around the banks,

238
00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:55.384
it would be impossible to gather 10 billion yen

239
00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:57.384
in a matter of 45 minutes.

240
00:12:57.384 --> 00:12:59.984
Therefore, all the criminal wants is

241
00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:03.084
the 50,000,000 yen that he first demanded.

242
00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:05.684
Hey, don't tell me...

243
00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:08.784
That the criminal was planning to shoot somebody

244
00:13:08.784 --> 00:13:11.184
as soon as the game ended to begin with.

245
00:13:11.184 --> 00:13:14.084
No way! Why?

246
00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:16.084
Maybe something happened at Nichiuri TV recently

247
00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:19.384
that someone held a grudge against?

248
00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:21.384
No, I can't recall any such thing.

249
00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.984
Hey, mister.

250
00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:25.684
Was the voice of the criminal that called you

251
00:13:25.684 --> 00:13:28.084
all of the same person?

252
00:13:28.084 --> 00:13:31.484
Yeah. The voices of all three calls were muffled,

253
00:13:31.484 --> 00:13:33.784
but I think they were of the same man.

254
00:13:33.784 --> 00:13:36.484
Which means that the person who called

255
00:13:36.484 --> 00:13:39.184
and the person who shot the ball are two different people,

256
00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:40.884
so the man who came to get the money

257
00:13:40.884 --> 00:13:43.384
is the one who shot the ball, right?

258
00:13:43.384 --> 00:13:44.584
Yeah.

259
00:13:44.584 --> 00:13:47.084
The other guy's voice was heard from the phone

260
00:13:47.084 --> 00:13:49.384
that the guy who came to get the cash was holding, so...

261
00:13:49.384 --> 00:13:51.684
But the guy who came to get the cash

262
00:13:51.684 --> 00:13:53.684
didn't have a gun on him, did he?

263
00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:55.784
I wonder why?

264
00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:59.984
He gave his gun to his partner?

265
00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:03.184
Okay, check all the videos between the 35 minutes,

266
00:14:03.184 --> 00:14:06.484
10 minutes past the first half of the game when the ball was shot,

267
00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:08.484
to loss time when he came to get the cash again.

268
00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:09.984
Find the guy in the audience

269
00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:12.684
that the man who came to get the cash had contact with.

270
00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:14.584
He's the criminal that's left in the stadium!

271
00:14:14.584 --> 00:14:15.684
Yes, sir!

272
00:14:19.584 --> 00:14:21.684
Goal!

273
00:14:21.684 --> 00:14:22.984
37 minutes past the 2nd half of the game,

274
00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:24.984
Ramus's volley shot makes goal!

275
00:14:24.984 --> 00:14:27.684
The score is a turn over of 2-1, with the Big's in the lead!

276
00:14:29.884 --> 00:14:31.384
There he is, Inspector!

277
00:14:31.384 --> 00:14:33.684
That guy is on the video!

278
00:14:33.684 --> 00:14:36.584
Did he give something to someone?

279
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.884
No. He was just walking along the aisle.

280
00:14:39.884 --> 00:14:42.984
Gosh. He's out of vision of the monitor.

281
00:14:42.984 --> 00:14:45.784
Don't give up! We still have time.

282
00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:49.084
As long as there's a possibility, keep searching!

283
00:14:49.084 --> 00:14:51.984
It is very unlikely that he is on the video.

284
00:14:51.984 --> 00:14:54.284
Moreover, it's not definite

285
00:14:54.284 --> 00:14:56.084
whether he actually gave the gun to anyone.

286
00:14:56.084 --> 00:15:02.184
But this is the only way we have left to look for the criminal.

287
00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:05.084
This is the only method we have left!

288
00:15:14.484 --> 00:15:17.184
It's almost loss time.

289
00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:19.184
Shut up! I know.

290
00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.184
Gosh, there's not much time left!

291
00:15:21.184 --> 00:15:23.584
Where is he? Where, where?

292
00:15:23.584 --> 00:15:24.984
Where the heck is he?

293
00:15:35.284 --> 00:15:36.384
Please...

294
00:15:37.484 --> 00:15:38.984
Please, the time...

295
00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:42.684
Please stop.

296
00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:44.484
Cool it.

297
00:15:46.084 --> 00:15:49.684
We can't control time, can we?

298
00:15:49.684 --> 00:15:53.084
If we try to control it by force,

299
00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:55.184
we'll have to pay the toll.

300
00:15:56.384 --> 00:15:58.384
What're you talking about?

301
00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:03.884
That was close!

302
00:16:03.884 --> 00:16:06.384
It's already the 3rd time!

303
00:16:06.384 --> 00:16:09.384
This is no time to be getting excited watching the game.

304
00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:10.684
No, that's not it.

305
00:16:10.684 --> 00:16:12.884
We were also looking for the suspicious person

306
00:16:12.884 --> 00:16:15.084
that you were also looking for.

307
00:16:15.084 --> 00:16:19.084
That suspicious man always disappears from scene!

308
00:16:19.084 --> 00:16:20.584
Disappears?

309
00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:23.584
See, the minute he is seen to the edge at left,

310
00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:26.084
the camera moves and he goes off scene.

311
00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:28.884
This is camera 13, isn't it?

312
00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:30.684
How unlucky.

313
00:16:30.684 --> 00:16:32.184
See?

314
00:16:32.184 --> 00:16:34.084
Come to think of it, even a while ago...

315
00:16:37.284 --> 00:16:39.984
I get it.

316
00:16:39.984 --> 00:16:42.584
So, that's what it was.

317
00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:45.984
Inspector, it's loss time.

318
00:16:45.984 --> 00:16:47.284
It can't be helped.

319
00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:51.584
Put a camouflage bag at gate 18, and watch it.

320
00:16:51.584 --> 00:16:53.784
The rest of you, charge into the stands

321
00:16:53.784 --> 00:16:56.084
as soon as the game ends! Hurry!

322
00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:57.284
Yes, sir...

323
00:17:00.784 --> 00:17:03.384
Huh? Where's Conan?

324
00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:08.884
Go, Hide!

325
00:17:25.184 --> 00:17:27.784
I've finally figured it out, mister.

326
00:17:29.984 --> 00:17:34.484
You're the one who threatened Nichiuri TV, right?

327
00:17:37.284 --> 00:17:39.684
It wouldn't look strange even if you were to be looking

328
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.384
through the audience with the camera.

329
00:17:42.384 --> 00:17:44.884
And you wouldn't look suspicious

330
00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:47.084
even if you were to be talking into the microphone

331
00:17:47.084 --> 00:17:48.584
that is attached to your earphone.

332
00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:51.484
Besides, nobody would imagine that

333
00:17:51.484 --> 00:17:53.984
a camera man from the same TV station

334
00:17:53.984 --> 00:17:56.784
is threatening his colleague.

335
00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:59.784
Good work, kid.

336
00:17:59.784 --> 00:18:03.684
I saw the video that you shot, mister.

337
00:18:03.684 --> 00:18:06.984
The partner of the criminal entered the scene 3 times,

338
00:18:06.984 --> 00:18:10.284
but all three times, he framed out right away.

339
00:18:10.284 --> 00:18:12.284
And that's when I figured it out.

340
00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:14.584
That it wasn't that he was coincidentally not in the video,

341
00:18:14.584 --> 00:18:16.684
but that his partner had deliberately set it up to be so,

342
00:18:16.684 --> 00:18:18.684
in order to protect him.

343
00:18:18.684 --> 00:18:22.884
And the position of the officers that the criminal had pointed out

344
00:18:22.884 --> 00:18:25.384
were all in the center stand.

345
00:18:25.384 --> 00:18:27.484
The only camera that can take those shots

346
00:18:27.484 --> 00:18:31.884
is the one that is situated by the back stand.

347
00:18:31.884 --> 00:18:37.184
You're the only one who meets all the requirements to do so.

348
00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:41.384
What are you going to do?

349
00:18:41.384 --> 00:18:43.484
Will you turn yourself in?

350
00:18:43.484 --> 00:18:45.584
Mister?

351
00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:48.484
Yeah, I have no choice.

352
00:18:48.484 --> 00:18:50.084
I'll do that.

353
00:18:53.084 --> 00:18:55.984
Shoots!

354
00:18:55.984 --> 00:19:00.284
What I'd actually like to say, but I can't do that.

355
00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:04.084
I've got my reasons, you see.

356
00:19:04.084 --> 00:19:05.384
Beretta.

357
00:19:05.384 --> 00:19:07.084
That's not a Tocaref.

358
00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:09.084
Yeah, my partner's gun

359
00:19:09.084 --> 00:19:12.384
is in one of the trash cans inside the stadium.

360
00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:15.584
The Baretta and Tocaref are all guns we got together

361
00:19:15.584 --> 00:19:18.684
for the bank robbery a year ago.

362
00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:21.584
The plan that we schemed and invested all the money

363
00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:24.984
that we saved up for 3 years for, was perfect.

364
00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:27.184
On the day we were to carry out the robbery,

365
00:19:27.184 --> 00:19:29.284
a stupid event of some show biz talent

366
00:19:29.284 --> 00:19:30.784
serving as one day branch manager was being held.

367
00:19:30.784 --> 00:19:33.484
And it got crowded.

368
00:19:33.484 --> 00:19:38.184
My woman who was expecting that money,

369
00:19:38.184 --> 00:19:40.984
drowned herself in alcohol and committed suicide.

370
00:19:40.984 --> 00:19:46.084
Thanks to the stupid event that Nichiuri TV had put on.

371
00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:47.784
I see.

372
00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:49.784
So, you became a camera man for Nichiuri TV

373
00:19:49.784 --> 00:19:54.084
so that you could take revenge.

374
00:19:54.084 --> 00:19:56.284
But, what do you plan to do?

375
00:19:56.284 --> 00:19:58.284
If you shoot me now,

376
00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:01.184
I'm sure someone will notice, right?

377
00:20:01.184 --> 00:20:03.284
Nobody will realize a thing.

378
00:20:03.284 --> 00:20:07.684
Look, the eyes of the audience are glued to the game.

379
00:20:07.684 --> 00:20:10.484
With the cheer of the crowd and this silencer attached gun,

380
00:20:10.484 --> 00:20:13.484
not a sound will be heard.

381
00:20:13.484 --> 00:20:16.584
Nobody has even noticed that

382
00:20:16.584 --> 00:20:19.384
you're down here in the field, either.

383
00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:22.784
I'm shooting you the instant the game ends.

384
00:20:22.784 --> 00:20:25.784
The cheers will turn into screams and there will be panic.

385
00:20:25.784 --> 00:20:28.884
I'm going to flee in the midst of the commotion

386
00:20:28.884 --> 00:20:32.284
and inform the papers that

387
00:20:32.284 --> 00:20:39.284
"I killed a kid because Nichiuri TV refused to pay ransom!"

388
00:20:47.384 --> 00:20:48.484
What the...

389
00:21:01.084 --> 00:21:03.784
The game is over! The score is 2-1!

390
00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:07.184
Big Osaka has won the Emperor's Cup game!

391
00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:08.784
The man of the match, of course is Ramus Rivero

392
00:21:08.784 --> 00:21:11.984
who showed great offensive as well as defensive play!

393
00:21:11.984 --> 00:21:13.784
The defensive iron wall play that he displayed

394
00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:15.784
towards the end of the game was fantastic!

395
00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:18.184
Ramus!

396
00:21:18.184 --> 00:21:20.184
Nice clear!

397
00:21:23.084 --> 00:21:26.584
The criminal was arrested by the officers

398
00:21:26.584 --> 00:21:28.784
who charged in at the end of the game.

399
00:21:28.784 --> 00:21:30.184
30 minutes later,

400
00:21:30.184 --> 00:21:33.484
his partner who was found at his apartment was also arrested.

401
00:21:33.484 --> 00:21:34.684
The Emperor's Cup Game

402
00:21:34.684 --> 00:21:38.084
ended as if nothing had happened at all.

403
00:23:15.284 --> 00:23:18.584
Shoots. I wanted to have a closer look at the game.

404
00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:20.184
The criminal was arrested

405
00:23:20.184 --> 00:23:21.384
before we realized what was happening.

406
00:23:21.384 --> 00:23:22.884
The Youth Detective Squad

407
00:23:22.884 --> 00:23:24.984
didn't do anything worth noticing today.

408
00:23:24.984 --> 00:23:27.384
Not really. The Inspector was saying that

409
00:23:27.384 --> 00:23:31.284
you helped out in the arrest of the criminal too.

410
00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:33.184
Really?

411
00:23:34.484 --> 00:23:37.284
You're really something, Shinichi,

412
00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:41.984
to be able to track down the criminal with so little of a clue.

413
00:23:41.984 --> 00:23:46.284
You're becoming an even more attractive research material for me.

414
00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:49.184
I don't need know 84 years old granny telling me that.

415
00:23:49.184 --> 00:23:52.184
Oh, I'm actually...

416
00:23:52.184 --> 00:23:54.884
18 years old, a perfect match for you.

417
00:23:54.884 --> 00:23:57.084
What?

418
00:23:57.084 --> 00:23:58.784
Maybe.

419
00:24:03.384 --> 00:24:06.284
"Next Episode"

420
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.184
Call the police, Pops.

421
00:24:16.484 --> 00:24:18.684
Ran, I'll be right there!

422
00:24:22.684 --> 00:24:24.884
Ran!

423
00:24:24.884 --> 00:24:27.284
Ran, run for it.

424
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:29.484
Next Conan,

425
00:24:29.484 --> 00:24:33.305
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 1)"

426
00:24:33.986 --> 00:24:36.186
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:38.686
"Handle name"

428
00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:40.486
We'll be challenging a crime thought to be impossible in the next episode.

429
00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:42.686
Try and solve it before Conan does, okay?
