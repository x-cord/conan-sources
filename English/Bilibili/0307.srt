1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,740
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,840
This case may lead us to those in black.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,940
They may be involved in this case.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,667
Excuse me, Detective Mouri!

9
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,067
I'd like to ask you about the recent homicide case.

10
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,567
It is said that Mr. Nagumo who was arrested

11
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:47,367
confessed that he committed the murder

12
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:51,667
because Nobuharu was being bullied by Mr. Kazami.

13
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,067
If that's what he's saying, so it is.

14
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,767
All I did was expose the trick that he used

15
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,867
and advised him that it would be wiser to turn himself in

16
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,667
before any evidence came up.

17
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,067
If you will excuse me, then...

18
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,467
Mr. Mouri...

19
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:10,067
-Please wait! -Just another word, please.

20
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,967
A man says few but the message is still there.

21
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,367
I'm so cool!

22
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,767
Ghads, when he rarely solves the case without goofing,

23
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,567
he gets all carried away.

24
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:28,467
Well, I guess I can't help making Pops play detective

25
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,167
because I got to get information on the men in black.

26
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,267
But, they sure don't show up.

27
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,667
Rewind, rewind.

28
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:40,667
They collect large sums of cash by repeating assassinations.

29
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,367
They force people like Ai to make drugs,

30
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:47,567
and go around gathering competent computer programmers.

31
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:52,667
Just what... what are they after?

32
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,267
Hello, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

33
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,167
Don't tell me that they're planning

34
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,567
to create an incredible game using all that cash.

35
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,667
What? A game?

36
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:10,667
The whereabouts of a system engineer who makes games is unknown.

37
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,167
Yes.

38
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,667
And you'd like us to find him for you.

39
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,667
Hey, tell him I'm not in.

40
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,667
I have to record the re-run of Yoko's drama

41
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,267
cutting all the commercials, you see.

42
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,567
Yes, now it'll be just fine!

43
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,267
My dad's got a lot of free time today.

44
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,667
Hey.

45
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,267
Come on, hurry shave and fix your necktie.

46
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:33,967
Yes.

47
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:37,867
The whereabouts of a game system engineer is unknown?

48
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,967
Don't tell me that...

49
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,367
Could it be...

50
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:51,667
"The Remains of Voiceless Testimony (Part 1)"

51
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:59,867
So he's the system engineer that disappeared about a week ago.

52
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,967
And you say this is not the first time he disappeared like this.

53
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:05,267
What do you mean?

54
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,967
Well, each time the deadline for the game system

55
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,667
that he is ordered to do closes in,

56
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,867
he frequently disappears.

57
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,667
Well, we thought it's the usual this time, too.

58
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:18,467
But we can't afford to just wait with our fingers in our mouths either.

59
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,967
We asked the police to ask him previously

60
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,667
and he really bawled us out,

61
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,867
so this time we decided to ask you instead.

62
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,467
I see.

63
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,167
They don't seem to have anything to do with the guys I'm looking for.

64
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:34,767
So, if you do find him, please contact me...

65
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,067
Hey, you must be kidding!

66
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,567
My place is dishing out the most cash!

67
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,767
Hey! Our company's the one

68
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,567
that first ordered the system to him this time!

69
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:48,267
You're not of the same company?

70
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,067
"Katsumichi Sugai (39)" -I'm Sugai, the one who ordered him

71
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:53,267
to make the system for the Igo software this time.

72
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,067
"Jouhei Naito (47)" -I'm Naito,

73
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,267
and asked him to make a chess software.

74
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:00,067
"Ryusuke Soma (44)" -I asked him to make a shogi software.

75
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,767
My name's Soma.

76
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,567
But, is it possible for one person

77
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,967
to handle making three different kinds of game software at once?

78
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,167
That's why we want to find him and complain!

79
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,067
That things are not how we thought they were!

80
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,767
We all went to place our order to him separately,

81
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,467
and this is what he told each of us,

82
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,467
"I haven't signed a contract with anyone this time

83
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,067
so leave it to me".

84
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,567
When did you find out that he was taking work

85
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,467
from all of you at the same time?

86
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:27,667
A week ago, we all received this e-mail from him.

87
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:32,467
Taking on three jobs at the same time sure is tiring.

88
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,067
Well, since my heart seems to be doing pretty good recently,

89
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,767
I think I'll leave my office for a while

90
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,967
and take my time working on my orders.

91
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,067
-This man... -So, please be patient until I'm finished.

92
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,267
I didn't notice because he was wearing glasses in the picture,

93
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:47,767
but isn't he Mr. Taku Itakura, who is famous for computer graphics?

94
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:52,067
Yes, he wears contacts when he appears in public.

95
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,367
Do you know him?

96
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:57,867
Yes, he comes out a lot in the credit of the movies.

97
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,267
Ever since his eyesight got bad about 3 years ago,

98
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,167
he left the field of computer graphics

99
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,067
and now concentrates on developing systems.

100
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:10,267
If he's that famous, he could've been kidnapped.

101
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,667
No way.

102
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:15,267
Rather with that guy, anything is possible.

103
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,367
About 2 years ago,

104
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,967
I saw a guy with a mustache at Mr. Itakura's office.

105
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:23,967
He was a big man with a Kansai accent.

106
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,767
I'm sure you've seen him, too.

107
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:31,767
He was at the Mantendo game convention.

108
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,267
Tequila!

109
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,967
What did the big man say?

110
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,467
What were they talking about at the office?

111
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,367
I don't know.

112
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:47,867
When I got there, he was saying, "We don't need you no more",

113
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,767
and he was ready to leave.

114
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,367
Is that all? Isn't there more?

115
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,867
Hey, Conan. Just what's the matter with you?

116
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:56,167
Darn.

117
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:00,267
I've no choice but to find Mr. Itakura and ask him myself.

118
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,067
If I'm not mistaken,

119
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,467
that big man supposedly died in the explosion back then,

120
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,867
so I don't think he's involved.

121
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,767
The problem is this picture.

122
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:10,167
How shall we start searching for him?

123
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,267
I think he's in a hotel or something somewhere.

124
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:17,267
Hotel's refuse to give out private information of their guests, too.

125
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,767
Besides, he's probably using a pseudonym anyway.

126
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,867
Ran.

127
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:28,367
I want to eat sashimi, Tientsin food and beef stew tonight.

128
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:31,667
Hey, wait second. That's Japanese, Chinese and Western-style food.

129
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,967
You can't even get that combination of food

130
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,567
at a family restaurant that's got almost all kinds of food.

131
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,067
Which means if one customer orders all three kinds of food by himself,

132
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,867
people will think he's a weird customer, right?

133
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,467
A weird customer?

134
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,467
Come to think of it, he has a shogi board,

135
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:49,067
an Igo board and a chessboard in his room.

136
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:52,767
Have you heard what he took with him from his workplace?

137
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,567
I heard that he packed the notebook type computer

138
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:58,467
that he always uses, and a few discs in his bag and left.

139
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,567
He didn't take anything else with him, then?

140
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,567
Yes.

141
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,367
What is with this hotel?

142
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,367
Who may I ask are you?

143
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,867
I'm the one who borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo game from you.

144
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,867
The phone in my room is suddenly not working.

145
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,967
I'm calling from my cell phone now,

146
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,467
hurry and do something about it!

147
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:22,267
We do not rent out things like that in our hotel.

148
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,967
Oh, I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

149
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,467
Okay, next it's Hotel New Baker.

150
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,767
If a guest borrows shogi, chess, and Igo board all by himself

151
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:37,067
and stays at the hotel for a week,

152
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,767
I'm sure the employees of the hotel are talking about him.

153
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,167
I'm calling on my cell phone right now,

154
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,367
but hurry and do something, will you?

155
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,667
You're Mr. Itakura of room 2004, aren't you?

156
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,067
Right, room 2004.

157
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,567
I'll send somebody over to your room right away, sir.

158
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,667
The telephone cord seems to have unhooked!

159
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,767
I'm so sorry.

160
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:04,167
Hotel New Baker, room 2004!

161
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:09,167
Ghads, why are you guys coming with me?

162
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,067
You're nothing but trouble!

163
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,967
Because Conan said...

164
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,467
It's not fair, Pops.

165
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:18,467
I know you're planning to eat at the luxurious hotel restaurant.

166
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,867
No big deal, Mr. Detective.

167
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:25,667
If Mr. Itakura is found, we'll treat you to a meal.

168
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,667
Oh, well.

169
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:35,567
So this is his hide-out.

170
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:39,067
You're all competitors in the business, aren't you?

171
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:42,367
Why'd you all end up coming here together?

172
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:46,867
Because we found out that he took jobs from all three of us at once.

173
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,067
All of us who are in charge of the job we ordered to him

174
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,467
decided that we three should talk to him together.

175
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:54,367
And so, it dawned on me to ask you to help us, Mr. Mouri.

176
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:58,167
I was the one, who suggested that we ask a detective to help us!

177
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,167
No, I'm the one who mentioned his name.

178
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,767
Idiot! I'm the one who contacted him by phone.

179
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,567
I'm the one who first mentioned the idea, right?

180
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,967
Gosh.

181
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:11,567
Man, Yoko's program is over.

182
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,067
Oh, my. Wearing a cheap wristwatch like that,

183
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,767
I'm sure you'll get some snide remarks about it.

184
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,167
Mr. Itakura is really picky when it comes to watches.

185
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,267
-Look, that's why... -We also...

186
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,867
Is your wristwatch genuine or what?

187
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,667
You jerk! I just bought it 5 days ago, it's brand new.

188
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,567
I'll bet yours is fake.

189
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:42,667
I'm sorry. Mr. Naito, can you push the 20th floor for me, please?

190
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,867
Sure.

191
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,467
Let's see.

192
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,667
I'm sure that Mr. Itakura will be surprised seeing us all here.

193
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,767
Yes.

194
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:00,667
I wonder if it's okay to head for the hotel room just like that?

195
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,567
Mr. Itakura is a man who is somehow

196
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:05,067
involved with Tequila, a member of the organization.

197
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,467
I wonder if it's safe for Ran, Pops and those people

198
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,367
to go to his room?

199
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:16,567
Those last words that Tequila said to Mr. Itakura,

200
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,467
"You're of no use to us anymore".

201
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,467
In other words,

202
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:22,867
it could mean, "We're finished with you, so we're going to kill you".

203
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,867
What if those guys are hiding near here

204
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,667
to get rid of Mr. Itakura.

205
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:30,667
Rather, they may already be in his room.

206
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,667
Come on, idiot. What am I getting all panicky for?

207
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,267
Cool head.

208
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:40,167
Tequila said so 2 years ago.

209
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,867
If they really meant to kill him,

210
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,667
Mr. Itakura would've been killed long ago.

211
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:48,467
Besides, if Mr. Itakura is a member of the organization,

212
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:52,067
he would never let an outsider such as Mr. Soma, enter the room

213
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,567
while he is talking to Tequila.

214
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,567
At any rate, we've got to meet Mr. Itakura

215
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,267
and get him to somehow tell us what's going on.

216
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:07,067
I've got to find out why Tequila came to his office.

217
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,867
Strange.

218
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,967
He's got this "Don't Disturb" sign hanging on the door and yet...

219
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,467
He probably went out to eat or something.

220
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,267
Let's wait in front of here, then.

221
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:30,467
Thank you so much for the trouble.

222
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,567
It's an automatic lock door,

223
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,967
so please make sure you take your key along with you.

224
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,467
Yes, I will.

225
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,567
Excuse me, mister!

226
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,467
Could you open my uncle's room, too?

227
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:50,067
It seems he forgot that we were coming and went out.

228
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,267
But...

229
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:54,267
Hurry! Or I'm going to leak.

230
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,167
I gotta go...

231
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,267
I'm really sorry, thank you.

232
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,367
You're pretty sharp, sonny.

233
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:10,067
Because if Mr. Itakura comes back

234
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,967
and sees us all in front of the door of his room,

235
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,167
he might run away, right?

236
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,767
But that's no need for that, sonny.

237
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:22,067
It seems that Mr. Itakura has just dozed off.

238
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,567
Of all things I tell you...

239
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,967
Hey, get up. Hey.

240
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,567
You can't get away, Mr. Itakura.

241
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,167
What?

242
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,289
Mr. Itakura!

243
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,189
Mr. Itakura?

244
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:50,889
No good.

245
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:53,789
He's been dead for more than a day.

246
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:56,089
What? It can't be...

247
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:57,989
I'll go call the police.

248
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:01,189
What happened?

249
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,989
Probably a heart attack.

250
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:06,789
Pills are scattered all over the desk.

251
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,989
He probably had a sudden heart attack

252
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:10,789
and tried to drink medicine,

253
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,289
but couldn't, and died.

254
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,489
I tell you. It's because he goes into hiding.

255
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:26,189
No, Mr. Itakura didn't die of an illness.

256
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,289
He was killed by someone.

257
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,089
But, why?

258
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,189
Why did all clues of those guys vanish just like that?

259
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:38,989
Darn!

260
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,989
What's that?

261
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,289
A diary?

262
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:48,089
Mr. Itakura's diary.

263
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:52,289
If so, maybe there's something in it.

264
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,589
About what Tequila came to visit Mr. Itakura for...

265
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:02,889
and what the men in black are trying to do.

266
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,089
Maybe looking through this

267
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,589
will give us an idea.

268
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:07,589
Hey!

269
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,889
Don't you dare touch the belongings of a dead person!

270
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,789
Seriously. The minute I take my eyes off of you...

271
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,289
Darn. I can't do a thing about it after all.

272
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,689
I guess I'll have to let him know what's going on

273
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,289
to look inside the diary.

274
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,289
About the fact that Mr. Itakura

275
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,789
didn't die a natural death by a heart attack,

276
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:30,889
but was made to look that way by someone.

277
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,989
And that the possibility of that someone being one of the three here is,

278
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,589
is very likely.

279
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,389
The victim is Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45,

280
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,089
a system engineer of games.

281
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,989
And, the cause of his death is?

282
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,089
I can't say anything decisive

283
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,289
but there are no visible external injuries.

284
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,889
Judging from the fact

285
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,189
that he was taking doses of a coronary enlargement drug,

286
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:01,189
it is likely that he had a heart attack.

287
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:04,189
He's probably been dead for about 2 days.

288
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:07,789
Inspector! We got a hold of Mr. Itakura's doctor.

289
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:08,989
And?

290
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:12,289
Mr. Itakura's heart seems to have been in very bad shape,

291
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,189
and he was scheduled to undergo surgery

292
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:17,189
as soon as he completed the work he had taken on this time.

293
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,689
Which means,

294
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:21,589
this case is not one that's to be handled by you.

295
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,289
Yes, it sure looks to be that way.

296
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:28,189
But, if he's been dead for two days,

297
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,989
why didn't any of the hotel personnel realize it?

298
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:35,489
He used to hate people coming into his working place.

299
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,489
Yes, that's right. Just the other day,

300
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,789
he was fuming about the fact that the papers on his desk

301
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,589
had been moved 10 centimeters.

302
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:45,289
And, he rarely changes the sheets he uses at home either,

303
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:48,189
so I'm sure he refused to have his bed made.

304
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,589
Who are those three people?

305
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:55,189
They are employees of the companies that placed jobs to Mr. Itakura.

306
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,189
They came to ask me

307
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:01,789
to search for Mr. Itakura who disappeared a week ago.

308
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:07,089
And, you found him all right, but he was dead?

309
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,689
Yes.

310
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,789
But it's no wonder that he ended up this way,

311
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,989
being that he confined himself in a hotel, neglecting his health.

312
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,689
I see.

313
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,489
I think this man favors tidiness.

314
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,489
Because when we came into this room,

315
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:28,189
this man was sitting on the chair with his face pushed down on the desk,

316
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:31,489
and yet there are no marks left on the desk.

317
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:34,489
Marks?

318
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,589
The marks of his saliva.

319
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,789
If somebody drools as much as he does,

320
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:40,789
it would usually dirty the desk too, wouldn't it?

321
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,089
I'm sure the man wiped it.

322
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,389
Idiot!

323
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,789
Why would a man who is suffering from a heart attack

324
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,489
wipe the desk before drinking his medicine?

325
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,489
Then, who wiped the desk?

326
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,789
I wonder who can it be?

327
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,289
Besides, this is the first time that I heard that the victim

328
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,989
was found with his face down on the desk.

329
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:02,489
Oh, well. He slid to the floor when we shook him...

330
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:04,789
If so, then it's strange.

331
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,989
The back of the victim's hand.

332
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,389
If the hand of the victim whose face was down on the desk

333
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,189
was found stiff in this position, his hand would've had to be

334
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:17,389
stuck between the desk and his body all this time.

335
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,489
But there are no such traces left.

336
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:24,289
Don't tell me that Mr. Itakura died somewhere else?

337
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:27,389
But the hands and feet of the corpse

338
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:31,589
is completely stiff in this manner, inspector.

339
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,789
If so, it would be impossible

340
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:37,789
unless someone tied Mr. Itakura onto the chair deliberately.

341
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,689
I see.

342
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,689
So Mr. Itakura was probably made to sit in the chair,

343
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:48,589
tied up with his hands on his chest,

344
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,689
and was unable to take his medicine unless somebody helped him drink it.

345
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,989
Then, don't tell me that this is...

346
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:58,989
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

347
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,989
A homicide.

348
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:04,989
Oh, no.

349
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:09,889
But if so, there should be marks of him having been tied up.

350
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,889
How about it, coroner?

351
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:15,189
There are no such clear traces,

352
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,889
but it seems that exterior pressure

353
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,489
had been applied to a wide area over his body,

354
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:21,489
from the many visible traces of blood congestion.

355
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:23,289
Just what does that mean?

356
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:26,989
This blanket is soft and warm!

357
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:29,689
Conan! Stop that.

358
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,189
But, what's this?

359
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:34,489
It's got sticky stuff on here and there!

360
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:38,089
I get it. It's the blanket.

361
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,489
The blanket?

362
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:44,789
The killer probably wrapped Mr. Itakura's body with the blanket,

363
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,589
made him sit in the chair and then wrapped his body up with masking tape.

364
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,689
A pillow or something was probably placed in between his lap and chest,

365
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:54,989
to make him lean against the desk.

366
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:58,689
I see. If so, there would be no traces.

367
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:01,289
Which means that the legs of this table that are fixed in place

368
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:04,389
is what held his chair in place.

369
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,489
Although it looks as if they removed it once,

370
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:10,089
a little of the adhesive of the masking tape can still be detected.

371
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:15,689
In other words, the killer left Mr. Itakura in that position

372
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,289
until he died of a heart attack.

373
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:21,089
Then after postmortem rigidity spread throughout his body,

374
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,989
they came back again to remove the masking tape and blanket.

375
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,189
That is, they made it look like he died of an illness.

376
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,189
Okay.

377
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,689
Ask the hotel employees if they saw any suspicious-looking people

378
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,689
during the last three days.

379
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:34,989
Yes, sir!

380
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,189
A hotel...

381
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,989
Well, the thing is, I called this hotel making believe

382
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,989
that I was Mr. Itakura to hunt down this room.

383
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,289
I told them that I was the one who borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo games.

384
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,589
And complained to them saying that my telephone broke down,

385
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:51,389
so to hurry and do something about it.

386
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:56,089
And that's how I got the room number to this room.

387
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,289
I heard them laughing on the other side of the line after that.

388
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:01,289
Saying, "Not again".

389
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:02,589
What?

390
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:05,889
Which means that somebody else could've done the same thing

391
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,989
to find out where he was, too?

392
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:10,189
Well, but I wonder if there would be anyone

393
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,789
who have the same sort of brains that I, Kogoro Mouri has.

394
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,589
Inspector! We found another suspicious person

395
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:18,189
who pretended to be Mr. Itakura saying that

396
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,489
the phone of his room broke down.

397
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,189
Oh, so there was someone else.

398
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,889
When the employee went to check the room later,

399
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:25,889
Mr. Itakura yelled at him

400
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,789
and chased him away saying, "I didn't call you".

401
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,089
I guess it would be safe to say

402
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,989
that the killer is the one who made the phone call.

403
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,589
But how did you know

404
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,589
that Mr. Itakura borrowed the shogi, chess and Igo game from the hotel?

405
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,589
From his mail.

406
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,489
I saw the mail with the image attachment

407
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,789
that Mr. Itakura sent to the three of them.

408
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:51,689
That is, Mr. Itakura sitting in front of a shogi, chess and Igo board.

409
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,089
I see.

410
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:55,689
In other words,

411
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,189
all three of you could've used the same method

412
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:03,489
that Mr. Mouri used to come here.

413
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,189
What?

414
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,889
Are you serious?

415
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,389
No way.

416
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,389
"Next Episode" -Mr. Itakura seems to have been

417
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,289
keeping a diary every day since 5 years ago.

418
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:51,889
Which means it's in there, I'm sure.

419
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,389
The day two years ago when Tequila came to see him

420
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:55,789
should be there.

421
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,789
Could it be...

422
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:58,989
Yes.

423
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:02,389
Mr. Itakura had written information

424
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:04,989
indicating who the killer is.

425
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:07,889
That is, his dying message.

426
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,389
Next Conan,

427
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:13,489

428
