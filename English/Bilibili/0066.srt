1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.770
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.590
Conan's logic heals hearts
dried by modern society!

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.480
Today's case is
the darkness of night.

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.090
Dark mysteries need
the light of logic!

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.140
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.390
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.060
His name?

8
00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.819
The Pitch Dark Road Murder Case.

9
00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:46.429
Wasn't that delicious, Conan-kun?

10
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.179
Yeah!

11
00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.679
Ugh! You ordered nothing
but expensive food!

12
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.899
Oh! If it isn't Mori!

13
00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:53.479
Omura! Long time, no see!

14
00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.679
Omura Jun (37)
Omura! Long time, no see!

15
00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.699
You seem as lively as ever.
Omura Jun (37)

16
00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.759
Do you remember Omura-san?

17
00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.119
Yeah! He's his college friend
that we met at the hot springs!

18
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.059
This is perfect timing, Mori.
I need to talk to you...

19
00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.309
What about?

20
00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.339
There's this strange sound
outside my apartment every night.

21
00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.799
A strange sound?

22
00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.139
It's a thump, as if something's
hitting the outside wall.

23
00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
Probably just some
kids up to no good.

24
00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:30.639
I thought so too, but there was
nobody outside when I checked,

25
00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.359
and it's been going
on for a whole week now.

26
00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.929
A whole week, huh...

27
00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:38.319
Why not look into it for him?

28
00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.469
Please, Mori.

29
00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.289
Alright! Just leave it
to the great Mori Kogoro!

30
00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.209
Thank you!

31
00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.379
Delicious!

32
00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.089
Nothing beats drinking
beer with old friends!

33
00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.599
I thought you were here
to investigate the weird sound.

34
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.679
Oh, looks like we're out of beer.

35
00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:07.599
I'll go buy some.

36
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.559
No, I'll do that!

37
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.469
Thank you!

38
00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.339
You're disturbing the neighbors!

39
00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.469
We're back!

40
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.349
Been waiting for this!

41
00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.389
What was that?

42
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.509
What happened here?

43
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.609
Hey, Ikuta. What's wrong?

44
00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.449
Ikuta! Come on, already! Ikuta!

45
00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.889
Quit playin' around!

46
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.449
Ikuta! Ikuta!

47
00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.409
He's dead!

48
00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.569
What?!

49
00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.179
Ran! Get the police!

50
00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:18.849
Right!

51
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.219
A blow to the head
with a blunt object...

52
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.879
So many cigarette butts...

53
00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.009
The victim is Ikuta
Yoshiro-san, 20 years old.

54
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.189
A 2nd-year student at Beika University.

55
00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.149
And you are?

56
00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:44.839
Kusaka. I'm a college friend of Ikuta's.
Kusaka Masami (20)

57
00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.809
Kusaka. I'm a college friend of Ikuta's.

58
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:49.259
Could you explain the
situation as you found it?

59
00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.159
Yes.

60
00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.619
Ikuta and I agreed to
meet up here at 10:00 pm.

61
00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.169
But just as I called out to him,
he suddenly collapsed...

62
00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.929
Did you notice anyone else?

63
00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:01.379
No.

64
00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.929
But it was really
too dark to see much...

65
00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.679
With that light broken,
I could barely even see Ikuta...

66
00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.509
You sure you didn't kill him?

67
00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.009
I didn't do it!

68
00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.269
Please let me through!

69
00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:19.479
Hey! Wait!

70
00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:21.559
Shimizu!

71
00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.889
Kusaka! Why did he die?!

72
00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.609
Pardon me, but who are you?

73
00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.429
Shimizu Yoichi (20)
My name's Shimizu.

74
00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:30.369
I was just drinking with Ikuta
in our friend's apartment.
Shimizu Yoichi (20)

75
00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:32.199
Where would that be?

76
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:33.869
There, on the fifth floor.

77
00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:38.309
Eh?!

78
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.509
Ikuta was murdered?!

79
00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:41.839
Whose apartment is this?

80
00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:43.509
Takeno Koji (20)
lt's mine.

81
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.839
My name's Takeno. I'm a
2nd-year student along with Ikuta.
Takeno Koji (20)

82
00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:47.719
My name's Takeno. I'm a
2nd-year student along with Ikuta.

83
00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.389
And you are?

84
00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.809
Nakamura. We're all members
of the mountain climbing club.

85
00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:58.219
Ikuta-san drank with you all here?

86
00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.639
Yes, I invited everyone over.
We've been here since 7:00...

87
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.239
Around what time
did Ikuta-san step outside?

88
00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.639
A little before 10:00.
Kusaka had called at 9:00.

89
00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.559
Hold on! I never called anyone!

90
00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:15.459
That can't be. Right, Takeno?

91
00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.669
Yeah. Ikuta wasn't here,
so I answered for him.

92
00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.129
Where was he?

93
00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:26.429
Takeno had asked him to buy
snacks at the convenience store.

94
00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:29.219
You're certain it was
Kusaka-san's voice on the phone?

95
00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:30.549
Yes. There's no mistake.

96
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:32.759
I didn't call!

97
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.759
Then how did you
decide where to meet?

98
00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.599
Ikuta asked me there.
He put a note in my locker.

99
00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.809
Why did he ask you there?

100
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:43.019
Um, well...

101
00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:46.989
Didn't you say Ikuta
took your money?

102
00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:49.699
What is he talking about?

103
00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:53.509
Ikuta took the tuition
money I took to school...

104
00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.219
Do you still have that note of his?

105
00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:58.119
No, I threw it out.

106
00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:01.839
Or maybe there never was a note?!

107
00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:09.349
Ikuta-san stole your tuition
money and refused to give it back.

108
00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:13.389
So you phoned him out of
anger and beat him to death!

109
00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.179
No! Besides, I'm not the
only one who hated him!

110
00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:20.309
Nakamura and Takeno did too!

111
00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:22.559
Why did I?!

112
00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.529
You owed him lots of money!

113
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:29.029
I was in here the whole time!
Right, Shimizu?

114
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:34.239
Yeah. But you did step
out for some fresh air.

115
00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:36.199
Around what time was this?

116
00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:39.159
Around 10:00, when Ikuta had left.

117
00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:41.889
The same time the incident occurred...

118
00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:43.629
But it was only for a few minutes!

119
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:47.389
And why did you have
a grudge against Ikuta-san?

120
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:53.969
Ikuta and Togawa Keiko got stranded
in the mountains six months ago.

121
00:07:54.929 --> 00:08:00.889
Ikuta abandoned the injured
Keiko and left by himself.

122
00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:03.979
She had already frozen
to death when we found her.

123
00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:07.389
She and Takeno had been lovers!

124
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:10.479
Is this true?!

125
00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:13.179
Inspector.

126
00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:17.739
In mountain accidents, sometimes
you have to abandon your friends.

127
00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:22.759
I feel bad about Keiko,
but I don't blame Ikuta at all!

128
00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:26.669
Besides, I never took a single
step out of this apartment!

129
00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:30.009
That's true; he was
inside the whole time.

130
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:35.139
At 10:00, he went to the next
room to finish a report for class.

131
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:39.759
How long was he alone?

132
00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.849
Twenty or thirty minutes...

133
00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.849
But you can't get outside
without going through this room,

134
00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:47.849
so I can't see how
he could've done it.

135
00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:50.059
But a mountain climber could easily

136
00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:52.569
climb down a rope from the window.

137
00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:55.569
Not from that window.
See for yourself.

138
00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:07.249
See?

139
00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:13.219
That's as far as it goes?

140
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:16.969
No way anyone could
leave through here.

141
00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:22.389
Say, why did you have the lights
off if you were writing a report?

142
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:24.559
I saw on the way back from the store.

143
00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:28.399
The lights weren't
on in this room then.

144
00:09:28.849 --> 00:09:30.849
Um, well--

145
00:09:30.849 --> 00:09:33.509
Who cares about that?!

146
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:38.009
As there's no way through that
window, Takeno-san is innocent!

147
00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:46.249
A slingshot?

148
00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:50.389
The only phone is in this room?

149
00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:55.879
A red thread...

150
00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:02.389
Those are the same cigarettes...

151
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:06.309
Ikuta-san must've
been a heavy smoker.

152
00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:07.729
Alright...

153
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.189
Conan-kun!

154
00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:17.849
Omura-san's apartment is
directly below Takeno-san's!

155
00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:21.219
Come to think of it,
why did the window break then?!

156
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:26.499
Omura's Apartment

157
00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:30.209
Odd. Whatever broke
the window isn't in here.

158
00:10:31.969 --> 00:10:33.259
Blood!

159
00:10:34.349 --> 00:10:37.839
Is it the victim's?!
But what's it doing here?!

160
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.929
Isn't this a bloodstain?

161
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:41.139
What?!

162
00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:44.259
No question about it!

163
00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:46.759
Alright! I'll inform Inspector Megure!

164
00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:54.099
What's a bloodstain doing here?!

165
00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:58.529
Ikuta-san was standing
here in the dark.

166
00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:03.699
Could it be?!

167
00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:07.999
That bloodstain,
the place he was standing,

168
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:11.919
and Omura-san's broken
window all line up!

169
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.759
Which means...

170
00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:15.589
...at the top of this
building, there's--

171
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:25.559
A bloodstain!

172
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.519
And there's
Takeno-san's apartment!

173
00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:33.519
Now I know who killed him and how!

174
00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:40.754
Conan-kun! Where did you go?!

175
00:11:40.754 --> 00:11:42.134
Just looking around.

176
00:11:52.174 --> 00:11:53.374
I'm getting dizzy...

177
00:11:57.044 --> 00:12:00.504
Could I ask you to
come down to the station?

178
00:12:00.504 --> 00:12:02.754
Not so fast, Inspector Megure.

179
00:12:03.754 --> 00:12:07.924
I will now shed light
on the truth of this incident.

180
00:12:08.844 --> 00:12:09.964
What?!

181
00:12:09.964 --> 00:12:13.464
The key to this incident is
the location of the murder weapon.

182
00:12:13.464 --> 00:12:16.894
Yes. It was absent
from the scene of the crime.

183
00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:22.354
A bloodstain was left behind
on the nearby abandoned building,

184
00:12:23.044 --> 00:12:26.824
but there's one other
place with a bloodstain.

185
00:12:26.824 --> 00:12:28.654
What?! Where?!

186
00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:33.384
I was in Omura's apartment at the time,

187
00:12:33.384 --> 00:12:35.714
but something odd happened.

188
00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.254
Something odd?

189
00:12:37.254 --> 00:12:41.874
Immediately after the murder,
Omura's window shattered.

190
00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:44.794
Does that have to do with this?

191
00:12:45.214 --> 00:12:49.304
There was blood
on the pieces of glass.

192
00:12:49.674 --> 00:12:50.764
What does that entail?

193
00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:55.304
Before I explain,
I'd like you to check something.

194
00:12:55.844 --> 00:12:58.044
The roof of the abandoned building.

195
00:12:58.044 --> 00:13:01.094
If I'm correct, there should
be blood on the railing

196
00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:03.734
directly above
the bloodstain on the wall.

197
00:13:04.094 --> 00:13:05.384
What?!

198
00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:07.594
Detective Takagi! Go check it out!

199
00:13:07.594 --> 00:13:08.004
Yes, sir!

200
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:11.424
Give him a two-way radio.

201
00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:12.444
A radio?

202
00:13:13.094 --> 00:13:16.414
I'd like him to help
with something later on.

203
00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:22.844
What the...

204
00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:26.214
Inspector! There's blood
on the railing here!

205
00:13:26.754 --> 00:13:28.594
What?! Blood on the railing?!

206
00:13:28.594 --> 00:13:30.924
Just as I suspected.

207
00:13:30.924 --> 00:13:32.264
What does this mean?

208
00:13:33.044 --> 00:13:39.224
The wall, the railing, the glass
shards in Omura-san's apartment...

209
00:13:39.754 --> 00:13:42.774
Why is there blood
at these three spots?!

210
00:13:42.774 --> 00:13:47.924
The weapon that killed Ikuta-san
passed by those three spots.

211
00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:52.294
In other words, the killer
accomplished his murder from afar.

212
00:13:52.294 --> 00:13:55.994
Yes. The killer had
been in this very room...

213
00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:58.574
It was you, Takeno-san!

214
00:13:58.574 --> 00:13:59.414
What?!

215
00:14:00.544 --> 00:14:01.624
No way!

216
00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:04.424
Are you serious, Mori-san?!

217
00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:07.044
I couldn't possibly
kill him from here!

218
00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:10.044
Does anyone have fishing line?

219
00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:11.714
Fishing line?

220
00:14:11.714 --> 00:14:13.594
I do.

221
00:14:13.594 --> 00:14:16.214
I use it to hang up plastic models.

222
00:14:16.214 --> 00:14:17.264
Bring some here.

223
00:14:17.264 --> 00:14:18.924
Okay.

224
00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:25.984
Ran. Put some rocks in
that plastic bag you got earlier.

225
00:14:26.384 --> 00:14:27.194
Okay.

226
00:14:29.504 --> 00:14:30.864
Here you go, Mori.

227
00:14:30.864 --> 00:14:32.824
What're you going to do with this?

228
00:14:33.254 --> 00:14:34.464
Now then, Inspector.

229
00:14:34.464 --> 00:14:38.784
Tie two strands of
fishing line to a rock.

230
00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.924
Alright...

231
00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:42.884
Here, Inspector.

232
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:49.294
Once you're done,
use Takeno-san's slingshot

233
00:14:49.294 --> 00:14:52.674
to shoot the rock onto
the other building's roof.

234
00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:57.884
It's only a dozen meters away;
the length of a few taxicabs.

235
00:14:58.674 --> 00:15:01.184
Anyone can shoot it that far.

236
00:15:04.294 --> 00:15:05.604
Inspector.

237
00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.884
Have Detective Takagi untie the lines,

238
00:15:07.884 --> 00:15:13.384
pass them through the railing,
and then tie them together.

239
00:15:15.344 --> 00:15:17.404
Next, the rope on that shelf.

240
00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:20.114
Rope? Oh, that?

241
00:15:21.574 --> 00:15:26.204
Tie one of the
lines to one end of it.

242
00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:28.124
Like so?

243
00:15:28.634 --> 00:15:33.174
Now pull the other fishing line in.

244
00:15:44.594 --> 00:15:47.434
Mori-kun. What do I do with this rope?

245
00:15:47.844 --> 00:15:52.404
Ran. Tie the bag to
the other end of the rope.

246
00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:53.484
Right.

247
00:15:57.284 --> 00:16:00.244
Tie it tight so nothing comes out.

248
00:16:01.424 --> 00:16:02.704
All done, Dad!

249
00:16:02.704 --> 00:16:06.164
Mori-kun! Don't tell me this is the--

250
00:16:06.714 --> 00:16:08.874
Sounds like you've figured it out, too.

251
00:16:13.924 --> 00:16:15.924
Inspector! I'm at the spot!

252
00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:16.714
Good! Now we'll start!

253
00:16:17.214 --> 00:16:19.424
Eh? Start what?

254
00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:27.264
Well, Detective Takagi?!

255
00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:31.984
The bag passed directly above
the chalk lines and hit the wall!

256
00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:33.944
It's right next to the bloodstain!

257
00:16:33.944 --> 00:16:37.924
Takeno-san murdered Ikuta-san thusly,

258
00:16:37.924 --> 00:16:41.404
and then pulled the
rope in to recover the weapon.

259
00:16:42.254 --> 00:16:44.824
This would leave no
weapon at the murder scene.

260
00:16:49.924 --> 00:16:55.044
Inspector! The bag just hit
below Omura-san's broken window!

261
00:16:55.384 --> 00:17:00.014
Mori! Could that be the
thump I heard every night?

262
00:17:00.464 --> 00:17:04.044
Yes. Takeno-san had been practicing.

263
00:17:04.044 --> 00:17:07.094
But something unexpected
happened tonight:

264
00:17:07.094 --> 00:17:09.224
the weapon hit the window.

265
00:17:09.754 --> 00:17:11.894
So that's what broke it...

266
00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:13.354
Takeno.

267
00:17:14.594 --> 00:17:15.924
Mori-san!

268
00:17:15.924 --> 00:17:20.324
Ikuta went down there because
Kusaka asked him to on the phone!

269
00:17:21.174 --> 00:17:25.464
Had he not called,
I couldn't have set that trick up!

270
00:17:25.464 --> 00:17:30.044
Kusaka-san never
called anyone. It was all an act.

271
00:17:30.594 --> 00:17:34.004
But we did hear the phone ring!

272
00:17:34.594 --> 00:17:37.424
He could make it "ring" at any time

273
00:17:37.424 --> 00:17:42.424
by recording the sound and
setting a timer on it.

274
00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:44.014
All he had left to do
was pick up the phone

275
00:17:44.014 --> 00:17:48.434
and pretend like he
was talking to Kusaka-san.

276
00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:53.794
It was also Takeno-san who put
the note in Kusaka-san's locker.

277
00:17:53.794 --> 00:17:56.854
All to frame him
for Ikuta-san's murder!

278
00:17:57.604 --> 00:18:01.784
But how did he know where
Ikuta-san was standing?

279
00:18:02.504 --> 00:18:06.594
It was pitch-black
with the streetlight broken...

280
00:18:06.594 --> 00:18:10.834
Takeno-san broke it in advance
to make us think that way.

281
00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:14.294
Wouldn't that make it harder
to know where he'd be?!

282
00:18:14.884 --> 00:18:19.714
No, he knew where Ikuta-san was,
even in the dark.

283
00:18:20.214 --> 00:18:23.094
That's ridiculous. I'm not a bat.

284
00:18:23.094 --> 00:18:24.174
Ran.

285
00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:27.924
What was Ikuta-san doing on
your way back from the store?

286
00:18:27.924 --> 00:18:31.594
Well, he was standing
beneath the broken streetlight...

287
00:18:31.594 --> 00:18:34.214
Oh yeah, and he was smoking!

288
00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:39.044
As a heavy smoker, Ikuta-san
dropped lots of cigarette butts.

289
00:18:39.044 --> 00:18:44.044
Takeno-san. You aimed
at the light from the cigarette

290
00:18:44.044 --> 00:18:46.094
and dropped the weapon on him.

291
00:18:47.634 --> 00:18:52.994
You had the lights off to prevent
anyone from seeing the weapon!

292
00:18:53.294 --> 00:19:00.384
Which means there's a plastic
bag full of rocks still in here!

293
00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:04.634
Then check the apartment!
I have no plastic bags!

294
00:19:04.924 --> 00:19:06.384
Takeno-san.

295
00:19:06.384 --> 00:19:10.054
Those are some thick
socks for this time of year.

296
00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:14.104
Those are mountain-climbing socks.

297
00:19:14.594 --> 00:19:19.594
You turned them inside-out
and filled them with rocks.

298
00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:24.114
Later, you put the rocks in
the fish tank and fixed your socks.

299
00:19:24.114 --> 00:19:29.094
As proof, there's a
thread in the water plant!

300
00:19:29.094 --> 00:19:32.534
One that's the same
color as your socks.

301
00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:38.754
These are sturdy enough to be
used as the weapon and not rip...

302
00:19:39.594 --> 00:19:43.794
There should be blood
on the inside of those socks.

303
00:19:43.794 --> 00:19:45.594
Ikuta-san's blood!

304
00:19:46.044 --> 00:19:50.304
Mind if I have a look, Takeno-san?

305
00:19:51.174 --> 00:19:53.014
There's no need.

306
00:19:53.014 --> 00:19:54.014
Takeno!

307
00:19:54.464 --> 00:19:57.934
Did you do it because of
Togawa Keiko-san's death?

308
00:19:58.504 --> 00:19:59.714
Yes.

309
00:19:59.714 --> 00:20:05.904
As I said, sometimes you have to
abandon friends in mountain accidents.

310
00:20:06.424 --> 00:20:11.384
I constantly told myself
I couldn't blame Ikuta.

311
00:20:11.384 --> 00:20:14.464
But when I think about
never seeing her again,

312
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.714
I feel as if I've been
left all alone in this world,

313
00:20:17.714 --> 00:20:21.424
I was so lonely that
I felt I was going crazy.

314
00:20:21.424 --> 00:20:25.134
Then, when I entered a pub one day...

315
00:20:26.344 --> 00:20:28.214
Yeah, that's right!

316
00:20:28.634 --> 00:20:34.294
Keiko dumped me so I left her to die!

317
00:20:34.964 --> 00:20:37.144
That's horrible!

318
00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:51.844
He had to pay for letting my
precious Keiko die for no reason!

319
00:20:51.844 --> 00:20:55.074
And so did Kusaka,
who laughed at the story!

320
00:20:59.464 --> 00:21:03.624
The rest was just as Mori-san said!

321
00:22:39.044 --> 00:22:44.544
Nothing beats beer after
solving a crime! It's the greatest!

322
00:22:44.544 --> 00:22:49.154
It's getting late;
we should call it quits for--

323
00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:53.544
Don't say that!
Let's get this party goin'!

324
00:22:53.544 --> 00:22:55.594
But I'm exhausted...

325
00:22:55.594 --> 00:22:59.534
I feel great, like I just had a nap!

326
00:23:00.254 --> 00:23:04.494
Maybe because you did just have a nap!

327
00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:12.794
What's the matter, Ran-neechan?

328
00:23:12.794 --> 00:23:19.004
Tonight was the Tanabata, the one
day a year that lovers can meet.

329
00:23:19.004 --> 00:23:21.594
I wonder how Shinichi is doing...

330
00:23:22.674 --> 00:23:23.514
Ran...

331
00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:30.424
I'm sure he's looking
up at the same starry sky!

332
00:23:30.424 --> 00:23:31.234
Yeah...

333
00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:47.584
Are you Shiota Heihachiro-san?!

334
00:23:48.004 --> 00:23:50.044
Shiota Heihachiro?!

335
00:23:50.634 --> 00:23:53.634
This geezer is that
legendary detective?!

336
00:24:00.504 --> 00:24:02.094
This was a murder!

337
00:24:02.844 --> 00:24:04.814
Everyone stay where you are!

338
00:24:05.384 --> 00:24:07.724
Darn it! Right before my very eyes!

339
00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:09.964
On the next Conan--

340
00:24:09.964 --> 00:24:12.344

Next Conan's Hint:
Vinyl Tape.

343

Vinyl Tape.
