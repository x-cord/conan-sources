1
00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:05.485
Impossible murder?

2
00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:09.085
Well, there is the possibility of your footprints being there

3
00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:12.285
are already before the body had been lowered.

4
00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:17.185
Is that right, early-bird police detective?

5
00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.385
When I arrived at the Torada residence,

6
00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.985
I was told that everybody went searching for Ayaka Tatsuo.

7
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:25.285
That's why I came.

8
00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:28.885
Still, the timing seems to be too perfect, maybe.

9
00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:33.385
It could be that Ayaka had been asked on her cell phone

10
00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:34.985
to come out of the toilet

11
00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:37.785
was put to sleep, staging it to look like suicide

12
00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:40.685
and returning to the Torada residence, pretending to know nothing.

13
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.885
I don't think that's possible.

14
00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:48.285
I saw the police detective put her down on the ground

15
00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:51.585
and I didn't see any footprints or traces of his cane.

16
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.785
By the way, I heard she was acting strange

17
00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:56.385
right before she locked herself up in the toilet.

18
00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.085
What happened?

19
00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.185
Last night, we saw from our room

20
00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.785
the silhouette of an armored warrior on our screen door.

21
00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:06.485
When we said the helmet

22
00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:08.085
looked like a Suwa Hossyou from the shape of it,

23
00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.685
Ayaka started to tremble.

24
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.685
It is a curse.

25
00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:16.785
They brought on the curse of Lord Shingen

26
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.085
and were driven to their deaths.

27
00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:24.285
And the dead centipede is the proof of it!

28
00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.185
Why Shingen Takeda and the centipede?

29
00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:30.685
Don't you know?

30
00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:34.585
Lord Shingen called his messengers in the battlefield

31
00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:36.785
the "Centipedes".

32
00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:40.285
And made them bear centipede banners.

33
00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:41.785
So, that's why!

34
00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:45.085
I thought I was centipede drawings somewhere.

35
00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:47.285
I saw someone carrying the banner

36
00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:49.585
in the mock battle staged in the festival.

37
00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:53.885
And you were searching for the treasure, not knowing such things?

38
00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.085
Then the treasure you're looking for...

39
00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:59.285
Shingen Takeda's?

40
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.885
Yes, the hidden treasure of Shingen!

41
00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:05.285
Ever since scrolls and maps suggesting its existence

42
00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:06.785
were found in our warehouse,

43
00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:09.985
Shigetsugu became absorbed in it.

44
00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:14.285
The two who died before, as well as Ayaka

45
00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:20.385
and Akira Tatsuo over there, got involved in it.

46
00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:22.285
It wasn't greed!

47
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:23.685
We thought that if really found,

48
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.285
it will be a great way to revive the community.

49
00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:30.085
And, why must Ayaka be cursed?

50
00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:34.185
She just paid visits to the excavation site to bring food and supplies?

51
00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:36.385
It's not a curse at all.

52
00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:39.885
This is a genuine case of serial murders!

53
00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:42.585
Like that mustached guy says.

54
00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:47.485
I couldn't find Ayaka's cell phone in her belt bag.

55
00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:52.485
She had been lured out of where she locked herself up.

56
00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:55.185
By the serial murderer.

57
00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:58.185
Well, if you don't have to end up dead,

58
00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:00.585
make sure you don't walk around alone.

59
00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:07.785
Especially those who had been treasure hunters.

60
00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:15.885
Really? So, the warrior was standing right here?

61
00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:19.485
Yeah, though it disappeared right away.

62
00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:24.185
Why didn't you open the door and use your karate to catch it?

63
00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:27.585
But I was petrified because I thought I saw a ghost!

64
00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.785
And karate and aikido don't work on ghosts.

65
00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.985
Silly! There aren't any ghosts here.

66
00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:38.085
See what it is.

67
00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.285
Plastic rope used in packages!

68
00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.885
The rope appears to be shredded into fiber.

69
00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:45.685
I saw a few on them in the corridor and on the ground.

70
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:46.785
I get it!

71
00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:51.385
If you shred it, bundle the fiber and attach it to a helment.

72
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:53.185
The silhouette seen through the screen door

73
00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:57.785
will look like Shingen Takeda's Suwa Hossyo helmet!

74
00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:01.185
Then, it's the armor found in Shigetsugu's room,

75
00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.185
the one used in festivals?

76
00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:04.385
No.

77
00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:05.385
Look at that!

78
00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:09.085
There are strange straw sandal footprints!

79
00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:12.485
They're leading all the way out of the back gate!

80
00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:15.785
That means, someone from outside entered,

81
00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:19.485
took the suit of armor and created the Shingen silhouette.

82
00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:23.185
Either that or someone in the house left the footprints there

83
00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:26.385
to make it look like an outsider entered the house.

84
00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.285
Come to think of it, Shigetsugu was saying,

85
00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:33.685
there's another suit of armor in Akira's house.

86
00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:36.185
There's another set in the other house?

87
00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.585
Yeah.

88
00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:41.085
The armor at the Tatsuo house is supposedly great-looking.

89
00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:45.685
Then, we'll go check out the Tatsuos.

90
00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.885
You two stay with Pops.

91
00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:49.385
What?

92
00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:52.085
Just to let you know, uncle.

93
00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:56.485
Keep an eye from that treasure hunter Shigetsugu!

94
00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:58.885
I know what to do!

95
00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:01.585
-Okay, see ya! -Darn!

96
00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:03.685
We're left behind again.

97
00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:07.785
I think he doesn't want you to get hurt.

98
00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:10.785
Yeah, we often see horrid stuff

99
00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:13.685
and get chased by murderers.

100
00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:15.485
You think so?

101
00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:17.885
Yeah! He's trying to be evasive now

102
00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.185
and brag about his discovery later on!

103
00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:24.185
Shinichi used to do that. Really.

104
00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:26.485
But in Shinichi's case, it has nothing to do with

105
00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:27.985
liking you a lot or something like that.

106
00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:32.885
"Let your rapidity be that of the wind."

107
00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:37.585
You like him, don't you? That tanned boy.

108
00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:39.385
No...

109
00:05:39.385 --> 00:05:45.185
You might choose to sit tight, immovable as a mountain.

110
00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:47.785
The other is to take swift action,

111
00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:52.685
like the wind, when the affection is still burning in you.

112
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.485
If you leave it untouched,

113
00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:56.285
before you let know how you feel...

114
00:05:56.285 --> 00:05:59.685
that person might disappear from you

115
00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:02.885
and make you regret over what you didn't do.

116
00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:06.385
Like me.

117
00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:15.185
It's strange, isn't it, Kudo?

118
00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:21.485
Yeah, the gag that sealed Ayaka's mouth!

119
00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:25.185
At first, I thought it was for not letting out a sound.

120
00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.985
But if you're going to make it look like

121
00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:29.585
a suicide driven by Shingen's curse,

122
00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:31.285
you would take it off, wouldn't you?

123
00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:34.285
So, that means there was a reason for not taking it off.

124
00:06:34.285 --> 00:06:37.185
Or was it deliberate?

125
00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:41.685
If it were deliberate, why would that be necessary?

126
00:06:41.685 --> 00:06:44.185
I don't see the possibility of a corpse talking.

127
00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:46.585
Might be a signal to someone?

128
00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:49.685
Like, keep quiet, don't talk?

129
00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:58.785
Well, this is quite impressive.

130
00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.785
It's red, meaning Shingen's red?

131
00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:03.685
Yes.

132
00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:06.285
Is this family somehow related to the Takeda family?

133
00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:10.185
No. My mother and I are just great Shingen fans.

134
00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:12.685
We invested a small fortune into it.

135
00:07:12.685 --> 00:07:17.385
The late Koji-kun, my son, and Torada's Yoshiro

136
00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:19.685
were also Shingen fans.

137
00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:21.685
They often came here to take a look.

138
00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:24.585
My other son Akira wasn't all that interested, though.

139
00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:27.585
Both Koji and Akira are your sons, right?

140
00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.385
Why do you refer to Koji as "Koji-kun"

141
00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:32.085
while you call Akira simply as Akira?

142
00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:34.685
Actually Koji-kun was my son-in-law,

143
00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:36.685
married to my daughter born after Akira.

144
00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:38.285
He adopted our family name.

145
00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:43.185
My daughter died long time ago in a traffic accident.

146
00:07:43.185 --> 00:07:44.685
Long before the marriage,

147
00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:47.285
Koji-kun had been classmates with Akira at school

148
00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:49.585
and frequented our house as a kid.

149
00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:52.085
I've been calling him "Koji-kun" since then and couldn't kick the habit.

150
00:07:52.085 --> 00:07:54.085
Talking of classmates,

151
00:07:54.085 --> 00:07:56.985
Yoshiro and Shigetsugu of the Torada family

152
00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:59.985
had been classmates, too.

153
00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:04.085
How can brothers born in different years be classmates?

154
00:08:04.085 --> 00:08:06.585
Well, Yoshiro

155
00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:10.085
is the son of Naonobu Torada's elder sister,

156
00:08:10.085 --> 00:08:13.085
who died with her husband long ago.

157
00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:14.185
He had been adopted into the family

158
00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:17.185
and was brought up with Shigetsugu like brothers.

159
00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:19.785
So, that means the three who died recently

160
00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:24.285
actually aren't related to either the Toradas or the Tatsuos?

161
00:08:24.285 --> 00:08:28.385
Right. And, Ayaka was Akira's wife.

162
00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:32.185
Hey, what's that banner behind the armor?

163
00:08:32.185 --> 00:08:36.185
Oh, that's a replica.

164
00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.685
Can you read it, son?

165
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.185
Let your rapidity be that of the wind,

166
00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:43.985
your silence that of the forest.

167
00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:47.185
In raiding and plundering be like fire,

168
00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:50.985
in immovability like a mountain.

169
00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:55.685
From Art of War, the ancient teaching in military warfare from Sun Tzu.

170
00:08:55.685 --> 00:08:57.385
I got it!

171
00:08:57.385 --> 00:08:59.485
Left abandoned after being seriously injured

172
00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:02.385
in the tornado, Yoshiro.

173
00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:03.585
Wind!

174
00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:10.685
Yoshiro, tied and buried in a mound shaped like a mountain.

175
00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:12.085
Mountain!

176
00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:17.785
Ayaka gagged and hung from a tree in the middle of the woods.

177
00:09:17.785 --> 00:09:18.885
Forest!

178
00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:20.685
Then it can't be...

179
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.785
Yes, the killings

180
00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:25.485
are patterned after Shingen Takeda's military slogan!

181
00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:28.485
The strategy he embraced.

182
00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:34.285
The "Fuurinkazan"!

183
00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:49.152
What? Fuurinkazan?

184
00:09:49.152 --> 00:09:52.752
The killings are being executed after that pattern?

185
00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:53.952
Right.

186
00:09:53.952 --> 00:09:58.952
Think back carefully! Three murders in a row!

187
00:09:58.952 --> 00:10:02.052
First, there was Yoshiro Torada, who was seriously injured

188
00:10:02.052 --> 00:10:04.852
in a tornado and left to die.

189
00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:07.052
Tornado means wind,

190
00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:10.852
referring to "let your rapidity be that of the wind."

191
00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:16.652
Next, the second was Koji found tied up and buried in a mound.

192
00:10:16.652 --> 00:10:19.252
He was tied up so he can't move,

193
00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:22.952
like a mountain.

194
00:10:22.952 --> 00:10:26.752
"In immovability like a mountain." Mountain!

195
00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:32.352
And the third murder of Ayaka Tatsuo, found dead in the forest.

196
00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:37.252
If the gag was a message to be quiet and not talk...

197
00:10:37.252 --> 00:10:38.352
I see.

198
00:10:38.352 --> 00:10:42.452
The message was "your silence that of a forest".

199
00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:43.452
Right.

200
00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:48.652
This serial murderer seems to have a fixation for Shingen Takeda.

201
00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:51.452
But, why Shingen?

202
00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:56.152
Is it a plot to block them from finding Shingen's hidden treasure?

203
00:10:56.152 --> 00:10:57.852
Beats me.

204
00:10:57.852 --> 00:11:00.552
So far, what we know

205
00:11:00.552 --> 00:11:04.852
is that we still have the character "fire" left from that phrase.

206
00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:06.752
It means that the killer is scheming

207
00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:10.552
to take the life of one more person!

208
00:11:10.552 --> 00:11:13.452
Then does that mean the next target

209
00:11:13.452 --> 00:11:16.952
is either Shigetsugu or Akira,

210
00:11:16.952 --> 00:11:19.152
who had cooperated in the treasure hunt?

211
00:11:19.152 --> 00:11:22.052
Yeah. That's highly likely.

212
00:11:22.052 --> 00:11:23.852
But, there still is the off chance

213
00:11:23.852 --> 00:11:26.752
that the next victim is someone else.

214
00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:29.952
Anyway, we'll be on the lookout for that one.

215
00:11:29.952 --> 00:11:32.652
I want Pops to keep an eye on the guys!

216
00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:34.752
Especially, Shigetsugu.

217
00:11:34.752 --> 00:11:35.952
Yeah.

218
00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:39.352
Ran. What's "Fuurinkazan"?

219
00:11:39.352 --> 00:11:43.052
I don't know. I think I've heard about it on TV and movies.

220
00:11:43.052 --> 00:11:45.252
What, you don't know?

221
00:11:45.252 --> 00:11:47.552
Let your rapidity be that of the wind,

222
00:11:47.552 --> 00:11:50.352
your silence that of the forest.

223
00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:53.052
In raiding and plundering be like fire,

224
00:11:53.052 --> 00:11:55.652
in immovability like a mountain.

225
00:11:55.652 --> 00:11:57.752
It's an approach to warfare

226
00:11:57.752 --> 00:12:00.252
conceived by a master named Sun Tzu.

227
00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:04.052
When you mobilize an army, you have to be swift as the wind.

228
00:12:04.052 --> 00:12:07.352
When you stop the army's movement, as quiet as a forest.

229
00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.552
When attacking, you have to be as fierce as fire!

230
00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:14.352
If you decide to defend, be as immovable as a mountain.

231
00:12:14.352 --> 00:12:18.152
Shingen Takeda embraced this Art of War

232
00:12:18.152 --> 00:12:20.752
and displayed it in his war banners.

233
00:12:20.752 --> 00:12:24.552
That was what Yui had been telling us.

234
00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:28.552
You might choose to sit tight, immovable as a mountain.

235
00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:30.852
The other is to take swift action,

236
00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:35.352
like the wind, when the affection is still burning in you.

237
00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:37.752
Right! It applies in the game of love, too.

238
00:12:37.752 --> 00:12:40.152
Fuurinkazan is the way to go!

239
00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:57.152
Here you are!

240
00:12:59.152 --> 00:13:01.252
I don't think practice will do you any good

241
00:13:01.252 --> 00:13:02.952
when you're down over

242
00:13:02.952 --> 00:13:04.852
the loss of your wife.

243
00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.952
I must, with the festival approaching.

244
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.952
Nothing can interrupt practice.

245
00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:11.652
I pledge to my mentor Kai

246
00:13:11.652 --> 00:13:16.152
that I will defend the title of the horseback archer the best I can.

247
00:13:17.152 --> 00:13:21.452
And, it was also the wish of my wife Ayaka.

248
00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:23.052
And the reason why I missed

249
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.352
wasn't because of any emotional problems.

250
00:13:25.352 --> 00:13:28.652
Look, can you see traces of the target being moved slightly?

251
00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:30.352
Right you are.

252
00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.352
I wonder who did it.

253
00:13:34.052 --> 00:13:36.052
Right behind the trees! I see people!

254
00:13:37.352 --> 00:13:38.652
Who are you?

255
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:39.852
Wait up!

256
00:13:41.052 --> 00:13:43.952
Probably people from the neighboring village.

257
00:13:45.152 --> 00:13:47.752
They're trying to make me lose confidence.

258
00:13:47.752 --> 00:13:49.452
What ever for?

259
00:13:49.452 --> 00:13:51.952
Because the honor of the village is at stake.

260
00:13:53.852 --> 00:13:55.052
The festival

261
00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:59.252
has been traditionally organized by the two villages

262
00:13:59.252 --> 00:14:01.552
and there is only one archer in horseback archery,

263
00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:03.652
which is the highlight of the event.

264
00:14:03.652 --> 00:14:05.752
If they are able to crush Akira,

265
00:14:05.752 --> 00:14:07.152
who went through the preliminaries

266
00:14:07.152 --> 00:14:09.052
and became village representative,

267
00:14:09.052 --> 00:14:12.652
the star of the festival will be the archer of their village

268
00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:15.952
and will be able to brag all year long.

269
00:14:15.952 --> 00:14:17.652
Starting with Kai,

270
00:14:17.652 --> 00:14:20.852
the title had been ours for more than 10 years.

271
00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:23.252
About the preliminaries, how are they've done?

272
00:14:23.252 --> 00:14:24.552
It takes place in the shrine grounds,

273
00:14:24.552 --> 00:14:26.752
with ten targets positioned in equal distance from each other,

274
00:14:26.752 --> 00:14:28.952
calculating the success rate.

275
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.852
Again and again, until the winner is chosen.

276
00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:38.352
Yes. Six years ago, you and Kai didn't miss a mark.

277
00:14:38.352 --> 00:14:39.852
The sun began to set,

278
00:14:39.852 --> 00:14:43.052
so the competition was to continue the next day.

279
00:14:43.052 --> 00:14:46.652
Then, Kai went missing.

280
00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:50.052
And I found him dead one week later.

281
00:14:50.052 --> 00:14:51.552
Yes.

282
00:14:51.552 --> 00:14:54.152
If the competition had continued the next day,

283
00:14:54.152 --> 00:14:57.152
I would've lost.

284
00:14:57.152 --> 00:14:58.652
After the tie,

285
00:14:58.652 --> 00:15:01.552
Kai told me that he was going on the refresher practice.

286
00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:06.352
As for me, I was exhausted and wasn't able to move anymore.

287
00:15:06.352 --> 00:15:09.352
He went to practice, when it was already dark?

288
00:15:09.352 --> 00:15:10.752
Yeah.

289
00:15:10.752 --> 00:15:12.852
So long as he knew the location of the targets,

290
00:15:12.852 --> 00:15:16.752
he was able to hit them with his eyes closed.

291
00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:19.952
But, he missed one in the last competition, didn't he?

292
00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.252
I'm sure

293
00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:24.152
it was the doing of the people from the neighboring village!

294
00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:29.352
The target was moved intentionally to embarrass Kai!

295
00:15:30.752 --> 00:15:36.952
Not knowing that, Uncle Naonobu was furious at Kai.

296
00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:40.352
You disgraced me!

297
00:15:40.352 --> 00:15:42.152
Why was it a disgrace?

298
00:15:42.152 --> 00:15:46.652
I heard that Uncle taught Kai horseback archery.

299
00:15:46.652 --> 00:15:48.852
And, it developed into an argument

300
00:15:48.852 --> 00:15:52.152
with Grandmother Shigeyo who happened to step in.

301
00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:55.952
How dare you act like that when you've never even once

302
00:15:55.952 --> 00:15:58.752
been an archer of the festival?

303
00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:03.252
So most everyone had ties to this person Kai.

304
00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:04.652
Right.

305
00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:09.552
And, every one of them is a suspect of the serial murders.

306
00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.652
I investigated thoroughly into the site

307
00:16:12.652 --> 00:16:14.952
where Ayaka Tatsuo was found dead.

308
00:16:14.952 --> 00:16:17.352
And only found footprints of the members of the search party,

309
00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.252
hoof prints,

310
00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:23.252
and tracks of scooter and car tires.

311
00:16:23.252 --> 00:16:24.452
In other words,

312
00:16:24.452 --> 00:16:26.652
the people who were able to commit the crime,

313
00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.952
except for you outsiders, are seven people,

314
00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:33.652
Naonobu, Tatsue, Shigetsuku and Yui of the Torada family

315
00:16:33.652 --> 00:16:39.052
and Shigeyo, Tamefumi and Akira of the Tatsuo family.

316
00:16:39.052 --> 00:16:41.852
There are eight!

317
00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:46.252
Your footprints. There were traces of your cane, too...

318
00:16:46.252 --> 00:16:47.352
Isn't that right, police detective?

319
00:16:47.352 --> 00:16:48.352
Okay!

320
00:16:48.352 --> 00:16:50.452
Include me, if you want to!

321
00:16:50.452 --> 00:16:54.152
Mrs. Torada, you came to pick up that black horse, right?

322
00:16:54.152 --> 00:16:57.752
Then take it and go back home right away!

323
00:16:57.752 --> 00:17:01.852
You, too. Take the brats and go back to the Tatsuos!

324
00:17:01.852 --> 00:17:02.852
Yes.

325
00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:05.652
When you get back, tell the people that

326
00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:07.652
the killer is among you!

327
00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:12.052
Tell them to pray to the gods while they wait for me to arrive

328
00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:14.952
and get my hands on the murderer!

329
00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:25.952
You no longer call me by my name, Kan.

330
00:17:25.952 --> 00:17:30.752
Sorry, but you're no longer Yui that I knew from childhood.

331
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.352
Neither are you my subordinate Officer Uehara.

332
00:17:34.152 --> 00:17:37.452
You're just the wife of a murder victim

333
00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:39.852
and one of the suspects.

334
00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:42.752
A subordinate? That means...

335
00:17:42.752 --> 00:17:44.552
A former detective?

336
00:17:46.152 --> 00:17:48.152
How many times do I have to tell you?

337
00:17:48.152 --> 00:17:52.352
I see no reason why anybody would want to kill me!

338
00:17:52.352 --> 00:17:55.052
What in the world are you doing?

339
00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:56.452
With all these things going on,

340
00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:58.752
I decided the treasure hunt must be interrupted.

341
00:17:58.752 --> 00:18:01.052
So, I came to pick up my documents.

342
00:18:01.052 --> 00:18:02.452
But, I can't find it.

343
00:18:02.452 --> 00:18:05.652
The notes I took while searching for the treasure.

344
00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:09.152
Don't you think Akira might have taken them?

345
00:18:09.152 --> 00:18:13.952
You and he are the only survivors of the excavation team.

346
00:18:13.952 --> 00:18:16.452
Maybe to keep the treasure for himself.

347
00:18:16.452 --> 00:18:19.252
No way! Akira won't do such a thing!

348
00:18:19.252 --> 00:18:21.852
He's the hero of our class!

349
00:18:21.852 --> 00:18:26.552
But, people change, you know, Shigetsugu.

350
00:18:26.552 --> 00:18:29.152
He is a Tatsuo, after all.

351
00:18:29.152 --> 00:18:31.752
You never know what really on his mind!

352
00:18:31.752 --> 00:18:36.252
Don't put him on the same level as that good-for-nothing son of yours!

353
00:18:36.252 --> 00:18:40.552
Akira is a samurai! An archer of the festival for five straight years!

354
00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.252
What are you doing here?

355
00:18:42.252 --> 00:18:44.352
We're looking for Akira.

356
00:18:44.352 --> 00:18:46.652
We thought he might be here.

357
00:18:46.652 --> 00:18:49.152
I just got a call from Heiji

358
00:18:49.152 --> 00:18:52.052
that Akira had just finished his archery practice

359
00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:53.552
and is on his way home.

360
00:18:53.552 --> 00:18:58.552
Anyway, let us all go home and wait.

361
00:18:58.552 --> 00:19:01.152
Until the case is settled.

362
00:19:01.152 --> 00:19:03.952
You, too, Mr. Shigetsugu!

363
00:19:03.952 --> 00:19:05.452
All right.

364
00:19:05.452 --> 00:19:07.952
Then, we will be going this way.

365
00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:10.752
Be careful on your way home!

366
00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:13.152
That ogre of a woman!

367
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.552
Who's going to attack that monster?

368
00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:19.952
The feeling's mutual, you bald racoon dog!

369
00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:22.152
Well...

370
00:19:22.152 --> 00:19:24.352
Don't you two remember what Shingen said?

371
00:19:24.352 --> 00:19:28.252
"Friendship is your ally, enmity is your foe."

372
00:19:29.552 --> 00:19:31.452
Shouldn't you stop quarreling

373
00:19:31.452 --> 00:19:33.752
and cooperate to solve this case,

374
00:19:33.752 --> 00:19:36.452
for the good of both families?

375
00:19:39.852 --> 00:19:43.052
I don't need to hear that from a dullard like you!

376
00:19:43.052 --> 00:19:47.252
Those were Officer Kai's pet phrase.

377
00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:52.952
He used to settle disputes between the families with those words.

378
00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:56.452
You, Shingen-freak dolt!

379
00:20:00.752 --> 00:20:04.152
Will you be my wife when you grow up?

380
00:20:05.752 --> 00:20:09.352
Just kidding! Kansuke will start complaining!

381
00:20:10.852 --> 00:20:13.752
Hey, don't call me "master".

382
00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:17.552
I may be older than you. But you are my rival!

383
00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:19.652
Just call me Kai!

384
00:20:21.852 --> 00:20:23.352
Hey, Hattori.

385
00:20:23.352 --> 00:20:27.952
Why does the killer pattern the murders after "Fuurinkazan"?

386
00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:30.852
It might have something to do with

387
00:20:30.852 --> 00:20:35.152
the three of them looking for Shingen's treasure.

388
00:20:35.152 --> 00:20:37.752
Or trying to make it look like that,

389
00:20:37.752 --> 00:20:40.752
trying to hide the real motive.

390
00:20:40.752 --> 00:20:45.552
But, the tornado that swept off Yoshiro was a coincidence.

391
00:20:45.552 --> 00:20:50.152
Still, there was the dead centipede ready to be placed near him.

392
00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:55.152
So, the killer had been planning to kill the three for a long time.

393
00:20:55.152 --> 00:20:59.752
Then, I need to find out what Yoshiro and Koji

394
00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:03.652
wanted to talk about with that police detective Yamato.

395
00:21:03.652 --> 00:21:09.952
And why Ayaka was horrified by the story of Shingen's helmet.

396
00:21:09.952 --> 00:21:12.152
And the other thing that bugs me.

397
00:21:12.152 --> 00:21:13.852
Yeah.

398
00:21:13.852 --> 00:21:16.952
Officer Kai falling off the cliff.

399
00:21:16.952 --> 00:21:19.952
Anyway, we still have the character

400
00:21:19.952 --> 00:21:22.252
for "fire" left from "Fuurinkazan."

401
00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:27.752
Who's next? It is Akira! Or is it...

402
00:21:32.452 --> 00:21:34.852
What was that?

403
00:21:34.852 --> 00:21:37.752
It sounded like thunder.

404
00:21:37.752 --> 00:21:40.652
Heiji! Something's happened!

405
00:21:40.652 --> 00:21:43.552
What, Kazuha? What is it?

406
00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.152
There was a big noise and when I turned around,

407
00:21:46.152 --> 00:21:48.052
Shigetsugu was gone.

408
00:21:48.052 --> 00:21:50.052
When I came looking for him to the railway crossing,

409
00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:51.952
the train was stopped there.

410
00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:54.352
At the head of the train.

411
00:21:56.252 --> 00:21:58.852
A person was lying on the ground. A person is burning!

412
00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:00.552
A person is burning?

413
00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:03.652
Yeah. Is that Shigetsugu?

414
00:22:03.652 --> 00:22:06.352
Stay there! I'll be there right now!

415
00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:12.652
Is that "In raiding and plundering be like fire"?

416
00:23:34.352 --> 00:23:38.952
And there was a dead centipede beside the case.

417
00:23:38.952 --> 00:23:42.552
That means Shigetsugu didn't die of an accident?

418
00:23:42.552 --> 00:23:45.452
Yeah... serial murder...

419
00:23:45.452 --> 00:23:47.052
Yes.

420
00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:48.752
Thunder.

421
00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:52.752
So it seems...

422
00:23:52.752 --> 00:23:55.452
The battle isn't over yet...

423
00:23:58.452 --> 00:23:59.852
Next Conan,

424
00:23:59.852 --> 00:24:01.052
"Fuurinkazan:"

425
00:24:01.052 --> 00:24:03.852
"The Conclusion in Lightning and Shadow"

426
00:24:04.852 --> 00:24:07.152
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:07.152 --> 00:24:09.052
Eyeshadow.

428
00:24:09.052 --> 00:24:10.552
It's from 7 pm again!

429
00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:13.952
Mystery-solving Conan and Yatta-man resumes.
