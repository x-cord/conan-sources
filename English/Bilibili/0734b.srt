1
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:05.931
Hey, what is it?

2
00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:10.631
What do you officers want to ask us so suddenly?

3
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:13.631
Are you saying we did something?

4
00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:16.231
Before we go any further, first of all,

5
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:20.631
please let us check to see if in your pockets or bags,

6
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.731
you have any 5 yen coins that are painted black?

7
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:27.131
5 yen coins that are painted black?

8
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.031
What's that about?

9
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:32.231
Why would I have something so strange like...

10
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:35.931
Why is something like this...

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.331
I found it, black 5 yen coins.

12
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.731
-I've found one too. -Me too.

13
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:46.331
This is...

14
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:49.531
You mean all three have it?

15
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.131
What on earth is going on?

16
00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:53.331
What's this grotesque 5 yen coin about?

17
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:56.131
That's what the pickpocket Kurobei

18
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.831
left behind for you as a gift, you see.

19
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:01.831
Huh? No joke? Then you mean I was pickpocketed?

20
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:07.331
Oh. I realized a while ago that I didn't have my wallet

21
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:10.031
and was just about to report it to the police.

22
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:13.531
Well, I didn't have much inside anyway,

23
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.931
so she could go ahead and take it, but...

24
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:17.931
Did you nab that pickpocket?

25
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:19.931
No, not really.

26
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.831
Just a while ago, she was found dead.

27
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:25.531
What?

28
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:30.531
We think that one of you is the perp.

29
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.331
One of us?

30
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.731
No.

31
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:37.331
You mean we're not victims?

32
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.631
We'll start with a body check of all of you

33
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:44.431
then check your belongings and cell phone.

34
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.431
Of course, this is voluntary so you may reject this.

35
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:52.931
Only if you do reject, I think you'll have more problems later.

36
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.831
-So if at all possible... -Okay!

37
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.131
Go on and check me if you want to!

38
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:59.731
But, mind you,

39
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:02.831
I'm fat, so my cell phone may be sticky.

40
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.631
Put up with that, will you?

41
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:07.731
Jodie?

42
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.631
Did you notice something?

43
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:13.931
No. I was just recalling a man from a video

44
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.731
you previously took for me.

45
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:18.031
Remember, the time when we deliberately dropped our cell phone

46
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.531
and made them pick it up to figure out who the spy

47
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:23.731
the Organization snuck into the hospital was?

48
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.331
The first one who picked it up

49
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.831
was an oily skinned fat man.

50
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:32.631
But the one who picked it up after him was the spy,

51
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.231
and the last one, an old man had a pace maker imbedded.

52
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:40.231
And that cell phone... Shu...

53
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:45.431
Why don't we take her on the car of an acquaintance of mine?

54
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.631
-Huh? -We could lie her down in the backseat.

55
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:51.531
Because those bad buys probably think that

56
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:53.431
she's going to be carried off in a large car

57
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:55.131
that can accommodate a stretcher.

58
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.131
I think they'll never find out!

59
00:02:57.131 --> 00:02:59.531
I guess so, but...

60
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:02.831
I'll go outside and call him then.

61
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.831
I'm sure he'll come right away.

62
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:11.531
That's something I can't do, not even for you, sonny.

63
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:14.631
This is a job for the FBI.

64
00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:17.931
We can't afford to get ordinary citizens

65
00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.931
involved in something like this anymore.

66
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.231
Oh, but...

67
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:24.831
Leave the rest to us.

68
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.231
Jodie?

69
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:32.131
That's not of any concern now, is it?

70
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:34.031
I guess so.

71
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:35.731
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:37.631
I think I'm a bit flustered at finding out

73
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:42.031
that the man with the burn wasn't Shu.

74
00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:43.731
I've got to shape up.

75
00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:45.831
What's the matter?

76
00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:48.031
Raising your voice suddenly like that.

77
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:50.931
Oh, no. It's nothing.

78
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:56.431
And how about it, Doc?

79
00:03:56.431 --> 00:04:00.431
Is the perp that you saw among the three?

80
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:06.831
Well, that old man with the cane is suspicious I guess,

81
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:11.231
but the perp had a thin stick about 30cm.

82
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.831
He wasn't using a cane, either.

83
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:15.931
The hat that the perp was wearing

84
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:17.931
was not a hunting cap that old people would wear

85
00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:20.031
or a knitted cap for women,

86
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.331
but rather, a mountain climbing hat.

87
00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:27.531
Besides, the perp didn't have a cough like that man.

88
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:31.731
But, maybe he's just pretending to have a cold?

89
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:33.731
I don't think so.

90
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.331
At the point we met him for the first time,

91
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:40.331
he had no way of knowing that we were acquaintances of Doc.

92
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:41.931
So, he wouldn't have needed to pretend

93
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.131
that he had a cold in front of us, right?

94
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.931
Well, I guess so.

95
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:51.231
Then Doctor, how about the style of walking?

96
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:56.131
You said the perp was dragging his legs a bit, no?

97
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:59.031
That old man, rather than drag his leg,

98
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:02.831
seems unable to stand without a cane.

99
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.831
The other two don't look to be dragging their legs either.

100
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:12.631
What? You can't find the murder weapon?

101
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:14.431
Did you look in every crevice and cranny?

102
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:17.331
Yes, sir. We looked inside the drain of the water spot,

103
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:20.331
and even inside the offertory box.

104
00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:23.131
Those three didn't have any, did they?

105
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.531
No! We even checked the old man's cane

106
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:28.131
but there were no traces of it having been used

107
00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:29.231
as a murder weapon.

108
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.531
Besides, we checked the cell phones of the three

109
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.731
but none of the cell phones had an application that enables

110
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:37.531
pursuit of a transmitter.

111
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:42.331
Maybe it was deleted to prevent us from finding it, though.

112
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:43.431
Yes.

113
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:47.531
But, to check any further, we need a warrant.

114
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:49.331
Hey, you guys!

115
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:53.631
When you met those three, did anyone of them act strange?

116
00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:55.631
Act strange?

117
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:57.531
For example, like somebody coming,

118
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:01.431
to secretly give them what looked to be a thin stick?

119
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.531
All three of them were by themselves!

120
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.631
The old man taught us to take home the oracle

121
00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.131
if the result was good too.

122
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:13.631
That lady told us to ring the bell loudly

123
00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:16.431
so that god could hear us!

124
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:18.031
The other man,

125
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:21.631
said that he already cleansed his hands at the water spot.

126
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.731
It seems he was at the shrine way

127
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:26.531
before we got here though.

128
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.531
Inspector Megure!

129
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:32.831
We found the hat and coat that could be the perp's!

130
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:34.831
Oh, is that so!

131
00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:36.431
There's probably no mistake about it,

132
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:38.531
because blood is splattered on it.

133
00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.931
But it's covered with flower petals.

134
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:44.431
Yes. It was covered with withered petals

135
00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:46.631
as if to hide it.

136
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:47.931
What?

137
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:51.231
Then, maybe the murder weapon is hidden in the same way!

138
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:53.731
Find it even if you have to scatter the flower petals!

139
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:55.431
Yes, sir!

140
00:06:56.431 --> 00:07:01.131
What? I mean it looks like a nice pink carpet, and yet!

141
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.531
True.

142
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:05.231
If you look at them one by one, they're flower petals,

143
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:06.831
and yet when many of them are scattered over the ground,

144
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.131
they look just like one pink carpet.

145
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:10.531
Yep.

146
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:14.531
I see. So, that's the story.

147
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:15.531
That's why that person

148
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:18.931
said something like that to the children.

149
00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:22.331
If so, the reason the perp was dragging his foot

150
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:24.631
was probably because...

151
00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:28.631
It seems that he got to the truth of the case but...

152
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:32.931
isn't aware of ours.

153
00:07:48.123 --> 00:07:50.923
Hey, how long do you intend to keep us stranded here?

154
00:07:50.923 --> 00:07:53.023
The sun's starting to set already!

155
00:07:53.023 --> 00:07:55.723
I don't know if you're working on a case or what but...

156
00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:58.123
It has nothing to do with us, right?

157
00:07:58.123 --> 00:08:01.623
We're very sorry. Please give us a little more time.

158
00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:03.323
Inspector Megure!

159
00:08:06.223 --> 00:08:09.723
We've got to open the doorways of the shrine already.

160
00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:11.023
I see.

161
00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.623
And, the murder weapon?

162
00:08:12.623 --> 00:08:16.723
Too bad, but we haven't got word that it's been found yet.

163
00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:19.823
Maybe the perp already fled this shrine

164
00:08:19.823 --> 00:08:22.923
and took the murder weapon along too.

165
00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:25.123
No, because taking into consideration,

166
00:08:25.123 --> 00:08:26.123
the time from when the incident occurred

167
00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:27.823
and entrance and exit were closed off,

168
00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:32.223
as well as the perp dragging his leg while leaving.

169
00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:33.923
It's highly likely that the perp

170
00:08:33.923 --> 00:08:36.523
is still on the grounds of this shrine!

171
00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:39.023
And that the stick that's about 30cm that Mr. Agasa witnessed

172
00:08:39.023 --> 00:08:43.323
the perp having, is hidden somewhere here too!

173
00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:45.623
If so, the most suspicious

174
00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:48.723
are those three victims of pickpocket.

175
00:08:48.723 --> 00:08:49.923
Yeah.

176
00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:52.223
If there was a GPS wrapped in the bills

177
00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:56.723
of the wallet of the pickpocket who was slugged to death...

178
00:08:56.723 --> 00:09:00.023
Just as Jodie mentioned, the suspect deliberately

179
00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:02.423
made the pickpocket steal the wallet with the GPS inside,

180
00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:06.523
in order to slug her to death in a lonely place.

181
00:09:06.523 --> 00:09:11.223
But, those three, don't look to have hurt their legs.

182
00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:13.923
Besides, the old man, rather than dragging his feet,

183
00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:16.523
cannot walk without his cane.

184
00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:19.723
And moreover, if the perp had an accomplice

185
00:09:19.723 --> 00:09:22.823
who he secretly passed the murder weapon onto,

186
00:09:22.823 --> 00:09:25.023
it would have to be one of the flower viewers here.

187
00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.323
We'd have to check all of them.

188
00:09:27.323 --> 00:09:29.823
That won't be necessary.

189
00:09:29.823 --> 00:09:34.023
The perp still has a part of the weapon hidden on him!

190
00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:35.523
A part of it?

191
00:09:35.523 --> 00:09:37.023
Oh, that's right!

192
00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:39.123
The perp bundled that stuff together

193
00:09:39.123 --> 00:09:40.923
and made the murder weapon!

194
00:09:40.923 --> 00:09:43.123
Bundled?

195
00:09:43.123 --> 00:09:44.923
The murder weapon that you saw, Mr. Agasa

196
00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:46.623
was a stick, wasn't it?

197
00:09:46.623 --> 00:09:48.323
What does bundle have to do with it?

198
00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:53.023
The perp bundled it into one. A lot of a certain thing!

199
00:09:53.023 --> 00:09:54.523
And, the perp hid it in a place where it

200
00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:56.123
wouldn't look suspicious

201
00:09:56.123 --> 00:09:58.823
even if there were a lot of it around.

202
00:09:58.823 --> 00:10:00.823
He called out to the children

203
00:10:00.823 --> 00:10:03.623
and nicely set up a camouflage too.

204
00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:06.523
-Huh? -You mean to us?

205
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.223
Then, are you talking about that old man

206
00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:10.823
who talked to us at the location where the oracles were tied?

207
00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:14.123
Come to think of it, there were a lot of oracles tied on,

208
00:10:14.123 --> 00:10:16.723
so no one would know the difference if more were added, right?

209
00:10:16.723 --> 00:10:19.423
But no matter how many oracles you bundle together,

210
00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:20.623
you could never make a murder weapon

211
00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:23.223
enough to slug a person to death with.

212
00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:25.423
It's only paper after all.

213
00:10:25.423 --> 00:10:27.223
Then, is it that man?

214
00:10:27.223 --> 00:10:28.423
The one who said he didn't need the scoopers

215
00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:32.223
that Genta handed to him at the water spot.

216
00:10:32.223 --> 00:10:34.923
I'm sure it was him!

217
00:10:34.923 --> 00:10:38.523
There were many scoopers at the water spot too!

218
00:10:38.523 --> 00:10:42.623
If there was a scooper made of iron among them...

219
00:10:42.623 --> 00:10:46.423
The police would've found it long ago.

220
00:10:46.423 --> 00:10:47.923
I guess so.

221
00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:50.923
Of course there was no such scoopers.

222
00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:53.523
The only one left is that lady we saw at the place

223
00:10:53.523 --> 00:10:55.923
to ring the bell.

224
00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:59.623
But, there were only two bells!

225
00:10:59.623 --> 00:11:03.123
Didn't you guys do something before you rang the bell?

226
00:11:03.923 --> 00:11:06.323
-I see! -We threw in money offering.

227
00:11:06.323 --> 00:11:08.323
We put in 5 yen coins!

228
00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:10.123
Inside the offertory box!

229
00:11:10.123 --> 00:11:13.423
Right. Offerings usually made by throwing in 5 yen coins,

230
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.823
because they symbolize "goen" meaning good ties with others.

231
00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:17.923
That's why most of the coins are 5 yen coins with holes in them!

232
00:11:17.923 --> 00:11:19.423
I see.

233
00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:21.723
If you join all the coins by pulling a string or wire

234
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.623
through them and bundle them together,

235
00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:25.523
you can make a thin long stick.

236
00:11:25.523 --> 00:11:28.123
On top of that, even if a lot of 5 yen coins

237
00:11:28.123 --> 00:11:31.723
were to later be found in the offertory box,

238
00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:33.023
they would be mixed with other monetary offerings

239
00:11:33.023 --> 00:11:34.423
so it wouldn't look suspicious.

240
00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:36.623
The perp can deceive the eyes of the police

241
00:11:36.623 --> 00:11:39.623
who are set on looking for a thin long metal stick!

242
00:11:39.623 --> 00:11:43.023
But in order to make a stick as long as 30cm,

243
00:11:43.023 --> 00:11:45.823
you'll need around 200 five yen coins.

244
00:11:45.823 --> 00:11:49.223
Besides, if you throw in that many coins at once,

245
00:11:49.223 --> 00:11:51.923
the people around will get suspicious, won't they?

246
00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:56.023
That's why the perp called out to the children

247
00:11:56.023 --> 00:11:58.623
and told them that unless they ring the bell loudly,

248
00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:00.723
god won't hear them.

249
00:12:00.723 --> 00:12:02.423
Then...

250
00:12:02.423 --> 00:12:04.323
The perp is...

251
00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:05.623
That's right.

252
00:12:05.623 --> 00:12:08.923
The one who hid a GPS transmitter into the wallet

253
00:12:08.923 --> 00:12:10.923
to confirm the whereabouts of the pickpocket,

254
00:12:10.923 --> 00:12:12.323
then used a lot of 5 yen coins by bundling them

255
00:12:12.323 --> 00:12:14.623
into the form of a stick to make the murder weapon,

256
00:12:14.623 --> 00:12:16.623
then finally slugged Ms. Ikuyo Yatani,

257
00:12:16.623 --> 00:12:21.123
so-called pickpocket Kurobei, to death is...

258
00:12:21.123 --> 00:12:22.723
you!

259
00:12:43.136 --> 00:12:44.836
Then...

260
00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:46.436
The perp is...

261
00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:47.736
That's right.

262
00:12:47.736 --> 00:12:51.136
The one who hid a GPS transmitter into the wallet

263
00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:53.136
to confirm the whereabouts of the pickpocket,

264
00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:54.536
then used a lot of 5 yen coins by bundling them

265
00:12:54.536 --> 00:12:56.836
into the form of a stick to make the murder weapon,

266
00:12:56.836 --> 00:12:58.736
then finally slugged Ms. Ikuyo Yatani,

267
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:02.736
so-called pickpocket Kurobei, to death is...

268
00:13:02.736 --> 00:13:04.536
you!

269
00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:06.336
Ms. Yoriko Danno!

270
00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:08.836
You called out to the children

271
00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:11.636
and made them ring the bell very loudly,

272
00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:14.736
and erased the sound of the load of 5 yen coins

273
00:13:14.736 --> 00:13:17.636
being put into the offertory box!

274
00:13:17.636 --> 00:13:19.036
You untied the tip of the string

275
00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:21.036
that bundled the 5 yen coins together,

276
00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:22.536
held the edge of the string

277
00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:25.036
and hung it down in the offertory box.

278
00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:29.336
In this way you slid the load of coins into the box at once.

279
00:13:29.336 --> 00:13:32.136
Moreover, the murder was committed

280
00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:34.436
before you rang the bell.

281
00:13:34.436 --> 00:13:36.536
Although by then your wallet

282
00:13:36.536 --> 00:13:39.136
should've been pickpocketed by the victim.

283
00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:41.436
You lied saying that you weren't aware this,

284
00:13:41.436 --> 00:13:43.936
threw money into the offertory box and rang the bell.

285
00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:45.336
This is proof that you're the one who did it!

286
00:13:45.336 --> 00:13:46.936
True.

287
00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:48.836
You should've noticed that you'd been pickpocketed

288
00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:51.636
at the time you opened your wallet to throw in the offering.

289
00:13:51.636 --> 00:13:53.836
Oh my, don't you know?

290
00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:55.436
A saying goes that one should not open their wallet

291
00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:58.536
in front of the offertory box.

292
00:13:58.536 --> 00:14:01.136
If god sees the contents of your wallet,

293
00:14:01.136 --> 00:14:02.536
and finds that you have a lot,

294
00:14:02.536 --> 00:14:06.536
but are only giving a small offering, you may enrage him.

295
00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:09.336
That's why when I come to visit the shrine

296
00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:11.936
I keep 5 yen coins as is, in my pocket!

297
00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:15.536
I see. That's why you say you didn't realize

298
00:14:15.536 --> 00:14:17.536
that your wallet was gone?

299
00:14:17.536 --> 00:14:19.136
That's right!

300
00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:22.036
Well, if you saw me putting a load of 5 yen coins

301
00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.536
into the offertory box,

302
00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:26.836
I wouldn't mind admitting it, though.

303
00:14:26.836 --> 00:14:29.536
We don't have to see it to prove it.

304
00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:34.236
So long as we check that shoelace of yours.

305
00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:41.436
You probably used your shoelace

306
00:14:41.436 --> 00:14:44.536
to bundle the 5 yen coins together.

307
00:14:44.536 --> 00:14:48.736
That's why you couldn't leave the site right away.

308
00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:51.236
Because you were missing one of your shoelaces,

309
00:14:51.236 --> 00:14:54.936
your shoe would come off if you walked the way you usually do.

310
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.536
After ringing the bell,

311
00:14:56.536 --> 00:15:00.136
it seems you put your shoelace back on and re-tied it.

312
00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:03.736
If you used that shoelace to commit the crime,

313
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:06.136
it should be there...

314
00:15:06.136 --> 00:15:08.436
the blood of the victim that splattered

315
00:15:08.436 --> 00:15:11.536
when you slugged her to death.

316
00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:17.836
Excuse me.

317
00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.436
It's here.

318
00:15:22.436 --> 00:15:24.136
Blood stains.

319
00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:30.336
But, why did you have extra 5 yen coins on you?

320
00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:33.136
Weren't the 5 yen coins found near the corpse

321
00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:34.836
the ones that were put in your pocket

322
00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:37.636
when your wallet was pickpocketed?

323
00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:42.736
Those were the ones I showed you police a while ago.

324
00:15:42.736 --> 00:15:45.436
Then, what about those 5 yen coins?

325
00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.536
I put it near that woman because those coins

326
00:15:48.536 --> 00:15:51.536
were the ones that woman put into my wallet

327
00:15:51.536 --> 00:15:54.536
when she pickpocketed me last year.

328
00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:57.636
The 5 yen coins that took the life of my son!

329
00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:00.236
Son...

330
00:16:00.236 --> 00:16:02.236
You mean the one that was in the photo

331
00:16:02.236 --> 00:16:04.336
that was in your wallet?

332
00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:08.536
Yes. That's right.

333
00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:11.536
When I was pickpocketed last year,

334
00:16:11.536 --> 00:16:13.936
my car keys were also in my wallet.

335
00:16:13.936 --> 00:16:17.136
And, because I didn't have the keys, my son who had asthma

336
00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:19.836
was locked in the car for several hours.

337
00:16:19.836 --> 00:16:22.236
We got to the hospital too late

338
00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:25.436
and as a result, he died.

339
00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:30.436
So, I checked everywhere on the internet about that pickpocket

340
00:16:30.436 --> 00:16:34.136
and ambushed her in places that she was prone to appear.

341
00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:36.836
But, why the photo?

342
00:16:36.836 --> 00:16:38.936
If it hadn't been in your wallet,

343
00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:42.536
we might not have known it was yours.

344
00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:45.336
If you try to take money out of the wallet,

345
00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:48.936
that photo would jump into your eyes, wouldn't it?

346
00:16:48.936 --> 00:16:51.036
I wanted to let her know

347
00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:53.536
that when she pickpocketed back then,

348
00:16:53.536 --> 00:16:57.136
she not only took my money.

349
00:16:57.136 --> 00:17:01.736
But, also took the life of a little boy as well.

350
00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:09.936
Then, may I go home already?

351
00:17:09.936 --> 00:17:11.036
Yes.

352
00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:12.736
I'll be going too, then.

353
00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:14.836
We're still working on the pickpocket case,

354
00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:18.236
so we may ask you some question at a later date though.

355
00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:20.136
Oh, that's okay with me.

356
00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:21.736
Please contact me.

357
00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:24.036
Uh, sir!

358
00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:26.936
Do you have bad eyes, sir?

359
00:17:26.936 --> 00:17:28.736
Huh? Why do you ask?

360
00:17:28.736 --> 00:17:30.536
Because that lady pickpocket

361
00:17:30.536 --> 00:17:33.236
saw your face and looked really surprised.

362
00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:35.636
I think that was because

363
00:17:35.636 --> 00:17:39.036
she just pickpocketed your wallet a while ago.

364
00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:42.136
Why didn't you say anything back then, sir?

365
00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:44.736
In spite it being the second time you saw her.

366
00:17:44.736 --> 00:17:46.636
Right.

367
00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:48.636
I've got bad eyesight, you see.

368
00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:51.136
If you got bad eyes, you can't view the cherry blossoms

369
00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.936
unless you wear glasses!

370
00:17:52.936 --> 00:17:55.236
Did you come to view flowers alone?

371
00:17:55.236 --> 00:17:57.836
Actually I came to get lucky charms.

372
00:17:57.836 --> 00:18:00.836
What kind of lucky charms?

373
00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:03.036
For me, right?

374
00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:05.436
Motoe?

375
00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:10.036
For this child.

376
00:18:10.036 --> 00:18:11.736
I see, a baby.

377
00:18:11.736 --> 00:18:14.236
A charm to help assist a safe birth, eh?

378
00:18:14.236 --> 00:18:17.036
I told you to stay still at home, didn't I?

379
00:18:17.036 --> 00:18:19.836
I came to check on you, because you didn't come home

380
00:18:19.836 --> 00:18:21.336
and I got worried!

381
00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:23.736
Then, could you by chance be...

382
00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:28.336
the one who masking taped me during the bank robbery?

383
00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:31.536
Oh, you're that non-Japanese person that was there?

384
00:18:31.536 --> 00:18:33.236
I'm sorry for what I did then,

385
00:18:33.236 --> 00:18:36.536
I was threatened, and had no choice.

386
00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:42.636
Are you all right?

387
00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:53.836
I'm sorry, Motoe doesn't seem to be feeling well,

388
00:18:53.836 --> 00:18:55.736
so could we leave?

389
00:18:55.736 --> 00:18:57.736
Huh? Yes.

390
00:19:00.036 --> 00:19:01.936
Morning sickness is a symptom that seen

391
00:19:01.936 --> 00:19:03.536
during the early stages of pregnancy, right?

392
00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:06.236
Yeah. But the size of her stomach

393
00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:09.136
looked big enough to be six months pregnant.

394
00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:13.636
Well, she could be feeling nausea for some other reason too.

395
00:19:13.636 --> 00:19:15.736
Yes, that's right, Camel.

396
00:19:15.736 --> 00:19:19.136
That man with the burn, wasn't Shu, I guess.

397
00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.236
He seemed to have been just a decoy sent out

398
00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.436
by the Organization

399
00:19:23.436 --> 00:19:25.536
to confirm whether Shu really died or not.

400
00:19:25.536 --> 00:19:27.836
Oh, Jodie.

401
00:19:27.836 --> 00:19:32.236
Anyway, I'll give you the details after I get back there, okay?

402
00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:34.536
I think the cash has been taken,

403
00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:36.836
but please confirm the contents of the wallet.

404
00:19:36.836 --> 00:19:38.336
Yes.

405
00:19:40.236 --> 00:19:42.536
All my cards are intact

406
00:19:42.536 --> 00:19:44.636
and the contents of my pocket.

407
00:19:46.136 --> 00:19:49.736
This is... back during the department hijacking.

408
00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:57.436
Huh? The edge of the coaster is bent.

409
00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:03.536
Run for it! This area is dangerous.

410
00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:07.036
Shu!

411
00:20:08.736 --> 00:20:10.136
Shu!

412
00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:12.636
Shu.

413
00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:18.436
If that man with the burn isn't Shu...

414
00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:22.336
Who on earth's doing this? For what?

415
00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:27.436
I'm sorry, Agent Jodie.

416
00:21:54.536 --> 00:21:56.636
Hey, you.

417
00:21:56.636 --> 00:21:59.736
You'll catch cold sleeping in a place like...

418
00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:02.136
Huh?

419
00:22:02.136 --> 00:22:04.036
Hey, you?

420
00:22:04.036 --> 00:22:07.636
Don't worry! He's just drunk and sleeping.

421
00:22:07.636 --> 00:22:08.636
Huh?

422
00:22:08.636 --> 00:22:10.736
My big brother's not a strong drinker.

423
00:22:10.736 --> 00:22:11.836
Huh?

424
00:22:11.836 --> 00:22:14.536
Twins?

425
00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:22.036
What an incident that was?

426
00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:23.736
To think that the man you disguised yourself as

427
00:22:23.736 --> 00:22:26.036
was pickpocketed.

428
00:22:26.036 --> 00:22:28.236
I did think something was strange

429
00:22:28.236 --> 00:22:30.836
because he didn't have a wallet, though.

430
00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:34.936
Well, it was good for me that I took the queer 5 yen coins

431
00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:37.536
that the man had on him.

432
00:22:37.536 --> 00:22:40.236
But, to go out of the way to return the wallet

433
00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:42.736
that was pickpocketed back to him.

434
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:45.636
I didn't want him to make a big fuss later!

435
00:22:45.636 --> 00:22:46.636
Because there was a cash card

436
00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:48.736
and driver's license inside too, you know.

437
00:22:48.736 --> 00:22:51.636
Well, you'd better be grateful.

438
00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:56.036
When that kitty cat of the FBI grabbed your arm,

439
00:22:56.036 --> 00:22:59.636
the wiretap that you put into the fold of her sleeve,

440
00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:02.236
I made sure I retrieved it for you.

441
00:23:02.236 --> 00:23:04.136
Thank you.

442
00:23:04.136 --> 00:23:07.536
And?

443
00:23:07.536 --> 00:23:11.236
From that kitty cat,

444
00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:13.636
did you get to listen to any good stories?

445
00:23:13.636 --> 00:23:17.936
Yes. I got a lot of what I wanted.

446
00:23:17.936 --> 00:23:19.136
I got to hear unexpected stories

447
00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:20.536
that went on behind the scenes too besides.

448
00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:25.336
I hope I get to hear the rest of that story from you.

449
00:23:25.336 --> 00:23:28.736
Yes, as soon as I get solid proof, I will.

450
00:23:28.736 --> 00:23:31.736
But, let me just tell you this.

451
00:23:33.436 --> 00:23:36.036
He's a dreadfully intelligent man.

452
00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:41.336
That young man.

453
00:23:43.536 --> 00:23:48.236
So, you're not convinced of Kogoro's deduction after all?

454
00:23:48.236 --> 00:23:49.836
I see!

455
00:23:49.836 --> 00:23:51.936
That's what that left hand meant.

456
00:23:52.936 --> 00:23:56.236
Oh no! I've got to let her know right away!

457
00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.536
This is bad!

458
00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:06.336
Kaori!

459
00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:13.036
