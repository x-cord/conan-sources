1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,340
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,340
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,940
Even if you put a lot of money in the offertory box,

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,740
your prayer won't be answered if it's for no good.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,353
In the middle of the night

9
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:06,253
at 2:15 am,

10
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,253
when everyone was fast asleep,

11
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,553
the earth shook violently.

12
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:20,853
"Earthquake in the Dead of Night, West of Tokyo"

13
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:32,553
Last night's earthquake was a big one.

14
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:37,753
What in the world...

15
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,053
Hey, are you all right?

16
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,553
The bell?

17
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:50,653
Last night's earthquake must have caused the bell to fall

18
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,553
and hit him on the head.

19
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:57,353
Someone was trying to break into the offertory box.

20
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,953
It must have been this fellow.

21
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:10,953
"Strange Punishment"

22
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:13,853
Someone tried to steal the offerings?

23
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,953
Yes, this morning at Teitan Shrine.

24
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:20,653
I bet he's really going to be punished.

25
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:25,953
Listen, why don't we go and catch the guy?

26
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,553
No, wait!

27
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:30,653
The thief has already been caught.

28
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:33,453
What do you mean?

29
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:38,053
That sucks.

30
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:41,553
Then, just like that he was arrested by the police.

31
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:45,653
So, you should always listen to the whole story, Genta.

32
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,553
I guess coincidences like that do happen.

33
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,653
The earthquake struck

34
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,253
while he was trying to steal the money.

35
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:57,053
Then, the "garan garan" fell on his head...

36
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,553
and he got knocked out.

37
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:02,753
What's a "garan garan"?

38
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,353
Good grief, Conan,

39
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,953
that's what they call the shrine bell. Didn't you know that?

40
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:09,553
Don't tell me you didn't even know that.

41
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,153
Oh, I see.

42
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,953
Heaven certainly has punished him.

43
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:18,053
That's why you shouldn't do bad things.

44
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:23,753
He certainly was an unlucky thief, wasn't he?

45
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:26,253
Yes, what a loser.

46
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:29,153
Don't you think so too, Conan?

47
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:30,353
Conan?

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:35,653
Why do you think thief chose this small shrine?

49
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:38,053
Huh? What do you mean?

50
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:40,053
Just look at this place.

51
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,753
But what am I going do?

52
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:45,653
There's no money for the repairs.

53
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,153
Even if he managed to get the offertory box open,

54
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:52,753
it doesn't look like there'd be much inside, does it?

55
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,253
I see what you mean.

56
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,253
I'd understand him trying to rob Beika Shrine

57
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:00,053
because a lot more people go to pray there.

58
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:03,453
Maybe he didn't know about Beika Shrine.

59
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:07,453
That's right, I bet he's from some place far away.

60
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:08,653
Let's forget about it.

61
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:12,453
There might be other cases to solve because of the earthquake.

62
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,253
You're right, here might be other people who need our help!

63
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:17,753
Then, we shouldn't let them down!

64
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:21,953
All right. Youth Detective Squad, let's get to work!

65
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:23,253
-Let's go! -Let's go!

66
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:34,253
What was that?

67
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,353
A scream?

68
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:38,353
Takeo, what's the matter?

69
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:39,853
Talk to me, Mr. Takeo!

70
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,453
Takeo!

71
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:46,253
Takeo, don't die!

72
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:50,353
Takeo!

73
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:51,953
Genta, call an ambulance!

74
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,353
Okay!

75
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,753
Takeo, are you okay?

76
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:57,953
Takeo!

77
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,253
I see.

78
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:03,653
So, you two are getting married next month.

79
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:07,253
Yes, he and I were supposed to go to our "nakodo's" home today,

80
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:09,853
but he didn't arrive when he said he would.

81
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:13,953
I tried calling him several time but there was no answer.

82
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:17,453
So you came here because you were worried.

83
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,353
Yes. When I got here, he was on the floor.

84
00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:22,153
And I was so scared.

85
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:24,553
How is your head?

86
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:27,053
Luckily I suffered just a minor concussion

87
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,353
and the X-rays shows no brain damage.

88
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,553
I see.

89
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:35,453
Then, I'd like to get all the details Mr. Takenaka.

90
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:36,853
Please tell me about the attack.

91
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,853
Of course. I had a meeting to attend last night.

92
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:43,353
So I got back late, it was about 2:30 am,

93
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,953
after the earthquake.

94
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,453
Goodness.

95
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,353
What a mess.

96
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,353
That earthquake sure shook things up.

97
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:56,253
This is terrible.

98
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,853
Who are you?

99
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,753
Stop!

100
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:05,053
You're not getting away!

101
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:16,253
This can't be happening. Is he dead?

102
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,253
I don't believe this!

103
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,553
Come back here...

104
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:25,953
You're saying that

105
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:30,553
he ran away because he thought he killed you?

106
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,653
Probably.

107
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,853
But I was only knocked unconscious.

108
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,553
What a panicky fellow.

109
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:40,353
That's the second loser today.

110
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,953
You're so right.

111
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:43,953
And was there anything stolen?

112
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:47,553
The 200,000 yen I had in the chest was taken.

113
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:49,253
All he took was the cash?

114
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,253
Yes.

115
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,653
This is going to be difficult.

116
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,753
Cash is hard to trace.

117
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:58,853
Excuse me, does that mean he won't be caught?

118
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:02,753
Don't worry, you can rest at ease.

119
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,253
If we find his fingerprints, he's as good as caught.

120
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,853
He was wearing gloves...

121
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,753
I guess I'll start by questioning the neighbors first.

122
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,753
Hello, Officer Takagi.

123
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:23,753
Officer Otani, what're you doing here?

124
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,753
We're going over the crime scene.

125
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,753
At Teitan Shrine over there.

126
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:31,253
Oh, yes. I heard about that offertory thief.

127
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:33,053
"Rokusuke Urasawa (35)"

128
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:37,053
That's the stupid thief.

129
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,253
He does look stupid.

130
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,153
You shouldn't say such things, it's not nice.

131
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:47,353
His name's Urasawa, he lives on 4th chome just down the street.

132
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,253
4th chome?

133
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,353
He's a real coward but he just won't stop stealing.

134
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,953
He's been arrested twice before for breaking and entering.

135
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,053
I guess we've both got unpleasant work to do.

136
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,353
I'm working on a burglary.

137
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,053
Huh?

138
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,853
Is something wrong?

139
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:06,853
Oh, no. It's nothing.

140
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,053
But seeings as they've got Officer Takagi

141
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:12,753
from the head office on the case,

142
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,553
I'm sure you'll get it wrapped up in no time.

143
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:21,053
Well, I've got to be going.

144
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:22,853
I'll see you later.

145
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:27,353
I hope he's right.

146
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:34,653
Well, I'd better go look for witnesses.

147
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:42,253
I'd really like to help Officer Takagi solve the case.

148
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,853
Right, especially since I heard he messed up last time

149
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:46,753
and was punished.

150
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,553
Don't worry.

151
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,353
This case is simple since there's no trick to it.

152
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,453
Isn't that right, Conan?

153
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,353
Conan?

154
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:59,153
What are you doing, Conan?

155
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:02,053
I knew it, something's fishy.

156
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,553
What's fishy?

157
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:07,153
About that offertory thief Urasawa.

158
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:09,953
Take a good look at this map.

159
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:13,753
4th chome is right next to Beika Shrine.

160
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:16,853
He lives so close and yet he chose to rob Teitan Shrine

161
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:19,653
which is much farther away and are unpopular.

162
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,653
It's just not logical, is it?

163
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,353
Who cares about that?

164
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:26,953
He got punished by heaven for trying to steal from that old shrine,

165
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:29,253
so what's the big deal?

166
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,853
Punished by heaven?

167
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:32,753
The "garan garan".

168
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:37,253
They usually don't fall even in an earthquake, you know.

169
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,753
No way...

170
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:40,853
No. If you think about it that way,

171
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:44,653
then that'll be reason enough to choose that place.

172
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,853
And if that is the case...

173
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:50,253
Hey, Conan!

174
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,853
It should be here...

175
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,853
If my theory is right,

176
00:10:56,853 --> 00:11:00,453
it should be somewhere between there and Teitan Shrine.

177
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:09,153
What's the matter, Conan?

178
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:10,853
Why did you run off like that all of a sudden?

179
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:11,953
I found it!

180
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,153
Conan!

181
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:16,353
Is that what I think it is?

182
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:18,753
Yes. It might be so.

183
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:20,253
I'm pretty sure

184
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,853
these belong to whoever attacked Mr. Takenaka.

185
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,353
Good work, Conan! Bravo!

186
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,953
We've got to let Officer Takagi know right away!

187
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,453
Yes, let's go.

188
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,853
But the money isn't here

189
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:38,153
and I doubt he has it on him.

190
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:41,253
I see.

191
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,953
It's in there!

192
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:47,753
Come on, mister. Hurry up, please.

193
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:49,453
I was going to put some money in

194
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:52,653
but I threw my favorite badge in by mistake.

195
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,253
All right, I understand.

196
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,553
I'll get it open soon.

197
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,153
What is this?

198
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,353
There it is!

199
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:08,453
Thank you very much.

200
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:11,653
Look at all that! Aren't you lucky, mister?

201
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:16,453
There's so much money in here.

202
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:18,653
This has never happened before.

203
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:29,353
How was it, Officer Takagi?

204
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:31,253
Yes, there's no mistake about it.

205
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:35,053
That money was stolen from Mr. Takenaka's home.

206
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:38,553
His fingerprints were on them.

207
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:39,953
I knew it.

208
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:41,853
And we also found fingerprints

209
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:44,553
from somebody very unexpected on them.

210
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,553
Who are you talking about?

211
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:49,753
That offertory thief, Urasawa.

212
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:52,953
So that means he stole the money!

213
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:55,053
What a bad guy.

214
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,253
Wait just a minute, Genta.

215
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:02,353
Mr. Takenaka was attacked at about 2:30, isn't that right?

216
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,353
Yes.

217
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:07,153
Huh? But the earthquake was at 2:15 am, wasn't it?

218
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,853
That's right.

219
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:13,053
But at 2:30, that man was already unconscious at the shrine.

220
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,253
That's right!

221
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,553
The "garan garan" hit him on the head

222
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:19,253
and he should have been unconscious by then!

223
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:20,453
That's right.

224
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:23,553
It's impossible for an unconscious person

225
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,253
to be breaking into another place.

226
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,653
I don't understand it at all.

227
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:46,061
I just can't figure it out.

228
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,961
I thought it was just a simple burglary.

229
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:53,561
Officer Takagi...

230
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,761
Officer Takagi, excuse me.

231
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,561
Why don't you ask Inspector Megure to help you?

232
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:03,661
I think that would be best.

233
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,761
You've got to be kidding.

234
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,361
I can handle a case like this myself, just you watch!

235
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:10,961
But...

236
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,261
What do you think, Conan?

237
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:13,761
Huh? Conan?

238
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,061
-Conan? -Huh?

239
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:21,861
Yes, Takagi here.

240
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,261
Inspector Megure!

241
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:28,161
Well, truth is, Inspector Megure...

242
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:30,961
I don't want to hear any feeble excuses!

243
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:34,461
Officer Otani called me just now and gave me all the details.

244
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,261
Listen here, Officer Takagi.

245
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,861
This is where you show us what you can do.

246
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,661
Don't lose your confidence!

247
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,261
But, Inspector Megure...

248
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,561
You're a top notch detective.

249
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:48,461
I know that better than anyone else.

250
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:52,261
You just lack self-confidence, that's all.

251
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,061
Self-confidence?

252
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,961
That 's right, self-confidence.

253
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,061
You can solve this case. I know you can.

254
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,261
Take pride in yourself, Officer Takagi!

255
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,761
Yes, sir!

256
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:05,161
Good! I'll be waiting to hear good news from you.

257
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:06,461
Inspector Megure!

258
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:09,761
Thank you very much, sir!

259
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,661
Hey, what happened to Officer Takagi?

260
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,961
He's so happy all of a sudden.

261
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:18,261
He just got a call from Inspector Megure!

262
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,261
He told Officer Takagi to do his best.

263
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,161
I see.

264
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,061
Hey, Detective Takagi.

265
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,461
What is it?

266
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:28,161
Are you sure that guy Urasawa got knocked unconscious

267
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,661
at 2:15?

268
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,161
Huh?

269
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,761
What are you talking about?

270
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:37,261
That's when the earthquake occurred, right?

271
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:41,661
That's when the "garan garan" fell and hit him on the head.

272
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:44,761
But nobody saw it happen, right?

273
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,461
You're right. We've only got his word for it.

274
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,161
That's right.

275
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,161
Okay!

276
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,461
Let's find out what Urasawa was doing

277
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,861
at around the time of the attack.

278
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,961
We'll go about it on the assumption he was the one

279
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,661
who attacked Mr. Takenaka.

280
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,961
Okay!

281
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,761
Urasawa hated to work

282
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,361
and he was completely broke.

283
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:17,361
So he decided to steal some money.

284
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:22,261
He walked around looking for a place to break into.

285
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:30,361
Then, he decided to break into Mr. Takenaka's place.

286
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:33,561
I wonder why he chose this house though.

287
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,261
There's so many other houses around here.

288
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,561
Why? It was probably because nobody was home.

289
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:41,961
But if it was in the middle of the night,

290
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,861
so he wouldn't know if the house was empty

291
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,561
or if everyone was asleep, would he?

292
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:47,761
Well, that's...

293
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:49,761
He probably just took a chance.

294
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:53,161
That's right, who cares about that anyway?

295
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,061
No, it is important.

296
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,361
He must have had a reason.

297
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:01,461
He must have.

298
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,561
He's right.

299
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:05,161
There's got to be a good reason for it.

300
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:07,361
I don't get it.

301
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:12,161
How did Urasawa know no one was home in Mr. Takenaka's house?

302
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,661
Come on, Officer Takagi, think.

303
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:18,461
Did something happen in that house at that time?

304
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,761
No. No one was home, so nothing could have happened.

305
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,961
That's it!

306
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,261
The earthquake!

307
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,361
The earthquake occurred

308
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:33,761
just when Urasawa was passing by the house!

309
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,861
The strong earthquake occurred in the middle of the night.

310
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,761
It would've woken everybody up.

311
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:40,361
They would have been scared and turned on their lights.

312
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,761
But only Mr. Takenaka's home remained dark.

313
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:50,461
And realizing no one was home, he broke in.

314
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:55,361
But while he was looking for things to steal,

315
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,861
Mr. Takenaka came home.

316
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,361
Goodness.

317
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,261
What a mess.

318
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,461
That earthquake sure shook things up.

319
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:06,261
This is terrible.

320
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,561
Who's there?

321
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,561
Stop!

322
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,161
You're not getting away!

323
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:23,061
This can't be happening. Is he dead?

324
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,861
I don't believe this!

325
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:29,561
Urasawa thought he killed Mr. Takenaka,

326
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,261
he panicked and ran away.

327
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:35,761
He had to find a place to get rid

328
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,461
of the mask and gloves quickly.

329
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,861
He saw the garbage collection area,

330
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:44,861
so he throws them away there.

331
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:46,861
So that they wouldn't be found.

332
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,761
Criminals are very nervous at times like that, right?

333
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,461
I'm pretty sure they are.

334
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:53,761
He's actually a very timid man.

335
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,561
And although he just made the wrong assumption

336
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,161
by thinking that he committed murder.

337
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,861
He must have been in a panic.

338
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,761
He knew that the police would get high and low

339
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:06,061
for him now that the charge was murder,

340
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,361
and he didn't have an alibi.

341
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,161
Yes.

342
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:13,161
Alibi?

343
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:14,861
Alibi.

344
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,361
I'm pretty sure he would have thought

345
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,561
if only he could come up with an alibi!

346
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:27,861
That's right!

347
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:30,161
That's when Urasawa found it!

348
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,361
He saw the bell on the ground.

349
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:38,561
And he decided to make himself look like an offering thief.

350
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,161
In other words, he staged it.

351
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,361
What I'm trying to say is, his goal wasn't to steal the money,

352
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:49,261
It was actually to get caught trying to stealing it.

353
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:50,761
That way, he'd have an alibi for the time

354
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,761
where he thought Mr. Takenaka was killed.

355
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,961
I get it!

356
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,961
Officer Takagi, that was brilliant!

357
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,561
See, you can do it if you try!

358
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,761
But...

359
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:07,161
Why did he put the money he worked so hard to steal

360
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:08,661
inside the offertory box?

361
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,861
He didn't have a choice.

362
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,261
No one would believe he was an offertory thief

363
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:16,461
if he had 200,000 yen in his pocket.

364
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,761
Oh, I get it.

365
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:21,161
And besides, maybe...

366
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,561
I just killed somebody.

367
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,161
But I don't want to stay in prison for who knows how long.

368
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:35,261
Please. Oh please, God.

369
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,461
Please help me!

370
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:41,461
Maybe he prayed to God for help.

371
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,661
-Prayed to God? -Prayed to God?

372
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:45,361
It's possible!

373
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:48,161
She's right, he might have.

374
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:52,161
It just goes to prove how desperate he was.

375
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,361
And then he...

376
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,661
It went exactly like you said.

377
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:15,261
Officer Takagi!

378
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,161
What you're saying

379
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,161
is that you tried to hide one crime

380
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,561
by committing another crime, is that it?

381
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,961
Other people would think the same thing, wouldn't they?

382
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,261
I mean it's much better to be arrested

383
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:27,361
for something small like minor theft

384
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:32,261
than to be arrested for something big like murder.

385
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:33,661
Don't you think so?

386
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:35,261
You idiot!

387
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,461
Listen, Urasawa.

388
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:41,661
There's no such thing as a small crime or a big crime.

389
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:42,861
A crime is a crime

390
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:44,761
and the perpetrator shall always be punished!

391
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,961
Yes, you're right.

392
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,561
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:23,961
Hey, Takagi!

394
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,761
Oh, Inspector Megure!

395
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:29,261
I hear you did a good job solving the case.

396
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,461
Inspector Megure!

397
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,461
I've gained a lot of confidence from this experience,

398
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,661
now I know I can do my job well!

399
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,961
I'm glad to hear that...

400
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,761
I owe it all to you since you encouraged me!

401
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,761
Thank you very much!

402
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:41,961
Huh?

403
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,161
I'll see you later, Inspector Megure.

404
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,661
What was he talking about anyway?

405
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:58,761
Don't be shy, you thoughtful boss you.

406
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,661
-Don't be shy. -You thoughtful boss.

407
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:04,361
Well, at least, everything's worked out, right?

408
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,061
"Next Episode"

409
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:15,461
and went to go eat with his friend?

410
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:16,961
No way.

411
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:20,261
No, I don't think he forgot.

412
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:25,561
It's most likely that he got himself mixed up in something.

413
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,261
Look at this strap!

414
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,061
Next Conan,

415
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Man from Chicago (Part 1)"

416
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,679
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,079
"Strap"

418
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,279
In next week's episode,

419
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,379
an interesting international man makes an appearance!

420
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:44,879
Don't miss it!
