1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.640
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.740
Is Tokyo a weak point for the detective of the West?

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.840
His life is at stake and are forced to send out an SOS!

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.367
Is it here, Kazuha?

9
00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.067
No. It's not there, Heiji.

10
00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:51.767
More to the left.

11
00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:53.667
Left?

12
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.167
Is it around here?

13
00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:56.267
It hurts!

14
00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:57.767
Where do you stick it at, Heiji?

15
00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.667
I told you it's to the left.

16
00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.167
You fool! Keep your voice down.

17
00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.267
They will hear us.

18
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.767
Darn it.

19
00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.167
The safety pin went into the slit in the floor.

20
00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:17.467
You're so clumsy!

21
00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:20.467
You can't get rid of this cuff without it.

22
00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.467
Don't you have anything else? Like a wire?

23
00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.167
No, that's the only thing I got.

24
00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:27.867
Darn it.

25
00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:32.167
Well, maybe it's better if we try solve this cipher.

26
00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.967
They said if we solve it, they'd release us.

27
00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:36.967
That's right!

28
00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:44.467
If you want to go out and see the sun,

29
00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:48.667
solve it quickly or...

30
00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:52.467
Mr. Kusukawa?

31
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:56.267
You will be as cold as he is.

32
00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:01.367
Heiji.

33
00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:02.967
Don't worry.

34
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.867
They don't know...

35
00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.667
that we have him.

36
00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.967
Who do you mean by him?

37
00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:12.467
Yes.

38
00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:13.867
I'm sure of it.

39
00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:18.067
I'm sure he will find us.

40
00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:25.767
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 1)"

41
00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:28.767
"Mouri Detective Agency"

42
00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:33.267
They're late.

43
00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:35.567
Heiji and Kazuha.

44
00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.267
Yes.

45
00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:40.567
The date was at 1:00 pm, but it's 2:00 pm already.

46
00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.267
I wonder if anything happened.

47
00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.967
Then, why don't you call them?

48
00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:47.167
They carry a cell phone, don't they?

49
00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.667
I called them, but it seems to be switched off.

50
00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:54.667
They probably forgot, and are sleeping at home.

51
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.067
I called Heiji's mom,

52
00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.967
and she said they took the 8:00 am plane right on time.

53
00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:01.767
8:00 am?

54
00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:05.767
They sure took such an early flight to arrive here in the afternoon.

55
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:09.267
I just remembered. They did say that they want to visit someone.

56
00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:14.167
The guy worked for the Police Detective Toyama who is Kazuha's father.

57
00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.867
Now, he's working for a private detective agency here in Tokyo.

58
00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:20.167
His name is Mr. Kusukawa, and it seems that they're going to meet him.

59
00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:23.967
Could he be Mr. Kusukawa at the Haido Detective Agency?

60
00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:26.167
Huh? Do you know him?

61
00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:27.367
Yes.

62
00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.167
Horse racing, motorboat racing, bicycle racing...

63
00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.067
He loves to gamble.

64
00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:36.567
Say, why did Heiji and Kazuha go meet him?

65
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.167
He sent Kazuha's father a letter

66
00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.667
saying he has an important matter to talk to him about,

67
00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.067
but he hasn't called since.

68
00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:44.967
So, Kazuha's father got worried

69
00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:46.967
and asked them to go see how he's doing.

70
00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:50.067
Maybe they got busy talking about their father,

71
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:52.067
and forgot about the time.

72
00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:53.667
I wonder.

73
00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:56.367
Well, I'll try call him up.

74
00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:59.767
"Haido Detective Agency"

75
00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:02.767
Yes, this is Haido Detective Agency.

76
00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:05.567
Mr. Mouri, how are you?

77
00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:07.967
Huh? Kusukawa?

78
00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:12.067
We haven't been able to get in touch with him for a couple of days now.

79
00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.467
He said he was after a big case,

80
00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:18.867
so I suppose he is staking up somewhere.

81
00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:20.467
A big case?

82
00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:23.767
Do you in a need of one more player to play mahjong?

83
00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:27.067
No. We would like to know

84
00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:30.967
if two high school kids called on Mr. Kusukawa.

85
00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:34.267
Yes. They were here at about 10 am.

86
00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.167
A boy and a girl from Osaka, aren't they?

87
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:38.967
I told them Kusukawa is not in the office,

88
00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:42.067
so after I gave them his address, they left.

89
00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:45.867
May I have that address, please?

90
00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.367
Haido street, 4...

91
00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:49.867
Arihato Apartment.

92
00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.167
Give me a break.

93
00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:57.467
The hosts shouldn't have to search for the guests.

94
00:05:57.467 --> 00:06:01.167
What's the problem? You're not busy anyway.

95
00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.267
It's not okay.

96
00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:06.067
I hope it stops raining soon.

97
00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:08.567
You're going on an excursion tomorrow, aren't you?

98
00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:09.867
Yes.

99
00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.767
Isn't that the Arihito Apartment?

100
00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:18.267
Let me see. Mr. Kusukawa's room number

101
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:20.067
is number 202.

102
00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:22.467
Room 202.

103
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:26.367
Room 202...

104
00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:27.567
Huh?

105
00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:30.467
"I'll be back by noon.

106
00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:33.367
Deliver any packages to the landlord, please."

107
00:06:33.367 --> 00:06:34.667
Hey, hey.

108
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:37.367
It's way past noon already.

109
00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:40.967
He is always behind time.

110
00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:45.467
Maybe he was here when both of them came by,

111
00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:48.367
and they went out together for a soda or something.

112
00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:50.767
With the intention to come back by noon.

113
00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:53.867
I saw a family restaurant on this way.

114
00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:58.267
But it looks like Heiji kept waiting for a long time.

115
00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:01.767
Look there, to the right of the paper.

116
00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:04.367
You can see a set mark.

117
00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:09.667
Doesn't it look like a mark of the cap Heiji usually wears?

118
00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:10.967
You're right.

119
00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:13.467
This is the mark of Heiji's cap!

120
00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:16.567
He must have put his cap on backwards

121
00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:19.267
and leaned against the door while waiting for quite some time.

122
00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:22.467
How do you know he kept waiting for a long time?

123
00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:27.267
There's another mark of his cap left in a place just my height.

124
00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:28.567
This means he got tired of waiting

125
00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:30.267
and squatted down while leaning against the door, doesn't it?

126
00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:31.967
It seems so.

127
00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:35.967
A Scotch tape?

128
00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:38.467
I know what this is!

129
00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:42.767
It's a mark to detect if someone tried to sneak into your house.

130
00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:43.867
Yes.

131
00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:47.267
You see them in detective or spy movies.

132
00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:49.667
But the tape is practically peeled off.

133
00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:52.367
It shows that someone's snuck in here already, doesn't it?

134
00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:55.367
It's possible that Mr. Kusukawa noticed it,

135
00:07:55.367 --> 00:07:59.667
got frightened, and rushed to the police.

136
00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:05.067
But it seems this tape was peeled off a long time ago.

137
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:08.367
A lot of dust is on the sticky part.

138
00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:09.767
Hey, hey.

139
00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:13.767
Then, when did he put this paper on the door?

140
00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:17.467
Mr. Kusukawa intends to come back soon,

141
00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:20.567
but for some reason he couldn't.

142
00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:25.267
And while he was away, somebody broke into this room.

143
00:08:25.267 --> 00:08:27.367
What shall we do, Dad?

144
00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:29.467
What do you mean that?

145
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.167
Wait a second, Conan!

146
00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:36.067
It's not locked.

147
00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:39.267
It's like as I said, somebody's snucked into this room already.

148
00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:40.467
Hey...

149
00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.867
The lock shows it was not forced open,

150
00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:48.367
and the room doesn't seem to be ransacked.

151
00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:51.267
Did he just forget to lock the door?

152
00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:53.867
And that tape, too.

153
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.667
I guess he forgot he put it there and opened the door himself.

154
00:09:00.367 --> 00:09:02.767
Huh? What's this?

155
00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:04.367
What?

156
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:05.967
Look here.

157
00:09:05.967 --> 00:09:08.167
He put something on the desk

158
00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:11.467
and rubbed it over with a pencil which left the traces.

159
00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:12.967
What did you say?

160
00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:17.867
Can it be this memo note?

161
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.967
There, the size just fits.

162
00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:22.667
I see.

163
00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:28.967
He rubbed over the traces the pencil made on the paper underneath.

164
00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:34.767
That Osaka boy must've been worried since Kusukawa was missing,

165
00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:37.367
and the door was unlocked.

166
00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:41.667
To figure out where Kusukawa was, that boy took the note with him.

167
00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:46.567
Well, the note that shows the letters are with him now.

168
00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:49.567
So, we don't know what's written on it.

169
00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:53.767
But I can see the letters if I rub it with a pencil.

170
00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:55.767
Of course!

171
00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:58.167
The pencil point pressed hard enough on the paper

172
00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:00.367
that it left traces on the paper two sheets below.

173
00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.567
Let's see. Itou of Kenbashi street?

174
00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:09.467
There's a phone number on it, too.

175
00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:11.867
But I can't make it out.

176
00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:16.367
Could Hattori and Kazuha have gone there?

177
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:18.767
Then, let's go there and have a look.

178
00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:21.667
We can ask for directions at a police box to help us find the house.

179
00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:26.167
A couple of high school kids that speak in Kansai accent?

180
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.467
They aren't here.

181
00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:31.267
By the way, are you a police detective or something?

182
00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:35.267
Oh, no. We are just looking for them.

183
00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.467
Thank you very much.

184
00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:41.667
Well, I didn't see any high school kids with a Kansai accent around here.

185
00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:45.167
Aren't you Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the sleeping detective?

186
00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:47.567
A high school boy from Osaka?

187
00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:52.167
Isn't the high school baseball tournament in Osaka is over?

188
00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:54.267
I don't know them or anybody else!

189
00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:56.567
Why do you keep picking on me?

190
00:10:58.467 --> 00:11:03.167
A boy and a girl with a Kansai accent?

191
00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:06.667
They haven't been here.

192
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.367
I thought so.

193
00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:11.667
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

194
00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.567
That pin on your lapel.

195
00:11:13.567 --> 00:11:15.667
It's an attorney's lapel pin.

196
00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:19.367
Excuse me, but are you Miss Misari Itou who is an attorney?

197
00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:21.867
Seriously?

198
00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:24.667
"Misari Itou" -Yes, I am.

199
00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.967
My mother told me about you.

200
00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:30.267
You're the admirable attorney

201
00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:32.467
who accepts all requests for a modest fee.

202
00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:36.167
Then, is your mother also an attorney?

203
00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:40.067
-Yes, ma'am. -You are a blabbermouth, Ran.

204
00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:46.867
Well, do you happen to know a suspicious Itou residence around here?

205
00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:48.667
Suspicious?

206
00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.967
Oh, that reminds me.

207
00:11:49.967 --> 00:11:52.367
There's a building that bears a nameplate Itou.

208
00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:57.167
It's right behind the elementary school on the 5th street.

209
00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:00.967
Children have been saying that there's two men who looked like hobos

210
00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:03.367
often come and go there at night.

211
00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:04.667
That's it!

212
00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:07.967
That's where they went, and so are we!

213
00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:09.967
What? Are we?

214
00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:11.867
Sure we are.

215
00:12:11.867 --> 00:12:13.867
Let's go.

216
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.967
Thank you very much, ma'am.

217
00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:17.167
You're welcome.

218
00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:25.267
Okay, okay.

219
00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:27.067
Let's go in, shall we?

220
00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:38.867
You must be hungry.

221
00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:40.767
But could you wait for a little while, dear?

222
00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:42.667
Your mom is busy right now.

223
00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:45.367
After I finish my work,

224
00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:47.667
I'll feed you. Okay, dear?

225
00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:50.567
Good kitty.

226
00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:52.967
Mommy has to go up to them

227
00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:55.967
and let them know where they stand.

228
00:12:55.967 --> 00:12:59.667
I've got to see to it that they feel it to the bones.

229
00:13:15.647 --> 00:13:18.447
Oh, my. What a sight to see.

230
00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:21.247
What happened to your handsome face? You're losing it.

231
00:13:21.247 --> 00:13:24.047
This brat tried to shout,

232
00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:27.147
and I caught him in time.

233
00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:28.747
Heiji, are you alright?

234
00:13:28.747 --> 00:13:30.147
Don't give in.

235
00:13:30.147 --> 00:13:32.447
You surprise me, boy.

236
00:13:32.447 --> 00:13:37.547
You're an acquaintance of the Kogoro Mouri.

237
00:13:37.547 --> 00:13:39.847
You really know a lot of people,

238
00:13:39.847 --> 00:13:43.247
high school kid detective, Heiji Hattori, don't you?

239
00:13:43.247 --> 00:13:48.647
You've been invited here because of that great ability of yours.

240
00:13:48.647 --> 00:13:50.447
So, do solve the cipher for us, will you?

241
00:13:50.447 --> 00:13:54.447
That cipher that this stinking rat of a detective thought up.

242
00:13:56.847 --> 00:13:59.947
What a laugh. But I'm sure you agree with me, too.

243
00:13:59.947 --> 00:14:03.947
This guy had the nerve to preach me.

244
00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:06.447
He asked me to stop instructing people how to evade taxes illegally.

245
00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:09.647
He had the tape to prove my doings,

246
00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:12.447
but didn't want to publicize it.

247
00:14:12.447 --> 00:14:16.247
The tape is in the safe deposit box in Tohto Bank

248
00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:21.947
with a seven digit number as an ID.

249
00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:26.347
Unfortunately, that's all he could tell us before he stopped breathing.

250
00:14:26.347 --> 00:14:30.147
And that's when we got a call from this boy.

251
00:14:30.147 --> 00:14:32.247
Excuse me.

252
00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.847
I couldn't hear you very well because I have a ringing in my ear.

253
00:14:34.847 --> 00:14:38.547
Give it a second thought, and tell me one more time.

254
00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:41.447
Who the stinking rat really is?

255
00:14:43.847 --> 00:14:45.047
Heiji!

256
00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:47.447
Don't get funny, boy.

257
00:14:47.447 --> 00:14:50.747
So, you haven't learned your lesson well enough.

258
00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:53.947
Scrape his ears off, so he can hear better.

259
00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:57.047
Heiji!

260
00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:00.847
Stop it, please!

261
00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:09.447
Darn it.

262
00:15:09.447 --> 00:15:12.247
Why are there so many visitors today?

263
00:15:15.947 --> 00:15:17.647
It's that little kid.

264
00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:22.147
Hello, little one. What's the matter?

265
00:15:22.147 --> 00:15:23.647
You forgot something?

266
00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:24.747
No, ma'am.

267
00:15:24.747 --> 00:15:28.747
I came back here because something bothers me.

268
00:15:28.747 --> 00:15:29.947
Kudo!

269
00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:32.747
What bothers you, dear little one?

270
00:15:32.747 --> 00:15:34.547
The footprints of shoes.

271
00:15:34.547 --> 00:15:39.247
There are so many wet shoe marks,

272
00:15:39.247 --> 00:15:41.747
so I was wondering where all those people are in the house.

273
00:15:42.747 --> 00:15:45.547
There were callers just a while ago.

274
00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:48.447
We talked in the hall and they left soon after.

275
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.647
So, right now I'm alone in this house.

276
00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:53.947
-Then, those prints are strange, aren't they? -Huh?

277
00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:58.747
There are all marks for going in, but none for going out.

278
00:15:58.747 --> 00:16:01.047
Why?

279
00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:04.847
That's right. They are my footprints.

280
00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:07.447
They stuck a gun at me in the hall.

281
00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:09.947
I was handcuffed, then brought straight into this attic

282
00:16:09.947 --> 00:16:11.347
and was confined.

283
00:16:13.047 --> 00:16:16.447
This is the footprint of my sneakers for jogging.

284
00:16:16.447 --> 00:16:17.647
They're yours?

285
00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:18.747
Yes.

286
00:16:18.747 --> 00:16:21.347
I washed the mud off, and I'm drying the shoes in the bathroom.

287
00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.247
That's why you don't see them here.

288
00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:25.547
Conan!

289
00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:27.647
What are you doing there?

290
00:16:27.647 --> 00:16:30.647
You disappeared so suddenly, so we were worried about you.

291
00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:33.447
They're looking for you, dear.

292
00:16:33.447 --> 00:16:37.047
You have to go find both of your friends, don't you?

293
00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:45.547
Do you want to get killed right now?

294
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.247
What's that sound?

295
00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:50.047
It came from upstairs.

296
00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:51.147
Well...

297
00:16:51.147 --> 00:16:54.647
You said you are alone in the house, didn't you?

298
00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:57.347
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

299
00:16:57.347 --> 00:16:59.247
It may be a burglar!

300
00:17:09.347 --> 00:17:11.347
It's the cat I saw a while ago.

301
00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:13.747
Oh, my. Naughty kitty.

302
00:17:13.747 --> 00:17:17.447
You shouldn't drop things down the stairs.

303
00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:19.847
She is very naughty.

304
00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:22.847
She drops things and makes them go rolling down so often.

305
00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:26.447
She must've made that sound.

306
00:17:26.447 --> 00:17:29.147
I have to go out now.

307
00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:30.647
But if you insist,

308
00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:33.747
I can go with you and help you find the burglar.

309
00:17:33.747 --> 00:17:35.647
Come, let's go upstairs.

310
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.647
Putting on a kind front and try to deceive him.

311
00:17:39.647 --> 00:17:42.647
But Kudo won't fall for it, you fool.

312
00:17:42.647 --> 00:17:47.147
Why don't you come on up, dear detective?

313
00:17:48.447 --> 00:17:50.047
I think I'll go home!

314
00:17:50.047 --> 00:17:51.747
Huh?

315
00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:53.147
Oh, really?

316
00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:55.047
You don't have to worry about me, feel free to come up.

317
00:17:55.047 --> 00:17:56.147
No, it's not that.

318
00:17:56.147 --> 00:17:57.847
So long, ma'am.

319
00:17:57.847 --> 00:18:00.147
Don't so long me. Hey, hey!

320
00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:02.347
So long, little one.

321
00:18:06.547 --> 00:18:09.447
He's gone I suppose.

322
00:18:09.447 --> 00:18:11.647
He sure scared me.

323
00:18:11.647 --> 00:18:13.147
Sorry, guys.

324
00:18:13.147 --> 00:18:15.847
You expected them to come back, but only a little kid did, right?

325
00:18:18.547 --> 00:18:20.747
Oh, no. What do you think you're doing?

326
00:18:20.747 --> 00:18:22.447
He's really going home!

327
00:18:22.447 --> 00:18:24.647
He must have his reasons.

328
00:18:24.647 --> 00:18:26.447
Look, he's thinking something over.

329
00:18:26.447 --> 00:18:28.547
Take a good look at him, fool.

330
00:18:28.547 --> 00:18:30.047
He's being held tightly in her arms.

331
00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:32.147
Although he's a bit ashamed, but he's glad at the same time.

332
00:18:32.147 --> 00:18:34.547
You can tell from his look. What a disgusting face.

333
00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:39.647
In her arms? I'm talking about Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

334
00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:44.847
The old man is probably listening to the horse races live on the radio.

335
00:18:44.847 --> 00:18:46.847
Now, leading by three to four lengths!

336
00:18:46.847 --> 00:18:49.947
Good, keep on leading to the finish!

337
00:18:49.947 --> 00:18:51.247
Looks like we have no choice,

338
00:18:51.247 --> 00:18:54.447
but to break this glass and make them notice us.

339
00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:58.447
What are you trying to do, you brats?

340
00:18:59.147 --> 00:19:00.247
Gosh.

341
00:19:00.247 --> 00:19:02.247
This is becoming tiresome.

342
00:19:04.947 --> 00:19:07.847
Now, it's time for your homework.

343
00:19:07.847 --> 00:19:10.547
You'd better make the most of your brain.

344
00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:13.647
You're the famous high school detective in Osaka.

345
00:19:13.647 --> 00:19:17.447
It should be easier for you than your math, right?

346
00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:19.347
This is a simple cipher to you.

347
00:19:20.347 --> 00:19:21.647
Get to your work.

348
00:19:21.647 --> 00:19:23.547
And be sure to solve it by sundown,

349
00:19:23.547 --> 00:19:26.947
if you don't want end up like him.

350
00:19:26.947 --> 00:19:30.147
You want to stay on this side of the world, don't you?

351
00:19:31.347 --> 00:19:33.147
What's the hurry?

352
00:19:33.147 --> 00:19:35.947
Why don't we take time, relax and solve it?

353
00:19:35.947 --> 00:19:39.647
Or is there anything to worry about tomorrow?

354
00:19:39.647 --> 00:19:42.247
Yes, there sure is.

355
00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:46.247
He told us that the same cipher will be delivered

356
00:19:46.247 --> 00:19:50.647
to his detective agency tomorrow by the delivery service.

357
00:19:51.647 --> 00:19:53.647
He attached a letter that has a copy of the cipher

358
00:19:53.647 --> 00:19:58.647
which is for the seven digit ID number to the Tohto Bank safe deposit box.

359
00:19:59.847 --> 00:20:01.647
He was such an idiot.

360
00:20:01.647 --> 00:20:05.347
He assumed he was safe because of that arrangement,

361
00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:07.847
and he was arrogant enough to tell me

362
00:20:07.847 --> 00:20:09.547
that he wouldn't say anything about it

363
00:20:09.547 --> 00:20:13.547
if I stop giving instructions on illegal tax evasion.

364
00:20:14.247 --> 00:20:17.047
I'm sure he was going to blackmail me

365
00:20:17.047 --> 00:20:21.847
and use the money for gambling that he loved so much.

366
00:20:21.847 --> 00:20:24.247
-Gambling? -Oh, yes.

367
00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:26.047
I remember Dad told me.

368
00:20:26.047 --> 00:20:29.047
Mr. Kusukawa is known for loving to gambling.

369
00:20:29.047 --> 00:20:31.947
Why didn't you tell me that before?

370
00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:35.347
What? Did you find anything already?

371
00:20:35.347 --> 00:20:38.947
Yes. Give me a little more time and leave me alone,

372
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:40.647
I think I can solve it.

373
00:20:42.447 --> 00:20:44.147
Good for you.

374
00:20:44.147 --> 00:20:48.747
Then, we'll have tea downstairs and will wait for you.

375
00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.447
So, you better make full use of your brain to solve it.

376
00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:54.847
And don't even think of running away from us.

377
00:20:54.847 --> 00:20:58.547
Sure. Wait for us without expecting anything from us.

378
00:21:06.647 --> 00:21:09.347
It's alright now, Mr. Kusukawa.

379
00:21:09.347 --> 00:21:10.447
What?

380
00:21:10.447 --> 00:21:12.747
You're still alive, aren't you?

381
00:21:12.747 --> 00:21:15.847
The floor dust underneath your nose just flew off.

382
00:21:19.647 --> 00:21:23.647
Just as expected of the son of the Director of Police Headquarters.

383
00:21:23.647 --> 00:21:27.547
I really was out of cold until just now.

384
00:21:28.847 --> 00:21:31.947
You'd better keep pretending you're dead.

385
00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:33.547
If they find you alive,

386
00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:37.847
they'll stick a gun at us and try to make you talk.

387
00:21:37.847 --> 00:21:41.147
The answer to this cipher is just like you.

388
00:21:41.147 --> 00:21:42.647
Just like him?

389
00:21:42.647 --> 00:21:45.247
You mean you found the answer to the cipher, Heiji?

390
00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:50.247
Yes, I did. The combination is easy to remember for a gambling fan.

391
00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:52.247
By the way, Mr. Kusukawa,

392
00:21:52.247 --> 00:21:55.047
is this the only copy of the cipher?

393
00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.447
It is.

394
00:21:56.447 --> 00:21:59.547
They didn't make any copy of it.

395
00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:01.647
Good for us.

396
00:22:01.647 --> 00:22:05.347
Just great for the gamble we're about to take.

397
00:23:43.447 --> 00:23:44.747
"Next Episode"

398
00:23:44.747 --> 00:23:46.747
What's this?

399
00:23:46.747 --> 00:23:48.847
Numerals and four alphabets.

400
00:23:48.847 --> 00:23:51.047
Q, A, K, J.

401
00:23:51.047 --> 00:23:52.447
Could it be...

402
00:23:52.447 --> 00:23:55.247
Huh? Conan, did you find out something?

403
00:23:55.247 --> 00:23:56.647
Yes. A little.

404
00:23:58.347 --> 00:24:00.347
Dice steaks?

405
00:24:01.547 --> 00:24:03.647
A red circle.

406
00:24:03.647 --> 00:24:07.347
I've got it. That's why the center was a nine.

407
00:24:07.347 --> 00:24:13.447
Next Conan, "Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 2)"

408
00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:16.715
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:16.715 --> 00:24:18.415
"Dice"

410
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:20.115
Heiji, you finished Part 1 with ease.

411
00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:21.215
Can you do it alone?

412
00:24:21.215 --> 00:24:22.515
He's not with us now, so I say, sure I can.

413
00:24:22.515 --> 00:24:23.461
And I say, don't expect me to help you.
