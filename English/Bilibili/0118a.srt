1
00:00:01.308 --> 00:00:04.648
Encounters are mysterious!
But Osaka is even more so!

2
00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:06.218
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:08.518
Today is a sixty-minute Naniwa special

4
00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:10.358
filled with incidents and mystery!

5
00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:11.938
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:13.808
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:16.148
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.645
This is the incident in Toyonaka.

9
00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:55.105
And this is last
week's incident in Harakata.

10
00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.725
There were no witnesses to these killings,

11
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:00.005
and they're dozens of kilometers away.

12
00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:04.705
We're checking into how
these two victims are connected,

13
00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:07.825
but they still share nothing in common.

14
00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:08.685
Chief Detective Toyama, Osaka Police Headquarters

15
00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.335
There's only one thing: the knife.
Chief Detective Toyama, Osaka Police Headquarters

16
00:02:11.335 --> 00:02:13.625
There's only one thing: the knife.

17
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:17.565
I don't know why, but they
were both stabbed in the heart,

18
00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:20.755
through their wallets in their jackets.

19
00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:24.225
Have you told the media about this?

20
00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:27.475
No, not the wallet part.

21
00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:35.725
That means the second killing
wasn't some moron's copycat attack.

22
00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:39.445
Correct, it was definitely
the same person.

23
00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:42.275
Serial murders...

24
00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:47.395
If the murders are
at random, it'll cause a panic.

25
00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:49.815
Toyama... You'd best be extra careful.

26
00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:54.185
Hattori Heizo Osaka Chief of Police
Toyama... You'd best be extra careful.

27
00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:56.205
Yes, I know.

28
00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:01.895
"The Naniwa Serial Murder Case."

29
00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:07.015
That's the Tennoji Zoo!

30
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.725
That's the Osaka Dome!

31
00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:13.435
And this is the Tsutenkaku Tower!

32
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:16.185
Whadya think? Osaka's nice, huh?!

33
00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:18.645
Yeah! This is a great view!

34
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:23.115
I dunno, it's no
different from the Tokyo Tower...

35
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:27.035
Don't be dumb! Don't compare
this with that tasteless red thing!

36
00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:30.065
The Tsutenkaku and
the new world all around it

37
00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:33.995
are brimming with the Osakans' humanity!

38
00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:37.455
It's almost like downtown Tokyo!

39
00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.855
How about some food now?

40
00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.925
Just a little longer!
I'm waiting for someone!

41
00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:46.185
Fine, guess I'll have a smoke.

42
00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.205
Hey, Hattori.

43
00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:52.345
Tell me why you called me to Osaka.

44
00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:55.015
Huh? You're concerned about that?

45
00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:58.015
You have another real reason, right?

46
00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:01.565
No, no! There's really no work this time!

47
00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:05.525
I just thought I'd
show you guys around Osaka!

48
00:04:06.105 --> 00:04:09.955
There's no telling when you'll die, after all.

49
00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:12.075
W-What's that mean?

50
00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:17.295
I had a bad dream...

51
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:18.645
Dream?

52
00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:23.015
Yeah... it happens when we catch a bad guy.

53
00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:28.465
But he winds up stabbing
and killing you instead!

54
00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:31.425
Hey, now!
Don't kill people on your own!

55
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:36.355
There you have it. So just enjoy Osaka!

56
00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:39.145
Sorry! Heiji-kun!

57
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:41.525
Oh! He's finally here!

58
00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:42.765
Sakata Yusuke (26) Tojiri Police Detective, Section 1

59
00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:45.725
I'm Sakata of the Osaka Police, Tojiri Station!
Sakata Yusuke (26) Tojiri Police Detective, Section 1

60
00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:45.805
Sorry for being so late!
Sakata Yusuke (26) Tojiri Police Detective, Section 1

61
00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:47.445
Sorry for being so late!

62
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.605
Why is a police detective here?

63
00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:53.605
My old man said that if
Mori-han's coming to Osaka,

64
00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:57.415
he should have a proper tour guide!

65
00:04:57.765 --> 00:05:01.665
Huh? Where is my old man?
He said he was going to stop by.

66
00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:05.085
The chief is busy in a
meeting about the incidents.

67
00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:07.255
"The incidents"?

68
00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:10.685
So, did you get the car?

69
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.015
Of course!

70
00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:17.225
I did just like you asked and
borrowed the Tojiri station's best one!

71
00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.685
H-Hey, now. Don't tell me this car is...

72
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:22.985
Well, let's go!

73
00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:29.065
Isn't this the best?! Cop cars are great!

74
00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:32.145
You can pass other
cars even in traffic jams!

75
00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:34.075
So, where would you like to go, guests?

76
00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:36.625
Tell me...

77
00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:40.185
Are you making us tour Osaka in this thing?!

78
00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:45.255
Huh? You don't like it? It's brand new!

79
00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:52.015
Oh, I know! Should I turn on the siren?
We can go even faster!

80
00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:54.225
No, that's not what he means...

81
00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:59.185
It feels like we're being arrested,
so it's kind of embarrassing.

82
00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:04.185
Oh, don't worry about that!
You haven't done anything wrong!

83
00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:06.355
Hold your heads high!

84
00:06:07.015 --> 00:06:09.315
Whadya think?! This is real udon!

85
00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:12.725
The soup's so clear
you can see the bottom!

86
00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:13.745
Yeah, you can!

87
00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:28.715
It's a light flavor, but good!

88
00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:32.175
Tastes like nothing.

89
00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:36.845
Oh, Heiji! Who's she?
A new girlfriend?

90
00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:38.725
Does it seem that way?

91
00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:42.105
No! I'm just a regular Tokyo--

92
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:47.185
What is it?

93
00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:49.025
I suddenly got a chill...

94
00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:52.195
So, where to next?

95
00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:56.705
Hmm, the next thing
Osaka is famous for is...

96
00:06:57.355 --> 00:06:59.115
Yum!

97
00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:02.185
This takoyaki is great!

98
00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:05.125
I've never had ones with such big octopus!

99
00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:06.795
What is it?

100
00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:12.135
Nothing... it just feels like
someone's been watching me...

101
00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:15.595
Oh, don't worry about it and eat up!

102
00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:19.565
I can't take my eyes off you!

103
00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:22.395
I thought you were
on a diet, Ran-neechan?

104
00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:27.985
Okonomiyaki? Why didn't
you say so before the takoyaki?

105
00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:31.015
We already passed a great place I know!

106
00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:33.945
We're going the wrong way!
We can't get there on Midosuji!

107
00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:36.645
Osaka is full of one-way roads,

108
00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:39.975
so you often have to go way out of your way!

109
00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.875
In that case, shall I show
them a nearby place I know?

110
00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:47.335
It's a good thing this place was nearby!

111
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:51.515
I'm gonna call my mom real quick.

112
00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:54.545
Mister! Don't forget the rice!

113
00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:58.015
You eat okonomiyaki with rice?

114
00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:01.975
Of course! It's a main dish!

115
00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:05.675
Rice with the sauce on it is great, too!

116
00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:09.965
Osaka's neat!

117
00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:10.815
Yeah!

118
00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:15.115
Oh! That seat is taken--

119
00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:19.325
You're Kudo, aren't you?

120
00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:25.375
Heiji's always talking about you.

121
00:08:26.515 --> 00:08:27.835
Whoa, now!

122
00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:30.045
Hattori-kun does?!

123
00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:35.005
Don't play dumb.
I already know everything.

124
00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:36.845
H-Hold on!

125
00:08:36.845 --> 00:08:44.805
I know you're the Kudo broad
from Tokyo who's seducing him!

126
00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:48.685
Umm, I think you have the wrong idea...

127
00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:52.855
I have just one thing to say to you:

128
00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:57.985
Heiji and I were once
bound by "chains of iron"!

129
00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:02.355
If you want to mess with Heiji,
you gotta go through me--!

130
00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:04.145
Hey, Kazuha.

131
00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:07.665
What're you doing here?

132
00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:11.625
You're hilarious!

133
00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:12.015
The "Kudo" I talked about is a guy! A guy!

134
00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:15.585
Toyama Kazuha (17) Heiji's childhood friend
The "Kudo" I talked about is a guy! A guy!

135
00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:19.055
And this girl is Kudo's squeeze.

136
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.135
Squeeze?

137
00:09:22.135 --> 00:09:24.185
I-It isn't like that!

138
00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:26.165
She says she isn't.

139
00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.895
She's just embarrassed.

140
00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:32.355
Then why didn't you
ask Kudo to come too?

141
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:36.185
Don't be stupid!
Kudo's sitting right--!

142
00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:38.275
H-He couldn't make it!

143
00:09:40.855 --> 00:09:44.745
Anyway, tell us more
about this "chains of iron" thing!

144
00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:53.665
When we were kids, we found
my old man's handcuffs in the attic.

145
00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:57.915
Then we got stuck together when
I pretended to be a policeman!

146
00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:02.395
It was lame;
we found ourselves in big trouble!

147
00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:07.685
It was not lame! We had to bathe
and use the bathroom together!

148
00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:09.895
You moron! Don't tell them that!

149
00:10:10.395 --> 00:10:12.355
Bathe and use the bathroom?

150
00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:15.815
Sounds like a smelly relationship.

151
00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:21.895
To commemorate it, I put a piece
of the chain in here for good luck!

152
00:10:21.895 --> 00:10:25.285
Gross! Throw that thing away!

153
00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:28.705
Say! Are you two going out?!

154
00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:34.645
No, no! Heiji and I are just
childhood friends!

155
00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:37.965
I'm like his big sister
who's always looking after him!

156
00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:39.925
Sure you are.

157
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:46.185
Her dad's chief detective of the
Osaka police and my dad's friend,

158
00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:49.025
so we've known each other
since we were kids, that's all.

159
00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:53.765
A detective runt and the
daughter of a police detective...

160
00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:55.605
What an ominous couple...

161
00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:57.855
Eh? How come? What's wrong with that?

162
00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:02.435
Still, why are you here?

163
00:11:02.435 --> 00:11:06.395
I was acting as your
big sister and keeping watch

164
00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:10.205
so the creepy Tokyo girl
won't try and seduce you!

165
00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:13.665
Keeping watch? From where?

166
00:11:14.185 --> 00:11:16.085
The Tsutenkaku Tower.

167
00:11:17.225 --> 00:11:22.105
Now I see! She was
the one I sensed watching me!

168
00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:24.255
...attitude?! I was worried about you!

169
00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.145
Thanks for the meal!

170
00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:27.725
I'm stuffed!

171
00:11:28.225 --> 00:11:29.685
That was delicious!

172
00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:35.105
Sorry to keep you waiting!
You should've joined us!

173
00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:37.645
No, no, I'm just
here to show you around!

174
00:11:40.935 --> 00:11:42.565
Where to next?

175
00:11:42.565 --> 00:11:45.575
I guess only Osaka Castle is left...

176
00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:48.405
What are you doing in here?

177
00:11:48.685 --> 00:11:51.365
Oh, come on! Take me with you!

178
00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:54.225
What a pain...

179
00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:59.005
Huh?

180
00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:18.461
What happened to this man?!

181
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:21.801
I don't know! He suddenly
fell onto the hood of the car!

182
00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:24.351
From the roof of this building!

183
00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:26.511
Someone's up there!

184
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:29.961
Sakata-han! Contact the police!

185
00:12:29.961 --> 00:12:30.731
G-Got it!

186
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:32.061
H-Hey!

187
00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:33.041
Heiji!

188
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:33.901
Conan-kun!

189
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:46.301
Alright!

190
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:51.171
Now you tell us why you dropped
that body on top of a police car!

191
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:55.961
N-No! I'm just a--!

192
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:59.921
What?! He was called to the roof?!

193
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:07.211
Yeah... someone called this guy
about a strange man on the roof.

194
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.951
I run a tea shop on
the second floor, you see...

195
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:15.321
But what sent the body falling?

196
00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:19.671
The body was wrapped in rope,
attached to the roof's handrail,

197
00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:23.631
and covered with a tarp,
while the other end of the rope

198
00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:27.291
was tied to the door so the rope
would come undone when opened.

199
00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:32.381
I put his estimated time of
death at about one full day ago.

200
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:37.211
So someone murdered him this
time yesterday and left him hanging.

201
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:40.341
But why on top of a police car?

202
00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:43.511
It was probably just coincidence,

203
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:47.221
but it could be someone
trying to make an example...

204
00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:48.811
Example?

205
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:53.551
The knife through the wallet and heart...

206
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:55.611
This is clearly connected
with those incidents...

207
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.571
Hey! Lady! Hold up!

208
00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:03.621
Hey! Wait!

209
00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:09.541
There she goes!

210
00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:12.501
It's all right.
I got her license plate number.

211
00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:17.841
But never mind that.
Tell me about "those incidents," Hattori!

212
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:23.841
Serial murders?!
Tojiri Police Station, Osaka

213
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.761
And that man who fell was the third one?!

214
00:14:28.131 --> 00:14:29.261
Yep.

215
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:33.551
In each case, they were stabbed
in the chest, through their wallets.

216
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:36.731
After they were strangled
to death with something.

217
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:40.321
Maybe it was someone
who held a grudge about money?

218
00:14:40.321 --> 00:14:42.781
No, we can't say that for sure.

219
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:45.631
Nagao Hidetoshi Convenience store owner
The first victim, Nagao Hidetoshi,

220
00:14:45.631 --> 00:14:46.741
was a convenience store owner.
Nagao Hidetoshi Convenience store owner

221
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:49.261
Nishiguchi Tayo Pub mistress
The next victim, Nishiguchi Tayo,

222
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:51.701
was the mistress of a small pub.
Nishiguchi Tayo Pub mistress

223
00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:54.341
Noyasu Kazuto Taxi driver
And the one who fell was Noyasu Kazuto,

224
00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:56.671
a taxi driver.
Noyasu Kazuto Taxi driver

225
00:14:56.911 --> 00:15:00.841
None of them had enough
money to incur someone's wrath.

226
00:15:00.841 --> 00:15:05.091
In fact, none of them
are connected in any way.

227
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:07.301
There's no connection?

228
00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:08.131
Nope.

229
00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:12.591
They were all born, raised,
schooled, and employed in Osaka,

230
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:14.311
but all in different places.

231
00:15:16.921 --> 00:15:20.611
We found it, Heiji-kun!
We found a link between the victims!

232
00:15:21.131 --> 00:15:22.361
Seriously?!

233
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:30.281
Goshi-san!
Goshi-san! Any comments?!

234
00:15:30.671 --> 00:15:37.751
Huh? Isn't this from Goshi Sotaro's
corruption case six years ago?

235
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:42.461
The case where his secretary
took responsibility for him and quit?

236
00:15:43.051 --> 00:15:46.051
As I recall,
the secretary's name was Nagao...

237
00:15:46.051 --> 00:15:48.381
Hey! Is our Nagao--?!

238
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:49.891
Yes.

239
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:54.311
Nagao Hidetoshi,
the first one who was killed!

240
00:15:54.961 --> 00:15:59.301
But didn't you already
investigate this? Why now?

241
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:02.521
No, take a look at the driver.

242
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:04.461
The driver?

243
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:09.911
Th-That's Noyasu, the third victim!

244
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:14.371
It seems he was Assemblyman
Goshi's driver until four years ago.

245
00:16:15.131 --> 00:16:17.921
His former secretary and
his former driver...

246
00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:21.541
Assemblyman Goshi
may be involved in this.

247
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:27.171
We thought so too, so one of
my seniors is headed to his place now.

248
00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:31.891
Still, he's famous for his hatred of police.

249
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:34.851
Just going to see him won't help anything.

250
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.811
Then what do you say
we pay a visit too, Sakata-chan?

251
00:16:39.091 --> 00:16:42.271
Hold on! You should
leave that to the police!

252
00:16:42.881 --> 00:16:44.211
Don't be stupid.

253
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:49.241
I can't just let the guy who screwed
up your Osaka tour get away!

254
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:53.201
Head over to my house!
Kazuha can tell you where it is!

255
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.121
Heiji! Do you have the good luck charm?!

256
00:16:57.131 --> 00:16:59.791
Yep, sure do. Don't worry.

257
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:01.621
Well, later!

258
00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:06.921
What good luck charm?

259
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:12.471
A good luck charm I gave him.
It's always protected his life.

260
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:14.961
What nonsense.

261
00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:16.171
It's true!

262
00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:21.191
The last time he forgot it,
he got really hurt in a kendo match!

263
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:25.801
They're very important charms!
There are only two in the world!

264
00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:26.651
Two?

265
00:17:26.651 --> 00:17:32.301
Yeah, remember that story
about us and the handcuffs?

266
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.371
I secretly put a piece of the
chain in his good luck charm!

267
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:37.331
Oh?

268
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:43.261
Though it's none of your business!

269
00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:45.291
Y-Yeah.

270
00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:48.961
Never mind that.
I don't see the runt anywhere...

271
00:17:48.961 --> 00:17:50.061
Eh?!

272
00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:51.731
Did he go to the bathroom?

273
00:17:52.431 --> 00:17:55.311
I guess this means
no more police cars...

274
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:00.341
Sorry, Sakata-chan.

275
00:18:00.341 --> 00:18:03.671
You gotta write a letter apologizing
for the crushed car, don't you?

276
00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:05.351
It's fine. I'm used to it.

277
00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.961
But what's with the gut?

278
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:09.071
Oh, this?

279
00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:14.991
This kid'll be helpful!

280
00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:19.161
But won't Mori-han be worried?!

281
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:21.581
It's okay! I'll call him later!

282
00:18:22.211 --> 00:18:25.881
Oh, that reminds me,
we used the license plate number to get

283
00:18:25.881 --> 00:18:29.551
the address and phone number
of that suspicious woman you saw.

284
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:33.261
Her name is Okazaki Sumie, age 39.

285
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:38.761
She divorced last year and lives
alone in the West Side Apartments.

286
00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:40.931
Want to check her out first?

287
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:44.891
Yeah... it seemed
like she knew something.

288
00:18:45.711 --> 00:18:48.861
Here, I'll call to
see if she's home or not.

289
00:18:49.221 --> 00:18:49.671
West Side Apartments

290
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:53.551
At 1:00 pm today, a body fell near the Shinsai Bridge.
West Side Apartments

291
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:55.051
At 1:00 pm today, a body fell near the Shinsai Bridge.

292
00:18:55.051 --> 00:19:01.171
The deceased was identified
as Noyasu Kazuto-san, age 41.

293
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:02.011
Moreover...

294
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:06.251
Forgive me... Forgive me...

295
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:12.381
Yes?

296
00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:14.921
Oh, is this Okazaki-san's residence?

297
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:19.011
My name is Sakata,
I'm with the Tojiri Police Department.

298
00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:24.981
O-Officer! Hurry here and
protect me! I'm going to be killed!

299
00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:29.131
I'll tell you everything!
Just hurry here! Hurry!

300
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.761
Just calm down! I'll be right there!

301
00:19:31.761 --> 00:19:34.861
Lock your door and don't let anyone in!

302
00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:39.411
Oh no! We passed the West Side Apartments!

303
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.051
What now?! It's a one-way
road and it's a heavy traffic day!

304
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:44.501
It'll take forever to turn around!

305
00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:47.211
It'll be faster on foot! Stop the car!

306
00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:48.171
H-Heiji-kun!

307
00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:51.641
Watch it!

308
00:19:51.641 --> 00:19:52.381
Sorry!

309
00:19:53.381 --> 00:19:54.461
Watch it!

310
00:19:58.841 --> 00:20:03.091
West Side Apartments

311
00:20:06.921 --> 00:20:11.991
Hey! Lady! We're with that
cop who called earlier! Open up!

312
00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:19.031
It's unlocked!

313
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.731
Hey! Lady!

314
00:20:26.921 --> 00:20:27.821
Hey!

315
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:33.961
Lady! Where are you?!

316
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:44.051
This is Sakata.

317
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:46.841
Eh?! Okazaki-san isn't home?!

318
00:20:46.841 --> 00:20:49.021
Nope. The place is empty.

319
00:20:49.341 --> 00:20:51.981
That's crazy! I told her not to leave!

320
00:20:52.261 --> 00:20:55.321
Did she contact you at all?

321
00:20:55.711 --> 00:20:59.491
Of course not. I didn't give her my number.

322
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.451
Oh, right.

323
00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:04.911
Anyway, hurry here. Something's not right.

324
00:21:05.211 --> 00:21:09.871
I just got off the one-way road,
so I'll be there in a few minutes.

325
00:21:12.801 --> 00:21:13.671
It's from downstairs!

326
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:17.551
The public restroom!

327
00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:19.011
D-Don't tell me she--!

328
00:21:36.841 --> 00:21:38.981
Too late. She's dead.

329
00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:42.951
But why?! Why did she go outside?!

330
00:21:43.351 --> 00:21:46.781
And there's a knife
through her wallet and chest...

331
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:51.371
Who's doing this?! And why?!
