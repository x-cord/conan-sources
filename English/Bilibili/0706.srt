1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:04,224
As compensation for what happened on the Bell Tree Express,

2
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:07,724
Sonoko invited us to go to Izu Highlands.

3
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,924
And for some reason, Tohru Amuro was also there

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:14,624
as a tennis coach.

5
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:17,824
Conan!

6
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:19,424
By some queer work of fate,

7
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:20,924
we ended up taking a rest at a villa

8
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:23,024
where a group of tennis club members were gathered.

9
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,424
However, when I came to, lying next to me on the floor

10
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,824
was a corpse in an unnatural position.

11
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:32,224
Aiming for a 100% solution.

12
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,624
He cleared all mysteries and codes.

13
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:36,724
I deduced the locked room murder with Bourbon?

14
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:38,824
What's he after sticking around me?

15
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:44,724
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:32,462
"Bourbon Solves the Mystery"

19
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:38,862
Yes. I went to Ishiguri's room

20
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:40,862
to ask him if he really didn't want

21
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,862
cold Chinese noodles for lunch.

22
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,462
"Kotone Momozono (21)" -But he said he didn't want it since he wanted

23
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:47,162
"University Student" -to eat the ice cake from yesterday.

24
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:48,462
I see.

25
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,762
Then, what did you do after that?

26
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,662
After eating lunch with everyone in the kitchen,

27
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:55,362
I took a shower.

28
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:59,162
Come to think of it, my girls also said they took a shower.

29
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:03,762
Yes. After that, I stayed with them

30
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:07,462
until I went to check on Ishiguri together with Machi.

31
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:11,962
By the way, when did the spare key to Mr. Ishiguri's room disappear?

32
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,762
I think it was last night.

33
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:18,262
I had the key in the drawer in my room.

34
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,562
Yes, that's right.

35
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,462
"Machi Umejima (22)" -I went to check on Ishiguri

36
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:23,862
"University Student" -together with Kotone.

37
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:27,162
You went there just that once?

38
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,962
I also went there before I took a shower.

39
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:32,762
I wanted to tell him that I was going to use the shower

40
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,962
because I experienced him peeping me some time ago.

41
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:37,762
Did you take a shower after Ms. Kotone?

42
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:38,862
Yes.

43
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:42,362
And? Was Mr. Ishiguri in the room back then?

44
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:44,862
He didn't answer back then,

45
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,762
but I think he was in his room.

46
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:49,162
It seems like the air conditioner was running.

47
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,462
Then, what were you doing before and after the shower?

48
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,162
Like I already said.

49
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:55,062
I was getting lunch ready

50
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:58,062
and mending the girls' racket.

51
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:01,662
At any rate, I was with somebody all the time.

52
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,862
Yes, I also went there

53
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,762
to apologize to Ishiguri.

54
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:08,862
"Noboru Takanashi (22)" -I kind of had it out with him before lunch.

55
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,762
"University Student" -I wanted to tell him that I am sorry.

56
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:15,062
Do you know if that was before or after Ms. Machi took a shower?

57
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:18,862
I don't know when Machi took a shower,

58
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:20,662
but it was after cleaning the dishes

59
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,162
and before taking out the garbage.

60
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,362
Come to think of it, that fight had something to do

61
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,562
with a member of the circle who passed away, right?

62
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:28,762
Right.

63
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:32,062
This winter, a man called Uryu passed away.

64
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,462
He was a member of our circle,

65
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,062
and he was found buried in the snow behind the lodge

66
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,862
after he went skiing.

67
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:40,862
Back then, the snow behind the lodge lay as high as 2 meters.

68
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,062
He took Ishiguri's joke saying that

69
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,262
jumping from the second floor into it wouldn't kill him literally.

70
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:48,462
He actually jumped into it.

71
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:51,562
Yesterday was Uryu's birthday,

72
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,562
so we all got together to celebrate it.

73
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:58,362
He had a terrible birthday last year.

74
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,662
A terrible birthday?

75
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:04,862
We got together last year at about the same time,

76
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:06,962
and since it was Uryu's birthday,

77
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:10,562
Ishiguri said that we should surprise him.

78
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:14,662
We snuck into the room Uryu was sleeping in through the veranda

79
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:18,162
and popped some party crackers near his ear.

80
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:22,562
Then he got panic and started crying.

81
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,162
On top of that, a video of his plight was taken

82
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:27,262
and it was uploaded on the web by Ishiguri.

83
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,662
I see.

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,462
As to you three,

85
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:34,562
it seems that you all have more than enough motive to kill Mr. Ishiguri.

86
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,062
Motive?

87
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:39,462
The only time I went to Ishiguri's room was just that once.

88
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,862
Other than that, I was with all of you the whole time, wasn't I?

89
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:45,662
I was with you while the detective was talking.

90
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:48,062
"The air conditioner in this room isn't working well,

91
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:50,762
so go to Ishiguri's room and rest."

92
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,262
Wasn't it me who told that to the kid?

93
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:55,462
-Is that true? -Yes.

94
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:58,162
After that, I saw Mr. Ishiguri in the corridor,

95
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,962
so I had him take me with him.

96
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,862
How could I possibly commit murder

97
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,862
knowing that a child is sleeping in the room?

98
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,362
True.

99
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:10,062
No matter what kind of trick was used,

100
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,362
I thought it was only possible for a man

101
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,862
to move the heavy corpse of Mr. Ishiguri,

102
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:17,062
which was none other than the only male suspect, Mr. Takanashi.

103
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:18,762
-Yes. -But...

104
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,462
if it was only to lift the top part of the body,

105
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,662
wouldn't a woman be able to do it too?

106
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,962
One could place the corpse up against the doorway

107
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:27,162
and let go of the body so it would slide down,

108
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,762
then finally close the door.

109
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:31,562
No. I think that would be impossible

110
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,562
because the buttocks of the corpse

111
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:35,262
was in a position that blocked the door.

112
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,062
Besides, the spare key to Mr. Ishiguri's room

113
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,162
hasn't been found yet either.

114
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:42,262
What's the key like?

115
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,562
It seems to have been the same kind

116
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:47,162
as the one found in the pocket of the corpse.

117
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:49,962
We haven't heard that it's been found yet.

118
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:52,562
Then, maybe it was disposed together with the trash?

119
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:56,462
I helped throw the trash away together with Ran.

120
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:57,662
What?

121
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:01,562
We put it into the trunk of Mr. Takanashi's car, though.

122
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:04,462
We were told that he would take it home and throw it away.

123
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:08,462
Then, maybe the key is in that trash.

124
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,862
Check it immediately!

125
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,662
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

126
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:15,762
Did anyone else ask you to do anything else?

127
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:18,562
Ms. Kotone asked us to put the sports drink

128
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,862
back into the freezer.

129
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,162
So we did that.

130
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:24,562
Put the sports drink into the freezer?

131
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:27,262
She said that she likes to drink it frozen.

132
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,962
At the time, there was a fuss

133
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:31,162
about Mr. Ishiguri not coming out of his room.

134
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:34,762
Ms. Kotone was holding a PET bottle.

135
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:37,962
I think she wanted to freeze it again because it was starting to melt.

136
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,462
She just made it look like that and put the key in there.

137
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:43,262
A key wouldn't fit inside.

138
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:49,062
After I took a shower, I took a sip of that drink,

139
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,962
but it was totally frozen.

140
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,862
Oh, that's right.

141
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,362
Ms. Machi told us that she would re-wrap

142
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,862
the grip tapes of our rackets.

143
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,862
We left our rackets with her.

144
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,562
And while she was at it, she also changed

145
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,562
the strings of our rackets, too.

146
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,562
Inspector Yokomizo.

147
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:10,962
We found no key in the trash.

148
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,062
I see.

149
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:15,062
The sports drink in the freezer is frozen solid

150
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:19,662
and it doesn't seem possible for a key to be inside it.

151
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:21,762
What about the rackets?

152
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:24,662
We checked the rackets of everyone,

153
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:27,062
but there wasn't anything that looks like a key attached anywhere.

154
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:28,762
Speaking of rackets, we got a report

155
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,462
that the strings of the racket under the corpse's buttocks

156
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,962
seem to be out of shape in several spots.

157
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,662
The strings? Why?

158
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:37,762
We don't know.

159
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:41,662
Also, the shape of the copper vase that had blood on it,

160
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:44,862
matched the wound on the head of the corpse.

161
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:48,262
But for some reason, it seems there was water in the vase.

162
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,662
Water?

163
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,962
Why would water be inside the murder weapon?

164
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,462
By the way, the estimated time of death

165
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:57,662
was two to three hours before the corpse was found.

166
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,462
Depending on the temperature of the room at that time,

167
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:04,062
there may be a discrepancy of about 30 minutes or so.

168
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:07,162
I had lunch with everyone here

169
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:10,262
around three hours before the corpse was found.

170
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:14,962
All three of them had the chance to commit the crime.

171
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:18,362
You. Didn't you see the culprit?

172
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:20,462
You were in the room the whole time, weren't you?

173
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,562
I was fast asleep.

174
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,362
So you also don't remember that Sonoko and I

175
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,462
took the cold Chinese noodles to that room, do you?

176
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:30,762
Nope. I think I was asleep.

177
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:32,962
Come to think of it, Ran.

178
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:36,662
Back then, you said something weird, didn't you?

179
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:39,362
It seems he's asleep, so why not let him be?

180
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,862
Missing lunch won't kill him either.

181
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:43,162
That's true.

182
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,862
It seems that the air conditioner of this room is working, too.

183
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:49,162
How would you know that

184
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,962
despite being outside of the room?

185
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,662
That's because my toes were cold.

186
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,862
I'm sure that cold air was leaking out

187
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,162
through the space under the door.

188
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:02,462
If I remember correctly, Ms. Machi said something similar.

189
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,362
I think he was in the room.

190
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:06,562
It seems like the air conditioner was running.

191
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:11,662
I see. That's how it is.

192
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:15,362
The culprit ingeniously used an object that doesn't keep its form

193
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:19,362
and completed the locked room murder.

194
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,770
Officer.

195
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,870
Maybe it was an accident after all?

196
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,570
Ishiguri's corpse was on the floor and was blocking the door.

197
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,470
If there was a racket under his buttocks,

198
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,670
maybe when he tried to pick up the racket,

199
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,570
the vase just happened to fall on him?

200
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,470
On top of that, the room was locked.

201
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,470
The spare key hasn't been found yet, has it?

202
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,970
No.

203
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,270
The area around the villa is being checked now.

204
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,670
However, we've still got no such report.

205
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,270
I don't care what it is,

206
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,070
but this is what I call messy handwriting.

207
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,170
As long as I can read it, it's fine.

208
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,570
Okay, he sat down.

209
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,470
Like usual, I'll fire the tranquilizer gun at Pops.

210
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,570
What are you doing, Conan?

211
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,970
The lid of my wristwatch broke.

212
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,270
Even if I wanted to, I guess I can't start

213
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,770
the Sleeping Kogoro stunt in front of him.

214
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,570
He's Bourbon, a member of the Black Organization.

215
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,570
I can't afford to have him find out that I'm Shinichi Kudo,

216
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,570
whose body has become a child's because of the organization's drug.

217
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,570
Even if Vermouth says nothing about it,

218
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,770
they may still find out that the same thing's happened to Ai, too.

219
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,170
Besides,

220
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,770
maybe the sound that we heard when we were downstairs

221
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,570
wasn't the sound of the vase falling, was it?

222
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,470
Back then, only the corpse

223
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,170
and the sleeping boy were in that room.

224
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,070
Besides, the vase wouldn't fall on its own.

225
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,070
I guess it was the sound of the house creaking after all.

226
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,470
If it was the creaking of the house,

227
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,170
I also heard it when we were eating cold Chinese noodles.

228
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,770
It was totally different.

229
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,370
Hey, hey.

230
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,870
Speaking of cold Chinese noodles,

231
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,570
you use ice when making it, right?

232
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,670
Yes. The noodles that are boiled

233
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,670
are cooled down in ice water.

234
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,970
Hey, cut out the unnecessary talk.

235
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,170
But ice melts, doesn't it?

236
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,070
That's common sense!

237
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,370
If so, if the vase was made of ice,

238
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,470
it would eventually melt and fall on its own.

239
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,770
You idiot.

240
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,770
That vase is made of bronze.

241
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,370
I mean, you touched it too, didn't you?

242
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,870
Please wait.

243
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,270
If a lot of ice is stacked

244
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,370
only on one side in the vase,

245
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,970
and it was placed near the rim of the shelf,

246
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,970
it's just a matter of time before the ice would melt,

247
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,270
and the vase would tilt out of balance and fall on its own, right?

248
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,970
But if a large amount of ice were to be carried around,

249
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,970
wouldn't anyone have noticed it?

250
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,170
No, you can do so without holding it in your hands.

251
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,170
When the Chinese noodles were being made,

252
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,370
all three of them were in their tennis wear.

253
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,370
The pants of men's tennis wear have large pockets

254
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,270
so that tennis balls would fit into them.

255
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,570
There are also skirts in women's tennis wear

256
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,570
with pockets big enough for the balls to fit in.

257
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,570
But...

258
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,870
even if it were possible to automatically drop the vase,

259
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,470
it wouldn't be possible to move the corpse

260
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,170
over to the door, would it?

261
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,170
There were no drag trails on the floor either.

262
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,370
Come to think of it,

263
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,370
ice is very slippery, isn't it?

264
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,070
Not you again, brat.

265
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,170
I see! I've figured it out!

266
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,670
Remember the racket under the buttocks of the corpse?

267
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,170
The corpse was moved by placing ice under the racket

268
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,770
that was under the buttocks of the corpse.

269
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,770
The strings of the racket being out of shape proves just that!

270
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,770
Wow, Sonoko!

271
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,470
But if that was the case,

272
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,870
like the vase, water from the melted ice

273
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,870
should be left on the floor.

274
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,870
And the slacks of the corpse should also be wet.

275
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,470
But there were no such traces.

276
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,770
Is that so?

277
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,370
It would've been nice if there was something

278
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,170
like ice that leaves nothing behind even after it melts.

279
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,970
Could that be dry ice, then?

280
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,770
Dry ice is made of carbon dioxide,

281
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,670
so it will vanish.

282
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,070
But dry ice can't be carried around easily.

283
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,470
Unlike ice, you can't touch it directly.

284
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,170
Mr. Ishiguri unknowingly carried it with him.

285
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,470
After deciding to have lunch, he was about to go to his room.

286
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,070
Someone must've secretly put dry ice inside the ice cake box.

287
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,770
The culprit probably took a racket with a string

288
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,870
after hitting Mr. Ishiguri on the head with the vase and killing him.

289
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,870
The racket that had a string pulled through it beforehand

290
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,170
was placed on top of several pieces of dry ice.

291
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,570
Then, the buttocks of the corpse were placed on the racket.

292
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,370
After the culprit left the room,

293
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,770
the string was pulled towards the door.

294
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,970
Of course, the string was left untied

295
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,670
so that it could be retrieved later.

296
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,070
I see.

297
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,870
That's why when I went to that room, my toes felt chilly.

298
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,070
It was because the dry ice was near the door.

299
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,770
Come to think of it, Ms. Machi said something similar, too.

300
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,070
Yes.

301
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,770
Didn't any of you notice anything?

302
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,270
-No. -Neither did I.

303
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,270
I figured that the boy was sleeping in the room,

304
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,970
so I left right away.

305
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,870
I see.

306
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,070
I've finally figured out the culprit.

307
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,770
First of all, we could remove Ms. Machi from the list of suspects

308
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,770
because she testified that there was dry ice.

309
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,470
And the same goes for Mr. Takanashi

310
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,570
who knew that the boy was in Mr. Ishiguri's room.

311
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,770
Since there probably isn't anyone who would commit a murder

312
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,770
right next to a sleeping child.

313
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,070
If so, rather than the two, the culprit is the one

314
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,470
who went to Mr. Ishiguri's room before them.

315
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,270
The one who could buy enough time for the ice and dry ice to melt.

316
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,570
Ms. Kotone Momozono.

317
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,470
The culprit is none other than you!

318
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,170
Am I wrong?

319
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,870
Hey... Hold it there, Mr. Mouri.

320
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,870
Is it alright for you not to do your usual stunt?

321
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,170
-What? -The sleeping pose!

322
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,570
For once, he's doing it right and then.

323
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,170
So, the procedure Ms. Kotone took to commit the crime is as follows.

324
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,070
First, while she was making the cold Chinese noodles,

325
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,970
she snuck the ice into her skirt pocket.

326
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,170
She said, "I'll go and ask if Ishiguri wants lunch".

327
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,870
With that, she left for his room.

328
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,870
Then, after hitting Mr. Ishiguri to death near the door,

329
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,770
she packed the murder weapon vase with ice

330
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,270
and put it on the shelf.

331
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,870
So, like the trick mentioned earlier, after she left the room,

332
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,370
she moved Mr. Ishiguri's corpse so that it would block the door.

333
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,770
At that time, she had no idea

334
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,170
that the boy with glasses was sleeping there.

335
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,870
After returning to the kitchen, Ms. Kotone said,

336
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,370
"He's not eating cold Chinese noodles after all".

337
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,470
Just like that, she lied, ate lunch as if nothing had happened,

338
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,570
and completed the locked room murder.

339
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:19,770
But it seems you couldn't deceive the eyes of this famed detective.

340
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,470
Somehow, he looks more quack when he's awake.

341
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,870
I guess so.

342
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,970
Then, where's the spare key?

343
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,270
The door of Ishiguri's room was locked, wasn't it?

344
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,370
Well, most probably...

345
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,670
I'm sure we'll find it somewhere in time.

346
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,270
That's right. Speaking of ice...

347
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,670
-Ice... -Ice?

348
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,370
When water freezes, it become icy, right?

349
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,770
That's why it's called ice, right?

350
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,070
How should I know?

351
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,770
Talking about frozen water,

352
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,570
the sports drink that Ms. Kotone was drinking...

353
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,870
Was the key in there, after all?

354
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,070
No way.

355
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,870
I drank that drink too,

356
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,870
but it was virtually frozen and the contents wouldn't come out.

357
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,170
Then, maybe the key was put inside before it was frozen.

358
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,370
If so, I think it should show

359
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,270
through the bottom of the PET bottle.

360
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,970
That's because keys are heavy.

361
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,170
However, if there is magic water that freezes

362
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,670
the minute the key is put inside, maybe it's possible.

363
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,370
Idiot. There's no such cartoon-like water.

364
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,170
There is.

365
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,670
Super-cooled water.

366
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,870
Water is supposed to freeze when it reaches freezing point.

367
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,170
However, this water remains unfrozen

368
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,570
even after reaching below 0 degree Celcius.

369
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,570
When stimulated by the impact of vibration or such,

370
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,270
it will suddenly begin to freeze.

371
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,770
The method to make it is to wrap a towel

372
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,970
around the PET bottle so that it chills evenly.

373
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,970
Leave it in a freezer at around -5 degrees Celcius

374
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,270
for four to five hours.

375
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,770
When impact is applied,

376
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,770
it will start freezing from the top

377
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,570
and all along the face of the PET bottle.

378
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,270
Ms. Kotone probably put the key

379
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,170
into the super-cooled sports drink in the PET bottle,

380
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,570
applied impact to it,

381
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,170
then turned it upside down when the top part started to freeze.

382
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,370
Therefore, the key could flow to the middle

383
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,970
before the entire content was frozen.

384
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,470
Then, she let Ms. Sonoko drink it.

385
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,670
Since sports drink is thickly colored

386
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,170
and looks gel-like when frozen,

387
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,770
the key inside wasn't visible.

388
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,170
Then, if that sports drink is melted...

389
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,870
Yes, I'm sure it'll come out.

390
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,370
The evidence that proves Ms. Kotone had killed Mr. Ishiguri.

391
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,970
Say that after it comes out, will you?

392
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,970
If it doesn't come out, you guys...

393
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,670
It's no use.

394
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,870
Because it'll come out.

395
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,970
The spare key with my fingerprints all over it.

396
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,470
Moreover, I panicked and dropped that key

397
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,570
on top of Ishiguri's blood, too.

398
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,170
No... No way. I drank the drink

399
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,770
that had that stuff in it?

400
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,070
But why did you kill Ishiguri?

401
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,870
Of course, it was to avenge Uryu's death.

402
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,370
I liked him.

403
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,370
Are you talking about the time when Uryu took Ishiguri's joke literally?

404
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,670
It's true that Ishiguri told him that with all the snow,

405
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,270
even if he jumped from the second floor, he wouldn't die.

406
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,970
It was a careless statement that Ishiguri had made.

407
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,570
The night when Uryu's body was carried off,

408
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,770
I couldn't sleep, so I went out to the veranda

409
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,170
and saw Ishiguri digging up the snow.

410
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,770
At first, I thought that he couldn't believe

411
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,170
that Mr. Uryu had died

412
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,270
and was somehow trying to look for him.

413
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,170
But what he was looking for

414
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,770
was the scarf that he had wrapped around his neck.

415
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,870
The smile on his face when he saw it

416
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,470
told the entire story.

417
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,470
Uryu didn't dive into the snow intentionally,

418
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,170
but was rather pushed off.

419
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,870
Don't tell me that Ishiguri...

420
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,270
Yes.

421
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,870
Uryu reflexively grabbed it when he was pushed off.

422
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,470
Ishiguri's scarf.

423
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,570
He was probably going to help him up

424
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,670
after Uryu struggled and got completely exhausted.

425
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,170
However, the new snow that lay 2-meters high

426
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,770
deprived Uryu's energy as if he was in a quicksand.

427
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,770
When we found him, he was already...

428
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,770
But I goofed.

429
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,970
In order to make sure that Ishiguri would eat ice cake for lunch,

430
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,370
I deliberately schemed to slightly hurt a random person

431
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,570
so that I could invite him over to the villa,

432
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,070
in hope that the number of people eating lunch would increase.

433
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,070
I never imagined the racket would hit a child on the head.

434
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,170
Moreover, that child happened to be accompanied

435
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,070
by the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

436
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,270
I may have also been trapped in a quicksand

437
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,570
that sinks deeper the more I struggle

438
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,970
towards my own demise.

439
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,170
Yes, the case was solved.

440
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,170
It's all thanks to the famed Detective Mouri.

441
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,770
Is that so?

442
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,670
By the way, how long to you plan to stick around

443
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,470
with that detective?

444
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,270
You said the detective seems to have some connection with Sherry,

445
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,370
and have wanted to stick around him.

446
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,870
So I tried backing you up in many ways.

447
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,270
I don't think he's of any use to you anymore, is he?

448
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,070
Fortunately, information on Sherry came in,

449
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,970
and you were able to lay her to rest, too.

450
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,170
No. I'm even more interested now

451
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,570
in the detective called the Sleeping Kogoro.

452
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,170
Who are you?

453
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,570
Thanks to you, somebody's going to die.

454
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,870
I was looking outside when I happened to see you.

455
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,570
I felt nostalgic that I decided to call you.

456
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,570
Cut out the joke!

457
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,670
What was that call a while ago about?

458
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,570
Hello, Inspector. This is Mouri.

459
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,470
I have a favor to ask you.

460
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,970
Next Conan, "The Famed Detective is Framed"

Look at him.
