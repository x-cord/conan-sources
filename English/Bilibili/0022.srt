1
00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:05.565
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.305
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:11.055
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:14.605
Today's case is a two-part story
aboard a luxury liner!

5
00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:16.565
Think you can tell who did it
just from Part 1?

6
00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:18.525
There's always only one truth!

7
00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.639
The Luxury Liner Murders, Part 1.

8
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.749
What a beautiful view!

9
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.869
We sure were lucky!
I was worried for a while there!

10
00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:12.709
Yeah!

11
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.789
He forgot what time
our return ship left,

12
00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.549
so we got to ride on
this big one instead!

13
00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.539
It was a good thing this ship
just happened to stop at the island.

14
00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.609
We would've been stranded out
there for 3 days if it hadn't.

15
00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.659
But I wonder what kind of people
would reserve a ship like this...

16
00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.159
Is something the matter?

17
00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.789
No, it's nothing...

18
00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.199
I was just thinking about my parents
who died in an accident last year...

19
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.259
I wish they could've seen me
all dressed up today...

20
00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.409
All dressed up?

21
00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.679
Is something wrong, Natsue?

22
00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.079
Takeshi-san!

23
00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.369
The two of us were married today!

24
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.519
Married?!

25
00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:05.369
We had our ceremony this morning
on Hatamoto Island,

26
00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.869
Shoichi's 2nd daughter Hatamoto Natsue (22)
Natsue's Husband Hatamoto Takeshi (24)
We had our ceremony this morning
on Hatamoto Island,

27
00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.729
the same island you were on!
Shoichi's 2nd daughter Hatamoto Natsue (22)
Natsue's Husband Hatamoto Takeshi (24)

28
00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.579
Congratulations!

29
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.939
But why did you have it on the island?

30
00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.119
The majority of the island
belongs to the Hatamoto family.

31
00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.869
We honor generations
of our ancestors there.

32
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:28.919
It's a Hatamoto family tradition to
hold wedding ceremonies on the island.

33
00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.629
You fool!

34
00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.449
We reserved this boat for ourselves,
so what are strangers doing on it?!

35
00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.449
I'm sorry!

36
00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.389
They appeared to be stranded, so...

37
00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.099
How dare you go over my head!

38
00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.899
Mariko's husband Hatamoto Kitaro (47)
Head of the Hatamoto family Hatamoto Go (72)
You must think pretty highly of yourself

39
00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.399
if you're making decisions without approval.
Mariko's husband Hatamoto Kitaro (47)
Head of the Hatamoto family Hatamoto Go (72)

40
00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.899
No, of course I don't!
Mariko's husband Hatamoto Kitaro (47)
Head of the Hatamoto family Hatamoto Go (72)

41
00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.279
Don't worry about it.

42
00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.899
He's been in a bad mood
since the ceremony today.

43
00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.109
Yes, after he ate my food...

44
00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.359
Uncle Joji!

45
00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.029
I knew he hated Western-style food,
but I had no idea he'd get that angry.

46
00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.499
You call this food?!

47
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.029
Second son of the Hatamoto family
Hatamoto Joji (41)
It seems my skills still aren't up to par.

48
00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.739
Don't say that!
Second son of the Hatamoto family
Hatamoto Joji (41)

49
00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:16.899
It was really delicious!
Second son of the Hatamoto family
Hatamoto Joji (41)

50
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.449
It was really delicious!

51
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.799
Say, lady-killer...
What's with the flower?

52
00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.739
Oh, Natsue put it there on
the way back from the ceremony.

53
00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.989
It's always been my dream
since I was a little girl

54
00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:33.229
to give my beloved this flower
that only grows on that island.

55
00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:33.879
Too bad it wasn't me...

56
00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.739
Kitaro's only son
Hatamoto Ichiro (21)
Too bad it wasn't me...

57
00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:37.979
Kitaro's only son
Hatamoto Ichiro (21)

58
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:41.319
Like father, like son!

59
00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.409
How long are you going to let
him pretend to be an artist?!

60
00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:47.279
You're his father,
talk some sense into him!

61
00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.789
Tell him to give up his hopeless dream!

62
00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.399
Yes!

63
00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:52.369
Takeshi-kun!

64
00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.149
Yes?

65
00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.529
I need a word with you!
Come to my room later!

66
00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.339
Yes, sir...

67
00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.489
Just have patience, dear.

68
00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:08.809
He isn't long for this world--
he'll be gone soon enough.

69
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:15.989
And when he is, nearly all of the
Hatamoto fortune will be yours!
Eldest Hatamoto daughter,
Kitaro's wife, Hatamoto Mariko (43)

70
00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:19.729
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

71
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.279
What's that supposed to mean?!

72
00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.789
Akie-san! Do you know
something I don't?!

73
00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:25.199
Shoichi's daughter & Natsue's sister
Hatamoto Akie (26)
Akie-san! Do you know
something I don't?!

74
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.609
Shoichi's daughter & Natsue's sister
Hatamoto Akie (26)

75
00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:27.989
Don't be too shocked when you hear.
Shoichi's daughter & Natsue's sister
Hatamoto Akie (26)

76
00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.449
Impossible! That can't be true!

77
00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.999
It sounds like Grandfather's
going to make the announcement

78
00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.709
when we get back to Tokyo.

79
00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.029
Akie's husband Hatamoto Tatsuo (26)
Gimme a break.

80
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.549
NDoes he even know we're up to
our necks in debt over here?!
Akie's husband Hatamoto Tatsuo (26)

81
00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.519
We have 24 hours until
the ship arrives in Tokyo.

82
00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:54.479
We simply have to
do something before then...

83
00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:05.169
It's me, Takeshi.

84
00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.189
Enter.

85
00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:10.609
Sorry to disturb you.

86
00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:15.399
That was an exceptional speech
you gave at the wedding.

87
00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.199
Just what I would expect
of the man whom Natsue chose.

88
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.129
Thank you...

89
00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:24.779
Scratching your cheeks
when you're embarrassed...

90
00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:25.839
You're just like him.

91
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.679
Just like your father, Zaiki Isao!

92
00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:35.029
Falsify your family registry all
you want, you still cannot fool me!

93
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.609
I've known all this time
that you joined the company

94
00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:42.449
and got close to Natsue
just to avenge your father!

95
00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:46.029
What is it you're after?

96
00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.489
Money?

97
00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.719
Or my life, perhaps?

98
00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:54.779
What's the matter?
Why won't you speak?!

99
00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:56.539
Answer me!

100
00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.149
These are the main members
of the Hatamoto family.

101
00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:05.919
So all of these people
went to your wedding?

102
00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:09.279
Yes! All nine of them,

103
00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.389
excluding my late parents
Shoichi and Miyuki.

104
00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.199
Say, Takeshi-san is rather late...

105
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.489
Yes. He still hasn't come
back from Grandfather's room...

106
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:19.599
I wonder what happened.

107
00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:23.819
Maybe they're discussing some
under-the-table business!

108
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.029
Akie!

109
00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.349
You're late.

110
00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:33.489
Sorry.

111
00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.699
Dad not here yet?

112
00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:40.669
No, though I am certain he will be here shortly.
Hatamoto family butler Suzuki Kenji (64)

113
00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:42.949
You're late, Ichiro-san!

114
00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:44.389
Did you make sure to wash your hands?!

115
00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:44.959
Yes...

116
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:48.299
Say! Do you have a boyfriend, Ran-san?

117
00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:53.649
Of course not, she's still a kid...

118
00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.149
How rude!

119
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:57.699
I'll have you know
there is someone I like!

120
00:07:57.699 --> 00:07:58.849
Right, Conan-kun?

121
00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.699
Yeah...

122
00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:03.559
What's he like?

123
00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:10.319
Well, he's really smart, good at soccer,
dependable, and cool!

124
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:14.159
What are you acting
so embarrassed about?

125
00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:18.569
And he's an even better
detective than my dad!

126
00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:20.119
You mean your father's a--

127
00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:22.449
Oh? I didn't tell you?

128
00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:24.589
My dad's a detective!

129
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:34.299
Is something the matter?

130
00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:38.449
Keep it a secret from my grandfather!
He hates detectives!

131
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:41.559
He says that people who pry
into others' affairs are despicable!

132
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:45.519
He's right, at least
in old man Kogoro's case.

133
00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:50.409
Sir? Your seat is ready, sir...

134
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:53.609
A flower?

135
00:08:58.069 --> 00:09:00.449
Takeshi-san! You're really late!

136
00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:04.669
Sorry, I was thinking
about some things in my room.

137
00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:08.029
Are you alright? You look pale.

138
00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:12.279
Oh? What happened to your flower?

139
00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:14.509
That's strange.
Where could I have lost it?

140
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:19.489
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

141
00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:20.599
Everyone is waiting for you--

142
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.679
Whose voice was that?!

143
00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:25.519
The butler's!

144
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.149
It came from Dad's room!

145
00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:31.189
What happened, Suzuki-san?!

146
00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:44.489
It's too late. He's dead.

147
00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:45.249
No!

148
00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:46.029
Grandfather!

149
00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:46.829
Stop!
Grandfather!

150
00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:48.289
Everyone stay out!

151
00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:52.789
Nobody's to enter this room
until I say it's okay!

152
00:09:56.859 --> 00:10:01.099
It would seem that 40 or 50 minutes
have passed since Gozo's death.

153
00:10:01.739 --> 00:10:05.649
You were the one
who found him, Suzuki-san?

154
00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:07.319
Yes.

155
00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:12.319
Where were you 40 to 50 minutes ago,
around 8:00 PM?

156
00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:16.449
I was getting things
ready for dinner at 8:00,

157
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.109
so I was in the dining room
the entire time.

158
00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:23.289
I did see Suzuki-san working
in a hurry around the tables!

159
00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:28.359
The door to this room was locked
when you found the body, correct?

160
00:10:28.359 --> 00:10:29.239
Yes.

161
00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:31.529
What ways are there to lock the door?

162
00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:32.799
It can be locked from the inside,

163
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.259
but you need this key
to lock it from the outside.

164
00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:41.009
And this window doesn't open, so it's
impossible to sneak into the room.

165
00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:44.809
In other words,
this room was impregnable!

166
00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.779
Impregnable?!

167
00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.769
You're saying that my grandfather
committed suicide?!

168
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.899
But it's strange.

169
00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:56.819
If it was a suicide, then there's
something important missing here.

170
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.279
The weapon.

171
00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:03.359
He died of blood loss after
being stabbed in the abdomen.

172
00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:06.249
But the knife used to do it
is nowhere to be found.

173
00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.569
Are you sure it wasn't a dagger
made of ice or anything?

174
00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:12.959
Mystery novels are full of things
that melt away and stuff.

175
00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:16.379
Would someone seriously commit suicide
with something like that?

176
00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:19.819
I bet this is more of his harassment.

177
00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:24.529
He wanted to torment us by making
every Hatamoto here seem suspect!

178
00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:28.239
He hated everyone
in the family, after all.

179
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:31.149
Everyone except Natsue-san, that is.

180
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.609
Akie!

181
00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:35.319
I wouldn't put it past the old man...

182
00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:38.149
Then it's decided! It was a suicide!

183
00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:39.239
This was a murder.

184
00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:39.909
What?!

185
00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:42.369
And an extremely simple one, at that.

186
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.569
You, again?!

187
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:48.249
Here, take a close look
at the doorframe!

188
00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:49.959
See the blood?

189
00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:54.109
If the door was closed
when he committed suicide,

190
00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:56.779
none of his blood
could have landed there.

191
00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:01.739
So it's more natural to think that
he was stabbed while the door was open.

192
00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:07.779
That's it! Somebody stabbed Gozo
the instant he left the room!

193
00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:11.069
Then who locked the door?

194
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:12.899
No clue...

195
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.649
Hey, you sure you're a detective?

196
00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:27.289
That's it! It was Mr. Gozo himself
who locked the door!

197
00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:33.989
Someone stabbed him outside the room
and then kept coming for him,

198
00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:36.399
so he locked himself inside
to escape his attacker!

199
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.419
But then he ran
out of strength and died!

200
00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:41.629
I see. That would make the most sense.

201
00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:45.319
You're such a great detective!

202
00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:52.149
Wait a minute! That means everyone
had an opportunity to kill him!

203
00:12:52.149 --> 00:12:54.279
The murder took place
at approximately 8:00.

204
00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:58.649
Ran, Conan, Natsue-san,
and I were at our table since 7:30,

205
00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:00.149
so none of us could have done it!

206
00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:05.239
The same can be said for Suzuki-san,
who was near our table at the time.

207
00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:08.699
In other words, since the killer
wasn't in the dining room at the time...

208
00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:13.489
...it was one of you seven!

209
00:13:25.676 --> 00:13:26.886
Suzuki-san.

210
00:13:26.886 --> 00:13:30.886
When you entered the room, did you
notice anything out of the ordinary?

211
00:13:30.886 --> 00:13:33.136
No, nothing in particular...

212
00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:36.706
Oh, now that you mention it, I found
this flower in front of the door...

213
00:13:37.256 --> 00:13:38.556
Flower?

214
00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:43.756
That's the flower I put on
Takeshi-san's jacket!

215
00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:50.216
Come to think of it, you were really
late coming to the dining room.

216
00:13:51.006 --> 00:13:54.306
No, I was just thinking
about things in my room...

217
00:13:54.306 --> 00:13:57.436
Don't try to deny it, Takeshi-san.

218
00:13:57.846 --> 00:14:04.106
I happened to hear you
and Father shouting in his room!

219
00:14:06.056 --> 00:14:09.806
I thought I was going to faint

220
00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:14.456
when I heard that you're
actually the son of Zaiki Isao!

221
00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:21.166
Who's Zaiki Isao?

222
00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:29.636
He committed suicide when Gozo
took over his company 10 years ago.

223
00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:34.386
One year later,
his wife died of an illness,

224
00:14:34.386 --> 00:14:39.356
and their only son was apparently
placed in an institution.

225
00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:42.426
To think that that was Takeshi-kun!

226
00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:45.216
Is it true, Takeshi-san?!

227
00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:46.316
Takeshi-san!

228
00:14:47.966 --> 00:14:52.486
Yeah. I'm Zaiki Takeshi,
son of Zaiki Isao!

229
00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:58.006
But I...!

230
00:14:58.006 --> 00:15:02.556
...Got close to Natsue-san
so you could avenge your father?

231
00:15:02.556 --> 00:15:04.886
You decided to become a member
of the Hatamoto family

232
00:15:04.886 --> 00:15:07.926
and wait for the chance to kill Gozo.

233
00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:12.306
And then tonight, you did just that!

234
00:15:13.216 --> 00:15:15.096
No! I didn't kill him!

235
00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:19.756
Natsue! Wait!

236
00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:24.506
I had you pegged as
a pretty staunch fellow,

237
00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:26.806
but it looks like I was wrong.

238
00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:28.506
Joji-san!

239
00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:31.406
You gotta be an idiot to drop
your flower at the crime scene!

240
00:15:32.006 --> 00:15:34.156
I didn't, I lost my flower somewhere!

241
00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:37.576
There are wiped blood stains
on the outside carpet...

242
00:15:38.006 --> 00:15:41.216
Say, was that flower
really here on the floor?

243
00:15:41.216 --> 00:15:43.446
Yes, that's right, little boy.

244
00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:48.216
What's this?

245
00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:51.176
A bread crumb!

246
00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:54.426
A bread crumb lying
in a pool of blood?

247
00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:55.636
What's it mean?!

248
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:59.306
Say, Mr. Butler.

249
00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:03.856
Was there bread during the
wedding banquet this afternoon?

250
00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:08.846
But of course--it was an
extravagant French meal.

251
00:16:08.846 --> 00:16:14.216
Joji-sama made it all himself.
He runs his own French restaurant.

252
00:16:14.216 --> 00:16:15.626
Did everyone eat it?

253
00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:18.076
Yes. Everyone but Gozo-sama.

254
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.926
He loathed Western-style food.

255
00:16:20.926 --> 00:16:25.386
He said that just looking
at bread would make him nauseous.

256
00:16:25.386 --> 00:16:29.346
If Joji-san's a chef, he has
kitchen knives of his own, right?

257
00:16:29.346 --> 00:16:33.886
Naturally. Chefs like him
always own their own set.

258
00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:38.096
Come now, children shouldn't
pry into other people's business.

259
00:16:41.096 --> 00:16:41.556
Get in there!

260
00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:45.396
Cool off in this storeroom for a while.

261
00:16:46.216 --> 00:16:49.526
Open up! Please!

262
00:16:49.846 --> 00:16:51.886
Don't be stupid, you murderer!

263
00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.886
We're giving you to the police
the minute we arrive in Tokyo tomorrow!

264
00:16:54.886 --> 00:16:55.986
Better get ready!

265
00:16:56.756 --> 00:17:01.136
His motive and all the evidence is
more than enough, right, Detective?

266
00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:03.006
He had more than enough motive.

267
00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:07.836
And if his fingerprints are found
on the murder weapon, it's in the bag.

268
00:17:08.386 --> 00:17:09.446
Here you are.

269
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:10.796
Thank you!

270
00:17:11.426 --> 00:17:12.936
Here you go, little boy.

271
00:17:12.936 --> 00:17:14.256
Thank you!

272
00:17:14.886 --> 00:17:17.596
You sure are lucky, Mariko.

273
00:17:17.596 --> 00:17:20.556
Now that Takeshi-san
has killed the old man,

274
00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:24.266
he'll never make that stupid
announcement about his inheritance!

275
00:17:25.676 --> 00:17:27.006
That's true.

276
00:17:27.006 --> 00:17:28.476
Now the Hatamoto Group
will belong to you,

277
00:17:28.966 --> 00:17:31.936
the husband of his eldest daughter!

278
00:17:32.596 --> 00:17:34.596
And you can draw as much as you want,

279
00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.316
now that your grandfather's dead,
Ichiro-san!

280
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:40.056
And eventually, you too will
become the Hatamoto Group's--

281
00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:42.496
I don't really want that...

282
00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:46.956
Hey, you ain't thinkin' of monopolizing
the guy's inheritance, are ya?

283
00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:50.386
Don't worry! All you
grandchildren will get--

284
00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:54.876
Could you not talk about money
on the night of our father's death?

285
00:17:56.136 --> 00:18:00.716
Who're you to talk? You left
the family to go be a chef!

286
00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:06.256
I know that Father flat out refused you

287
00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:08.396
when you asked to borrow
money for your restaurant!

288
00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:14.426
You wanted his money too!
So be grateful!

289
00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.276
Um...

290
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:18.846
I'm extremely sorry to say this,

291
00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:21.236
but your father wrote up a will

292
00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:25.806
just in case something
was to happen to him...

293
00:18:25.806 --> 00:18:27.136
What?!

294
00:18:27.136 --> 00:18:31.206
I believe it will be read at the
main office in the next few days.

295
00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:33.226
Does that mean--?

296
00:18:33.226 --> 00:18:34.296
All of his fortune goes to--

297
00:18:35.596 --> 00:18:37.256
Natsue?!
Natsue?!

298
00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:38.556
Yes.

299
00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:41.966
And leadership of the Hatamoto Group
is to be given to the man

300
00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:42.966
that Natsue-san chose.

301
00:18:43.846 --> 00:18:45.136
This can't be!

302
00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:50.606
What? Then what the hell
did I marry Akie for?!

303
00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:55.096
Don't tell me you only married me
to get my dad's money!

304
00:18:55.096 --> 00:19:00.066
That's right! Why else would I live
with a tight-fisted bitch like you?!

305
00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:03.466
Who're you to talk?!
You're just a worthless musician!

306
00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:04.906
Go and get a real job!

307
00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:14.556
Natsue-san?

308
00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:18.056
What are you doing out here?

309
00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:21.296
Nothing, just thinking.

310
00:19:23.886 --> 00:19:25.156
About Takeshi-san?

311
00:19:28.426 --> 00:19:33.756
I trusted him...

312
00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:40.566
But he only married me so
he could kill my grandfather!

313
00:19:40.926 --> 00:19:44.676
I'll never trust anyone again!

314
00:19:50.716 --> 00:19:52.636
I trust him.

315
00:19:55.556 --> 00:20:00.346
My gut feeling tells me
that he's not a bad person.

316
00:20:00.346 --> 00:20:02.386
He's the one you chose, after all.

317
00:20:03.096 --> 00:20:04.846
He couldn't possibly be a bad person!

318
00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:07.306
Ran-san...

319
00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.806
Hey, what are you--

320
00:20:13.006 --> 00:20:17.306
Hey, did you hear
anything strange just now?

321
00:20:17.306 --> 00:20:18.776
Did you hear anything, Natsue-san?

322
00:20:18.776 --> 00:20:20.196
No...

323
00:20:20.716 --> 00:20:22.886
No, I did hear something!

324
00:20:22.886 --> 00:20:24.676
The sound of something
falling into the water

325
00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:28.116
and then a weird thud
from the deck below!

326
00:20:29.306 --> 00:20:31.006
Conan-kun!

327
00:20:31.006 --> 00:20:33.426
Wait, Conan-kun! What's going on?!

328
00:20:37.846 --> 00:20:40.136
What's gotten into you two--?

329
00:20:49.556 --> 00:20:52.136
The cause of death was
most likely brain damage

330
00:20:52.136 --> 00:20:53.386
caused by a blow to the head.

331
00:20:53.386 --> 00:20:54.636
Judging from the wound,

332
00:20:54.636 --> 00:20:57.186
the murder weapon was a
steel pipe or something similar.

333
00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:00.636
Who would do something this terrible?!

334
00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:02.806
Don't tell me Takeshi's struck again!

335
00:21:02.806 --> 00:21:05.006
Impossible. He was locked in.

336
00:21:06.136 --> 00:21:06.986
Hey! Conan!

337
00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:11.956
The door's unlocked!

338
00:21:11.956 --> 00:21:13.706
Out of the way!

339
00:21:16.716 --> 00:21:17.666
He's gone!

340
00:22:53.896 --> 00:22:55.346
He wasn't in the storeroom?!

341
00:22:55.686 --> 00:22:59.806
We most certainly locked him inside,
but he's nowhere to be found.

342
00:23:00.056 --> 00:23:07.026
So Takeshi was the one who
killed Father and Tatsuo-san!

343
00:23:07.856 --> 00:23:09.806
The thud that Conan heard

344
00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:12.946
was probably the sound of
the killer hitting Tatsuo-san.

345
00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:14.606
The splash he heard

346
00:23:14.606 --> 00:23:18.786
was either the sound of the murder weapon
being thrown overboard, or...

347
00:23:19.806 --> 00:23:22.766
...the sound of the killer
jumping into the water

348
00:23:22.766 --> 00:23:24.546
after running out of places to hide!

349
00:23:25.686 --> 00:23:27.006
Takeshi-san...

350
00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:29.936
At any rate, there's still
a high possibility

351
00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:32.186
that there's a killer aboard this ship.

352
00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:35.466
Let's all withdraw to
the dining room for now.

353
00:23:35.726 --> 00:23:38.936
Are you saying he could
be trying to kill me?!

354
00:23:39.556 --> 00:23:41.106
Have you forgotten?!

355
00:23:41.106 --> 00:23:44.936
His motive for murder was to
exact revenge on Hatamoto Gozo,

356
00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:47.686
who drove his father
to suicide 10 years ago!

357
00:23:47.686 --> 00:23:49.856
But for all we know...

358
00:23:50.146 --> 00:23:54.826
...he could be trying to kill
everyone in the Hatamoto family!

359
00:24:12.396 --> 00:24:17.016
I know that you have another man!

360
00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:20.386
You're the one who wants
the inheritance the most!

361
00:24:20.976 --> 00:24:23.306
Even Ichiro was mad at him

362
00:24:23.306 --> 00:24:26.106
for tearing up his prize-winning drawing!

363
00:24:26.976 --> 00:24:28.066
Ichiro!

364
00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:30.026
My leg!

365
00:24:30.266 --> 00:24:31.906
This is my knife...

366
00:24:32.976 --> 00:24:36.036
All of these mysteries
are connected by one thread!

367
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:38.266
On the next Conan--

368
00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:41.396
The Luxury Liner Murders, Part 2.

369
00:24:57.848 --> 00:24:59.956
Next Conan's Hint:

370
00:24:59.956 --> 00:24:59.963
Next Conan's Hint:
Sketch book.

371
00:24:59.963 --> 00:25:02.105
Sketch book.
