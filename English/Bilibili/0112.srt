1
00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:04,328
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:06,158
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:08,118
Today's stage is a school at night!

4
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:10,248
Scary rumors flow
through the darkness!

5
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:11,908
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:13,748
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,158
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,441
"The Seven Mysteries of Teitan Elementary."

9
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,201
This school is cursed?

10
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:05,651
Yeah! It's really for reals!

11
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:08,161
The whole school's talking about it!

12
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:12,481
I bet it's just another of those
"Seven Mysteries" every school has.

13
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:15,861
Like pianos that play on their own,
or stairs that increase in number.

14
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,341
This isn't that kind of childish rubbish!

15
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,441
It happened early one morning last week,

16
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,021
when a student went into the art room.

17
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:28,351
She was fond of a
large painting in the art room,

18
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,731
and she went to look at it every morning.

19
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,941
But then she saw it...

20
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:41,281
All eight plaster figures in
the art room were glaring at her!

21
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,691
What do you think? Mysterious, isn't it?!

22
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,661
It was just coincidence.

23
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,941
And it isn't just her!

24
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:53,321
Doesn't there seem to be fewer
students at this school lately?!

25
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,371
I heard there was a cold going around.

26
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:59,341
Who knows, maybe they've all
been cursed by the plaster figures!

27
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:04,691
The story I heard is much
crazier than those plaster figures!

28
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,431
You know that gross
doll in the nurse's office?

29
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:09,891
Oh, the anatomy model?

30
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:17,401
It was running super-fast
through the hallway four nights ago!

31
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:18,811
That's dumb.

32
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:22,521
Hey! Ayumi! Tell him your story, too!

33
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,531
Huh? You saw something too, Ayumi-chan?

34
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:26,491
Y-Yeah.

35
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,151
Anyways, we gotta do a
Junior Detective League investigation

36
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,411
before things get really bad!

37
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,361
K-Kobayashi-sensei!

If you can't behave in my class,

39
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,231
then leave this instant!
Kobayashi Sumiko (26) Class 1-B Homeroom Teacher

40
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,521
Fukumoto-kun! Read the next one!

41
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:47,691
Come on! Quit dilly-dallying!

42
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:48,361
Yes, ma'am!

43
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,301
What's your problem, hag?

44
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:56,271
Totani-sensei was so much better.
She was actually nice.

45
00:03:56,521 --> 00:04:01,231
There's nothing we can do.
She got married and quit her job.

46
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:03,691
This is so lame.

47
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,071
Ayumi-chan?

48
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,031
Eh? You saw a strange person?

49
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,571
Yeah. In this classroom, three nights ago.

50
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,001
Why were you at school at night?

51
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:21,171
I couldn't help it.
I was worried about the fishies.

52
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,361
Fish? You mean them?

53
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:29,971
Yeah. I forgot to feed them that day,
so I came to check on them.

54
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:34,611
And then I saw someone in
this classroom, in the pitch dark!

55
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:38,941
They were wandering around
creepy-like, with a big, white mask on!

56
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:41,021
Did you see their face?!

57
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:45,521
No... I couldn't tell by their voice, either.

58
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,901
They seemed to be mad, though.

59
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:50,361
Why didn't you tell this to a teacher?!

60
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:54,521
I did! I told the assistant principal,
he lives in my neighborhood!

61
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:57,021
He promised to look into it.

62
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,581
So, what did he find out?

63
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:03,981
That's just it... He hasn't come
to school yesterday or today!

64
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:08,591
Kobayashi-sensei and the other
teachers said they haven't seen him,

65
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:13,141
and nobody answered the
doorbell when I went to his house!

66
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,481
Are you sure he isn't in bed with a cold?

67
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,601
He would've contacted
the school if that were the case.

68
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:23,061
As I recall, he lives alone
after his wife passed away...

69
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,941
It... It must be my fault!

70
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:32,031
It's because of what I asked him
that that strange person killed him!

71
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,991
Hey, you! What's all
the ruckus?! Get cleaning!

72
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:44,021
And you'll all take Open House
notices to your sick friends afterward!

73
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,961
Is that clear?!

74
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,421
Yes, ma'am...

75
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:57,181
Oh, Kobayashi-sensei!
Why the pale face?

but you should be more easygoing.

80
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:06,771
No, that isn't the case.

81
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:13,071
Say, Ohata-sensei.
Can I ask you something?

82
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,321
Sure, what is it?

83
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:19,691
Do you know what's happened
to the assistant principal?

84
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:22,981
U-Uhh... I-I don't know!

85
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,821
He's been absent for
two days without notice,

86
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:29,071
but I'm sure he'll
show up sooner or later!

87
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,981
He's hiding something.

88
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:39,111
Darn it! They're all a
bunch of creepy big-shots!

89
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,021
Now, now! Do not
kick the school building so!

90
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:45,231

94
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:55,241
I've shared many hard times with it.
It may as well be my double.

95
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,231
Please be kinder to it.

96
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:03,251
Umm, have you seen
the assistant principal?

97
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:10,801
Secrets will always get out.
He was truly unlucky.

98
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:13,131
It was fate.

99
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,821
Alright! Got it, you guys?!

100
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:24,691
Yeah!

101
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:29,481
We, the Detective League,
will now break into the school...

102
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:33,241
...to solve the many mysteries
that have happened here!

103
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,111
I believe this is the one I left unlocked...

104
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:47,821
Let us in, Conan-kun!
Hey! That's not fair!

105
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:50,231
It's dangerous, so go on home.

106
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,541
Heave... ho!

107
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,301
Okay, okay! I'll let you in!

108
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,981
Schools at night sure are creepy...

109
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,851
Yeah! My heart's pounding!

110
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:08,691
Let's keep this a secret.
If the teachers found out...

111
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,521
No, it's already obvious.

112
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,151
Especially if you're
wearing muddy shoes.

113
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:20,661
Geez. What a nuisance they can be...

114
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,161
Okay! Let's go!

115
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,501
Let's start with the art room!

116
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,571
Yeah!

117
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,651
Yikes! It's pitch-dark!

118
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:40,771
Lights, lights!

119
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,021
Don't!

120
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,681
We'll be spotted
if we turn the lights on!

121
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:48,191
At least bring a flashlight for stuff like this.

122
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,311
I brought one, too!

123
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,611
There they are! The plaster figures!

124
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:03,901
There's a mark where
the desk and figure meet...

125
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,591
It looks like Mitsuhiko's
story wasn't just a rumor.

126
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:12,001
What's that? There's something
stuck to the figure's forehead...

127
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,461
A piece of tape?

128
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,111
I don't think there's anything here.

129
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,981
Then should we check
out the nurse's office next?

130
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,401
Yeah.

131
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:25,571
Let's see... Anatomy model,
anatomy model...

132
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,151
How odd.
I don't see it anywhere.

133
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,691
Don't tell me it's running through
the hallway, like the rumors say!

134
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:38,191
Ayumi-chan!

135
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,361
Ayumi!

136
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:46,911
Ouch...

137
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:51,331
Are you okay, Ayumi-chan?!

138
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,211
Yeah...

139
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:55,651
But I dropped my
handkerchief somewhere...

140
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,441
What's that?

141
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:00,981
A doll! I think
it came from this box!

142
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,941
Hey, yeah! Awesome!

143
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:06,721
Another class must've
used them for a puppet play!

144
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:11,191
But it's strange...
Why is this out here?

145
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:16,861
Yoshida
Look! This Xuanzang doll has the same name as me!

146
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,031
Tsuburaya
And this Sha Wujing has my name!
Yoshida

147
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:20,991
Bah. I'm stuck with Zhu Bajie?

148
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,411
Kojima

149
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,431
The head's ripped off!

150
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,521
It's not just the head!

151
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:30,651
The whole doll is really beat up!

152
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,751
H-Hey! Don't tell me
someone's out to get me?!

153
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,111
It just happens to have your name!

154
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:40,861
Yes! It was probably the name of
the student using it in the play!

155
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,671
No, not necessarily.

156
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:43,411
Look... Edogawa isn't that common of a name.

157
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:47,141
Edogawa
Look... Edogawa isn't that common of a name.

158
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:50,151
Th-Then these are our names?

159
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:56,021
You're not suggesting this is
connected to the drop in students lately?

160
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,231
D-Does that
mean I'm the next to go?!

161
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:04,191
It's not like that!
We're just being misled by the rumors!

162
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:08,081
After all, the plaster
figures were in the art room...

163
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:12,071
...and the anatomy
model is in the nurse's office!

164
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,021
Mitsuhiko!

165
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:21,711
Th-The anatomy model
is in front of the nurse's office!

166
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,071
What?!

167
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,521
What?! I don't see it anywhere!

168
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,351
But I really saw it!

169
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,561
Hey! Conan! Wait up!

170
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,191
See, it's right there!

171
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:44,151
You probably just
saw something else!

172
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:48,531
No. Look at the base of
this anatomy model.

173
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:48,941
Class 1-B, Yoshida Ayumi

174
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,991
The handkerchief Ayumi-chan dropped earlier is stuck under it.
Class 1-B, Yoshida Ayumi

175
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:57,421
In other words, this model moved
after we left the nurse's office.

176
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:00,381
Then... it moved on its own?

177
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:04,301
Don't be stupid.
Someone obviously moved it.

178
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,821
But why would someone do that?!

179
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,011
Don't tell me they're trying to scare us!

180
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:14,011
If that were the case, they wouldn't
have put it back where it was!

181
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:21,521
What a relief that it wasn't a ghost!

182
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:24,071
What's creepier than a ghost

183
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:30,611
is the person sneaking around school,
doing odd things at this hour!

184
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:41,355
Who's there?!

185
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,625
What is it, Conan?!

186
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:46,875
Someone was looking this
way from the opposite window!

187
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:54,635
What? There's no one there...

188
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:56,815
There couldn't have been anyone!

189
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:01,595
I saw the anatomy model from
the window facing the nurse's office!

190
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:06,765
If the intruder heard my scream,
quickly put the anatomy model back,

191
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,645
and then watched
through this window,

192
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:13,575
we would've bumped into
them on our way to the nurse's office!

193
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,975
You must've been seeing things.

194
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,895
No. Someone was definitely here.

195
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,705
See! The window!

196
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:22,875
The window?

197
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,375
See the white smudge?

198
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:29,835
It's proof that someone was
pressed against the window, looking out!

199
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:33,815
Anyway, we're in danger all by ourselves!

200
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,755
Let's get the security guard here!

201
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,355
Let's see, where is there a phone?

202
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:42,895
Oh! There's a phone in the faculty office!

203
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:45,725
Hurry, Conan-kun!

204
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:48,865
Why is the faculty office unlocked?!

205
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,865
Security Guard

206
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,815
He isn't answering?!

207
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,685
Did something happen?!

208
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:02,355
No, he probably just
drank himself to sleep again.

209
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,835
The guy's still at it,
after all these years.

210
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,355
After all these years?

211
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:10,755
Oh, that's what Ran-neechan said.

212
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:17,215
I can't really tell them I'm actually
a graduate of this grade school...

213
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,515
But now what? Nothing's happened,
so I can't call the police.

214
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:25,685
Which means I'll have to...

215
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:34,605
This is the Mori Detective Agency.

216
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:35,865
Oh, Mister?!

217
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:41,355
Oh, Conan! Where are you?
Ran was worried sick!

218
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:45,875
Teitan Elementary School!
Could you come here?

219
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,835
Come to your school?!

220
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:52,185
Don't be stupid! I already
graduated from elementary school!

221
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:56,255
No, I want you and Ran-neechan
to come right away!

222
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,855
Okay! Roger that!

223
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,935
Why does everyone have to be drunk?!

224
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,765
Oh, well. I guess I'll look around the
school more until they come.

225
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,685
Wait, Conan!

226
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:15,145
Hey, who was on the phone?

227
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,115
Hey! Dad!

228
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,035
This is kind of fun!

229
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:25,575
It is?

230
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:28,915
See? It's like we're in a dream!

231
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,045
Wh-What is this smoke?!

232
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,175
B-Blood!

233
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,725
It's not blood. It's just red paint.

234
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:45,475
Paint?

235
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:49,935
Someone's dripping paint onto the handrail!

236
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:55,605
It follows the taped-up
paper and flows down the handrail!

237
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,815
Then what's this smoke?

238
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:02,145
Dry ice for science
experiments, with water added.

239
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,745
I found it at the top of the stairs.

240
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,685
Meaning the intruder
is trying to scare us away?

241
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:10,745
Alright! Let's go up and catch 'em!

242
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:14,185
There's no point.
They'll just get away.

243
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,715
But if that's what they want, then...

244
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:23,565
Wah! Ghosts! Ghosts! I'm so scared!

245
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,815
C'mon, you guys do it, too!

246
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,385
I get it! We're pretending to run away!

247
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,225
Alright!

248
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:43,545
Hey. Can we go out now?

249
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,225
Yeah.

250
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:51,565
What's taking the old
guy so long? What's he doing?

251
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:55,815
What is it?

252
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,035
T-There are people...

253
00:16:58,035 --> 00:16:59,935
...in our classroom!

254
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,795
And it's not just one or two people!

255
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:02,885
What?!

256
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:07,845
There are ten! What are
they doing in that pitch-dark room?!

257
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:10,265
So that's the person Ayumi-chan saw!

258
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:11,895
Huh? They're holding something!

259
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:16,935
Ah! So that's what this is!

260
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,445
Hey, where are you going, Conan?

261
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,905
Isn't it obvious?
To catch the intruder!

262
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,245
Is this safe?!

263
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:32,015
Can we really catch them?

264
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,565
Conan-kun!

265
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:40,225
Okay! This is it!

266
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,935
Let's get some light...

267
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:01,315
Yoshida

268
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:05,935
What's this? That doll from earlier?

269
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,035
Lots of others are set out!

270
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,515
There are plaster figures
against the wall...

271
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:12,495
There's even an anatomy model...

272
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:13,615
Parents
There's even an anatomy model...

273
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:14,815
What's that paper?
Parents

274
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:15,705
"Parents"?
Parents

275
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,125
This reminds me of an Open House...

276
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,515
Yes.

277
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,645
The intruder used the dolls as students

278
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:27,475
and the figures and anatomy model
as parents to practice every night

279
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:30,855
for next week's Open House,

280
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:35,095
while wearing a mask to
keep from being heard outside.

281
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:41,315
Isn't that right, Class 1-B homeroom
teacher hiding under the desk...

282
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,275
...Kobayashi-sensei?!

283
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:49,035
He's right! Kobayashi-sensei!

284
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:58,535
Then the stories about the moving
figures and anatomy model...

285
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:02,355
Were because she
carried them here every night!

286
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:07,005
The running anatomy model
was actually her carrying it hurriedly.

287
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:11,925
But you should really focus
on being nicer to us instead of this.

288
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:16,815
Yes! You should fix
your child-hating attitude first!

289
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:19,145
No, it's just the opposite.

290
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:25,105
I actually like you
students all so much.

291
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:32,185
I adore my students so much that
I couldn't get mad at my last school.

292
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:36,365
But at my first Open House,
I got so nervous that it failed horribly.

293
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:42,435
When one boy made fun of me,
the one next to him started a fight

294
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,295
and they were both seriously hurt.

295
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,255
I didn't want the same
thing to happen at this school,

296
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,845
so I made myself mean
and treated my students strictly.

297
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:58,645
But each time an Open House nears,
those memories come back

298
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:01,015
and make it hard for me to handle.

299
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:04,105
So I would secretly practice
like this every night.

300
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:09,185
You seemed a lot like the boy
who started the fight, Kojima-kun,

301
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,275
so I was especially worried...

302
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,855
Whoops...

303
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,865
So that's why only Genta's doll was beat up.
Kojima

304
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:20,725
But as a result, the students
fear me and call me a hag...

305
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:23,835
Maybe I'm not cut out to be a teacher...

306
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:27,755
That's not true! I know you're nice!

307
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:31,565
You're the only one who waters the flowers

308
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,215
and changes the fish's
water after everyone leaves!

309
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:37,635
Right?

310
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:43,015
Yes. None of the other teachers do that.

311
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:47,355
We were all saying how
rare it is for a hag to do that...

312
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:51,815
Basically, no matter
how much you falsify yourself,

313
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:54,895
there's no fooling children's eyes!

314
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:59,325
Since the truth's out, maybe you
should go back to your real self?

315
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,995
Though in your case, you might
have to fix your nervousness first.

316
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:05,955
I know.

317
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,925
But that was mean of you
to use smoke and paint to scare us!

318
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:14,885
You were the one watching
us through the window, right?

319
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:19,725
No. This is the first time
I saw you kids tonight.

320
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:24,065
After I heard your scream,
I put the anatomy model back

321
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:27,855
and stayed hidden in
the nurse's office for awhile.

322
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:31,355
Then who unlocked
the faculty office door?!

323
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:34,325
The faculty office?
What are you talking about?

324
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,985
I knew it!

325
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:38,105
There really was someone!

326
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:40,155
Wait! Edogawa-kun!

327
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:44,165
There's someone else,
inside the faculty office!

328
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:45,535
There you are!

329
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,455
A-Assistant Principal?!

330
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,185
Wh-What happened to your head?!

331
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:56,005
K-Kobayashi-sensei!

332
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:04,285
The person who tried to scare
us away was the assistant principal.

333
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:10,185
He came here to find the
hairpiece that he lost two days ago

334
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:13,515
when the wind blew
it off in the faculty office.

335
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:20,075
Ohata-sensei created this shocking
scene after opening the window.

336
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:24,105
And so the late-night wig-hunt began, but...

337
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:25,515
I can't find it anywhere.

338
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:26,855
Let's just forget about it.

339
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:30,085
No, no! I can't come to school without it!

340
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:35,895
...In actuality, the principal
might've secretly taken it.

341
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:12,065
It's a perfect alibi...

342
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:16,475
But you gave the
estimated time of death!

343
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:19,025
