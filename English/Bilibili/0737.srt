1
00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:01,357
Here!

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:05,157
Got it!

3
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:06,957
Nice catch!

4
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:09,357
Fantastic, Shinpei!

5
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:10,457
"Shinpei Asakawa (21)" -Okay.

6
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:12,557
Next, it's your turn, Conan!

7
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,557
Here it comes.

8
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:30,457
Come on, stop that...

9
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:32,057
Ma... Matsunosuke?

10
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,957
Matsunosuke...

11
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:36,357
Stop it, Matsunosuke.

12
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:43,157
Good morning, granny.

13
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:44,657
Granny...

14
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:45,657
"Kanae Asakawa (65)" -Shinpei.

15
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:49,657
You're playing from morning without working again?

16
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:52,257
Playing? I'm not really.

17
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:54,457
He wasn't playing!

18
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:58,357
He teaches us how to throw frisbee here every week!

19
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,257
He is really kind!

20
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:04,657
It's the same as playing, isn't it? You're an adult.

21
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:10,457
Thanks to you, even Matsunosuke has learned to catch frisbees.

22
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:13,157
Is that dog's name Matsunosuke?

23
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,357
How cute.

24
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:18,057
Well... you're all soiled.

25
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:21,357
I'll return it to you after it's cleaned.

26
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,357
It's okay, don't worry about it.

27
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:27,857
No, this have to be taken care of nicely.

28
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:31,757
I don't want your parents complaining to me later.

29
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,357
Granny, you're going to eat breakfast, aren't you?

30
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:37,157
Won't you serve me breakfast too?

31
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:38,557
Only after you start working

32
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,357
and repay me the money I lent you.

33
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:43,857
All right.

34
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,057
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

35
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:08,057
are slashed by the light of deduction.

36
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:10,057
Walking the dog along the same route every morning.

37
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:12,057
A slight difference causes an incident.

38
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:13,657
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:15,457
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:17,857
His name is Detective Conan!

41
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:53,704
"Suspicious Promenade"

42
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:58,004
"Kanae Asakawa, Matsunosuke"

43
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:05,704
Granny, are you home?

44
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,404
We came to get Conan's clothes.

45
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:10,004
She doesn't seem to be home.

46
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:12,004
Maybe she's out walking the dog?

47
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,504
I guess so. We should come back again.

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,404
But, it seems like Matsunosuke's sleeping over there.

49
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,304
You're right.

50
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,104
He is sleeping so soundly.

51
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,004
He's not moving at all.

52
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:28,404
Is Matsunosuke sleeping?

53
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:31,404
I was just thinking of giving him a snack.

54
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,304
Who are you?

55
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:35,704
"Tomoko Hirota (52)" -Friend of Kanae.

56
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:38,104
I own Matsunosuke's sibling.

57
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:42,104
What? Matsunosuke has siblings? Do they look alike?

58
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:45,404
Of course. Exactly alike.

59
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:52,904
Hey... Don't tell me...

60
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,604
Conan?

61
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,104
It's open?

62
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,504
Kanae.

63
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:10,704
What's all the fuss about?

64
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:13,704
It's so noisy that I can't concentrate.

65
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:23,704
I told you, we came to get Conan's clothes,

66
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:26,304
and found that Matsunosuke asleep!

67
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:28,404
He won't wake up no matter how much we call him.

68
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:31,004
What? Matsunosuke?

69
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:32,204
It's the dog!

70
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:35,404
The one sleeping in the kennel outside.

71
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:39,404
According to the forensics, it seems to have been drugged.

72
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,004
Drugged?

73
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:45,404
You're Ms. Hirota, a friend of hers, aren't you?

74
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:49,904
Yes, I came to share snacks with the dog.

75
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:52,404
Then...

76
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:55,704
And you're Mr. Kitazawa who lives next door?

77
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:59,404
"Sokichi Kitazawa (54)" -Yes, I was wondering what's going on

78
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,804
because the doorbell kept ringing and I saw this.

79
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:05,604
Do you two know each other?

80
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:07,304
Yes.

81
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:12,104
Ms. Hirota, I hear that you owed Kanae a lot of money.

82
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:17,304
She was always complaining, saying that you wouldn't pay her back.

83
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:20,104
I'll bet you're the one who did it.

84
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:24,004
Speak for yourself. I've heard you were always complaining about her too!

85
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:26,604
You told everyone her dog was too noisy.

86
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:29,304
What? Are you saying that I'm the murderer?

87
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:30,604
Cut out the joke!

88
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:32,104
Speak for yourself!

89
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,504
Well... calm down.

90
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:39,104
Inspector Megure, it seems that between 08:00 to 08:15 this morning,

91
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:42,004
various people at the shopping arcade and park

92
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,904
witnessed Mrs. Asakawa walking her dog.

93
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:47,004
Okay.

94
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:50,704
Do you know the route that Mrs. Asakawa usually walks her dog?

95
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,304
I remember she mentioned that after she leaves home,

96
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:55,104
she goes to the shopping arcade, then heads to the park.

97
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:58,704
Then, she walks along the street and returns home.

98
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:01,704
Yes, she used to say it's best for her

99
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,004
to walk the dog about an hour.

100
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,404
If so...

101
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,304
She left the house before 08:00 am,

102
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:12,304
and finished walking her dog and came home at about 09:00 am.

103
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:15,904
She would've been killed after that.

104
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,704
What were the two of you doing during this time?

105
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,304
I was at home playing shogi with an acquaintance.

106
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:24,804
I was at home too.

107
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:27,304
I had the florist deliver me some flowers.

108
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:30,604
And, I asked them to arrange the flowers for me.

109
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:36,004
My jacket is back from the dry cleaners.

110
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,504
A beige spring coat.

111
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:04,004
It's the coat she was wearing when she died.

112
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:07,404
A pack of ready-made food. Is that for her breakfast?

113
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,404
What? But didn't Shinpei say...

114
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,604
Inspector, please come.

115
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:15,004
What's wrong?

116
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,004
Take a look at this.

117
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:18,404
A bandana.

118
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:20,704
Is that a blood stain?

119
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:22,404
Hey, isn't that?

120
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,604
Yes.

121
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,104
Shinpei's bandana!

122
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,704
Shinpei?

123
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,404
Kanae's grandson.

124
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:31,704
Inspector Megure!

125
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:35,304
She says she saw a man flee from this house.

126
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:36,604
What?

127
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:40,304
I'm sorry, will you repeat what you told me a while ago?

128
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,904
Yes, sir.

129
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,604
I think it was after 09:00 am,

130
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,704
a young man came out of this house.

131
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:50,704
He looked stark pale and fled.

132
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:54,904
I remember that he is Mrs. Kanae's grandson.

133
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:59,104
Do you know where he lives?

134
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:02,704
I heard that he was living on his own in an apartment nearby.

135
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:06,004
Okay, let's interrogate him right away.

136
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,904
Yes, sir.

137
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,004
Impossible!

138
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:11,704
Shinpei would never commit murder!

139
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:14,304
It's some kind of mistake!

140
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:20,104
How terrible to call Shinpei the murderer!

141
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:24,404
He was so passionate about teaching us how to throw frisbees...

142
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:28,204
It's not possible! No way!

143
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:29,704
Hey, Genta!

144
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,104
What's with you at a time like this?

145
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,104
It's not me.

146
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:38,904
Shinpei?

147
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:40,504
Conan?

148
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:44,104
Hey, you! The police are looking for you.

149
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:46,404
About granny, right?

150
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:50,004
Yes, they say you're the murderer.

151
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,504
No, I'm not! I didn't do it!

152
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:58,104
But, you fled from the site, didn't you?

153
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:02,104
Well, granny texted me to come over.

154
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:03,704
But when I got there, she was already...

155
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,504
I rushed outside and bumped into somebody.

156
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:10,004
I have no idea what happened after that.

157
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:12,704
Shinpei, you mentioned that granny will having breakfast

158
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:15,404
was after she finished walking Matsunosuke, didn't you?

159
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:17,504
What? Yes.

160
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:20,704
She used to say she felt better eating after exercising.

161
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,704
Here he is!

162
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,604
No! It's not me!

163
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,704
Shinpei got caught!

164
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,404
Hey, Conan!

165
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,404
Why aren't you doing anything about it?

166
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,104
I've got no choice, right?

167
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:43,804
Shinpei's bandana was at the site of the crime

168
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:45,804
and there's even a witness.

169
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,404
No way.

170
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:50,904
Do you think that Shinpei is the murderer, too?

171
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:52,304
I despise you!

172
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,504
But...

173
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:57,904
There's a continuation to your story, isn't there?

174
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,504
Sort of...

175
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:01,704
First of all, the bandana that was found at the site

176
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,904
is not something special

177
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,904
so anyone could get one if they wanted to.

178
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:13,704
I see. It could be the real murderer put it there to frame Shinpei.

179
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:15,904
But that won't be enough.

180
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:18,004
I found a plastic bag with a tag

181
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:21,704
from the dry cleaners in the trash box at the site.

182
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:27,904
"Woman's beige spring coat" is written on the tag.

183
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:31,304
A beige spring coat?

184
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,304
The coat that granny was wearing when she died!

185
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,404
Right.

186
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,704
And under that plastic bag,

187
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:40,804
a pack of ready-made food for breakfast was disposed.

188
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:44,104
A pack of ready-made food for breakfast under the plastic bag?

189
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,404
Which means she disposed of the pack of food for breakfast first, right?

190
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:51,904
So, she took Matsunosuke for a walk after she ate breakfast.

191
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:55,004
It's the other way around...

192
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:56,404
Exactly!

193
00:11:56,404 --> 00:12:01,404
According to Shinpei, granny always eats breakfast

194
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,104
after finishing her walk with Matsunosuke,

195
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:06,004
but the circumstances at the site shows that it was the other way around.

196
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:10,304
In other words, there's a possibility that someone manipulated the scene.

197
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:14,304
But what if Shinpei's lying?

198
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:16,104
No way.

199
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:20,504
He talked about granny's breakfast last week too, didn't he?

200
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,204
Granny, you're going to eat breakfast, aren't you?

201
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,204
Won't you serve me breakfast too?

202
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,004
If that was a lie,

203
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:29,704
he must've planned the crime in advance.

204
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:33,404
So, he would never drop a blood stained bandana there, right?

205
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:34,904
You might be right.

206
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,904
Then who could've done it?

207
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:40,104
The only suspects we have right now are her friend, Ms. Hirota,

208
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,704
and her next door neighbour, Mr. Kitazawa.

209
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:44,104
But, both of them have alibis.

210
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:47,404
Then, why don't we investigate whether their alibis are true?

211
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:52,004
I see! If we do so, Shinpei may be able to come back!

212
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,304
It's showtime for the Youth Detective Squad!

213
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:55,404
-Yes! -Yes!

214
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:57,104
I'll start with Mr. Kitazawa's house.

215
00:12:57,104 --> 00:13:00,104
Then we'll go and ask around the shopping arcade.

216
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,821
No waiting, okay?

217
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,321
Shut up! I know!

218
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,321
Here it comes! There!

219
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,321
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,421
Our frisbee went inside, could you pick it up for us?

221
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:28,721
Geez...

222
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,021
I'm so sorry.

223
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,321
Okay...

224
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,321
Go around to the front door.

225
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,821
I'm sorry, sir. The frisbee...

226
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:40,821
You're playing shogi!

227
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,421
Good match!

228
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,321
Since when have you been playing?

229
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,821
From this morning!

230
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,821
Amazing!

231
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,121
I've won 99 games and lost 99 games

232
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,421
in the past 10 years!

233
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,121
Today is the day to decide who the stronger player is.

234
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,121
We've been playing against each other

235
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:59,821
from 06:00 in the morning non-stop.

236
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,821
You're on the verge of losing.

237
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,621
Shut up! Don't get in the way of our game!

238
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:07,321
I'm... I'm sorry!

239
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,821
Yes, at 08:30 am!

240
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:15,821
I was told by Ms. Hirota to deliver the flowers then.

241
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,021
Arrangement and all?

242
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:20,821
Yes, since there were a lot of flowers,

243
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,321
it took till about after 12:00 pm.

244
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,121
I see.

245
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,821
Their alibis were fully established after all.

246
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,221
So, what now, Conan?

247
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:37,221
They're going to make Shinpei the murderer.

248
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:42,221
Maybe the prerequisite circumstance was wrong to begin with.

249
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,521
Prerequisite circumstance?

250
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:47,721
I first thought that victim was killed

251
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:52,021
after she came back from her walk with Matsunosuke.

252
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,521
Just what do you mean?

253
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,121
Granny used to walk the dog along the same road

254
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,021
at the same time every morning.

255
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:01,721
That's why maybe...

256
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:04,121
I see! The people who witnessed her

257
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:07,021
may have thought they saw her like always today too!

258
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:11,621
Oh, the woman wearing the beige coat walking the dog, right?

259
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,821
I saw her this morning too.

260
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,821
Are you sure it was this morning?

261
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:18,421
Yes, It must've been after 08:00 am.

262
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:22,021
We always go pass each other when I walked my dog.

263
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,121
That dog always marks that pole.

264
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,821
But, it seems that she was in a rush today

265
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,821
and pulled forcibly on the dog then took him with her.

266
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,821
Yes.

267
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,821
The lady that walks her dog every morning, right?

268
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:36,921
I saw her.

269
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,021
They really had it out this morning.

270
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,421
Had it out?

271
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:44,821
That dog always fights with a cat in front of this store.

272
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,421
This morning it was really bad.

273
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:51,721
She's been trying to keep the dog away from the cat these days

274
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,321
but it seems she was a bit off her guard.

275
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,121
It takes 15 minutes to get here from her house.

276
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,821
Everybody's saying that the she went by with the dog.

277
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:05,721
Which means they weren't just imagining.

278
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,121
Ma'am.

279
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,321
Yes. What is it?

280
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,321
Did you see a woman walking her dog around here this morning?

281
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:23,521
What? The police asked me the same thing.

282
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,221
I did, I'm sure of it.

283
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:29,821
Was that woman pulling the dog along with force?

284
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,621
With force?

285
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,621
Yes, it did seem like she was.

286
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:38,521
She always goes left after leaving the park.

287
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:40,221
But, this morning,

288
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,821
she pulled her dog along as she turned right.

289
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,721
She pulled it to the right?

290
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,521
Hold on, Conan.

291
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:50,121
This is opposite the walking course.

292
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:53,321
There's no way we can find witnesses then.

293
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:00,421
This is...

294
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,921
Oh, it's you kids.

295
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,821
Are you still looking for eye-witnesses?

296
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:09,321
Oh, you're the one we saw a while ago.

297
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:13,321
I couldn't tell who you were because you didn't have your dog with you.

298
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:17,021
I see! I get the picture.

299
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:19,421
Everybody's made a mistake.

300
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,121
Even the witness...

301
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,321
and the murderer too.

302
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:28,321
Then there's one place the murderer will have to go...

303
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:33,421
in order to hide the vital evidence.

304
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,721
Good evening.

305
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:49,921
Why are you here so late?

306
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,121
You kids.

307
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:57,421
Ma'am. We figured out the real murderer

308
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,621
that killed Mrs. Kanae.

309
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,321
The murderer killed Mrs. Kanae

310
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:08,421
who finished preparing her breakfast before 08:00 am.

311
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,121
After that, the murderer cleaned up the breakfast that was prepared

312
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:16,421
and dressed her in the coat that had just came back from the dry cleaners

313
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:20,121
to make it look as if she was killed after she walking her dog.

314
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,421
Then the murderer put Shinpei's bandana

315
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:26,021
that had prepared beforehand at the front entrance,

316
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:31,021
disguised as Mrs. Kanae and took Matsunosuke for a walk.

317
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:35,721
To create eye-witnesses believe that she was walking Matsunosuke,

318
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:38,821
and establish the alibi...

319
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,821
Of course, it was a simple disguise,

320
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,421
so they might've been found out if someone paid attention,

321
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:47,821
but they were all deceived by having Matsunosuke along.

322
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,121
The dog pees and marks the usual place,

323
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:53,321
fights with the cat as usual.

324
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:58,321
So, everyone believes it's the granny walking Matsunosuke as usual.

325
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:05,021
But the murderer turned right after leaving the park.

326
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,321
Though granny's always turns left.

327
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:11,421
Of course, because if the murderer walking the dog as usual,

328
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:14,321
she wouldn't be able to establish the alibi.

329
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:19,021
The murderer who left the park, went home along with Matsunosuke,

330
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:23,221
met the person she had summoned and completed her alibi.

331
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,821
Hold it there. What about the dog?

332
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,921
What about Matsunosuke?

333
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:30,621
Back then, Matsunosuke was asleep over here, wasn't he?

334
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,421
The murderer couldn't have taken him.

335
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,621
It was a fake.

336
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:37,421
The dog that was drugged to sleep back then

337
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:41,321
was a fake Matsunosuke that the murderer got ready.

338
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,621
This means that the murderer owns a dog

339
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:46,121
that looks like Matsunosuke!

340
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:50,621
You said you own one of Matsunosuke's siblings, right?

341
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,921
One that looks exactly like Matsunosuke.

342
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:56,321
In other words, you're the only one who could be the murderer,

343
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,321
Ms. Tomoko Hirota!

344
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,621
Conan.

345
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:02,621
Inspector!

346
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:07,621
Please help me. These kids suddenly saying strange things.

347
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:10,921
We came because Mr. Mouri contacted us.

348
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:16,521
Yes! He couldn't come because of something urgent

349
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:19,421
so he told us to come and tell you instead.

350
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:23,721
I see. I hope you have evidence though.

351
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,821
That's right! Evidence!

352
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,721
Show the proof!

353
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,721
The proof is right there.

354
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,121
The dog that you switched with your own,

355
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:37,021
the real Matsunosuke!!

356
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:39,721
How about it, Ms. Hirota?

357
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,421
No, they're wrong!

358
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,321
This is my dog!

359
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,421
Matsunosuke is tied up over there.

360
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:48,421
Hey, Matsunosuke!

361
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,421
Here it comes!

362
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:00,121
-He did it! -He did it!

363
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:05,921
Ma'am.

364
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,921
I'll bet you think that we got to the truth because of the dog?

365
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,621
But, that's what it is, right?

366
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:14,321
If that stupid dog didn't go after that frisbee...

367
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:16,521
You're wrong.

368
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:19,521
After you killed Mrs. Kanae,

369
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:22,421
you cleaned up the breakfast and put the coat on her.

370
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,421
Then you set the place up to make it look as if she was killed

371
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:26,721
after she came back from walking her dog.

372
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:31,121
That was your biggest mistake.

373
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:34,121
Mrs. Kanae always used to eat breakfast

374
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,921
after walking her dog.

375
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,021
That's why if she was killed right after she got home,

376
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:43,521
the breakfast preparation would've had to be left as is.

377
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:46,621
And if she was killed after she ate breakfast,

378
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:50,721
it would be strange for her to still be wearing the coat.

379
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:52,721
In other words, that site

380
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,721
was a site full of awkward, unnatural settings.

381
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:22,121
But I'm glad that we found the real murderer.

382
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,421
We can have Shinpei teach us to throw frisbee again.

383
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:28,121
That's right. I can't wait!

384
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,121
You even got your jacket back all clean.

385
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:36,621
Yes, Matsunosuke's footprints are all cleaned off...

386
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,321
I'm sorry, Conan.

387
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,621
I'll take it to the dry cleaners again.

388
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:48,821
No, don't bother already.

389
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,421
"Next Episode" -Here you go, detective!

390
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,821
Drink this for the time being.

391
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:59,621
You'll soon lose track of what's real and what's not

392
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:00,721
and end up being cooped up,

393
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:03,321
then eventually hang yourself to death!

394
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,821
Mr. Usuda's not moving as if he's dead!

395
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:15,021
He's really dead.

396
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,421
Next Conan,

397
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:20,421
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 1)"

398
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,421
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,421
"Champagne"

400
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:42,721
What's champagne?

401
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:46,121
-It's bubbly wine. -It doesn't match Pops.
