1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.570
Pops Kogoro is asked to serve as singer idol Risa Purple's bodyguard,

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.270
Ran and I are also invited to her live concert.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.170
At that event, two men mistook Ran for Risa, kidnap and take her away.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.370
Pops and I pursue the kidnappers

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.870
and we figure out their hideout

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.370
but what we find there is

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.370
the plan that the kidnapper and Risa Purple had planned.

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.870
"Mr. Takeyama, please save me."

9
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.070
"Please carry me out of the live concert hall on the day of the event"?

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.070
"Set the fire alarm off and cause a commotion"?

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.670
This is the blueprint of today's event hall.

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.570
It seems that Takeyama mailed her back 15 minutes ago.

13
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.070
"Risa, I've mistakenly kidnapped the wrong person."

14
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.970
"What shall I do?"

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.270
If you made a mistake,

16
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.370
just release her right away!

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.670
No. Ran most probably won't be set free.

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.070
On the contrary,

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070
it hard to believe that they would let her free

20
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.670
after she's seen their faces and all.

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.770
Those who have no set plan

22
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.570
are more prone to make irrational moves on impulse.

23
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.770
Even if means taking action that would threaten a person's life.

24
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.370
A canvas stained black with crime.

25
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.570
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

26
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.070
Ran Mouri is kidnapped.

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.670
What's the gamble that was used to save her life?

28
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.270
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.870
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:26.827
"The Great Pursuit of Enraged Kogoro (Part 2)"

32
00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:34.827
Take custody of Risa Purple immediately!

33
00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:37.727
If she's the one who schemed this plan,

34
00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.027
she should know where this place is!

35
00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:42.827
Inspector Megure is interrogating Risa now.

36
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:44.027
Too time consuming!

37
00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:46.727
I'll go ask her myself!

38
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.327
Brat, let's go!

39
00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:52.027
Hey, the picture on this Face Net is a bit strange.

40
00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:53.127
Picture?

41
00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:54.727
All her pictures in the posters

42
00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.427
are facing the left side of her face to the camera, right?

43
00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:58.727
So, what?

44
00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:03.727
Risa Purple's charm point is her mole under her left eye.

45
00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:08.527
So she faces her left side to the camera every time.

46
00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:11.527
But this picture is taken from the right side.

47
00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:14.827
It's strange that she would put a picture like this on the net.

48
00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:18.127
Which means Risa's imposter or something

49
00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:21.527
was corresponding by mail with Takeyama?

50
00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:28.127
The answering machine.

51
00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:30.227
Come to think of it, there was a message asking for her to call back.

52
00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:32.927
It was written on Takeyama's Face Net.

53
00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:38.727
Risa's imposter maybe is planning to insert a message or something.

54
00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:40.927
I'm not home right now.

55
00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:43.727
Please leave a message after the tone.

56
00:04:46.627 --> 00:04:48.527
The PIN code is being pushed.

57
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:51.127
The perpetrator's trying to listen to the message from outside.

58
00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:54.727
-What? -No new message has been recorded.

59
00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.727
Darn it!

60
00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:58.627
Hey, where's Ran?

61
00:04:58.627 --> 00:05:00.027
She'd better be all right!

62
00:05:00.027 --> 00:05:01.927
Hey, answer me!

63
00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:09.127
The perpetrator's found out about us.

64
00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:12.327
So, the perpetrator will never call again.

65
00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:15.527
What now?

66
00:05:15.527 --> 00:05:18.227
It's him! It's that man!

67
00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:21.027
He's the guy that came chasing us from the live event hall!

68
00:05:21.027 --> 00:05:22.327
"Takichi Takeyama (43)" -Yosaburo!

69
00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:25.627
We're in this mess because you made a mistake!

70
00:05:25.627 --> 00:05:30.427
"Yosaburo Ihara (28)" -But unlike you, I don't care about Risa Purple.

71
00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:32.527
I don't even know what she really looks like either.

72
00:05:32.527 --> 00:05:34.727
Stop insulting Risa!

73
00:05:34.727 --> 00:05:36.027
What are you doing?

74
00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:38.627
If we get caught,

75
00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:43.327
we're going to get Risa in trouble.

76
00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:50.327
Don't worry about it.

77
00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:52.927
They'll never find this place.

78
00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:57.927
I... I can't breathe.

79
00:05:59.127 --> 00:06:02.527
Dad. Conan.

80
00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:03.927
Help me.

81
00:06:08.627 --> 00:06:11.127
"Risa Purple (21)" -I don't use Face Net.

82
00:06:11.127 --> 00:06:14.627
I never sent my fans such comments or messages!

83
00:06:14.627 --> 00:06:18.327
Right! I'm sure it's an imposter!

84
00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:21.227
Risa's finally starting to gain popularity!

85
00:06:21.227 --> 00:06:23.727
She would never gain anything

86
00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:25.327
"Ginji Yamane (38)" -from such commotion.

87
00:06:25.327 --> 00:06:26.927
This is nothing more than trouble!

88
00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:34.427
"Junichi Sakuta (43)" -Cut it out won't you!

89
00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.427
Stop filming!

90
00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:40.727
But, this is news that everybody's interested about.

91
00:06:40.727 --> 00:06:44.427
"Bianca (26)" -It is at top rank on the net too.

92
00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:46.927
I'm grateful for your cooperation.

93
00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:51.127
But don't forget that we're still in the process of investigation.

94
00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:53.227
Are you still suspecting us?

95
00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:56.727
Thinking that there's an accomplice among us?

96
00:06:56.727 --> 00:06:58.527
I didn't say that.

97
00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:01.427
I just have to confirm the facts.

98
00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:04.227
Unless someone unlocked the door,

99
00:07:04.227 --> 00:07:09.427
the perpetrator couldn't have pushed the fire alarm.

100
00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:10.627
Mr. Yamane.

101
00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:12.327
You said you went out to the corridor

102
00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:14.327
just before the live started, didn't you?

103
00:07:14.327 --> 00:07:17.227
Yes. Like I said before,

104
00:07:17.227 --> 00:07:19.527
I just went to make a phone call

105
00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:21.927
and didn't unlock the door.

106
00:07:21.927 --> 00:07:24.527
Who are you calling?

107
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.727
At a busy time when the live was about to start,

108
00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:30.427
who are you calling?

109
00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:32.927
Well...

110
00:07:32.927 --> 00:07:35.527
Mr. Yamane, please.

111
00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:38.127
Tell him the truth without hiding anything!

112
00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:43.027
Inspector.

113
00:07:43.027 --> 00:07:45.327
Mouri! Conan!

114
00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.727
The manager was calling the perpetrator, Takeyama.

115
00:07:53.527 --> 00:07:55.527
To Takeyama?

116
00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:58.327
Hey, you! Stop taking me lightly!

117
00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:01.627
I know who you are!

118
00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:04.127
Don't you ever make threatening calls like this again.

119
00:08:04.127 --> 00:08:06.127
Because if you do, you, you're not only ever going to come near again!

120
00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:10.127
I'm going to beat you to a pulp and turn you over to the police.

121
00:08:10.127 --> 00:08:12.727
Understand?

122
00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:14.927
Mr. Yamane.

123
00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.427
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:20.427
I told you not to get rough with my fans, didn't I?

125
00:08:20.427 --> 00:08:24.527
I told you time and again not do that and yet...

126
00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:29.027
Mr. Yamane, why do you know Takeyama's phone number?

127
00:08:29.027 --> 00:08:31.627
When I got the threat calls,

128
00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:33.627
I registered his number.

129
00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:37.127
Of course, I didn't know that it was Takeyama's number.

130
00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:41.527
But I didn't want any bomb threat calls coming in before the live,

131
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:43.227
so I did so, just in case.

132
00:08:43.227 --> 00:08:45.327
When you were making the call,

133
00:08:45.327 --> 00:08:47.927
was there anybody in the corridor?

134
00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:51.027
No, I was alone.

135
00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:55.227
I couldn't see the place where the fire alarm was from where I was.

136
00:08:55.227 --> 00:08:57.927
Therefore, I don't know if anyone was there.

137
00:08:57.927 --> 00:08:59.627
Please try to remember!

138
00:08:59.627 --> 00:09:01.527
It's very important!

139
00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:03.927
Pops, don't get violent!

140
00:09:06.327 --> 00:09:10.027
We've got to specify the place in the picture.

141
00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:12.027
That's right.

142
00:09:12.027 --> 00:09:15.827
Ran is probably here.

143
00:09:15.827 --> 00:09:17.327
Where is it?

144
00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:18.927
I don't know for sure,

145
00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.027
but I think it's the place

146
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:23.127
where Takeyama guys are illegally disposing trash.

147
00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:27.127
The refrigerator that Ran was locked up in was also disposed of here.

148
00:09:27.127 --> 00:09:31.427
We found the area where the perpetrator made the call from.

149
00:09:31.427 --> 00:09:35.127
The base station covers a fairly large area, from Beika Mountain Pass

150
00:09:35.127 --> 00:09:37.127
to the entire area around Teimuzu Valley.

151
00:09:37.127 --> 00:09:40.527
Let's tell them to search from the air on the double using the chopper!

152
00:09:40.527 --> 00:09:41.527
Yes, sir!

153
00:09:41.527 --> 00:09:44.027
But a place where trash is disposed of illegally

154
00:09:44.027 --> 00:09:46.027
is usually not in plain sight.

155
00:09:46.027 --> 00:09:51.727
I think it's difficult to find the place by chopper at night.

156
00:09:51.727 --> 00:09:53.727
Conan's right!

157
00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:56.427
Besides if the refrigerator is sealed tight,

158
00:09:56.427 --> 00:10:00.327
it would only take a short while for oxygen to start lacking!

159
00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:02.927
Ran wouldn't make it out alive by tomorrow morning!

160
00:10:07.827 --> 00:10:11.427
We have 500 officers out searching right now.

161
00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:14.027
But they have no means of searching

162
00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:16.527
unless we can narrow down the search area first.

163
00:10:16.527 --> 00:10:20.027
Inspector, I have an idea.

164
00:10:20.027 --> 00:10:21.427
An idea?

165
00:10:24.027 --> 00:10:27.127
I'll call out to the perpetrator!

166
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.827
I'll implore the perpetrator to save Ran,

167
00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:31.627
to please not take her life.

168
00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:35.427
I'm going to let the perpetrator know how I honestly feel as her father!

169
00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:39.827
We have no choice but appeal to the consciences of the kidnappers.

170
00:10:39.827 --> 00:10:41.927
I understand how you feel

171
00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:44.927
but just how do we call out to the perpetrator?

172
00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:48.627
I've got a favor to ask of you.

173
00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:50.127
A favor?

174
00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:55.327
Will you air my message to the perpetrator on your program?

175
00:10:55.327 --> 00:10:57.427
Our program?

176
00:10:57.427 --> 00:11:01.527
I don't mind but we're cable TV,

177
00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:04.527
so our viewers are limited.

178
00:11:04.527 --> 00:11:08.627
The chances of your message reaching the perpetrator is extremely low.

179
00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:10.827
Even if there's only a slight chance, there's no choice but to try.

180
00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:15.927
Just waiting doing nothing isn't going to save Ran's life!

181
00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:20.227
All right, I'll get to it right away.

182
00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:23.527
Inspector.

183
00:11:23.527 --> 00:11:26.027
Ran's life is at stake.

184
00:11:26.027 --> 00:11:27.927
Do whatever it takes.

185
00:11:27.927 --> 00:11:30.027
Thank you.

186
00:11:30.027 --> 00:11:32.627
Pops. I'm counting on you.

187
00:11:43.927 --> 00:11:46.727
"Rainbow"

188
00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:00.527
Conan.

189
00:12:00.527 --> 00:12:03.127
We're starting soon, so they're asking for you to come in.

190
00:12:03.127 --> 00:12:04.327
Yep.

191
00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:07.827
Risa originally belonged to a group, right?

192
00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:11.227
Yeah. She first belonged to a group of seven.

193
00:12:11.227 --> 00:12:14.927
Then, there were several member changes,

194
00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:17.527
yet popularity was difficult to achieve.

195
00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:25.927
We're going live in three, two...

196
00:12:28.027 --> 00:12:31.327
Ladies and gentlemen, as you may all be familiar with this,

197
00:12:31.327 --> 00:12:37.227
a kidnapping case occurred at the live show of Ms. Risa Purple today.

198
00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:38.427
This is bad!

199
00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:42.427
Risa Purple has been abducted!

200
00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:45.027
Now you're about to see a message

201
00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:47.827
from Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the Father of Ms. Ran Mouri,

202
00:12:47.827 --> 00:12:51.727
who was kidnapped back then, to the kidnappers.

203
00:12:56.827 --> 00:13:00.527
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

204
00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:03.027
We already know that

205
00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:06.527
you mistakenly kidnapped my daughter instead of Risa.

206
00:13:06.527 --> 00:13:10.127
I'm sure my daughter means nothing to you guys.

207
00:13:10.127 --> 00:13:14.427
And you probably think that she's just another nuisance to you.

208
00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:19.527
But to me, she's a precious treasure.

209
00:13:19.527 --> 00:13:22.327
My daughter's still just 16 years old.

210
00:13:22.327 --> 00:13:25.627
Although my daughter tells me nothing,

211
00:13:25.627 --> 00:13:29.127
I'm sure she's hoping for a happy future.

212
00:13:30.927 --> 00:13:33.027
You guys are trying to take that happy future

213
00:13:33.027 --> 00:13:35.627
from my daughter right this minute!

214
00:13:35.627 --> 00:13:37.527
My daughter has done nothing to deserve this!

215
00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:41.727
Please calm down and at least spare her life, I beg you!

216
00:13:41.727 --> 00:13:45.527
I don't want to make murderers out of you.

217
00:13:45.527 --> 00:13:48.227
You may be thinking that so long as you shut my daughter up,

218
00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:51.627
you can get away with what you did,

219
00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:53.727
but you're making a big mistake!

220
00:13:53.727 --> 00:13:58.627
Why? That's because my daughter has proof of you, the kidnapper.

221
00:13:58.627 --> 00:14:00.627
Proof of the kidnapper?

222
00:14:17.994 --> 00:14:20.894
My daughter took pictures everywhere of the live hall,

223
00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:22.494
just before the performance began.

224
00:14:27.594 --> 00:14:29.994
It is highly likely that in one of the pictures taken,

225
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.994
a person who was in a certain place

226
00:14:31.994 --> 00:14:35.294
where nobody should've been was coincidentally taken.

227
00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:37.694
A person who wasn't supposed to be there!

228
00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:43.694
I don't know who that was either.

229
00:14:43.694 --> 00:14:45.494
But, now that I've said all this,

230
00:14:45.494 --> 00:14:48.294
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

231
00:14:48.294 --> 00:14:51.994
If you're the kidnapper, you should also already know that

232
00:14:51.994 --> 00:14:54.494
the picture would serve as undeniable evidence.

233
00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:56.194
A soon as day breaks,

234
00:14:56.194 --> 00:14:59.394
the police will start a search dispatching 500 officers.

235
00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:03.094
They will be asking support from firefighters, the mountain rescue team

236
00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:04.894
and even the Self-Defense Force.

237
00:15:04.894 --> 00:15:06.894
But if at that time,

238
00:15:06.894 --> 00:15:10.194
my daughter is found dead, you're finished!

239
00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:13.994
You'll be burdening yourself with a sin so great

240
00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:16.794
that you'll never be able to compensate for.

241
00:15:16.794 --> 00:15:21.494
Please save my daughter before anything like that happens.

242
00:15:21.494 --> 00:15:23.794
That's my only wish.

243
00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:31.094
That was a fantastic broadcast.

244
00:15:31.094 --> 00:15:33.994
I hope it reaches the perpetrator's conscience.

245
00:15:33.994 --> 00:15:37.194
I don't know if it reached the perpetrator's conscience.

246
00:15:37.194 --> 00:15:41.094
But if evidence is left in Ran's cell phone,

247
00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:46.194
I'm sure they'll make their move tonight to try to get rid of it.

248
00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:49.294
Pops set a trap on the kidnapper.

249
00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:50.594
A trap?

250
00:15:50.594 --> 00:15:53.394
Pops lied saying that Ran took pictures

251
00:15:53.394 --> 00:15:55.894
that would serve as evidence.

252
00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:57.294
Lied?

253
00:15:57.294 --> 00:15:58.994
It's a risky gamble,

254
00:15:58.994 --> 00:16:01.794
but there's no other way to save Ran's life.

255
00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.894
But no matter if you tried setting a trap,

256
00:16:04.894 --> 00:16:08.794
if the kidnapper isn't watching the broadcast, it's not worth anything.

257
00:16:08.794 --> 00:16:10.694
I'm sure the kidnapper's watching.

258
00:16:10.694 --> 00:16:12.094
Right, Pops?

259
00:16:12.094 --> 00:16:14.594
Yeah, I'm positive!

260
00:16:14.594 --> 00:16:15.594
Inspector.

261
00:16:15.594 --> 00:16:17.494
The kidnapper's started to move.

262
00:16:17.494 --> 00:16:18.594
What?

263
00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:38.994
How did you know that he was the kidnapper?

264
00:16:38.994 --> 00:16:42.494
Evidence of it was left in this answering machine.

265
00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:43.494
Right.

266
00:16:43.494 --> 00:16:45.194
Answering machine?

267
00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:55.894
Am I getting bonus, President?

268
00:16:55.894 --> 00:16:59.094
Stop worrying about your bonus and worry about Risa, will you?

269
00:17:00.194 --> 00:17:01.494
Somebody's coming.

270
00:17:01.494 --> 00:17:02.594
Hide.

271
00:17:18.594 --> 00:17:19.594
Yes.

272
00:17:19.594 --> 00:17:23.594
So that ringtone was your phone's after all, Bianca.

273
00:17:25.494 --> 00:17:29.494
When the manager was leaving a message in the answering machine,

274
00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:33.894
That ringtone although really slight was heard.

275
00:17:33.894 --> 00:17:36.494
Hey, you! Stop taking me lightly!

276
00:17:36.494 --> 00:17:39.794
I know who you are!

277
00:17:39.794 --> 00:17:42.394
Don't you ever make threatening calls like this again.

278
00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:44.394
Because if you do, you, you're not only ever going to come near again!

279
00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:48.394
I'm going to beat you to a pulp and turn you over to the police.

280
00:17:48.394 --> 00:17:49.994
Understand?

281
00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:53.694
Understand?

282
00:17:56.094 --> 00:17:58.294
Bianca, what're you doing?

283
00:17:58.294 --> 00:17:59.594
We're starting, you know?

284
00:17:59.594 --> 00:18:01.494
I'll be right there.

285
00:18:01.494 --> 00:18:05.894
That call was from Director Sakuta, wasn't it?

286
00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:07.794
Yeah.

287
00:18:07.794 --> 00:18:10.694
I got worried because Bianca was nowhere in sight

288
00:18:10.694 --> 00:18:11.994
although we were ready to start.

289
00:18:11.994 --> 00:18:14.994
I, Kogoro Mouri, will protect Risa with my life

290
00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:18.494
no matter who attack her.

291
00:18:18.494 --> 00:18:21.094
Bianca. Where were you?

292
00:18:21.094 --> 00:18:22.794
I'm so sorry...

293
00:18:22.794 --> 00:18:24.594
Risa!

294
00:18:24.594 --> 00:18:27.994
I remember you talking that way.

295
00:18:30.594 --> 00:18:34.194
Mr. Sakuta. Did you know this place?

296
00:18:34.194 --> 00:18:35.894
No. Bianca said that

297
00:18:35.894 --> 00:18:37.994
if it's the place where Takeyama was illegally disposing stuff,

298
00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:39.594
she had an idea of the location.

299
00:18:39.594 --> 00:18:42.994
I thought that it would be a scoop.

300
00:18:42.994 --> 00:18:45.894
Don't tell me that you're the kidnapper!

301
00:19:05.094 --> 00:19:06.594
You can't get away.

302
00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:10.994
Yosaburo, let's get out of here!

303
00:19:10.994 --> 00:19:12.394
Yes, president!

304
00:19:12.394 --> 00:19:13.594
You guys!

305
00:19:13.594 --> 00:19:16.294
Where's Ran?

306
00:19:16.294 --> 00:19:20.294
Tell me! Where's my daughter?

307
00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:21.294
Where is she?

308
00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:23.294
At the bottom of the hole!

309
00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:26.194
Conan! Let's go!

310
00:19:26.194 --> 00:19:35.894
-Ran... -Ran...

311
00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:40.994
Ran!

312
00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.694
Get a hold of yourself!

313
00:19:42.694 --> 00:19:44.994
-Ran. -Ran!

314
00:19:46.794 --> 00:19:48.694
Wake up, Ran!

315
00:19:48.694 --> 00:19:53.194
Ran...

316
00:19:57.394 --> 00:19:58.594
Ran.

317
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.394
Ran.

318
00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:07.594
Conan.

319
00:20:09.194 --> 00:20:11.094
Dad.

320
00:20:11.094 --> 00:20:12.194
Ran.

321
00:20:13.794 --> 00:20:16.894
I made it?

322
00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:20.194
I'm glad.

323
00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:24.794
Ran...

324
00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:27.294
Dad, it hurts.

325
00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:28.394
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:34.194 --> 00:20:37.594
You came wearing platform sneakers after all.

327
00:20:37.594 --> 00:20:38.694
What?

328
00:20:38.694 --> 00:20:42.194
You knew that the live hall would be drenched with water

329
00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:43.494
from the sprinklers

330
00:20:43.494 --> 00:20:45.994
so you were wearing non-slip shoes, right?

331
00:20:47.794 --> 00:20:49.594
You used to wear only platform sneakers

332
00:20:49.594 --> 00:20:53.294
since your days as an underground idol.

333
00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.094
How did you know?

334
00:20:55.094 --> 00:20:57.394
You were jealous, weren't you?

335
00:20:57.394 --> 00:21:01.394
Because Risa, who came in after you became popular.

336
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:02.694
Right.

337
00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.994
If Risa was kidnapped,

338
00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:07.994
I being the MC at the site would also be given attention,

339
00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:10.794
so I thought that I would be able to sell my face and name.

340
00:21:12.094 --> 00:21:14.794
I figured that I could fool Takeyama,

341
00:21:14.794 --> 00:21:18.094
who always came to Risa's live easily.

342
00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:21.794
But, I guess it didn't work out after all.

343
00:22:54.194 --> 00:22:57.894
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

344
00:22:57.894 --> 00:23:01.394
I'm sure glad that Ran's perfectly fine now.

345
00:23:01.394 --> 00:23:02.594
Thank you.

346
00:23:02.594 --> 00:23:08.194
Shinichi seemed worried too and called me at the hospital.

347
00:23:08.194 --> 00:23:09.894
Oh.

348
00:23:09.894 --> 00:23:16.094
More than that, I didn't think that Dad loved me so much.

349
00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:19.294
How many times did we watch that broadcast already?

350
00:23:19.294 --> 00:23:22.894
Well, but your eyes were super bloodshot.

351
00:23:22.894 --> 00:23:25.394
Talk about a great act.

352
00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:26.594
What else did you expect?

353
00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:30.794
I used to want to be an actor in my younger days.

354
00:23:30.794 --> 00:23:32.494
An act?

355
00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:33.794
It was all an act?

356
00:23:33.794 --> 00:23:36.894
Oh, no, of course not!

357
00:23:36.894 --> 00:23:38.894
Brat, what a thing to say.

358
00:23:38.894 --> 00:23:40.394
Hey, Dad.

359
00:23:40.394 --> 00:23:42.594
Tell me the truth.

360
00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:45.794
Oh, I just remembered, I've got a lot of things to do today!

361
00:23:45.794 --> 00:23:46.894
See you!

362
00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:50.194
Wait. Dad!

363
00:23:50.194 --> 00:23:51.894
My tongue slipped.

364
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.194
"Next Episode" -How dare you!

365
00:23:56.194 --> 00:23:58.394
Just how many people did you deceive till now?

366
00:23:58.394 --> 00:24:00.794
I never deceived anyone.

367
00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:03.894
I just introduced good value loans.

368
00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:07.794
Dad, get up!

369
00:24:07.794 --> 00:24:08.994
What is it?

370
00:24:08.994 --> 00:24:12.594
That woman secretary went out alone.

371
00:24:12.594 --> 00:24:13.694
What?

372
00:24:15.494 --> 00:24:16.594
A gunshot?

373
00:24:16.594 --> 00:24:17.994
What?

374
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:24.294
