00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,140
Invited to the Nichiuri TV Building Completion
Commemorative Movie Announcement Event,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,170
we headed out to Osaka.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,290
But during the event,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,500
the brutally murdered body of the
movie's producer was discovered.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,460
Hattori Heiji and I joined the investigation
and identified the culprits,

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,580
but they fled using a car parked
in the basement parking lot.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,550
But in the next moment...

8
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,490
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

9
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,170
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,930
People keep dying at the grand event!

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,770
What will happen to the film's production?

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,480
Always determining the one truth

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,470
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,000
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,641

16
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:48,381

Osaka Police HQ

19
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:53,011
I see.

20
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,241
Hattori Heizo
Osaka Police Chief
I see.

21
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,471
I more or less understand the situation.
Hattori Heizo
Osaka Police Chief

22
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:56,721
I more or less understand the situation.

23
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,971
And no one else was injured in the explosion?

24
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:01,281
Otaki Goro
Osaka Police
Division One Inspector

25
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,421
No.
Otaki Goro
Osaka Police

26
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,561
I guess you could call it the silver
lining, thanks to Inspector Ayanokoji.

Kyoto Police
Division One Inspector
I guess you could call it the silver
lining, thanks to Inspector Ayanokoji.

29
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:09,151
Wasn't it Mori-san's daughter who was
nearly hit while protecting Kazuha?

30
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:12,571
Toyama Ginjiro
Osaka Police Chief Detective
Wasn't it Mori-san's daughter who was
nearly hit while protecting Kazuha?

31
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:13,611
Wasn't it Mori-san's daughter who was
nearly hit while protecting Kazuha?

32
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:18,491
We had her examined at the hospital,
and there was nothing wrong with her.

33
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:22,241
I see. I'm glad she's all right.

34
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,501
Naniwa Police Hospital

35
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:28,951
You didn't need to stay
with me the whole time.

36
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,371
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:33,381
You were nearly hit by a car!

38
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,641
Well, I'm glad nothing happened.

39
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,161
What are the kids doing?

40
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,351
Kazuha-chan's with them.

41
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:45,521
I think I'll head back to the
investigation headquarters.

42
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,061
You can't. We have a film shoot today.

43
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,771
What?

44
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:51,081
Film shoot?

45
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:00,951
Have you determined why
Yonekura-san's car exploded?

46
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:06,401
We believe it was an explosive made
from an acetone peroxide mixture.

47
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,581
It was in the trunk.

48
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,851
You haven't found the detonator?

49
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:18,341
Not yet. But the explosive was unstable.

50
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:21,051
His reckless driving probably bumped it.

51
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,371
And Kouchi died instantly.

52
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:28,441
I'm truly sorry.

53
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:31,041
Apologize later.

54
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,821
More importantly, isn't it
about time you explained

55
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:39,821
what a Kyoto police inspector was
doing at the same crime scene?

56
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:47,111
Two days ago, there was an accident
on a road near Takaragaike in Kyoto.

57
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,831
The male driver of the car died.

58
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:54,591
The deceased was a scriptwriter
named Onda Takashi-san.

59
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,091
Never heard of him.

60
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,011
He was a scriptwriter in name only.

61
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,181
Onda Takashi (43)
Scriptwriter
He was a scriptwriter in name only.

62
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,471
In reality, he was a profligate son who
burned through his parents' wealth.
Onda Takashi (43)
Scriptwriter

63
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,521
In reality, he was a profligate son who
burned through his parents' wealth.

64
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,181
He had a mansion in Iwakura and two cars.

65
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,321
Apparently he had a comfortable life.

66
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:15,361
So what were the circumstances of his death?

67
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:21,711
He and his car were found at the bottom of
a cliff off a mountain road near his home.

68
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:27,451
The local authorities determined that he
failed to make a turn and that it was an accident.

69
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:27,951
Takaragaike Plaza
Kyoto City

70
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:31,431
Was it definitely Onda-san who was driving?
Takaragaike Plaza
Kyoto City

71
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,211
Wasn't the body pretty messed up?
Takaragaike Plaza
Kyoto City

72
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:38,561
Using his fingerprints that escaped
injury and his dental records,

73
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,241
we were able to confirm it was him.

74
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,221
Yeah, but it doesn't look
like that sharp a turn,

75
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,011
Takaragaike Plaza
Kyoto City
Yeah, but it doesn't look
like that sharp a turn,

76
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,131
and wouldn't the road have
been familiar to the victim?
Kyoto City
Takaragaike Plaza

77
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,981
How did he get in an accident?
Kyoto City
Takaragaike Plaza

78
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:53,881
Apparently Onda-san was drunk when he fell.

79
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:56,941
I see. So the accident was
the result of drunk driving.

80
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,991
But you have a different opinion?

81
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:01,111
Yes.

82
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:05,971
He may have been drunk, but there
were hardly any skid marks.

83
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:09,001
It's hard to believe this
was just an accident.

84
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:12,861
You think someone messed with his brakes?

85
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,251
It's possible.

86
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:18,501
But didn't Onda-san have two cars?

87
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:23,251
That's right. He had a red
and a blue sports car.

88
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:26,891
Apparently he drove the red one on even
dates and the blue one on odd ones.

89
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:28,221
What about the day of the accident?

90
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:30,101
He drove the red one.

91
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:34,151
What? But it was an odd date two days ago.

92
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:38,101
The blue car was having mechanical trouble.

93
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:41,531
That's why he drove the red car two days ago.

94
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:45,921
Naturally, the blue car really
did have mechanical issues.

95
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,951
But we didn't find any signs
of tampering with the brakes.

96
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:56,691
If someone tampered with his car, why
did they only tamper with the red car?

97
00:06:56,691 --> 00:07:01,021
If they wanted to kill him as soon as
possible, wouldn't they have done it to both?

98
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,091
You're right.

99
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:07,311
We get that you have doubts
about the Takaragaike case.

100
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:12,351
But what's that got to do with you
coming all the way out to Osaka?

101
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:16,281
The truth is, while investigating Onda-san,

102
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,611
I learned he associated with
Yonekura-san in the past.

103
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:24,321
I came to ask Yonekura-san about it,

104
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,491
but I arrived after Nichiuri
TV had been locked down.

105
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,621
I could've approached directly,

106
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:35,121
but I didn't want to make unnecessary
waves, so I restrained myself.

107
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,931
So you were quietly watching us work?

108
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,381
That's not very nice of you.

109
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,501
Forgive me.

110
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:47,271
I haven't found anything concrete yet.

111
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,141
Hey.

112
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:52,141
How were Onda-san and Yonekura-san connected?

113
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,391
Right.

114
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:58,061
Onda-san and Yonekura-san were
once part of the same group

115
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,071
sponsored independent
film screening society.

116
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:03,401
Did you know about this?

117
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:04,651
N-No.

118
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,061
Inspector Ayanokoji.

119
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:12,291
I didn't find Yonekura-san's
name in Onda-san's phone either.

120
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,661
Then why?

121
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:18,921
Yonekura-san was seen near Onda-san's home.

122
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,141
And while investigating that, you
discovered their past connection.

123
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,671
Things are getting complicated.

124
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:33,031
Onda-san's case aside, we can't
ignore the bomb that was in the car.

125
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:39,001
Maybe someone other than those two
was trying to kill Yonekura-san.

126
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:42,821
There's something I've been wondering.

127
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,821
What is it, kid?

128
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:50,461
Remember the small scratch on the top
shelf at Yonekura-san's murder scene?

129
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,571
Yeah.

130
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:56,621
Mihara probably accidentally dropped
the knife while cutting the rope.

131
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,701
Then it must've made a noise, right?

132
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:04,211
Why didn't Yonekura-san notice that?

133
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:06,241
Why?

134
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,721
If he noticed the person
on top of the scaffold,

135
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:13,471
he could've dodged the falling kaiju.

136
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:16,851
Otaki, go confirm that immediately.

137
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,121
Yes, sir!

138
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:26,041
What? The knife?

139
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:26,961
Mihara Yoshito (38)
Nichiuri TV Movie Production
Department Producer

140
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:29,031
Yeah, I dropped it.
Mihara Yoshito (38)
Nichiuri TV Movie Production
Department Producer

141
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,831
It made a surprisingly loud sound.

142
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:35,981
I thought he'd notice, and that I was screwed.

143
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:39,611
Yonekura-san didn't notice?

144
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:40,851
Nope.

145
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:45,041
I don't know why, but he was
glued to his phone screen.

146
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:52,801
He kept saying "damn that
Onda" in a real tense voice.

147
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,361
Is that true? Did he really say Onda?

148
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,881
Yeah.

149
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:07,941
Tell me. Is Kouchi really dead?

150
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,371
Yeah.

151
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:10,901
I can't believe it.

152
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:16,031
Was it really a coincidence that you
tried to steal Yonekura-san's car?

153
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:22,961
Of course! Besides, Kouchi said he knew
where the spare key to his car was hidden.

154
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,881
I see.

155
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,941
I heard the car was rigged with a bomb.

156
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:32,131
Was someone else trying to kill Yonekura?

157
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,721
That's currently under investigation.

158
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:35,711
Seriously?

159
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:40,101
Then what was the point of what we did?

160
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:46,551
Yonekura-san was probably
looking at an online news site.

161
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:52,111
Everyone was covering the car
that went up in flames in Kyoto.

162
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,811
But it could be a coincidence.

163
00:10:55,811 --> 00:11:00,121
Maybe he was just shocked to see an article
about the death of an old acquaintance.

164
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:04,951
Inspector Otaki, where were
Yonekura-san's belongings?

165
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:09,631
They were left in the staff
room on the sixth floor.

166
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,161
Could we look at those now?

167
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:15,151
I've got a list of the items.

168
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:19,641
His plane ticket to Bangkok,
his passport, and...

169
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,141
What is it?

He had six newspapers,
including sports papers.

171
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,901
They're all from the day of the incident.

172
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,601
Smells fishy.

173
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:34,771
It's possible he wanted to know more about
Onda's case and bought everything he could find.

174
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:37,911
Sounds like we'll have to
re-investigate our case.

175
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,831
We'd appreciate your help.

176
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,411
Understood.

177
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:47,821
I'll ask my forensics team
to reexamine Onda-san's car.

178
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,131
Thank you.

179
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,051
Hello?

180
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,171
Heiji, what are you doing?
Conan-kun, what are you doing?

181
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:57,641
The film shoot has started!

182
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,971
Crap! I forgot!

183
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,111
Osaka Castle Park

184
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,391
Okay, everyone!
Osaka Castle Park

185
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,021
We'll now begin the rehearsal.

186
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:09,401
Please imagine a kaiju's head
at the end of that pole.

187
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,381
What face should I make when I run?

188
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:15,541
Don't ask me.

189
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,831
I don't think you need to
think about it that hard.

190
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:22,911
You're right. After all, no one's
actually been chased by a kaiju before.

191
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,411
You'll be running that way.

192
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,361
How you want to act while
fleeing is up to you.

193
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:34,951
But please don't smile or behave
strangely in an attempt to stand out.

194
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:37,431
Good grief. This is a lot of work.

195
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,551
Let's start with the rehearsal.

196
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,561
Suemura Ryohei (51)
Daiho Films Employee

197
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,631
Gomera

198
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,001
It's a kaiju!

199
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:11,751
Help!

200
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,501
Ayumi-chan! This way!

201
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,801
I-It's a kaiju! Heiji, I'm scared!

202
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,641
I-It's okay! Come with me!

203
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:26,521
I can't believe he's this bad at acting...

204
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:27,731
Conan-kun!

205
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:33,461
Wait a minute. Isn't this...?

206
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,751
How was my fleeing?

207
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,851
It was a brilliant performance.

208
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,501
What about me?

209
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,611
You guys did great.

210
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,291
Do exactly that when we film.

211
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,411
All right!

212
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:51,391
You were good, but your
movements were a little stiff.

213
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,001
Try to relax a little more.

214
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:59,171
You were great, too, especially
how you carried the child.

215
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:01,431
Oh, and I'm sorry.

216
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:02,111
Huh?

217
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:05,061
Could you try a little harder?

218
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,311
Sure...

219
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,521
Gomera

220
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,731
Okay, we're ready to film.

221
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,601
Hei-chan, we've got another case.

222
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,898
This is crazy.

223
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,148
I can't believe there was only one
victim in an explosion this large.

224
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:57,748
The company that owned this warehouse
went bankrupt a year ago.

225
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:01,408
They haven't found a buyer since
then, so it's been abandoned.

226
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:05,218
So who got caught in the explosion?

227
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:10,668
Suemura Ryohei-san of the Daiho
film production department.

228
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:13,418
What? Daiho Films?

229
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:18,968
Suemura-san was looking for a warehouse to
use in the filming of "Gomera VS Yaiba."

230
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:22,678
He came to take pictures to study the place.

231
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,598
Have you determined what the explosive was?

232
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:27,768
We're not certain yet,

233
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:32,688
but according to forensics, they
most likely used acetone peroxide.

234
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:36,748
In other words, just like the
bomb that blew up Kouchi.

235
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:38,698
We believe it was the same substance.

236
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,368
I see.

237
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:43,938
So the two bombings are connected.

238
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,608
Which means...

239
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:52,168
My, my. How could you exclude me?

240
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,298
You caught me.

241
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:57,718
Did the Kyoto police figure anything out?

242
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:58,738
Yes.

243
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:02,358
The results of our re-investigation
have increased the probability

244
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:06,058
that Onda-san's death
was a murder by bombing.

245
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:11,758
In other words, a bomb was rigged in
his car, just like Yonekura-san's.

246
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:16,188
Which means these are three
serial bombing cases.

247
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:21,198
Then the Osaka and Kyoto Police will have

248
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:22,968
to form a joint investigation headquarters.

249
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,378
We'd be happy to have the help.

250
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:30,758
I see.

251
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:35,118
Then Dad won't be back for a while.

252
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:41,468
He'll probably be stationed at the
joint investigation headquarters.

253
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,718
Anyway...

254
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:43,968
Kamen Yaiba Café

255
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:46,468
Kamen Yaiba

256
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:51,148
What are we doing here?

257
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:54,108
Kazuha-chan insisted on coming.

258
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,978
Good grief. But...

259
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:59,828
I guess it's fine since
that's so interesting.

260
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:03,728
Heiji, what are you doing? Come over here.

261
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:05,658
What? You want me to stand with you?

262
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,698
Of course!

263
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:10,138
It's Kamen Yaiba!

264
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,418
Yeah? So, what?

265
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:15,568
Strike a pose. I'm taking the picture.

266
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,958
Does Kazuha-neechan seem different to you?

267
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,758
It's love.

268
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:26,988
He's so cool! So cool!

269
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:27,828
Hey, you're freaking out Yaiba-san.
He's so cool! So cool!

270
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:29,928
Hey, you're freaking out Yaiba-san.

271
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:32,568
Ran-chan, take some with me.

272
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,508
I'll be back.

273
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:40,098
Haibara, there's something
I want you to look into.

274
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:46,828
Lately I feel like I've been demoted
from your partner to your errand girl.

275
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:47,758
Okuda Mansion

276
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:50,948
Okuda-san, we heard you once sponsored
an independent film screening society.
Okuda Mansion

277
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,828
Okuda-san, we heard you once sponsored
an independent film screening society.

278
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:55,208
Yeah, I did.

279
00:17:55,208 --> 00:18:00,898
It went well for a while, but things have
been terrible for the last few years.

280
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,558
I quit about three years ago.

281
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:06,298
Do you recognize these three men?

282
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:10,998
I remember them well.

283
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:14,078
They were involved about twenty years ago.

284
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,588
They called themselves Team Yonekura.

285
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,808
They had interesting ideas.

286
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:22,648
Yonekura was the idea man and
came up with all kinds of plans.

287
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:28,198
Onda was the aspiring scriptwriter,
and Suemura was the aspiring director.

288
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:34,338
Could you tell us more about that?

289
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:37,498
Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation HQ

290
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:46,638
According to Okuda-san, there was another man
who worked with Yonekura-san and the others.

291
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:46,918
Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation

292
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,388
Ishizawa Katsuji-san,
an engineering graduate.
Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation
Key Witness
Born in Kyoto
Engineering School Graduate
Bachelor's Degree Acquired
Member of Team Yonekura
Ishizawa Katsuji (38)

293
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:56,138
Engineering. In other words, he has the
scientific knowledge to build a bomb.

294
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:01,728
Apparently he was dexterous and came up with
all kinds of ideas for props to use in movies.

295
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:03,398
Where is he now?

296
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,458
His whereabouts are unknown.

297
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:09,168
He changes jobs and residences all the time.

298
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,158
Excuse me. Hello?

299
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:19,498
But isn't it a bit much to treat him as a
suspect just for being an engineering graduate?

300
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:24,798
According to Okuda-san, Ishizawa-san
was bullied by the other three.

301
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:30,228
They threatened him into building
props and performing odd jobs.

302
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:33,928
Ultimately, he gave up on finding
a job in the movie industry.

303
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:36,808
I see. That would be a motive.

304
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,678
We've found Ishizawa.

305
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,818
He's got an uncle in Sakai,
and he ended up at his house.

306
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,038
What about his uncle?

307
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,818
He died last year.

308
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,528
So he's living alone.

309
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:53,158
According to the neighbors,
he doesn't have a steady job.

310
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,578
Inspector!

311
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:56,298
What's all the fuss?

312
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:57,538
We found fingerprints.

313
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:01,628
We found Ishizawa's fingerprints on
the bomb at Suemura's murder scene.

314
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:02,418
What?

315
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,598
Shall we head there immediately?

316
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:07,898
We should be cautious.

317
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:10,208
There may still be bombs in his house.

318
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:15,168
If too many of us go, he might
find out and cause a commotion.

319
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:17,428
We'll have to go as a small group.

320
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:20,438
The question is, who will lead it?

321
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,678
I'll let you handle that.

322
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:32,198
We'd better get back the
investigation headquarters.

323
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:34,078
Y-Yeah...

324
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:37,698
Ran-chan, look at this.

325
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:38,998
Where'd you get that?

326
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:42,048
Heiji bought it for me.

327
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:44,928
How nice.

328
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:49,378
I know, right? Isn't it nice?

329
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,128
Do I look good? Does it look good on me?

330
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,508
It looks great.
Do I look good? Does it look good on me?

331
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,018
Good for you.

332
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:56,008
Y-Yeah...

333
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:06,018
We watched him all night, and
we didn't see any movement.

334
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,758
Is he really in there?

335
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:13,778
The outdoor AC unit is working, and
the directional mics picked up sounds.

336
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:13,988
Ishizawa

337
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,788
There's definitely someone there.
Ishizawa

338
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:21,988
Ishizawa-san.
