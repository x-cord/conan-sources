1
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.487
Snow!

2
00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:19.041
So much snow.

3
00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:22.454
Hey. Be careful!

4
00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:25.574
Welcome to Villa Ice Room.

5
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.075
Hello, we're glad to be here.

6
00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:31.354
Hello.

7
00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.054
Hey, you guys. Come over and say hello!

8
00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:36.387
Hello!

9
00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:39.108
-Let's make snowballs. -Okay.

10
00:00:42.207 --> 00:00:43.708
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:45.220
It's okay.

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.107
We used to like playing in the snow when we were small, too.

13
00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:54.008
That's right, children should play energetically outside, healthy is best!

14
00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:56.521
I think they're too energetic.

15
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.142
There are some who lack energy, too.

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.741
Snowball fighting. Looks like fun.

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.421
-Bullseye! -You hit him!

18
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:13.741
Now you've done it, Genta!

19
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.541
You're still green.

20
00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:20.853
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

21
00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:22.853
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

22
00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:26.621
The clue disappears in the snow. What is the trick that was left behind?

23
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:28.154
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:30.120
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.574
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:19.028
"Lover Vanishes in the Blizzard"

27
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:35.828
There!

28
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:40.174
Aren't you snowball fighting, Ai?

29
00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:43.995
I pass. I'm not at home snowball fighting.

30
00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:47.095
Oh? Then, what's that?

31
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.762
I'm not playing. It's artistry.

32
00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:55.527
Artistry...

33
00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:58.177
Got him, got him!

34
00:03:58.297 --> 00:04:00.131
You did it, Ayumi.

35
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.741
Gosh.

36
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:03.741
Where's Genta?

37
00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:05.841
I don't see him.

38
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:07.795
Genta...

39
00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:10.994
There!

40
00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:19.193
He went to the restroom to wipe is face.

41
00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.627
You're a devil.

42
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.407
Genta's sure taking long.

43
00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:26.660
I wonder if he's okay?

44
00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:30.260
Okay, I'll go check.

45
00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:39.761
Genta!

46
00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:43.795
Don't be ridiculous!

47
00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:48.841
Juri, I'm against it.

48
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:50.829
Split up with this guy!

49
00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:53.328
Please stop it, Aya.

50
00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.727
You have no right to say that to me.

51
00:04:58.127 --> 00:05:00.661
-Why you! -Shut up!

52
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:06.762
Wait, Masahiko!

53
00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:13.073
Juri. Are you all right?

54
00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:16.027
You're awful, Aya.

55
00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:26.978
I'm sorry you had to see that.

56
00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.528
Who was that?

57
00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:33.928
Masahiko Fujita, Juri's boyfriend.

58
00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:38.307
He's a notorious local.

59
00:05:38.427 --> 00:05:42.994
Ryoko and I are both against them going with each other. But, Juri...

60
00:05:46.327 --> 00:05:49.295
-Genta! -Conan!

61
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:52.295
You still have snow on your face.

62
00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:54.061
Oh, no.

63
00:05:54.527 --> 00:05:56.474
Besides, the bathroom is here.

64
00:05:56.594 --> 00:05:58.428
I see.

65
00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:02.560
What's with him?

66
00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:13.828
What're you doing?

67
00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:17.073
Nothing.

68
00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:19.027
Children shouldn't come in here.

69
00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:22.195
It's dangerous because there are things like knives here.

70
00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:24.161
Okay.

71
00:06:27.627 --> 00:06:29.961
You're something, Ai!

72
00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:33.007
How nicely made.

73
00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:35.441
It's bold but delicate.

74
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.661
It's indeed artistic!

75
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:39.961
Well, I guess it's pretty well done!

76
00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:43.161
You seem to be enjoying yourself, too.

77
00:06:44.794 --> 00:06:48.361
Let's go back. I'm getting hungry.

78
00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:53.861
Hey!

79
00:06:54.627 --> 00:06:55.874
Aya!

80
00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:59.541
-Did you enjoy playing in the snow? -Yep, it was fun.

81
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.661
-It was fantastic. -You should've come play, too.

82
00:07:03.928 --> 00:07:06.695
We adults got other things to do!

83
00:07:09.394 --> 00:07:12.394
Thank you all so much for waiting.

84
00:07:14.994 --> 00:07:17.528
You made all this?

85
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:21.362
Ryoko's a super cook!

86
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:25.040
-The two younger ones are no good at all though! -How dare you!

87
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.360
Well, well... Let's eat.

88
00:07:29.494 --> 00:07:31.073
Let's eat.

89
00:07:31.193 --> 00:07:33.860
Dig in.

90
00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:39.794
Aren't you eating, Ayumi?

91
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:43.507
It smells like garlic.

92
00:07:43.627 --> 00:07:46.727
I don't want to get stink because I have to spend the night here.

93
00:07:48.227 --> 00:07:49.407
You're right.

94
00:07:49.527 --> 00:07:51.174
But it's strange.

95
00:07:51.294 --> 00:07:54.327
There doesn't seem to be any dishes here that have garlic in it.

96
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.262
-Wow, am I filled. -It was good.

97
00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:05.895
-It was really delicious! -Thank you.

98
00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:07.295
That's right!

99
00:08:07.427 --> 00:08:09.940
Juri, it's time for your medicine. Did you drink it?

100
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.727
Oh, no. Thank you, Aya.

101
00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.407
Don't forget, Juri.

102
00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:19.407
It's okay that she's easygoing, but she's still such a baby.

103
00:08:19.527 --> 00:08:23.007
No! What shall I do? I can't find my medicine.

104
00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:26.961
-What's up? -I can't find it. My medicine...

105
00:08:27.794 --> 00:08:29.561
Did you look good?

106
00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:31.250
Yep.

107
00:08:31.494 --> 00:08:34.095
Do you really need that medicine?

108
00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:38.140
I think it's okay to miss drinking it,

109
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.061
but she's never missed drinking it before.

110
00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:43.841
I tell you, just what do you think you're doing?

111
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:47.328
Okay. I'll go get some at the town hospital.

112
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.741
I'm sure they'll give a prescription there.

113
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:52.240
But I can't make you do that.

114
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.228
I'm sorry, but can you do that?

115
00:08:55.527 --> 00:08:57.107
Ryoko.

116
00:08:57.227 --> 00:09:00.527
Give me a chance to look good sometimes, will you?

117
00:09:00.761 --> 00:09:02.495
Masahiko.

118
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:05.028
Okay. Please, then.

119
00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:10.929
Okay. I'll be right back.

120
00:09:11.527 --> 00:09:13.961
-Be careful. -I will.

121
00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:30.995
-It's snowing pretty heavily. -Yes.

122
00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:36.462
Yes, Villa Ice Room.

123
00:09:37.028 --> 00:09:39.562
Yes, that's right.

124
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:43.195
Huh? Masahiko isn't there yet?

125
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:46.728
No joke? He should've been there long ago.

126
00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:49.161
I'll try call him.

127
00:09:51.193 --> 00:09:52.860
Okay.

128
00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:55.637
Well?

129
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.908
No good. I can't get through.

130
00:09:58.028 --> 00:10:00.462
Don't tell me something happened?

131
00:10:00.627 --> 00:10:03.961
Even to go out in search of him, it won't be easy in this snow.

132
00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:15.394
Masahiko's car is here.

133
00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:17.340
Did he walk there?

134
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.808
Well, the forecast said it would snow.

135
00:10:19.928 --> 00:10:23.328
Maybe he thought it'd be dangerous to take the car.

136
00:10:24.394 --> 00:10:26.295
Masahiko!

137
00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.027
Masahiko!

138
00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:36.194
Don't tell me...

139
00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:40.327
That's...

140
00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:01.504
I see. Okay.

141
00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:05.469
It seems the police can't get here for a while because of the snow.

142
00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:08.935
-They said to preserve the scene as is. -Okay.

143
00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.202
I wonder if he slipped or something.

144
00:11:13.536 --> 00:11:16.669
I guess so. The soil is scraped.

145
00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:19.570
He probably fell from there.

146
00:11:31.402 --> 00:11:34.736
Well, it was probably an accident.

147
00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:37.869
The place where Masahiko fell from...

148
00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:39.869
Is anything wrong?

149
00:11:40.236 --> 00:11:43.269
Isn't the snow accumulated a little odd just over there?

150
00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:45.235
It looks like it's high on the side of the mountain

151
00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:47.935
and lower on the side of the cliff.

152
00:11:48.402 --> 00:11:50.270
True.

153
00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:52.583
Nothing's odd about it at all.

154
00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:56.803
More snow accumulates on the side where there's not much sunshine.

155
00:11:57.035 --> 00:11:59.302
That's true, but...

156
00:12:01.835 --> 00:12:03.703
Hey, look out!

157
00:12:06.703 --> 00:12:10.103
-See, I told you so! -Are you okay?

158
00:12:11.436 --> 00:12:13.436
Yeah, I'm fine.

159
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:17.902
This is...

160
00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:20.603
What's wrong?

161
00:12:27.302 --> 00:12:29.302
Isn't it strange after all?

162
00:12:30.302 --> 00:12:36.236
I wonder why Masahiko risked the danger of taking the rugged side road.

163
00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:39.903
That's obvious because it's a shortcut.

164
00:12:40.102 --> 00:12:42.269
-Really? -Yes.

165
00:12:42.436 --> 00:12:46.770
Cars can't pass there, but it's closer to town if you take that road.

166
00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:50.336
We rarely use it because it's dangerous, though.

167
00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:53.303
Which means you went to town at sundown, too?

168
00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:56.770
Hey!

169
00:12:57.002 --> 00:13:00.236
Oh, yeah. I had some things to do.

170
00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:12.136
It's my fault. All because I lost my medicine, Masahiko...

171
00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:15.915
It's nobody's fault.

172
00:13:16.035 --> 00:13:18.369
This was just destined to be.

173
00:13:18.835 --> 00:13:21.449
He was really unlucky, that man...

174
00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:24.702
He shouldn't have taken the shortcut.

175
00:13:41.302 --> 00:13:42.803
Is anybody there?

176
00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:59.403
"Monaka Ice"

177
00:13:59.703 --> 00:14:01.137
This is...

178
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:12.849
Are you all right?

179
00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:18.216
Yes, thank you. I just had trouble breathing.

180
00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:21.003
Should I go call your sisters?

181
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:23.849
I don't want to cause them too much worry

182
00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:28.736
because they take care of me as if I were their daughter.

183
00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.935
So much so that they'd do anything for you?

184
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:36.269
-Huh? -No, it's nothing.

185
00:14:39.102 --> 00:14:40.469
There we go.

186
00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:43.049
-This is heavy. -Put it down there.

187
00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:45.269
What are you guys doing?

188
00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:49.715
I told them they didn't have to, but...

189
00:14:49.835 --> 00:14:51.902
We're going to protect them.

190
00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:55.204
We don't want them to melt.

191
00:14:55.402 --> 00:14:58.382
That's why they put them into the cooler box.

192
00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.502
How kind of them.

193
00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.769
I see! So that's the story.

194
00:15:05.002 --> 00:15:06.703
What's up?

195
00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:14.636
What did you want to talk to us about?

196
00:15:16.569 --> 00:15:21.869
Well, I figured out the truth to this case.

197
00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:25.502
Case? Wasn't that an accident?

198
00:15:25.735 --> 00:15:29.149
No, Masahiko didn't die of an accident.

199
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:33.716
The perp set a trap at the side road and made him fall to his death.

200
00:15:33.836 --> 00:15:35.882
It was premeditated murder!

201
00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.035
-What? -What?

202
00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:41.870
Wait a sec. There was no trap at the site, was there?

203
00:15:42.236 --> 00:15:46.770
Besides, after Masahiko left, we all stayed together.

204
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:50.736
Nobody could've gotten rid of the trap!

205
00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:53.382
-It wasn't gotten rid of. -What?

206
00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:57.036
So the trap must still be at the site.

207
00:15:57.302 --> 00:16:00.270
Only it can't be seen by you, though.

208
00:16:00.469 --> 00:16:04.469
Yes, the perp used snow and ice.

209
00:16:06.868 --> 00:16:08.816
First of all, the perp pushed the snow side road

210
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.316
towards the side of the mountain.

211
00:16:11.436 --> 00:16:14.216
By doing this, it would make Masahiko avoid the mountain side

212
00:16:14.336 --> 00:16:16.516
and go to the side of the cliff.

213
00:16:16.636 --> 00:16:19.682
After restricting his path,

214
00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:25.069
the perp placed a plate of ice that was made beforehand in the freezer.

215
00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:27.849
I see.

216
00:16:27.969 --> 00:16:30.669
Ice is easily hidden in the snow, and will eventually melt.

217
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:33.169
Nothing has to be gotten rid of since nothing will be left behind.

218
00:16:33.302 --> 00:16:35.282
Wait! But if so...

219
00:16:35.402 --> 00:16:38.069
Yeah, there will be no physical evidence.

220
00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:42.269
But the perp made a mistake.

221
00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:46.876
This is what I found at the place Masahiko fell to his death.

222
00:16:48.969 --> 00:16:52.937
-What's that? -And this.

223
00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:58.483
That's the package of an ice cream sweets that went on sale just yesterday.

224
00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:01.670
Right, and this is a piece of it.

225
00:17:02.102 --> 00:17:05.082
It's the stuff that Genta took out of the freezer here and secretly ate.

226
00:17:05.202 --> 00:17:07.636
How did you know?

227
00:17:07.835 --> 00:17:11.069
I thought it was strange back then.

228
00:17:11.603 --> 00:17:15.404
-Conan! -You still have snow on your face.

229
00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:22.235
-Aren't you eating, Ayumi? -It smells like garlic.

230
00:17:23.202 --> 00:17:26.615
Although there were no dishes with garlic, it smelled of garlic

231
00:17:26.735 --> 00:17:29.169
because Genta was the source of it.

232
00:17:29.536 --> 00:17:32.437
That's because I was hungry.

233
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:35.583
When Genta secret ate the ice cream,

234
00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:38.715
the perp was freezing the water

235
00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:41.835
in order to make the plate of ice.

236
00:17:42.302 --> 00:17:48.302
The flakes of what Genta ate fell on it, and froze.

237
00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:54.170
The perp, without realizing this, used it as is.

238
00:17:54.469 --> 00:17:56.970
There's no other reason that the flakes of this ice cream

239
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:59.070
would be at the scene of the crime!

240
00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:06.237
Right, the perp is none other than one of you who live here.

241
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:10.536
Yes, I got it! The perp is Aya!

242
00:18:11.169 --> 00:18:16.436
It's true that we witnessed Aya who came back from the side road.

243
00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:17.903
Hey!

244
00:18:18.336 --> 00:18:22.570
Not holding anything and off her guard.

245
00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:28.349
In order to set the trap, a cooler box to carry the plate of ice

246
00:18:28.469 --> 00:18:31.483
and a shovel to move the snow are necessary.

247
00:18:31.603 --> 00:18:33.337
It's impossible to go empty handed.

248
00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:37.815
First of all, the perp would never call out to us.

249
00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:41.335
Aya is not the perp. She's an eye-witness.

250
00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:47.015
Aya probably just saw the real perp

251
00:18:47.135 --> 00:18:49.316
come out of the side road.

252
00:18:49.436 --> 00:18:52.316
Although she got worried and went to take a look at the side road,

253
00:18:52.436 --> 00:18:56.203
she probably didn't notice the trap that the perp had set.

254
00:18:56.402 --> 00:18:58.715
If she'd noticed it, she would've stopped the perp.

255
00:18:58.835 --> 00:19:01.082
Wrong! I didn't see anything!

256
00:19:01.202 --> 00:19:03.249
It's okay already, Aya.

257
00:19:03.369 --> 00:19:06.049
That's right, I did it.

258
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:08.949
I'm like a parent to Juri, you see.

259
00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:12.636
I've got to get rid of all the bad guys that hang around you.

260
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.403
Ryoko...

261
00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:19.803
Please understand, Juri. It's for your sake.

262
00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:23.149
This crime cannot be committed

263
00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:26.269
unless the ice plate is taken out of the freezer.

264
00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:31.982
Back then, the person who was in the kitchen at this time

265
00:19:32.102 --> 00:19:34.436
should've been Ryoko... to make dinner.

266
00:19:35.102 --> 00:19:37.836
She is the only one who could've committed the crime.

267
00:19:39.969 --> 00:19:42.615
That's what I'd like to say but, Ryoko...

268
00:19:42.735 --> 00:19:45.715
unfortunately, you're not the perp either.

269
00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:46.868
Why not?

270
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:50.715
You love Juri as if she were your daughter.

271
00:19:50.835 --> 00:19:55.605
You would never kill anyone in a way that would make Juri suffer for life.

272
00:19:57.002 --> 00:20:02.669
You're just protecting her. The real perp, Juri!

273
00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:06.516
-What? -I told you I'm the one who did it!

274
00:20:06.636 --> 00:20:10.803
Yes, that ice cream wrapper... I hid that, too.

275
00:20:11.102 --> 00:20:14.269
-All to protect Juri, correct? -No!

276
00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:18.049
Hey, Aya. You saw me at the side road at sundown, didn't you?

277
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:19.682
Hey, isn't that right?

278
00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:20.935
Stop it!

279
00:20:22.302 --> 00:20:25.648
Stop it already! Stop protecting me anymore.

280
00:20:25.768 --> 00:20:28.369
You're right, I killed him!

281
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:35.702
That's the missing medicine, right?

282
00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:39.269
You had it with you after all.

283
00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:41.748
She lied.

284
00:20:41.868 --> 00:20:46.416
But, back then, Masahiko volunteered to go get the medicine himself.

285
00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:51.037
Besides, who knew that he was going to take the side road?

286
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:53.969
That's easy.

287
00:20:54.202 --> 00:20:56.516
You're too persistent.

288
00:20:56.636 --> 00:20:59.604
What do I have to do to get you to break up with me?

289
00:20:59.735 --> 00:21:00.902
Okay.

290
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.416
I don't care if it's just an act.

291
00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:06.516
Try saving me one last time.

292
00:21:06.636 --> 00:21:09.736
Then, I'll set you free with no strings attached.

293
00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:15.035
That's when you instructed him to take the side road, correct?

294
00:21:15.202 --> 00:21:18.549
Yes. I told him it was a shortcut.

295
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:21.003
What about that wink back then?

296
00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:25.036
Let me look good sometimes!

297
00:21:25.802 --> 00:21:28.382
It was a signal of confirmation.

298
00:21:28.502 --> 00:21:31.502
"This is it, right?"

299
00:21:33.436 --> 00:21:35.037
He's to blame!

300
00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:38.469
Let's break up.

301
00:21:38.835 --> 00:21:41.069
I've got another girl.

302
00:21:43.768 --> 00:21:47.768
You're depressing, slow and boring.

303
00:21:48.135 --> 00:21:51.135
They raised you wrong, maybe?

304
00:21:51.969 --> 00:21:56.069
I... I couldn't forgive him.

305
00:21:56.935 --> 00:21:58.903
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:26.969 --> 00:23:31.636
Stink! It stinks of garlic!

307
00:23:32.002 --> 00:23:35.182
-It's pretty good. -See?

308
00:23:35.302 --> 00:23:40.136
-What shall I do? It's good. -Here, this is for you.

309
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:44.748
That's... Why's the real stuff here?

310
00:23:44.868 --> 00:23:47.915
-And where's my ice cream? -We ate it!

311
00:23:48.035 --> 00:23:49.435
What?

312
00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:54.102
"Next Episode" -Ai was nowhere.

313
00:23:54.369 --> 00:23:56.949
She should've been finished long ago if she went shopping.

314
00:23:57.069 --> 00:23:59.069
I wonder what happened to her.

315
00:23:59.835 --> 00:24:01.835
If anything were to have happened...

316
00:24:10.002 --> 00:24:13.002
It belongs to the kitten that was fond of Ai.

317
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:20.516
Next Conan, "Confinement of Ai Haibara"

318
00:24:35.935 --> 00:24:37.915
Next Conan's Hint:

319
00:24:38.035 --> 00:24:40.168
"Canned juice"

320
00:24:40.703 --> 00:24:42.982
You can't judge a man's worth with chocolate!

321
00:24:43.102 --> 00:24:45.636
-Did you want it just a little, though? -Yes!
