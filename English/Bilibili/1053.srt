1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,405
Yes. I'm sorry,

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,508
but I have no idea where I am right now.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,809
I was chasing after a man

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,312
who was suspected of
stealing a large amount of explosives,

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,115
but I was taken by surprise
and when I woke up...

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,716
Are you able to use the GPS?

7
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,620
It seems that he has taken my smartphone.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,123
I had to borrow a flip phone
belonging to a body

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,825
that was left in the basement
so that I could call you.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,127
A body?

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,120
Yes.

12
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,631
But its battery is running out.

13
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,501
Was the deceased killed by the target?

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,960
It's likely.

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,104
But it's all right.

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,507
I could escape from
this basement by myself...

17
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,450
No, Kazami.

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
If you make a mistake while moving around
and calling for backup,

19
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,413
the culprit will make a move

20
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,615
and we may not be able to
avoid the worst-case scenario.

21
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,500
I'll go there.

22
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,522
Before you end up dead, that is.

23
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,224
Mysterious clouds obstruct the field of vision.

24
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,126
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

25
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,228
Suspicious people are gathering at a farm.

26
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,330
Things take a sudden turn
when Amuro makes his move.

27
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,932
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,901
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,303
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,011
"The Live Coals on the Farm (Part 1)"

31
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,815
I can't wait to see the new chickens!

32
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,919
I hope they're happy and healthy.

33
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,722
Right? The last two that died were always sick,

34
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,025
and we didn't get to take care of them much.

35
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,128
They were just old rather than sick.

36
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,529
They were the ones I took care of

37
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,931
when I was in my first year of
elementary school.

38
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,199
You say that, Conan...

39
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,402
But aren't you still a first-year
in elementary school?

40
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,003
I mean...

41
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,150
Are you stupid or something?

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,650
Everyone, listen up.

43
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,512
Don't forget to learn how to
take proper care of the chickens

44
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,115
we're getting from the people at the farm.

45
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,817
Yes, Ms. Kobayashi!

46
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,120
Is it really going to be all right?

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,524
Why are you bringing the kids along?

48
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,125
If you wanted them to learn
how to raise chickens,

49
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,328
I think we could teach them ourselves.

50
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,029
Ms. Wakasa...

51
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,632
I wanted to carry this information
with me to the grave.

52
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,500
It's a secret.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,802
Sorry?

54
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,404
I'm terrible at handling chickens!

55
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,607
Is that so?

56
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,008
Ever since I was a kid

57
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,713
and I saw a flock of
vultures devouring a dead zebra on television,

58
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:12,060
I've been so scared of those bulging eyes
and pointed beaks.

59
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,220
That's why even if I can't do it myself,

60
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,123
I thought I could explain it more easily

61
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,125
if I could record videos of the children
taking care of the chickens.

62
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,630
But the officer you're dating...

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,332
Isn't his name Shiratori?

64
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,401
It's just a name, isn't it?

65
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:33,106
Would you think of someone named Karasudaas
a crow?

66
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,908
No, I wouldn't.

67
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,111
But crows have the image of
being dark and cunning.

68
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,714
They also move in groups
and are always up to something.

69
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:46,819
They're not that approachable, either.

70
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,122
Then again, people like that

71
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,125
might even be cheerful and fun to be with.

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,727
That's totally possible!

73
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,650
Crows.

74
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,800
Renya Karasuma.

75
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,900
The head of the organisation

76
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,802
that produced the medicine
that shrunk my body.

77
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,806
And Ms. Wakasa is a candidate for Rum,

78
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,700
the number two of the organisation.

79
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,009
Speaking of which,

80
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,414
the owner of the farm
we're headed to is called Hatoyama.

81
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,216
I hope he's peaceful like a dove.

82
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,950
Are you also going to Hatoyama Farm?

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,022
( Junya Hitsuka (34) )
What a coincidence.

84
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,160
( Junya Hitsuka (34) )
I'm heading to that area myself.

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,310
I'm heading to that area myself.

86
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,529
Why are you going there?

87
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,531
I have some interviews to do there.

88
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,533
Well, it's like a tour of spiritual hot spots

89
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,502
where the same people often gather.

90
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,404
Judging by the way you look,

91
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,406
you must be the same. Am I right?

92
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,509
( Nanbu Takashi (56) )
I'm heading there for my research.

93
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,112
Unlike you, I'm not here for the money.

94
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:51,517
But I thought all that research
would turn into money in the end.

95
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,420
Interview? Research? Money?

96
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,123
He's watching something!

97
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,125
Is it a sci-fi movie?

98
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,627
( Shogo Kano (43) )
Kids shouldn't look at other people's phones!

99
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,628
Get off!

100
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,831
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

101
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:11,104
It's okay because
I took a video of his phone screen!

102
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,206
I'm looking it up right now.

103
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,209
What do you think you're doing?

104
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,311
Delete that video right now!

105
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,813
- What?
- I said delete that video!

106
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,915
- Please stop...
- Excuse me.

107
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,917
Let go of me!

108
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,120
The candidate for Rum is unable to move.

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,922
I guess I have to use my tranquiliser dart...

110
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,127
Mr. Amuro!

111
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,828
Who are you?

112
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,503
How about we end this fight here?

113
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,404
And Mitsuhiko, you should delete
other people's private videos,

114
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,607
especially when they're
uncomfortable with it.

115
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,909
- Yes, sir.
- Will that be all?

116
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,110
Yeah.

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,413
You must be Amuro.

118
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,814
Yes, that's me.

119
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,818
I'm Kobayashi, the kids' class teacher.

120
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,320
I've heard so many things about you.

121
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,722
This is Amuro.

122
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,626
He works at a cafe,
but he's also a detective.

123
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,427
I'm Wakasa, the assistant class teacher.

124
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,929
Nice to meet you.

125
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,930
You too.

126
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,700
Mr. Amuro, why are you on this bus?

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,805
Like you, I'm also heading to
Hatoyama Farm for some business.

128
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,307
I see.

129
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,209
Well, a lot of things happened,

130
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,812
so I'll tell you more when we get there.

131
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,000
(Hatoyama Farm)

132
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,220
Nobody seems to be inside.

133
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,422
But the gate was wide open.

134
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,825
I don't see any cows, either.

135
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,820
Yeah.

136
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,828
I heard that the farm will be demolished

137
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,330
to make way for a golf course.

138
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,700
The employees aren't even around anymore.

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,503
That's why they're giving the chickens
to our school for free.

140
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,206
Yes, they said they might as well do so.

141
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,309
How about we take a look at the chickens

142
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,611
until the owner of the farm arrives?

143
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,113
Do you know where they might be?

144
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,250
They're probably going to be
where the arrow leads.

145
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,700
(Chicken Coop)
They're probably going to be where the arrow leads.

146
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,220
Seriously?

147
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,122
There's not a single chicken inside!

148
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,624
Why?

149
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,628
Could it be that they set aside
the two chickens they're giving away

150
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,230
and sold off the rest already?

151
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,432
Everyone, have a look outside!

152
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,401
Look! There's a huge hole in the wall!

153
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,704
Maybe they could've escaped from here.

154
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,305
You may be right.

155
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,307
Let's take a look somewhere else.

156
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,850
Yes.

157
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,214
What's with the pile of dirt
that's covering up the hole?

158
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,620
There's a toilet!

159
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,823
Nice! I've been holding my urge all this time.

160
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,820
Me too, actually.

161
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,827
Then let's take a toilet break

162
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,929
before going to find the owner of the farm.

163
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,030
You're right.

164
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,902
It's a chicken!

165
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,903
Hey, Conan.

166
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,706
You'd better tell us
the reason you came here.

167
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,650
Did I say that I would?

168
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,511
If I make a sound,

169
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,914
the chicken will run away from me.

170
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,716
I have to be quiet...

171
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,123
What? Yoshida has gone missing?

172
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,824
She seemed to have gone off somewhere

173
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,227
while we were on our toilet break.

174
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,429
Anyway, let's split up and look for her.

175
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,600
I'll go with Mr. Amuro,
Edogawa, and Tsuburaya.

176
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,304
Then I'll take Kojima and Haibara with me.

177
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,000
(Bishop)

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
(Bishop)
What's this?

179
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,414
(Bishop)
A shogi piece...

180
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,117
Hold on. I've seen this bishop piece somewhere.

181
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,919
What are you doing, Kojima?

182
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,120
We're leaving.

183
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,522
Okay.

184
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,920
I've got you!

185
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,228
What?

186
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,020
Where am I?

187
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,300
A lot of burnt twigs are scattered around.

188
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,403
There are also weird tracks on the ground.

189
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,006
And I wonder what this is.

190
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,911
What are these long and skinny things?

191
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,814
What?

192
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,615
Ayumi!

193
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,517
Yoshida!

194
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,190
If you can hear us, please answer!

195
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,320
Are you looking for someone?

196
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,425
What? Yes...

197
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,128
I'm the younger brother of Gisuke Hatoyama,

198
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,900
who owns Hatoyama Farm, Umisuke.

199
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,631
( Hatoyama Umisuke (37) )
who owns Hatoyama Farm, Umisuke.

200
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,190
( Hatoyama Umisuke (37) )
I haven't been able to

201
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,601
( Hatoyama Umisuke (37) )
contact my brother in the last two days,

202
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,503
so I came here to check on him.

203
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,406
We're looking for a girl
who came here with us.

204
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,208
She's a first-year in elementary school.

205
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,909
Have you seen her?

206
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,400
Yes.

207
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,812
I've seen her.

208
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,714
Really?

209
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,920
Perhaps...

210
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,320
This is the girl you're looking for?

211
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,022
- Oh, no...
- Ayumi!

212
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,260
Don't move.

213
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,629
First, put your phones on the ground,

214
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,820
and follow my instructions as we walk.

215
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,601
If you make any weird moves,

216
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,003
I will stab her.

217
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,605
(Hatoyama Farm)

218
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,600
Go down those stairs.

219
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,009
Goodbye.

220
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,000
Furuya?

221
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,316
Furuya, it's you!

222
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,419
You came to save me, didn't you?

223
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,722
- Kazami!
- Thank goodness! Now I'll be saved!

224
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,125
I've been caught too,
so things haven't changed.

225
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,328
I'm pretty sure this man
is Mr. Amuro's subordinate.

226
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,430
Excuse me...

227
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,432
Who's this "Furuya" you're referring to?

228
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,200
It's my alias.

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,303
I use it for my detective work.

230
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,405
And this is my assistant.

231
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,408
I'm Danroku Hida!

232
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,450
More importantly...

233
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,914
There's a body lying on the bed.

234
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,015
What?

235
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,617
And his face...

236
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,620
It's the same as the man
who trapped us here!

237
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:11,030
He's slightly older than
the person we met,

238
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,231
but they do look alike.

239
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,501
This is Gisuke Hatoyama!

240
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,404
He's the person who's giving the chickens
to Teitan Elementary School

241
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,606
and the owner of Hatoyama Farm!

242
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,808
Have you met him before?

243
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,711
No, we had only talked on the phone.

244
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,115
But I found pictures of him
when I looked him up online.

245
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:34,220
Then when that man said he was
the farm owner's younger brother,

246
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,422
he wasn't lying.

247
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:41,927
How about you tell us the real reason
you came to the farm?

248
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,430
That's because I received a call from Hida.

249
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,500
Yes. That was 30 hours ago.

250
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,501
I received information

251
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,804
that a large amount of explosives
were stolen from a construction site.

252
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,006
We were concerned
that a terrorist attack could occur,

253
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,008
so we tracked Umisuke Hatoyama,

254
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,310
who was one of the suspected workers.

255
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,713
That's how I came to the farm.

256
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,815
I was caught unaware and knocked out.

257
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,317
And when I came to,
I was already in this basement.

258
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,920
I was somehow able to contact Furuya...

259
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,922
I mean, Amuro using the deceased's phone.

260
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,025
I came here to help him escape

261
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,828
but was caught instead.

262
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,730
I see...

263
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,501
So detectives even do the same kind of work
as the secret police!

264
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,204
Well, they are public safety officials.

265
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,108
But what is Umisuke Hatoyama doing?

266
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,310
He killed his own brother

267
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,012
and stole explosives, too...

268
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,715
No, I believe that
Mr. Gisuke had killed himself.

269
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:37,716
Killed himself?

270
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,419
How could you tell?

271
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,823
There are marks left from
something around his neck,

272
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,226
but no signs of a struggle.

273
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,827
Is that so?

274
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,629
If someone else put a rope around his neck,

275
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,731
his nails would leave marks on it

276
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,450
from trying to take it off, right?

277
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,303
Things would be different
if both of his hands were tied,

278
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,305
but there aren't any marks on his wrists.

279
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,709
But if he were given a sleeping drug
before his neck was tied

280
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,011
and he was dropped from a high place...

281
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,113
I don't think that's what happened.

282
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:12,218
He probably hung himself
next to the desk in this room.

283
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,119
He's not wearing shoes either,

284
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,524
so he must have worn those boots.

285
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,228
I don't know if someone
laid him down on the bed...

286
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,930
But if someone did when he wore them,

287
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,233
wouldn't they have taken off the boots
and put them by the bed?

288
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,705
That can only mean
that he took off the boots himself

289
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,008
when he was getting onto that chair.

290
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,311
But when I came to,
the chair was upright.

291
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,913
I could see footprints on the seat as well,

292
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,215
even though they were wiped away

293
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,618
when I sat on it.

294
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,621
Were they footprints from a leather boot?

295
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,522
Come to think of it...

296
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,224
they were from a pair of leather shoes.

297
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:57,920
They must be the shoes of the man
who locked us in here.

298
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,490
It's likely that he discovered
his brother having hung himself

299
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,605
and got on the chair to
get him off of the rope.

300
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,108
The problem is why he tried to kill himself.

301
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,290
Perhaps he was researching something.

302
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,015
Look, there are highlighter stains

303
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,417
on the thumb and forefinger of his left hand.

304
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,718
You're right.

305
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,222
You use highlighters a lot while researching.

306
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,124
The colour gets on your left hand

307
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,826
if you can't cap the highlighter properly.

308
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,827
What's strange is that

309
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,831
there are pink, blue,
and yellow stains on his hand,

310
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,100
but only the yellow highlighter is missing

311
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,050
from his breast pocket.

312
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,105
I don't find it in the room,

313
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,007
so perhaps he misplaced

314
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,150
or dropped the yellow highlighter somewhere.

315
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:50,316
I'm more concerned about Ms. Wakasa
and the others who are outside.

316
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,519
If your phones were taken away,

317
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,910
there's no way to contact her.

318
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,323
There's no need to worry about that.

319
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:01,226
We have transceivers
on our detective badges.

320
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,329
What?

321
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,031
You're locked in the office basement

322
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,100
by the owner's brother?

323
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,203
Yes. We also found the owner's body

324
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,305
lying down in the basement, too.

325
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,707
Body?

326
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,509
So, did you find Ayumi?

327
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,512
Yes. He drugged her,

328
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,214
so she's still asleep.

329
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,516
We'll go and save you right away...

330
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,518
Wait! Don't rush in unprepared!

331
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,020
He's here with a large amount of explosives

332
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
that are stolen from the construction site!

333
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,323
Explosives?

334
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,426
There's no knowing what he'll do to you
if you're careless.

335
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,230
Anyway, the person who locked us up here
is Umisuke Hatoyama,

336
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,580
the farm owner's brother!

337
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,400
He's a man in his 30s with narrow eyes

338
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,960
and wearing a white safari hat.

339
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,305
Contact the police without him noticing...

340
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,800
Excuse me...

341
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,210
Are you looking for somebody?

342
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,912
Actually...

343
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,000
We were looking for the tourists
with children our age

344
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,916
who were on the bus with us earlier.

345
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,619
We wanted to get to know them better.

346
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,022
I see. You were talking about that family.

347
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,225
I told them that my brother,
the owner of the farm, isn't here,

348
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,227
so they left disappointed.

349
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,428
Is that so?

350
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,431
So he's away after all.

351
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,501
That's why there was no one at the office.

352
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,604
Well, it's my first time here
and I came alone,

353
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,107
so I ended up going around with this guy.

354
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,410
I'm not familiar with the area either,

355
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,412
so I thought I'd ask Mr. Hatoyama
about a few things

356
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,910
since I had met him once.

357
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,517
Something shocking
has happened to him recently,

358
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,018
so he's been admitted to a hospital.

359
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,420
He's in a hospital?

360
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,470
How's your brother doing?

361
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,224
He seems to be recovering,

362
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,126
but I received some instructions from him.

363
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,628
Instructions?

364
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,530
"Go to that place in the mountains."

365
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,631
"If you find it,"

366
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,132
"take it home without anyone else knowing"

367
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,450
"and hold on to it until I'm discharged."

368
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,305
What is the thing in the instructions?

369
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,707
I don't know.
It should be obvious if we go there.

370
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,509
How about we go there?

371
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,111
If you say you'll know when you go there.

372
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,215
Was it only you and the family
who came here on the bus?

373
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,716
There was someone else!

374
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,419
It was a huge and scary man!

375
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,321
Then let's find him,

376
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,422
and the four of us can go.

377
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,924
I wonder if we'll find him.

378
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,126
He went into the mountains
on his own, after all.

379
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,327
Okay, Haibara.

380
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,629
Call the police as soon as those men are gone.

381
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,432
I'm sorry but the battery
on my phone ran out.

382
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,402
And I left mine at home.

383
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,904
How about you use mine instead?

384
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,905
What?

385
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,509
Ms. Wakasa, there's a hole
in your back pocket.

386
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,610
What?

387
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,814
I don't have it. Is it gone?

388
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,316
Did you drop something?

389
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,419
Well, it's not that important...

390
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,323
Come to think of it, I saw Mr. Amuro
pick something up earlier.

391
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,225
It looked like a piece of wood.

392
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,726
The detective?

393
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,450
- Yes.
- We should contact the police right now!

394
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,830
You're right.

395
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,333
Ms. Wakasa!

396
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,507
I'm sorry, but we're unable to call the police.

397
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,608
Seriously?

398
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,210
In any case, the three of us
are heading to the office,

399
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,112
so let's continue when we get there.

400
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:17,022
Gosh. Where is it?

401
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,320
Just where am I?

402
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,426
A beam of light at night?

403
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,329
He was watching a movie about that?

404
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,430
Yes.

405
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,232
I heard someone saying,

406
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,802
"Who fired those skyrockets
in the middle of the mountains?"

407
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,004
in a low voice,

408
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,906
so I thought it was a sci-fi comedy.

409
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,450
Sci-fi comedy?

410
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,911
Furuya.

411
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,412
What have you been doing?

412
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,514
It's this shogi piece.

413
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,918
This bishop piece is damaged
on the lower left side.

414
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,620
I feel like I've seen this before somewhere.

415
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,222
When it comes to shogi,

416
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,124
you have to know about
Shukichi Haneda!

417
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,027
He's a master who has defended
his title six times.

418
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,828
How amazing!

419
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,500
Haneda...

420
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,200
Koji Haneda, the genius shogi player

421
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,700
who died mysteriously
in America 17 years ago!

422
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,304
(Bishop)
The only item missing from his belongings

423
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,006
(Bishop)
in that incident was a bishop piece

424
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,409
(Bishop)
that he kept as a good luck charm

425
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,090
(Bishop)
and never let go of.

426
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,915
The materials of unsolved and difficult cases
presented to me

427
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,116
during my police training mentioned that

428
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,119
it was the final piece
that was played in the first match

429
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,410
that he won against his master.

430
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,650
When Koji Haneda died,
his family said

431
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,626
there was no way he'd ever
let go of that shogi piece.

432
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:32,831
Only his murderer could have had it.

433
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,001
(Bishop)
The damage and the characters on the piece

434
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,003
(Bishop)
are strikingly similar to the ones I saw

435
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,650
(Bishop)
in the pictures back then.

436
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,707
It seems hard to believe,

437
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:47,813
but could Koji Haneda's murderer
be on this farm?

438
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,850
(Hatoyama Farm)

439
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,717
As I expected, it's impossible.

440
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,318
Even the back door is locked.

441
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,821
We can't enter the office like this!

442
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,127
Ms. Wakasa, are you all right?

443
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,428
Are you hurt?

444
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,630
No...

445
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,100
But it looks like we can get in now
that the windowpane is broken.

446
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,401
You're right.

447
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,107
Ayumi!

448
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,808
You're awake.

449
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,314
No! Get away from me!

450
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,715
Ayumi!

451
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,916
It's okay, Ayumi.

452
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,020
The guy who kidnapped you isn't here.

453
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,424
Do you remember what happened

454
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,925
when you were kidnapped?

455
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,228
Did you see anything out of the ordinary?

456
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:40,332
I was chasing a chicken

457
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,701
and ended up somewhere strange
in the forest.

458
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,403
Somewhere strange?

459
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:49,107
Yes. There were lots of
burnt twigs lying around!

460
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,009
Burnt twigs?

461
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:56,400
And there was also something
like a drain dug into the ground.

462
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,816
A drain?

463
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,920
The hole in the wall of the chicken coop.

464
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,823
The pile of dirt covering up a hole
in the ground.

465
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,025
The video of a beam lighting up the night
that angered the guy

466
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,728
when Mitsuhiko and Ayumi were looking at it.

467
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,731
And the countless burnt tree twigs

468
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,701
and the drain dug into the ground.

469
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,003
I've finally figured it out.

470
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,505
I've figured out the reason

471
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,008
why those three came here on the bus!

472
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,225
(Next Episode)
If I recall,

473
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,728
those three were wearing hiking boots.

474
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:54,132
I see! So that's why they all had magnets!

475
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,201
Did you see them with the magnets?

476
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,450
Yes.

477
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,005
But what do you want us to do?

478
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,400
I want you to make them for me.

479
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,209
If there is a possibility that

480
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,500
they're coming here wearing those boots,

481
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,513
things will be just as we expect.

482
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,216
Next Conan,

483
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:15,020
"The Live Coals on the Farm (Part 2)"

484
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,504
Next Conan's Hint:

485
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,806
"Highlighter"

486
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,590
Kazami, what are your summer holiday plans?

487
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,850
Are we even allowed to take a break?

488
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,611
Taking a break is part of work, too.
