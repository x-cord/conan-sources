1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,640
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,340
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,040
Pets are in trend now.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,540
They wag their tails to their masters,

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,240
but show their fangs to bad people!

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:17,509
"Good Work, Coeur"

10
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:32,209
You lose again, Coeur.

11
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,109
Musashi, you've got to learn to let girls win once in a while.

12
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,309
They're cute.

13
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:41,609
-They play fetch and everything, too? -Yes.

14
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:44,509
"Eisuke Tsutsumi (35)" -Golden Retrievers and Irish Setters

15
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:47,809
are originally improved breeds of hunting dogs

16
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,109
that were made to accompany hunters who shoot down birds.

17
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:52,409
"Hiroshi Yanagisawa (34)" -That's why they're good

18
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,609
at searching for and retrieving prey.

19
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,109
"Manami Yanagisawa (30)" -They usually play in the yard of the Tsutsumi's,

20
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,309
but we came since we heard that a dog-run was built in Beika Park.

21
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,509
"Misato Tsutsumi (33)" -It's our first time here,

22
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:06,409
but it's more spacious than we thought it would be.

23
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,209
Musashi and Coeur are delighted, too.

24
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:10,609
You're right.

25
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,909
It's spacious and feels great.

26
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:18,109
Are you the Tsutsumi couple with the big house in 4-chome?

27
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,609
Yes.

28
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,309
He's the president of a company that lives in that big house.

29
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:25,109
We just happened to get to know each other when we met walking the dog.

30
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:27,209
That was five months ago.

31
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,609
Musashi and Coeur are childhood friends.

32
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,809
Is that right?

33
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:35,309
Childhood friends.

34
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:39,109
I wonder where my "Musashi" is wandering around.

35
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,109
Hey, when did I become a dog?

36
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,309
Coeur, what are you eating?

37
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,209
She's always doing things like that.

38
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,609
Musashi does, too.

39
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,309
He eats grass, leaves, and even soil.

40
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:57,109
When we brushed his teeth some time ago, we found clay on his teeth.

41
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,509
Yes.

42
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:00,709
You mean dogs brush teeth, too?

43
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,309
Yes, after every meal.

44
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,309
After every meal?

45
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,609
They're even better than Pops.

46
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,009
Coeur! Musashi!

47
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,209
Okay, go for another run!

48
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,809
"Musashi (2)"

49
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:19,809
"Coeur (2)"

50
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,809
It was really fun, wasn't it?

51
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:33,909
Next time, we should take dad with us too, right?

52
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,409
But Pops prefers horse, doesn't he?

53
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,809
That's true. The ones wearing number bibs.

54
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:41,209
Yeah!

55
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,909
Hey, be quiet!

56
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,709
We have a guest.

57
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,509
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,109
The dog next door.

59
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,609
What was its name?

60
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,109
"Yoriko Nakatani (41)" -Musashi.

61
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,909
An Irish Setter named Musashi.

62
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,809
Musashi?

63
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:02,309
That dog Musashi barks and growls when he sees you?

64
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:05,309
Yes. He is a very big dog.

65
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:08,009
I can't help being afraid thinking

66
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,209
that I may be attacked by him one of these days.

67
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,409
Please help me, Mr. Mouri.

68
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,809
I'd like to help you if I could.

69
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,509
I moved into the house together with my husband who works in an office

70
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,109
at about the same time that the couple living next door did.

71
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:26,309
Both houses were originally owned by the same person.

72
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:30,809
The owner's parents used to live in the house that I live in now.

73
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,409
The only thing that separates our house with theirs

74
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,909
is a yard with a low hedge.

75
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:38,209
That's why even when I'm out in the yard,

76
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,109
I can't help thinking that Musashi's going to jump over the hedge

77
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,809
one of these days and attack me.

78
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,509
Then why don't you change that low hedge to a high fence?

79
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,309
I'd like to!

80
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:51,309
But my husband says he likes it the way it is now.

81
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,709
Even my mother-in-law who doesn't live with us says so.

82
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:58,009
Musashi is the dog owned by the Tsutsumi couple, right?

83
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,809
What? Do you know him?

84
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,409
Yes, just a bit.

85
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:04,409
It's true that Musashi is a big dog,

86
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,609
but he's very friendly

87
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:09,609
and I don't think he would ever bark or growl at people for no reason

88
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,709
much less, attack people.

89
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:15,909
Maybe you did something to Musashi that he didn't want you to do?

90
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,009
I didn't do anything!

91
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,409
How rude.

92
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,909
Never mind. I won't ask for your help anymore!

93
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:23,809
If anything ever happens to me,

94
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:26,409
Mr. Mouri, it's all your fault!

95
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,109
Huh? Well...

96
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:32,309
Look at what you did.

97
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,809
I'm sorry,

98
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,409
but Musashi would never do something like that, right?

99
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,309
Yeah.

100
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:42,309
But a little while afterwards, something terrible happens.

101
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:46,909
Are you all right?

102
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,409
Yes. I'll go inside the house.

103
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,409
Yeah.

104
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:54,609
What was that?

105
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,809
Dear, it's Musashi!

106
00:06:58,809 --> 00:06:59,809
Yeah.

107
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,509
Stay away! Stay away!

108
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,809
Dear, it's the woman next door!

109
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,109
Musashi! Stop it, Musashi!

110
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,409
Are you all right, Mrs. Nakatani?

111
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,409
My mother-in-law...

112
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,509
My mother-in-law...

113
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:28,909
It can't be...

114
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,009
Dear!

115
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,009
Yeah.

116
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,209
This is Mouri.

117
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:53,109
What did you just say? Musashi did?

118
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,209
Okay.

119
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,009
Yes, right away.

120
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,409
What about Musashi, dad?

121
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,209
He seems to have attacked Mrs. Nakatani's mother-in-law

122
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,009
and killed her.

123
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,009
What?

124
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,409
All done.

125
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,409
How many days will it take until I'll be able to walk?

126
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,609
Well...

127
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,109
Since you sprained in pretty badly,

128
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,809
I think it'll take at least four or five days.

129
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:19,209
Four or five days...

130
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,409
Take care.

131
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:21,409
Thank you.

132
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,309
Okay, please give me the details.

133
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,109
Yes. Yesterday at sundown,

134
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:30,809
my mother-in-law came over while my husband was out.

135
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,209
When I served my mother-in-law coffee,

136
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,909
I mistakenly spilled the coffee on her clothes,

137
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,009
so I had her wear my cardigan.

138
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,009
After that, I remembered that I hadn't taken in the laundry yet,

139
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:43,509
so I went to get them.

140
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,409
But I was careless and ended up

141
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:51,909
dropping one of my husband's shirts in the yard next door.

142
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:54,809
Unfortunately, the people next door seemed to be out.

143
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,109
Even if I wanted to go get it myself,

144
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:58,209
I was afraid of Musashi that I couldn't go.

145
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,809
Then my mother-in-law offered to go pick it up for me.

146
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,709
I stopped her saying that it's dangerous,

147
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:09,009
but she said she'd be fine because she knew him since he was a puppy.

148
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,909
Musashi,

149
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,409
you're such a good boy.

150
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:22,509
Mother!

151
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,509
Mother!

152
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:45,009
Stay away! Stay away!

153
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,609
Just then, Tsutsumi came to my rescue.

154
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:49,809
Yes.

155
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:52,809
We were supposed to come home late tonight because of a party,

156
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,209
but my wife didn't feel too well,

157
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,309
so we ended up coming home earlier than expected.

158
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,109
But thanks to that, I've been saved.

159
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,609
May I ask you something?

160
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:07,109
Why do you have that cane?

161
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:10,009
This is a spare cane that I bought for my mother-in-law

162
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,109
who always uses a cane.

163
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,709
What about those firecrackers?

164
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,309
I usually have them on me just in case Musashi attacks.

165
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:20,709
I heard that dogs don't like the sound of firecrackers.

166
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:21,809
I'll take those.

167
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:26,709
Inspector, my mother-in-law was wearing my cardigan

168
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,709
and was mistakenly attacked in my place!

169
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,109
That's why I went to seek help from you back then!

170
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:37,409
But even so...

171
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,909
Kinue was attacked here.

172
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,909
Yoriko fell

173
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,209
just about there.

174
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,009
Blood.

175
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,109
Yoriko wasn't hurt to the point where she was bleeding.

176
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:57,809
Which means that this is Kinue's blood?

177
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,009
But why in a place like this?

178
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:10,956
The results of the autopsy

179
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:16,256
shows that Mrs. Kinue Nakatani died of shock from excessive bleeding.

180
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,056
She died of shock.

181
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:21,656
The teeth marks found on her throat matched those of Musashi, too.

182
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,956
Musashi's saliva was also detected from the wound.

183
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:28,456
Why did Musashi attack Kinue?

184
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,756
He mistook her for Yoriko

185
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,256
because Kinue was wearing Yoriko's cardigan.

186
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:36,556
She said so yesterday, didn't she?

187
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:39,856
The dog's sense of smell, although it depends of what kind,

188
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:42,556
is said to be a billion times keener than that of humans.

189
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:44,856
So to tell the smell of Yoriko from the cardigan is...

190
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:48,156
If so, he would've also smelled Kinue, right?

191
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:51,556
If his sense of smell is so keen.

192
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,956
Right.

193
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:56,356
He may have been confused by the smell,

194
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,556
but it's unthinkable to think

195
00:11:57,556 --> 00:12:00,056
that he would completely mistake Kinue for Yoriko.

196
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:05,256
Besides, why did Musashi suddenly bite at Kinue's throat?

197
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,456
He would usually most likely bite the hands or the feet, right?

198
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,056
And the blood is strange, too.

199
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,256
The blood?

200
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,356
There were a few drops of blood

201
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:19,156
from where Yoriko was on the ground towards the hedge.

202
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:23,056
The forensic officers have verified that the blood was Kinue's.

203
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:26,756
It's most likely that when Yoriko tried to carry Kinue up,

204
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:28,156
blood dripped on her hand

205
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:30,756
and when she shook the cane with her blood stained hand, it splattered.

206
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:34,756
But then, isn't it weird that none of that blood came off near Musashi?

207
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,956
Now that he mentioned it, that's true.

208
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,156
It's just all child talk of this brat.

209
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:42,156
Don't let him confuse you.

210
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:44,656
Hey, aren't there other points that concern you?

211
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:46,856
Yeah, right.

212
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:49,756
First of all, we've found out that Yoriko and Kinue

213
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,956
are usually on bad terms with each other.

214
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:56,656
The one who testified is Yoriko's sister-in-law.

215
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,956
She explained that the reason for this is despite being 40 years old,

216
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:01,856
Yoriko's husband is still very dependent on his mother.

217
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,656
It seems that the shirt Yoriko dropped

218
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,156
was something that Kinue had bought for him.

219
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,956
So that's why Kinue went to get it herself.

220
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,956
Secondly, we found out that Kinue had a weak heart.

221
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,356
Her heart was weak?

222
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:18,856
Thirdly, the Tsutsumi couple living next door told us

223
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:22,356
that when they first moved here, Yoriko was very nice and friendly,

224
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:23,456
they can't remember when,

225
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:26,656
but she stopped talking to them even if she saw them.

226
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:30,556
Musashi himself used to like Yoriko at the start.

227
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,556
But from some time ago,

228
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:36,856
he began barking whenever he sensed Yoriko's presence.

229
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:39,356
By the way, it seems that Yoriko used to be an art teacher

230
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:42,256
at a junior high school.

231
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,656
The couple has no children.

232
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,756
But no matter how we look at it,

233
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,556
the circumstances point at Musashi having done it.

234
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:49,756
No way!

235
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:53,156
Conan, it isn't Musashi, is it?

236
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,456
Speaking of dogs attacking people,

237
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:57,856
remember John's case some time ago?

238
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,356
Listen, it's from your master.

239
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:07,256
The owner of the dog form a combination of certain words,

240
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,556
trained his dog to attack people.

241
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,056
However, in this case,

242
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,956
it's hard to believe that the Tsutsumi couple or Yoriko,

243
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:23,556
trained Musashi to attack people.

244
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:26,456
I got it! I've figured it out, Inspector Megure!

245
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:29,656
This is a thoroughly planned case of homicide!

246
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,156
Homicide?

247
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:34,156
The murderer is none other than Yoriko Nakatani.

248
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:37,156
She must've been looking for an opportunity to kill her mother-in-law

249
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,756
since she had been on bad terms with all this time.

250
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:44,256
Moreover, she hated the Tsutsumi couple as well as their pet dog, Musashi.

251
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:45,756
The couple, too?

252
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:47,056
The reason is most likely envy,

253
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:51,056
even though the couple is much younger than her and her husband,

254
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,956
they'd succeeded in business, have a spacious yard and a large house.

255
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,756
I see.

256
00:14:56,756 --> 00:15:02,056
So she thought up a way to kill Kinue.

257
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:07,156
First, she buys the same kind of cane that Kinue usually uses.

258
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,256
And while the Tsutsumi couple are out,

259
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,856
she probably poked Musashi through the hedge or something

260
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:14,156
and implanted enmity for her within him.

261
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:19,756
And when she did so, she also popped firecrackers and scared him.

262
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:26,056
Last night, after making sure that the Tsutsumi couple were out,

263
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:29,556
she called her mother-in-law, deliberately spilled coffee on her,

264
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:33,056
as an excuse to make Kinue wear the cardigan that had her smell on.

265
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:37,656
And for some reason, she decides to take in the laundry at night,

266
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:40,656
drops her husband's favourite shirt

267
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:43,656
and make it so that Kinue goes out to get it.

268
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:49,556
Musashi realizes that Kinue had entered his territory

269
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:53,156
and sees the cane that he hates.

270
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:56,756
On top of that, he smells someone that he hates,

271
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:01,656
so he must've growled threatening them not to come any closer.

272
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,756
Then Yoriko came up from behind.

273
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,856
Yoriko took advantage of the sense of sight, smell and sound of the dog

274
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:21,456
to commit a cleverly schemed and daring crime.

275
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,956
Kinue who had a weak heart, could've had a heart attack,

276
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:28,856
just by being frightened at Musashi attacking her.

277
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:32,356
But Musashi bit her in the throat,

278
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:36,156
causing excessive bleeding causing death by shock.

279
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:39,456
It turned out better than you expected.

280
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,156
Is it true, Yoriko?

281
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,456
Famed detective, my foot.

282
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:48,556
I hope you have proof for saying all you did.

283
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,956
I will show you proof now.

284
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:55,256
But before that, could you please lend me the clothes you're wearing now?

285
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:56,456
That cane, too.

286
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,356
Listen.

287
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:10,556
Pull the leash and stop Musashi

288
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:13,056
the instant Officer Sato pops the firecracker

289
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,956
and when he's about to pounce onto her.

290
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,456
Yes, sir. I understand.

291
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:20,256
Officer Takagi, I'll leave it to you.

292
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,256
Officer Sato, even if I have to risk my own life, I will.

293
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,356
If Musashi gets excited at the sound of the firecracker,

294
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,156
then he's the one that did it.

295
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,356
Or it could be that...

296
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,756
Okay! Let him go!

297
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:57,756
Okay, come.

298
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,456
Good boy, good boy.

299
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:00,656
It can't be!

300
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,756
See? It's just as I said, isn't it?

301
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,656
I see.

302
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,556
I heard about the case on the news and was worried.

303
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,656
Is Musashi still at the police station?

304
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:18,256
Yes. Kinue trespassed on private property,

305
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:22,756
so I don't think the Tsutsumi couple or Musashi will be held responsible.

306
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:27,956
I'll have to gather more info to get to the truth.

307
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:31,556
Why don't we go to the Tsutsumi's residence from now?

308
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,256
Okay. Sounds good.

309
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,456
Huh? You're going to move?

310
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:41,656
Yeah.

311
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,656
Although we won't be punished by law,

312
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,556
the fact that Musashi attacked Kinue and killed her will not disappear.

313
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,656
We can't live here anymore.

314
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:50,956
Is that so?

315
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:55,056
What did you find this time?

316
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:56,456
What's this?

317
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:57,456
That's...

318
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,456
Musashi's toothbrush.

319
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,356
Toothbrush?

320
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:05,856
When we brushed his teeth some time ago, we found clay on his teeth.

321
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,456
By the way, it seems that Yoriko used to be an art teacher

322
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,456
at a junior high school.

323
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:12,456
Don't tell me that...

324
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:17,256
Clay. If so...

325
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:47,156
Our deduction that you lured Musashi into attacking Kinue was wrong.

326
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:49,256
Musashi didn't do anything.

327
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:52,556
You're the one who killed Kinue.

328
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:55,756
Just what do you mean by "I'm the one", Inspector Megure?

329
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:04,856
You made Musashi bite clay and took the mold of his teeth

330
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,156
and made a mold of his teeth using plaster.

331
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:11,056
You used the experience you had when you used to be an art teacher.

332
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:14,556
That night, you pushed Kinue who went out to the yard next door

333
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:17,656
to pick up the shirt that you deliberately dropped.

334
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,456
Musashi was severely agitated by the violence he'd witnessed

335
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,256
and began to bark loudly.

336
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,356
You made Musashi pull away using the firecrackers

337
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:31,056
and meant to go back into the house during that time,

338
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:33,856
but you sprained your ankle.

339
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:39,056
After that, you told the Tsutsumi couple that Kinue was attacked.

340
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:40,656
And while the Tsutsumi couple

341
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,556
were distracted with their attention on Kinue,

342
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,856
you threw the mold of Musashi's teeth towards the yard of your house.

343
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:54,256
This teeth mold made of plaster solved everything.

344
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:56,656
Conan is the one who found it.

345
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,756
That's not true.

346
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,056
Coeur's the one who found it.

347
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:03,656
Musashi's saliva was on Kinue's wound

348
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:05,556
because dogs have a habit of licking themselves and others of their pack

349
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,256
in order to heal the wound, right?

350
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:11,856
She took advantage of this.

351
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,656
Do you have anything to say to it?

352
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:17,756
That woman...

353
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,656
She used to look next door and always sigh and say each time she came here,

354
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,956
that one should choose a bride carefully.

355
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:25,956
Just because of something like that?

356
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,556
Yes, just something like that!

357
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:30,456
Since you forever clung to your mother despite your age,

358
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,356
you would probably never understand!

359
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:36,456
If only I didn't sprain my leg...

360
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:38,556
Your leg will heal in time!

361
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:40,156
But before that,

362
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:42,956
I think you have something that you should fix, isn't there?

363
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:20,356
Hey, I've been wondering from before.

364
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:23,656
The name Coeur doesn't sound too feminine.

365
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:26,156
Could it be that it's not English?

366
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,056
Yes. It's Coeur in French.

367
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,856
I had no idea.

368
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:34,556
It means "heart" in French.

369
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:35,956
Heart.

370
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:41,056
I'm sure she had the heart of wanting to save her childhood friend.

371
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,356
I wonder if my Musashi feels that way about me?

372
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,456
I'm sure he does.

373
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:48,656
Nope, he doesn't.

374
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:52,956
Because when there's a case, his heart's nowhere near here.

375
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:56,656
You've got me there.

376
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,256
Conan, did you say something?

377
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:02,956
"Next Episode" -If the killer came into the room and battered him to death,

378
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:05,656
the killer is most likely an acquaintance.

379
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,856
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

380
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,756
Hey, Ms. Kobayashi.

381
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:14,756
You told Mr. Sugimori that we're going to be interviewed, right?

382
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,856
The voices of the four suspects.

383
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,856
That person must've loved animals.

384
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:23,556
This could be...

385
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:29,756
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 1)"

386
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:33,241
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:35,041
"Hay fever"

388
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,941
Officer Sato, do you have hay fever?

389
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:37,941
Yes.

390
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,141
Then, so do I.
