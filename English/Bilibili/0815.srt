1
00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:03.682
We came to the cake buffet at a hotel that Doc won

2
00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:06.782
after spinning the lottery.

3
00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:10.182
There, we ran into two actress bloggers,

4
00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:12.182
Saya Kitami and Kyono Shono

5
00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.982
who were competing for blog popularity ranking.

6
00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.582
However, although it's almost time for shooting, Kyona doesn't wake up.

7
00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:23.282
Sakurako Yonehara, who is worried about Kyona,

8
00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:26.882
asks the bellboy to open the door of her room, and there they find...

9
00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:29.682
Kyona, what's wrong?

10
00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:31.982
Shooting's going to start!

11
00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:36.182
Kyona? Kyona?

12
00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:37.682
Kyona...

13
00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:48.682
What's the matter?

14
00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.782
Please call an ambulance and the police!

15
00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:52.982
What? Oh, all right!

16
00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.682
What's this?

17
00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:01.382
Conan, that's a card key, isn't it?

18
00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:02.482
Yep.

19
00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:04.682
But, that's strange.

20
00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:07.182
This hotel isn't auto lock.

21
00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:11.682
-What? -How did the perp lock the room?

22
00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.582
It's a locked room murder.

23
00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:18.582
What's this white stain?

24
00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:22.682
Whipped cream?

25
00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.982
Which means...

26
00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:26.482
Who on earth...

27
00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:29.782
Who could've done something terrible like this?

28
00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:31.982
Don't tell me that the perp...

29
00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:35.982
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

30
00:01:35.982 --> 00:01:38.182
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

31
00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:39.982
The key point of the locked room murder

32
00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:42.382
was an ordinary toy and small prop.

33
00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:43.982
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:45.782
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:47.882
His name is Detective Conan!

36
00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:38.795
"The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case (Part 2)"

37
00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:44.695
And? How about it?

38
00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:47.595
Did you figure out the locked room trick?

39
00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:49.795
No, not yet.

40
00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:51.995
But, I have an idea how the perp made it in the room

41
00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:53.595
and the murder weapon!

42
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:58.395
What? Then are you saying that the TV talent is the perp after all?

43
00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:00.595
Yeah, no mistake about it.

44
00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:01.695
No.

45
00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:05.095
She seems to be so kind.

46
00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:08.295
The outward appearance and inside of a woman are different, you know.

47
00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:09.995
Although the lady who was killed

48
00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:13.495
seemed to have a foul mouth, was vulgar and rude,

49
00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:14.595
if you look at her blog,

50
00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:18.695
you'll see that she had a sensitive and meticulous side too.

51
00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:21.995
What? How did you find something like that out?

52
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.695
The bottles of manicure were lined out in order by number,

53
00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:27.795
despite it being a brand where you couldn't see the number

54
00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:29.795
unless it was turned over.

55
00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:31.095
What?

56
00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:34.195
Wait a sec. Then, that picture...

57
00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:41.695
I see. So this is the secret that she found out about.

58
00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:45.895
But, would a person commit murder just for something like this?

59
00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:47.195
Wait a sec.

60
00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:49.995
Wait.

61
00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:52.895
In English, this would be?

62
00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:00.395
I sort of feel hungry.

63
00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:02.195
What? Already?

64
00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:06.095
You said you were full just a while ago, didn't you?

65
00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:09.295
Doc, make something for me, will you?

66
00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:13.395
Why not go home and eat dinner like you're supposed to?

67
00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:19.395
But, Mom and Dad are at a gathering of the shopping arcade

68
00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:22.395
and aren't going to be home till late tonight.

69
00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:25.695
If I eat too much, Mom will get angry

70
00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:27.595
so make me something like dessert, won't you?

71
00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:30.995
You ate so much cake and you still want dessert?

72
00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:35.195
Geez. You're really a glutton, Genta.

73
00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:37.695
Would you like some cheese cake, then?

74
00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:40.495
I was thinking of making one tomorrow

75
00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:42.695
so I already bought the ingredients.

76
00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:44.895
All right.

77
00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:48.595
You get to eat yours at breakfast tomorrow, Doc.

78
00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:50.195
Give me a break.

79
00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:55.895
But, won't it take time till it's ready?

80
00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:57.395
It seems I'll be able to make it

81
00:05:57.395 --> 00:06:00.195
in 30 to 40 minutes if I use the rice cooker.

82
00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:02.295
Huh? Rice cooker?

83
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.395
Yes! The function of the rice cooker

84
00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:06.795
is not limited just to making rice!

85
00:06:06.795 --> 00:06:10.095
It can also make delicious cake!

86
00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:14.495
I see. So, that's the story.

87
00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:17.295
The perp didn't use what the function was originally meant for

88
00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:19.395
and turned that room into a locked room.

89
00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:24.095
In order to hide her past mistake.

90
00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:29.795
But, this case is sure one filled with mysteries.

91
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:31.495
The victim was saying that

92
00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:35.495
she wouldn't open the door unless the housekeeper, Sakurako came

93
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:40.595
but the perp got into the room, and killed the victim.

94
00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:42.995
The doors of the rooms of this hotel aren't auto lock and yet,

95
00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:45.695
the card key was on the floor in the bedroom

96
00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:47.695
away from the entrance,

97
00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:50.095
and the way the perp made it away after committing the crime

98
00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:52.095
is not known at all.

99
00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:55.795
On top of that, the stick like weapon that

100
00:06:55.795 --> 00:06:59.895
the victim was struck to death with hasn't been found yet.

101
00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:01.495
The only thing we know is that

102
00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:04.495
the victim is TV talent, Ms. Kyona Shono,

103
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:08.695
and that there's going to be quite a fuss after this.

104
00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.395
Shall we ask the Chief what to do?

105
00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.495
Yeah, I guess.

106
00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:16.595
Who is it?

107
00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:17.995
Oh, well...

108
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:21.095
Hey, hold it there.

109
00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:26.195
Dr. Agasa?

110
00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:29.495
And, what is it you want?

111
00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:32.395
Conan?

112
00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:34.795
Huh, where's Dr. Agasa?

113
00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:39.695
Dr. Agasa's waiting for you in room 504, Inspector!

114
00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:44.195
-Huh? -In the room of the perp right below this room!

115
00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:47.495
Room 504 right below?

116
00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:50.895
That's the room of TV talent Ms. Saya Kitami!

117
00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:52.895
Yep, that's right!

118
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:54.895
Conan.

119
00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:58.295
I think it's too difficult for you to understand

120
00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.495
but the room was locked and...

121
00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:02.595
Inspector!

122
00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:07.695
The Chief called to say, do as Conan says.

123
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:08.895
Huh?

124
00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:14.895
Please explain this so I understand.

125
00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:18.795
Why am I the perp who killed Kyona?

126
00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:23.095
The card key was in the room, so the room was locked, correct?

127
00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:26.495
Moreover, it seemed that Kyona said

128
00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:29.295
she would open the door only for Sakurako.

129
00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:32.995
If you're going to suspect anyone, I think it should be Sakurako.

130
00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:35.695
Well, it may be but...

131
00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:37.495
Doctor Agasa is...

132
00:08:40.295 --> 00:08:43.195
If you look through the peek hole of the door,

133
00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:47.495
you'll see how the perp got into to the room.

134
00:08:47.495 --> 00:08:49.495
I tell you.

135
00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.595
Who is it now?

136
00:08:53.195 --> 00:08:54.995
Dr. Agasa?

137
00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:59.895
It can't be...

138
00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:08.695
What on earth's...

139
00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:22.862
What on earth's going on here?

140
00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:25.162
We did it!

141
00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:28.062
-Huh? -We tricked you!

142
00:09:28.062 --> 00:09:30.162
A total success!

143
00:09:30.162 --> 00:09:32.862
Then, you guys did that?

144
00:09:32.862 --> 00:09:34.662
Yes, that's right.

145
00:09:35.562 --> 00:09:39.662
We recorded Doc's video beforehand on the cell phone

146
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:43.562
and put the cell phone up against the peek hole and played the video.

147
00:09:45.762 --> 00:09:48.762
Then, Dr. Agasa that I saw a while ago too was...

148
00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:50.062
Yeah, that's correct!

149
00:09:50.062 --> 00:09:54.162
I made Conan do the same thing.

150
00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:59.362
The same thing that Saya did when she went into Kyona's room.

151
00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:01.562
I see.

152
00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:05.962
Saya recorded Sakurako's video on her cell phone

153
00:10:05.962 --> 00:10:10.162
and used it to go into Kyona's room.

154
00:10:10.162 --> 00:10:14.962
But I met Sakuroko for the first time today.

155
00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:17.662
I didn't have time to take such a video!

156
00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:18.962
Right, don't you agree?

157
00:10:18.962 --> 00:10:20.362
Yes.

158
00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:24.762
Sakurako, when Saya told you to come to her room and you went there,

159
00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:27.762
you said that something was posted on the door, didn't you?

160
00:10:27.762 --> 00:10:30.462
Huh? Yes. There was an envelope...

161
00:10:31.662 --> 00:10:33.062
An envelope?

162
00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:37.362
Yes. An envelope with a large black heart mark drawn on it.

163
00:10:37.362 --> 00:10:42.462
It was posted right below the peekhole of the door of Saya's room.

164
00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:46.762
Saya said that it was prank played by one of her fans though.

165
00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:50.862
The cell phone was in that envelope.

166
00:10:50.862 --> 00:10:54.062
There was a hole made shaped like a heart,

167
00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:56.162
and the cell phone was put inside

168
00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:58.862
so that the camera lens would fit right into the hole.

169
00:10:58.862 --> 00:11:01.362
Then, if it were in record mode,

170
00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:07.162
the image of you pushing the doorbell would be taken.

171
00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:10.162
Both the rooms of Kyona and Saya

172
00:11:10.162 --> 00:11:12.762
are at the dead end of the corridor.

173
00:11:12.762 --> 00:11:16.162
Therefore, the background would look exactly the same too.

174
00:11:16.162 --> 00:11:17.562
But...

175
00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:19.562
What about the card key?

176
00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:23.062
It was near the corpse that was in the bedroom beyond, you know!

177
00:11:23.062 --> 00:11:25.862
The doors of this hotel aren't auto lock,

178
00:11:25.862 --> 00:11:28.262
so how did I get out of the room after committing the murder

179
00:11:28.262 --> 00:11:30.962
and lock the door?

180
00:11:30.962 --> 00:11:34.562
You probably used this toy helicopter

181
00:11:34.562 --> 00:11:38.062
that you flew at the cake buffet, right?

182
00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:40.262
Helicopter?

183
00:11:41.462 --> 00:11:44.462
Will you lend me the card key to this room?

184
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:45.962
Here you go.

185
00:11:46.762 --> 00:11:51.962
First, you stick the axis of the rotary shaft of the propeller

186
00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:54.462
onto the rear of the helicopter

187
00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:57.662
with a long string using scotch tape.

188
00:11:57.662 --> 00:12:00.862
Then you tie the scotch tape on the end of the string

189
00:12:00.862 --> 00:12:03.262
that is attached to the rotary shaft,

190
00:12:03.262 --> 00:12:07.462
and then stick that scotch tape lightly onto the card key.

191
00:12:07.462 --> 00:12:11.362
Then you put the helicopter on the floor of the bedroom

192
00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:13.462
and stick it on lightly.

193
00:12:13.462 --> 00:12:15.262
There, all done!

194
00:12:15.262 --> 00:12:17.462
Finally, hold the two strings,

195
00:12:17.462 --> 00:12:21.862
and pull the string out from under the door,

196
00:12:21.862 --> 00:12:26.162
slide the card key from under the space of the locked door

197
00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.762
and move the helicopter.

198
00:12:30.262 --> 00:12:32.362
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you guys!

199
00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:33.562
Okay!

200
00:12:39.662 --> 00:12:41.262
I inserted it.

201
00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:43.162
Okay, start!

202
00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:44.262
Okay!

203
00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:45.862
Here goes!

204
00:12:45.862 --> 00:12:47.562
Switch on!

205
00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:52.562
When the helicopter is moved,

206
00:12:52.562 --> 00:12:55.362
the string will be wound by the rotary shaft

207
00:12:55.362 --> 00:12:57.762
and the card key will slide smoothly through

208
00:12:57.762 --> 00:13:00.862
the space under the door into the room beyond.

209
00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:04.162
Then after the rotary shaft winds up all the string,

210
00:13:04.162 --> 00:13:09.062
they card key will be cut off from the string due to the impact,

211
00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:11.462
and fall to the floor!

212
00:13:12.462 --> 00:13:16.662
I see! You deliberately don't fly the helicopter

213
00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:19.462
and use it only to wound the string.

214
00:13:19.462 --> 00:13:21.762
Yep! And to finish it off, all you do is

215
00:13:21.762 --> 00:13:25.262
pull the string that is attached to the rear from outside the room!

216
00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:28.462
Hey! Pull!

217
00:13:28.462 --> 00:13:29.462
Okay!

218
00:13:32.362 --> 00:13:35.962
Then, the helicopter will peel off from the floor

219
00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:40.462
and move all the way to the entrance of the room.

220
00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:44.062
And if you pull the string with all your might

221
00:13:44.062 --> 00:13:46.062
when the helicopter bumps into the door...

222
00:13:46.062 --> 00:13:47.162
There!

223
00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:53.062
See, you can retrieve the string too!

224
00:13:53.062 --> 00:13:55.062
You're right.

225
00:13:55.062 --> 00:13:58.662
As proof of that, on the floor near the card key,

226
00:13:58.662 --> 00:14:01.362
there was white whipped cream, right?

227
00:14:02.362 --> 00:14:03.362
Yeah.

228
00:14:03.362 --> 00:14:06.662
That's because the whipped cream was on the skid

229
00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:09.162
that's attached under the helicopter!

230
00:14:09.462 --> 00:14:11.562
Because Saya's helicopter

231
00:14:11.562 --> 00:14:15.462
fell onto the cake that Genta was about to eat!

232
00:14:18.162 --> 00:14:22.762
But, Conan, the helicopter should still be in the room, right?

233
00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:27.662
Yep, that's why Saya dropped her cap

234
00:14:27.662 --> 00:14:29.362
as soon as she entered Kyona's room!

235
00:14:29.362 --> 00:14:30.562
Huh?

236
00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:32.962
She pretended to have missed putting her cap on the cap holder

237
00:14:32.962 --> 00:14:34.562
and dropped it.

238
00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:38.162
If she had double stick tape attached to the inside of her cap,

239
00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:43.162
it should stay even if she put it on the cap holder.

240
00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:48.162
So it's probably still there.

241
00:14:48.162 --> 00:14:54.962
Inside her cap is the Petite Falcon used to commit the crime!

242
00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.262
The string is still wound onto it too.

243
00:14:58.262 --> 00:15:00.262
There seems to be no doubt about it.

244
00:15:00.262 --> 00:15:01.862
Wrong!

245
00:15:01.862 --> 00:15:03.362
I didn't do it!

246
00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:05.662
That double stick tape

247
00:15:05.662 --> 00:15:09.262
was originally on there so that the cap wouldn't fall out of place.

248
00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:13.262
Right, so I think it coincidentally got stuck there

249
00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:16.262
when I dropped my cap.

250
00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:20.262
Then, why did you get on top of the table?

251
00:15:22.762 --> 00:15:25.062
When I got the Petite Falcon

252
00:15:25.062 --> 00:15:28.462
stuck to the ventilator of the air conditioner,

253
00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:31.362
you got onto the table and took it off for me, right?

254
00:15:37.162 --> 00:15:38.962
You're fantastic, just great!

255
00:15:38.962 --> 00:15:42.262
Oh, come on, it's quite easy.

256
00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.862
Oh no! It got stuck on the air conditioner.

257
00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:49.862
I need a pole.

258
00:15:56.462 --> 00:15:58.862
-Here you go! -Thank you!

259
00:15:58.862 --> 00:16:03.562
Back then, there were teacups on the table,

260
00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.462
so normally you wouldn't get on as is, right?

261
00:16:06.462 --> 00:16:08.462
That's because...

262
00:16:08.462 --> 00:16:10.762
Besides, right in front of you,

263
00:16:11.962 --> 00:16:14.262
there was a self-photo taking pole too.

264
00:16:15.462 --> 00:16:17.662
Self-photo taking pole?

265
00:16:17.662 --> 00:16:20.362
Oh, a self-photo taking pole

266
00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:22.862
is a pole where you attach the cell phone at the tip

267
00:16:22.862 --> 00:16:24.862
and take a photo of yourself.

268
00:16:24.862 --> 00:16:27.262
It's a convenient thing

269
00:16:27.262 --> 00:16:29.462
where you can take pictures of yourself from a distance

270
00:16:29.462 --> 00:16:31.662
if you extend the pole.

271
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:39.162
If you misuse it, it could turn into a murder weapon.

272
00:16:39.162 --> 00:16:43.662
Kyona's blog was full of self-photos of herself,

273
00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:48.162
but Saya's blog had no self-taken photos whatsoever.

274
00:16:48.162 --> 00:16:53.262
That's why that's probably Kyona's self-photo taking pole.

275
00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:57.562
Will you please explain, Ms. Saya Kitami?

276
00:16:58.562 --> 00:17:01.362
Why Kyona's self-photo taking pole

277
00:17:01.362 --> 00:17:05.062
was smeared with blood and found in your room?

278
00:17:13.062 --> 00:17:15.562
Why else?

279
00:17:15.562 --> 00:17:18.662
That woman found out about my secret.

280
00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:21.062
I used that pole that was in her room

281
00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:24.762
to shut that blabber mouth up for good!

282
00:17:24.762 --> 00:17:26.662
Secret?

283
00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:32.062
See! That woman had the nerve to upload my secret on her blog!

284
00:17:33.362 --> 00:17:38.162
By making it look as if she was introducing the comics that she liked!

285
00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:40.562
Where's the secret?

286
00:17:40.562 --> 00:17:45.262
Beside her face, see, it says "Hit and Run of Love"!

287
00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:51.262
In Japanese, "hit and run" is a baseball term,

288
00:17:51.262 --> 00:17:52.862
but in English...

289
00:17:53.862 --> 00:17:56.062
It means to run someone over and flee. Correct?

290
00:17:56.062 --> 00:17:57.862
Yes, that's right.

291
00:17:57.862 --> 00:18:05.162
Two years ago, I ran someone over a drunk man,

292
00:18:05.162 --> 00:18:08.962
I had it hidden all this time, and yet that woman...

293
00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:12.362
she had the nerve to tell me this when I forced myself into her room.

294
00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:20.562
Hey, just what's going on? You're an hour early?

295
00:18:20.562 --> 00:18:22.862
Saya...

296
00:18:22.862 --> 00:18:24.462
Where's Sakurako?

297
00:18:24.462 --> 00:18:26.062
She's not here!

298
00:18:26.062 --> 00:18:28.762
Just what're you doing?

299
00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:30.362
I'm not doing anything!

300
00:18:30.362 --> 00:18:34.062
Hey! Stop yelling!

301
00:18:34.062 --> 00:18:36.362
Oh, I get it.

302
00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:43.962
Did you figure it out the code in that photo of the comics?

303
00:18:43.962 --> 00:18:46.162
And? What're you going to do about it?

304
00:18:46.162 --> 00:18:47.362
Are you going to back off

305
00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:49.362
from the blog ranking popularity competition

306
00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:53.762
or bring everything to light?

307
00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:54.862
"Hit and Run of Love"

308
00:18:58.862 --> 00:19:02.462
Maybe a shaved head will be more becoming on you than you think.

309
00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:05.762
You may get an avalanche of offers for acting as a nun.

310
00:19:05.762 --> 00:19:08.962
Then, you may become even more popular than you are now.

311
00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:11.862
If so, it'd be thanks to me, right?

312
00:19:11.862 --> 00:19:13.962
You'd better be grateful!

313
00:19:38.862 --> 00:19:45.862
Saya, I don't think Kyona knew about the hit and run.

314
00:19:45.862 --> 00:19:46.962
Huh?

315
00:19:46.962 --> 00:19:49.562
But the photo...

316
00:19:49.562 --> 00:19:52.362
she said it was the code of the comic book.

317
00:19:52.362 --> 00:19:57.262
The thing that she coded was not the "Hit and Run"

318
00:19:57.262 --> 00:20:01.162
but the one next to it, "To You".

319
00:20:01.162 --> 00:20:02.762
Being as meticulous as she was,

320
00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:05.962
only the series of that book was not placed in order,

321
00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:08.762
and there were two copies of volume 11.

322
00:20:09.362 --> 00:20:10.962
If you place the episodes

323
00:20:10.962 --> 00:20:13.862
in order to the 50 sounds of the Japanese alphabet,

324
00:20:13.862 --> 00:20:18.862
leaving only episode 29 in place, it reads,

325
00:20:18.862 --> 00:20:22.362
"Saya is actually 29 years old!"

326
00:20:25.662 --> 00:20:30.162
All she did was code that phrase to expose that

327
00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:34.162
you were 5 years older than you claimed to be.

328
00:20:34.162 --> 00:20:36.062
No.

329
00:20:36.062 --> 00:20:39.862
But, since you were caught up in your past,

330
00:20:39.862 --> 00:20:43.562
only the words "Hit and Run" caught your eye.

331
00:20:43.562 --> 00:20:48.862
In baseball terms, the words "hit and run" mean a sink or swim play.

332
00:20:48.862 --> 00:20:53.962
But I guess for you, it meant sinking into the wells of punishment?

333
00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:37.862
Well, Dr. Agasa, a fantastic deduction as always!

334
00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:39.162
You were indeed a great help!

335
00:22:39.162 --> 00:22:40.962
Not at all.

336
00:22:42.962 --> 00:22:45.762
By the way, Conan.

337
00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:49.562
I'm surprised that you were acquainted with the Chief!

338
00:22:49.562 --> 00:22:52.462
Huh? But the chief of the 1st Investigation Division

339
00:22:52.462 --> 00:22:54.362
is Superintendant Matsumoto, right?

340
00:22:54.362 --> 00:22:55.362
No, well...

341
00:22:55.362 --> 00:23:02.162
I knew you'd help in solving the case.

342
00:23:08.562 --> 00:23:12.962
After all, you're the wisdom bag of the Sleeping Kogoro.

343
00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:18.662
Who are you?

344
00:23:18.662 --> 00:23:22.762
I'm Hyoe Kuroda who has been appointed

345
00:23:22.762 --> 00:23:26.562
as Chief of the 1st Investigation Division of MPD

346
00:23:26.562 --> 00:23:28.762
in place of Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto.

347
00:23:28.762 --> 00:23:31.262
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

348
00:23:31.962 --> 00:23:34.562
Oh, what a polite greeting.

349
00:23:34.562 --> 00:23:36.862
Same here.

350
00:23:39.962 --> 00:23:43.562
Hello again.

351
00:23:43.562 --> 00:23:46.062
Conan Edogawa.

352
00:23:58.062 --> 00:24:00.462
There's no such thing as an ET.

353
00:24:00.462 --> 00:24:03.262
There is! My Father who died said so!

354
00:24:03.262 --> 00:24:05.462
It's an ET! Help!

355
00:24:09.462 --> 00:24:12.662
There might be something behind last night's incident.

356
00:24:12.662 --> 00:24:15.462
I guess it's show time for us.

357
00:24:15.962 --> 00:24:21.362
