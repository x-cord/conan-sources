1
00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:03.185
Yes.

2
00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:08.445
The one who murdered Machiko-san
and hid her body in the well...

3
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:13.185
Wait! Don't tell us it was
the guy with the sunglasses!

4
00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:17.135
He's probably our mom's
brother, who blames us

5
00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:21.205
for her death when she fell
into the well fifteen years ago!

6
00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:27.965
He has a motive, but could you
save this for until after he's caught?!

7
00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:31.225
No. He's likely a
detective someone hired

8
00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:35.975
to determine if Mr. Yoshifusa
really is who he claims to be.

9
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:40.055
H-Hold on. If he's not the killer, then...

10
00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:41.735
Y-You can't mean...

11
00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:49.245
Yes. Machiko-san's
killer is in this very room!

12
00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:56.495
Hey, now! You heard that she
called from the hotel at 9:00 last night!

13
00:00:56.495 --> 00:01:01.435
Even if she left right after calling,
she'd arrive here after 10:00.

14
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:05.505
We were all in the same room then,
so we couldn't have done it!

15
00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.475
Might this be possible?

16
00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:12.515
Just after 8:00, Machiko-san
made her first call from the party,

17
00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:15.015
then left the party immediately after.

18
00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.935
Just after 9:00, she parked
the car in the woods

19
00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:23.515
and played back a tape recording
of the party on the car stereo

20
00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.025
while making her second call.

21
00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:29.535
To make it seem as
if she was still at the party.

22
00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:35.325
She was the one who was killed.
Why would she create an alibi?

23
00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:38.635
Because things wound up just the opposite.

24
00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:39.335
Opposite?

25
00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:42.295
What do you mean?

26
00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:48.965
Machiko-san planned to use
that alibi trick and kill someone.

27
00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:53.265
But she wound up being
killed by that person instead.

28
00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:55.635
What now?!

29
00:01:55.635 --> 00:02:04.445
Ironically, her trick wound up
helping the alibi of her killer instead.

30
00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.725
The raincoat found in the well...

31
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:13.995
She put it on beforehand to keep
her victim's blood off her clothes.

32
00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:17.055
And the camellia flower...

33
00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:22.055
She had it in her pocket so she could
drop it at the murder scene later

34
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:25.645
to make it look connected
to the incident fifteen years ago.

35
00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:29.975
As for the tape lying by the firewood,

36
00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:35.975
she either dropped it on her way
to her target who was in the bath,

37
00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:43.935
or it fell from her pocket while her
body was being carried to the well.

38
00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:50.015
In either case, she likely planned
to burn the tape in the stove.

39
00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:55.695
The murder probably
happened in the bathroom.

40
00:02:55.695 --> 00:03:00.995
That way, if any blood went flying,
it could be cleaned away.

41
00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:06.045
So, who is this person who
killed her first in the bathroom?!

42
00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:12.045
Machiko-san's target was someone
fond of taking a bath every day,

43
00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:16.055
and the only person here whose
turn to use it was set in stone.

44
00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:20.345
It was you, Yabuuchi Yoshifusa-san!

45
00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:24.645
U-Uncle?! That can't be!

46
00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:28.855
As I recall, Brazilian jujutsu
has a certain technique...

47
00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.025
in which you twist the arm
of a knife-wielding attacker

48
00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:34.865
and cause the attacker to stab himself.

49
00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:40.615
When Machiko-san attacked,
you used that move without thinking!

50
00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:45.955
Increasing her share of the
inheritance was probably her motive.

51
00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:51.965
B-But that would be self-defense.
Why would he keep quiet about it?

52
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:58.135
Because he had been
sent two threatening letters.

53
00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:02.515
So, there's still another
cretin out to take my life.

54
00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:07.065
That clearly indicates
someone had attacked him before.

55
00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:11.135
In short, Machiko-san
had also sent a threat letter.

56
00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.405
Just like Keiko-san,
who had set up the arrow.

57
00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:18.725
I assume he tied the body to the
well rope and made it easy to spot

58
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:22.135
to serve as an example to
the other intimidator.

59
00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:26.265
In any case, it was
self-defense, plain and simple.

60
00:04:28.345 --> 00:04:31.375
Will you confess, Yoshifusa-san?!

61
00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:34.685
You still have room for improvement.

62
00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.685
Hey! Who're you?!

63
00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:45.225
The man with the sunglasses!

64
00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:46.645
What?!

65
00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:51.605
The tape with the will on it.
One listen will shed light on everything.

66
00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:53.265
Hurry.

67
00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:54.655
R-Right...

68
00:04:56.155 --> 00:05:01.475
I divide my inheritance between
the following six people:

69
00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:06.555
my wife Machiko, my daughter
Hiromi, her husband Hidekazu,

70
00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:09.805
my son Yoshiyuki, his wife Keiko,

71
00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:12.585
and Carlos.

72
00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:17.675
C-Carlos?! W-What is
his name doing on here?!

73
00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:23.135
I hereby divide my inheritance
evenly among those six people.

74
00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:27.555
That's strange! Why isn't
your name on the list, Uncle?!

75
00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:30.065
Of course it isn't.

76
00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:35.275
After all, that old man is a
bodyguard who came here from Brazil

77
00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:38.325
to keep Carlos safe!

78
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:39.785
What?!

79
00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:42.355
Then, who is Carlos?!

80
00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:49.705
The son born of the real
Yoshifusa-san and a Brazilian woman.

81
00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:51.335
S-Son?

82
00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:55.335
But, Detective!
Where did you find that out?!

83
00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:57.845
No, I'm not a detective.

84
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.305
I'm just a mere mystery writer.

85
00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:04.095
Y-Yusaku-san!

86
00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:07.055
Yikes! D-Dad!

87
00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:09.725
Yusaku-san!
What are you doing here?

88
00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:11.975
Oh, uhh, you know.

89
00:06:12.975 --> 00:06:16.555
But is he really not him?!

90
00:06:16.555 --> 00:06:19.445
He's left-handed,
and his handwriting matched!

91
00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:23.265
The world is full of left-handed people.

92
00:06:23.265 --> 00:06:25.265
It's only natural the handwriting matches.

93
00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:29.415
Because Mr. Yoshifusa
had the old man write for him.

94
00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:35.805
Mr. Yoshifusa and the old man
owned a farm in Brazil together.

95
00:06:36.885 --> 00:06:41.555
But when a tornado hit ten years ago,
the old man hurt his right leg

96
00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:45.225
and Mr. Yoshifusa lost his left arm.

97
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:50.395
Ever since, the old man wrote for him.

98
00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:54.555
Carlos was given part of the inheritance

99
00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:58.805
because Mr. Yoshichika felt sorry
for his brother who lost his farm

100
00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:01.895
and had died of illness half a year prior.

101
00:07:03.475 --> 00:07:05.945
It was all written in here,

102
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:09.935
in this pile of letters left in
a hidden panel in the storeroom.

103
00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:13.885
But why did you
pretend to be our uncle?

104
00:07:13.885 --> 00:07:15.795
Don't tell me it was to pilfer money!

105
00:07:15.795 --> 00:07:19.975
If that was his intent,
he wouldn't have taken on the role

106
00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:21.795
of someone whose life was threatened.

107
00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.185
If people learned
Carlos was Mr. Yoshifusa's son,

108
00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:28.095
he would've been
targeted by the intimidators.

109
00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:31.805
That's why the old man
took on the role of Mr. Yoshifusa.

110
00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:36.775
To have the intimidators'
attacks focused on him instead.

111
00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:40.015
This is evidenced by the fact
that when the old man would bathe,

112
00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:41.775
he would leave Carlos
in the other room.

113
00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:45.725
Because making it seem like
he was keeping watch over everyone

114
00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:47.825
would be the safest idea.

115
00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:50.765
The old man planned to
catch the intimidator,

116
00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:53.305
but wound up killing her instead.

117
00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:55.725
Although it was a case of self-defense,

118
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:59.335
he would've been taken
away by the police for questioning.

119
00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:04.805
But he couldn't leave Carlos alone
with one other intimidator around.

120
00:08:04.805 --> 00:08:09.135
He made the body easy to find to
see if the police detective who came

121
00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:12.305
was a sensible man or not.

122
00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:16.225
But what came was
an unreliable rookie detective.

123
00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:17.595
With no other choice,

124
00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:21.905
the old man decided to remain
silent until the will was read.

125
00:08:22.845 --> 00:08:24.555
I see...

126
00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:27.635
Did I get anything wrong,

127
00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.365
Hickson Tanaka-san, 2nd-generation
Japanese-Brazilian?!

128
00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:36.085
You're exactly right.
You didn't get a single thing wrong.

129
00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:37.975
If you'll present yourself to the police,

130
00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:42.085
I can introduce you to a great,
hardhearted inspector I know.

131
00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:46.755
Yes, that would be best.
I think I can trust you!

132
00:08:50.805 --> 00:08:53.225
Inspector Megure arrived two hours later,

133
00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:57.335
and Tanaka-san and Keiko-san were
taken to the Gunma Police Dept.

134
00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:04.805
Carlos, who knew very little Japanese,
watched sadly as the car left,

135
00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:09.845
but Dad told him in Portuguese
that he would be back very soon,

136
00:09:09.845 --> 00:09:12.095
at which he showed child-like joy.

137
00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:17.515
Apparently, in order to keep Carlos safe,

138
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.055
Tanaka-san hadn't told
him about the inheritance

139
00:09:20.055 --> 00:09:23.645
or that this was his
father's family's home.

140
00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:28.405
And then, the long night ended.

141
00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:33.765
Eh?! You heard my voice?!

142
00:09:34.135 --> 00:09:36.725
Yeah. Dr. Agasa gave me a microphone

143
00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:40.015
that picks up sounds from your bowtie.

144
00:09:40.015 --> 00:09:42.525
It helped with my deduction.

145
00:09:43.385 --> 00:09:46.475
I would've known the
old man wasn't the real deal

146
00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:48.525
if I'd found those letters, too.

147
00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:53.885
No, I knew he was a
fake before reading the letters.

148
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:54.785
How?!

149
00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:57.055
His leg scar.

150
00:09:57.055 --> 00:10:00.515
A left-handed first baseman
would stretch out from the left leg.

151
00:10:00.515 --> 00:10:03.295
But that old man's
scar was on his right leg.

152
00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:09.305
It seemed strange, so I scoured
the storeroom and found the letters.

153
00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:14.305
It seems you still lack in the
observation department, Shinichi-kun!

154
00:10:14.595 --> 00:10:16.475
You think you're so great.

155
00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:19.765
Look at you trying to act cool,
after chasing after me.

156
00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:24.135
"I'm just a mere mystery writer."
You gotta be kidding me!

157
00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:26.805
Are you trying to be
Akechi Kogoro or something?

158
00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:30.295
Talk about lame! I can't believe you!

159
00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:31.235
Yukiko.

160
00:10:34.265 --> 00:10:35.205
We leave.

161
00:10:37.885 --> 00:10:40.125
Whatever. You don't care how others feel.

162
00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:43.015
"We leave"? Don't insult me!

163
00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:50.045
What're you doing, Shinichi?
You'll get left behind!

164
00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:51.665
O-Oh, yeah.

165
00:10:52.975 --> 00:10:58.625
In any event, these incidents
and this marital spat are over now.

166
00:11:08.885 --> 00:11:16.305
How did they meet

167
00:11:16.305 --> 00:11:25.135
looking at such a lonely sunset?

168
00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:32.475
Even as I try to find clever words,

169
00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:41.265
there are none to
connect our distant hearts

170
00:11:41.265 --> 00:11:49.635
Do you think if
I wave with my best smile

171
00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:59.995
that I might look
even a little prettier?

172
00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:07.975
If I could have one wish granted

173
00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:17.135
it would be that our love
wouldn't make us both hurt

174
00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:26.885
Mori Detective Agency

175
00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:28.205
Bye, Shin-chan!
Mori Detective Agency

176
00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:29.775
Give Ran-kun my regards!

177
00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:34.275
Oh, yes. I'd watch out
for Ran-chan if I were you.

178
00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:39.285
Something bugs me
about that last smile of hers...

179
00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:43.475
Yes. Underestimate women
and you'll be in a world of hurt.

180
00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:45.435
Oh! You do understand!

181
00:12:46.805 --> 00:12:48.335
Later!

182
00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:52.335
She can't be serious... can she?

183
00:12:53.475 --> 00:12:54.845
I'm...

184
00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:57.345
...home?

185
00:12:57.765 --> 00:13:00.345
I heard from Dr. Agasa.

186
00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:02.845
H-Heard what?

187
00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:08.135
If you're going on an overnight
trip somewhere, at least tell us first!

188
00:13:09.095 --> 00:13:10.065
Eh?

189
00:13:12.595 --> 00:13:14.305
I was worried sick!

190
00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:17.635
I kept calling Shinichi's
house but no one was there!

191
00:13:17.635 --> 00:13:19.095
Honestly, now!

192
00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:20.445
I-I'm sorry...

193
00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:25.845
D-Don't scare me like that...
