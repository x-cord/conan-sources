1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,740
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,640
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,940
Awesome stuntman!

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,240
There is a glimpse of a sad incident behind the glamorous scenes.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,840
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,762
Masked Yaiba!

9
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:02,462
You shall not get away!

10
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:16,862
Darn it.

11
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,862
Curses!

12
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:55,262
I won't let him run away!

13
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,662
Yaiba?

14
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,262
Darn it!

15
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:27,962
What?

16
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:45,762
"Extreme Car Stunt"

17
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:50,062
Absolutely! Absolutely no way!

18
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,162
I can't adopt such a plan!

19
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,962
Too dangerous.

20
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:57,462
-I think so, too. -Who's talking to you?

21
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,862
Keep quiet, kid.

22
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:03,662
Sure, it's dangerous. Dangerous for other stuntmen.

23
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:05,662
But I can do it.

24
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,762
I've experienced a stunt like this many times before.

25
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,462
Right, Mr. Kijima?

26
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:13,362
"Daisaku Kijima (40), Cameraman" -Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:14,662
But...

28
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:17,062
Let's do it without a cut, Mr. Kijima.

29
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:18,762
No cheating.

30
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:23,062
Only one cut till I run in here and fall, please.

31
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,962
Besides, your figure of coming out of the car

32
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:29,162
won't be filmed from below. But...

33
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:33,562
Mr. Rikiishi, you are already...

34
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:38,162
To think that we get to see Yaiba on location. Gorgeous, isn't it?

35
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:39,562
Just as expected of you, Dr. Agasa!

36
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,562
He's really a big face!

37
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:43,362
You mean his face is widely known.

38
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:44,362
Look!

39
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,962
They gave me a bunch of Masked Yaiba's seals!

40
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:49,062
And I don't have most of them.

41
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:50,262
Really?

42
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:52,662
What did you say? What do you mean by "already"?

43
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:53,862
Be frank with me.

44
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:54,862
What? What's going on?

45
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,062
-Looks like they're in trouble. -An argument?

46
00:04:57,062 --> 00:05:00,062
As I said, we can now make impressive films freely

47
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,862
using digital technology, more impressive than real stunts.

48
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:04,762
-That's why I said so. -Are you saying that

49
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,562
you don't need antiquated stuntmen like me?

50
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:09,662
No, I am not saying that.

51
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:12,462
A car driven by Masked Yaiba is coming up to the roof.

52
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,462
The Masked Yaiba car stops.

53
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,662
Suppose that his car is A,

54
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:18,362
and the other car is operated with a remote controller.

55
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:20,662
Let's call it B.

56
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:25,462
Replacing Car A driven by Joker, Car B speeds towards the fence.

57
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:32,662
Because the camera is shooting from below, this replacement can't be seen.

58
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:36,962
And digital enhancements will be added to it later.

59
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:41,362
This kind of stunt will be enough for this scene.

60
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:43,762
Darn it.

61
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:56,262
The steering wheel is OK, the brakes are OK.

62
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,462
So, that's the story.

63
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,062
Get it over with quickly.

64
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:01,562
I've gotta make preparations.

65
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,262
Hey, Kijima, you're finished,

66
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:07,062
being at the beck and call of this green-horn.

67
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,862
-What? -Please stop it!

68
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:11,662
This plan is final.

69
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:14,662
I've got the producer's OK, too.

70
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,362
I will go by this!

71
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,962
Thank you very much for understanding!

72
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:23,962
Are you sure?

73
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:26,162
You're going to regret it.

74
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,362
Let go of me!

75
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:30,362
You know, with the swooshes!

76
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:31,962
Yeah, the part with all the flashes!

77
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,262
I love that part.

78
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:37,162
Well, after lunch, I will move to the next cut.

79
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:39,962
Get everything ready and stand by, please!

80
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,662
What a grouch.

81
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:48,862
Masked Yaiba will beat him anyway. Right?

82
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:50,562
It serves him right.

83
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:52,462
Hey...

84
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:55,562
This is just a drama, isn't it?

85
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,962
Heck! I feel awfully unhappy.

86
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:00,962
We've come all the way here and no shooting?

87
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,262
It's lunch time now, so it can't helped, Genta!

88
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,062
Let's have lunch, too.

89
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:10,462
If you say so...

90
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,262
Is there anyone who hasn't received box lunch yet?

91
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:17,562
My stomach's growling.

92
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,062
Come off it, Genta

93
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:22,162
Your stomach reacts quickly.

94
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,462
Here we go!

95
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:24,762
"Masked Yaiba to Ayumi"

96
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:27,562
Are you sure my autograph is what you want?

97
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:30,462
Yes. Thank you very much!

98
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:35,162
Where did Genta and Mitsuhiko go?

99
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:38,962
Splendid! Even the number is the same!

100
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:42,262
These two cars will be exchanged on the roof of the building,

101
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:46,362
and the remote-controlled one will fall over.

102
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:49,262
I'm excited!

103
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:52,662
OK! This is in commemoration of having come here.

104
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:54,762
Oh, no! Genta!

105
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:56,462
Just what do you think you're doing?

106
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:58,062
What's going on, kids?

107
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:01,762
Nothing at all.

108
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,262
-Nothing! -No!

109
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,362
Excuse us.

110
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:21,862
Huh?

111
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,062
I'm counting on you.

112
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,262
Got a sec?

113
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:58,062
You gotta be kidding!

114
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,162
I can't believe you're still meddling!

115
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:03,762
-I'm not meddling! -Those two are arguing again.

116
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,462
I hope they will start shooting the film without a trouble.

117
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,562
I am worried a bit.

118
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,262
Mr. Rikiishi!

119
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:23,262
Huh, did it start?

120
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,962
Please somebody, stop him!

121
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:31,762
He is going to display the plan he was talking about some time ago!

122
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,062
Mr. Rikiishi!

123
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,662
It... it can't be!

124
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,162
That's why...

125
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:19,862
That's why, I told him not to!

126
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:23,462
Whatever is the matter? What happened?

127
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,662
The seat belt is almost unfastened.

128
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:33,262
This means...

129
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:37,462
Just before he broke through that fence on the roof,

130
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,162
he failed to get out of the car.

131
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:42,262
I guess that's how this case will be settled, an accident.

132
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:43,962
What's on your mind?

133
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:52,162
Maybe... this is...

134
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:57,162
Excuse me, Mr. Cameraman!

135
00:10:57,962 --> 00:10:59,862
You were shooting a few minutes ago, weren't you?

136
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,862
Could you show it to me?

137
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:14,262
Just as I thought!

138
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,062
Oops!

139
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:32,162
I must check over there too!

140
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:36,062
Conan!

141
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,562
Where are you going?

142
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,662
He's going to outdo us again!

143
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:41,862
-Let's go too! -Okay!

144
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,162
Hey, you all!

145
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,562
This is...

146
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:03,162
What's up, Conan?

147
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,062
This is not an accident!

148
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:09,462
This is skillfully and carefully schemed murder.

149
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,562
What did you say?

150
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:21,667
The person who has died is Mr. Kengo Rikiishi, a stuntman, 38 years old.

151
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:25,067
Was the cause of death found to be from the fall?

152
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:27,167
Yes. When the car crashed to the ground,

153
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,767
the impact of the fall run through his entire body.

154
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,167
He died on the spot.

155
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,667
But to think that they would make a car fall over

156
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,567
from that height with a person inside,

157
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,967
that's quite a dangerous way to film something.

158
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,267
Wrong!

159
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,767
We would never let anyone do such a stunt.

160
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,967
What do you mean?

161
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:47,067
Well, he... Mr. Rikiishi did it of his own discretion!

162
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:50,567
He did a stunt he wanted to show and failed.

163
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,967
Exactly speaking, it was not a stunt.

164
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,467
It was a performance before the take.

165
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:59,167
I don't understand why did Mr. Rikiishi do such a thing.

166
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,567
He was driven to do so.

167
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,867
-Driven to do so? -Why?

168
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,767
I can understand him, too.

169
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,167
Young people are appearing one after another.

170
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,367
If I had stuck to filming only,

171
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,467
I would have starved to death a long time ago myself.

172
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,267
I am not saying we don't need a stuntman.

173
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,867
We absolutely need stuntmen for this kind of filming.

174
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,367
But, thanks to the development of digital technology,

175
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:22,267
stunts like those done in the past are no longer necessary.

176
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:26,467
But, it is also a fact that there are those who got fired because of this.

177
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,167
I can't do anything about it.

178
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,767
The staff producer's in charge of personnel.

179
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,867
The staff producer wanted to fire him,

180
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,967
but I heard that you stopped him.

181
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,367
Are you sure?

182
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,767
-You're going to regret it. -Let go of me!

183
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,367
I guess he was struggling

184
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,067
to keep the position you helped him from losing,

185
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,167
though it was held together only by a thin strip.

186
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,967
That must have been it.

187
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:51,167
You sound you understand, Mr. Kijima.

188
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,167
But, aren't you the one who attempted a direct appeal to the director,

189
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,567
and made it hard for him to keep his job in the first place?

190
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:59,767
Kengo seemed to know what you did behind the scene.

191
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:04,067
You gotta be kidding! Are you saying I did something to him?

192
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,367
You are the one got beaten by him,

193
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,767
because he nailed you for negligent maintenance, aren't you?

194
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,567
Come off it. No arguing here, please.

195
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:16,367
You often got beaten by him too, didn't you?

196
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:20,167
You would often scream "I'll kill him" at drinking parties.

197
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,167
What? Are you saying I did something more than that?

198
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,367
Officer, this is enough. Please make it clear.

199
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,967
This was an accident, wasn't it? This thing.

200
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,367
Well, let me see.

201
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,267
We'll have to get specialists to investigate and tell us

202
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,867
whether this was caused by negligence in maintenance or not.

203
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,067
Absolutely not!

204
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,667
The maintenance was complete.

205
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,967
But you have a motive.

206
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,867
The same goes for you too!

207
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:44,067
But at this stage,

208
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:47,267
the possibility of this being an accident is high, I would say.

209
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,767
See? Naturally!

210
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,367
Doc, you're on.

211
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,967
Wait!

212
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,767
Well...

213
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,067
This is a murder case, under the pretense of an accident.

214
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,267
What? What did you say?

215
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,467
What proof do you have for saying that?

216
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,667
Calm down. I want to confirm one thing.

217
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:16,067
About the late Mr. Rikiishi's personality.

218
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,567
Personality?

219
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,167
For example, the more dangerous a stunt becomes,

220
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,467
the more he wants to do it.

221
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,867
Yeah, right,

222
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:28,467
he had a tendency since his young days to go out of his way

223
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:29,867
to plunged into danger.

224
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,867
It's an occupational sickness.

225
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:34,667
Before doing so, careful preparation and training

226
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,167
are naturally needed, though.

227
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,767
A person who can do this is first-class.

228
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,067
How was Mr. Rikiishi?

229
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,567
He was first-class.

230
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,367
Yes, when he was young.

231
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:49,267
But, recently he perhaps became careless.

232
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:52,467
Say the murderer took advantage of this?

233
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,767
-What? -Just what do you mean?

234
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,567
Mr. Fukamachi.

235
00:15:56,567 --> 00:16:00,267
What were you talking about with Mr. Rikiishi then?

236
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:03,967
He was saying he would show us a real stunt.

237
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:06,567
He wouldn't listen to me and...

238
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,667
It's the other way around!

239
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:11,667
The other way around?

240
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:17,267
What I am saying is, he was not the one who proposed it, you did.

241
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,167
By saying something like,

242
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,467
"Depending on your performance, they may agree to it,"

243
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,767
"though I would oppose to it in my position,"

244
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,067
and tempted him to do it.

245
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,767
Nonsense!

246
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:32,067
Are you saying that I killed him?

247
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:36,667
Yes, the murderer was you, Mr. Fukamachi.

248
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,167
Doctor Agasa.

249
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,667
He might have attempted to provoke Mr. Rikiishi,

250
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,467
but the one who actually drove the car

251
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:45,167
and failed the stunt was Mr. Rikiishi himself.

252
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,167
This is not a murder case!

253
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:54,267
You are right. For that reason, you furthermore said to Mr. Rikiishi.

254
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:58,367
"No explosives are loaded in Car A for it to explode in mid air."

255
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,467
"So, sitting in Car A to do your stunt is meaningless."

256
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,567
"Don't do it."

257
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:07,067
After being told so, Mr. Rikiishi made up his mind

258
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,467
to quickly change to Car B, which is loaded with explosives

259
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,967
as soon as he arrives at the roof

260
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,267
and flee from the car just before it falls over.

261
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,867
He wanted to do a dangerous stunt

262
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,067
and show everyone how capable he is.

263
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:23,867
What? You mean that's Car B that was on the roof?

264
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,567
No,

265
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:31,467
this is Car A that had no explosives loaded in it!

266
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,567
I'm confused.

267
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:34,967
Me, too.

268
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,067
Wait a second.

269
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,667
I am sure that back then...

270
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,867
Officer Takagi, just in case, check the car on the roof.

271
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:42,867
Yes, sir!

272
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,367
Inspector! I've found it!

273
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,467
This is Car B, as we thought!

274
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,367
In other words, Mr. Rikiishi dared the stunt without changing cars.

275
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:58,667
He failed and fell over.

276
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,167
It was surely an accident.

277
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,867
Don't jump to conclusions.

278
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:06,867
Try recalling Mr. Rikiishi, right after the accident.

279
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,567
If you have any pictures of the site taken by the forensic officer...

280
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,467
-Conan! -Yes.

281
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:20,167
-This is it after all! -This!

282
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,967
The Masked Yaiba sticker that Genta put on the car.

283
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:27,067
He stuck them on the car that the man in charge moved to the roof.

284
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,767
Right, Genta?

285
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,367
Yeah.

286
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,967
No doubt about it.

287
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,767
He did change the cars on the roof!

288
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,067
Sorry.

289
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,767
I put the stickers on both cars.

290
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,467
No.

291
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:46,467
We therefore, can't prove that he changed cars.

292
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:49,967
No, it's not that. Here's what I want you to see!

293
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,867
Hey, Mr. Cameraman.

294
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,467
Could you show us the film you showed me some time ago again?

295
00:18:58,467 --> 00:18:59,567
Stop, please!

296
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,967
See? His cape's not jammed.

297
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,567
What's this?

298
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,967
It doesn't look as if he opened or closed the door

299
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,367
until he got to the roof.

300
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,567
But, the explosive...

301
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,567
All that had to be done was to reload the car beforehand.

302
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,967
But it doesn't prove that he changed cars.

303
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,367
Conan!

304
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,767
I went up to the roof right away,

305
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,067
but, the hood was still hot.

306
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,567
It seemed as if the engine had just been stopped.

307
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,467
Oh, as you say...

308
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,767
Nonsense! So what?

309
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,767
Supposing... just supposing that

310
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:38,267
I had lured him to change cars on the roof,

311
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:42,367
I hate to say this but, he's the one who couldn't make it out of the car

312
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,167
before the car fell over, right?

313
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,367
Are you saying that his ability is no good anymore?

314
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,967
He could've stepped on the brake before he broke through the fence.

315
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,167
He couldn't even do that, which means...

316
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,767
I agree.

317
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,367
No, both getting out of the car and stepping on the brakes

318
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,167
were impossible to begin with.

319
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,467
I don't understand.

320
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,767
Please try to remember

321
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:10,467
what kind of Car B that was prepared on the roof was like.

322
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:14,267
In addition to explosives for a mid air explosion being set up...

323
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,867
A remote controller!

324
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,867
Where is the remote controller now?

325
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,467
That's...

326
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,267
This is it, isn't it?

327
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,267
Yes. He said he wanted to check it, so I lent it to him.

328
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:33,767
By using it, we can find out which car is A and which car is B.

329
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,867
What is this?

330
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,067
It seems to be crying.

331
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,467
Yes, it does.

332
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,367
Poor thing.

333
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:59,767
I had debts, so I used the production money.

334
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:03,067
He found out about it and blackmailed me.

335
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,067
That's why you took advantage of Mr. Rikiishi's mental tendency

336
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,567
and planned the murder.

337
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,267
Car A driven by Rikiishi reached the roof parking lot.

338
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,867
You used the remote controller at just about the time

339
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,667
he was to transfer to Car B.

340
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:24,767
The brake didn't work and the door didn't open.

341
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,667
The car fell over.

342
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,267
And afterwards, Mr. Rikiishi's death would be deemed an accident

343
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,467
he caused himself.

344
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:39,767
So long as everyone thought that he died in Car A,

345
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:42,267
all he had to do is return the remote controller

346
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,067
and act as if nothing had happened.

347
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,867
Isn't that what you thought?

348
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,367
I can't eat anymore.

349
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,067
Masked Yaiba, you look great.

350
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:33,167
You can't stick the sticker all over on there, Genta.

351
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,567
My deduction's gone down the drain.

352
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:37,867
I agree with him.

353
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:50,567
"Next Episode"

354
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,867
Did Mr. Yamamoto commit suicide?

355
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,667
There's something more.

356
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,567
Something that I haven't realized yet.

357
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,867
What is it?
