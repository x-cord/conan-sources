1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,640
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,540
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,040
A surprising incident occurs at the interview site.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,640
The Youth Detective Squad fight as one.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,340
Their deductions surpass those of the police!

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,109
Popular freelance writer, Mr. Masato Sugimori,

10
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:02,009
comes to Teitan Elementary School wanting to interview the activities

11
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,609
of the Youth Detective Squad.

12
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:08,209
Some days later, we go with Ms. Kobayashi

13
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,209
to Mr. Sugimori's residence.

14
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,209
However, we found Mr. Sugimori's dead body there.

15
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,209
As a result of site investigation,

16
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,409
I deduce that the suspect is among the four who left messages

17
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,109
in the answer phone.

18
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:30,209
"The Youth Detective Squad is Interviewed (Part 2)"

19
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,109
Inspector, the recording device has arrived.

20
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,609
Is that right?

21
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,709
Okay, let's hear the first message.

22
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,909
It's the sound of the railroad crossing nearby.

23
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,209
It's so long.

24
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,209
It's already more than two minutes since it's started ringing.

25
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,009
-It... -It stopped.

26
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,509
Let's hear the first one.

27
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,009
There are four messages.

28
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,009
Mr. Sugimori?

29
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,709
This is Haruka.

30
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,709
I seem to have drunk too much last night.

31
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,809
-I'm sorry. -There seems to be...

32
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,809
-I'm not angry anymore. -a lot of pollen in the air.

33
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:19,509
-I thought you were seeing someone else -How do you deal with hay fever?

34
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,809
-because you never take me to your room. -The information we'll provide...

35
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:26,209
-Call me if you receive my message. -for April 22nd is pollen allergy!

36
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,309
Received on Friday, 11:25.

37
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,909
Inspector, there's a sound of the television in the background.

38
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:39,109
Yeah. This is the program playing from 11:00 on Nichiuri TV, "Meippai TV".

39
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,009
April 22nd is yesterday,

40
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:43,309
so we can call the television station

41
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:46,109
and confirm what time they aired the program.

42
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,709
This is Higaki.

43
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,309
-I'm heading over to your place... -The next station is Okuho. Okuho.

44
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:55,209
-because I want to apologize to you in person. -Please watch...

45
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,609
If you're not home, I'll go another day.

46
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,109
I'm really sorry about the car.

47
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,709
Later.

48
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,709
Received on Friday, 11:27.

49
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,709
The sound in the background is the announcement inside a train.

50
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,609
Okuho Station is quite some distance from here,

51
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,309
so it'll take him a little over 30 minutes to get here.

52
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,609
This is Inaba from Koeikan.

53
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,509
I wanted to ask you about your progress on the article we requested.

54
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,709
Chief, what's today's date?

55
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,609
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

56
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:33,509
The deadline is a week from now, so please keep up your good work.

57
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,509
-Chief, are you watching the game tonight? -If this is about the scoop,

58
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,509
I'm not upset about it anymore.

59
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,409
-Don't worry. It'll be held at Tohto Dome. -Continue work for us as always.

60
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,709
Received on Friday, 11:29.

61
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,709
This time it's the voices of other people.

62
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,209
It seems he called from his work place.

63
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,309
The chief and another person

64
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:52,009
seem to have been there other than the caller.

65
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,909
Isn't Koeikan some distance away from here, too?

66
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,009
Yes.

67
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,909
If by train, you've got to transfer. It'll take an hour even by car.

68
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,309
Now for the last message.

69
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,809
I'm the one who called you a while ago,

70
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:10,209
the homeroom teacher for first grade, Class B, Kobayashi.

71
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,809
I'm sorry. It seems I have hay fever.

72
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,809
I have something I'd like to ask you.

73
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,809
I'll ask you when we go over to see you tomorrow.

74
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,609
I'll see you tomorrow.

75
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:27,109
Received on Friday, 11:30.

76
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,709
This is your voice, right, Ms. Kobayashi?

77
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:32,009
Yes.

78
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,709
Which means that Ms. Kobayashi is the killer!

79
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,609
-What? -No, hardly.

80
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:39,509
Because if Ms. Kobayashi were the killer,

81
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,209
she would've forced her way inside the room and run over to the body.

82
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,009
That way, when the police investigate later,

83
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,809
she could mislead them, even if they found her hair or her fingerprints.

84
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:55,009
-Hey, hold back a bit, will you? -Sorry.

85
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,409
By the way, what is this thing you wanted to ask about

86
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,509
that you mentioned in your message?

87
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,409
Right. It's about the interview of the children.

88
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:07,609
There's no mistake that you left your message at 11:30 yesterday?

89
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:12,009
Yes. You can also hear the bell ringing for the start of 4th period.

90
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,209
Yesterday, at around 11:22 right after 3rd period,

91
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,509
I called Mr. Sugimori to tell him

92
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,109
that the children have accepted to do the interview.

93
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:22,509
I remembered that I had a question and called him,

94
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,609
but his phone was already on answer phone at that time.

95
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:32,209
Then the crime was committed within 30 minutes from 11:22.

96
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,609
But, inspector,

97
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,509
according to Ms. Kobayashi, since the time on this phone is accurate,

98
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,309
it occurred in the three minutes between 11:22

99
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,809
and when the first message was left in the machine at 11:25.

100
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,809
Three minutes. What a piece of work.

101
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,509
True.

102
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,509
Come to think of it,

103
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,809
when I called him telling him that we'd accept the interview,

104
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,009
he mentioned that he was expecting someone to come soon.

105
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,309
Did you get the name?

106
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:57,309
No.

107
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,809
Police?

108
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:02,309
I already paid for my parking ticket.

109
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:05,909
No. It's actually about Mr. Sugimori.

110
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:09,209
Did you leave a message in his answer phone yesterday afternoon?

111
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,809
"Haruka Aida (29)" -Yes.

112
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:15,009
I got wasted last night and seemed to have picked on him a lot.

113
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,309
Do you remember where you called him from?

114
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,909
I called from my condo on my cell phone.

115
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,009
Is there anyone who can verify this?

116
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,209
No. But what is this all about?

117
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,509
Well, we'll give you the details later.

118
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,009
We'll send a car to pick you up, so could I have your address, please?

119
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,209
Yes. Gizencho I-chome...

120
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,009
Gizencho?

121
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,509
That sure is a place far from here.

122
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:41,609
What? Did I call Sugimori?

123
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:44,309
"Toshinori Higaki (33)" -Yeah. I did yesterday

124
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,009
from inside the Tohto Kanjo Line train.

125
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,709
But I only got the answer phone.

126
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,109
Were you with someone at that time?

127
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,809
No, I was alone.

128
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:56,809
Don't tell me that he went crying to the police

129
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,309
about the scratch on the bumper of his Ferrari?

130
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:02,809
I slightly bumped into a telephone pole when I borrowed the car from him.

131
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:04,909
He was pissed though.

132
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,009
I'm sorry, Inaba just stepped out.

133
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,509
I think he'll be back soon though.

134
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,109
Yes. I'm the editor-in-chief, Hayashi.

135
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,309
What do you police want with him?

136
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:19,709
Do you know where he was at about 11:30 yesterday?

137
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,709
No. Editors go in and out a lot.

138
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,309
He left a message in a certain person's answer phone

139
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,709
and we hear your voice in the background saying,

140
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,209
"It's April 22nd, 11:28."

141
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,209
Then I'm sure he was here in the editing room.

142
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,309
His cell phone isn't working well,

143
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,509
so he usually asks me for the date and time.

144
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,509
I've been telling him for the past year to hurry and buy a new one, but...

145
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:48,209
Chief, you're going to the ball game tonight, aren't you?

146
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,409
Is it going to be okay?

147
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,209
I'm worried because it's not going to be at the Tohto Dome tonight.

148
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,509
It's not about the game, but how're you feeling?

149
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,609
I slept all night and got over my cold right away.

150
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,609
My eyes aren't blood shot anymore either.

151
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:03,009
I must've been tired.

152
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,209
Inaba, there was a call from the police for you!

153
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,909
"Atsushi Inaba (32)" -The police?

154
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,209
I wonder what is it for?

155
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,209
Mr. Inaba, please wait at the editing room,

156
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,109
-until we go and pick you up. -Don't you think it's strange?

157
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:16,409
I agree.

158
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:17,609
What seems to be the matter?

159
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:19,509
The 2nd message in the phone.

160
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,709
Something's strange about the announcement in the train.

161
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,709
They usually say, "Please watch your footsteps when disembarking."

162
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,109
-Because I want to apologize to you in person. -Please watch...

163
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,109
If you're not home,

164
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:32,809
-It's true that it's stopped at "Please watch..." -I'll go another day.

165
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,509
Let's call and confirm just to be sure.

166
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,609
What? The conductor that did the announcement

167
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:40,309
had hay fever?

168
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:43,709
Yes. That was me.

169
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,709
I came down with hay fever all of a sudden yesterday

170
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,009
that I couldn't hold up till the Tohto Kanjo Line made its round.

171
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:53,009
I had someone else take my place after noon time.

172
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,109
Is that right?

173
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:57,209
It seems that he stopped at "Please watch..."

174
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,909
because he was holding back sneezing.

175
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,809
I see.

176
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,809
I confirmed with my wife as to the 1st message where "Meippai TV"

177
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,609
was aired in the background,

178
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:11,609
and was told that hay fever information really started at around 11:25.

179
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:15,109
Which means they both seem to have an alibi.

180
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,309
No.

181
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,709
There's only one person who has a solid alibi.

182
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,409
The sound of the railroad crossing again?

183
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,809
Come to think of it,

184
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,209
that is also the tracks where the Tohto Kanjo Line passes.

185
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,509
It takes an hour for the Tohto Kanjo Line to make one round.

186
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,809
And on weekdays,

187
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:38,209
I think the departure and arrival times are the same.

188
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:39,909
Well, for the time being,

189
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,609
let's hear what the three who left those messages have to say.

190
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,709
-Yes. I'll go pick them up then. -No.

191
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:47,709
I think there's only one person...

192
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,809
you need to bring here.

193
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,456
What? Just one?

194
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,656
Yes.

195
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:03,056
After killing Mr. Sugimori, the killer

196
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,656
deliberately set the telephone in this room to answer phone

197
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:08,956
in order to leave his message inside to establish an alibi, right?

198
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:11,056
So from those three messages,

199
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:14,856
and the calls Officer Takagi just made to the three who left them,

200
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:18,456
can't you tell who's suspicious, and who's not?

201
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,256
The hint is hay fever.

202
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:26,756
Right.

203
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:30,456
Ms. Kobayashi is suspicious of me.

204
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,756
But I may be wrong because after all, I'm just a kid.

205
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:35,356
Hay fever?

206
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:39,056
Come to think of it, all of them had something to do with hay fever.

207
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:40,956
They're not listening to me.

208
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:44,856
At 11:25, in the background of Haruka's message,

209
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:48,156
the sound of the hay fever information program was heard.

210
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:51,256
At 11:27, in Mr. Higaki's message,

211
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:55,356
the strange announcement from within the train was heard.

212
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:58,156
The man who made the announcement had hay fever,

213
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,056
and due to him needing to try not to sneeze,

214
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:03,756
someone else had to take his place.

215
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,256
Although Mr. Inaba's message was left in the machine at 11:29,

216
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,056
when asked about what date and time it was...

217
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:13,656
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

218
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:16,856
There was only the voice of the editor-in-chief answering as such.

219
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,656
But he says nothing about pollen allergy.

220
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,156
True.

221
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:25,856
Hey. When Officer Takagi called the editor-in-chief just now, didn't he say

222
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,756
that he slept all night, his cold got better

223
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:30,956
and his blood shot eyes also improved?

224
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:33,256
You experienced the same thing too, didn't you, Ms. Kobayashi?

225
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,756
Yes.

226
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,456
But mine wasn't a cold, it was hay fever.

227
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,156
Hey.

228
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:45,256
That editor had hay fever.

229
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:48,756
What does that have to do with this case?

230
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:51,356
Maybe we'd better call everyone here after all, don't you think?

231
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:52,656
A little more than an hour!

232
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:56,056
-No! It's exactly an hour! -What?

233
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,956
-What's up, you two? -What is it?

234
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:02,056
It's the time it takes for the Tohto Kanjo Line to go once around.

235
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,456
That's what the two are arguing about.

236
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,456
When I took that train before with mom on our way home,

237
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,256
we both fell asleep on the train.

238
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,156
It was too bothersome to transfer,

239
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,456
so we stayed on the train and went once around.

240
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:16,556
But we got home a little after an hour.

241
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:20,556
But I'm sure that according to the timetable, it was an hour.

242
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:23,056
Although the inbound and outbound trains are slightly different,

243
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,956
both are approximately about an hour.

244
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:25,956
Come to think of it,

245
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:29,856
from here to Okuho Station where the man who made the announcement at,

246
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:31,756
it would take at least 30 minutes

247
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,156
regardless of whether it's inward or outward bound, right?

248
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,356
Yeah.

249
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,156
Because Okuho is located right opposite here.

250
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,656
If that man got off the train a little after noon

251
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:42,556
before the train made its round,

252
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,756
he would've got on the train after 11:00 in the morning at the earliest.

253
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,156
Right.

254
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:48,556
-So? -So?

255
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:51,656
Hey, Ayumi.

256
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,056
I see.

257
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,056
Hey.

258
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:58,556
Maybe Mr. Higaki who said he called from inside the train

259
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:03,956
recorded that announcement and played it while talking on the phone?

260
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,256
I see.

261
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:08,756
If so, it would sound as if he did in fact call from inside the train.

262
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:10,956
I don't think so.

263
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:15,256
The station employee said he suddenly came down with hay fever yesterday.

264
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,856
If the station employee got on the train after 11:00,

265
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,756
Mr. Higaki could've recorded the announcement

266
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,356
only from around the same time.

267
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:24,656
Mr. Higaki's call is at 11:27.

268
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,656
If he was close to Okuho Station, which is over 30 minutes away from here,

269
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:31,056
leaving a message of the train announcement is...

270
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:35,956
To come here and push the answer phone button after killing Mr. Sugimori

271
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:38,556
is impossible. Mr. Higaki isn't a suspect.

272
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,956
Right.

273
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,156
But...

274
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:42,656
Hold it, Genta.

275
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:43,656
Not yet.

276
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:46,956
Okay. Go ahead.

277
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:51,456
But the sound of the television that was heard in Haruka's message

278
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:54,256
can easily be left from inside this room, right?

279
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:56,156
-Okay! -I get it!

280
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,856
That television was used.

281
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,156
If she turned the answering machine on after killing him

282
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:04,256
and called here while the television was playing in the background...

283
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:07,656
It would sound as if the caller were calling from a different place.

284
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,956
Which makes Haruka a suspect.

285
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:13,556
What's that? People are making a fuss outside.

286
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:15,556
True.

287
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,356
Hurry up and cross.

288
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,856
Is it going to be long again?

289
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,656
Maybe this is...

290
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,456
The railroad crossing?

291
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,456
Come to think of it,

292
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,656
it was ringing before we listened to the answer phone a while ago, too.

293
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,356
This railroad crossing seems to be closed

294
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:30,956
for more than two minutes.

295
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:34,256
I checked the timetable a while ago with my cell phone

296
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:39,056
and it seems that a train also passes here at around 11:24.

297
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:44,556
Haruka's message was left in the answer phone at 11:25.

298
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:46,656
According to Ms. Kobayashi's testimony,

299
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:50,356
the estimated time of crime committed is between 11:22 to 11:25,

300
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:51,756
which is only three minutes.

301
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:53,156
If it's Haruka,

302
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:55,256
she would've had to come here and hit Mr. Sugimori

303
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:57,256
with the camera tripod when he is off his guard and kill him.

304
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,756
Pushing the answering machine's on button

305
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:02,756
and leaving the room would use up almost all that time.

306
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:04,656
It's just as Conan and the others said.

307
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:08,456
She left the message with the sound of the television in the back.

308
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:11,056
It's impossible unless she did it from this room or somewhere around here.

309
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:15,156
But the sound of the railroad crossing is not heard.

310
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,856
Which means she left the message

311
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,856
from somewhere quite a distance from here.

312
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:22,556
It's impossible for Haruka to commit the crime.

313
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:25,156
So the only one left is Mr. Inaba.

314
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,956
Right, Conan?

315
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:28,856
I think so.

316
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,456
What? Mr. Sugimori?

317
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:39,256
The estimated time the crime was committed is between 11:22 and 11:25.

318
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:41,256
Where were you during that time?

319
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,156
I was here in the editing room.

320
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,856
You heard the message that I left in the answer phone, didn't you?

321
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:48,156
This is Inaba from Koeikan.

322
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:51,156
I wanted to ask you about your progress on the article we requested.

323
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,556
Chief, what's today's date?

324
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:57,556
It's April 22nd, 11:28.

325
00:16:57,556 --> 00:17:00,256
See? The voice of the editor is in it, too.

326
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:01,856
So there's no mistake about it, is there?

327
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,756
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

328
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,256
Ouch.

329
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,056
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

330
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,856
My stomach hurts!

331
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:14,556
It could be the mini cup milk that I put inside my tea this morning.

332
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:17,756
The bag that had the freshness expiration on the bag was torn,

333
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:19,756
and I saw the month April written on it

334
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:21,656
but I couldn't read the rest of it.

335
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,356
You see, two or three days wouldn't be a problem,

336
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:26,056
but if the expiry date was something like a year ago,

337
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,256
it would really be a problem.

338
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,156
A year ago?

339
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,456
Hey.

340
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,856
I think this is a role that you should play after all, Genta.

341
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:35,156
I get it! A year ago!

342
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,656
That message that was left behind

343
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,956
could've been left on April 22nd a year ago.

344
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:44,156
The editor doesn't mention April 22nd of what year.

345
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:47,656
Moreover, Mr. Inaba doesn't say which article he's referring to either.

346
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:48,856
I see.

347
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,456
Which means he left something that was recorded a year ago

348
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:55,556
inside the answer phone a year later which is yesterday,

349
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:56,956
after he committed the crime to establish an alibi.

350
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,456
Hey.

351
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,556
How can you say that?

352
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:03,256
I really phoned from the company yesterday.

353
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,456
Ms. Kobayashi, I bet you don't feel like going out much

354
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:08,956
-during hay fever season, right? -No.

355
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:12,256
Come to think of it, the editor also had a bad case of hay fever, right?

356
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:16,356
He kept repeating that he had a cold yesterday though.

357
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:18,356
If he in fact did have a cold,

358
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,856
the more he wouldn't say the following, would he?

359
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:24,056
"Chief, are you watching the game tonight?"

360
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:26,856
"Don't worry. It'll be held at Tohto Dome."

361
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,156
He sounds like he's really set on going to the game.

362
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:32,756
The editor is a fervent baseball fan,

363
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:35,156
so he'll go even if he has a cold.

364
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,856
I don't know whether he went yesterday or not though.

365
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:43,356
But when Officer Takagi first talked to the editor on the phone, he said,

366
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,556
"I'm worried because it's not going to be at the Tohto Dome tonight."

367
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,256
Maybe the editor made a mistake.

368
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:52,056
Then, I wonder if he was worried about the weather?

369
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,456
Yeah.

370
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,856
With a weather like today,

371
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:57,756
the game could be cancelled if there's no roof, right?

372
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:59,056
Then what about the...

373
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,556
"Don't worry because it's going to be held at Tohto Dome today."

374
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:04,356
I think he's referring to the weather.

375
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:08,356
But it was sunshiny all day yesterday.

376
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:12,156
I see.

377
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:15,556
It was raining on April 22nd a year ago

378
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:18,256
and there wasn't much pollen in the air, too.

379
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,256
No, that's...

380
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:22,356
That's just plain deduction.

381
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,956
There was no sound of rain in the message.

382
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,456
Besides, do you have proof that I did it or something?

383
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:30,856
Hey, your motorbike outside is really dirty,

384
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,456
but don't you wash it often?

385
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:33,956
What?

386
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,256
Your boots are all scratched up and worn out,

387
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,656
so why didn't you go buy a new one together with it?

388
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,756
Together?

389
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:43,156
Because you just bought a new pair of gloves, right?

390
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,756
The price tag is still on it.

391
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:46,956
I see!

392
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:48,356
The gloves that you usually wear

393
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,356
are the ones that you had on when you committed the crime.

394
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,856
And you noticed blood on them, so you bought new ones.

395
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:56,056
Moreover, since the price tag is still on them,

396
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,956
you must've realized it on your way here.

397
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,456
Let's check for blood reaction on the places

398
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:04,556
that you may have touched then.

399
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:08,956
Let's start from the handle of you motorbike that you said you didn't wash.

400
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,756
Just as expected, Mr. Sugimori's blood

401
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:16,256
was found on the motorbike handle.

402
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,656
His motive for killing

403
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:20,456
was the exposure article that was left in the answer phone.

404
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,156
Both men had spent three years investigating

405
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:24,756
the embezzlement case of a big political figure.

406
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,956
But Sugimori sold it to another magazine

407
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:30,156
that offered a higher price for it.

408
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:34,456
Mr. Inaba insisted while sobbing and trembling that more than the money,

409
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:37,056
he wanted his magazine to be the first to publicize it.

410
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:39,956
It turns out that the story about interviewing the Youth Detective Squad

411
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:42,556
was just a trick to make his story seem coherent.

412
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,456
I'm sort of pooped.

413
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,456
I did so much talking.

414
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,956
I was so nervous.

415
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,456
If you were to hide a leaf, the best place to do so is in the forest.

416
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:53,756
So you divide the dialogue among the other kids

417
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:56,356
and distract her attention from you.

418
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,456
Sort of.

419
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,956
Now, if Ms. Kobayashi...

420
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,956
Hey, kids.

421
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,256
I'd like to ask you all something.

422
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,256
Here she comes.

423
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:10,556
Do you know Ranpo Edogawa?

424
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:11,656
Yes.

425
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:15,156
The one that Kogoro Akechi and 20 masks come out, right?

426
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:16,156
That's right.

427
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:20,356
You're just like the Youth Detective Squad that comes out in the series.

428
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,056
I'm a great fan of the series.

429
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:24,656
So I'd like to ask you a favour.

430
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:25,756
What favour?

431
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:28,556
You want to tell us to stay away from danger or something like that, right?

432
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:32,156
We'll be just fine because we think before we act.

433
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:37,456
Nope. I'd like to join your Detective Squad.

434
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:38,456
Would that be possible?

435
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,756
Adults can't join.

436
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,656
Please keep your age in mind.

437
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:46,456
But my name is Kobayashi, you know.

438
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:48,056
There's no reason why I can't join, is there?

439
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,556
It seems everything's okay now.

440
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,156
True.

441
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,856
An interview again...

442
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:22,456
Yes. And of course,

443
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:24,956
I'll be going with you as the advisor of the Youth Detective Squad

444
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:26,756
so no need to worry.

445
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,356
When did she become our advisor?

446
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:31,756
And the person who's going to interview you is the famous...

447
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:33,656
I've had enough with interviews.

448
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,656
I know I'm going to be pooped.

449
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:38,756
Is that so?

450
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:41,656
That's the story, so I'm very sorry.

451
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:45,256
No, don't be. I'm sorry to have troubled you.

452
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:49,556
I figured that Conan would take on the interview, but...

453
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:52,656
It's amazing that he'd knock off your golden special.

454
00:23:52,656 --> 00:23:55,556
His homeroom teacher is probably one of a hard head.

455
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:07,756
"Next Episode"

456
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:09,556
Is it about some investigation?

457
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,156
Darn!

458
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:23,656
You have to make it, please!

459
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:29,756
Next Conan, "Aya Ueto and Shinichi, The Promise from 4 Years Ago"

460
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,941
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:35,041
"TV drama"

462
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,541
This year's movie is fantastic!

463
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,741
Yeah, it's fantastic!

464
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,641
What? Did you see it already?
