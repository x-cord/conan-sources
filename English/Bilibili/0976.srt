1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,090
Birinmon Fish Market

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,490
What?
Birinmon Fish Market

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,540
The great detective Mori Kogoro?

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,500
Tuna Wholesaler (40)
Employed at Birinmon Fish Market
The great detective Mori Kogoro?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,250
Y-Yes...

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,250
So, what does the great
detective want with us?

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,510
This is the missing pet Armadillo-kun.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,510
She's the pet of a Ginza barmaid
who lives in Haido City.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,480
Great detective Mori Kogoro-sensei.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:39,830
Ginza Barmaid (33)
Haido City Resident

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,070
I'd like you to find my Armadillo-kun.
Ginza Barmaid (33)
Haido City Resident

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,720
I'd like you to find my Armadillo-kun.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,880
This is a picture of him.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,410
An a-armadillo?

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,370
Yes.

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,980
While on my way home yesterday,

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,620
he went missing around the Birinmon Bridge.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,630
I see. Birinmon Bridge.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,810
It must be the Birinmon
Fish Market in that area.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,560
That fish market may have already
prepared my armadillo for consumption...

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,310
Please, Mori-sensei!

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,310
Please find my armadillo!

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,360
Please!

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,140
That's the situation.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,320
I see.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,700
The Birinmon Fish Market...

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,700
What?

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,450
...prepares armadillos for consumption?

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,710
We're a tuna wholesaler.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,810
I certainly don't believe
that's the case either.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,170
Don't ever come back here!

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,550
A fish market doesn't handle armadillos!

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,180
This is a fish market!

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,230
Armadillos aren't fish!

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,610
We don't sell those!

36
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,370
I guess we should head home.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,840
Yeah.

38
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,160
Oof.

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,070
Beika City, please.

40
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,620
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,470
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,220
You won't find armadillos at the market!

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,300
A mysterious taxi appears during the search!

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,870
Always determining the one truth

45
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,550
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,990
his name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,468
Follow Them! Detective Taxi

48
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:37,188
"Follow Them! Detective Taxi!"
Follow Them! Detective Taxi

49
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,968
Follow Them! Detective Taxi

50
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:52,608
Anyway, where could her pet
Armadillo-kun have gone?

51
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:57,438
You're the great detective
Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

52
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:01,568
Indeed. I am Mori Kogoro.

53
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:02,118
I'm a huge fan!

54
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,988
Taxi Driver (25)
I'm a huge fan!

55
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:05,118
Taxi Driver (25)

56
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,538
Marry me!

57
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:07,858
Wh-What?!

58
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,288
Driver, the wheel! The wheel!

59
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:20,498
I'm sorry. I was just so excited.

60
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,848
I can't believe I asked you to marry me.

61
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:26,178
Don't get the wrong idea.

62
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:28,058
I'm just that big of a fan.

63
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,018
Face forward!

64
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:29,848
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:33,038
You're such a huge fan you want to marry me.

66
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,178
Are you happy to hear that?

67
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:35,688
N-No!

68
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:38,058
No, but...

69
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,948
You are happy.

70
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:45,328
Excuse me, driver.

71
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:48,738
What is it, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei?

72
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,588
I'm in no hurry.

73
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:54,498
We can take the long way around.

74
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:55,338
What?

75
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,208
Thank you.

76
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,618
Oh, right.

77
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:04,468
Great Detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei.

78
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:07,198
What is it, driver?

79
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:10,238
"The long way around" reminds me...

80
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,208
"The long way around"?

81
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,478
...of the strange brothers in sunglasses.

82
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:16,858
Strange brothers in sunglasses?

83
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,348
Yes.

84
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:25,318
Yesterday I picked them up at the
intersection near the Birinmon Fish Market.

85
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:33,358
How did I know they were brothers?

86
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,438
Keep...

87
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,158
...going...

88
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:40,218
...straight...

89
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:42,218
...ahead.

90
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:48,718
Only brothers could achieve
such impressive harmony.

91
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,538
What was their destination?

92
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:52,748
I'm not telling.

93
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:58,358
So, did those brothers in sunglasses
take the long way around?

94
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:01,608
Impressive, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

95
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,738
Marvelous deduction!

96
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:08,528
I know, Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei.

97
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,408
What is it?

98
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:14,288
To thank you for riding, I'll show
you the long route they took.

99
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,128
You don't need to do that!

100
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,878
No, allow me!

101
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,378
Don't!

102
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,888
Birinmon Fish Market

103
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:35,888
This is the intersection where I picked
up the strange brothers in sunglasses.

104
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:42,518
I drove straight ahead one light, two lights,

105
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:47,168
and turned left at the third light.

106
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,778
Around here was an industrial area.

107
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:58,538
I turned left onto the one-way along the
concrete embankment on the Teimuzu River.

108
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:07,048
After driving straight ahead for a while,
we passed a rooftop park on the left.

109
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:13,978
We passed the park and drove
one, two, three, four,

110
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,478
and turned left onto the fifth street.

111
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:27,938
After turning left onto the second road,
there was a small coin-operated parking lot.

112
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,658
They asked me to stop here
so I stopped the car.

113
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,908
Stop here.

114
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:43,668
Sir, if you wanted to come here,

115
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:48,748
there was a faster and cheaper
route we could have taken.

116
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:51,968
It's fine.

117
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,178
It is?

118
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:56,428
It's fine. It's fine.

119
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:57,558
What?

120
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,448
Keep the meter running.

121
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,308
What?

122
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,048
Once we conclude...

123
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,388
...our business...

124
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:08,298
...we will return.

125
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,238
What?

126
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,398
The door.

127
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:12,318
Yes, sir.

128
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:22,478
At first I thought they'd skipped out
on their fare, but they paid me later.

129
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,248
Where did the brothers in
sunglasses go after getting off?

130
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:31,258
They climbed those stone
steps down to the riverbank.

131
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:40,768
This must be the great detective Mori
Kogoro-dai-sensei's sleeping deduction!

132
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:47,648
"Why did those strange brothers
in sunglasses take a long route

133
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:51,318
to come to this parking lot and climb
those steps to the embankment?"

134
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:54,018
He must be solving the case right now!

135
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:56,158
Oh, he's so cool!

136
00:09:56,858 --> 00:10:01,518
I love the great detective
Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei.

137
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:11,668
Open the door! Open this door!

138
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:20,248
Great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

139
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:21,708
Ghost Chimney Festival

140
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,078
What's that sound?
Ghost Chimney Festival

141
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:23,688
Ghost Chimney Festival

142
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,858
Probably drum practice for
the Ghost Chimney Festival.

143
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,838
Ghost Chimney Festival?

144
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,318
I knew it.

145
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:50,948
Before the war, in this place
stood some large "Ghost Chimneys"

146
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:55,588
that produced smoke in a variety of colors.

147
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,728
They were destroyed in the war,
and now this place is a park.

148
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:04,198
But the people of Birinmon City,
nostalgic for the Ghost Chimneys,

149
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,598
starting holding the Ghost Chimney Festival.

150
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,788
There are shops, too.

151
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:14,578
Due to Halloween's influence, they
sell ghost costumes and products.

152
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:17,268
The festival is a huge hit.

153
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,618
It was posted online,

154
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:25,218
and ghost-lovers from not just
Japan but all over the world come.

155
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,358
Sounds like a lot of people.

156
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:34,688
That's why the Ghost Chimney Festival's
executive committee headquarters got a big safe.

157
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:43,308
Executive Committee Headquarters
Ghost Chimney Festival

158
00:11:57,418 --> 00:12:00,318
What happens to the money
they collect in the safe?

159
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:03,948
The bank sends a collection
car to come get it.

160
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,388
The bank's collection car?

161
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:07,408
This.

162
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:08,648
Traffic Restriction Notice
Traffic will be restricted on the day
of the festival as described below
Keyaki Road 11:00 – 15:00
Kitanaka Road 10:00 – 16:00
Shijo Road 11:00 – 16:00

163
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:14,958
It's a flier for traffic restrictions on
the day of the Ghost Chimney Festival.
Traffic Restriction Notice
Traffic will be restricted on the day
of the festival as described below
Keyaki Road 11:00 – 15:00
Kitanaka Road 10:00 – 16:00
Shijo Road 11:00 – 16:00

164
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:21,718
The stalls close at 3PM, so the
collection car comes around four.

165
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,098
Where can cars be parked in this area?

166
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:28,348
Just those two coin-operated parking lots.

167
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,448
I see. So that's how it is.

168
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:38,448
All better...

169
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:42,658
The great detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

170
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:47,328
Sensei, why did those strange
brothers in sunglasses

171
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:52,288
take the long way around to this park?

172
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:56,608
Tell me what you've deduced,
Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

173
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,738
Well...

174
00:12:58,738 --> 00:12:59,798
Well?

175
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:04,788
The strange brothers in sunglasses
were holding an endurance contest.

176
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,358
Endurance contest?

177
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:10,328
To see who could hold going
to the bathroom longer.

178
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:12,658
I see!

179
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,338
Impressive as always, Great
Detective Mori Kogoro-dai-sensei!

180
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,068
Clap, clap!

181
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:18,708
Clap, clap!

182
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:25,978
I know how the brothers in sunglasses
took the long way around

183
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:27,498
by taxi on their way back.

184
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:28,738
What?

185
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:30,975
Ghost Chimney Festival

186
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:41,985
Armadillo-kun! Where are you? Hey!

187
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:45,335
Armadillo-kun!

188
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:50,995
Damn it. I'll find the
barmaid's pet Armadillo-kun.

189
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:00,885
Huh?

190
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,365
Four eyes, where did he go?

191
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,745
He must've headed to the shops.

192
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:10,215
Did Ran give him some spending money?

193
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:11,645
That brat...

194
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:17,775
Ghost Chimney Festival Executive Committee

195
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:21,965
This is the only place where cars
can park near the festival grounds.
Ghost Chimney Festival Executive Committee

196
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:22,525
Ghost Chimney Festival Executive Committee

197
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,655
The bank's collection car parks here,

198
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:29,885
and the security guards go to the
grounds to collect the money.

199
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:36,935
During that time, the brothers in sunglasses
parked their own car in the adjacent space.

200
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:44,675
When the security guards returned
after collecting the money...

201
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,685
They stole the money and fled.

202
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,685
Finders keepers!

203
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,045
Up!

204
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,195
Heave, ho!

205
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,405
It's not them.

206
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:29,855
The brothers in sunglasses won't
be able to park their car here.

207
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:33,145
Where will they park instead?

208
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,455
There.

209
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:50,115
Finders keepers!

210
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,415
It's the only way.

211
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:57,575
3PM. The shops should close soon.

212
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,635
4PM. It's about time.

213
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:16,425
They're here.

214
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,975
The brothers' car should show up soon.

215
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:44,845
Huh?

216
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,545
Hey, Armadillo-kun!

217
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,055
The old man?

218
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:51,555
Armadillo-kun, where are you?

219
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:53,805
Armadillo-kun?

220
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,185
It's them!

221
00:17:56,495 --> 00:18:02,355
Only brothers could achieve
such impressive harmony.

222
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,235
It's a robbery!

223
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,535
Catch those men!

224
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:08,425
Huh?

225
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:14,075
Kid!

226
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:19,585
Damn! Their plan was to disguise themselves as
the agents from the start and steal the money!

227
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,495
I know their escape route.

228
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:31,065
After that car!

229
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:33,075
I don't know what's going on, but...

230
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:55,215
Birinmon Fish Market

231
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:12,485
What's going on?

232
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:20,825
Damn you!

233
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,085
Take this!

234
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,595
Take this!

235
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,535
Armadillo-kun.

236
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:07,855
After picking him up at
the Birinmon Fish Market,

237
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:10,415
the two of us

238
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:16,925
used Armadillo-kun to stop
the bank's collection car

239
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:25,435
and hijack it!

240
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:31,445
They sneeze normally.

241
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,495
Thank you for waiting.

242
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:07,455
I found your missing pet Armadillo-kun.

243
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:12,535
Thank you, great detective
Mori Kogoro-sensei.

244
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,585
But this isn't an ordinary pet.

245
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:16,905
What?

246
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:18,835
Not an ordinary pet?

247
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:27,595
I'm going to have Armadillo-kun earn
money for me as an animal actor.

248
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:36,105
What?!

249
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:39,945
Why not team up with him, Mori-sensei?

250
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:42,125
No, thank you!

251
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,455
Oh, there he goes again!

252
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:48,285
Mori-sensei, catch him!

253
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:49,955
No way!

254
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,425
Armadillo Kogoro...
