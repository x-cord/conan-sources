1
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.770
This is The Metropolitan Police Department!

2
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.970
Iwao Takatori!

3
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.770
You're under arrest for robbing a jewelry store!

4
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.970
"Iwao Takatori (38)" -You're a bunch of uncultured fools.

5
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.870
How dare you interrupt my coffee time?

6
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.570
Where's your accomplice?

7
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.070
Where did you hide the jewels you stole?

8
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.470
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.970
Don't play dumb.

10
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.070
We know you entered a Beika City jewelry store

11
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.870
at 8:00 pm last night

12
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.270
and stole 300 million yen worth of jewels.

13
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.470
"Tokuro Utsumi (32)" -Your accomplice is...

14
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.770
Tokuro Utsumi, 32 years old.

15
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.170
Isn't he the partner you've worked with several times now?

16
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.970
Utsumi?

17
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.270
He's not my partner!

18
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.370
What?

19
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.670
So?

20
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.370
Were our faces caught on a security camera or something?

21
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.970
Well, actually...

22
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.470
In that case, we're done here.

23
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.770
No.

24
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.470
There's still plenty for us to discuss, Takatori.

25
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.570
The Sleeping Kogoro.

26
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.670
Waiting until just before a store closes

27
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.570
to steal the freshly acquired expensive jewels

28
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.770
with guns as a pair.

29
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.870
That's your specialty, Takatori.

30
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.770
One more thing,

31
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.170
even though you always wore masks,

32
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.670
there was a incriminating piece of evidence

33
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.470
captured by the cameras.

34
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.270
You're sure, Mouri?

35
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.470
Of course, Inspector.

36
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.470
That is...

37
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.270
What?

38
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.870
Run!

39
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.070
To the rear exit.

40
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.670
Don't move!

41
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.870
Takatori, stop right...

42
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.970
Conan?

43
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.670
Kid?

44
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.770
What are you doing here?

45
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.670
It's too dangerous. You should go.

46
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.670
Stand up.

47
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.770
Don't move.

48
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.370
I'll blow the kid's head apart...

49
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.470
like a crushed tomato.

50
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.670
-Wait! -Takatori!

51
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.470
Conan!

52
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.770
Darn.

53
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.870
Find them!

54
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.170
Hurry!

55
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.070
When the countdown reaches zero,

56
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.470
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

57
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.670
I'm kidnapped in the middle of solving a mystery!

58
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.670
This is a first!

59
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.170
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.370
His name is Detective Conan!

62
00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:32.728
"Conan Kidnapped (Part 1)"

63
00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:35.128
"Checkpoint"

64
00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:41.728
I see.

65
00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:42.828
While I was sleeping...

66
00:05:42.828 --> 00:05:45.228
Rather, while I was explaining my reasoning,

67
00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:47.128
that's what happened.

68
00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:48.928
But, Inspector,

69
00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:52.628
we should prioritize rescuing the kid

70
00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:55.828
over redeeming my name after being interrupted.

71
00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:57.428
I know that.

72
00:05:57.428 --> 00:05:59.328
In addition to setting up checkpoints,

73
00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:02.028
we'll reinvestigate yesterday's case.

74
00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:13.128
What's going on?

75
00:06:17.328 --> 00:06:19.028
There's a checkpoint up ahead.

76
00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:20.028
What will you do?

77
00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:26.028
Looks like you know where you want to go...

78
00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:29.828
But you can't just keep going forward.

79
00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:37.728
So the jewels that were stolen yesterday

80
00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:41.928
had arrived just before the store closed?

81
00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:44.028
"Teruaki Shimazu (55)" -Yes. When I looked it up later,

82
00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:45.228
it became clear.

83
00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:47.228
They were all expensive jewels

84
00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:49.428
worth at least five million yen.

85
00:06:49.428 --> 00:06:51.628
This is a major blow to the store.

86
00:06:51.628 --> 00:06:53.128
I don't know what to do.

87
00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:57.628
I assume your delivery schedule was confidential.

88
00:06:57.628 --> 00:06:59.128
Of course.

89
00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:02.828
I hadn't even told my employees until just beforehand.

90
00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:04.228
Right?

91
00:07:04.228 --> 00:07:07.328
"Setsuo Yamaga (43), Jewelry Store Buyer" -Yes. I have no idea

92
00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:09.728
who or how it was leaked.

93
00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:14.728
But there's your supplier and the delivery company.

94
00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.628
Weren't there some things you had no control over?

95
00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:21.528
I suppose you're right.

96
00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:24.828
Inspector, have you heard from Takagi and Chiba?

97
00:07:24.828 --> 00:07:26.228
Not yet.

98
00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:28.228
The checkpoints haven't reported

99
00:07:28.228 --> 00:07:31.828
finding the car we're looking for either.

100
00:07:31.828 --> 00:07:35.428
Then we'll have to follow this thread for now.

101
00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:41.228
We've got to find a clue to the kid and Takatori's whereabouts.

102
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:44.628
I'll have them investigate the jewelry supplier

103
00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:47.028
and delivery company immediately.

104
00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:48.328
Please do!

105
00:07:54.128 --> 00:07:55.528
What?

106
00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:56.528
Now that I get a better look,

107
00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:58.628
this car doesn't have a navigator system.

108
00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:01.728
Since we're on Kitahinode Road,

109
00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:04.728
if you take the side road we passed earlier,

110
00:08:04.728 --> 00:08:07.928
you'll end up on Nakahotoke Road.

111
00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:13.628
I like going for drives,

112
00:08:13.628 --> 00:08:16.228
so I remembered all the streets.

113
00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:18.528
We can go shopping.

114
00:08:18.528 --> 00:08:19.828
What?

115
00:08:19.828 --> 00:08:21.228
The rope ladder.

116
00:08:21.228 --> 00:08:23.628
I don't know what it's for,

117
00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.228
but you dropped it while you were running.

118
00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:30.428
I thought there might be a home improvement store along a city road.

119
00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:34.428
You're an interesting kid.

120
00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:49.228
"Shingetsu Bar"

121
00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:56.328
"Kitahinode Shopping Center"

122
00:09:00.228 --> 00:09:02.328
"Kitahinode Shopping Center"

123
00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:08.428
Anyone. Is anyone here?

124
00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:12.128
How about a public phone?

125
00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:23.028
Are all the stores here closed down?

126
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:30.628
Oh, no!

127
00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:36.828
He's coming.

128
00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:37.828
He's going to run me over.

129
00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:53.028
"Do Not Enter"

130
00:10:09.328 --> 00:10:11.028
"Shingetsu Bar"

131
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.128
Let's go.

132
00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:14.128
What?

133
00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:24.428
I didn't get a good look at those matches,

134
00:10:24.428 --> 00:10:26.228
and I've already forgotten what was on them.

135
00:10:26.228 --> 00:10:30.328
I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

136
00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:33.128
Actually, if you take me with you,

137
00:10:33.128 --> 00:10:35.428
you'll probably draw even more attention to yourself.

138
00:10:35.428 --> 00:10:37.128
No matter how you look at it,

139
00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:40.928
you're clearly not my dad or brother.

140
00:10:43.728 --> 00:10:47.528
But maybe we should switch cars.

141
00:10:47.528 --> 00:10:51.628
We could even get license plates from another car.

142
00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:53.928
I'm sure it'd be easy for you.

143
00:10:57.928 --> 00:11:02.128
If only we could listen to the police radio.

144
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.728
We'd know how much they've figured out

145
00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:06.128
and what they're looking for,

146
00:11:06.128 --> 00:11:08.428
even the locations of the checkpoints.

147
00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:13.428
What?

148
00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:33.495
I didn't get a good look at those matches,

149
00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:35.295
and I've already forgotten what was on them.

150
00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:39.395
I promise I won't tell anyone about you.

151
00:11:39.395 --> 00:11:42.195
Actually, if you take me with you,

152
00:11:42.195 --> 00:11:44.395
you'll probably draw even more attention.

153
00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:46.195
No matter how you look at it,

154
00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:49.995
you're clearly not my dad or brother.

155
00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:56.595
But maybe we should switch cars.

156
00:11:56.595 --> 00:12:00.595
We could even get license plates from another car.

157
00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.995
I'm sure it'd be easy for you.

158
00:12:06.995 --> 00:12:11.195
If only we could listen to the police radio.

159
00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:12.695
We'd know how much they've figured out

160
00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:15.095
and what they're looking for,

161
00:12:15.095 --> 00:12:18.095
even the locations of the checkpoints.

162
00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:19.095
What?

163
00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:28.795
I won't say it again. Shut up.

164
00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:31.295
Okay.

165
00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:34.695
I wouldn't mind tying you up

166
00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:39.095
and keeping you in the trunk until we get there.

167
00:12:39.095 --> 00:12:40.195
There?

168
00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:47.195
Where are we going when he knows I'd slow him down?

169
00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:49.995
"Lulu Port, Underground Parking Entrance"

170
00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:51.895
"Underground Parking Entrance"

171
00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:17.095
He doesn't have all the jewels he stole right now.

172
00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:18.795
Which means...

173
00:13:18.795 --> 00:13:20.695
he's most likely going to find the rest of the jewels

174
00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:23.595
and his accomplice.

175
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:24.795
But...

176
00:13:24.795 --> 00:13:26.695
Utsumi?

177
00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:30.195
He's not my partner!

178
00:13:30.195 --> 00:13:32.295
What happened?

179
00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:43.695
What is that?

180
00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.595
Listen up. Try to run, and I'll shoot.

181
00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:54.295
If you don't want to die here

182
00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:57.695
and get torn apart by stray dogs,

183
00:13:57.695 --> 00:13:59.595
do as I say.

184
00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:04.395
I just need to get a new rope ladder.

185
00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:06.595
Okay, got it.

186
00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:11.295
That way.

187
00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:16.695
Stop there.

188
00:14:17.995 --> 00:14:21.195
Is this the entrance to that chimney?

189
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.095
That's right.

190
00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:24.595
I see.

191
00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:27.395
So that's why you needed a rope ladder.

192
00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:30.095
I was going to use it to climb down into the chimney,

193
00:14:30.095 --> 00:14:32.195
but now I don't need to.

194
00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:34.395
I've got you.

195
00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:38.795
You want me to go in here?

196
00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:41.895
Inspector Megure.

197
00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:44.495
We found Takatori's car.

198
00:14:44.495 --> 00:14:45.795
Where?

199
00:14:45.795 --> 00:14:48.095
"Shopping Mall" -It was abandoned in the underground parking lot

200
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:52.395
of a shopping mall on Nakahotoke Road.

201
00:14:52.395 --> 00:14:54.595
What about the kid?

202
00:14:54.595 --> 00:15:01.295
So far nobody's reported seeing Conan or Takatori.

203
00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:02.895
So they walked out of there?

204
00:15:02.895 --> 00:15:07.195
Or did they change cars?

205
00:15:07.195 --> 00:15:08.395
That must be it.

206
00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:11.895
The question is, where did they go?

207
00:15:11.895 --> 00:15:16.995
It's got to be wherever the jewels and his accomplice is.

208
00:15:16.995 --> 00:15:21.295
We'll have to broaden the area of our search.

209
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.695
Takagi, Chiba.

210
00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:23.795
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

211
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.695
This is Megure.

212
00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:34.595
What?

213
00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:36.495
What does that mean?

214
00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:41.095
Got it.

215
00:15:41.095 --> 00:15:43.595
Thank you.

216
00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:45.695
What is it, Inspector?

217
00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.695
That was the local police.

218
00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.295
They can't find Yamaga,

219
00:15:50.295 --> 00:15:54.495
the buyer for the jewelry store that was robbed.

220
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.295
"Setsuo Yamaga (43), Buyer" -What?

221
00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:57.395
Then...

222
00:15:57.395 --> 00:15:58.495
Yeah.

223
00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:01.395
It happened as soon as we started checking their supplier

224
00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:03.095
and delivery company.

225
00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.595
Inspector.

226
00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:05.995
Let's head back to the crime scene.

227
00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:11.495
Darn.

228
00:16:11.495 --> 00:16:13.095
It must've happened then.

229
00:16:19.795 --> 00:16:24.195
Now this is truly unexpected.

230
00:16:24.195 --> 00:16:25.995
Are you listening, kid?

231
00:16:27.995 --> 00:16:30.295
Come back in exactly three minutes.

232
00:16:30.295 --> 00:16:32.595
If you're even a second late,

233
00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:35.795
I'll throw this down there.

234
00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:37.195
You must be joking.

235
00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:41.195
If you do that, I'll get caught in the smoke and suffocate.

236
00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:42.995
Got it, kid?

237
00:16:44.595 --> 00:16:45.795
Got it.

238
00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:48.195
Darn.

239
00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:49.695
This isn't my lucky day.

240
00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:53.295
What exactly is going on?

241
00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:55.595
We're about to investigate that.

242
00:16:58.895 --> 00:16:59.895
Excuse me.

243
00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:06.495
What are these?

244
00:17:06.495 --> 00:17:08.295
I thought so.

245
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:11.095
Was it Yamaga?

246
00:17:11.095 --> 00:17:15.095
Yes. It's probably what the thieves paid him

247
00:17:15.095 --> 00:17:16.795
for leaking the information.

248
00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:18.095
What?

249
00:17:18.095 --> 00:17:21.695
If we looked into the supplier and delivery company,

250
00:17:21.695 --> 00:17:24.895
we eventually would've discovered that he was the one person

251
00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:27.895
with all the information,

252
00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:30.495
so he made a hasty escape.

253
00:17:30.495 --> 00:17:31.895
That must be it.

254
00:17:31.895 --> 00:17:34.695
I don't believe it.

255
00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:36.395
Find him immediately.

256
00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.295
A dead end?

257
00:17:46.395 --> 00:17:47.995
It's the bottom of the chimney.

258
00:17:53.795 --> 00:17:54.795
What?

259
00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:00.595
This man...

260
00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:01.995
He's...

261
00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:03.995
"Tokuro Utsumi (32)"

262
00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:07.495
The jewelry robber's accomplice Utsumi.

263
00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:11.795
The cause of death is...

264
00:18:11.795 --> 00:18:13.995
a whole body contusion?

265
00:18:19.395 --> 00:18:22.995
Hey, what's he doing here?

266
00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:25.295
Did you kill him?

267
00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:26.995
Just the opposite.

268
00:18:26.995 --> 00:18:28.995
He nearly killed me.

269
00:18:32.395 --> 00:18:34.795
All right!

270
00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:36.995
What a massive success.

271
00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:39.995
Let's celebrate.

272
00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:41.495
Not yet.

273
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:42.795
What?

274
00:18:42.795 --> 00:18:45.495
We'll hand the goods over to him in exchange for money,

275
00:18:45.495 --> 00:18:47.095
just like we planned.

276
00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:49.395
We'll celebrate after,

277
00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:51.795
two hours from now at that location.

278
00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:53.895
Got it. You can count on me.

279
00:18:54.895 --> 00:18:56.995
See you later.

280
00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:10.895
He's still not here.

281
00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.195
Utsumi!

282
00:20:08.095 --> 00:20:09.995
It's been three minutes.

283
00:20:09.995 --> 00:20:11.995
Come back.

284
00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:14.795
I'll smoke you out.

285
00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:16.195
Don't.

286
00:20:16.195 --> 00:20:18.095
I'll be right back.

287
00:20:18.095 --> 00:20:19.295
Darn.

288
00:20:19.295 --> 00:20:22.695
It's covered in soot, so there aren't any clues.

289
00:20:22.695 --> 00:20:25.995
I won't be able to climb up there.

290
00:20:25.995 --> 00:20:28.995
I have to head back.

291
00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:34.795
Is this all?

292
00:20:34.795 --> 00:20:36.895
Hiding them won't do you any good.

293
00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:38.595
I'm not hiding anything.

294
00:20:38.595 --> 00:20:40.995
I thought it was strange, too.

295
00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:45.495
Didn't you steal 300 million yen worth of jewels?

296
00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.895
This clearly isn't enough.

297
00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:51.595
It was him.

298
00:20:51.595 --> 00:20:54.995
He talked him into it.

299
00:20:54.995 --> 00:20:57.495
For less than half a share,

300
00:20:57.495 --> 00:21:00.095
he agreed to kill me.

301
00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:03.195
Idiot!

302
00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:06.295
Who's "he"?

303
00:21:06.295 --> 00:21:09.995
Mister, maybe you were betrayed.

304
00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:12.295
What are you going to do now?

305
00:21:12.295 --> 00:21:14.695
Are you going to...

306
00:21:25.595 --> 00:21:27.995
Your job's over.

307
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:31.795
Keep your curiosity in check.

308
00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:34.995
If you think I won't kill a kid,

309
00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:36.595
you're dead wrong.

310
00:21:49.295 --> 00:21:51.095
Where?

311
00:21:51.095 --> 00:21:52.995
Where are we going?

312
00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:02.995
He's slowing down?

313
00:22:02.995 --> 00:22:04.595
What's happening?

314
00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:06.695
What's he going to do?

315
00:22:06.695 --> 00:22:09.895
Want to get out again, kid?

316
00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:12.995
If you're lucky, you might be saved.

317
00:22:17.095 --> 00:22:18.195
What?

318
00:22:24.495 --> 00:22:25.795
Farewell.

319
00:23:54.895 --> 00:23:56.895
"Next Episode" -There's no mistaking it.

320
00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:58.595
The body inside the chimney belongs to

321
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:00.895
Takatori's accomplice, Utsumi.

322
00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:01.995
Please.

323
00:24:01.995 --> 00:24:04.595
Please help me look for him.

324
00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:06.995
Got it.

325
00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:10.495
You've forgotten my share.

326
00:24:10.495 --> 00:24:14.795
And the fee you owe Utsumi for hiring him to kill me!

327
00:24:14.795 --> 00:24:17.195
Too scared to talk?

328
00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:20.495
Next Conan,

329
00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:24.195
"Conan Kidnapped (Part 2)"

330
00:24:24.438 --> 00:24:27.038
Next Conan's Hint:

331
00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:29.138
"Socks"

332
00:24:29.138 --> 00:24:30.738
I finally understand how hard your life is.

333
00:24:30.738 --> 00:24:32.638
-Pops. -Nothing's worse than being interrupted

334
00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.238
-while you're drinking. -What?
