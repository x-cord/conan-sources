1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,870
"Lost! Nyan (Male). Reward."

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,070
Oh, Nyan.

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,270
You've lost so much weight.

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,870
-Thank you so much. -No problem.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,070
I tell you.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,570
Why does a famed detective like me go around searching for lost cats?

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,370
Who cares, you got paid a good sum, right?

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,270
Well, I guess so.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,170
Then, let's go have something good to eat.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,470
I see, so that's why you're tagging along.

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,270
Then since it's already past noon,

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,070
shall we go to a fast food restaurant?

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,370
Let's go some place better.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,970
Yeah, when I'm by myself.

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,970
-Cheapskate. -Did you say something?

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,970
Nope, nothing.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,170
It seems to have come from downstairs!

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,170
Yeah.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,970
Is anything wrong?

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,070
The room's been ransacked

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,170
and there's blood on the floor too.

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,270
Did you go inside?

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,970
We're too scared to go in.

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,370
Got it.

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,170
Then, you all stay here.

26
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,270
I'll go check things out.

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,070
No good, he's dead.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,870
Excuse me, please call the police.

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,870
What? Where's the other lady?

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,870
Saki!

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,870
-Saki! -Hold it!

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,070
Saki!

33
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,370
Saki!

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,070
Open your eyes!

35
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,770
Miss, please back away.

36
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,270
No good.

37
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,670
No...

38
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,170
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

39
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,570
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

40
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,470
Two victims within the first two minutes.

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,670
The trick behind the case defies imagination.

42
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,370
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,870
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:35,928
"The Socialite Couple's Secret"

46
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,328
I see.

47
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,428
You came to the front door, sensed something was wrong

48
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,528
and was about to call the police.

49
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,828
Then, he came.

50
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,728
Yes, that's right.

51
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:01,028
And then this kid and I went inside to check things out.

52
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:05,228
And we found a man dead in the living room.

53
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,928
Then, you found a woman dead in the bedroom,

54
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,028
and reported it to the police.

55
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,728
Yes, that's correct.

56
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:20,528
And? Why did you all come here to begin with?

57
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,128
"Yoshie Hayashi (62), Apartment Manager" - Since the two over there

58
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:26,928
said they wanted me to open this room, so I came to open it.

59
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:27,928
See.

60
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:33,028
I was hired asked to pick up a package.

61
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:37,128
I promised Saki that I would go shopping with her.

62
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,628
And I came to get her because she didn't show up.

63
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:42,028
I see.

64
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:43,428
Inspector Megure.

65
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:46,628
Oh, good work, how is it?

66
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,628
All the neighbors are out,

67
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:54,128
and we haven't found any telling evidence.

68
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:59,428
Only valuables such as cash cards, bank books and jewelry are missing.

69
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:01,128
Judging from the messiness of this room,

70
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,128
it's highly likely that the room was broken into.

71
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,828
And has the victim been identified?

72
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,428
The man found dead in the living room

73
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:13,528
is Mr. Seiichi Maehara, age 32, a day trader.

74
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:16,628
In other words, he was a stock investor.

75
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,928
It seems that he was stabbed several times in his chest

76
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:21,028
with a sharp object

77
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,328
and died of excessive blood loss.

78
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:28,028
It seems he made a load from stock recently.

79
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:31,828
Tens of millions have been transferred to his bank account.

80
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:35,228
This has already been confirmed with the investment company.

81
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,328
Which means that the perp was after this money?

82
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:40,828
Most probably so.

83
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:43,528
And what about the woman in the bedroom?

84
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:47,728
She is Seiichi's wife, Mrs. Saki Maehara.

85
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:50,628
Age 29, a housewife.

86
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:53,028
The cause of her death is suffocation

87
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,228
from having her nose and mouth airways blocked.

88
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,628
What is the estimated time of death?

89
00:06:57,628 --> 00:07:04,528
Mr. Maehara died around 11am and his wife around 12.30pm.

90
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,628
Inspector Megure.

91
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:11,428
Around 11am, someone who looked to be the perp was seen

92
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,128
going in through the entrance of the condo

93
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,228
on the security camera.

94
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,728
What?

95
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,028
This is a print out of that image.

96
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:26,228
With all this disguise, it's hard to make out the features.

97
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,228
Does this person look familiar to any of you?

98
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:30,728
No.

99
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,228
I see.

100
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:35,128
And, there's one more thing.

101
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:38,828
The security camera by the emergency stairs was broken.

102
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:40,528
The emergency stairs?

103
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,628
Yes.

104
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,528
Oh, it was broken two days ago.

105
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,928
It's a bad prank.

106
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,228
I see.

107
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:51,028
But, the footage of the person

108
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:54,828
entering and exiting the building is here,

109
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:58,228
so the damaged camera probably had nothing to do with this case.

110
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:02,628
I guess it'll be safe to say that this person is

111
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:05,328
somehow involved in the killing of Mr. and Mrs. Maehara.

112
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:09,828
Put out an APB and search for this individual!

113
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:10,828
Yes, sir!

114
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,928
There you are.

115
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:36,228
We're going home.

116
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:38,128
We're going home already?

117
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:40,628
All that's left to do is for the police to find the perp

118
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,428
and make the arrest.

119
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,428
My job as a detective is finished.

120
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:45,928
Okay.

121
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,128
So, Inspector, we'll be on our way then.

122
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,328
All right, thank you.

123
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:56,028
-Inspector Megure. -What's up?

124
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,828
The forensics found this.

125
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,228
This is...

126
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,528
There's blood on it

127
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:09,528
and I guess we could say it was used to commit the crime.

128
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,928
Officer Chiba, where was this found?

129
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,228
Well, it was in the trash bin of this condo.

130
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:17,228
What?

131
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,728
It's a lie! I can't believe something like that.

132
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:28,328
Well, please calm down.

133
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:32,828
We were contacted by officers that were asking around in that area,

134
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:35,428
and found that Saki had purchased

135
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:40,428
the clothes used in the robbery at a Do-It-Yourself store.

136
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:41,728
No...

137
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,428
It's hard to believe, is it?

138
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:46,428
Saki would never do something like that!

139
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:49,528
I understand you don't want to believe so,

140
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:52,428
however, from the inside of the knitted cap, some hair was collected

141
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,528
and it matched Saki's hair.

142
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,828
In other words, everything was a fake play.

143
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,528
It was a premeditated murder

144
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:03,528
that Saki had thought up taking advantage of the security camera.

145
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:07,328
So, now it's apparent why the security camera at the emergency stairs

146
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,828
-was broken too. -Yeah.

147
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:11,628
Just what do you mean?

148
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:14,828
After she disguised herself as the robber and went outside,

149
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,128
she disposed of the evidence in the trash bin.

150
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,628
In order to return to the apartment,

151
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:22,928
she needed to take the back road to avoid the security camera.

152
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:42,728
Then, why did she suffocate to death?

153
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,628
There was nothing odd about it,

154
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,128
so I guess we could conclude that it was an accident that occurred

155
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,528
when she tried to pretend that she was a victim.

156
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,928
She tied her own hands and feet,

157
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:57,428
and went inside the closet, but...

158
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:01,828
Because of the large amount of clothes, she was unable to breathe.

159
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,428
An unfortunate accident.

160
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:06,228
Rather the really unfortunate one was probably

161
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:10,228
the husband who ended up being killed by his wife, though...

162
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,728
Saki... this can't be true.

163
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,628
It's utterly unbelievable.

164
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:19,728
I guess you were all called here by her to become the first people

165
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:22,128
to discover the crime.

166
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:23,628
Me?

167
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,128
No...

168
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,028
Saki!

169
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,328
Saki!

170
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,028
Open your eyes!

171
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,428
Here again.

172
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,128
We're going home, I said.

173
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:01,528
We've missed out on eating lunch completely.

174
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,028
I'm starved!

175
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:11,628
All the expensive suits are going to be wrinkled.

176
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:14,228
No matter how you pretend to be on the surface,

177
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:18,728
people are what they really are in hidden places.

178
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:41,528
Hey, don't go snooping around!

179
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,428
Maybe...

180
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,295
Inspector Megure!

181
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:05,695
Inspector!

182
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,495
According to the report from forensics,

183
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,995
they found her fingerprints on the band

184
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:13,695
that was tied onto her corpse.

185
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:15,795
What about other fingerprints?

186
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,295
No other prints were found on that band.

187
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:22,595
There were fingerprints of Ms. Maiko Hori on the masking tape though.

188
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,995
It probably got there

189
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:27,295
because she tried to peel off the masking tape after finding the body.

190
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:28,895
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,295
I was so shocked.

192
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:35,795
It's obvious that she tied herself.

193
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,095
Oh, no...

194
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:40,595
May I leave already?

195
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:43,495
I still have deliveries to make.

196
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:47,095
I've got work to do too.

197
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:51,095
Since we've concluded who the perp is, I guess it all right.

198
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,295
Excuse me then...

199
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,395
Mr. Mouri?

200
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:03,395
What? What seems to be the matter?

201
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:07,795
Please wait, the case hasn't been solved yet.

202
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,695
Just what're you talking about?

203
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,595
-The case has been... -Something's odd.

204
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,595
What is?

205
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:17,795
Although Officer Chiba found the murder weapon

206
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:22,195
that was used in this case in the trash bin of the condo.

207
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,295
Would the perp usually dispose of

208
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:27,395
such conclusive evidence

209
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:29,495
in such a place?

210
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,695
Maybe the perp thought it could be retrieved immediately.

211
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:34,795
Today is Saturday.

212
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,395
So the next trash is next week Monday.

213
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:40,595
Which means that the weapon would be left in the trash bin

214
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,495
for two days.

215
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,595
Yes.

216
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,095
I see.

217
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,095
So I thought

218
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,495
that it was probably just a temporary disposal place

219
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:56,395
and the perp was planning to move it somewhere else later.

220
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,495
But before the perp could move it,

221
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,895
the crime came to light?

222
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,695
And the conclusion this leads us to is...

223
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,595
She had an accomplice.

224
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:09,995
What?

225
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:12,695
Mr. Mouri, just exactly what do you mean?

226
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,495
I'm sure that she wants

227
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,995
to hide the evidence as soon as she possibly can.

228
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:19,595
But, according to her scenario,

229
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:24,195
she is supposed to be shoved into the closet.

230
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:29,595
If she was spotted disposing of the evidence someplace far away,

231
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,495
there would be discrepancies.

232
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,995
True.

233
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:36,695
That's why an accomplice to help her hide the evidence

234
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,895
was indispensible.

235
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,095
I see.

236
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:41,795
But Mr. Mouri,

237
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:45,895
the evidence was found in the trash bin of the condo.

238
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,195
That's right.

239
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:52,195
I guess some sort of trouble occurred between Saki and her accomplice.

240
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:55,595
That's why the evidence was left as is.

241
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:56,795
Which means...

242
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:01,395
Saki was murdered by her accomplice.

243
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:08,795
Please look at masking tape that covered Saki's mouth.

244
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:12,295
There are several lipstick marks all over it.

245
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:17,295
It's because Saki struggled when her accomplice

246
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:20,395
put the tape on her mouth.

247
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,995
If she covered her own mouth with it,

248
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:25,495
there would've been just one lipstick mark on it.

249
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,995
True.

250
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,195
Yeah.

251
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:33,395
Moreover, please take a good look at the closet.

252
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,995
There looks to be nothing in particular.

253
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:41,695
There are too many clothes relative to the volume of the closet.

254
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:44,795
All the expensive suits will become wrinkle

255
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,395
and no good this way.

256
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:50,495
I see.

257
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:53,795
Not only that, even the T-shirts

258
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:57,395
that would normally be put away in drawers are hung in the closet.

259
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,595
But doesn't that vary from household to household?

260
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:04,695
Some people hang T-shirts on hangers, you know.

261
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:06,995
Well, I guess so...

262
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:11,595
If you look at the T-shirts as well as some of the other clothes,

263
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:16,095
you can see that some are dirty, some are wrinkled,

264
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:18,495
some have been in the chest or worn

265
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,295
but despite of this are hung on the rack.

266
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,395
Mr. Mouri's right.

267
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,695
This clothes have been worn several times.

268
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,095
The others...

269
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,595
Smell like cigarette.

270
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:47,295
And this had been folded.

271
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:50,695
In other words, the accomplice tried to make the scene

272
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,195
look as if it were an accident.

273
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:56,295
Then, who is the perp?

274
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:58,195
Ms. Maiko.

275
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:00,795
Why did you run over to Saki without listening to me

276
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:02,495
when I tried to stop you?

277
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,595
What?

278
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:06,295
That's because I was worried about Saki.

279
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,195
Really?

280
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,995
Yes!

281
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:12,795
Isn't it actually because you needed to be the one

282
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:15,195
who discovered the corpse first?

283
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,695
What?

284
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,595
Mr. Mouri, just what are you getting at?

285
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,695
She was the first discoverer

286
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:25,495
in order to hide the fact that her prints were on the evidence.

287
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,295
Isn't that right?

288
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,895
Oh, the fingerprints that are on the masking tape.

289
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,395
-Oh. -That!

290
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,895
You're just making things up!

291
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:37,995
I was really worried about Saki.

292
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:40,195
You still won't confess?

293
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:43,795
Then, will you please show us what is inside you bag?

294
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,195
Why do you want to look into my bag?

295
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:50,795
Saki tried to hide her valuables somewhere.

296
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,195
But as you can see from the fact

297
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:54,695
that she threw the evidence into the trash bin,

298
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:57,295
she could only have thrown them away nearby.

299
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:01,295
If the police haven't found it yet,

300
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:05,595
it is highly probable that the accomplice took off with it.

301
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:08,395
Will you please show me the contents of your bag?

302
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,895
This is...

303
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,595
Maiko, why?

304
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:38,595
I went to Saki's room from the emergency stairs.

305
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,095
You're late!

306
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,395
All you have to do is

307
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,095
keep listening to what I tell you to do like usual!

308
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,495
Are you scared?

309
00:19:57,595 --> 00:20:00,295
You can't back out anymore, understand?

310
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:04,395
It's like you killed my husband, see.

311
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,895
No...

312
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:09,495
But, that's what accomplice are, right?

313
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:17,095
The evidence is in the trash bin.

314
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,995
Get rid of it.

315
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:00,795
It was about time that the courier was scheduled to come

316
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:03,495
so I rushed outside.

317
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,695
I didn't have time to move the evidence from the trash bin.

318
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,295
Even if the evidence were discovered,

319
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:12,295
everybody would've thought that Saki committed the crime.

320
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,295
You thought so, didn't you?

321
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,895
Yes.

322
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:18,295
She told me that she would give me some insurance money and besides,

323
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:23,195
she's always taken care of me since our high school days.

324
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:25,895
But, I got scared.

325
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:29,695
I thought I'd have to do as she said for the rest of my life.

326
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,995
I wanted to pull free from her.

327
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:12,295
"Family restaurant"

328
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,595
Are you going to be okay eating like that, Pops?

329
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:21,695
Idiot!

330
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:24,195
I missed out on lunch, you know.

331
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,495
And besides, as to the money...

332
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:31,095
What?

333
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:34,895
It's gone!

334
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:36,295
What's the matter?

335
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:40,995
I must've dropped the envelope with the money.

336
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:42,795
What?

337
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:44,695
What shall I do?

338
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:50,795
Next it's time to look for the envelope, Pops.

339
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,995
I wanted that reward.

340
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:55,995
"Next Episode"

341
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:58,295
A murder motivated by hatred.

342
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:03,595
What did you come here for?

343
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,795
He was dreadfully obnoxious.

344
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:12,195
Everybody in the neighborhood had a murder motive against him.

345
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,795
-What? -Off the point?

346
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:18,295
I guess this is one of those ABC murder cases.

347
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:20,395
Next Conan,

348
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:24,295
"The Shifting Mystery of Beika City (Part 1)"

349
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,338
Okay, Conan, go ahead.

350
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,238
Next Conan's Hint... huh?

351
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,338
"ABC murder case"

352
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:30,438
Do you have something you wanted say?

353
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:32,938
Let's watch The Crimson Love Letter before the sun goes down!

354
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,138
You sound like Doc.
