1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.640
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.840
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.540
Today's stage takes place in a wine cellar.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.640
Aged wine is the key to the crime.

5
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:04.353
"The Locked Wine Cellar"

9
00:02:04.953 --> 00:02:08.953
What a wonderful collection you have indeed!

10
00:02:10.353 --> 00:02:13.353
How pleasing to the eye!

11
00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:15.153
So, you're quite knowledgeable about wine, Mr. Mouri.

12
00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:17.753
Oh, well...

13
00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:20.553
"Shohei Kusaka (52)" -Just as expected of a renowned detective,

14
00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:22.153
to know of this collection.

15
00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:24.253
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

16
00:02:24.253 --> 00:02:25.853
This collection of labels

17
00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:29.153
is one that a noble family of Europe had collected

18
00:02:29.153 --> 00:02:31.353
over a long period of years.

19
00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:38.953
Mr. Mouri seems to have done it.

20
00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:41.453
I guess we won't be having wine for a while then.

21
00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.653
Huh? Won't be having wine for a while?

22
00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.453
Your father...

23
00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:47.553
"Takeo Nonaka (42)" -just complimented the collection, right?

24
00:02:47.553 --> 00:02:48.753
Then what happens is...

25
00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:51.753
As if a switch is turned on,

26
00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:54.853
he won't stop bragging about the collection.

27
00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:56.453
"Jokichi Tonomura (40)" -Mr. Mouri is going to be stuck there

28
00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:58.053
for a while.

29
00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:02.953
In other words, he's a wine freak.

30
00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:04.553
"Yukari Takano (38)" -Well, all he does

31
00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:07.453
is repeat the same dialog over and over.

32
00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.353
He'll say something like, "This is the gem of the whole collection

33
00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:12.453
that is very hard to get a hold of."

34
00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:14.653
This is Moselle wine,

35
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:16.953
a superb article that is very hard to get a hold of.

36
00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:21.553
Most people get fed up with his boasting

37
00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:24.653
and avoid coming to this party.

38
00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:27.853
Your father was given a handkerchief like this, wasn't he?

39
00:03:27.853 --> 00:03:28.853
Yes.

40
00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:30.953
He received a handkerchief with his initials

41
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.153
from Mrs. Kusaka a while ago.

42
00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:34.953
Oh, so he did after all.

43
00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:38.353
Anyone that Kusaka takes a liking to would definitely gets one.

44
00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:40.253
See, I got one too.

45
00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.653
But the worse is yet to come.

46
00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:46.353
He's going to keep inviting you to come to his parties.

47
00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:47.953
Well, I advise you to tell your father

48
00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:51.253
to never borrow money from Kusaka.

49
00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:54.653
If he does, he won't be able to turn down attending the party.

50
00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:58.353
So, you've all borrowed money from Mr. Kusaka?

51
00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:00.453
Oh, that's...

52
00:04:00.453 --> 00:04:02.353
Hey, Conan!

53
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.853
You sure hit a sore spot, sonny.

54
00:04:05.853 --> 00:04:07.053
You're absolutely right.

55
00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:11.153
All three of us owe Kusaka money.

56
00:04:11.153 --> 00:04:13.953
Mr. Nonaka borrowed money for gambling.

57
00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:18.153
Ms. Takano, for management funds for the art gallery that she runs.

58
00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:23.153
And me, for money to train myself as a sommelier.

59
00:04:23.153 --> 00:04:25.753
Oh, what are you all talking about?

60
00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:28.153
You all seem to be enjoying the conversation.

61
00:04:28.153 --> 00:04:31.053
Oh, we were just talking about how nice it is

62
00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:33.353
to come to Mr. Kusaka's party

63
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:36.853
because we get to drink fine wine here.

64
00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:39.953
My husband would be so happy to hear that.

65
00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:42.153
By the way, Mrs. Kusaka,

66
00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:45.453
what do you say we begin wine tasting soon?

67
00:04:45.453 --> 00:04:46.953
He's so absorbed in Mr. Mouri

68
00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.853
that it seems he's forgotten about us.

69
00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:54.053
All right, I'll go and tell him right now.

70
00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:55.853
Please do so.

71
00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:56.953
Oh, right!

72
00:04:56.953 --> 00:04:58.053
Now that you're here,

73
00:04:58.053 --> 00:05:00.953
let me show you my wine cellar in the basement.

74
00:05:00.953 --> 00:05:03.453
Huh? Oh, well...

75
00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:06.653
I've got my best wines in there.

76
00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:09.053
Dear.

77
00:05:09.053 --> 00:05:13.053
The other guests are waiting for you to start the wine tasting.

78
00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:14.553
Oh, no!

79
00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:16.553
I had completely forgotten!

80
00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:20.453
Thank God.

81
00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.753
Hi, everybody,

82
00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:24.153
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

83
00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:27.853
I thought the party was going to end the way things were going.

84
00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:29.653
Pardon me for my rudeness.

85
00:05:29.653 --> 00:05:32.153
Right! What do you say that

86
00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:35.253
we change plans for wine tasting

87
00:05:35.253 --> 00:05:38.853
and have Mr. Tonomura, the sommelier pick out the right wine?

88
00:05:40.453 --> 00:05:42.853
Well, it does sound interesting.

89
00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:44.953
If he's a sommelier it's only natural

90
00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:46.953
that he chooses all the wines correctly.

91
00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:50.253
Well, if Mr. Kusaka suggest to do so,

92
00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:53.153
he must have some very secret item in his possession.

93
00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:55.253
It is only natural for a sommelier to get the names of the wines right.

94
00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:58.653
But if he misses, he loses face.

95
00:05:58.653 --> 00:06:00.953
Therefore, there's got to be some merit for going through this.

96
00:06:00.953 --> 00:06:03.853
Okay, then let's do this.

97
00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:06.953
If Mr. Tonomura gets all the wines right,

98
00:06:06.953 --> 00:06:10.653
I'll take on the you-know-what thing.

99
00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:12.253
I see.

100
00:06:12.253 --> 00:06:14.853
I guess I'll just have to do it then.

101
00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:25.353
Okay, everyone,

102
00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:27.753
please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

103
00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.853
Here goes!

104
00:06:39.953 --> 00:06:42.353
Let me see...

105
00:07:08.753 --> 00:07:10.053
It's a good wine.

106
00:07:11.053 --> 00:07:14.953
This is Solaia from the Toscana district in Italy.

107
00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:19.053
Just as expected of you.

108
00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.653
Just as expected of you, Mr. Tonomura.

109
00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:30.953
There's far more to go, he's just warming up.

110
00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:44.253
This is very rare wine indeed!

111
00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:46.453
Chateau Latour, isn't it?

112
00:07:46.453 --> 00:07:48.853
Moreover of 1965.

113
00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:56.953
Well, utterly fantastic!

114
00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:58.853
He sure is a true sommelier!

115
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:02.853
It's as if he knew what wines were going to be given to him!

116
00:08:02.853 --> 00:08:05.153
Not really. Everything so far

117
00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:07.253
requires only a beginner sommelier's knowledge.

118
00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:11.753
Well, I'm so sorry that all the wine

119
00:08:11.753 --> 00:08:13.953
I have offered you to taste so far were all for beginners.

120
00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:17.253
Let me give you the best of my collection, then!

121
00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:24.453
Oh, no.

122
00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:27.053
So he rushes off to his pride and joy wine cellar.

123
00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:29.353
I feel a bit sorry for him.

124
00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:32.353
He's just getting a taste of his own medicine.

125
00:08:32.353 --> 00:08:35.553
Why don't we take a short break, everyone?

126
00:08:35.553 --> 00:08:37.753
I'm a bit tired myself.

127
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:44.253
I'm going to get a bit of fresh air and sober up.

128
00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:47.053
I guess I'll go to the restroom.

129
00:08:49.053 --> 00:08:51.053
Gosh, that sure makes us nervous, right?

130
00:08:51.053 --> 00:08:52.353
Yes.

131
00:08:59.653 --> 00:09:01.753
I can't tell at all.

132
00:09:01.753 --> 00:09:03.353
Mr. Mouri?

133
00:09:03.353 --> 00:09:04.453
Yes?

134
00:09:04.453 --> 00:09:07.053
Don't you think Mr. Kusaka is taking a bit too long?

135
00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:10.253
It's been 40 minutes since he went to his wine cellar.

136
00:09:10.253 --> 00:09:13.453
Has it been that long already?

137
00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:16.253
Excuse me, did you mention my husband?

138
00:09:16.253 --> 00:09:17.753
Oh, Mrs. Kusaka.

139
00:09:17.753 --> 00:09:19.953
It's been 40 minutes since your husband went down to the wine cellar

140
00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:22.653
and he hasn't come back yet.

141
00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:25.253
Goodness. I wonder what he's doing,

142
00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:26.753
making his guests wait like this?

143
00:09:26.753 --> 00:09:28.753
I'm so sorry, I'll go and get him right away.

144
00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:31.653
Mrs. Kusaka, let me go with you.

145
00:09:31.653 --> 00:09:33.753
After all, something may have happened.

146
00:09:33.753 --> 00:09:36.353
Thank you, please do.

147
00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:42.453
Hey, Conan! Wait!

148
00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:46.753
Please be careful because the stairs is quite steep.

149
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.153
Yes.

150
00:09:51.853 --> 00:09:52.953
Dear?

151
00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:54.453
What's wrong?

152
00:09:54.453 --> 00:09:57.853
Mr. Kusaka!

153
00:09:58.753 --> 00:10:00.153
Mr. Kusaka!

154
00:10:00.153 --> 00:10:02.153
Are you all right, Mr. Kusaka?

155
00:10:02.153 --> 00:10:03.753
Mrs. Kusaka, where's the key to this room?

156
00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:06.653
Huh? Here it is.

157
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.453
Mr. Mouri, how is my husband?

158
00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:19.153
Mrs. Kusaka, please call the police.

159
00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:21.553
Your husband has been killed.

160
00:10:23.653 --> 00:10:25.253
Mrs. Kusaka!

161
00:10:25.253 --> 00:10:26.853
Mrs. Kusaka, please get a hold of yourself!

162
00:10:26.853 --> 00:10:28.053
Mrs. Kusaka!

163
00:10:28.053 --> 00:10:29.953
Why?

164
00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:34.153
Why is he lying on the ground in such an unnatural position?

165
00:10:34.153 --> 00:10:35.553
Why?

166
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:48.961
The victim is Shohei Kusaka, age 52.

167
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:53.561
He is the man of this house and runs a financial institution.

168
00:10:53.561 --> 00:10:56.861
The cause of death is suffocation

169
00:10:56.861 --> 00:10:58.661
due to strangulation by the rope

170
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:01.761
that was found around his neck.

171
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:04.261
Can you explain the circumstances when you found the body?

172
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.361
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:08.861
Since Mr. Kusaka didn't come back for quite a while,

174
00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:12.461
I came here to check on him together with Mrs. Kusaka.

175
00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:15.761
Then, we found him lying on his back on the floor.

176
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.561
What about the door, was it locked?

177
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:21.061
Yes.

178
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:23.061
Inspector!

179
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:24.561
Mrs. Kusaka told me

180
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:27.261
that these are the keys that Mr. Kusaka had on him.

181
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:30.561
It's the key to the wine cellar and to the house.

182
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:33.061
The door of the wine cellar are auto-locks,

183
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:36.961
and the only ones who had both keys were Mr. and Mrs. Kusaka.

184
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:39.561
She's says there are no other spare keys.

185
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:42.661
So, the door are auto-locks.

186
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:46.561
Officer Tome, how's the window over there?

187
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:49.361
Nothing here.

188
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.561
There is dust accumulated on the dust shelf

189
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.861
and there are no traces of anyone having broken in from outside.

190
00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.261
Besides, as you can see,

191
00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:01.261
the handle on this window is on the inside.

192
00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:02.761
So, it would be extremely difficult to access the window

193
00:12:02.761 --> 00:12:05.261
from the outside.

194
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:07.661
Moreover, look there.

195
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.261
That's an alarm system,

196
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.561
so if the window is forced open,

197
00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:17.261
the alarm system is set to go off immediately.

198
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:21.461
The switch to that alarm system is this.

199
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:22.761
When you push the switch of the remote control

200
00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:25.661
that is attached to the keys.

201
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.561
The alarm system is turned off

202
00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:29.961
and the window can be opened.

203
00:12:29.961 --> 00:12:32.261
And when the window is closed again,

204
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:35.461
the alarm system switches back on.

205
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:36.761
I see.

206
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:40.461
It'd be impossible for the killer to go in and out of that window.

207
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:41.661
If so,

208
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:45.661
we can narrow down the killer quite a bit, right, Inspector?

209
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:50.461
I mean, the killer is an acquaintance of Mr. Kusaka.

210
00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:54.361
The person probably had Mr. Kusaka himself open the door

211
00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:56.561
and came into the wine cellar.

212
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:59.761
Then, committed the murder.

213
00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:03.461
Wine bottles were probably cracked and lying around Mr. Kusaka

214
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:06.361
beause the killer and Mr. Kusaka had a fist fight or something?

215
00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:07.561
Most likely.

216
00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:10.661
But wouldn't that be sort of strange, too?

217
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:12.661
Take a look over here.

218
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:16.861
The wine bottles on the very top of the low shelf are toppled.

219
00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:18.061
But there's nothing's wrong with the wine bottles

220
00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:20.561
on the shelves on this side.

221
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:22.761
If they really had a fist fight in a clustered place like this,

222
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.461
wouldn't everything be more messed up?

223
00:13:25.461 --> 00:13:28.261
I see. That's quite true.

224
00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:35.361
It's just coincidence!

225
00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:38.761
What are these traces on the floor?

226
00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:40.361
The two traces seem to have been made by

227
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.061
rubbing something strongly against the floor.

228
00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:45.961
Inspector, let's go

229
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:48.361
and take a look at the back of the house.

230
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.561
If there are no traces of anyone having come in

231
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:51.561
-Wait a second. -from the back door,

232
00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:52.861
somebody in this house is the killer.

233
00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:54.461
Maybe...

234
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.161
There are no traces of the back door

235
00:13:58.161 --> 00:14:00.661
having been broken into.

236
00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:05.361
Maybe a spare key was secretly made...

237
00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:08.961
Oh, I think that is unthinkable.

238
00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:10.261
What do you mean?

239
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:11.561
The keys of this house

240
00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:14.561
are all special electronic keys.

241
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:17.261
An electronic key is not something

242
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.161
that you can easily have made in a hardware store in town.

243
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:21.261
You can't make a spare

244
00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.561
unless you place an order to the manufacturer.

245
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:25.361
Now, it's pretty much definite that the killer

246
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.261
is someone who is within the premises.

247
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:31.661
Where are the people of this house and the guests?

248
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:34.161
I have them waiting in the living room.

249
00:14:34.161 --> 00:14:36.761
Okay, let's go hear them out.

250
00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:42.861
Hey, Conan!

251
00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:45.161
Just what do you think you're doing up there?

252
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:47.661
Oh, well...

253
00:14:47.661 --> 00:14:49.761
I'm just practicing the horizontal bar.

254
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:50.861
What?

255
00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:52.561
Inspector!

256
00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:54.661
What's the matter, Officer Chiba?

257
00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:56.661
We got a report from the identification officers just now saying

258
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:57.761
that they found two pairs of fingerprints

259
00:14:57.761 --> 00:15:01.661
other than Mr. Kusaka's and Mrs. Kusaka on the wine cellar's door.

260
00:15:01.661 --> 00:15:04.761
One was that of Yukari Takano, a guest at the party.

261
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:07.561
And the other one of Jyokichi Tonomura.

262
00:15:07.561 --> 00:15:09.061
What?

263
00:15:09.061 --> 00:15:11.061
Okay, let's go to the living room.

264
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:12.161
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir.

265
00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.261
Officer Chiba. Take care of Conan, will you?

266
00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:15.261
Yes, sir!

267
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:17.161
What?

268
00:15:17.161 --> 00:15:18.561
Hey...

269
00:15:22.961 --> 00:15:25.361
Officer Chiba.

270
00:15:25.361 --> 00:15:27.661
What is it, Conan?

271
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:29.161
You know...

272
00:15:31.961 --> 00:15:36.161
I haven't heard that something like that has been found.

273
00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:38.061
Have you heard anything, Officer Tome?

274
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:40.361
No, I haven't heard of any such report.

275
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:45.061
I've found the conclusive evidence.

276
00:15:45.061 --> 00:15:46.661
I'm sure the killer still has it

277
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:48.961
because the killer haven't been able to throw it away.

278
00:15:48.961 --> 00:15:50.461
What?

279
00:15:50.461 --> 00:15:53.661
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

280
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.361
Please give us a decent explanation, Inspector!

281
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:58.361
I'm saying that judging from the circumstances at the scene,

282
00:15:58.361 --> 00:16:00.561
it is most likely that someone in this house

283
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:03.961
had committed the murder.

284
00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:07.061
That goes for you two in particular, Mr. Tonomura and Ms. Takano.

285
00:16:07.061 --> 00:16:08.761
Both of your fingerprints

286
00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:12.561
were found on the door of the wine cellar.

287
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:14.561
Hey, hold it there, will you?

288
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:17.261
I did go to the wine cellar!

289
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:19.761
To ask him to loan me more money.

290
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:22.661
But I didn't go inside!

291
00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:24.761
How about you, Ms. Takano?

292
00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:27.061
I went to the wine cellar to ask him

293
00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:29.161
to extend the period of which to repay my loan,

294
00:16:29.161 --> 00:16:31.061
but I didn't go inside either!

295
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:35.061
What about you, Mr. Nonaka?

296
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.161
Huh?

297
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.161
After Mr. Kusaka left the room,

298
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:40.261
I was strolling around the yard.

299
00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:42.861
So, I haven't gone to the wine cellar.

300
00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:44.861
I see.

301
00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:47.461
Where were you, Mrs. Kusaka?

302
00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:50.361
I was in the kitchen the whole time.

303
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:52.161
In order to go to the wine cellar,

304
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:53.561
I had to come through this living room

305
00:16:53.561 --> 00:16:56.561
where Mr. Mouri and everyone else were.

306
00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:59.861
I was seated at the table of the living room all the while,

307
00:16:59.861 --> 00:17:02.861
but Mrs. Kusaka never left the living room.

308
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.561
Hey, Pops.

309
00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:09.061
I found something strange in the wine cellar.

310
00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:11.361
Something strange?

311
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:18.461
Hey, Conan. Where is that strange stuff?

312
00:17:21.661 --> 00:17:24.061
I'd like you to call my lawyer!

313
00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:27.061
Right! I won't say a word until then!

314
00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:30.361
Now, now. Please calm down.

315
00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:33.061
Excuse me for a moment.

316
00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:36.661
Hello, Megure here.

317
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:40.861
What? You've figured out who the killer is?

318
00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:49.761
Everyone, let me explain.

319
00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:53.261
How this ruthless murder was committed

320
00:17:53.261 --> 00:17:55.261
and disclosed who did it, too.

321
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:57.361
Just a while ago, I mentioned that

322
00:17:57.361 --> 00:18:01.061
the killer is among the three people here.

323
00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:04.361
There is no doubt about that!

324
00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:05.561
What?

325
00:18:05.561 --> 00:18:09.961
First, the two whose fingerprints were found on the door.

326
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:12.861
Mr. Tonomura and Ms. Takano.

327
00:18:12.861 --> 00:18:15.361
They are not the killers.

328
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.661
Hey, then are you saying that the killer is not here?

329
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.361
No, the killer is here.

330
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:25.261
The killer is here? Then...

331
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:26.261
Yes!

332
00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:29.761
The killer is you, Mr. Nonaka!

333
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:34.361
Wait a minute.

334
00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:36.961
I was in the yard at that time.

335
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:40.161
I didn't even go near the wine cellar!

336
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.661
Shall we replay the situation then?

337
00:18:43.661 --> 00:18:46.861
First, you went around to the backyard,

338
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.461
and knocked on the window of the wine cellar.

339
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:54.761
Oh, I forgot to mention the role of the killer

340
00:18:54.761 --> 00:18:58.361
will be played by Officer Chiba.

341
00:18:58.361 --> 00:19:01.561
Then, Mr. Kusaku turned off the alarm system

342
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:03.561
and opened the window.

343
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:05.061
Officer Takagi!

344
00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.361
Yes?

345
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:08.161
Please play the role of the victim.

346
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.261
Yes, sir.

347
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:20.461
Then, Mr. Nonaka lured Mr. Kusaku out into the yard.

348
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:23.661
Saying something like you would explain what trick

349
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:25.961
Mr. Tonomura used during the wine tasting.

350
00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:32.261
Mr. Nonaka killed Mr. Kusaku in the backyard when he was off guard.

351
00:19:32.261 --> 00:19:33.361
Then Mr. Nonaka went to the backdoor to lock the door

352
00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:34.661
with the keys he took,

353
00:19:34.661 --> 00:19:38.061
and then put the keys back into the victim's pocket.

354
00:19:38.061 --> 00:19:39.561
Wait, Mr. Mouri.

355
00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:43.561
Then how did he put Mr. Kusaku into the wine cellar?

356
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:45.561
Even if he were to throw him in from the window,

357
00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:49.261
wouldn't it be impossible to Iie him down in the center of the cellar?

358
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:52.361
He used the clothes rack pole!

359
00:19:52.361 --> 00:19:54.061
The clothes rack pole?

360
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:57.961
Mr. Nonaka lined two poles up together

361
00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:00.961
and laid the dead body on it like so.

362
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:04.061
He pulled the pole through Mr. Kusaku's belt

363
00:20:04.061 --> 00:20:07.461
to keep the space between the poles from widening.

364
00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:11.261
Then he pushed the poles through the window

365
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:13.261
and if you tilt the angle...

366
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:17.361
I see!

367
00:20:17.361 --> 00:20:20.061
The wine bottles broke when Mr. Kusaku's legs

368
00:20:20.061 --> 00:20:22.061
knocked them off the shelf!

369
00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:24.661
Finally, the pole is pulled out.

370
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:29.561
It is similar to the time Mr. Kusaku was found,

371
00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.061
what about the window?

372
00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:34.861
He hooked a narrow wire or something on the tab of the window

373
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:36.661
then pulled on it with all his might.

374
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:39.961
It closed.

375
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:43.461
In this way, it is possible to lie Mr. Kusaku on the floor

376
00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:47.461
between the shelves without coming into the wine cellar.

377
00:20:47.461 --> 00:20:48.761
That's all a bunch of baloney!

378
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.961
Do you have evidence?

379
00:20:51.961 --> 00:20:55.561
Would you be so kind to show me your handkerchief?

380
00:20:55.561 --> 00:21:00.261
The one with your initials on them that Mr. Kusaku gave you.

381
00:21:00.261 --> 00:21:04.561
When Mr. Kusaku was dropped, some wine bottles broke.

382
00:21:04.561 --> 00:21:08.161
Wine would then naturally splatter onto the poles.

383
00:21:08.161 --> 00:21:12.061
But no wine was found on the poles.

384
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:16.461
That's because you wiped off the wine

385
00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:18.261
to hide your trick of having used the poles.

386
00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:21.061
Since you didn't expect the wine bottles to break,

387
00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:23.261
you wiped it off with the handkerchief you had.

388
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:26.561
I'm sure you still have it with you

389
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:28.561
because if you threw it away,

390
00:21:28.561 --> 00:21:31.361
it would be obvious that it's yours.

391
00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:34.961
Darn it!

392
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.461
He's... he's the one to blame!

393
00:21:37.461 --> 00:21:39.461
He lends money and demands ridiculously high interest.

394
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:41.261
Then, when it becomes inconvenient for him,

395
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:42.861
he demands that you pay him back the next day!

396
00:21:42.861 --> 00:21:46.661
You've got to be kidding! I've got employees to feed, too!

397
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:48.561
That's why I did for the sake of everyone else!

398
00:21:48.561 --> 00:21:50.661
You fool!

399
00:21:50.661 --> 00:21:53.961
No matter what your reasons are, murder is murder!

400
00:21:53.961 --> 00:21:57.961
You can't look away from the fact that you took someone's life!

401
00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:01.161
Think deeply about it.

402
00:23:36.261 --> 00:23:38.461
Thank you for the good job, Mr. Mouri!

403
00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:40.261
Yes, thank you.

404
00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:41.761
Yes. You, too.

405
00:23:41.761 --> 00:23:45.761
Mr. Mouri, I'll make it up to you one of these days.

406
00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:51.461
Did I lend him something?

407
00:23:51.461 --> 00:23:54.061
Oh, well...

408
00:23:54.061 --> 00:23:56.661
You can take your time paying me back!

409
00:23:57.661 --> 00:23:59.261
It hurts.

410
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:03.261
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

411
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.461

412
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:09.161
Could you please take a picture of us two?

413
00:24:09.161 --> 00:24:10.861
Gosh.

414
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:12.061
Here goes!

415
00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:23.461
What? Hold on!

416
00:24:24.461 --> 00:24:26.561
Madoka, this is Mouri!

417
00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:29.161
Where and in what condition is the body?

418
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:31.161
