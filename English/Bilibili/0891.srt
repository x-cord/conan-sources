1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,540
Pops received a letter from a mysterious person

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,940
named Komakichi Kurataya saying he wanted to give him a family treasure.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,640
Ran and I decided to accompany him to Yamaguchi Prefecture.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,040
"I'll be waiting in front of the large fox"

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,540
"at the Yuda Hot Springs Station at 3 PM."

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,640
"Komakichi Kurataya"?

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,140
This must be a rather substantial treasure!

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,640
Dad, keep your voice down!

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,640
Sorry for all the noise.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,240
Seriously.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,040
"JR Shin-Yamaguchi Station" -We're here, Yamaguchi!

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,640
We still have plenty of time until 3 PM.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,840
Then let's do some sightseeing.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,240
Yamaguchi has lots to see,

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,840
like historic landmarks from the late Edo and restoration periods,

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,140
and Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,640
Sorry.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,640
You were just so beautiful, I couldn't help myself.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
Are you Kogoro Mouri?

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,040
What?

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,340
You're The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,840
It's an honor to run into you here.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,940
Thank you.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm...

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,940
"Asuka Natsume (28)" -Asuka Natsume.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,740
"News Site Reporter" -I'm with the Yamaguchi News Site.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,240
Yamaguchi News Site?

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,840
We report local news stories online.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Have you come to Yamaguchi to investigate a case?

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,740
Well, actually...

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,440
Dad!

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,840
Didn't the letter demand strict secrecy?

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,940
Oh, right.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm just here to sightseeing.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,940
My daughter, Ran, and this kid insisted I bring them.

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,440
Sightseeing?

37
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,340
In that case, let me show you around.

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,340
-What? Are you sure? -Yes.

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,940
I appreciate it.

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,040
This'll be a fun trip.

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,440
He can never resist a beautiful woman.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,040
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,940
A beautiful reporter and the treasure of Yamaguchi.

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,740
There's no way this can end well.

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,940
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:19,098
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour (Yamaguchi Part)"

50
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:20,298
"Kozan Park"

51
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,398
During the Muromachi period,

52
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:26,898
Yamaguchi was even more prosperous than Kyoto.

53
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:30,398
It's also known as "Nishinokyo", or the Kyoto of the West.

54
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:31,898
A five-story pagoda.

55
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:35,798
That's the Rurikoji Temple five-story pagoda,

56
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:38,498
"Rurikoji Five-story Pagoda" -one of Japan's three greatest pagodas,

57
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:41,098
along with the ones at Horyuji and Daigoji.

58
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:42,898
It lights up at night.

59
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,198
It's a beautiful sight.

60
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,398
It certainly is beautiful.

61
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:48,598
Hey.

62
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:52,498
"Chinryutei" -This is the relocated and reconstructed Chinryutei,

63
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:53,498
the detached cottage of the Abe family,

64
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:55,198
a late Edo period business magnate.

65
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,798
In this room, men like Takamori Saigo and Takayoshi

66
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,798
held secret meetings regarding the Satcho Alliance.

67
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:04,298
I see.

68
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:07,198
In this tiny room?

69
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,598
Standing in this room

70
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:12,698
makes you feel like a patriot of the Meiji Restoration.

71
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,298
Mr. Mouri.

72
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:17,998
What are your plans for this evening?

73
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:22,598
I'm supposed to meet someone named Komakichi Kurataya.

74
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,598
Komakichi Kurataya?

75
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:25,798
Dad!

76
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,998
Oh, my bad.

77
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:31,798
Excuse me. Could you wait here, please?

78
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,398
What? Sure.

79
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,098
What's gotten into her?

80
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:39,598
She must've remembered she had something to do.

81
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:46,598
Asuka's taking a long time.

82
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:47,798
Yeah.

83
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:50,898
She's back.

84
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:56,798
Kogoro Mouri, right?

85
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,798
That's me. Who are you?

86
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:04,398
"Nobuto Washiyama (46)" -I'm Washiyama of the Yamaguchikita Station.

87
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,198
"Hiroshi Tsurumi (27)" -I'm Tsurumi.

88
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:07,498
The police?

89
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,398
We have a few questions for you.

90
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:11,998
Could you come down to the station with us?

91
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,098
What?

92
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,998
Hey! What are you doing?

93
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,298
-Dad! -Pops.

94
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:22,198
He's running!

95
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,198
Kogoro Mouri, you're not getting away!

96
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:28,598
You're under arrest!

97
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,198
What?

98
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,198
"Yamaguchikita Station"

99
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:33,698
I don't understand!

100
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:37,098
Why am I being arrested?

101
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,198
Don't just stand there! Explain yourselves!

102
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:52,598
"Tetsuya Takajo (38)" -I'm Chief Inspector Takajo.

103
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:55,498
You will be investigated.

104
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,498
What am I being arrested for?

105
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:59,998
Interference of public duties.

106
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:02,598
You tried to flee the scene.

107
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:05,098
I wasn't trying to run!

108
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:09,298
I heard you're receiving a family treasure from Komakichi Kurataya.

109
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,398
What?

110
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:14,298
Komakichi Kurataya is the suspect in an armed robbery

111
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,598
that occurred a year ago.

112
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,298
Armed robbery?

113
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:20,198
Using the name Komakichi Kurataya,

114
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:24,998
a shipping agent of Hagi famous during the Edo period,

115
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:28,698
he entered Japanese-style cafe "Takarada" with a gun,

116
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:35,398
shot the manager, and stole millions of yen worth of Kiecho coins.

117
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:40,298
Komakichi Kurata's family treasure refers to those coins he stole.

118
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:45,398
In other words, you're working with Komakichi.

119
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,998
You can't be serious!

120
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,598
I was just told to come here by letter!

121
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:50,998
I see.

122
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:53,198
Let's see this letter.

123
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,198
You just wait.

124
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:55,898
I'll show you right now.

125
00:07:58,598 --> 00:07:59,598
What?

126
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,798
What's wrong?

127
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:04,898
A detective must respect his clients' confidentiality.

128
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:07,198
If you want to see it, bring me a warrant.

129
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,198
Search him!

130
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:10,498
- Hey, stop! Don't touch me! -What should we do, Conan?

131
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:11,898
If we don't do something,

132
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:13,998
they'll think he's working with a robber.

133
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:18,698
We should have Inspector Megure contact the Yamaguchi police.

134
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,898
Wait, officers!

135
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:22,598
Asuka.

136
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:24,298
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

137
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:27,898
I'm the one who reported you to the police.

138
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:28,998
What?

139
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:33,798
I was worried you'd get caught up in the case.

140
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:38,998
I wanted the police to protect you from Komakichi.

141
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:41,998
So that's what happened.

142
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:44,798
We're sorry, Mr. Mouri.

143
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:45,898
As long as you understand.

144
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:48,198
Everyone makes mistakes some...

145
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,298
Hey, wait!

146
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,598
If you arrested me,

147
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:57,698
you must not be making much progress on the robbery investigation.

148
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,298
So, what?

149
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,298
Relax.

150
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:06,298
Why don't I, The Great Kogoro Mouri, assist you?

151
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,898
Just because I'm a great detective,

152
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,798
there's no need to be shy.

153
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,798
There he goes again.

154
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:17,198
What can a mere detective do?

155
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,298
A mere detective?

156
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:23,098
Investigating the robbery is the police's job.

157
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:26,898
It's not something an incompetent detective should involve himself in.

158
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:29,698
Have some of Yamaguchi's famous Kawara Soba Noodles,

159
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:32,598
and go back to Tokyo.

160
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,198
That half-wit cop.

161
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:40,498
Don't underestimate The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

162
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,498
"JR Yuda Hot Springs Station"

163
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,798
"JR Yuda Hot Springs Station" -The letter said

164
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:46,998
he'd be waiting in front of this statue at three, right?

165
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:51,098
We missed our chance to discover the identity of Komakichi Kurataya.

166
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,198
Too bad.

167
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:53,498
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:56,298
It's my fault for reporting it.

169
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,598
It's not your fault, Asuka.

170
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,398
It's the fault of that half-wit Takajo.

171
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:06,898
Anyway, where did the letter from Komakichi go?

172
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,698
Oh, that?

173
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:10,398
I have it.

174
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:11,998
See?

175
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:13,498
When did you get this?

176
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:18,398
It seemed important, so I thought I should hold onto it.

177
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,598
"Fox's Footprint Hot Springs"

178
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:25,498
But did the robber Komakichi really write that letter?

179
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:29,798
-What? -Don't you think it's weird

180
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:32,798
for a robber to ask you to come here?

181
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,698
"Fox's Footprint Hot Springs" -You're right.

182
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:37,898
What was his plan?

183
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:42,698
You'd probably have to ask Komakichi for the answer.

184
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,698
Right, Asuka?

185
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:47,898
What?

186
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:53,298
You're Komakichi Kurataya, aren't you?

187
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:56,498
What? Don't be stupid.

188
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:00,098
How could Asuka be the robber?

189
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:13,165
How could Asuka be the robber?

190
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,765
That's not what I meant.

191
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:22,965
Asuka sent you the letter under the name Komakichi Kurataya.

192
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,365
Hey, kid!

193
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,065
You're talking nonsense!

194
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:33,565
But you only said the name Komakichi Kurataya to Asuka.

195
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:40,165
But Inspector Takajo knew about him giving you his family treasure.

196
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,765
Since I had the letter the whole time,

197
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:48,665
Inspector Takajo couldn't have known about that.

198
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:53,765
Which means he must have heard it from Asuka when she reported you.

199
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:54,765
I'm sorry!

200
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,565
What?

201
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,465
Conan is right.

202
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,565
Asuka, what is the meaning of this?

203
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:04,865
Someone's actually been arrested

204
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:07,765
for the robbery that happened a year ago.

205
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:09,365
An accomplice?

206
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:10,465
No.

207
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:14,365
A metalworking researcher named Yuichi Fukuhara.

208
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,865
Metalworking?

209
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:16,865
Yes.

210
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,265
He received a request by email

211
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:23,465
"Yuichi Fukuhara (32)" -from someone calling themselves

212
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,865
"Metalworking Researcher" -Komakichi Kurataya.

213
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:29,865
He asked him to recreate a weapon of the Choshu Domain,

214
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,465
to commemorate the Hagi Reverberating Furnace

215
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:33,965
becoming a world heritage site.

216
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,265
Naturally, as a work of art to appreciate

217
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:38,365
without any firing capabilities.

218
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:42,465
However, just before being completed,

219
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:45,865
it was stolen from the factory.

220
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:50,365
And modified so it could fire bullets.

221
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:51,465
Yes.

222
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:54,865
Then Fukuhara did nothing wrong.

223
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:58,465
No. Ultimately they decided what he did was no different

224
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,565
from illegally manufacturing a gun.

225
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:03,965
He received a one year sentence.

226
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:10,365
Just before Fukuhara received the email,

227
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:13,965
I did a story on his factory in Hagi

228
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,165
and posted it on my news site.

229
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,965
The culprit must have seen that

230
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,865
and asked Fukuhara to create the gun.

231
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:26,465
So I'm responsible, too.

232
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:27,665
I see.

233
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:31,265
But you should've been honest from the start.

234
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:33,665
Maybe...

235
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:38,765
Asuka knows who the culprit is.

236
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:41,965
Isn't that why you quietly invited the old man to Yamaguchi,

237
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:44,665
so the culprit wouldn't find out

238
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:47,465
and got him involved in the case?

239
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,965
Is this true?

240
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:54,965
The culprit is a cold-blooded man who has no problem shooting people.

241
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:59,165
If he learns I asked a detective to investigate,

242
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:03,565
he may try to kill me.

243
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,665
I'm so afraid.

244
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,765
I understand the situation.

245
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:12,965
Asuka, the rest is a detective's job.

246
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,165
Mr. Mouri...

247
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:17,465
Thank you!

248
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,965
No need to thank me.

249
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:22,365
This is a detective's destiny.

250
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:25,665
The case called me here.

251
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:30,265
I know! Asuka, let's announce on your news site

252
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:32,165
that I've taken the case.

253
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:35,365
Then he won't have any reason to kill you.

254
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,865
But you...

255
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,465
Don't worry.

256
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:42,765
Let the great Kogoro Mouri handle it!

257
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:53,165
So you're the famous Kogoro Mouri.

258
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,965
Asuka filled me in.

259
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:59,665
I heard you're going to solve that case from a year ago.

260
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,265
You can count on me.

261
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:07,065
I've solved several cases the police couldn't handle.

262
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,965
Now then, Takarada.

263
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:15,765
The coins were stolen from the storehouse on the second floor, correct?

264
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,065
Yes.

265
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,665
Do you remember the culprit's face?

266
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,665
They were dressed so strangely,

267
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:24,865
that made a stronger impression.

268
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,565
Strange how?

269
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:32,165
I know. They were captured on my webcam.

270
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,465
Your webcam?

271
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,665
Yes.

272
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:38,965
I installed a few in my garage in place of security cameras

273
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:42,065
to prevent anyone from messing with my car.

274
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,465
This is him.

275
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:46,465
A school uniform and white sash?

276
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:50,265
That certainly is a bit eye-catching for a robber.

277
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,665
What? I've seen this outfit before.

278
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:56,465
Ran.

279
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:58,665
Can I see your guidebook?

280
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,865
Sure.

281
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:02,565
-Here. -Thank you.

282
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,465
Found it.

283
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,865
Fujiki. Welcome.

284
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:13,065
You're Kogoro Mouri?

285
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:16,165
Yes. Who are you?

286
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:18,265
"Yosuke Fujiki (45), Lawyer" -Fujiki, a lawyer.

287
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,465
I've been responsible for managing the family's assets

288
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:22,465
since previous owner.

289
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,665
Fujiki, did something happen today?

290
00:16:24,665 --> 00:16:27,665
I found a news story online claiming that

291
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:31,765
a detective named Kogoro Mouri would be investigating the case.

292
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,965
This is it.

293
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:38,565
Komakichi Kurataya, I hope you're quaking in your boots!

294
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,465
How embarrassing.

295
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:44,065
Mouri, could you stay out of this?

296
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:45,465
Stay out of this?

297
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:48,065
The previous owner willed that the artworks

298
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,265
and knickknacks kept in the storehouse

299
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:54,665
on the second floor should be donated to local institutions.

300
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:58,065
Our work was stopped due to the case,

301
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:01,865
but everything must be removed from the storehouse by next week.

302
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,265
I see.

303
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:06,365
So that's why there was a truck parked outside.

304
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:07,565
Yes.

305
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:10,565
The construction happening next door is so loud.

306
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:15,765
I can hardly run the business from ten in the morning until evening.

307
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:19,165
I'd like the case to be solved soon, too.

308
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,565
Takarada,

309
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:24,465
even if the case is solved, you may not get your coins back.

310
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,565
What?

311
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:29,565
Keicho coins have a nearly 90 percent gold content.

312
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:32,565
If melted down into gold bars,

313
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,165
they could be sold.

314
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:39,365
Fujiki, you seem to know a lot about gold.

315
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:42,765
My job involves managing assets.

316
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,365
Mouri, this is for your own good.

317
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,965
The culprit has a gun.

318
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,765
If you want to live,

319
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,265
you should withdraw immediately.

320
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,665
Are you threatening me?

321
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:58,065
No. It's just a warning.

322
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:01,265
Goodbye.

323
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,965
He's suspicious.

324
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,465
Hey, Pops.

325
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,465
I think there could be a clue

326
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:16,565
"Hagi" -to solving the case in Hagi.

327
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:18,165
Hagi?

328
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,265
Inspector Takajo said Komakichi Kurataya

329
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:25,065
was the name of someone who lived in Hagi during the Edo period.

330
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:30,965
And Asuka said the factory of Fukuhara who made the gun is also...

331
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,065
Keep your mouth shut!

332
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:35,665
The case happened here in Yamaguchi City!

333
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,965
Then can Ran and I go to Hagi?

334
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:40,365
No!

335
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:41,565
Why not?

336
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:44,065
It takes an hour by bus.

337
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:47,565
As long as we're here, I'd like to visit Hagi.

338
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:49,665
It's too dangerous for you to go alone!

339
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:50,965
We'll be fine.

340
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:54,765
Asuka said she's working in Hagi today.

341
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:56,965
What? Asuka is?

342
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:00,165
"Hagi: Meirin Academy"

343
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,965
Hey, kid! Where's Asuka?

344
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:05,765
Asuka's collecting information

345
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,165
"Shoin Shrine" -at Shoin Shrine right now,

346
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:09,265
so we came here first.

347
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:16,065
We wouldn't want to bother her while she's working.

348
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:21,965
By the way, kid, what are you looking for?

349
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,965
What? Oh, you know...

350
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:31,965
There it is!

351
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,465
Haginyan!

352
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:37,465
What's with the costume?

353
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:40,165
It's Haginyan, the mascot of the city of Hagi.

354
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:41,565
Really?

355
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:44,665
Ran, take a picture of me with Haginyan.

356
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:45,865
Sure.

357
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:49,865
Seriously. He's still a little kid.

358
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:54,865
Anyway, that mascot sure is dressed strangely.

359
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:57,765
Dressed strangely...

360
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,165
Strangely...

361
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:08,865
Hey, Haginyan!

362
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,665
Why are you dressed like that?

363
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:16,765
What are you dressed as?

364
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,965
"Kiheitai Haginyan"

365
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,565
The Kiheitai!

366
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:24,865
That's it...

367
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:27,565
The culprit was dressed as Shinsaku Takasugi,

368
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,665
the man who formed the Kiheitai.

369
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,965
But why?

370
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,365
How should I know?

371
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:39,265
But dressing as a local hero to commit a robbery is disgraceful.

372
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:42,165
Hey, kid. Where's Asuka now?

373
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:45,765
She's broadcasting from Takayoshi Kido's former residence.

374
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:47,965
It's within walking distance.

375
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:48,965
"Takayoshi Kido's Former Residence"

376
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:51,565
Along with Takamori Saigo and Toshimichi Okubo,

377
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:55,765
Takayoshi Kido was one of three great nobles of the Meiji Restoration.

378
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:59,865
He lived here for twenty years before moving to Edo.

379
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,565
Hey, Ran.

380
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:06,265
We should probably call Asuka soon.

381
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,365
Yeah.

382
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:11,865
Hello?

383
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:14,065
Asuka, it's Takarada.

384
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,565
I'm calling you by video call.

385
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,265
Oh, sorry.

386
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,265
Hello.

387
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:23,065
How's your day going?

388
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:27,065
Fujiki just came rushing to the shop.

389
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:30,765
He must be flustered since he heard The Great Detective Mouri

390
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:32,565
is investigating the case.

391
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,565
So it was him.

392
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,165
Darn it. We're lost.

393
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,365
It should be around here.

394
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,765
Are you looking for someplace?

395
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:46,465
We're trying to get to Takayoshi Kido's former residence, but we're lost.

396
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:49,465
Oh, that's nearby.

397
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:52,265
I could take you there in my rickshaw.

398
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:54,965
Yes, nice.

399
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:58,765
I'll test its comfort first.

400
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,065
What a nice view.

401
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,665
Ran, get down!

402
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:10,565
Hey, don't touch that!

403
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,565
Hey, what are you...

404
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,965
Hide inside the rickshaw!

405
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,465
What happened?

406
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:24,265
Are you okay, Ran?

407
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:25,265
Yeah.

408
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:30,165
-Is Komakichi Kurataya trying to kill... -Looks like he ran.

409
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,365
Pops?

410
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:59,165
"Next Episode" -With a gun? Are you all right?

411
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,865
Komakichi Kurataya...

412
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:05,265
What's wrong, Asuka?

413
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,565
"Kogoro Mouri, In Call" -Answer me, Asuka!

414
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,965
Asuka!

415
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:10,765
He has a gun.

416
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:12,765
Whatever you do, don't follow me.

417
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,465
Next Conan,

418
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:24,265
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour (Hagi Part)"

419
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:27,508
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,608
"Truck"

421
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:30,908
Yamaguchi is known for?

422
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:31,908
-Sweet rice jelly! -And Hagi?

423
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:33,708
-Bean cakes! -Really?
