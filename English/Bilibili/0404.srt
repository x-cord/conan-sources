1
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.340
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.040
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.540
With the treasure and the girl's smile.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.040
The angel comes down to us at last.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840
It is time for us to get them all.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:59.325
We, the Youth Detective Squad, got a client.

10
00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.925
Her name is Yuriko Matsunaka,

11
00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.125
a student in the other class of our grade.

12
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:04.625
She visited us

13
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.325
because her great-grandfather,

14
00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:10.625
Gozo Isegawa, left a riddle and wanted Yuriko to solve it.

15
00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:12.725
And so,

16
00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:16.625
a mysterious guy named Clock took us

17
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.425
to a place called the Angel's Mansion,

18
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:20.225
to solve the riddle that Gozo Isegawa left behind.

19
00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:28.525
Now it's time.

20
00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:32.525
Here is the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

21
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:33.725
-What? -What?

22
00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:37.825
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

23
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:41.125
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

24
00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.625
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

25
00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:49.625
What are you doing?

26
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.325
That's it! Guys, get off the floor...

27
00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:54.825
Yuriko!

28
00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:05.225
"Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 2)"

29
00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:10.225
"South Angel Tower's Dungeon"

30
00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:15.325
Hey, guys!

31
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:17.325
Are you guys okay?

32
00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:19.325
Yeah, I'm okay.

33
00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.525
Looks like we really fell down.

34
00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:24.225
Genta...

35
00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:26.825
Hey, something's wrong with Genta!

36
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.925
Hey! Genta...

37
00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.925
Another grilled eel, please.

38
00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:38.025
He hasn't slept since last night, right?

39
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:39.325
Genta!

40
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:42.225
There's only 9 hours left until the time limit!

41
00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.325
Where is this? Where are we?

42
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:50.825
Remember what Mr. Clock said?

43
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:56.025
Keep in mind, this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

44
00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:58.425
A labyrinth. A labyrinth?

45
00:03:58.425 --> 00:03:59.825
What do we do?

46
00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:01.525
There's nothing we can do but wait.

47
00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:05.325
No way...

48
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.525
So we can't get out of here?

49
00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:15.025
Mitsuhiko, it's all your fault.

50
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:17.525
What? It's not my fault!

51
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:18.525
Yeah, it is.

52
00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:21.125
It's because you were trying to be cool in front Yuriko.

53
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.225
You're not that kind of guy. You shouldn't have acted like that.

54
00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:24.925
Okay, but you were doing exactly the same thing,

55
00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:28.725
saying "I'm gonna beat Conan", weren't you?

56
00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:30.825
Haibara and Ayumi, you girls were too!

57
00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:32.325
I just...

58
00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:33.825
I just wanted to...

59
00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:35.325
You too, Conan!

60
00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.125
You ran into the Angel's tower, acting all self-righteous!

61
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.725
Isn't that why this happened?

62
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:43.225
You guys should've been waiting outside.

63
00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:44.725
What do you mean by that?

64
00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:48.625
You're saying Yuriko was kidnapped all because of us, not you!

65
00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.725
-You wanna fight? -Why not?

66
00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:56.725
It hurts...

67
00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:04.525
Stop!

68
00:05:04.525 --> 00:05:08.325
Guys, please don't fight! We're all friends, right?

69
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:10.825
Yeah, but they're saying it's all my fault.

70
00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:13.125
Who else is going to get Yuriko back

71
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.425
if the Youth Detective Squad split up?

72
00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:18.125
She's always alone.

73
00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:19.925
Right now, at this moment too.

74
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:24.925
Sorry, I was wrong.

75
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.825
No, I was wrong!

76
00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:27.825
No.

77
00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:29.925
I was wrong.

78
00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:31.525
Did Conan just apologize?

79
00:05:31.525 --> 00:05:32.925
He did.

80
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.625
Well, everything's going be fine!

81
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:38.025
As long as the Youth Detective Squad is together,

82
00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.125
this labyrinth is like nothing, right?

83
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:42.125
Yeah, that's right!

84
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:46.025
It's tough to motivate kids, isn't it?

85
00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:47.725
Shut up.

86
00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:49.125
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

87
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:50.225
Yes?

88
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:53.925
You found human bones in the East Mansion, right?

89
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.825
Which direction was the head facing?

90
00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:57.125
The direction?

91
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.725
Let me think.

92
00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.325
Here's the south,

93
00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:03.825
and I went into the East Mansion one like this, so...

94
00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:05.225
It's facing that way.

95
00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.325
The dead man was lying on his stomach, facing the fireplace.

96
00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:13.825
I guess that's where the thieves ended up, like Mr. Clock said.

97
00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:15.825
When a man falls down on his stomach,

98
00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.425
the head shows where he was heading.

99
00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.925
Mitsuhiko already saw that the fireplace

100
00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:23.325
was connected to where the bones were.

101
00:06:23.325 --> 00:06:27.625
So, this labyrinth should lead us at least to the East Mansion.

102
00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:30.425
Great! You're my man!

103
00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:34.725
Yeah, but more important is how we get there

104
00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:36.525
before we become bones, right?

105
00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:38.725
The labyrinth of Minotaur.

106
00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:39.725
What?

107
00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:41.425
Hey, remember?

108
00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:46.225
The half-man half bull monster in front of the mansion.

109
00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:47.625
In the ancient Greek myths,

110
00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:51.925
Minotaur is a son of a king, who incurred the God's displeasure,

111
00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:54.725
and the God made Minotaur half-human half-bull.

112
00:06:54.725 --> 00:06:58.125
Since Minotaur became awfully violent as he grew up,

113
00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:01.325
the king decided to put him in a huge labyrinth,

114
00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:03.025
so he could never come out.

115
00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:05.725
So that monster is somewhere in this labyrinth?

116
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.225
Come on. No.

117
00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:12.625
What's important is after that.

118
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:19.725
Every year, the king sent seven Athenian kids to the labyrinth as tribute.

119
00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:22.325
When the hero of Athens, Theseus, heard of this,

120
00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:25.925
he went to challenge the labyrinth and defeated the Minotaur.

121
00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:29.125
He returned from that so-called "Labyrinth of No Return".

122
00:07:30.725 --> 00:07:32.325
By using a ball of string.

123
00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:33.525
-A ball of string? -A ball of strings?

124
00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:35.525
A ball of string?

125
00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.325
Right. He tied the string to the gate of the labyrinth,

126
00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:41.225
and pulled it while walking inside.

127
00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:44.725
On the way back, all he needed was to follow the string.

128
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.425
I see.

129
00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.825
Then, we should do the same thing

130
00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:50.425
Yeah, we should.

131
00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:53.225
You ladies do not have to do it.

132
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:54.225
Right, Conan?

133
00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:55.325
Right.

134
00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:25.825
Hey look, I think we passed here once already!

135
00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:29.725
Okay, then I think we should've turned right on that corner, not left.

136
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:34.225
You're all right, Mitsuhiko?

137
00:08:34.225 --> 00:08:35.825
Don't you worry.

138
00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:38.025
I wouldn't catch a cold such an important time.

139
00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:52.525
Don't know if this is enough, the yarns.

140
00:08:52.525 --> 00:08:55.725
Well, I think it's showing how close we got to the exit.

141
00:08:55.725 --> 00:08:57.425
Let me help you guys!

142
00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:15.225
Sorry, guys.

143
00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:16.725
Don't worry, man!

144
00:09:16.725 --> 00:09:19.325
Our job is to find a way to get out of here.

145
00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.325
Your job is to solve the riddle, so just keep thinking.

146
00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:23.525
Genta.

147
00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:29.725
That's right! Every man has his own specialty, right?

148
00:09:29.725 --> 00:09:31.125
Mitsuhiko.

149
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:32.525
You guys...

150
00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:37.625
-What's wrong? -The time is over now, isn't it?

151
00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:41.225
No, I just solved the second riddle. But...

152
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:42.925
Hey, guys, look!

153
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:45.025
There, that guy.

154
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:47.525
It's just straight up ahead!

155
00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.325
"East Mansion" -We're save.

156
00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:00.725
That was scary.

157
00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:06.425
Yuriko!

158
00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:08.125
-What? -What?

159
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:10.225
Yuriko, are you all right? Are you hurt?

160
00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:11.525
You jerk!

161
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:14.325
You planned to kidnap her from the beginning, didn't you?

162
00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:15.425
Certainly not.

163
00:10:15.425 --> 00:10:19.725
I just kept Ms. Yuriko away from the pitfall. That's all.

164
00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:25.725
I just screamed because he grabbed my arms all of a sudden.

165
00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.825
I'm so sorry for causing you trouble.

166
00:10:27.825 --> 00:10:31.025
I really don't know what to say.

167
00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:34.325
Actually, it was pretty fun, wasn't it?

168
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:35.325
Oh, yes.

169
00:10:35.325 --> 00:10:38.725
It was just like a little adventure, you know.

170
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.625
Right, Conan?

171
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:42.325
Yeah, it was.

172
00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:51.025
Edogawa, I remember you were saying you solve the second riddle.

173
00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:53.925
Yeah. But we got only three hours or so.

174
00:10:53.925 --> 00:10:55.725
We can no longer see the treasures.

175
00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:57.225
-Why not? -Why not?

176
00:10:57.225 --> 00:10:58.325
"The tail becomes the head"

177
00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:00.025
is telling us to head towards that direction, which is north.

178
00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:03.225
And also, "rat" means midnight.

179
00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:06.525
So in order to open the North Angel Tower,

180
00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:09.425
we have to wait until midnight tonight,

181
00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:11.925
but our challenge ends at 9 pm tonight.

182
00:11:11.925 --> 00:11:13.325
No way!

183
00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:19.425
Mr. Clock, you knew the answer of the first part of the riddle, right?

184
00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:20.425
What?

185
00:11:20.425 --> 00:11:21.625
That's why you just saved Yuriko

186
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.625
and let the rest of us fall into the pitfall

187
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:25.925
after finding the black crystal.

188
00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:29.825
No. You planned to get in our way, didn't you?

189
00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:32.525
Less than 3 hours left,

190
00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.725
I'm still hoping from my heart that you to solve the riddle.

191
00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:51.147
"North Mansion"

192
00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:56.847
Here.

193
00:12:01.347 --> 00:12:03.447
One more hour left.

194
00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:06.047
There must be a way to open the gate

195
00:12:06.047 --> 00:12:07.847
of the North Angel Tower somehow.

196
00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:11.147
Everyone is trying hard.

197
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.647
Think...

198
00:12:14.747 --> 00:12:18.247
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

199
00:12:18.247 --> 00:12:20.747
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

200
00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:23.247
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

201
00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:29.947
The angel is scary.

202
00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:34.247
No way.

203
00:12:34.247 --> 00:12:35.647
But if it's true, then...

204
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.447
I see. Now I get it!

205
00:12:46.447 --> 00:12:47.647
A ladder!

206
00:12:47.647 --> 00:12:49.047
Somebody, get me a ladder!

207
00:12:52.747 --> 00:12:54.547
Excuse me, where's a ladder?

208
00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:58.147
You need it at the North Angel Tower, the direction of "rat", right?

209
00:12:58.147 --> 00:13:00.447
No, I need it in the East Angel. East!

210
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:01.547
East?

211
00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:18.747
"East Angel Tower"

212
00:13:22.147 --> 00:13:24.647
-Be careful, Conan! -Good luck!

213
00:13:45.547 --> 00:13:46.647
As I thought.

214
00:13:48.347 --> 00:13:50.947
The wait is over. Here comes the flute!

215
00:13:58.447 --> 00:14:01.447
Now, what am I going to see

216
00:14:01.447 --> 00:14:04.747
when this light hits the Angel in the direction of "rat".

217
00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:10.647
An angel will come down and play the flute of the black crystal

218
00:14:10.647 --> 00:14:12.847
to show us the treasures.

219
00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:29.947
Hey, it's over there.

220
00:14:29.947 --> 00:14:32.447
An angel has come down to the forest!

221
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:34.447
-What? -Are you serious?

222
00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:35.747
It's the shadow.

223
00:14:35.747 --> 00:14:37.747
The shadow of the angel, playing the flute!

224
00:14:37.747 --> 00:14:40.447
"The song of the angel is my very treasure", right?

225
00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.447
It's on the hill where the charcoal burner's lodge is.

226
00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:46.347
That's where "the song of angel" came down!

227
00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:49.847
I got it! We still got 30 minutes.

228
00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.647
Now let's go!

229
00:14:53.547 --> 00:14:55.047
Mr. Clock?

230
00:15:03.947 --> 00:15:06.547
It is Yuriko's treasure!

231
00:15:06.547 --> 00:15:09.247
You're an adult. Good adults don't steal things!

232
00:15:09.247 --> 00:15:10.847
Mr. Clock.

233
00:15:10.847 --> 00:15:13.047
No, it's not that. Yuri...

234
00:15:15.747 --> 00:15:18.047
Do not interrupt me. There's no time.

235
00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:35.047
Oh, no!

236
00:15:35.047 --> 00:15:37.147
No more labyrinth, please!

237
00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:52.947
-I can't see! -I can't see!

238
00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:57.047
This is Mr. Gozo Isegawa's,

239
00:15:57.047 --> 00:16:00.247
Yuriko's great-grandfather's treasures, isn't it?

240
00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:03.947
What is that?

241
00:16:06.047 --> 00:16:08.947
The game is over, Mr. Clock.

242
00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:11.347
Tell us the truth.

243
00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:14.847
I know you were trying to get these treasures from the beginning.

244
00:16:14.847 --> 00:16:16.147
You were Mr. Isegawa's secretary.

245
00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:18.047
You heard and solved the all the riddles

246
00:16:18.047 --> 00:16:19.947
before anybody else, right?

247
00:16:19.947 --> 00:16:21.147
Solved everything...

248
00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:25.447
Yeah, but in the same way as I did, in the wrong way.

249
00:16:25.447 --> 00:16:28.747
The fact that he told us the riddles in the evening shows that.

250
00:16:28.747 --> 00:16:31.547
I'm sorry but it's not time yet.

251
00:16:31.547 --> 00:16:33.547
If he presents the riddle at 9 pm,

252
00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:35.047
the challenger has to wait until the noon of the next day,

253
00:16:35.047 --> 00:16:37.847
to get into the North Angel Tower.

254
00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:39.247
When the challenger realized the second question,

255
00:16:39.247 --> 00:16:42.847
in which he has to go into the North Angel Tower

256
00:16:42.847 --> 00:16:45.847
But the earliest he can get into the Tower is the midnight of that day.

257
00:16:45.847 --> 00:16:47.247
So no matter how hard you try,

258
00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:50.047
there's no way you can break it within 24 hours.

259
00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:52.547
No! It wasn't me...

260
00:16:52.547 --> 00:16:55.747
But if he really wanted the treasure,

261
00:16:55.747 --> 00:16:59.247
he could've tried his deduction

262
00:16:59.247 --> 00:17:01.147
and realized the flaw in the riddle, don't you think?

263
00:17:01.147 --> 00:17:05.547
Sure he could, but he didn't.

264
00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:08.647
Because it would be a crime if he snatched the treasure!

265
00:17:08.647 --> 00:17:12.247
He wanted to have the treasure officially.

266
00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:14.047
Officially...

267
00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:15.747
What I'm trying to say is

268
00:17:15.747 --> 00:17:18.947
he is the one with the 18th right of inheritance.

269
00:17:21.247 --> 00:17:24.947
It makes sense that he was watching us, interfering with us,

270
00:17:24.947 --> 00:17:27.047
erasing all the clues the previous challengers left,

271
00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.847
because he was waiting for his turn.

272
00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:36.447
No! It was Master's, Mr. Isegawa's, will to set the riddle time at 9 pm.

273
00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:38.747
Yeah, right. Who would believe that?

274
00:17:38.747 --> 00:17:41.647
I would! Because...

275
00:17:41.647 --> 00:17:43.647
Because that knife wasn't to hurt us,

276
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:45.847
but to make us realize the presence of the high-voltage current.

277
00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:49.147
The footsteps sounded like it was an adult.

278
00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:51.447
He is the only adult in here!

279
00:17:51.447 --> 00:17:53.647
I don't think he was trying to monitor or interfere with us.

280
00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:57.347
I think he was trying to protect Yuriko and us.

281
00:17:57.347 --> 00:17:59.547
Now, please, be careful.

282
00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:02.447
Some of the security systems are actually quite dangerous.

283
00:18:02.447 --> 00:18:06.647
I think so too. Mr. Clock isn't a bad person.

284
00:18:06.647 --> 00:18:08.847
Yuriko!

285
00:18:08.847 --> 00:18:11.447
When I was in that room...

286
00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:31.847
Okay, Fair enough.

287
00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:34.747
Yuriko's parents gave up on their grandfather and left the house.

288
00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.747
Ai, I don't think that's...

289
00:18:36.747 --> 00:18:38.947
Because of his nature of hating people.

290
00:18:38.947 --> 00:18:40.147
There's no way such person

291
00:18:40.147 --> 00:18:43.347
would tell his secret to a stranger even if he's the secretary

292
00:18:43.347 --> 00:18:46.147
So, my point is Mr. Clock is related to Mr. Isegawa.

293
00:18:46.147 --> 00:18:49.147
He's related to my great-grandfather.

294
00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:52.247
But at the same time, he was also someone Mr. Isegawa hated so much

295
00:18:52.247 --> 00:18:54.447
so that he had to lose his name,

296
00:18:54.447 --> 00:18:55.747
execute his master's will,

297
00:18:55.747 --> 00:18:59.547
and remain in this mansion until someone solves the riddle.

298
00:18:59.547 --> 00:19:03.047
There's only one person we can think of here.

299
00:19:03.047 --> 00:19:04.847
Probably, you are...

300
00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:07.347
Okay, that's enough!

301
00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:10.647
It wasn't the gold blocks Mr. Clock was trying to reach!

302
00:19:10.647 --> 00:19:11.747
It was that.

303
00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.847
Yuriko?

304
00:19:16.847 --> 00:19:20.447
No! It's Mr. Isegawa's granddaughter,

305
00:19:20.447 --> 00:19:22.247
Which is also Mr. Clock's wife.

306
00:19:22.247 --> 00:19:26.747
What? So that means Mr. Clock is Yuriko's...

307
00:19:26.747 --> 00:19:28.247
He's Yuriko's father.

308
00:19:28.247 --> 00:19:32.447
He's someone Mr. Isegawa hated the most but also related to him.

309
00:19:32.447 --> 00:19:38.247
Yuriko's father must be the one because he ran away with his wife!

310
00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:45.447
Mr. Isegawa loved his granddaughter, Yuriko's mother, so much.

311
00:19:45.447 --> 00:19:49.547
He said she reminded him of his wife a lot.

312
00:19:49.547 --> 00:19:54.647
So, he was desperate to get her back when we ran away from him.

313
00:19:54.647 --> 00:19:55.647
"Grandfather"

314
00:19:56.347 --> 00:19:58.147
Around that time, he had a lot of connections

315
00:19:58.147 --> 00:19:59.747
with the underground community.

316
00:19:59.747 --> 00:20:03.247
I didn't know what he would do if he got mad.

317
00:20:03.247 --> 00:20:06.347
So I decided to leave my wife and Yuriko who was just born,

318
00:20:06.347 --> 00:20:09.247
to protect them.

319
00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:10.947
I made a deal with Mr. Isegawa.

320
00:20:10.947 --> 00:20:14.547
I work for him so he leaves my family alone.

321
00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.747
To ease his anger, it was necessary to serve him

322
00:20:16.747 --> 00:20:19.947
with all my heart and soul.

323
00:20:21.147 --> 00:20:24.447
Master, it's getting windy now.

324
00:20:26.047 --> 00:20:28.447
I know but I like doing this.

325
00:20:33.647 --> 00:20:35.847
And one day I realized,

326
00:20:35.847 --> 00:20:38.447
he truly loved his family

327
00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:40.347
from the bottom of his heart.

328
00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:43.447
He didn't know the way to show it well.

329
00:20:43.447 --> 00:20:46.347
Raging Bull was a difficult

330
00:20:46.347 --> 00:20:49.447
but kind old man who valued his family.

331
00:20:49.447 --> 00:20:52.947
And it was last year that Mr. Isegawa suddenly started saying that

332
00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:56.647
he wanted to settle with his granddaughter or Yuriko's mother.

333
00:20:56.647 --> 00:21:02.147
So I looked for my family and found out about my wife's death.

334
00:21:02.147 --> 00:21:04.947
Mr. Isegawa collapsed rapidly with disappointment

335
00:21:04.947 --> 00:21:07.647
and died with the riddle.

336
00:21:07.647 --> 00:21:10.747
Presentation of the riddle is 9 pm.

337
00:21:10.747 --> 00:21:13.947
If the riddle is solved, you are free.

338
00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:16.447
Forgive me, Matsunaka.

339
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:23.047
I'm Yoshito Matsunaka,

340
00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:24.647
Yuriko's father.

341
00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:30.447
Your mother made that riddle when she was a child.

342
00:21:30.447 --> 00:21:31.947
Mom made it?

343
00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:35.947
Yes. So great-granddad chose that riddle

344
00:21:35.947 --> 00:21:38.047
because there was only one person who would know the answer.

345
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:42.247
It's you, because you're her daughter.

346
00:21:45.647 --> 00:21:47.347
Dad!

347
00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:49.947
Yuriko. Sorry.

348
00:21:49.947 --> 00:21:52.247
I'm sorry. Yuriko.

349
00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:29.347
Later, Mr. Clock decided to change the Angel's Mansion

350
00:23:29.347 --> 00:23:32.847
into a theme park of bulls and labyrinth,

351
00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:37.247
simply because Yuriko said it was her great-grandfather's dream.

352
00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:38.547
Haibara.

353
00:23:41.247 --> 00:23:43.047
I think so too.

354
00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:46.247
Probably, Mr. Isegawa made that huge labyrinth secretly,

355
00:23:46.247 --> 00:23:49.647
to please his kids.

356
00:23:49.647 --> 00:23:52.747
And also, to rebuild his family relationship.

357
00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:54.647
Now, his dream has finally come true.

358
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.347
"Next Episode" -A peace sign?

359
00:24:02.347 --> 00:24:03.947
Smile!

360
00:24:03.947 --> 00:24:05.947
What is this?

361
00:24:05.947 --> 00:24:08.047
"Comedian. Stage name: Smiley Peace"

362
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.247
Smiley Peace?

363
00:24:10.247 --> 00:24:12.247
Is that a dying message?

364
00:24:12.247 --> 00:24:16.047
He was saying Mr. Mizuhara was more important than his own life, I heard.

365
00:24:16.047 --> 00:24:18.047
More than his own life?

366
00:24:19.847 --> 00:24:24.047
If that's so, then that dying message makes sense!

367
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "The Man Who Called the Ambulance"

368
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.474
Next Conan's Hint:

369
00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:34.774
"Peace sign"

370
00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:36.574
Next week, you'll see Officer Takagi that you've never seen before!

371
00:24:36.574 --> 00:24:37.674
Is that true?

372
00:24:37.674 --> 00:24:39.474
Yeah, kind of.
