1
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:07,423
As times change,
difficult cases increase in number!

2
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:11,683
Let's review the double-murder
during the intro song!

3
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:13,683
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

4
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:15,933
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,353
His name? Detective Conan!

6
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,579
We were invited to
Yotsui Reika's birthday party.

7
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,669
Someone punctured
everyone's tires,

8
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:08,099
forcing us all to wait
in the lodge until morning.

9
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,579
That night, while searching
for the missing Reika,

10
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:16,129
Nikaido was drowned
in the fountain.

11
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,799
Ran was similarly attacked,
but managed to survive.

12
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,429
Judging from the
killer's power outage trick,

13
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,309
it was definitely
someone in the mansion!

14
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,329
Just then, Reika was
found drowned to death

15
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,439
in a bathtub!

16
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:39,369
"The Wealthy Daughter
Murder Case (Part 2)."

17
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,709
How did this happen to her?!

18
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,169
She was drowned.

19
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,039
I can't say anything
without examining

20
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,219
the water she swallowed,

21
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:03,419
but her head was probably
held underwater.

22
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,189
Which means that
Nikaido-san's drowning,

23
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,609
Ran's near-drowning
in the kitchen sink,

24
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:17,109
and this murder were all
done the exact same way.

25
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,369
Then that means!

26
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,449
These really are--

27
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,349
...random murders!

28
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:27,869
Most likely. And the
killer is rather cruel, too.

29
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,039
Look. Even her skirt
and socks are sopping wet--

30
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,539
evidence that she
put up quite a struggle.

31
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,629
Poor woman...

32
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,599
There are also
rope marks on her wrists

33
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:45,809
and a tape mark over her mouth.

34
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,999
It would seem
she was kept somewhere

35
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,809
prior to being killed.

36
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,979
Who would do
something this terrible?

37
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:02,949
Say, you three went to
the bathroom just now, right?

38
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,499
Yeah...

39
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:08,499
Did you see or hear
anything out of the ordinary?

40
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,369
No...

41
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,619
They waited outside
while I was in the bathroom,

42
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,749
but there wasn't
anything strange.

43
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:22,329
Before he went in last,
lchieda-san told us to make coffee,

44
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,469
so I don't know about after that...

45
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,039
I see.

46
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,079
That's how you got
your chance to kill her.

47
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,189
Mifune!

48
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:36,669
It takes at least five to six
minutes to make coffee.

49
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,709
That's all the time
you'd need to take her

50
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:45,659
to the bath and kill her.

51
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,369
No! I didn't do it!

52
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,959
Ichieda-san isn't the killer.

53
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,869
She's been dead for
at least an hour or two.

54
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,919
Meaning she was killed
between 5:00 and 6:00.

55
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,849
He didn't do it just now.

56
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:11,079
The same goes for
Gojo-san and Yone-san;

57
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:18,359
the three of them were with me
between 4:00 and 7:00.

58
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:26,079
This narrows down
the list of suspects

59
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,999
to Mifune-san and Rokuda-san,
who were in their rooms!

60
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,379
Then it's simple.
Rokuda's the killer

61
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,919
since I didn't do it.

62
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,299
Don't be a fool. I saw you.

63
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:49,099
At around 6:00 am, you left
your room and went somewhere.

64
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,929
Did you, Mifune?!

65
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:52,829
Yeah.

66
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,769
I got sleepy, so I went
upstairs to wash my face.

67
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,499
A likely story.

68
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,499
The upstairs washroom is
right next to the stairs.

69
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:05,239
You could've killed
her on your way there.

70
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,649
What?!

71
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,269
Yes, I could have.
There's no one to vouch for me.

72
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,249
But the same goes for you, too!

73
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:21,129
I never saw you
while I was up there!

74
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:25,189
At any rate, the murder was
between 5:00 and 6:00 am.

75
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,339
Only you two could've done it.

76
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,929
If you could kindly tell me
what you were doing then...

77
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,229
The old man's right.

78
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:42,439
She definitely died
between 5:00 and 6:00 am.

79
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:47,859
Which means those two
are the most suspicious.

80
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,659
But it's strange.

81
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,399
Why are her clothes so wet?

82
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,119
Even if she did
fight back, this is too--

83
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,769
Tape marks...

84
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:04,859
The killer used
both rope and tape?!

85
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:11,479
Rokuda-san.
You didn't leave your room at all?

86
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,219
That's right.

87
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:17,609
And you only left the
one time to wash your face?

88
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,689
Yeah.

89
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,479
Um...

90
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,109
Where exactly was
Reika-sama being held?

91
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,859
Doesn't it seem strange?
We searched the whole place!

92
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,109
We searched for her at 10:00.

93
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:37,079
There wasn't anything in here.

94
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,789
And the bathtub was empty.

95
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,959
Was she outside?
Maybe in the forest?!

96
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,899
No.

97
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,769
There's a better place than outside:

98
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,969
inside the trunk of one of your cars.

99
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:58,859
And you two were
the only ones who had

100
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:03,319
any time to haul her out from one.

101
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,359
Looks like one
of you is the lunatic

102
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:10,859
who's enjoying
these random murders.

103
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:14,279
Are these really random, though?

104
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,189
Ran was attacked for no reason;

105
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,249
it's only natural to think so.

106
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,399
But why?

107
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,689
Why did the culprit
wait to kill Reika-san

108
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,379
and let us find her only now?!

109
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,169
And it bothers me
that she was killed in here.

110
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,689
Why didn't the culprit
kill her at the fountain

111
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,519
instead of locking her in the trunk?

112
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:45,729
It would be safer and
easier than filling a bathtub.

113
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,149
What're you doing?!

114
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:49,739
Yikes!

115
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,819
The shower's on! Huh?

116
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,869
The shower?

117
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:58,019
Aha! So that's it!

118
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:03,289
This is a time-based trick!

119
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:06,499
In which case,
her unnecessarily wet clothes,

120
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:11,049
the tape marks,
the reason Ran was attacked,

121
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,769
and the reason Reika-san's
discovery was delayed

122
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:19,519
all share a common thread!

123
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,939
Which means he's the killer!

124
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,649
He's the bastard who attacked Ran!

125
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:32,019
But there's no proof
that he's the killer!

126
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,029
Darn it, isn't there anything?!

127
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,769
Idiot! You wanna
get wet that badly?!

128
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:40,489
Get wet?!

129
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,619
That's it! Just maybe--

130
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,819
For now, let's all
move to the living room

131
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,069
and wait until the cars arrive.

132
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,979
I'm concerned about Ran, too.

133
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:53,219
Not so fast!

134
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:55,839
Now what?!

135
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,429
That wasn't me...

136
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:04,689
Here we go again...

137
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,439
What is it, Detective?

138
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:12,439
I've figured out who the killer is.

139
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,329
What?!

140
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,449
The killer?!

141
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:18,659
Please remove your
coats and toss them this way.

142
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,329
That will clear all of this up.

143
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:23,569
Stop wasting our time!

144
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,769
Calm down. Let's just do what he says.

145
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,189
He says it'll help
determine who the killer is.

146
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,519
There! Now get checking!

147
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,599
Now you can
figure out who it is, right?!

148
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,189
So you are the one responsible

149
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:53,399
for all three incidents at this lodge!

150
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:08,678
Yes.

151
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:12,758
The one who drowned
Nikaido-san in the fountain,

152
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:18,298
drugged and attempted
to drown Ran in the kitchen,

153
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:22,718
and drowned Reika-san in here

154
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:26,958
was you, Ichieda-san!

155
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,418
Ichieda. Did you really--

156
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:36,428
Stop kidding around, Detective...

157
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,888
Do I look like an insane killer?

158
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:42,928
Before Nikaido-san was
murdered in the first incident,

159
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:46,808
we went into the forest
to look for Reika-san.

160
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:52,258
The two of you were with him, correct?

161
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,028
Yes...

162
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:57,928
In the forest, you decided
to split up and look for her.

163
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:02,428
Ichieda-san followed Nikaido-san

164
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:05,598
and lured him over to the fountain.

165
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:10,468
He probably said
he saw Reika-san by it.

166
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:13,588
Then he attacked
Nikaido-san from behind

167
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,508
and drowned him!

168
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,928
That's just conjecture!

169
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:21,138
Rokuda-san could've done
the same thing!

170
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:26,888
Besides, why would
I attack Ran-san?

171
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,188
This is the first time I've met her!

172
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:33,848
And I was with you
when the killer cut the lights

173
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,138
to attack her!

174
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:39,198
How could I have
shut the power off?

175
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:41,908
Don't tell me
I had an accomplice...

176
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:46,868
No, you can shut
it off easily enough

177
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:51,508
by using the air conditioners
and microwave ovens!

178
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,128
It's easy.

179
00:12:53,128 --> 00:13:00,548
You set the timers on all the
air conditioners to the same time,

180
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:06,768
and set the microwaves to high.

181
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:10,348
When the time comes,
there's a power overload,

182
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:13,388
which sets off the circuit breakers.

183
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:20,108
All the timers are still set to 12:30,

184
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:24,028
and Conan heard something
odd after the power failure.

185
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,318
Isn't that right?

186
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:29,758
Yeah! I heard a bell!

187
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:32,098
The microwaves here use dials,

188
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:34,038
so they still moved without power.

189
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,928
The microwave was
warm when I touched it later,

190
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,378
so he has to be right!

191
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,848
Hey, wait!

192
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:45,428
You then broke
the window to make it

193
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:48,428
look like the killer ran outside

194
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,388
and then urged us to make chase.

195
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:55,048
You then carried
Ran into the kitchen

196
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:57,148
and tried to drown her.

197
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:02,608
You had drugged her
coffee so she wouldn't fight back.

198
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,428
Shortly before the power went out,

199
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,698
you were in the kitchen with me,
looking for Reika-san.

200
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:15,258
You could have easily
turned the microwaves on

201
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,848
after I left!

202
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:20,298
Hold on.

203
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:23,468
Have you forgotten
that I have an alibi?

204
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:30,428
I was with you when
Reika-sama was killed!

205
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:34,928
If I'm supposedly
behind all three incidents,

206
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:39,358
then please explain
how I killed her.

207
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:42,098
He's right.

208
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:45,218
Reika-sama died
between 5:00 and 6:00.

209
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:50,198
He was with us the
entire time from 4:00 to 7:00.

210
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:54,718
And the sleeping
pills in Ran-san's drink...

211
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,888
Yone-san brought us that coffee!

212
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,048
We all chose our own cups!

213
00:14:59,258 --> 00:15:03,098
Could he really have
planned it in advance?

214
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:05,888
What if he wound up
with the drugged coffee?

215
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:08,638
It's simple.

216
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:12,348
All he had to do was not drink it.

217
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:14,928
But Ran-san chose her own cup, too.

218
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:18,348
How could he have predicted that?

219
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:21,228
He didn't need to.

220
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:23,488
Anybody would have done!

221
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:27,068
So we might've
been attacked too?!

222
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,538
If you were unlucky
enough to drink that coffee.

223
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:33,798
Had the drug paralyzed you,

224
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:38,758
you would've wound
up just like Ran.

225
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:40,958
So you were killing at random?

226
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,758
Stop treating me like a murderer...

227
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,928
Besides, wouldn't I have killed her

228
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,968
when the power went out?

229
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:53,968
No, you never intended to kill Ran.

230
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:58,978
That's right. It wasn't someone's
life you wanted then...

231
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,518
...it was testimony!

232
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:04,778
You wanted someone to
say that their head

233
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:06,568
was held underwater!

234
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:14,298
That would make
it seem like the killer

235
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:18,788
drowned the people in
all three incidents!

236
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:20,478
So then--

237
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,388
She didn't drown to death?

238
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,388
No, she drowned.

239
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:30,508
Her head just
wasn't held underwater.

240
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,428
Doesn't it seem strange?

241
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:36,758
Reika-san disappeared at 10:00 pm.

242
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:40,518
But she was killed
between 5:00 and 6:00 am.

243
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,098
For some reason, the culprit
waited seven or eight hours

244
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:45,438
to kill her.

245
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:49,298
And her clothes wouldn't get that wet,

246
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:52,408
no matter how much she fought back.

247
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,388
And for some reason,
the killer used tape

248
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,368
in addition to the rope.

249
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:01,598
The key to all these mysteries...

250
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:03,338
...is that shower.

251
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:04,878
The shower?

252
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:10,298
Normally, you fill a
bathtub using the faucet.

253
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:13,798
But when Conan just tried to use it,

254
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:16,798
water came out
of the shower instead.

255
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,558
Why was that?

256
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:21,928
It was because
the killer used the shower

257
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:24,758
to quietly fill the tub.

258
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:28,428
He taped her to the tub

259
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:33,318
so she would eventually drown.

260
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:37,258
Ichieda-san probably
drugged Reika-san

261
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:39,508
when she came down at 10:00,

262
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:43,328
carried her in here,
and used said trick.

263
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,298
He adjusted the shower
so that she would drown

264
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,918
between 5:00 and 6:00 am.

265
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:54,218
He stayed with us
between 5:00 and 6:00,

266
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:57,098
then pretended to
use the bathroom at 7:00

267
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:01,098
to pull her body out of the tub.

268
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:04,638
This crude trick
would've seemed obvious

269
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,388
had he not dropped a hint.

270
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:07,148
A hint?

271
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:11,638
Yes. The attack on
Ran was meant to make it

272
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:17,158
look like Reika-san's head
was held underwater too.

273
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:21,848
But there was a chance
that she might be discovered

274
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:24,378
inside the bathtub.

275
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:28,258
He burned out the
light bulbs here in advance

276
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:30,508
to keep people away,
but it'd be all over

277
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,588
if someone checked the tub.

278
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:38,888
But he overcame this problem
by checking the tub himself.

279
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,598
She's not in here.

280
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:49,068
Only you could've
done this, Ichieda-san!

281
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:53,638
Yes, I would be the most suspicious

282
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,598
if that trick really was used.

283
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,158
I'll grant you that.

284
00:18:57,508 --> 00:19:01,758
But did you see me do it?

285
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:05,748
You make some big claims,
yet you have no proof...

286
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:09,548
That's why I had
you remove your coats.

287
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,758
Then check already!

288
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:15,178
You won't find anything, though.

289
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:19,428
It wasn't your coat
that I wanted to see--

290
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:23,178
it was the water
blotches on your shirt!

291
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,968
The blotches on Gojo-san's sleeves

292
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:29,768
are from when he washed his hands.

293
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,258
The ones on Mifune-san's collar

294
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,238
are from when he washed his face.

295
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:39,428
So what are those
blotches on your arms?

296
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,368
These are the same as theirs--

297
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:44,578
You got them washing
your hands? I think not.

298
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:47,788
Washing your face? Nope.

299
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:51,298
You can't get blotches
there with your coat on!

300
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:55,098
Yes. You took your coat off

301
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:58,388
to keep it from
getting wet when you pulled

302
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,388
the sopping wet body out!

303
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:03,808
Your elbows are wet because
you rolled your sleeves up.

304
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:06,768
Isn't that right, Ichieda-san?

305
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:10,018
But why would he--

306
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,928
From the fact that
these were all drownings,

307
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:16,048
it may have to do with Yaeko-san,

308
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,868
who drowned in the
accident two years ago...

309
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:22,428
Yaeko didn't die in an accident.

310
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:23,928
She was murdered...

311
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,998
...by Nikaido and Reika!

312
00:20:27,598 --> 00:20:29,218
The day of the storm,

313
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:33,178
Yaeko took a lifeboat to
the island to rescue Reika.

314
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:38,598
She had one life vest on,
and one life vest for Reika.

315
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:41,428
But she was shocked
when she arrived--

316
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:45,098
Nikaido was there too.

317
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,138
There were only two life vests.

318
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:49,058
Are you saying--

319
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,098
They didn't!

320
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:54,928
They did! They took Yaeko's vest

321
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:57,398
and left her to die!

322
00:20:58,178 --> 00:21:00,468
I thought it was strange that Yaeko

323
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,428
wasn't wearing a vest
when we found her body

324
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:07,868
and that they both
said they hadn't seen her.

325
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,958
But how do we know
that's really what happened?

326
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:16,388
They fessed up
right before I killed them.

327
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:20,428
They confessed to
killing my beloved Yaeko!

328
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:26,928
The two of them deserved to die!

329
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,188
That's enough!

330
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:32,558
Yone-san!

331
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:36,388
No one deserves to die.

332
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,218
That doesn't mean I forgive her,

333
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:47,198
but one person's death
is another person's sadness.

334
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:53,668
My own sadness is enough as it is...

335
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:33,608
He attacked you too?

336
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:34,878
Yeah...

337
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:38,148
I don't remember much
because of the sleeping pills,

338
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:43,318
but I think Shinichi came to save me...

339
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:44,238
Eh?!

340
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:45,608
Uh oh!

341
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:49,818
But he wasn't there, was he?!

342
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:53,328
No. It was actually
Conan-kun who saved me...

343
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,038
You were just--

344
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:59,498
But it couldn't have
been that mystery nerd!

345
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:04,738
Yeah! He'd never be
that thoughtful!

346
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:09,508
Alright. That's enough, already.

347
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:17,268
This could be a good game!

348
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:18,898
Hey, now...

349
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,148
The championship
flag was shredded up?!

350
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,148
This was an inside job.

351
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:33,238
Here we go again...

352
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,208
No! You're not the real culprit!

353
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,778
