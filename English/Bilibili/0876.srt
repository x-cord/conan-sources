00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.710
It's so cute!

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.310
"Kyoichi Kusumi (50)" -Please push the remote control button.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.510
Okay.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.410
Amazing!

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.810
Let me.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.910
Let me try!

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
Suspicious person identified...

9
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

10
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.210
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

11
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910
A super high-tech factory downtown.

12
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.310
Deduction challenges cutting edge technology.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.010
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.910
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.510

"The Mechanical Witness"

17
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.251
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.951
It's a robot to be used by women as a self defense.

19
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.551
This is the research lab.

20
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.751
I see.

21
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.551
Mouse!

22
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:16.151
It's fast.

23
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.451
Please don't!

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:28.151
"Takeshi Tanizaki (45)" -It's my robot.

25
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:29.951
What?

26
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:31.651
I'm sorry about that.

27
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.151
But... Why?

28
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.651
"Fumika Horiuchi (32)" -You can say that again.

29
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.651
God knows why he made something like that.

30
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:43.151
"Kazuomi Isshiki (25)" -I think he wants to surprise girls.

31
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:46.751
What?

32
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:50.851
Why do we have to use our company's high technology skills

33
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:53.851
to make such prank item?

34
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.751
A bad one at it too.

35
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.451
Right?

36
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.951
I'm sorry, president.

37
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:02.851
I've got something urgent to talk to you about.

38
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:04.651
That's a problem.

39
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.551
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri,

40
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:08.951
I'll be right back, so please wait for me.

41
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.651
-Hello? -I understand.

42
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.651
Tonight?

43
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.651
I can't make it tonight.

44
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:17.251
Can we postpone it?

45
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.351
Sure.

46
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:24.251
You're not making fun of me anymore after today.

47
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:26.151
Just wait and see.

48
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:32.351
"Kusumi Machinery"

49
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:34.551
No way.

50
00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:36.151
Isn't there something you can do?

51
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.551
I already told you not to get too involved in online auctions.

52
00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:43.351
No advance payment of salary for you anymore.

53
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.751
What's with you acting so big shot?

54
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:55.251
This company should just go bankrupt.

55
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:56.451
"President's Office"

56
00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:58.751
I'm sorry I asked to come along.

57
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.751
If Mr. Mouri, who is famous, came by himself,

58
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:02.351
people would get suspicious.

59
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.051
No problem.

60
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:06.351
And, what do you think?

61
00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:10.051
Who looks most suspicious at this point?

62
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:13.051
I think it's Mr. Tanizaki.

63
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:17.851
Tanizaki?

64
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.351
Actually before coming here,

65
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.451
I tried checking on Myojo Technics

66
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.251
since they're under suspicion of information leaks

67
00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:26.451
and...

68
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.051
Darn it.

69
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:34.851
I felt sorry for him since he was laid off

70
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:38.151
and this is what I get.

71
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:40.151
I should just turn him into the police.

72
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:43.051
Even if you do, he's just going to play dumb.

73
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:46.051
Then, what should I do?

74
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:49.051
It's best to catch him red-handed.

75
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:52.251
Genuine parts were stolen, correct?

76
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.551
Yes.

77
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:56.551
But I wonder how he took it?

78
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:59.451
There's a metal detector at the doorway,

79
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.851
and since it's a precision device,

80
00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:03.551
it'll break if thrown out the window.

81
00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:05.351
What if the first floor window were used?

82
00:06:05.351 --> 00:06:07.751
There's no window on the first floor.

83
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:10.851
Direct sunlight is bad for precision devices.

84
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:25.451
Why are you dressed like that?

85
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.551
Like they say, if you want to hide a leaf,

86
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:30.151
hide it in the woods.

87
00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:34.651
We can keep an eye on both the entrance and the stairs from here.

88
00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:37.151
But, why tonight?

89
00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:38.651
It seems they're going to have an important presentation

90
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:41.151
at the other company.

91
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.951
Things are stolen routinely on the night before.

92
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:49.951
What is it?

93
00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:54.351
I guess something just fell.

94
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.151
Okay, I guess we'll start heading home then.

95
00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:58.151
Okay.

96
00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.351
What?

97
00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:00.751
What's the matter?

98
00:07:00.751 --> 00:07:02.351
Don't you smell gas?

99
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:10.151
Gas is leaking!

100
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:15.851
It won't open?

101
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:18.351
I think it's locked from the inside.

102
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.851
Mr. Mouri?

103
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:21.251
Do you have a spare key?

104
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.651
Spare key?

105
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:25.751
It's an internal lock so a locksmith has to be called.

106
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:27.751
We don't have time for that.

107
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:39.351
Everyone, what's wrong?

108
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:41.151
Please break the door down.

109
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:42.751
All right!

110
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.751
Isshiki, turn off the main gas switch.

111
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:13.451
Horiuchi, call the ambulance.

112
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.451
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

113
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:18.651
The gas pipe is broken.

114
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:20.551
I'll go close off the main gas power switch.

115
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:23.551
How is he?

116
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.351
Call the police.

117
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.251
All right.

118
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:06.651
The victim, Mr. Tanizaki, died of suffocation.

119
00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:09.751
Suffocation, not gas poisoning?

120
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:13.451
Yes, strangulation marks were found on his neck.

121
00:09:13.451 --> 00:09:15.451
He must've really struggled.

122
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:18.351
There were rope marks on the palm of his hands too.

123
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.951
On the other hand, in the bushes below the window,

124
00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:25.951
a rope about 30 m was found.

125
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.051
Although we're waiting for forensic results,

126
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.751
it is thought to be the murder weapon.

127
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:35.751
There were other wounds such as bleeding from the back of his head too.

128
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.251
Which means he was murdered?

129
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:39.651
Yes.

130
00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:42.051
I heard something fall

131
00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:45.051
just before the gas leak alarm went off.

132
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.151
You all heard it too, didn't you?

133
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:48.251
Yes.

134
00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:49.551
We heard it.

135
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:52.351
Judging from the shoe prints on the floor and the broke gas pipe,

136
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:55.751
there seems to have been a violent struggle.

137
00:09:57.251 --> 00:10:02.651
By the way, we found this among Mr. Tanizaki's belongings.

138
00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:04.451
Do you know what it is?

139
00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:06.751
It's the parts of a new robot

140
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:10.251
that we are currently in process of developing at our company.

141
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:11.951
To steal...

142
00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:13.551
No.

143
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:17.851
Rather it is more to help steal.

144
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:19.551
Just what do you mean?

145
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:23.651
The door was locked from the inside,

146
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.651
and a person from the outside was invited in.

147
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:28.151
I think that's what it was.

148
00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:32.151
But trouble came up and Mr. Tanizaki was murdered.

149
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:35.451
He's a traitor so it serves his right.

150
00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:39.251
And who is this person from outside?

151
00:10:39.251 --> 00:10:41.851
A man called Makita.

152
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.551
He works at Myojo Technics.

153
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:45.951
Check on it, will you?

154
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:47.051
Yes, sir.

155
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:53.951
Just in case, please tell me where you were on when it happened?

156
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:57.051
I was in the president's room on the third floor.

157
00:10:57.051 --> 00:11:00.151
I was in the research lab on this floor.

158
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.051
I went home at the usual time,

159
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:06.851
but forgot something and came back.

160
00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:11.951
Didn't you see any suspicious people on your way back here?

161
00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:15.051
No, I didn't.

162
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:18.251
You mean the perpetrator came in from outside?

163
00:11:18.251 --> 00:11:21.151
The door was locked from the inside.

164
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:24.651
But, the window was unlocked.

165
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.251
We may be able

166
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.951
to solve this case faster than expected.

167
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:33.851
Just as expected of you, Mouri!

168
00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:35.751
I hope so.

169
00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:53.851
That's the crime scene?

170
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.651
The president's room.

171
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:07.951
What's this?

172
00:12:10.551 --> 00:12:12.451
It's not just a plain soiled thing.

173
00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:17.351
This is...

174
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:19.751
Come to think of it...

175
00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:26.951
It's my robot.

176
00:12:28.651 --> 00:12:31.551
You're not making fun of me anymore after today.

177
00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:33.551
Just wait and see.

178
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:52.951
"Robot Mouse"

179
00:12:53.751 --> 00:12:55.151
I see.

180
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:56.651
So, that's the story.

181
00:12:57.951 --> 00:13:00.951
"Spare Prototype Components"

182
00:13:12.418 --> 00:13:14.018
What?

183
00:13:14.018 --> 00:13:15.718
Mr. Makita is innocent?

184
00:13:16.918 --> 00:13:19.418
According to Officer Takagi's report,

185
00:13:19.418 --> 00:13:22.518
Makita is assigned to the general affairs division

186
00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:24.618
that has nothing to do with technological development.

187
00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:27.718
But even the general affairs division wants information, don't they?

188
00:13:27.718 --> 00:13:29.918
Moreover, he also seems to have an alibi.

189
00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:30.918
What?

190
00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:33.418
As for the alibi...

191
00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:36.918
Hey!

192
00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:38.518
Mouri?

193
00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:41.418
Inspector, the mysteries been solved.

194
00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:43.518
Please call everyone over here.

195
00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:46.118
Okay!

196
00:13:48.718 --> 00:13:50.718
Mr. Mouri!

197
00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:53.618
You've figured out who the perpetrator is?

198
00:13:53.618 --> 00:13:54.618
Yes.

199
00:13:54.618 --> 00:13:57.418
You've figured out who the killer is, right?

200
00:13:57.418 --> 00:13:58.718
Because you just said a while ago,

201
00:13:58.718 --> 00:14:01.718
that the one who leaked information was Tanizaki.

202
00:14:01.718 --> 00:14:04.518
Actually, it wasn't so.

203
00:14:04.518 --> 00:14:05.618
What?

204
00:14:05.618 --> 00:14:07.318
On the contrary,

205
00:14:07.318 --> 00:14:11.918
Mr. Tanizaki was trying to catch the information leaker with his own hands.

206
00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:13.318
What did you say?

207
00:14:13.318 --> 00:14:19.218
Mr. Tanizaki's mouse robot was actually a security equipment.

208
00:14:20.418 --> 00:14:21.618
No way!

209
00:14:24.318 --> 00:14:25.618
What?

210
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.618
This was indeed a well-made robot,

211
00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:34.818
that it could recognize the perpetrator with its sensor.

212
00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:36.618
That's impossible!

213
00:14:36.618 --> 00:14:39.718
No AI could possibly recognize a perpetrator.

214
00:14:39.718 --> 00:14:42.618
She's right. This is no time for jokes.

215
00:14:42.618 --> 00:14:44.618
It sure can, though.

216
00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:02.718
You're the perpetrator, aren't you?

217
00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:04.318
Mr. Kazuomi Isshiki.

218
00:15:05.518 --> 00:15:07.018
Ridiculous.

219
00:15:07.018 --> 00:15:10.218
Mr. Mouri, you operated the mouse, didn't you?

220
00:15:10.218 --> 00:15:12.218
No, I didn't.

221
00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:15.718
The sensor on the robot reacted to a certain thing

222
00:15:15.718 --> 00:15:18.018
that is stuck to your shoe.

223
00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:21.618
What's on my shoe?

224
00:15:21.618 --> 00:15:25.018
That ink on the tip of your shoe!

225
00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:28.018
I'm back.

226
00:15:31.818 --> 00:15:33.418
What seems to be the matter?

227
00:15:38.618 --> 00:15:42.118
Mr. Isshiki, didn't you notice?

228
00:15:42.118 --> 00:15:44.518
That the same thing happened to you

229
00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:47.018
when you snuck into the room.

230
00:15:47.018 --> 00:15:49.518
I got this at home.

231
00:15:49.518 --> 00:15:55.018
Did you have the special ink that reacts to the sensor at home?

232
00:15:55.018 --> 00:15:57.518
Mr. Tanizaki thought it out

233
00:15:57.518 --> 00:16:00.018
so that the perpetrator wouldn't be able to get away with it.

234
00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:05.618
Okay. I confess.

235
00:16:05.618 --> 00:16:08.018
I'm the one who stole information.

236
00:16:08.018 --> 00:16:10.818
Is the person that you gave the information

237
00:16:10.818 --> 00:16:13.018
that you stole Mr. Makita of the general affairs division

238
00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:14.618
at Myojo Technics?

239
00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:18.818
No. I gave it to Hiraguchi of the development section.

240
00:16:18.818 --> 00:16:20.618
This was for the money.

241
00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:22.718
For him, it was to get promoted.

242
00:16:22.718 --> 00:16:25.318
So, who was Tanizaki seeing?

243
00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.818
According to Mr. Makita,

244
00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:30.218
he was asked when the next presentation would be held.

245
00:16:30.218 --> 00:16:33.218
He wanted to know in order to trap the perpetrator

246
00:16:33.218 --> 00:16:35.518
who leaked the information.

247
00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:39.518
That's why I told him to postpone it

248
00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:41.918
and yet...

249
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.218
Darn it!

250
00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:45.618
But, I didn't kill him.

251
00:16:45.618 --> 00:16:48.018
We got into a struggle and I hit his head.

252
00:16:48.018 --> 00:16:50.118
But, I didn't strangle him.

253
00:16:50.118 --> 00:16:51.518
It's true.

254
00:16:51.518 --> 00:16:53.318
Then who did?

255
00:16:53.318 --> 00:16:55.918
One of the two, who are over there, right?

256
00:16:55.918 --> 00:16:57.018
What?

257
00:16:57.018 --> 00:16:58.618
I was outside.

258
00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:01.418
If it were someone from outside, I would've seen the perpetrator flee.

259
00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:03.218
But I didn't see anybody.

260
00:17:03.218 --> 00:17:05.218
That doesn't make us the perpetrator, though.

261
00:17:05.218 --> 00:17:08.918
She hated Tanizaki.

262
00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:11.518
Just because I didn't like him, it doesn't mean that I would kill him.

263
00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:13.518
Then, it's the president.

264
00:17:13.518 --> 00:17:16.918
He thought that Tanizaki was the one who leaked information

265
00:17:16.918 --> 00:17:19.318
and figured he was betrayed. Therefore, he killed him.

266
00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:21.618
I'd never do such a thing.

267
00:17:21.618 --> 00:17:26.218
At any rate, Mr. Mouri, please tell us who the killer is.

268
00:17:26.218 --> 00:17:27.618
Sure.

269
00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:31.818
I will explain what happened in chronological order.

270
00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:33.918
Mr. Isshiki, before leaving the company,

271
00:17:33.918 --> 00:17:36.918
you hid the parts in this room.

272
00:17:36.918 --> 00:17:41.118
You chose this room because nobody usually uses it.

273
00:17:42.218 --> 00:17:44.118
In order to make it possible to come in from outside,

274
00:17:44.118 --> 00:17:46.118
you unlocked the window.

275
00:17:46.118 --> 00:17:50.118
Next you got ready the rope that you would hang outside.

276
00:17:50.118 --> 00:17:52.618
Where was the rope hooked onto?

277
00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:56.218
There is nowhere he could've hooked the rope onto on the outside fence.

278
00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:58.818
So, he hooked it on inside the room.

279
00:17:58.818 --> 00:17:59.918
On the gas pipe.

280
00:17:59.918 --> 00:18:01.918
What?

281
00:18:01.918 --> 00:18:04.318
He wound the rope around under the gas pipe,

282
00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:05.818
and then he pulled the to edges of the rope

283
00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:07.318
through the space in the ventilation fan

284
00:18:07.318 --> 00:18:08.818
right above the hot water heater

285
00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.218
and made the rope hang outside.

286
00:18:11.218 --> 00:18:15.018
That's why he needed a 30 m rope.

287
00:18:15.018 --> 00:18:18.218
This way, after everything is completed,

288
00:18:18.218 --> 00:18:21.318
he can retrieve the rope from below

289
00:18:21.318 --> 00:18:23.618
by just pulling it.

290
00:18:23.618 --> 00:18:25.318
There would be no evidence left behind

291
00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:28.118
and he could steal repeatedly.

292
00:18:28.118 --> 00:18:31.218
So after all preparations has been completed,

293
00:18:31.218 --> 00:18:34.118
Mr. Isshiki leaves the company once.

294
00:18:34.118 --> 00:18:35.818
Then after he sneaks back to the company again,

295
00:18:35.818 --> 00:18:38.618
he hides below the window and wait.

296
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:41.018
When the time is right,

297
00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:42.918
he climbs up the wall,

298
00:18:42.918 --> 00:18:46.918
and enters through the window.

299
00:18:50.918 --> 00:18:53.918
Mr. Isshiki didn't notice the robot

300
00:18:53.918 --> 00:18:56.518
because he was surprised by something.

301
00:18:57.618 --> 00:19:01.118
It was, Mr. Tanazaki, who was in the room.

302
00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:05.218
Mr. Tanizaki, who realized that you'd come in to steal

303
00:19:05.218 --> 00:19:08.118
because the presentation is tomorrow,

304
00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:10.218
found the parts that you had hidden

305
00:19:10.218 --> 00:19:12.918
and was waiting for you in hiding.

306
00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.818
He locked the door from inside

307
00:19:14.818 --> 00:19:17.318
so that the perpetrator couldn't flee.

308
00:19:17.318 --> 00:19:21.118
Then Mr. Tanizaki and Mr. Isshiki got into a struggle.

309
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.018
Mr. Tanizaki, who was struck,

310
00:19:23.018 --> 00:19:25.918
bled from the back of his head.

311
00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:28.818
Mr. Isshiki, who was flustered,

312
00:19:28.818 --> 00:19:31.218
fled the room.

313
00:19:32.718 --> 00:19:34.618
At this time,

314
00:19:34.618 --> 00:19:38.018
the gas pipe that supported the rope repeatedly,

315
00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:39.818
finally gave out.

316
00:19:42.618 --> 00:19:45.218
Mr. Isshiki almost fell.

317
00:19:49.318 --> 00:19:51.918
But, he miraculously made it through safely.

318
00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:56.218
Mr. Isshiki who made it to the ground,

319
00:19:56.218 --> 00:19:59.418
pulled the rope towards himself

320
00:19:59.418 --> 00:20:01.418
and into the thicket where he hid it.

321
00:20:05.018 --> 00:20:07.218
You decided to go back to the company

322
00:20:07.218 --> 00:20:11.718
because you were worried about Mr. Tanizaki, who you strucked.

323
00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:13.418
Exactly.

324
00:20:13.418 --> 00:20:17.218
But, I had no idea that a murderer was in the company.

325
00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:21.018
What kind of trick was used?

326
00:20:21.018 --> 00:20:23.418
What was the murder weapon?

327
00:20:23.418 --> 00:20:25.218
Mr. Isshiki.

328
00:20:25.218 --> 00:20:26.818
What is it?

329
00:20:26.818 --> 00:20:31.518
Didn't you think of what prevented you from falling?

330
00:20:31.518 --> 00:20:33.118
What do you mean?

331
00:20:33.118 --> 00:20:35.118
You didn't fall

332
00:20:35.118 --> 00:20:38.218
because Mr. Tanizaki grabbed the rope.

333
00:20:48.118 --> 00:20:51.518
But unable to endure the weight,

334
00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:54.418
the rope got stuck on Mr. Tanizaki's neck.

335
00:20:55.918 --> 00:20:57.718
And he was suspended into the air.

336
00:21:00.818 --> 00:21:03.318
That's a lie!

337
00:21:03.318 --> 00:21:07.218
I'm sorry but it's true.

338
00:21:07.218 --> 00:21:09.018
The footprints on the floor.

339
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.418
The hot water heater

340
00:21:10.418 --> 00:21:13.418
and the rust that was found on Mr. Tanizaki's back,

341
00:21:13.418 --> 00:21:15.818
as well as the blood that was found on the ventilation fan

342
00:21:15.818 --> 00:21:17.618
is evidence.

343
00:21:20.018 --> 00:21:24.218
Mr. Isshiki, Mr. Tanizaki lost his life

344
00:21:24.218 --> 00:21:26.618
because of the series of crimes you committed.

345
00:21:35.318 --> 00:21:37.318
Please forgive me!

346
00:21:37.318 --> 00:21:38.518
Forgive me!

347
00:21:39.818 --> 00:21:41.818
Forgive me!

348
00:23:21.618 --> 00:23:24.418
It doesn't look like a robot at all.

349
00:23:26.318 --> 00:23:29.818
It even feels real.

350
00:23:33.118 --> 00:23:38.718
Then, the one on my head is...

351
00:23:38.718 --> 00:23:40.418
Stupid.

352
00:23:42.318 --> 00:23:44.918
Just who are you calling stupid?

353
00:23:44.918 --> 00:23:48.018
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, you know?

354
00:23:50.718 --> 00:23:52.918
Then why can't you tell the difference?

355
00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:56.918
"Next Episode" -Yeah, you got a bump...

356
00:23:56.918 --> 00:24:00.718
I'm going to get that guy and turn him in to the police.

357
00:24:00.718 --> 00:24:02.718
Of course we'll help.

358
00:24:02.718 --> 00:24:05.118
It hurts...

359
00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:07.018
Darn it.

360
00:24:07.018 --> 00:24:09.718
How'd I get here?

361
00:24:10.818 --> 00:24:13.218
You don't even remember your name?

362
00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:16.118
No, not at all...

363
00:24:16.118 --> 00:24:18.418
Don't tell me he's the robber on the run?

364
00:24:19.118 --> 00:24:24.418
