1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:03,474
Iron Badger the great safe

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:05,674
at the residence of Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki,

3
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:08,174
is the impregnable great safe

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,974
that the great puppeteer of the days of Tokugawa,

5
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,974
Kichiemon Samizu had made.

6
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:17,774
Thief Kid sends a letter of challenge against Iron Badger.

7
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:19,674
He says that he will open the door of Iron Badger

8
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:23,574
that no thief has ever been able to open before.

9
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:26,674
However, because of the weight sensor that works in link

10
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:29,674
with the security device that Jirokichi had installed it is really tough,

11
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:32,174
even to try to get close to it.

12
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,174
On the day the crime was to be carried out,

13
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:39,474
Inspector Nakamori and his men secure the area with tight security

14
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:40,974
but, as if to despise the device,

15
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,774
in the room where the safe is, equipped with sensor and all,

16
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:46,274
Thief Kid's second letter of challenge is found there.

17
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:52,274
How on earth did he make it through the weight sensor?

18
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,874
Has Thief Kid already snuck into the house?

19
00:00:55,874 --> 00:01:00,874
And how does he propose to open the door of Iron Badger?

20
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:04,874
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

21
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:07,374
Saturday nights are for mystery.

22
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:09,374
An unexpected treasure is found in the safe.

23
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:11,474
Thief Kid finally shows is identity!

24
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,074
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,774
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,274
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:04,501
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 2)"

28
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,801
Hey.

29
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,501
Did you find Thief Kid?

30
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,401
No, not yet.

31
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,601
I don't think you should walk through this corridor.

32
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,601
Why not?

33
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,901
Because you'll be suspected as being Thief Kid.

34
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,201
Thanks to this brat!

35
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,201
Well, that puts me in a fix.

36
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:38,201
I was told to deliver this meal to master.

37
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,401
To Uncle?

38
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,601
Yes.

39
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:44,201
I just came here so I didn't know but...

40
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:49,601
it seems he recently eats just his dinner alone in his study.

41
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:52,501
And, for some reason, it seems that

42
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,701
when the dishes are taken from his study after dinner,

43
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,501
two dishes are always missing.

44
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:00,301
Why would the dishes disappear?

45
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,101
-I wonder. -The strange things

46
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:05,701
are not just the dinner and the missing dishes.

47
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:11,901
It seems that he goes into the safe room to check the safe.

48
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:16,701
I hear that he always has a cane with him at that time too.

49
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:20,201
You mean, Uncle who's almost always too energetic for his age?

50
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,401
Yes.

51
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,201
It's most likely that he can't open the safe

52
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,401
unless he has that cane and dishes.

53
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,601
No matter if the safe is guarded by a security device

54
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,601
that works in link with a weight sensor

55
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:34,601
that reacts to even one cigarette,

56
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:39,001
there's no point if the safe itself opens really easily.

57
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,001
I'm out of cigarettes.

58
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,101
-Ms. Seto. -Yes?

59
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,001
The extension rang a while ago.

60
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,001
Mr. Akitsu!

61
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,701
Oh, yes?

62
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:53,201
I'm sorry to bother you, but would you go buy me cigarettes?

63
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,601
All right.

64
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,701
I got a call from master a while ago,

65
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,301
asking if his dinner's not ready yet.

66
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,701
Okay, I'll deliver it to him!

67
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,101
Right away!

68
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,401
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,501
I'm sorry!

70
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,801
No problem.

71
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,101
Just what's taking you so long?

72
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,101
Hurry and bring my dinner!

73
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:26,001
Yes, right away, sir!

74
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,501
They're all wet.

75
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,801
No problem.

76
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,701
Be it the secretary or the maid,

77
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,701
hiring two that are totally useless.

78
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:41,001
Thank you.

79
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:46,601
He, the bodyguard is the only one that's dependable!

80
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,601
What did you want with me?

81
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,601
What do I want?

82
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,401
Oh, didn't you say

83
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:59,601
you wanted a helping hand, when I bring dinner to you here?

84
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,001
Oh, that's right.

85
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,301
First, let's go to the room!

86
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:05,401
Yes, sir!

87
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,501
What?

88
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,201
You're going to stop the security device?

89
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:22,001
When Thief Kid may be coming?

90
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,401
Yeah, that's right!

91
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,601
It's daily routine for me

92
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,801
to check inside the safe, you see!

93
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:33,101
I hope he's not Thief Kid.

94
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,101
Well, I'll be done in two or three minutes!

95
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,301
Don't you dare look inside till then!

96
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:53,501
The more I want to look when told not to.

97
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:57,701
No!

98
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,801
Oh, I thought so too.

99
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:04,001
And, can you also be quiet?

100
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:07,301
Advisor is making a call, you see.

101
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,101
A call?

102
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:13,001
He's always talking to someone inside!

103
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,801
He could be talking to himself, though.

104
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:19,301
Don't tell me that he forgot how to open the safe

105
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,401
and is asking somebody how to do it.

106
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,501
I wonder.

107
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:28,801
Advisor Suzuki recently eats dinner alone in his study.

108
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:31,701
And for some reason two dishes disappear.

109
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,201
When he goes to check the safe room later,

110
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,701
he, for some reason brings a cane,

111
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:39,201
and talks to someone while doing the check.

112
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:42,601
Moreover, that weird letter of challenge.

113
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,701
It can't be?

114
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,001
Conan!

115
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,801
Dinner's ready!

116
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,901
Okay, the check's over!

117
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:04,201
You can do what you like now!

118
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,801
Before you go back to your room,

119
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:11,401
may I check your body as well as the contents inside your bag?

120
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:14,901
Yeah, I guess, why not?

121
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,001
By the way, what's in the bag?

122
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,401
Not much.

123
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,101
Just an old album,

124
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,301
and a composition that I wrote,

125
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,701
and a picture that I drew when I was a child.

126
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:29,601
I have this urge to take it to my room and look at them sometimes.

127
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,601
It's true that there's only an album inside the bag.

128
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,801
Oh, right,

129
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,201
I'm going out now, but don't bother with me.

130
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:40,201
I had completely forgot that

131
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,201
I promised to have a meal with Mr. Chaki!

132
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,601
With Superintendent Chaki?

133
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:48,301
Here's the car key!

134
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,201
Park the car in the back.

135
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,401
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:56,301
Well, I guess me not being here will not be a problem!

137
00:08:56,301 --> 00:09:01,501
Because this little genius his arch rival is here!

138
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:05,201
I'll leave the rest to you, little genius!

139
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,301
Yep!

140
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:11,001
Announcing to all men guarding the Suzuki residence.

141
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:14,301
It's already time that Thief Kid announced that he'd be coming!

142
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,601
Remember, stay on guard all of you!

143
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:19,501
Don't be off your guard even when seeing a familiar face!

144
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,001
The man next to you may be Thief Kid!

145
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,901
After all, he's a master of disguise!

146
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:29,901
I wonder who he's disguised as. Thief Kid.

147
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,601
That brat was giving his piece of mind a while ago saying that,

148
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,201
the one who can place the letter of challenge in there

149
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,701
when the security device was turned off the first time is

150
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,701
the tanned bodyguard, Goto,

151
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:45,801
the sort of dense secretary, Akitsu,

152
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:49,601
and the klutzy maid, Mizuki.

153
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:53,301
Well, that bodyguard is clear!

154
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,401
He went out a while ago with Uncle Jirokichi, besides.

155
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,901
Then, is it either Mr. Akitsu or the maid?

156
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,401
It could be Akitsu.

157
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:07,501
He hasn't been around ever since he went out to buy my cigarette.

158
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:11,601
But, the maid seemed to be acting deliberately klutzy too.

159
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,501
There's one more suspicious person!

160
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,701
You know, Uncle Jirokichi!

161
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,801
What?

162
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,401
If your Uncle is Thief Kid,

163
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:24,501
he has the switch to the security device,

164
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,301
so it would be easy for him to put the letter of challenge there, right?

165
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:30,501
I guess so, but...

166
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:33,601
You didn't say that before!

167
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,901
I just realized it now.

168
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:40,201
Besides, when you scattered the coins,

169
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:43,701
Uncle Jirokichi picked them up and threw them to you, right?

170
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,201
Yeah.

171
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:48,901
Which hand did he throw it with?

172
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,301
I think it was his right hand.

173
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:55,101
Then which hand did Uncle Jirokichi throw

174
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,501
the car key that he threw to the bodyguard with?

175
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:02,301
If I remember correctly...

176
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:04,101
His left hand!

177
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,101
Hey, is that true?

178
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,201
Yep, back then

179
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,901
he took the key from his chest pocket using his right hand

180
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:13,101
and shifted it over to his left hand

181
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,401
when threw it to the bodyguard.

182
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:17,901
That's why I thought it was strange.

183
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,801
You mean, he's Thief Kid inside?

184
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:24,701
Then, shouldn't you tell Inspector Nakamori about this right away?

185
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:28,301
If they go after him now, they may still be able to catch him!

186
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,301
Right!

187
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:34,801
What? That old man may be Thief Kid?

188
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,601
No darn way!

189
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:41,901
But Advisor Suzuki switched off the security device a while ago

190
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,401
and went inside the safe room, didn't he?

191
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:49,301
Yeah, he went in there to do a routine check of the safe!

192
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:52,301
And, we did a full body check

193
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,201
as well as check the bag that he had,

194
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:57,801
but found nothing suspicious!

195
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,001
Besides, that old man went out with Superintendent Chaki just now

196
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,301
to grab a bite to eat!

197
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:06,701
So, how the heck could he be Thief Kid?

198
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:09,101
What about me?

199
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:15,201
Superintendent Chaki?

200
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,301
Aren't you supposed to be having dinner with Advisor Suzuki?

201
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,801
You idiot!

202
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,901
Why would I be doing something easygoing like that

203
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,601
at a time like this?

204
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:30,901
I went to the master's room to retrieve the dishes after dinner

205
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:34,201
and found that the closet door was opened slightly,

206
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,701
so I looked inside.

207
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:40,001
And found master was tied and sleeping inside!

208
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,201
Then, the old man that just left was...

209
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,301
Inspector!

210
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,901
I just checked.

211
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:54,001
I found many steel wires set up with a sign written,

212
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:57,201
"Danger, do not touch."

213
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,801
Therefore, it's hard to do anything.

214
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:00,801
That's ridiculous,

215
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,201
the time that old man came into this room

216
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,401
was just for two to three minutes.

217
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:11,301
Thief Kid?

218
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:19,601
"This is to confirm that I have searched inside Iron Badger". It says?

219
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,001
I see.

220
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:25,101
He was only after opening the door of the safe to begin with anyway.

221
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:28,601
So, he already carried out what he was planning to do?

222
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,601
How dare he?

223
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,301
Oh, I think it'd better not to go inside!

224
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:34,401
If it were Thief Kid,

225
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:39,001
I think he'd leave the security switched on.

226
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:43,901
Okay, Squad A get together with the bomb disengaging squad

227
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,301
and head on to rescue Mr. Suzuki!

228
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:51,901
All the rest of you, go after that guy and nab him!

229
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,201
It seems a bit boisterous behind us.

230
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,401
Never mind, let them be.

231
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:10,501
I assumed it would turn out this way.

232
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,677
Until just a while ago, there were so many squad people here...

233
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:27,577
It seems to have been a dream.

234
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:32,877
They still seem to be taking rescue procedures in Uncle's room.

235
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:37,877
But to think that Uncle was Thief Kid,

236
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,977
I should've talked to him a lot more.

237
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:44,277
About that, somehow doesn't something bother you?

238
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:47,577
The first one who switched off the security device

239
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:50,677
and put the letter of challenge there

240
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:52,577
was Thief Kid, right?

241
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:55,677
But, the Jirokichi that picked up the coins later

242
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,977
was the real one.

243
00:14:56,977 --> 00:15:00,577
The last one who threw the car key

244
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:02,577
was Thief Kid, right?

245
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:04,677
It sure is weird.

246
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,677
The real one came after Thief Kid

247
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:09,577
and the last one again is Thief Kid.

248
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,977
I wonder when they switched.

249
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:17,477
Hey, Conan, don't you think it's weird too?

250
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:19,977
He's gone again!

251
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:24,177
Well, that guy's Thief Kid, the magician under the moon.

252
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,177
So I'm sure he worked something ingenious out.

253
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:30,277
Hey, when you find that brat, we'll get ready to head on home!

254
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:34,177
Talk about no fun.

255
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,977
You really like to...

256
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:50,077
disguise yourself as a woman, don't you?

257
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:55,677
It's just so much more cute this way.

258
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,177
When did you figure it out?

259
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,977
Until the time you were urged to hurry and take the dinner to him

260
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:03,077
and you rushed to take it, then hit Pops in the rear end,

261
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:06,177
you were probably acting out being a klutz.

262
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:09,577
But, Pops dropping his coin purse from the impact

263
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:12,877
and the coins scattering all around were not what you expected.

264
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:16,677
Since you carelessly were not ready for this,

265
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:19,277
and couldn't afford picking the coins up with your bare hands,

266
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,077
but thought it unnatural not doing anything

267
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,977
and ignoring the situation,

268
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:26,977
so you spilled the water, right?

269
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,777
If the coins are wet,

270
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,677
even if you pick the coins up wiping them with a handkerchief,

271
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,777
it wouldn't look all that strange!

272
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:37,877
You figured out that I was Thief Kid with only that much info?

273
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:41,677
That word that you told the advisor!

274
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,477
Oh, didn't you say

275
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:49,577
you wanted a helping hand, when I bring dinner to you here?

276
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,577
That's when I figured out

277
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:57,277
the mystery of the first letter of challenge!

278
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,277
If you read the sentences in that letter

279
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:02,077
by connecting the letters on the very bottom from the left,

280
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:08,377
it reads, "Give me a helping hand!"

281
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:10,677
In other words, that letter of challenge

282
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:14,177
was something that the advisor himself had written

283
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,877
to Thief Kid asking for help!

284
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:20,277
You disclosed your identity to the advisor with that phrase,

285
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:22,877
was told in this room about the strategy

286
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,577
to get the squad men out of here, right?

287
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,177
You let him throw the key with his left hand,

288
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:28,677
made him lie about the dinner with the Superintendent

289
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,377
that would be disclosed in no time at all

290
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:33,877
and made him post the card of Thief Kid on the safe.

291
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:37,777
All to give people the illusion that the advisor was Thief Kid.

292
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:40,177
Is the man tied up in the closet

293
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:45,877
Mr. Akitsu who was put to sleep and disguised as the advisor?

294
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,277
You seem to be having a tough time.

295
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:55,577
Do you want help?

296
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:58,277
The door behind you.

297
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,377
It looks like something's poked onto it

298
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:01,777
a lot of times, doesn't it?

299
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,677
Yeah.

300
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:08,477
I'm pretty sure that if I turn this dial carelessly...

301
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,977
See?

302
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:22,277
So I guess you should leave things up to a professional!

303
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:32,077
Hey. Aren't the tiles over there strangely new?

304
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,377
See, over here.

305
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,377
Just as would be expected

306
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:49,977
of a great safe that was made by the genius maker of gadgets, Kichiemon.

307
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:59,577
"You lose" -I don't need this, though.

308
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:07,777
Then, you already know why I was called here, right?

309
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:09,377
After all, you chased the police away

310
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,477
knowing that it was my strategy.

311
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:15,977
Yeah, from the recent strange actions of the advisor.

312
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:19,277
He started eating dinner in his own room every night

313
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:21,477
to get fresh water.

314
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:25,477
He took two dishes that was served at dinner

315
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:30,777
and used one for water and the other to put dog food in.

316
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:35,077
And, he used his cane to push the two dishes

317
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:38,277
under the space beneath the safe!

318
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,477
He would say things like, "Just a little while more."

319
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:43,577
Yeah!

320
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:56,177
He did it for the unfortunate one that was swallowed by Iron Badger.

321
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:58,277
Him, over here!

322
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:08,277
Hey, cut it out!

323
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:12,577
According to the old man, it's written on the back of the bandana.

324
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:15,377
The way to open this Iron Badger!

325
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:19,077
He used to open Iron Badger each time by reading it.

326
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,277
Then, just as I thought...

327
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:25,077
Yeah, he found out that his dog Lupin wasn't around

328
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:28,877
after he closed the door of this safe.

329
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:32,877
So, having no choice, he came crying to me for help!

330
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:37,077
The only one who can open this crazy safe in a short time is...

331
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:44,877
None other than me, Thief Kid, you see!

332
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,877
Like I've been telling you!

333
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:52,177
I'm the real Jirokichi Suzuki!

334
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:54,677
Liar!

335
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:55,677
Superintendent Chaki said

336
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:58,777
he made no promise to go have dinner with you!

337
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,177
It's not Chaki!

338
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:04,677
I promised to see an old friend called Chiaki, you idiot!

339
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:07,477
Chiaki?

340
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:12,377
Which means that Thief Kid is still in that house?

341
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:21,177
So, they've finally found out that the old man is real and came back.

342
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:23,877
You're sure reckless, though.

343
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:26,877
One false move, and you'd be nabbed.

344
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:30,777
Yeah. At first I thought it was a trap,

345
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:32,877
but after sneaking in and finding out the reason,

346
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:34,677
I decided to give him a hand.

347
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:39,677
All thieves are great fans of "Gentleman Thief", you see.

348
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:43,577
I felt sorry for Lupin being held captive in the dark behind bars,

349
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:46,077
so I decided to lend a hand.

350
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:58,677
What a snob, like always.

351
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:04,277
Don't get too attached to me.

352
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:08,277
I mean, you're my enemy, because of your name, you see.

353
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:33,677
What? Lupin was locked up in that safe?

354
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:36,877
And, he made Thief Kid open it for him?

355
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:39,577
It's supposed to be a secret, though.

356
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:44,477
I guess, that old man owes Thief Kid one, now.

357
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:48,877
Yes. He was saying he had to thank him.

358
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,877
After handcuffing both his hands!

359
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:55,577
That's what he said.

360
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:58,777
Oh, I see.

361
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,977
Just as I thought.

362
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:11,977
What was that gun fire about?

363
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,877
Strange...

364
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:19,977
The blood is dried.

365
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:23,877
I also remember too. That right hand...

366
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:25,777
What's this?

367
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:28,277
It looks like something crystallized.

368
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:30,177
Next Conan,

369
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:34,177
"A Fool's Inheritance"

370
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:52,177
Next Conan's Hint:

371
00:24:52,177 --> 00:24:54,177
"Webcam"
