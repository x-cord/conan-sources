1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.940
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.040
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.540
Owning a super car is everyone's dream

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.540
and emotions run as high as the price.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.999
"The Super Car's Trap (Part 1)"

9
00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.199
How beautiful!

10
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.699
You can see the ocean!

11
00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.199
You sure can!

12
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.199
Hey. Where's Mr. Mouri?

13
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.499
That's strange, he was walking with us just a while ago.

14
00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:18.999
Hey! Why do you guys get to rest? That's not fair.

15
00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.399
Good grief, winning first prize in the drawing was real lucky

16
00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.399
but why's the hotel in such an inconvenient place

17
00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.599
and there's no buses either.

18
00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.999
Dad!

19
00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.299
Hurry up, Dad!

20
00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.399
What an inconvenient hotel.

21
00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.299
I knew it was too good to be true.

22
00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.799
The "eat all you can shabu-shabu" 2nd prize would've been better, huh?

23
00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.299
You can say that again.

24
00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.899
Come on, don't be a spoil sport!

25
00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.699
Well, I can't help it.

26
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.899
When're we going to reach the hotel anyway?

27
00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.299
We're almost there, don't give up!

28
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.099
That place we can see from here,

29
00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.499
I wonder if that's the Kirigamini Hotel.

30
00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.899
Please fill in the registration card.

31
00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.299
Mouri?

32
00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.599
It's Mr. Mouri, right? It'll be room 201.

33
00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.599
You know, this is a pretty nice hotel

34
00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.099
but why don't you provide your guests with pick-up service

35
00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.699
from the nearest train station or something?

36
00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.399
Stop it, dad.

37
00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.099
"Hisashi Suguro(28)" -I'm terribly sorry.

38
00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.999
"Kirigamini Hotel Front Desk Manager" -Let me show you to your room now.

39
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.499
Sorry.

40
00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.499
Let's go, Conan... Huh?

41
00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.299
Conan? Where are you?

42
00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.299
Neat, look at that...

43
00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.799
This is great!

44
00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.099
Conan, what are you doing here?

45
00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.499
Good grief, you're always wandering off.

46
00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.599
Look at that, isn't that neat?

47
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.399
Look at all those old sports cars!

48
00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.799
They are impressive.

49
00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.899
"Jaguar xk120" -This is a Jaguar xk120!

50
00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.499
The long nose and the beautifully curved fender

51
00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.299
is its characteristic features

52
00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.999
and it looks like a real jaguar, doesn't it?

53
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.599
Even today, many Jaguar collectors dream of owning this car.

54
00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:15.899
And this...

55
00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.699
"Mercedes Benz 300SL, Gull wing" -This is Mercedes Benz 300SL, Gull wing.

56
00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.099
Gull wing means the wings of a seagull.

57
00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.599
When you open the door,

58
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.599
it looks like a seagull with its wings spread out, doesn't it?

59
00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.399
You're right!

60
00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:35.599
Isn't that a Cadillac over there?

61
00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.799
"Cadillac El Dorado" -Yes, a Cadillac El Dorado.

62
00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.799
It's a 1953 convertible!

63
00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:42.199
It's said to be the most powerful

64
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.499
and ultimate American model.

65
00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.699
Production was limited to only about 500 cars

66
00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.899
and I heard they virtually disappeared from the show rooms in no time.

67
00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:53.699
They say collectors still talk about

68
00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.999
the El Dorado legacy!

69
00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.199
You know a lot of about these cars, don't you, kid?

70
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:04.299
This is the historic car show room we've just put up.

71
00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:06.199
I see.

72
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.999
The owner of this hotel is quite a car enthusiast.

73
00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.499
You could say he rebuilt this hotel just for this show room.

74
00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:15.699
What's that?

75
00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.799
There's an open space back there.

76
00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:19.599
Yes, that space is reserved

77
00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.699
for the owner's personal Ferrari Dino.

78
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.399
What? When you say Ferrari Dino,

79
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:29.999
you don't mean the 206 GT, do you?

80
00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.599
I certainly do.

81
00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.199
Amazing!

82
00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.599
Conan, what kind of car is it?

83
00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.299
They only made 152 of them

84
00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.799
and it's close to impossible to get your hands on one now.

85
00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:46.399
"Ferrari Dino 260GT" -Dino is the nickname of Alfredino Ferrari,

86
00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:50.899
the only son of Enzo Ferrari, Ferrari's creator.

87
00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.599
He died when he was 24 years old

88
00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.299
but the engine he helped design

89
00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:58.399
was built into the car.

90
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.899
That's why Enzo Ferrari named the model

91
00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:05.199
after his beloved son.

92
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.399
So that's the story behind it.

93
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.599
Suguro!

94
00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.099
Why isn't the manager of the front desk at the front desk,

95
00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.499
what are you doing here?

96
00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.699
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.499
By the way, guests.

98
00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:18.699
"Zenkichi Kuroiwa (45)" -This show room will be open

99
00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:19.999
"Hotel Manager" -for viewing starting tomorrow,

100
00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.399
until then, it is off limits to unauthorized personnel.

101
00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.199
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:38.699
I've seen that guest somewhere before.

103
00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:52.999
I'm glad you arrived safely, sir.

104
00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.599
"Daigo Teraizumi (60)" -This car's worth more than my life

105
00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.199
"Hotel President" -but driving it from Tokyo sure wore me out.

106
00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.799
Sir, the cars are already in their places.

107
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.999
Why don't you take yours there now?

108
00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.799
Hold it, just wait one minute, don't rush me.

109
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:12.099
I want to spend some time with "my friend"!

110
00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.799
Once it's on display,

111
00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:18.099
I won't be able to take it for a spin whenever I feel like it anymore.

112
00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.799
Sir, look at this.

113
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:23.599
A detective.

114
00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.999
What is this? There's only one bed in here!

115
00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:29.799
Don't complain.

116
00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:33.099
We should just be thankful we got first prize in the drawing.

117
00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.099
Do they expect all three of us to sleep on one bed?

118
00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:37.799
Let's tell them to give us a bigger room!

119
00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:40.299
Never mind, we'll use this sofa.

120
00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:43.799
He's such a baby.

121
00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:46.799
Don't worry! I'll take care of it!

122
00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:50.199
The opening ceremonies at 3.00 pm tomorrow afternoon.

123
00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:52.899
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

124
00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.699
That's right, don't worry.

125
00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.799
We're going ahead as scheduled, understand?

126
00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.699
Conan, get in here!

127
00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:06.399
Let me go, Ran!

128
00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:08.399
Stop being so stubborn, dad!

129
00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:11.199
The hotel's not so busy, what's the big deal?

130
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.599
I'm going to make them give us a bigger room!

131
00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:17.699
But won't they charge us if we do that?

132
00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:22.099
And if you make too big a fuss, they might throw us out!

133
00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.699
Mr. Mouri?

134
00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:30.699
A threatening letter?

135
00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:31.799
Let's see here.

136
00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:33.899
Don't open the show room

137
00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:35.599
or you'll be sorry.

138
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:40.299
That letter arrived at the hotel a few days ago,

139
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.899
my staff and I were just discussing what to do about it.

140
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:48.199
For a threatening letter, it doesn't sound so threatening,

141
00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:50.799
maybe it's just someone's idea of a joke?

142
00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.999
I hope you're right.

143
00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.299
But just to be on the safe side,

144
00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:57.799
would you mind guarding it until tomorrow's opening?

145
00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:00.699
We'd like the infamous private detective Kogoro Mouri

146
00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:02.699
to help us in this matter.

147
00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:06.099
Did you contact the police?

148
00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.599
If you accept this assignment,

149
00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:12.199
as a special favor, the hotel will let you stay in this suite,

150
00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:15.399
which our very best.

151
00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.499
This suite? Really? Dad.

152
00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:21.099
All right! I'll do it.

153
00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:22.599
Thank you very much.

154
00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:24.799
I can rest at ease now.

155
00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:29.399
You can all get a good night's sleep, I'll take care of everything.

156
00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:46.899
By the way, Ran,

157
00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:51.699
would you like to go for an after dinner drive with me?

158
00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:55.199
You mean in the Dino?

159
00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:57.499
Hey sir, can I go too?

160
00:09:57.499 --> 00:09:59.599
Of course you can.

161
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.499
Can I go too, dad?

162
00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:07.899
Geez, this is delicious, this filet is the best I've ever tasted.

163
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.999
Boy, it's good.

164
00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:11.899
How embarrassing.

165
00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:14.299
Boy, that was good!

166
00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:16.099
Bring me another serving!

167
00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:20.799
Oh no! Did it get on you?

168
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:23.899
Don't worry, it's not too bad.

169
00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:26.299
Dad, you've had too much to drink!

170
00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:28.099
Sir! It's terrible!

171
00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:31.199
There's trouble in the show room!

172
00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:32.299
What?

173
00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.399
Let me go,

174
00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.399
don't try to stop me!

175
00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:37.599
-Calm down, Mr. Ootake! -Let me go!

176
00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:38.999
Don't do it!

177
00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:40.599
Get out of my way!

178
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:42.099
Let go of me!

179
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:44.299
Let me do as I please!

180
00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:46.499
Don't be a fool!

181
00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:47.599
Shut up!

182
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:49.699
I'm going to wreck this car!

183
00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:51.999
Mr. Ootake, what's the matter with you?

184
00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:55.899
You love this car more than anything!

185
00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:56.899
What?

186
00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:00.399
Eh? He's trying to wreck his own car?

187
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:03.499
Mr. Ootake, how could you?

188
00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:06.999
How would you know how I feel?

189
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.599
What is this all about?

190
00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:13.599
I... I'm going to destroy this darn show room!

191
00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:31.388
This car, this 1953 El Dorado convertible was my dream.

192
00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:35.388
"Ichirou Ootake (55)" -I worked night and day

193
00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:38.688
"Travel Agency Manager" -and finally saved enough to buy it.

194
00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:42.988
Then why are you trying to destroy something so precious?

195
00:11:42.988 --> 00:11:45.388
I'd rather destroy it with my own hands

196
00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:48.088
than let someone else have it.

197
00:11:48.088 --> 00:11:49.388
That's why.

198
00:11:49.388 --> 00:11:53.588
Let someone else have it? What do you mean?

199
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:57.088
Ask Teraizumi over there what I mean,

200
00:11:57.088 --> 00:11:58.688
and then you'll know.

201
00:11:58.688 --> 00:12:01.988
What is this about, Mr. Teraizumi?

202
00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:04.088
It's all a gross misunderstanding.

203
00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:09.688
Mr. Ootake, you should be thanking me rather than hating me.

204
00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.288
Thank you?

205
00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:15.488
Not one single person is looking forward to this show room opening up.

206
00:12:15.488 --> 00:12:17.588
Except you, of course.

207
00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:19.488
He's right.

208
00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:22.688
I understand perfectly how Mr. Ootake feels

209
00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:25.088
about wanting to destroy his own car.

210
00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:27.188
It is true, no one is looking forward

211
00:12:27.188 --> 00:12:30.688
to seeing this show room open up.

212
00:12:30.688 --> 00:12:33.488
Excuse me, who are you two?

213
00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:35.388
"Shinsuke Sagara (37)" -My name is Shinsuke Sagara,

214
00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:37.688
"Car Repair Factory Manager" -like Mr. Ootake, I was also

215
00:12:37.688 --> 00:12:39.888
forced to let this Mercedes Benz go.

216
00:12:39.888 --> 00:12:42.088
"Jouji Kameoka (40)" -I'm Joji Kameoka,

217
00:12:42.088 --> 00:12:44.888
"Car Realtor Company Manager" -the former owner of that Jaguar.

218
00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:46.288
That Teraizumi over there,

219
00:12:46.288 --> 00:12:50.288
swindled the three of us and took our cars away!

220
00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:52.488
That's just nonsense.

221
00:12:52.488 --> 00:12:55.588
You brought that bad luck upon yourselves.

222
00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:58.288
What do you mean, he swindled you?

223
00:12:58.288 --> 00:13:02.988
Although it wasn't big, we all ran our own businesses.

224
00:13:02.988 --> 00:13:05.088
I ran a travel agency.

225
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:07.288
I was a realtor.

226
00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:09.788
I ran an car repair factory,

227
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:13.688
but with the economy so bad, we were having a difficult time.

228
00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:15.988
And that's when that Teraizumi approached us and said that

229
00:13:15.988 --> 00:13:18.388
if we put our cars down as collateral,

230
00:13:18.388 --> 00:13:21.188
he'd lend us money at a low interest rate.

231
00:13:21.188 --> 00:13:24.788
Of course, we accepted the offer.

232
00:13:24.788 --> 00:13:27.388
But it was a trap.

233
00:13:27.388 --> 00:13:29.088
We didn't find out until later,

234
00:13:29.088 --> 00:13:31.388
but that fellow was working behind our backs

235
00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:33.788
and sabotaging our businesses.

236
00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:37.488
We couldn't meet the dead line to repay our loans

237
00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:39.988
and so he got our cars.

238
00:13:39.988 --> 00:13:43.188
Teraizumi intended to cheat us from the very start,

239
00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:45.488
that's why he offered to lend us money!

240
00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:50.888
How dare you say things like that about me?

241
00:13:50.888 --> 00:13:54.788
Do you have proof I sabotaged your business?

242
00:13:54.788 --> 00:13:59.788
If you've got the energy to tell idiotic stories,

243
00:13:59.788 --> 00:14:01.088
why don't you go out

244
00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:03.288
and do something about getting the money to pay me back?

245
00:14:03.288 --> 00:14:05.888
Why you thief...

246
00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:08.088
You don't scare me,

247
00:14:08.088 --> 00:14:12.988
so you're the one who send me that threatening letter.

248
00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:14.488
Threatening letter?

249
00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:15.888
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.288
Don't play dumb,

251
00:14:17.288 --> 00:14:22.088
this show room will open, no matter what you do!

252
00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:29.088
Those shoes...

253
00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:31.388
Don't worry! I'll take care of it!

254
00:14:32.388 --> 00:14:35.488
The opening ceremonies at 3.00 pm tomorrow afternoon.

255
00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:38.888
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

256
00:14:38.888 --> 00:14:41.588
That's right, don't worry.

257
00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:44.488
We're going ahead as scheduled, understand?

258
00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:54.088
Excuse me. Mr. Sagara, what room are you in?

259
00:14:54.088 --> 00:14:57.088
I'm in 202.

260
00:14:57.088 --> 00:14:59.788
Why do you want to know?

261
00:14:59.788 --> 00:15:04.588
No, that car's really something else

262
00:15:04.588 --> 00:15:08.188
and I just thought I'd drop by and ask you all about it.

263
00:15:09.288 --> 00:15:13.388
Well, tonight's not a good time. I have plans.

264
00:15:13.388 --> 00:15:14.988
What kind of plans?

265
00:15:14.988 --> 00:15:17.288
I don't think that's any of your business.

266
00:15:17.288 --> 00:15:19.088
Yeah, you're right.

267
00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:25.388
Room service?

268
00:15:25.388 --> 00:15:26.988
I didn't ordered anything.

269
00:15:26.988 --> 00:15:29.488
I think you've made a mistake.

270
00:15:29.488 --> 00:15:32.088
No, you're the owner's guest

271
00:15:32.088 --> 00:15:34.588
and this is compliments of the hotel.

272
00:15:34.588 --> 00:15:37.588
Please feel free to call me if there's anything else you need.

273
00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:39.388
Well, if you say so.

274
00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:41.288
Maybe I'll have some wine then,

275
00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:42.988
something from the Bourgogne region.

276
00:15:42.988 --> 00:15:45.588
No, dad, no!

277
00:15:47.588 --> 00:15:51.688
I'm very sorry about ruining your pants earlier.

278
00:15:51.688 --> 00:15:54.088
No problem, it was nothing.

279
00:15:54.088 --> 00:15:56.188
I changed right away.

280
00:15:58.688 --> 00:16:00.488
That's the Dino's engine.

281
00:16:00.488 --> 00:16:01.488
Now that you mention it,

282
00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:05.188
I hear a car engine too, but it's very soft.

283
00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:08.088
There's no doubt about it, it's the Dino!

284
00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:09.288
Are you sure?

285
00:16:13.088 --> 00:16:15.888
Sir, where are you going at this hour?

286
00:16:15.888 --> 00:16:19.088
Those guys put me in a bad mood.

287
00:16:19.088 --> 00:16:20.588
I'm going for a drive.

288
00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:25.188
Mr. Teraizumi, the fog is thick tonight, I don't think you should go.

289
00:16:25.188 --> 00:16:29.488
It's safer than spending the night in the same hotel with those guys!

290
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:39.988
Remember, drive carefully.

291
00:16:39.988 --> 00:16:41.488
I will.

292
00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:07.488
Sir, Mr. Teraizumi hasn't returned yet.

293
00:17:07.488 --> 00:17:09.888
Oh, for goodness sakes, and it's already 9.00 am,

294
00:17:09.888 --> 00:17:12.588
where could he be?

295
00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:15.988
He's still not back?

296
00:17:15.988 --> 00:17:18.888
He's such a hopeless case.

297
00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:23.088
But then the opening ceremony's not until 3.00 pm,

298
00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:25.488
there's still plenty of time.

299
00:17:25.488 --> 00:17:27.488
You've got to be kidding,

300
00:17:27.488 --> 00:17:30.088
we've got to get the Dino set up

301
00:17:30.088 --> 00:17:33.388
and the guest will start arriving at about noon.

302
00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:37.688
I think it's odd though, he hasn't called at all.

303
00:17:37.688 --> 00:17:40.188
Did I hear Teraizumi's not back yet?

304
00:17:40.188 --> 00:17:42.888
Mr. Kameoka, Mr. Ootake.

305
00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:46.388
If he's been involved in an accident and can't get back,

306
00:17:46.388 --> 00:17:48.488
then I guess the opening ceremony's off.

307
00:17:48.488 --> 00:17:50.888
God's punished him, I know it!

308
00:17:50.888 --> 00:17:55.288
Doesn't Mr. Teraizumi have a cellular phone or something?

309
00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:57.988
Oh, that's right, I forgot all about that.

310
00:17:57.988 --> 00:17:59.888
Let me have that, I'll give him a piece of my mind

311
00:17:59.888 --> 00:18:03.488
and let him know how worried we were.

312
00:18:06.988 --> 00:18:08.688
Hello, is this Mr. Teraizumi?

313
00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:13.288
It's me, Mouri. Where are you?

314
00:18:13.288 --> 00:18:15.488
Where am I?

315
00:18:15.488 --> 00:18:18.088
It... it's pitch black.

316
00:18:18.088 --> 00:18:19.688
Pitch black?

317
00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:24.188
Hello, Mr. Teraizumi...

318
00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:25.488
What's the matter?

319
00:18:25.488 --> 00:18:27.588
It sounded like he was hurt.

320
00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:30.988
He said, "Where am I? It's pitch black"

321
00:18:30.988 --> 00:18:33.188
and then the line went dead.

322
00:18:33.188 --> 00:18:34.488
Pitch black?

323
00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.888
But it's all white outside with fog.

324
00:18:36.888 --> 00:18:39.088
Mr. Mouri, what did he mean pitch black?

325
00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:49.488
Sir, it's 10.00 am.

326
00:18:49.488 --> 00:18:52.388
We've got to start preparing for today's ceremony.

327
00:18:52.388 --> 00:18:53.888
Yes, you're right.

328
00:18:53.888 --> 00:18:55.488
Suguro, I'm counting on you.

329
00:18:55.488 --> 00:18:56.688
Yes, sir.

330
00:19:01.888 --> 00:19:05.088
Today's ceremony is cancelled, cancelled!

331
00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:07.588
God's punished him for sure!

332
00:19:07.588 --> 00:19:09.088
Good grief.

333
00:19:09.088 --> 00:19:11.788
It's just like the threatening letter said.

334
00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:16.588
Ran?

335
00:19:20.188 --> 00:19:23.388
Ran! Where are you!

336
00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:25.888
Conan! Over here!

337
00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:28.988
Ran!

338
00:19:34.688 --> 00:19:38.188
Ran, what happened, are you all right?

339
00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:40.488
Yes, I'm fine.

340
00:19:40.488 --> 00:19:42.188
Ran!

341
00:19:42.188 --> 00:19:43.888
What happened, Ran?

342
00:19:43.888 --> 00:19:45.588
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:47.288
I was taking my morning walk

344
00:19:47.288 --> 00:19:50.788
when I heard this voice in the fog and it just scared me.

345
00:19:50.788 --> 00:19:53.688
Aren't you Noda, the security guard?

346
00:19:53.688 --> 00:19:56.488
What are you doing here?

347
00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.688
"Kazuo Noda (50), Security Guard" -Well. I saw this young lady

348
00:19:58.688 --> 00:20:01.688
walking in the fog and she was heading for the cliff

349
00:20:01.688 --> 00:20:04.988
so I thought I better warn her

350
00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:07.188
and then all of a sudden, she starts screaming.

351
00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:09.288
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:09.288 --> 00:20:12.188
Good grief, you scared everybody!

353
00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:13.388
It's a car.

354
00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:16.188
Maybe Mr. Teraizumi's finally come back.

355
00:20:16.188 --> 00:20:18.888
No, that doesn't sound like him.

356
00:20:18.888 --> 00:20:20.788
That's Mr. Sagara's car.

357
00:20:28.788 --> 00:20:31.488
What's going on? Why're you all out here?

358
00:20:32.788 --> 00:20:35.488
You were right, you can tell whose car it is

359
00:20:35.488 --> 00:20:37.488
just by hearing the engine, that's fantastic.

360
00:20:38.788 --> 00:20:41.588
I know most of our regular guests.

361
00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:44.888
Well, I've got to get back to work.

362
00:20:44.888 --> 00:20:48.388
Mr. Sagara, where were you last night?

363
00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:51.888
Well, I went for a little drive around here.

364
00:20:52.888 --> 00:20:55.288
Did you see Mr. Teraizumi's car?

365
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:58.388
No. Now step back,

366
00:20:58.388 --> 00:21:00.888
I'm going to go park my car.

367
00:21:05.488 --> 00:21:10.488
Sir, it's already too late to get the Dino on display.

368
00:21:10.488 --> 00:21:14.988
Oh well, since we don't know where Mr. Teraizumi is,

369
00:21:14.988 --> 00:21:17.088
there's nothing we can do.

370
00:21:17.088 --> 00:21:18.888
Somebody, come quick!

371
00:21:20.088 --> 00:21:21.988
Teraizumi's...

372
00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:25.588
Something's wrong! He's in his car!

373
00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:26.888
What?

374
00:21:36.988 --> 00:21:38.088
Owner!

375
00:21:39.088 --> 00:21:40.588
Mr. Teraizumi!

376
00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:43.588
Owner!

377
00:21:43.588 --> 00:21:45.688
Get a doctor, call an ambulance!

378
00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:48.488
It's too late, he's already dead.

379
00:21:57.688 --> 00:22:00.488
The cause of death is carbon monoxide poison.

380
00:22:00.488 --> 00:22:04.888
The engine is running and the car is filled with exhaust fumes.

381
00:22:04.888 --> 00:22:09.688
I guess the exhaust fumes flowed backwards into the car.

382
00:22:09.688 --> 00:22:11.788
So that means this is an accidental death.

383
00:22:13.988 --> 00:22:16.788
The window's slightly open.

384
00:22:16.788 --> 00:22:18.488
What does this mean?

385
00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:22.988
Why? Why is the window open?

386
00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:27.488
Was this really an accident?

387
00:23:58.988 --> 00:24:01.988
"Next Episode" -You can stop the charade now, Mr. Kuroiwa.

388
00:24:01.988 --> 00:24:05.188
Tell us the truth, you're relieved he's dead, aren't you?

389
00:24:05.188 --> 00:24:07.688
I didn't hate him!

390
00:24:07.688 --> 00:24:09.788
Not like those men!

391
00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:12.788
Then the engine was running?

392
00:24:12.788 --> 00:24:14.988
How'd you know that, kid?

393
00:24:14.988 --> 00:24:17.088
Don't tell me it was you.

394
00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:19.288
No, you're wrong! It wasn't me!

395
00:24:19.288 --> 00:24:20.888
What is this?

396
00:24:20.888 --> 00:24:22.888
It breaks off straight across.

397
00:24:22.888 --> 00:24:28.509
Next Conan, "The Super Car's Trap (Part 2)"

398
00:24:29.106 --> 00:24:31.606
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:31.606 --> 00:24:33.606
"Coal tar"

400
00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:34.606
Next episode is the solution.

401
00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:35.906
I wonder if uncle will buy a car tool.

402
00:24:35.906 --> 00:24:37.306
A Ferrari or something?

403
00:24:37.306 --> 00:24:38.706
That's not possible.
