1
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,870
A canvas stained black with crime.

2
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,270
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,570
Seven people with issues are confined

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,870
in the waiting room of a station just like in a drama.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,870
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:28,828
"The Seven People in the Waiting Room"

9
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,328
"Ofumoto Station"

10
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:38,228
"Five hours earlier" "6:30 pm"

11
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,628
What a surprise.

12
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,928
We suddenly run into a typhoon on the day we're returning to Tokyo.

13
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,828
"Yuichi Hokari (35)" -Yes, really what a surprise.

14
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:49,928
To be with the famed Detective Sleeping Kogoro!

15
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,728
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

16
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:56,628
"Kikuo Inagaki (58), Masako Ueno (28)" -What a day.

17
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,828
The weather forecast was totally off.

18
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,228
Hurry and get everyone towels, will you?

19
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:03,628
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:04,728
"Hitoshi Takegami (54)" -This is the same as how my life is.

21
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:09,428
A succession of "suddenly" and "forecasts that are off".

22
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,728
In times like that, here's something for you!

23
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,428
I'll give it to you at a low price.

24
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:15,628
Fully guaranteed to never go off!

25
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,628
How dare you! Just how many people did you deceive till now?

26
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:21,528
I never deceived anyone.

27
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:24,828
I just introduced good value loans.

28
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:28,028
I trusted you and my factory went bankrupt.

29
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,528
Rather, it was driven into bankruptcy by the bank!

30
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:35,928
Listen, I'm not from the bank.

31
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,228
"Carl Morris (26), Backpacker"

32
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,128
Let me help you!

33
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,928
Thanks for the thought.

34
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,328
How modest!

35
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:48,528
Just like hot springs, it's Japan's specialty.

36
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,328
"Ofumoto's Attraction, Train Station Hot Spring" -I love Japan!

37
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,728
Your Japanese is good.

38
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,728
He talks a bit funny though.

39
00:03:56,728 --> 00:04:00,628
I travel the country and learn the language of that country.

40
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:03,928
That's my specialty!

41
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:07,928
"Noriko Kurusu (40)" -You guys! I wish you'd be a bit more quiet!

42
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,428
I tell you, that's why I hate the countryside.

43
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:16,728
What time does the next train get here?

44
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,428
I'm sure there's still a train bound for Tokyo.

45
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,228
I'm very sorry.

46
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,028
I've been told that in-bound and out-bound trains are stopped for now.

47
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:26,028
Is that correct?

48
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,428
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:30,628
Are you serious?

50
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:32,028
You must be joking!

51
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,928
If I don't make it in time tomorrow's lecture,

52
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,328
who's going to take responsibility for it?

53
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:39,528
My boss is at the next station waiting for me!

54
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,028
Your boss?

55
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,628
I think it's him.

56
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,328
Shonosuke Yuhara. A city councilor.

57
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,928
In other words, you're...

58
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:52,328
Mr. Yuhara secretary, right?

59
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:55,828
I came before him to make preparations for tomorrow.

60
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,928
By the way, who drew that poster?

61
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,828
-It's me. -You did?

62
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:02,128
Yes.

63
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:05,028
My boss's name is too small!

64
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,928
Fix it, okay. I'm going to borrow the phone.

65
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,428
But...

66
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:12,828
I'm sorry, you can't use the phone here,

67
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:15,528
because of the typhoon. Right?

68
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:16,728
That's right.

69
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:20,528
Which means we're all spending the night here together?

70
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,328
It sure sounds like fun!

71
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:23,928
You've gotta be kidding!

72
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:26,528
We're sure in a fix, aren't we?

73
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,328
Conan, are you okay?

74
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,228
Yep, I'm okay, but...

75
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:33,628
"Fune Shimao (70)" -Isn't dinner ready yet?

76
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:34,828
Dinner.

77
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,528
She's right, dinner.

78
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:38,228
I'm starved.

79
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:39,828
Is there a dining room or something?

80
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:41,028
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:45,428
Hey, don't we have some light meals and candies in the gift corner?

82
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,228
Boil the water immediately

83
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:51,328
and give the women and child blankets, will you?

84
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,528
Yes.

85
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:54,928
Wait, I'll go too.

86
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,028
I'm sorry, she's not up to it.

87
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,728
She still new here, so I've got to keep an eye on her.

88
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:04,728
Please spend your time as you wish, until the train recover.

89
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,128
May we also go to the hot spring?

90
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,228
Of course.

91
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,428
All right!

92
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:15,428
Shall we all go then, everyone?

93
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,928
Hot springs? The bus to the hot spring is not coming though.

94
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:21,628
No, I think he means the hot spring of this station, Dad.

95
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,628
"Train Station Hot Spring"

96
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:35,628
It rains in the hot spring too.

97
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,128
If we get to float sake in the water or something, it'll be just great.

98
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,328
It sounds really good.

99
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:43,128
Conan, why don't you come over this side?

100
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,328
I'll wash your back for you!

101
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:49,328
No, thanks, Ran. I'm fine!

102
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:52,028
I'm getting out.

103
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,928
Me too.

104
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,928
There was no key for the locker,

105
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:59,528
so we'd better beware of poor tourists.

106
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:03,328
I guess nasty jokes are also a specialty of Japan!

107
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,628
All right!

108
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:09,428
I'm going to get some local liquor at the gift corner after this.

109
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,728
I thought so.

110
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,728
What's this?

111
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:19,428
Let me see!

112
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:21,028
This is...

113
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:26,428
It says, "Mr. Mouri, somebody will be killed here tonight."

114
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:28,228
If this is true,

115
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,428
we wouldn't want the perpetrator to know about it, right?

116
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,428
But, this could be a prank, you know?

117
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:36,328
This thing is not complete.

118
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,628
Maybe the person didn't have time

119
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,828
to write down the name of the perpetrator?

120
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:43,128
"The culprit is..."

121
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,628
So then, who is it?

122
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:46,928
Who done it?

123
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:51,328
It's your job to find out, famed detective.

124
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,628
You were listening.

125
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:55,428
I adore Watson.

126
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:59,228
You can count on me as the assistant to a famed detective.

127
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,828
Or, it's also thinkable that he wrote it too, right?

128
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,928
Because he was the first to get out of the tub.

129
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:07,828
What? What's up?

130
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,928
So, is he.

131
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,428
It's nothing.

132
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:18,328
It's none of your business.

133
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:21,528
Sir, where and what were you doing

134
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,728
when we were taking a bath?

135
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:24,928
Hey!

136
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:28,228
It's rude to ask a stranger something like that!

137
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:33,128
I'm sorry. He loves to copy me and play detective.

138
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,428
I was here right through.

139
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:38,328
Because I had nothing and nowhere to go.

140
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:39,828
That's my life.

141
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:41,528
And is there anyone who can prove that?

142
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:44,128
I can prove it for him.

143
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:49,628
He was right there grumbling up.

144
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,928
Right through.

145
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:53,228
Which means you were here too.

146
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:57,228
That's right. But, we may also be lying for each other.

147
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:59,628
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

148
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,028
Only joking.

149
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:03,328
I'm just playing along with the detective game.

150
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,128
Geez, even my mail comes back undelivered!

151
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,528
Since we're playing detective, I'll tell you something else too.

152
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:14,528
Rather, if you're a famed detective, I'm sure you're already aware.

153
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:18,128
That man's a swindler.

154
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:19,928
That one's a pickpocket.

155
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:21,728
What?

156
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,628
Don't be ridiculous.

157
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,328
Where's the proof?

158
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,328
He had a load of pamphlets from different companies.

159
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,328
Paraphernalia for swindlers.

160
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:34,228
Approaching people after pretending to pick things that have been dropped

161
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,328
is a usual trick used by pickpockets.

162
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,128
Inviting people to go and take baths is also a method used.

163
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,728
She's right. But...

164
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:44,128
Is dinner ready yet?

165
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:47,828
You just ate, didn't you, granny?

166
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:50,728
You even ate up my cup noodles.

167
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,628
Who are you?

168
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:55,028
Hey, did you forget already?

169
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,328
And I was nice enough to give you food, and yet...

170
00:09:58,328 --> 00:09:59,628
Granny,

171
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:01,128
we'll have your family come pick you up

172
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,628
after the phones start working again, okay?

173
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:06,828
Oh, Masako, good work.

174
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,228
So, you're just pretending you forgot.

175
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:10,928
-What an unpleasant old woman. -Is Sue doing well?

176
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:14,828
My grandma died last year.

177
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,128
If so, please start dinner.

178
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:19,128
What a hopeless daughter-in-law.

179
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,228
Yes... I will, ma'am.

180
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:22,728
Darn it!

181
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:25,728
Everyone here seems suspicious.

182
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,528
"11:10 pm"

183
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:53,428
Where are you going?

184
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:56,228
I can't be wasting my time here.

185
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:58,228
I've got to make arrangements to meet my boss.

186
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:00,628
I guess I'll go flag a cab down somewhere.

187
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:03,628
There are no cabs around.

188
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:06,728
Please stay here and don't move.

189
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:07,928
What do you mean?

190
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:10,228
How dare you tell me what to do?

191
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,628
Get out of my way!

192
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,528
What was that?

193
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:17,928
Close the door!

194
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:22,828
She's gone.

195
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,528
Don't tell me that.

196
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:26,428
Dad, get up!

197
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,628
Hey, dad!

198
00:11:28,628 --> 00:11:31,428
What is it?

199
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:35,528
That woman secretary went out alone.

200
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,028
What?

201
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,328
This is...

202
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:43,528
Pops, where's the memo?

203
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,928
What? Did I drop it?

204
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,028
I wonder if she picked it up and read it?

205
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,128
It can't be!

206
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:53,228
Conan?

207
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,228
I'll go too!

208
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,228
Same here too!

209
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,128
I guess I've got no choice.

210
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:06,228
It's hard to believe she went walking out in this strong rain.

211
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:08,828
Maybe she's taking shelter somewhere.

212
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,328
Let's go look for her!

213
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:14,828
Hey. Don't go moving around on your own!

214
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:15,928
I tell you.

215
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:21,428
A gunshot?

216
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:23,628
That way!

217
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:25,328
What? Hey!

218
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:27,728
This is...

219
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,128
What's up, Conan?

220
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:30,828
What?

221
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,695
This is a homicide.

222
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,395
I feel bad doing this to the victim, Noriko,

223
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:49,195
but in order to preserve the scene of the crime,

224
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:53,195
all I did was leave her as is and put a blanket over her.

225
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,395
She was murdered?

226
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:57,195
What do you mean?

227
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:02,095
She was probably shot to death.

228
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:04,495
But, why her?

229
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,895
Who's the perpetrator?

230
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,295
Don't worry.

231
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:11,295
I, Kogoro Mouri, will definitely find the perpetrator

232
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,095
from among you, the suspects.

233
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,195
Wait a minute, there!

234
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,795
Why am I a suspect?

235
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:21,295
Holmes would never suspect Watson!

236
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:23,195
You've got motive.

237
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:26,495
You killed her because the victim saw through your true identity.

238
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:28,595
-No! -No!

239
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:34,695
Is dinner ready yet?

240
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:37,695
Who are you?

241
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:46,395
There's someone who wrote this, addressed to me.

242
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:49,795
Are you saying that what's written there is about this murder?

243
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,995
You mean you were warned about it and yet you couldn't prevent it,

244
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,995
famed detective my foot.

245
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,195
It wasn't a warning

246
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:59,295
but rather, somebody was asking the famed detective for help.

247
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:00,995
But, he couldn't prevent it.

248
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:02,295
It's the same thing, isn't it?

249
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:04,795
If it's referring to this murder...

250
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,995
Okay, let me confirm your alibis once more

251
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:14,795
and also check your belongings.

252
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:20,195
Where and what were you doing when Conan and I went outside?

253
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,695
And...

254
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,995
The gun?

255
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:28,595
It's probably been disposed of or hidden by the perpetrator already.

256
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,995
Well, I guess it can't be helped because you're not Holmes.

257
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:34,795
As for me, I was in back of the station.

258
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,095
I was alone so I don't have an alibi.

259
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:39,495
And, please take a look at this.

260
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:43,595
I was alone on the platform, so I don't have an alibi.

261
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:47,595
That's you already saw what's inside, but help yourself.

262
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,695
What about you?

263
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:52,895
I was in the restroom, rather, at the kiosk.

264
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,295
I was thirsty and wanted a drink.

265
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,695
Alone?

266
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,295
Yeah. No, rather, that granny was there.

267
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:02,695
She was pigging out on food.

268
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,895
I guess testifying is difficult for her.

269
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:08,695
And, I protest having my belongings checked.

270
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,695
A detective has no such right.

271
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,895
Well, that's true.

272
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,495
But, I'm not a detective.

273
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:18,795
What the heck are you doing? Hey!

274
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,195
Why you!

275
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,395
Is something missing?

276
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:26,495
No, nothing's missing.

277
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,195
I tell you, you love to keep us in suspense, don't you?

278
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:34,195
I guess we'll just have to experiment then.

279
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,895
Amazing!

280
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,495
You've got nice handwriting.

281
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,795
You mean we should compare handwritings?

282
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:46,695
Please write.

283
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,395
I think it's useless.

284
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,995
You can fool people all you want if you put your mind to it.

285
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,395
No, it just may work.

286
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,095
Although handwriting can be mimicked,

287
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,695
there are habits that can't be changed.

288
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,195
Why didn't I realize it?

289
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,995
That person's the one who wrote it!

290
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:10,195
It's a black out!

291
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:19,995
This is bad!

292
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,295
Masako?

293
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:22,495
How terrible!

294
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:24,195
Who on earth did this?

295
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,095
She's still breathing.

296
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:29,895
Ran, will you search for a towel and first aid kit?

297
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,195
Okay!

298
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:33,095
Everybody, stay where you are!

299
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,095
This is...

300
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,195
Could it be that she wrote it?

301
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:42,595
Yep, look at that.

302
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:45,695
That poster of the city councilor.

303
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:47,795
"Mister"

304
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,495
It's the same habit!

305
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:52,495
"An Impostor" -This is half torn too.

306
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,395
So, the perpetrator did it?

307
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:56,295
It was written, "So-and-so is an imposter"

308
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:59,295
that's why it's torn off.

309
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:00,995
It's that granny!

310
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,495
Conversing with her was all messed up.

311
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,195
She gave herself away.

312
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:08,795
Huh? That granny's not here?

313
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,895
Did she flee?

314
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,195
What wrong, Ran?

315
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,095
Granny?

316
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:23,395
I thought so.

317
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:26,195
Stop it! Give it back to me.

318
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,895
Today is the day for burnable trash.

319
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:32,695
Don't throw this away.

320
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:35,895
I tell you, what a hopeless daughter-in-law.

321
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:37,595
Oh, its so heavy.

322
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,495
Nice catch!

323
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,695
Just as expected of you!

324
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:48,195
Is this your gun?

325
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:49,895
I smell gunpowder.

326
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,795
You're the perpetrator!

327
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:54,395
I was testing it.

328
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:56,795
Before I came here, in the mountains.

329
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:59,295
You were target practicing?

330
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,495
No! After my factory went bankrupt,

331
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:05,095
I was threatened by some loan sharks

332
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:07,895
and started smuggling remodeled guns,

333
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:09,695
but it didn't work out well.

334
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:11,895
I thought the only way out was to die and came here.

335
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:14,195
But, I couldn't die.

336
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,295
But I would never shoot anybody just because of something like that.

337
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,195
I'm not the perpetrator.

338
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:22,295
It's the truth.

339
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:25,095
It does look like a remodeled gun,

340
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:28,095
but there's no way to match the bullets here.

341
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:30,995
Besides, he's not the imposter.

342
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:48,995
Since there's no way there'd be a taxi out here,

343
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:53,095
I wonder why did the victim go outside?

344
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:55,195
Wait second. If I remember correctly, back then...

345
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:02,695
I wonder what she was trying to look at anyway?

346
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,995
I can't see...

347
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,495
I see! That's why she went outside!

348
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:18,895
That's...

349
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:21,195
A picture's been removed?

350
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:24,495
Maybe she was killed because she saw it?

351
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,695
And after that, the perpetrator removed the picture?

352
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,095
Which means...

353
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,295
I get it!

354
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,795
If so, it's understandable why

355
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,995
that person reacted that way to granny back then!

356
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:37,595
And, one more thing.

357
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:41,095
When Masako saw this poster, something crossed her mind.

358
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:43,595
Right afterwards she was attacked during the black out.

359
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:46,295
No doubt about it, she found out.

360
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:48,595
Who the real target of the perpetrator was.

361
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:04,995
"Shonosuke Yuhara (65)" -The train's finally started running,

362
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,795
and yet where is my secretary?

363
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,895
Who the heck are you?

364
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,695
What the...

365
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:40,195
I see! The imposter...

366
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:44,495
was you, the station master!

367
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:48,995
Right, one false move could cause harm to someone.

368
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,395
Despite being threatened,

369
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:54,395
Masako tried to let you know when the perpetrator was off guard, Pops.

370
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,295
But, when the perpetrator found out, Masako was attacked.

371
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,495
How terrible!

372
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,595
"Kozo Yamazaki (60)" -He's the terrible one.

373
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,995
My son died because of him.

374
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,395
He became the scapegoat for the bribe that Yuhara accepted.

375
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,695
And was driven to commit suicide!

376
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:11,495
Then, you killed her because she found out who you were?

377
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:15,595
She didn't say what she was supposed to in the past

378
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:16,695
because she wanted to protect herself,

379
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:21,095
although she knew that my son, who was her colleague was innocent.

380
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:24,095
She got what she deserved!

381
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:25,195
I bet you were surprised

382
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:29,395
because you thought that granny saw you through, right?

383
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:32,495
Yeah. But, it was needless worry.

384
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,995
I just did everything to avenge the death of my son.

385
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:38,895
That doesn't give you the right to take someone else's life!

386
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:41,095
You even hurt Masako.

387
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:45,495
Your son would never want you doing anything like this.

388
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,395
Of course, it wouldn't make him happy either.

389
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:48,595
No way for sure.

390
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,795
Station employee, Masako who was taken to the hospital,

391
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,095
safely made it out alive.

392
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:29,895
This is the real station master?

393
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:33,095
Great, all's well.

394
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:36,295
So, those guys were on the wanted list after all.

395
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:40,295
Hurry, and make breakfast, will you?

396
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,695
A hopeless son-in-law, indeed.

397
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:45,495
Hey, hold it.

398
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,695
Hey, Dad! Where are you going?

399
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,995
I'm not your son-in-law!

400
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,195
See you. I guess we'll leave you behind, then.

401
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,395
"Next Episode" -Yes, it's the perpetrator

402
00:23:56,395 --> 00:24:00,395
who robbed 30 million yen from Beika City that night.

403
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,195
They're saying to stop the reconstruction?

404
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:08,495
The corpse is somewhere in Dongaraji Temple?

405
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:11,895
I'll bet you guys killed your father!

406
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,495
-What? -What?

407
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,895
To continue illegally keep receiving his pension!

408
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:24,295
Next Conan, "The Secret Hidden by Dongaraji Temple"

409
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,938
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:29,338
"Dongaraji Temple"

411
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:30,638
How did the temple get its name?

412
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:32,138
Because you don't have to worry. I'm on the case.

413
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,638
Really?
