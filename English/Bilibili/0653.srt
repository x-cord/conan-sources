1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.640
A strange letter was delivered to Heiji Hattori.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.440
It was from the culprit who had killed

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.840
the design company president Mr. Kansuke Wakamatsu,

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.340
a month ago at his villa in Karuizawa.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.540
Kazuha goes to Wakamatsu's main house in Osaka

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.940
as indicated in place of Heiji who had caught a cold,

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.440
and encounters an eerie figure with long hair there.

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.040
That figure had vanished during a moment's black-out,

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.240
but what's weirder is that the characters "EYE"

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.940
that was carved on the wall had also vanished.

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.340
The fact is, even at the incident in Karuizawa,

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.040
the victim had written a dying message

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.640
with his own blood on the tile floor,

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.440
but that had also vanished.

15
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.140
We visited the Wakamatsu residence in Tokyo

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.240
to check out the truth of the matter, when in front of us,

17
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.040
his son Ikuro was poisoned to death!

18
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.140
Kazuha, get on the phone!

19
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.840
-And call the police? -Yeah!

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.940
Tell them that the idiot who had the nerve to kill a person

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.840
right in front of a detective is here!

22
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.540
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.240
all hidden mysteries are women.

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.140
What does the alphabet "S",

25
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.840
the dying message that the president leave behind mean?

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.740
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.460
"Design of Poison and Illusion (S)"

30
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.260
The one about the case last month where the president was killed

31
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.660
and found in the bath room of his villa in Karuizawa.

32
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.360
You were the first one to find him, weren't you?

33
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.460
Yes.

34
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.360
Back then, there should've been a dying message

35
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.960
that the president wrote with his own blood.

36
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.260
But when the police got there, it was gone, right?

37
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.860
If I remember correctly,

38
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.260
you said that you remember that word that disappeared.

39
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.560
I remember you said something about it being an alphabet.

40
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.660
Don't tell me that the alphabets were...

41
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.160
E-Y-E?

42
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.460
It's probably referring to "eyes"!

43
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.960
I saw it, too!

44
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.360
I was contacted by the culprit who said he killed the president,

45
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.960
who told me to come to the president's residence in Osaka.

46
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.760
That's when I saw the eerie three letters that disappeared!

47
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.560
My... At that house in Osaka?

48
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.260
That's why we came all the way out here to hear more about it.

49
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.660
But, what I saw was...

50
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.960
the alphabet "S"!

51
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.860
There seemed to be continuation of something else

52
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.160
but it covered by his hand and I couldn't see it.

53
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.260
"S", was it?

54
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.960
Hey! Hold it!

55
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.560
The managing director Mr. Masashige Shiina

56
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.460
as well as Chief designer Mr. Masuo Fujinami,

57
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.760
the secretary Ms. Yoshiimi Satake,

58
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.760
and the president's wife Mrs. Serika Wakanatsu,

59
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.160
all have either names or last names

60
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.460
starting with the letter "S"!

61
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.860
My name is Sakurako, so it also starts with "S".

62
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.060
What?

63
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.360
Which means

64
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.560
the person who doesn't the initial "S" in his name

65
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.860
is Ikuro who was killed this time?

66
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.860
And? What did you do after you found the corpse?

67
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.060
I went to the living room of the villa to get Mrs. Wakamatsu.

68
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.460
Yes.

69
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.360
I confirmed the corpse of my husband together with her.

70
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.560
Call the ambulance immediately!

71
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.660
Yes, ma'am!

72
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.660
Use the telephone in the study!

73
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
Because there are times

74
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.660
when the connection is not good on the cell phone in this area.

75
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.460
And I go tell Ikuro about this

76
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.560
because I think he's still asleep in his room.

77
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.360
Please make sure that no one sees you

78
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.860
because I don't want anyone to see my husband like this.

79
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.860
Yes, ma'am!

80
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.560
And when the police arrived,

81
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.560
the dying message was gone?

82
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.960
Yes.

83
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.060
After making the call, I returned immediately to the bath room,

84
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.260
to find Ikuro clinging to his father and crying.

85
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.460
But it seems that the letters were already gone then.

86
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.160
-Mrs. Wakamatsu, didn't you see the letters? -No.

87
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.960
Because I was distracted right through looking at my husband's body.

88
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.860
Then, is it true that the same tiles

89
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.860
were used in the bath room of the villa

90
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.560
and the bath room of the house in Osaka?

91
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.860
Yes.

92
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.360
They were both made with tiles that my husband had special ordered.

93
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.060
But the rebuilding construction of

94
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.360
the main house in Osaka has already begun,

95
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.060
and as for the villa in Karuizawa,

96
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.160
as soon as the no trespassing cordon is taken away,

97
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
it is scheduled to be demolished.

98
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
We may not be able to see it ever again.

99
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.160
Then, where were you all when the president was killed?

100
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.560
We were in the living room together with the vice-president.

101
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.160
Actually there were a lot more people

102
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.460
who came to the vice-president's birthday party.

103
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.160
I was about to go home after the party with all the others

104
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.760
when the president called me.

105
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.460
He said he had something important to talk about.

106
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.460
Since the president told us to wait

107
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.560
until he finished sticking all the tiles of the bath room on.

108
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.260
All four of us were waiting in the living room

109
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.760
while playing poker for about two hours.

110
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.160
In other words, we've got a perfect alibi!

111
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.060
Because of the letter "S" that the housekeeper found,

112
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.760
we were the first to be suspected.

113
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.760
So we were persistently questioned by the police.

114
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.160
But because the president's wallet was gone,

115
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.660
and the murder weapon not being found.

116
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.560
Because there were traces of someone having broken in,

117
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.160
it was concluded that

118
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.060
what the housekeeper saw was probably a mistake.

119
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.760
It seems that the Nagano Prefectural Police

120
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.660
is now investigating case as a break-in by an intruder.

121
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.660
Mr. Mouri, may I have a word with you?

122
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.960
Huh?

123
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.760
What? No poison was detected?

124
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.160
There was none from the other pieces of baumkuchen?

125
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.960
No.

126
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.160
Toxic reaction was detected

127
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.160
only from the capsule that was found at the bottom of the teacup.

128
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.860
But the toxic reaction found in the teacup was also very slight,

129
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.960
so it could've been put there just to hide the evidence

130
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.460
after having finished using the poison,

131
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.260
or like you said, there is a high probability of foul play

132
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.760
being used to throw the investigation off.

133
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.860
Which means that only the piece of baumkuchen

134
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.660
that Ikuro ate was poisoned.

135
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.460
How strange.

136
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.060
Back then, Ikuro ate one of the two pieces

137
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.660
that were left on the tray.

138
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.160
How did the culprit make Ikuro pick up

139
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.360
the poisoned piece of baumkuchen?

140
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.960
Maybe the piece was a little larger after all?

141
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.460
Right, right!

142
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.060
It seems that he was pretty greedy when it came to food.

143
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.860
Actually we thought so, too.

144
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.960
So we went to the same store,

145
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.060
bought baumkuchen of the same size

146
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.360
and placed it on the tray back at the scene of the crime

147
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.960
together with the 7 pieces that were left behind.

148
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.260
It was perfectly divided into 8 even pieces.

149
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.660
What?

150
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.260
Then what? You mean the culprit sprinkled poison

151
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.460
on the baumkuchen after Ikuro picked up the piece,

152
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.260
yet no one realized what happened?

153
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.860
Of course not.

154
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.960
I mean, we're not dealing with an invisible man, you know.

155
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.760
It sure resembles the letter that was sent to you, no?

156
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.960
Yeah.

157
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.160
I'm a warped entity

158
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.860
that was created at the liberty of you humans.

159
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.560
You can't see him with the naked eye.

160
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.660
You mean he's an illusion?

161
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.460
Really?

162
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.860
Is it true that only the piece of baumkuchen

163
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.860
that Ikuro ate was poisoned?

164
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.160
Yes.

165
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.960
Moreover, when we put the 7 pieces of baumkuchen

166
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.160
that were left back at the scene of the crime,

167
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.360
on top of a baumkuchen before it was cut,

168
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.560
including the piece that Ikuro ate,

169
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.760
we found the pieces to be evenly divided into 8 pieces.

170
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.960
Well, it would be a different story

171
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.260
if the sizes of the pieces were the same,

172
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.360
but the poisoned piece was placed in the foreground

173
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.960
making it easy to take, though.

174
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.660
It wasn't the one in the foreground!

175
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.760
Ikuro stretched over to pick up a piece that was farther back!

176
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.860
-Right? Ms. Satake? -Yes.

177
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.060
It looked like that to me.

178
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.760
But you two are the ones who cut the bamkuchen

179
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.260
and put the pieces on the plates.

180
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.660
Having you two who were in a position where you could

181
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.660
most easily poison the baumkuchen saying that isn't very convincing.

182
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.260
-I saw it, too! -What?

183
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.660
Ikuro reaching over for the baumkuchen beyond.

184
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.960
Right! I saw him, too!

185
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.260
I was curious why he reached all the way

186
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.860
over for the piece beyond, you see!

187
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.460
So back then, Ikuro must've received a lot of attention from everyone?

188
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.660
He was saying something attention getting like

189
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.760
"I'm going to be the next president", too.

190
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.660
That's why I decided to follow him with my eyes.

191
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.660
Maybe the culprit bet on a 50/50 chance.

192
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.860
Hey, hey.

193
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.360
Then if Ikuro didn't pick the poisoned piece...

194
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.160
If so, the culprit may have been thinking

195
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.260
to drop the poisoned piece on the floor

196
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.660
by making it look like it slipped, rendering it inedible.

197
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.060
Moreover, on top of being greedy with food,

198
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.260
it was obvious that Ikuro was starving

199
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.360
so he would be the first to pick up a piece, too!

200
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.860
I see.

201
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.160
Or, maybe the culprit meant for Ikuro

202
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.260
to eat the piece in the foreground that wasn't poisoned,

203
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260
and was planning to poison to death managing director Shiina

204
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.760
who was supposed to be eating the piece that remained!

205
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.560
So if the culprit who killed the president in Karuizawa last month

206
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.860
and this time killed his son,

207
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.160
or rather, maybe managing director is the same person.

208
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.460
The cause may be in this house, or in the company.

209
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.960
Doesn't anything ring a bell?

210
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.660
No, there's nothing like that.

211
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.060
Now that you mentioned it...

212
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.860
I saw Mr. Wakamatsu arguing with Ikuro!

213
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.560
"You're the one who's using company money, aren't you?"

214
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.460
"Come on, spit it out!" He said.

215
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.560
Ikuro shouted back, "Can't you trust your own son?"

216
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.660
Was that a usual occurrence?

217
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.760
I think it was about a week

218
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.860
before the president died in Karuizawa.

219
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.760
Then, the thing he was planning to talk about at the villa that day

220
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.460
making us sleep over there was...

221
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.460
About the embezzlement of company money?

222
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.960
If that's the case, it's solved already.

223
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.460
I found that it was the entry mistake I made in the account book.

224
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.060
I was scolded severely by my husband later, though.

225
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.960
Well, regardless of what the motive of the murder was,

226
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.260
or who the target was,

227
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.760
we'll have to have you replay the situation

228
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.560
when Ikuro ate the baumkuchen and fell to the floor!

229
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.960
While it's still fresh in your mind.

230
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.860
We'll call you as soon as everything is ready.

231
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.660
So, please wait in this room for a while more.

232
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.960
Shoots. How do they expect us to replay the scene?

233
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.960
Well, it's useless just waiting, so...

234
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.960
Ms. Satake, will show me the design of the letters

235
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.960
you said you sent to this computer?

236
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.660
Yes, ma'am!

237
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.560
And, Ms. Yonehara.

238
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560
Yes.

239
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.560
Will you make more tea for us again?

240
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.560
Yes, ma'am!

241
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.060
Hey.

242
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.460
If Karuizawa is under the jurisdiction

243
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.460
of the Nagano Prefectural Police,

244
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.760
isn't the officer with the wounded eye that we met

245
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.360
during the Fuurinkazan incident there?

246
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.260
Oh, you mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

247
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.560
Why don't we call him then?

248
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.260
He may tell us something about the incident.

249
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
But I don't know his phone number.

250
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.060
If it's Yui's phone number,

251
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.960
the officer that got along well with him, I have it!

252
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.460
Then, maybe we can ask him something about the incident!

253
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.760
Yui had gone back to being an officer, besides!

254
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.260
-Really? -Yep.

255
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.860
But, how come you know her phone number?

256
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.160
I begged her to give it to me later!

257
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
On the day that the case was solved,

258
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.660
it seems that Yui was confessing how she felt to Inspector Yamato,

259
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.960
so I was concerned how it turned out, you see.

260
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.460
I mean, it's hard to think that nothing would happen

261
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.760
after she gave her heart out to him, right?

262
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.260
And? Did something happen between the two?

263
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.060
It seems that she ended up not confessing her feelings after all.

264
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.360
They haven't been phoning or mailing each other since then, I hear.

265
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.060
It could be that the two are doing their thing

266
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.460
without telling you about it then.

267
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.560
You idiot!

268
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.560
She told me that she would contact me

269
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.760
if she confessed her feelings to him.

270
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.060
She's not such a cold person besides!

271
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.760
Kazuha.

272
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.960
I have something I have to tell you.

273
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.760
Huh? What?

274
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.160
Not here, though.

275
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.860
Hey, hey. Let's call Yui quickly!

276
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.860
Maybe she'll tell us

277
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.660
what the tiles in the bath room

278
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.060
of where the president was killed were like.

279
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.260
It seems that the tile

280
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.560
is only left at the villa in Karuizawa already.

281
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.810
What? A family member of the president

282
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.010
who was killed at his villa in Karuizawa

283
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.710
was killed tonight in Tokyo?

284
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.610
-Is that true, Kazuha? -Yep!

285
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.710
I just happened to be at the site of the crime

286
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.810
and is really in a fix.

287
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.710
Heiji says that maybe the murderer of the incident over there

288
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.910
are one and the same with the one here.

289
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.110
That's why we want you to show us

290
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.710
the tile of the bath room where the president was killed!

291
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.910
That's the voice of

292
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.610
the dark-skinned detective boy I met back then, right?

293
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.910
Are Conan and Kogoro there, too?

294
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.710
Yes, they are!

295
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.010
We're telling you that we want some clue

296
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.710
if this is a case of serial killings!

297
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.810
He could still be after somebody, besides.

298
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.410
We just happen to be at that villa right now,

299
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.710
and it's the first time I'm seeing the site of the crime too.

300
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.110
You understand that I'm not usually supposed

301
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.510
to be giving out information like that to outsiders, right?

302
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.110
Hey, Uehara.

303
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.210
If that's a personal call, do it later!

304
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.810
We're going on!

305
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.110
Yes, sir!

306
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.210
But the detective boys and you have been a lot of help to me,

307
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.710
and the circumstance being what it is,

308
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.810
I'll try asking Kan-chan...

309
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.710
Rather, Inspector Yamato about it.

310
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.410
"Alcohol for the Young"

311
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.110
Maybe this is good?

312
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.910
It meets the demand of the client too.

313
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.610
But, don't you think it's a bit subdued?

314
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.610
I like the one three before this.

315
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.210
You mean this?

316
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.210
This is too flashy, don't you think?

317
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.710
What about the one two before it, then?

318
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.010
Vice-president, are you all right?

319
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.210
If your eyes are tired,

320
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.010
would you like to use my eye drops?

321
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.110
I just bought it, so it's not even open yet.

322
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.410
Thank you.

323
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.110
I guess I'll use it then.

324
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.910
I'm sure you're exhausted.

325
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.010
So many things happened today too.

326
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.610
I guess so.

327
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.810
Preparations have been completed.

328
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:39.810
Then, everyone,

329
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.610
let's go over to the living room that is the site of the crime.

330
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.410
The vice-president doesn't have to participate in this, does she?

331
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.010
It looks like she's really tired.

332
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.010
-But... -Besides, Mrs. Wakamatsu was

333
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.410
sitting right through back then and besides,

334
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.610
she didn't go close even once

335
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.510
to the baumkuchen that Ikuro ate either.

336
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.810
Right.

337
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.010
Maybe it's meaningless for her to come with us?

338
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.210
If so, would it be alright for me to stay back here?

339
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.410
Since so much has happened,

340
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.510
I'd like to be left alone for a while, too!

341
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.410
If you say so...

342
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.810
Well then, while you're waiting,

343
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.010
it would be a great help if you sign and stamp the contract

344
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.010
that is in the drawer of that desk.

345
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.210
Oh, that...

346
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.510
But the ink of the pen that is on this desk is out of ink.

347
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.710
Let me give you a fountain pen then.

348
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.910
It's what the president gave me a long time ago.

349
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.010
Thank you, you're a great help.

350
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.610
Shall we start going then?

351
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.010
Guess we got no choice.

352
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.410
There are two officers standing guard in front of the door.

353
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.110
So if anything should happen, call them.

354
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.710
Yes.

355
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.010
Excuse me.

356
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.110
Is anything the matter?

357
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.310
Mrs. Wakamatsu mentioned that we not be able to see the bath room tile

358
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.710
at the villa in Karuizawa, but actually...

359
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.910
What?

360
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.010
The tiles of the bath room in this house

361
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.810
are also the same type of tiles?

362
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.410
Why didn't you tell us about it a while ago?

363
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.910
Well, because Mrs. Wakamatsu didn't seem to like

364
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.810
having me talk about it.

365
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.510
Take us to that bath room, will you?

366
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.510
Okay.

367
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.010
So, we're borrowing the housekeeper for a while!

368
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.010
You all go on to the living room ahead of us, okay?

369
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.710
Hey.

370
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.910
Precisely speaking, the color of the tiles

371
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.510
are a bit different from those at the villa though.

372
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.710
The shapes of the tiles and the color

373
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.910
are more or less the same.

374
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.110
This is...

375
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.410
Hey, Uehara.

376
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.910
I didn't hear anything about the tiles

377
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.810
being this way at the scene of the crime.

378
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.010
But, just like it's been reported,

379
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.210
the color of the tiles gradually gets a little paler

380
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.410
as you go from top to bottom.

381
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.610
No.

382
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.110
It generally gets that way

383
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.710
because an optical illusion occurs!

384
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.510
If I remember correctly, this is...

385
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.710
An optical illusionary diamond with shading...

386
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.510
better known also as Crazy Diamond.

387
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.710
Crazy Diamond?

388
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.610
Each and every diamond shaped tile

389
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.010
measures an angle of 30 to 40 degrees from top to bottom.

390
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.210
Although there is only a slight gradation.

391
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.810
The eyes of people grasp the light

392
00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.310
and dark parts of the border line of the adjoining diagonal shaped tiles

393
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.010
as each and every dot,

394
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.110
and only focus their attention on that certain part,

395
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.310
that optical illusion reacts to make it

396
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.010
looks as though it is being viewed in entirety.

397
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.010
As a result, the diagonal shape on the top

398
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.510
and the diagonal shape on the bottom

399
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.410
look to be of totally different colors.

400
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.710
In other words, the brain miscalculates what it sees.

401
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.410
As proof of this...

402
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.210
This tile here and the tile at the top

403
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.210
are the same color, aren't they?

404
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.310
True, amazing!

405
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.310
Komei! What did you come here for?

406
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.310
This case is one handled by the headquarters!

407
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.810
You guys of the jurisdiction have no place in this!

408
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.510
Haven't you heard?

409
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.910
I returned to prefectural headquarters as of today.

410
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.710
Through my own efforts.

411
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.910
At any rate, we've got to report this to Mr. Mouri and the others

412
00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.010
who are at the residence of the president who was killed here!

413
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.810
They say that there's been a murder there too

414
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.210
and that it may be the same killer.

415
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.210
No.

416
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.910
Contact them after forensics examine the site.

417
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.110
-What? -Yeah.

418
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.710
If I remember correctly,

419
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.510
the dying message that the president who was killed here,

420
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.210
left behind had for some reason vanished.

421
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.210
If so, it is highly likely that the killer used illusion

422
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.410
to his advantage and switched the tiles with another!

423
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.510
If we're going to contact them,

424
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.910
let's do so after we revive the message.

425
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.410
If the letters were written with blood,

426
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.310
even if it were erased, it can be revived by a luminol reagent.

427
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.210
What's this crazy diamond about?

428
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.710
What is it, anyway?

429
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.410
So, it's a type of optical illusion, you see.

430
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.210
Kazuha's cell phone is ringing!

431
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.510
Hello?

432
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.610
Hey, detective boy from Osaka.

433
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.210
That voice! You're Inspector Yamato, aren't you?

434
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:58.010
We just found the dying message of the president in question!

435
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.510
Really?

436
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:04.510
Three letters of the alphabet were written, "S-O-N"!

437
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.710
Huh? "S-O-N"?

438
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.610
S-O-N...

439
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.810
Son.

440
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.110
His son?

441
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.210
Yeah! If the killer of the case over here,

442
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.010
and over there are the same,

443
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.910
nab his son!

444
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.010
Then, this case is closed!

445
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.010
-That's impossible. -What?

446
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.010
The one who was murdered here tonight

447
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.110
is that son, that's why.

448
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.510
What?

449
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.910
In other words, the one who murdered the president

450
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.510
and the one who murdered his son are...

451
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.110
Are two different people?

452
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.310
"Next Episode" -It... It's not something

453
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.310
I should be talking about at a time like this, but the thing is...

454
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.910
What? From Shinichi?

455
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.310
What a thing to be talking about at a murder site.

456
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.610
Ikuro didn't pick up the baumkuchen

457
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.610
with the poison on it by accident.

458
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.010
We checked your slipper

459
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.310
and found that you're the culprit!

460
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.110
Next Conan,

461
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.110
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Poison)"

462
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.910
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.910
"Slipper"

464
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.910
During Golden Week, I'm watching the movie "The 11th Striker"

465
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.910
and drinking beer at the soccer stadium.

466
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.310
So, you're drinking after all.
