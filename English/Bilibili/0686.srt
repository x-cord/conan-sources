1
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.840
Wait!

2
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.440
"Mao Misawa (5)" -Candy, wait!

3
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.840
Candy!

4
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.840
Wait!

5
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.440
Candy...

6
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.840
"2:30 pm"

7
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.840
"Time until explosion: 90 minutes"

8
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.440
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

9
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.440
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

10
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.040
A delivery van is loaded with a bomb.

11
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.340
The Youth Detective Squad only have seconds to carry out rescue.

12
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.040
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:06.195
"The Car Carrying the Time Bomb"

16
00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:07.695
"Mouri Detective Agency"

17
00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:09.795
How late is the Beika Library open again?

18
00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.095
I wonder if we'll make it in time...

19
00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:13.095
Ayumi!

20
00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:15.395
Candy's in trouble!

21
00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:16.795
Mao?

22
00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.195
What's the matter?

23
00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:19.895
Who is it?

24
00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:21.295
If I remember correctly,

25
00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:24.095
it's the girl who lives in Ayumi's neighborhood.

26
00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:25.195
What?

27
00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:28.995
Candy got on the delivery van and went along with it?

28
00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:33.295
Ayumi, I don't know what to do.

29
00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:34.995
Don't worry.

30
00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:38.895
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad will find her for you.

31
00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:41.095
So, don't worry.

32
00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:44.895
Let's go, Mao.

33
00:03:44.895 --> 00:03:46.495
Ayumi.

34
00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:49.195
Hey, hey, that's not work for the Detective Squad...

35
00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.595
It is.

36
00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:54.295
-Candy! -Candy!

37
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:08.295
Isn't that the car?

38
00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:09.295
Mao?

39
00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.495
Yes, the one with the fox mark.

40
00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:13.695
The FOX courier.

41
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:16.595
Candy! Candy!

42
00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:17.695
Up we go.

43
00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:21.195
Candy, where are you?

44
00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.495
Candy.

45
00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.895
What is it?

46
00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:25.295
Hey, you!

47
00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:27.795
Officer Chiba.

48
00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:29.295
Conan?

49
00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:30.895
She's not here.

50
00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.395
Looks like she's in a different car.

51
00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:34.895
Candy.

52
00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:37.695
Don't worry, we'll find her soon.

53
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:42.195
You can count on us, the Youth Detective Squad, okay?

54
00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:44.195
-You can count on us. -Leave it to us!

55
00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:47.895
Officer Chiba?

56
00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.195
Did something happen?

57
00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:54.395
Oh, no.

58
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:56.595
Hey, Chiba!

59
00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:58.695
Nothing on this side. How about there?

60
00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:01.795
Conan?

61
00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:04.095
Are working on a case or something?

62
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.895
Yes, sort of.

63
00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:09.095
Anyway, it's dangerous for you kids,

64
00:05:09.095 --> 00:05:10.695
so hurry on home.

65
00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:15.895
They seem to have gotten hold of one on 3rd Avenue, so let's go.

66
00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:16.895
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:17.995
Be careful, then.

68
00:05:17.995 --> 00:05:19.995
Good bye.

69
00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:21.295
Something's going on.

70
00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:22.895
Yes.

71
00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:26.195
You guys wait here.

72
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:27.595
Hey, Conan?

73
00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:29.395
You too, Ai!

74
00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.195
For goodness sake.

75
00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:34.995
Hello.

76
00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:37.195
Hello, Ran.

77
00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:38.995
What is it, Conan?

78
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:42.795
What's Pops Kogoro doing now?

79
00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:44.895
I'll go look, so hold on.

80
00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:46.895
Please...

81
00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:49.195
One more, please.

82
00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:51.995
Oh, come on, dad.

83
00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:54.095
Just as I thought.

84
00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:57.095
Never mind then.

85
00:05:57.095 --> 00:05:59.095
It's nothing. Bye.

86
00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.495
Yes, Megure here.

87
00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:05.295
Inspector, this is Mouri.

88
00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:07.295
Oh, it's you.

89
00:06:07.295 --> 00:06:09.395
I'm sort of busy right now.

90
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.795
Does the case have something to do with a delivery van?

91
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:13.995
What? Where did you get that information?

92
00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:18.195
I happened to see Officer Takagi and Chiba investigating.

93
00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:19.395
I see.

94
00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:21.595
And what kind of case is it?

95
00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:23.195
No, I can't...

96
00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:25.195
If it's something I can help out with,

97
00:06:25.195 --> 00:06:26.495
please let me know.

98
00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:29.195
Inspector!

99
00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:32.495
To tell you the truth, Mr. Mouri.

100
00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:37.195
There were two successive explosions from late noon today.

101
00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:38.395
What?

102
00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:41.095
The first victim was Kozo Tonomura,

103
00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:43.595
a district court judge.

104
00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:45.595
The second victim was Kazuhiko Saeki,

105
00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:47.495
a district attorney.

106
00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:50.195
Although both victims were seriously hurt,

107
00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:52.595
fortunately their lives are not in danger.

108
00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:57.495
Both were time bombs delivered by a courier.

109
00:06:57.495 --> 00:07:02.095
From the fingerprints that were found on the debris of the first bomb,

110
00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.495
a man called Utsugi,

111
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:06.395
who was serving time in prison until last month,

112
00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.295
was arrested on charges of violation of the explosives control law.

113
00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:13.295
His motive was to take revenge on those who indicted and punished him,

114
00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:15.595
that he held an unjustified grudge against.

115
00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:18.495
According to Utsugi's testimony,

116
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:21.095
there's one more bomb that was sent out.

117
00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.095
It went to an investigator

118
00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.095
who had arrested him in the past.

119
00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:27.895
I see.

120
00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:30.395
That's why they were investigating the courier trucks.

121
00:07:30.395 --> 00:07:31.495
Yes.

122
00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:34.495
But, the bad thing is...

123
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.695
Inspector Megure!

124
00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:38.795
We've confirmed that former Police Detective Kaneko is all right.

125
00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:41.295
It seems the bomb hasn't been delivered to him yet.

126
00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:42.495
Okay.

127
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.895
If we're going to believe Utsugi's testimony,

128
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:47.395
the time remaining for the last bomb to go off

129
00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:49.295
is 4:00 in the afternoon.

130
00:07:49.295 --> 00:07:51.695
An hour and a half to go.

131
00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:52.795
Inspector.

132
00:07:52.795 --> 00:07:56.495
We received an answer from the FOX courier.

133
00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:59.495
About the reception desk slip for the package in question,

134
00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:02.395
the delivery time has been specified

135
00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:03.995
between 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm today.

136
00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:06.395
And, where's the bomb now?

137
00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:10.795
The courier company is trying to contact the delivery van right now.

138
00:08:10.795 --> 00:08:13.895
We've asked to have the bomb squad dispatched too.

139
00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:15.995
They'll head for the site as soon as it is found.

140
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.395
I see.

141
00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:19.895
I guess we'll make it in time somehow.

142
00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:22.695
Yes, hello.

143
00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:27.395
What? The delivery van was stolen?

144
00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:29.295
What?

145
00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:31.695
Yes, this is van number four.

146
00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:33.995
Bomb?

147
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:37.295
-Give me the key, I tell you! -What do you think you're doing?

148
00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:50.695
Kingo Ebisawa, 28 years old.

149
00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:52.995
Ginji Kaniyama, 25 years old.

150
00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:55.895
They both have previous police records of committing robbery.

151
00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:59.195
Before noon today, they broke into Marukane Loan in Beikacho

152
00:08:59.195 --> 00:09:01.395
and robbed one million yen.

153
00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:03.595
The two that were on the surveillance camera

154
00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:06.495
and the description that the courier driver gave, matched.

155
00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.695
Marukane Loan? If I remember correctly...

156
00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:14.095
Yes. That corrupted loan shark.

157
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.895
But why would they steal a delivery van?

158
00:09:17.895 --> 00:09:21.195
It seems that their getaway car stalled,

159
00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:24.395
and was abandoned nearby.

160
00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:28.395
It was probably to intercept the wireless radio of the police.

161
00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:31.895
There was a wireless also found in the car that they abandoned.

162
00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:33.295
I see.

163
00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:36.795
That's why they robbed a delivery van equipped with a wireless too.

164
00:09:36.795 --> 00:09:40.795
Yes. They're probably totally unaware that a bomb is loaded inside.

165
00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:43.895
How could this have happened?

166
00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:47.995
We're doing the best we can right now.

167
00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:52.195
But, we still have no idea of the whereabouts of the delivery van.

168
00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:53.595
I see.

169
00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:56.395
By the way, where was the delivery van stolen?

170
00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:00.195
In the residential district of 3-Beikacho.

171
00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:01.895
I see.

172
00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:05.995
Then, if I find anything here, I'll let you know.

173
00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:07.095
Thanks.

174
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:08.295
If you will excuse me...

175
00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.295
Don't tell me it's that delivery van.

176
00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:15.795
Yes, maybe...

177
00:10:15.795 --> 00:10:19.395
Conan, how long do we have to stick around here?

178
00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:22.995
Really. Do you really want to look for Candy or not?

179
00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:25.195
Please the two of you!

180
00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:27.995
Yes, of course we'll look for her.

181
00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:32.595
Mao, where did Candy get on the delivery van?

182
00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:36.095
From The Metropolitan Police Department to all stations.

183
00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:37.195
Continue investigations centering around the area

184
00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:39.195
where the getaway car of the robbers was found.

185
00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:40.395
The vehicle to be pursued is a FOX delivery van.

186
00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:42.095
We did it!

187
00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:45.695
Kinji. We can deceive the cops now and get away.

188
00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:46.695
Yeah.

189
00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:49.495
Thanks to you being a good mechanic.

190
00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:52.295
What's with you?

191
00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:56.395
You're cute.

192
00:10:58.795 --> 00:10:59.995
"2:50 pm"

193
00:10:59.995 --> 00:11:01.295
"Time until explosion: 70 minutes"

194
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.795
Right here. This is where Candy got on the FOX car.

195
00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:08.595
And, it turned that corner right away and you lost sight of it?

196
00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:10.395
Yes.

197
00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:14.895
But... Isn't it no use to come here anymore?

198
00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:18.295
I'm sure the van's gone far away by now.

199
00:11:18.295 --> 00:11:22.795
But, at least we can get an idea of which direction it headed for.

200
00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:23.795
Is it true?

201
00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:27.295
Yeah. To the right is the exit of a one way street.

202
00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:31.395
To the left, the street is under construction and closed off.

203
00:11:31.395 --> 00:11:32.895
All the side streets along the way

204
00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:36.195
are not big enough for the delivery van to make it through.

205
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.495
Which means...

206
00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:39.795
It went straight down this street!

207
00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:40.995
That's right.

208
00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:43.795
All right! Hurry, hurry!

209
00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:46.695
We did it!

210
00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:49.295
The cars are stalled because of a traffic jam.

211
00:11:49.295 --> 00:11:51.895
At this rate, maybe we can catch up with the van.

212
00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:55.995
But, which way?

213
00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:57.895
Right? Left?

214
00:11:57.895 --> 00:12:00.095
Which way do we go?

215
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:03.095
From the psychological state of the getaway culprits,

216
00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:05.595
it is highly improbable that they would cut across the traffic jam

217
00:12:05.595 --> 00:12:07.395
and go over to the other side.

218
00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:09.895
This way.

219
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.095
Wait, Ai.

220
00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:14.095
Hurry, hurry!

221
00:12:14.095 --> 00:12:16.195
You're right, Ai.

222
00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:18.195
Just in case.

223
00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.695
Hello, Doctor Agasa?

224
00:12:26.295 --> 00:12:29.395
Darn! Isn't there a way to bypass the traffic?

225
00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:30.695
Come on, man!

226
00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:34.795
Hey, Kinji, won't you stop by at a convenience store?

227
00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:39.195
The dog and I are hungry.

228
00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:41.395
What the heck is wrong with this?

229
00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:43.295
Darn it! Darn it!

230
00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:46.395
To think that they would even deliver a dog by courier.

231
00:12:46.395 --> 00:12:49.095
They even forgot to write the address of where to send her.

232
00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:50.895
Where are you going?

233
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.495
Only joke.

234
00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:54.795
Cut out the noise.

235
00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:57.695
Come on over here and do something about this navigator.

236
00:12:57.695 --> 00:12:59.495
Hey, did you know?

237
00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:01.595
That stuff can help people look for us,

238
00:13:01.595 --> 00:13:04.195
like tell them where we are and stuff.

239
00:13:04.195 --> 00:13:05.895
What?

240
00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:08.495
I thought I saw it in a drama or something,

241
00:13:08.495 --> 00:13:11.095
so I broke it when we got on.

242
00:13:11.095 --> 00:13:14.195
Oh, really? Good job.

243
00:13:23.895 --> 00:13:24.995
There they are.

244
00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.395
300 meters ahead!

245
00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:27.695
We did it.

246
00:13:27.695 --> 00:13:29.695
You're not getting away.

247
00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:32.695
Candy.

248
00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:38.995
No joke!

249
00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:40.095
Oh, no!

250
00:13:40.095 --> 00:13:42.395
And we came all this way!

251
00:13:42.395 --> 00:13:43.495
Candy!

252
00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:47.695
"3:10 pm"

253
00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:50.295
"Time until explosion: 50 minutes"

254
00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:02.546
They're nowhere in sight.

255
00:14:02.546 --> 00:14:04.046
Darn!

256
00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:06.046
We almost caught up and yet.

257
00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:07.146
Candy!

258
00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:15.046
Mao, are you all right?

259
00:14:19.446 --> 00:14:20.946
Sorry to keep you waiting.

260
00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:22.146
-Doctor Agasa! -Doctor Agasa!

261
00:14:22.146 --> 00:14:24.246
Good timing.

262
00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:25.346
Hurry, Doctor Agasa.

263
00:14:25.346 --> 00:14:26.346
I know.

264
00:14:36.846 --> 00:14:39.446
So which way?

265
00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:44.946
There not here.

266
00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:47.046
Where'd they go?

267
00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:49.746
They may have taken a side road again.

268
00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:50.746
What?

269
00:14:50.746 --> 00:14:53.646
We've got no way of finding them, then!

270
00:14:53.646 --> 00:14:55.046
Now what?

271
00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:57.546
It's going to explode and 4:00 pm, isn't it?

272
00:14:57.546 --> 00:14:59.546
We've only got 40 minutes more.

273
00:14:59.546 --> 00:15:01.746
-What? -Bomb!

274
00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:04.946
Doctor...

275
00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:08.446
You didn't know about it?

276
00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:10.246
-What do you mean? -What do you mean?

277
00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:14.446
I guess there's no choice but to tell them about it.

278
00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:17.146
Yeah. The thing is...

279
00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:20.446
A time bomb's going to explode at 4:00 pm?

280
00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:23.946
Candy... What's going to happen to Candy?

281
00:15:23.946 --> 00:15:27.146
Boy! What're the police doing?

282
00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:28.946
Since they have the license plate number

283
00:15:28.946 --> 00:15:30.046
why don't they hurry up and pursue them

284
00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:31.846
or set up road blocks or something?

285
00:15:31.846 --> 00:15:33.146
What about the wireless?

286
00:15:33.146 --> 00:15:35.746
Why don't we try calling on them directly, and tell them that?

287
00:15:35.746 --> 00:15:38.346
It's dangerous because a bomb is loaded in the car.

288
00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:40.846
I'm sure they're doing all they can already.

289
00:15:40.846 --> 00:15:43.646
But the fact is, I'm sure it's pretty difficult to specify

290
00:15:43.646 --> 00:15:48.146
which of the many FOX courier delivery vans that are going around town

291
00:15:48.146 --> 00:15:49.846
is the one that's carrying the bomb.

292
00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:51.246
Besides, it seems that the culprits

293
00:15:51.246 --> 00:15:54.746
were listening to the wireless of the police to begin with.

294
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.546
If a checkpoint is carelessly set up or we call out to them by wireless,

295
00:15:57.546 --> 00:15:59.346
and they decide to abandon the car somewhere,

296
00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:00.646
it'll really be a problem.

297
00:16:00.646 --> 00:16:02.846
Then, what should we do?

298
00:16:02.846 --> 00:16:05.446
Candy. Candy.

299
00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:12.646
Sorry to keep you waiting, doggie!

300
00:16:14.746 --> 00:16:15.746
Cute.

301
00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:17.146
May I carry it?

302
00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:21.346
-So cute. -Okay, doggie, want to go?

303
00:16:21.346 --> 00:16:24.246
Hey, Ginji! Let's go!

304
00:16:24.246 --> 00:16:26.746
Come on, just a little while more.

305
00:16:26.746 --> 00:16:27.746
Geez.

306
00:16:28.746 --> 00:16:29.746
"3:30 pm"

307
00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:31.246
"Time until explosion: 30 minutes"

308
00:16:32.246 --> 00:16:34.646
Okay! I've got no other choice.

309
00:16:34.646 --> 00:16:37.046
You guys, wait here in the car.

310
00:16:38.046 --> 00:16:41.246
Doctor, standby so that you can move the car out right away.

311
00:16:41.246 --> 00:16:42.846
Okay.

312
00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:44.246
Wait, Conan!

313
00:16:44.246 --> 00:16:45.746
Hey, Conan!

314
00:16:45.746 --> 00:16:47.246
What're you going to do?

315
00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.046
Yes, Megure, here.

316
00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:52.346
This is Mouri.

317
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.146
Inspector, if I remember correctly,

318
00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:57.946
you said that the two were listening to police radio communication?

319
00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:00.946
Yeah, that's how we see it.

320
00:17:00.946 --> 00:17:05.046
If so, please do as I say from now.

321
00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:07.846
Yeah.

322
00:17:07.846 --> 00:17:09.346
What?

323
00:17:09.346 --> 00:17:11.746
But, that's...

324
00:17:13.946 --> 00:17:16.746
Okay, I got you.

325
00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:20.046
Connect me to the communication control center immediately!

326
00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:22.046
Contact Takagi and Chiba too!

327
00:17:24.246 --> 00:17:25.346
Roger!

328
00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:33.646
Are you men really from FOX courier?

329
00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:36.846
How come you're not wearing a uniform?

330
00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:39.046
The one with the FOX mark?

331
00:17:39.046 --> 00:17:40.446
Ginji, let's go!

332
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.446
Oh, no.

333
00:17:45.446 --> 00:17:48.246
If those kids notify the police...

334
00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:49.546
Kingo.

335
00:17:49.546 --> 00:17:51.446
If you speed like that, it won't be a laugh

336
00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.946
if you get caught for speeding.

337
00:17:54.946 --> 00:17:56.146
Oh, yeah.

338
00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:58.546
That's true.

339
00:17:58.546 --> 00:18:00.446
From The Metropolitan Police Department to all stations,

340
00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.946
perform checkpoints from the following areas.

341
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:05.246
All cars on the move, please take appropriate action.

342
00:18:05.246 --> 00:18:08.046
From the intersection of Inner Circular Route 3-Kurinishi-cho,

343
00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.546
to the intersection of Tenmondai Mae.

344
00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:10.746
Kinji.

345
00:18:10.746 --> 00:18:14.146
Map! The map!

346
00:18:14.146 --> 00:18:16.046
Looks bad, Kinji!

347
00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:18.346
If we keep going as is, well hit the checkpoint.

348
00:18:18.346 --> 00:18:20.846
What? Darn.

349
00:18:22.946 --> 00:18:25.546
If... if we go that way, we'll run into the next checkpoint.

350
00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:27.846
-Tell me earlier! -Go right here.

351
00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:31.946
Next, go left, then right!

352
00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:37.246
Next, right, no, I mean left!

353
00:18:37.246 --> 00:18:39.246
-Shape up! -The Haido intersection.

354
00:18:39.246 --> 00:18:40.446
Next, next...

355
00:18:40.446 --> 00:18:41.746
next, go left!

356
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.846
Okay!

357
00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:52.346
We did it! We got out of it!

358
00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:55.446
There are no more checkpoints, we've made it through!

359
00:19:02.146 --> 00:19:03.346
There she is!

360
00:19:03.346 --> 00:19:04.646
Candy!

361
00:19:04.646 --> 00:19:05.946
Oh, yeah.

362
00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:07.746
Just as would be expected of Conan.

363
00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.446
How did you do it?

364
00:19:09.446 --> 00:19:11.646
I had Pops Kogoro tell Inspector Megure

365
00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:15.546
to give out false checkpoint information.

366
00:19:15.546 --> 00:19:17.346
I see.

367
00:19:17.346 --> 00:19:20.246
And you gave out directions for a side street out

368
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:22.846
and lured them there.

369
00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:24.346
That's right.

370
00:19:25.446 --> 00:19:28.246
The FOX delivery van there, freeze!

371
00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:30.546
There!

372
00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:32.946
Watch out!

373
00:19:34.746 --> 00:19:36.146
Bye.

374
00:19:37.246 --> 00:19:38.246
"3:45 pm"

375
00:19:38.246 --> 00:19:39.746
"Time until explosion: 15 minutes"

376
00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:43.846
-It's not here. -It's not here...

377
00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:46.046
The bomb's still in the delivery van.

378
00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:47.046
What?

379
00:19:47.046 --> 00:19:48.446
Candy?

380
00:19:48.446 --> 00:19:50.446
Doctor, open the trunk!

381
00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:53.146
Hurry. Only 12 minutes to go.

382
00:20:01.846 --> 00:20:03.546
No.

383
00:20:03.546 --> 00:20:04.646
Not this either.

384
00:20:05.846 --> 00:20:08.946
Hey, so, you're Candy?

385
00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:11.446
Hey! What do you think you're doing, kid?

386
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.146
I found it.

387
00:20:15.146 --> 00:20:17.046
Darn, there's not enough time.

388
00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:19.646
I can't possibly throw it out in a place like this.

389
00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:22.946
Hey, sirs!

390
00:20:22.946 --> 00:20:25.946
Can you take me to some place spacious?

391
00:20:25.946 --> 00:20:27.346
This is a bomb!

392
00:20:27.346 --> 00:20:29.946
-Bomb? -Bomb?

393
00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:33.046
No way.

394
00:20:33.046 --> 00:20:34.746
Throw him out.

395
00:20:34.746 --> 00:20:36.546
Okay! Hey, Kinji.

396
00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:37.746
It's true!

397
00:20:37.746 --> 00:20:39.946
Two others were delivered by the delivery van

398
00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:41.746
and people have already gotten hurt too!

399
00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:43.546
This is the last one.

400
00:20:43.546 --> 00:20:46.046
It'll explode in a little while.

401
00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:59.246
Kid, hang onto something!

402
00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:00.946
Ginji! The map!

403
00:21:00.946 --> 00:21:02.146
Okay, Kinji!

404
00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:08.846
There's no place, none, nearby.

405
00:21:08.846 --> 00:21:10.346
Let me see.

406
00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:11.446
Two more minutes to go.

407
00:21:11.446 --> 00:21:12.746
I know!

408
00:21:12.746 --> 00:21:14.846
Where? Where are they?

409
00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:16.946
There they are!

410
00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:21.146
Go here!

411
00:21:22.446 --> 00:21:24.146
Darn.

412
00:21:24.146 --> 00:21:26.546
Where? Where are they?

413
00:21:26.546 --> 00:21:27.946
One minute to go.

414
00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:29.446
There's no more time.

415
00:21:29.446 --> 00:21:30.746
Don't give up.

416
00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:34.546
20 seconds to go.

417
00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:35.846
Where are you?

418
00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:37.046
10 seconds to go!

419
00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:42.946
-There they are! -Three,

420
00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:44.346
two, one.

421
00:21:51.546 --> 00:21:52.946
Oh, no.

422
00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:54.646
Too late.

423
00:22:00.146 --> 00:22:01.746
Awesome!

424
00:22:05.446 --> 00:22:07.146
That was close.

425
00:22:08.246 --> 00:22:09.446
Cut it out.

426
00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:12.846
Okay, okay.

427
00:22:12.846 --> 00:22:13.846
Candy.

428
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:24.046
-Candy. -The Youth Detective Squad does it again!

429
00:23:47.146 --> 00:23:49.746
Well, just as would be expected of Mouri.

430
00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:51.246
"Mouri Detective Agency" -It was fantastic.

431
00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:55.446
Well, I can't take anymore.

432
00:23:57.446 --> 00:24:01.246
Really! It's about time you got up, dad.

433
00:24:08.746 --> 00:24:11.746
He died of a traffice accident last year.

434
00:24:14.346 --> 00:24:16.846
-Awesome! -Awesome...

435
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:17.946
Thank you.

436
00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:20.846
But, father left saying that he was going to see you.

437
00:24:20.846 --> 00:24:23.246
Who I didn't see, I didn't see!

438
00:24:25.946 --> 00:24:28.846
To tell the truth, I saw it...

439
00:24:28.846 --> 00:24:31.346
The village head's ghost.

440
00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:32.746
Next Conan,

441
00:24:32.746 --> 00:24:36.846
"An Unsolvable Ice Trap".

442
00:24:52.646 --> 00:24:55.046
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:55.046 --> 00:24:56.846
"Will-o'-the-wisps".

444
00:24:56.846 --> 00:24:58.846
The Youth Detective Squad did it!

445
00:24:58.846 --> 00:25:00.246
Here's a prize candy for you.

446
00:25:00.246 --> 00:25:01.746
We've had enough candy already.
