1
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.240
Let's lift it up.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.240
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.940
So, this is Munch's "Despair".

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.940
Yes, and that's "Anxiety".

5
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.040
Who is the curator of the Suzuki Museum?

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.940
"Hiroshi Numajiri (35)" -Yes. I'm Numajiri.

7
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.440
These are the photos of "Despair" and "Anxiety"

8
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.040
that I took before boarding the plane.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740
Yes, I will confirm it.

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.040
"Scream" is going to arrive at Haneda Airport, right?

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.540
Since the art gallery that we're loaning it from is different,

12
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.340
the procedures are different, too.

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.140
What is Mr. Numajiri going to do?

14
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.740
He's going to check if there were any damages during transport

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.240
by checking them against the photos

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.740
that was taken before they were packed.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.040
With a camera like that, you can develop the picture right there.

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.540
You see, unlike digital cameras they're difficult to tamper with.

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.940
That's why they're still in use to this day.

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.340
Advisor.

21
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.040
No damages are seen on neither "Despair" nor "Anxiety".

22
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.240
Okay.

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940
Pack them.

24
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.940
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.940
Advisor, I'll head off to Haneda to check on "Scream".

26
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.440
I'm counting on you.

27
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.040
You really pack it securely, don't you?

28
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.740
Yes. They cost billions a piece...

29
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.140
Rather, tens of billions a piece.

30
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.440
Right, boss?

31
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.640
You're the boss.

32
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.140
Thanks for coming all this way.

33
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.240
Not at all.

34
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.440
"Keiji Shimamura (50)" -I really love Munch, you see.

35
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.840
To be able to transport three of his representative works,

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.740
I'm really honoured.

37
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.240
That truck is carrying "Anxiety" and "Despair" in it, right?

38
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.540
It sure sounds sort of sinister, though.

39
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.940
It's me.

40
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.740
I'm the curator, Numajiri.

41
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.440
Did "Scream" arrive safely?

42
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440
Yes.

43
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.340
I confirmed it, and there seemed to be no problem,

44
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.240
so it's headed over for the Suzuki Museum.

45
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.440
Good work.

46
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.240
You go on ahead, too.

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.440
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340
I knew about Munch's "Scream",

49
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.040
but as to "Anxiety" and "Despair", it's a first.

50
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.640
Well, Munch is well known for "Scream".

51
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.740
Munch himself seem to have favoured "Scream" too,

52
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.040
since he drew five of it

53
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.440
in oil paint, pastel paint, lithograph, and tempera painting.

54
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.340
You actually wanted to open a Munch exhibition

55
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.540
with all of the five "Scream" paintings. Right, sir?

56
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
But one of them is owned by an individual

57
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.240
and my hope of wanting to borrow it didn't work out.

58
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.940
That's why I decided to feature "Scream", "Despair" and "Anxiety"

59
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.040
to open my Munch exhibition.

60
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.840
Why did you choose those three?

61
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.040
You'll understand when the three are displayed together.

62
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.540
It's me.

63
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.640
Advisor! Bad news!

64
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.740
"Scream"!

65
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.240
"Scream" disappeared!

66
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.240
What?

67
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.340
Just what do you mean?

68
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.640
The car with "Scream" inside that was in front of us

69
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.440
suddenly went off route and disappeared!

70
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.840
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

71
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.740
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

72
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.540
In the movie it's Gogh and on TV it's Munch.

73
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.740
Solve the disasters of the masterpieces with deduction!

74
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.640
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:52.361
"Munch's Scream Disappears"

78
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.361
Hello?

79
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:56.561
Oh, advisor.

80
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.961
I just got a hold of the transport company a while ago.

81
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.961
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:05.161
No. The thing is, they say that they're moving along as scheduled.

83
00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:06.361
Yes.

84
00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:08.361
They seem to have left the checkpoint

85
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.261
just a while ago, a bit delayed.

86
00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:14.261
But Mr. Numajiri who was right behind them

87
00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:15.961
said that they went off route.

88
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:19.261
Yes, so I'll call Numajiri now.

89
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:20.661
Do that, will you?

90
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.561
What's a checkpoint?

91
00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:26.961
It's a place where the car is stopped once

92
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.861
to check if the loaded goods are okay.

93
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.061
Advisor!

94
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:40.761
Mr. Numajiri, you're here already.

95
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.461
And where's the "Scream"?

96
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:43.661
Not here yet.

97
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:47.461
I'm going to go check on "Despair" and "Anxiety".

98
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:49.061
Do that, will you?

99
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:51.161
I'll go over to the gallery head's office.

100
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.361
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:55.361
The photos of the package please.

102
00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:56.561
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:59.161 --> 00:07:02.261
Huh? I didn't notice it at the airport,

104
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:04.661
but the way it's packaged is different.

105
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:09.661
Maybe a different person packed it.

106
00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:13.961
Come to think of it, you weren't at Narita Airport, were you?

107
00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:17.761
No, we came from the checkpoint.

108
00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:21.361
So the packages of the paintings are confirmed there?

109
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.861
Yes. A person who has never touched the paintings till now does.

110
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.261
Do the drivers change there, too?

111
00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:30.461
Right, both of the drivers change.

112
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.661
But, if it was really stolen,

113
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:37.561
we've got to deal with it immediately.

114
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.261
But the transport company says

115
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:42.161
they're moving along as scheduled, aren't they?

116
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.561
But, advisor, it disappeared.

117
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.361
The car with "Scream" on it disappeared before my very eyes.

118
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:51.861
What about "Despair" and "Anxiety"?

119
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.761
They're fine.

120
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:55.261
Advisor.

121
00:07:55.261 --> 00:07:57.761
If "Scream" was really stolen,

122
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:00.161
it won't be just a problem of the money involved.

123
00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:01.161
True.

124
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:03.561
It could turn into an international issue.

125
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:06.361
Just one more.

126
00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.461
So, this is "Anxiety".

127
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:10.761
I don't understand.

128
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:14.261
What? "Scream" vanished?

129
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.461
Keep your voice down, Sonoko.

130
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.061
Shouldn't you call him?

131
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:20.561
The police?

132
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:21.761
No, silly.

133
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:23.161
I mean your boyfriend.

134
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.161
Your finger doesn't look to be right.

135
00:08:28.861 --> 00:08:31.861
You mean it was stolen?

136
00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:33.261
I don't know.

137
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:36.561
But, if it was, that's bad news.

138
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.861
Besides, something bothers me.

139
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:44.361
What on earth are you doing, Shinichi?

140
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:48.761
Dad?

141
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:51.461
If it had been stolen,

142
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:55.861
the more time it takes, the more fatal the result will be.

143
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:57.361
Advisor.

144
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:00.361
I think it's best to report this to the police.

145
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.861
Come in.

146
00:09:04.061 --> 00:09:05.561
Excuse me.

147
00:09:08.661 --> 00:09:11.961
I hear that there's been a problem?

148
00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:15.161
I'm sorry. I happened to hear your conversation a while ago.

149
00:09:15.161 --> 00:09:19.561
Sir, where is the driver that's transporting "Scream" now?

150
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.761
Advisor!

151
00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.861
"Scream"! "Scream" is here!

152
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:26.161
What?

153
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:34.361
Well?

154
00:09:34.361 --> 00:09:36.961
No problem, it's genuine.

155
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.261
Naturally.

156
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:41.961
I was shocked when I heard that it was stolen.

157
00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:45.261
But it was delayed more than 30 minutes,

158
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:47.661
anybody would be worried.

159
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:48.961
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:53.161
But it was also written in the contract

161
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:55.561
that there may be delays due to traffic conditions, too.

162
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.861
Of course I'm aware of that.

163
00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:01.861
We just made a big thing out of it and troubled you.

164
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:05.861
Why did you go off route anyway?

165
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:08.761
We were moving along just as the navigator indicated

166
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.661
so we weren't aware that we went off track at all.

167
00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:16.761
World famous masterpiece theft, my foot.

168
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.261
I'm apologizing, aren't I?

169
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:21.961
That's no attitude to take if apologizing.

170
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:24.261
Then, just what do you want me to do?

171
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:31.961
Kid, what are you doing?

172
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:36.061
This truck is the one that transported "Scream", right?

173
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:37.361
Right.

174
00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:39.161
With me driving it.

175
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:43.061
You drove all the way here looking at the navigator, right?

176
00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:44.261
Yes.

177
00:10:44.261 --> 00:10:47.661
While following the route the company gave me.

178
00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:50.161
Can I still see that route now?

179
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:54.261
Huh? The route is gone.

180
00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:58.161
Maybe your assistant Tanaka deleted it?

181
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:01.461
Navigators keep records of the roads

182
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.261
that you actually took, don't they?

183
00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:05.061
Yes.

184
00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:06.261
A history of the routes.

185
00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:09.361
From between here to here,

186
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:11.461
it looks like you warped or something.

187
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:15.761
This is "Satellite Lost".

188
00:11:15.761 --> 00:11:20.661
Car navigators receive waves from artificial satellites

189
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:24.361
and display their location on maps.

190
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:26.261
That's why if you move along places

191
00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:29.661
where waves are out of range for a long period of time,

192
00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:33.161
sometimes the route itself is not displayed.

193
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:35.561
That's what "Satellite Lost" is.

194
00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:41.661
You said you changed at the checkpoint a while ago, right?

195
00:11:41.661 --> 00:11:42.761
Yes.

196
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:45.161
Where was that checkpoint?

197
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:46.461
Let's see.

198
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:50.861
Just where satellite lost was around here.

199
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:55.061
Do you also take pictures at the checkpoint?

200
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:56.361
Of course.

201
00:11:56.361 --> 00:11:59.761
After the package is checked whether it's okay or not.

202
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.461
See.

203
00:12:01.461 --> 00:12:04.461
This is "Despair" and this is "Anxiety".

204
00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:05.761
Where's "Scream"?

205
00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:07.661
This is it.

206
00:12:12.561 --> 00:12:15.561
Do you unpack the goods at the checkpoint?

207
00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:17.061
No, we don't.

208
00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:21.061
Then, are these packed the way they were at the airport?

209
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:23.161
Well, I guess they're the same.

210
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:28.461
You know,

211
00:12:28.461 --> 00:12:30.061
don't you think these paintings are all of the same place?

212
00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:31.561
Exactly.

213
00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:34.761
All three paintings that have the same scenery as the background,

214
00:12:34.761 --> 00:12:37.361
were drawn with the same composition.

215
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:41.561
Almost like a 3-panel cartoon.

216
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:43.361
Good observation.

217
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:46.961
This is indeed the "triptych" I had in mind.

218
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:49.061
Triptych?

219
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:50.761
A group of three paintings

220
00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:52.861
are displayed together to mean something.

221
00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:54.061
I see.

222
00:12:54.061 --> 00:12:56.261
And? Did you figure anything out?

223
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:57.561
Sort of.

224
00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:00.861
I wonder why that man's screaming?

225
00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.861
He's not screaming.

226
00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:07.161
He hears a scream so he's covering his ears.

227
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:10.461
Who's scream did he hear?

228
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:13.961
Munch explains this work in his journal.

229
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.561
"The sky suddenly turned bloody red.

230
00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:20.361
That's when I saw

231
00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:24.261
the blazing clouds cover the blue town

232
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:27.861
with blood and blades.

233
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:35.061
The tongue of blaze and blood covered the bluish black fiord and town.

234
00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:40.661
I stopped in place, exhausted and leaned against a fence.

235
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:43.261
My friend walked off,

236
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:46.061
but I just stood in place there.

237
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:47.761
I was trembling with anxiety,

238
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:50.061
scared to my wits but battling with it.

239
00:13:50.061 --> 00:13:51.761
That's when I heard it.

240
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:56.861
A loud endless scream pierce through nature."

241
00:13:56.861 --> 00:14:03.361
It probably actually happened within Munch's troubled mind.

242
00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:06.361
The perpetrator left a record on the navigator

243
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:09.661
to make it look like what truly happened never happened at all.

244
00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:12.861
Hey, kids.

245
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:15.261
It's about time we get going home.

246
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.161
Shinichi.

247
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:25.261
Hello? Sorry.

248
00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:28.061
If it's about the call a while ago, it's already okay.

249
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:31.461
You mean about Munch's "Scream" being stolen, right?

250
00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:34.061
Why do you know about it?

251
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:35.661
But, sorry.

252
00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:37.561
That was a mistake.

253
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:40.961
No, it wasn't a mistake.

254
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.961
This was a crime.

255
00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:59.012
Everyone, thank you for taking time out to gather here.

256
00:15:00.012 --> 00:15:04.012
Please take a good look at the photos that will be shown from now.

257
00:15:04.012 --> 00:15:07.412
These are photos of when "Despair" and "Anxiety"

258
00:15:07.412 --> 00:15:09.312
were packaged at Narita Airport.

259
00:15:10.312 --> 00:15:12.212
Next is the photo of "Scream"

260
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:15.012
when it was packed at Haneda Airport.

261
00:15:15.012 --> 00:15:16.112
If you take a good look,

262
00:15:16.112 --> 00:15:19.712
you can see that "Despair" and "Anxiety" that were packed

263
00:15:19.712 --> 00:15:23.412
at Narita Airport in a different way.

264
00:15:23.412 --> 00:15:27.412
That's probably because the person who packed it was different.

265
00:15:27.412 --> 00:15:32.412
Then, who packed "Despair" at Narita Airport?

266
00:15:32.412 --> 00:15:38.112
"Despair" was packed by the boss and his employee.

267
00:15:38.112 --> 00:15:41.512
"Anxiety" was packed only by the employee.

268
00:15:41.512 --> 00:15:45.512
Then, please look at "Scream" that was packed at Haneda Airport.

269
00:15:48.112 --> 00:15:50.412
It's packed the same way.

270
00:15:50.412 --> 00:15:51.412
Right.

271
00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:55.312
Why were "Despair" and "Scream"

272
00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:58.912
that were at airports distance apart packaged in the same way?

273
00:15:58.912 --> 00:16:02.812
That's probably because the employee at Haneda

274
00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:06.512
coincidentally happened to pack the drawing like me.

275
00:16:06.512 --> 00:16:07.812
I see.

276
00:16:07.812 --> 00:16:10.912
Then, the driver who transported "Scream".

277
00:16:10.912 --> 00:16:12.112
Yes?

278
00:16:12.112 --> 00:16:16.912
Who confirmed the package of "Scream" at the checkpoint?

279
00:16:16.912 --> 00:16:20.812
It was President Shimamura.

280
00:16:20.812 --> 00:16:22.412
Are you sure?

281
00:16:22.412 --> 00:16:23.712
Yes.

282
00:16:23.712 --> 00:16:26.112
When I came to change shifts,

283
00:16:26.112 --> 00:16:29.712
the president was carefully checking the package.

284
00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:30.812
What about the drivers

285
00:16:30.812 --> 00:16:34.112
that brought the painting up to the checkpoint?

286
00:16:34.112 --> 00:16:36.312
They seem to have gone off to their next job,

287
00:16:36.312 --> 00:16:37.912
and weren't there anymore.

288
00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:38.912
In other words,

289
00:16:38.912 --> 00:16:41.512
President Shimamura was checking the package all by himself

290
00:16:41.512 --> 00:16:46.012
until you all showed up?

291
00:16:46.012 --> 00:16:47.512
Exactly.

292
00:16:47.512 --> 00:16:49.012
Any problem with that?

293
00:16:49.012 --> 00:16:50.112
It concerned me

294
00:16:50.112 --> 00:16:53.712
when I heard that the drivers change at the checkpoint.

295
00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.312
It's not such a long distance,

296
00:16:55.312 --> 00:16:59.712
and yet the drivers change. Is it really necessary?

297
00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:01.512
That's...

298
00:17:01.512 --> 00:17:04.612
Now, please look at the navigator that she is holding.

299
00:17:05.812 --> 00:17:08.012
We insisted and had a driver

300
00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:10.812
export the data for us a while ago.

301
00:17:10.812 --> 00:17:14.612
Will you tell us where the checkpoint was?

302
00:17:14.612 --> 00:17:17.312
The place where there was satellite lost.

303
00:17:17.312 --> 00:17:18.412
I see.

304
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.812
Satellite was lost.

305
00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:23.412
In other words, the car that "Scream" was on,

306
00:17:23.412 --> 00:17:27.912
could've gone off route just about here?

307
00:17:28.812 --> 00:17:32.312
I was behind them and that's where I lost track of them.

308
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:35.012
Huh? You were behind them?

309
00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.712
Hold it!

310
00:17:36.712 --> 00:17:38.812
Something's wrong there.

311
00:17:38.812 --> 00:17:40.512
If they went off route here,

312
00:17:40.512 --> 00:17:43.312
they couldn't have made it to the checkpoint.

313
00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:44.912
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

314
00:17:44.912 --> 00:17:47.012
Exactly.

315
00:17:47.012 --> 00:17:51.612
However, the packaging of "Scream" was checked.

316
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.212
Just what's going on?

317
00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:54.312
In other words,

318
00:17:54.312 --> 00:17:59.312
the checkpoint was at a location off-route to begin with.

319
00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.612
What?

320
00:18:01.612 --> 00:18:03.512
Then, will the two drivers

321
00:18:03.512 --> 00:18:06.612
take everyone to where that checkpoint is.

322
00:18:06.612 --> 00:18:07.712
-Huh? -Huh?

323
00:18:13.912 --> 00:18:15.512
Conan?

324
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:18.212
So, you were with Shinichi after all, weren't you?

325
00:18:18.212 --> 00:18:20.412
Where's Shinichi?

326
00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:23.112
He left saying he had another case to take care of.

327
00:18:23.112 --> 00:18:24.212
What?

328
00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:25.712
He left?

329
00:18:25.712 --> 00:18:27.912
How irresponsible can he get?

330
00:18:27.912 --> 00:18:29.312
You can say that again.

331
00:18:29.312 --> 00:18:33.612
After we brought everybody over to the president's house.

332
00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:37.112
The president's house?

333
00:18:37.112 --> 00:18:39.712
Just what on earth is going on?

334
00:18:39.712 --> 00:18:41.412
Shinichi said

335
00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:46.612
Pops Kogoro already knows what's going on, so to ask him.

336
00:18:46.612 --> 00:18:48.812
Is that right, Dad?

337
00:18:48.812 --> 00:18:51.312
Well...

338
00:18:52.812 --> 00:18:55.012
The Sleeping Kogoro!

339
00:18:55.012 --> 00:18:57.112
"Despair" and "Anxiety".

340
00:18:57.112 --> 00:19:00.112
Now, the drivers who transported "Scream".

341
00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:03.212
This is the checkpoint, correct?

342
00:19:03.212 --> 00:19:05.012
Yes.

343
00:19:05.012 --> 00:19:06.812
I'm sure.

344
00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.012
But...

345
00:19:08.012 --> 00:19:10.712
I had no idea it was the president's residence.

346
00:19:10.712 --> 00:19:11.712
In other words,

347
00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:13.412
from the airport to the museum,

348
00:19:13.412 --> 00:19:15.912
it was the first time you took this road.

349
00:19:15.912 --> 00:19:19.612
You probably chose those kinds of drivers to begin with, no?

350
00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:22.412
President Shimamura!

351
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:28.112
You probably knew that within a certain range,

352
00:19:28.112 --> 00:19:32.112
including where your house is located, the satellite would be lost.

353
00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:36.012
That's why you registered the route

354
00:19:36.012 --> 00:19:38.412
where there would be satellite lost beforehand

355
00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:40.712
into the navigator.

356
00:19:41.912 --> 00:19:43.212
If you set it so that once they reached the destination

357
00:19:43.212 --> 00:19:45.712
it would automatically delete,

358
00:19:45.712 --> 00:19:47.412
there would be no evidence left either.

359
00:19:48.212 --> 00:19:51.812
The only thing left would be the record of satellite lost.

360
00:19:51.812 --> 00:19:56.312
That's how the president opened the package of "Scream" here

361
00:19:56.312 --> 00:19:59.212
and repacked it.

362
00:19:59.212 --> 00:20:02.112
That's why the packing method was the same.

363
00:20:02.112 --> 00:20:05.712
But, why did you do something like this?

364
00:20:05.712 --> 00:20:07.512
That's because...

365
00:20:08.912 --> 00:20:11.712
Mr. Shimamura, delivery.

366
00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:13.012
What is it?

367
00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:15.512
Mr. Shimamura!

368
00:20:17.512 --> 00:20:20.512
Mr. Shimamura, I'm sorry.

369
00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:21.712
I accepted it and opened it.

370
00:20:25.612 --> 00:20:26.612
What?

371
00:20:31.312 --> 00:20:34.112
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:35.312 --> 00:20:36.712
I see.

373
00:20:36.712 --> 00:20:40.412
You unpacked it to take a picture of this.

374
00:20:40.412 --> 00:20:43.412
I love Munch.

375
00:20:43.412 --> 00:20:45.312
Especially "Scream".

376
00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:49.712
That's why when I got this job to transport the real "Scream",

377
00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:52.712
I couldn't suppress the urge to hang it in my house

378
00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:56.112
and take a picture of it.

379
00:22:20.612 --> 00:22:23.612
But this is a grave issue.

380
00:22:23.612 --> 00:22:25.212
I'm very sorry!

381
00:22:25.212 --> 00:22:28.012
This is really no good, president.

382
00:22:28.012 --> 00:22:31.112
This is apparently a criminal case.

383
00:22:31.112 --> 00:22:32.612
Let's report this.

384
00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:33.912
Hold it.

385
00:22:33.912 --> 00:22:35.512
President Shimamura.

386
00:22:35.512 --> 00:22:38.412
The picture that is on the wall behind you.

387
00:22:38.412 --> 00:22:40.612
That picture of the sunflower, what is it?

388
00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:46.012
This is the first sunflower that Gogh drew in Arles.

389
00:22:46.012 --> 00:22:49.012
I used to work in the States when I was young.

390
00:22:49.012 --> 00:22:50.812
I was allowed to take this photo

391
00:22:50.812 --> 00:22:53.112
as thanks for transporting the work.

392
00:22:53.112 --> 00:22:56.412
In other words, you know the person

393
00:22:56.412 --> 00:22:58.612
who owns that sunflower painting.

394
00:22:58.612 --> 00:23:00.112
Yes.

395
00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.112
I'm still on a friendly terms.

396
00:23:03.112 --> 00:23:05.312
All right, then.

397
00:23:05.312 --> 00:23:07.112
I am soon going to be collecting

398
00:23:07.112 --> 00:23:11.112
Gogh's Sunflowers scattered throughout the world,

399
00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:15.112
and open a exhibition of the six sunflower paintings.

400
00:23:15.112 --> 00:23:17.912
Therefore, when I hold this event,

401
00:23:17.912 --> 00:23:20.312
I would like you to ask the owner

402
00:23:20.312 --> 00:23:23.312
to borrow it to me.

403
00:23:23.312 --> 00:23:25.512
If you grant me my wish,

404
00:23:25.512 --> 00:23:27.212
I will not make an issue of the insolent action

405
00:23:27.212 --> 00:23:29.212
that you have taken this time.

406
00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:30.512
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:30.512 --> 00:23:31.912
I'll be glad to.

408
00:23:31.912 --> 00:23:34.712
Case closed!

409
00:23:38.812 --> 00:23:41.712
That Sunflower exhibition of the six sunflowers

410
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:44.312
is going to be held in Japan

411
00:23:44.312 --> 00:23:47.912
as "Sunflowers Long for Japan Exhibition".

412
00:23:47.912 --> 00:23:49.712
But we'll get to that some time later.

413
00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:53.212
"Next Episode" -Hello? Hello?

414
00:23:53.212 --> 00:23:55.812
Mouri, answer me! Mouri!

415
00:23:56.812 --> 00:23:59.112
It seems definite that Pops was here.

416
00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:03.312
Police! Nobody move!

417
00:24:05.712 --> 00:24:08.612
That blueprint was the escape route after all.

418
00:24:15.012 --> 00:24:17.112
Next Conan,

419
00:24:17.112 --> 00:24:21.012
"The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 1)"

420
00:24:36.712 --> 00:24:38.812
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:38.812 --> 00:24:41.212
"Infiltration"

422
00:24:41.212 --> 00:24:42.512
Munch was safe and sound...

423
00:24:42.512 --> 00:24:45.112
But, as for Gogh's Sunflower, we've yet to know.
