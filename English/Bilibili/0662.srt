1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.440
Pops is helping an elderly for free?

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.040
According to Mrs. Takae Kiritani who is the landlady of an apartment,

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.140
Pops visits her every week

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.940
and seems to be helping out with any problem or trouble

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.640
the people of the neighborhood may have.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.840
Although Ran and I found it hard to believe,

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.940
we waited for him to come over to Mrs. Kiritani's house.

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.840
But the man who appeared, Ryohei Onda

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.840
"Ryohei Onda (21)" -was nowhere close to resembling Pops.

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.040
He turns out to be the boyfriend

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.440
of Mrs. Kiritani's granddaughter who was worried about her,

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.940
so he posed as Pops' imposter to keep watch over her.

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040
Although the case of Pops' imposter was easily solved,

14
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.840
the real case was just about to begin.

15
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.540
A scream was suddenly heard from the apartment building next door.

16
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.040
When we rushed over, we found the resident of the apartment room,

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.840
Mr. Gensuke Denkawa had bled to death.

18
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.340
The other residents of the apartment

19
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.240
were the ones who screamed when they found the corpse.

20
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.740
The victim died the night before that.

21
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.240
Judging from the circumstances, it was first thought to be suicide.

22
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.940
But it's not. This is a homicide!

23
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.140
And the killer is one of the three residents

24
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.540
who discovered the corpse.

25
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.540
If all cases were men,

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.340
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

27
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.340
Even a fake Kogoro can make perfect deductions.

28
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.340
The mysteries behind the Death case are solved.

29
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.940
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.879
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 2)"

33
00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.179
"Junji Hyodo (28), Apartment Resident" -Hey!

34
00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.879
Can we go now, officer?

35
00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.479
"Kumi Bannai (22), Apartment Resident" -We've already found out that

36
00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.379
the channel couldn't have been changed unless Mr. Denkawa was alive.

37
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.379
"Ken Ishigame (64), Apartment Resident" -Isn't it about time

38
00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.279
you let us go back to our rooms?

39
00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.379
Oh, but we haven't solved the problem about...

40
00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.479
That's not our problem!

41
00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.179
We just came back from the hot spring, and we are tired!

42
00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.479
So...

43
00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.679
That's enough, all of you!

44
00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.979
Interrupting someone when they're talking

45
00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.979
is nothing but plain arguing!

46
00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.979
"Takae Kiritani (70)" -If you have something to say,

47
00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.079
"Apartment Landlady" -do so after you hear the other person out!

48
00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.279
Step aside, will you?

49
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.679
That goes for you too, officer.

50
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.179
There's a detective right before your eyes,

51
00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.279
so why don't you ask him for his opinion?

52
00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:17.479
Well...

53
00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.679
Satisfying your own pride isn't going to get you anywhere.

54
00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:24.179
Oh, no. Hold it there, mother.

55
00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:25.579
"Mother"?

56
00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.579
Oh... No, no. I mean granny.

57
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.179
You see, I haven't gotten my deduction together yet.

58
00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:36.479
The landlady has a loud voice, doesn't she?

59
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.079
Yeah, but many elderly people are like that.

60
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.079
But that's because when they get older,

61
00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.479
it becomes more difficult for them to hear, right?

62
00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.279
The landlady seems to be able to hear us normally, doesn't she?

63
00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.179
That's true.

64
00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:54.079
Well, I hear there are older people who want to portray

65
00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.979
that they are young, alive and kicking by raising their voices.

66
00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.979
You see?

67
00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.879
Oh. It sounds like a phone call.

68
00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.079
Hello. Hello?

69
00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:12.079
That's strange. It's not connected.

70
00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:14.879
Maybe you got an e-mail? Please show me.

71
00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.079
Okay.

72
00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:20.279
Oh, my. You're good at it, little boy.

73
00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.879
My granddaughter taught me how to use it,

74
00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.579
but I just can't seem to remember the functions of the buttons.

75
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:29.279
I think if it was some time ago,

76
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.779
you could've remembered it like you do the keys of the piano.

77
00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.579
I guess so.

78
00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:36.479
Piano?

79
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.879
An e-mail from her granddaughter?

80
00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.479
No way.

81
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.779
Because of her husband's work...

82
00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.879
Her granddaughter is married?

83
00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:50.079
She even has a child, and she doesn't look like a university student.

84
00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:54.179
So, when he said he was the boyfriend of the landlady's granddaughter,

85
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:55.779
it was totally a lie.

86
00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.279
Then, who on earth is he?

87
00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.279
The mail's from your granddaughter.

88
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.679
Oh, it's from her?

89
00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:06.379
Granddaughter?

90
00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:07.979
Let's put that aside.

91
00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.679
Do you remember what time was it when the zapping happened

92
00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:13.079
at your house last night, landlady?

93
00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.579
Well. I think it was around sunset.

94
00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.779
Do you mean the channels changed one after another,

95
00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.079
paused for a while

96
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.479
and then continued changing again?

97
00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.179
Right, that's right. That's how it was.

98
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:30.679
That's why I thought some bad vibes came in from outside.

99
00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.579
More so because it stopped when I closed the curtains by the window.

100
00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:35.479
Just as I thought.

101
00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.479
I've figured out the trick.

102
00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.079
And the one who did it is probably that person.

103
00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:43.079
But I have no proof.

104
00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:44.479
If my deduction is correct,

105
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.379
the culprit should still be holding the evidence.

106
00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.379
Hey, we're getting nowhere like this.

107
00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.779
So I think we should...

108
00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.579
"Kogoro Mouri"

109
00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:01.579
Ask Detective Mouri, who is a professional

110
00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:05.379
at solving criminal cases to deduce this case.

111
00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.179
I think so, too.

112
00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:10.379
-I agree. -What?

113
00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.779
Why not? Let Detective Mouri handle this case alone.

114
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:16.979
No...

115
00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.179
So, how about it? Mr. Sleeping Kogoro!

116
00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:24.779
If this is a homicide and the culprit is among one of us,

117
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.179
-don't you think it's strange? -Right!

118
00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:29.679
What was that loud sound

119
00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:31.879
that we heard from the TV back then

120
00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.379
when we were just about to leave for the hot spring?

121
00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:37.779
Not only the sound. The channel was being changed too,

122
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:41.379
and he turned off the TV when we told him to.

123
00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:45.879
So, Denkawa should still be alive then, right?

124
00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:50.279
Mr. Denkawa died last night, didn't he?

125
00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.079
If so, there's no way that the culprit could be any of us

126
00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.279
who just got back from the hot spring a while ago.

127
00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.379
If you want to detain us any longer,

128
00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:01.779
then solve the case with the famous deduction that you're so proud of.

129
00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:04.179
I... I still haven't...

130
00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:05.879
Listen here.

131
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.979
Even if Detective Mouri can't solve the case,

132
00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:12.979
we have no intention of letting the three of you go just yet.

133
00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:14.479
When you broke down the door,

134
00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.079
one of you threw the key near the corpse

135
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:20.479
and tried to make it look like this was a locked room.

136
00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.979
This hasn't been cleared yet, you know.

137
00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:24.179
Don't you think that's strange, too?

138
00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:27.679
The police are always so reliant on Detective Mouri,

139
00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:30.879
and yet you're ignoring him this time.

140
00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.079
Don't tell me that the police are using Kogoro Mouri's imposter

141
00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:39.279
as a means to get something out of us?

142
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:44.179
What are you saying? He's the real Detective Mouri!

143
00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.779
Would you like me to disclose to everyone that he's an imposter?

144
00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:49.579
But... But I promised Ran...

145
00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:51.779
Forget the promise!

146
00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:54.479
This guy lied to us that he's acting as dad's imposter

147
00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:57.279
because the landlady's granddaughter asked him to do so.

148
00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:00.079
We don't know what he's up to!

149
00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:01.779
Well...

150
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.179
Then, I will do as you please.

151
00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:08.879
I, Kogoro Mouri shall reveal the truth behind this case.

152
00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:13.879
Very interesting.

153
00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:16.779
No. That wasn't me, you see.

154
00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:20.679
Hey, you're taking it too far despite being an imposter.

155
00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:24.979
I'll help you, then, Pops.

156
00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:26.879
Wait... What...

157
00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:28.479
Don't worry.

158
00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:31.479
I called the real Pops just a while ago,

159
00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:34.579
and he told me the truth behind the case.

160
00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:36.979
Play along with me, okay?

161
00:09:36.979 --> 00:09:39.079
Conan!

162
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.879
Yes, okay!

163
00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:44.879
I'll try asking the officers to do as you say, Pops!

164
00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:46.979
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

165
00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:49.979
Conan, no. He's not...

166
00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.079
Help me too, Ran!

167
00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:56.079
It seems he wants us to borrow a lot of things!

168
00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:58.079
Conan?

169
00:09:58.079 --> 00:09:59.679
Don't worry.

170
00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:03.379
Because the real Sleeping Kogoro is right here with us!

171
00:10:14.537 --> 00:10:17.437
Hey. Just how long are they going to make us wait?

172
00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:21.037
It seems that they're bringing a lot of things into the room.

173
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:25.037
It's pointless using devices that weren't originally in this room.

174
00:10:25.037 --> 00:10:28.137
We've only brought the same items as the ones that were in the room.

175
00:10:28.137 --> 00:10:29.837
We were told not to use things

176
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:32.237
that were left in the room to test the trick.

177
00:10:32.237 --> 00:10:35.437
The forensic officers who took the corpse away told us so.

178
00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:36.937
A trick?

179
00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:39.537
You're still saying things like that?

180
00:10:39.537 --> 00:10:42.137
What do you have to say?

181
00:10:42.137 --> 00:10:44.537
No... Well...

182
00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:47.237
Don't worry!

183
00:10:47.237 --> 00:10:50.337
Just say it like I told you, and it'll be okay.

184
00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:52.137
Don't flinch.

185
00:10:54.037 --> 00:10:57.237
Make them believe that you're Sherlock Holmes.

186
00:10:59.437 --> 00:11:01.137
How about it?

187
00:11:02.137 --> 00:11:04.637
Hello! It's July 2nd, Monday.

188
00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:07.437
This is the 9 o'clock evening news.

189
00:11:07.437 --> 00:11:10.237
Who turned on the TV?

190
00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:11.537
Beats me.

191
00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.937
But it's not one of us for sure.

192
00:11:13.937 --> 00:11:17.137
Maybe somebody's still in the other room?

193
00:11:17.137 --> 00:11:18.637
No, there isn't anyone.

194
00:11:18.637 --> 00:11:21.937
Well, you can turn on the TV if you set the timer.

195
00:11:21.937 --> 00:11:23.637
Just what are you talking about?

196
00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:25.937
Now, here's the third question!

197
00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:27.637
He hit it! It's a big one!

198
00:11:27.637 --> 00:11:29.237
It's zapping.

199
00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:31.237
What... What's going on?

200
00:11:32.337 --> 00:11:35.137
Somebody is actually in the room, right?

201
00:11:35.137 --> 00:11:38.337
-Wait! -Today is Christmas!

202
00:11:38.337 --> 00:11:40.737
It's no surprise that a miracle may occur.

203
00:11:40.737 --> 00:11:43.237
Fry the onion until it becomes brownish.

204
00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:45.637
Big Osaka takes the lead, thanks to Higo's goal.

205
00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:47.937
This is a homicide.

206
00:11:47.937 --> 00:11:51.137
The remote controller of the TV is on the fan.

207
00:11:51.137 --> 00:11:52.937
I... I see!

208
00:11:52.937 --> 00:11:55.937
The clothes pin held down the channel button of the remote controller

209
00:11:55.937 --> 00:11:59.937
that was fixed onto the fan with its neck facing downwards!

210
00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:05.237
This way, each time the neck of the fan swings

211
00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:07.137
and turns towards the TV,

212
00:12:07.137 --> 00:12:11.637
the channel changes and it will sound like it's zapping.

213
00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:13.237
I see.

214
00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:16.337
The TV switched on because the programs were preset.

215
00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:17.637
If it were a news program,

216
00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:20.637
others would think that it was airing in real time.

217
00:12:20.637 --> 00:12:21.937
If the timer of the fan

218
00:12:21.937 --> 00:12:24.437
was set to turn on two to three minutes later

219
00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:26.837
and the neck starts to swing,

220
00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:29.537
it would sound like zapping.

221
00:12:29.537 --> 00:12:32.437
But, how was the TV turned off?

222
00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:36.737
We certainly heard the TV being switched off.

223
00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:39.037
I think it was turned off using the off timer of the TV.

224
00:12:39.037 --> 00:12:42.237
Idiot! If the TV was preset to switch on,

225
00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:44.437
it should've been off till then.

226
00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:47.937
And if the TV isn't on, the off timer doesn't work.

227
00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:49.137
So he says.

228
00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:51.937
Right. That's...

229
00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.737
Don't worry.

230
00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:00.737
How was that done, Mr. Mouri?

231
00:13:04.137 --> 00:13:05.837
As you can see,

232
00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:11.137
another fan besides the one with the swinging neck was used.

233
00:13:11.137 --> 00:13:12.837
The on-off switch of a TV remote controller

234
00:13:12.837 --> 00:13:14.837
was held down by a clothes pin on this other fan.

235
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:17.237
Then, the other remote controller was placed on the stand of this fan

236
00:13:17.237 --> 00:13:19.137
and turned towards the TV.

237
00:13:19.137 --> 00:13:23.437
A leaflet was placed in front of the stand of the fan.

238
00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:26.537
All that needs to be done after that is to set it so that this fan

239
00:13:26.537 --> 00:13:30.837
would switch on a few minutes after the fan with the swinging neck.

240
00:13:30.837 --> 00:13:33.437
The leaflet would be blown away by the wind,

241
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:36.337
and the sensor of the remote controller would no longer be blocked.

242
00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:39.337
Thus, the TV would be switched off.

243
00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:41.237
It would give off the impression

244
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.937
that someone had been watching TV while zapping,

245
00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:47.637
but turned off the TV after getting complaints.

246
00:13:47.637 --> 00:13:49.837
That's why the leaflet was found on the mattress.

247
00:13:49.837 --> 00:13:52.237
By the way, the fan was operating for a while

248
00:13:52.237 --> 00:13:54.837
even after the TV was switched off.

249
00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:56.737
And since the model of the TV was coincidentally

250
00:13:56.737 --> 00:14:00.537
the same as the one of the landlady's,

251
00:14:00.537 --> 00:14:04.737
each time the fan turned towards her house,

252
00:14:04.737 --> 00:14:08.237
it caused the TV in her living room to start zapping, too.

253
00:14:08.237 --> 00:14:11.637
So, it wasn't caused by the books on the table?

254
00:14:11.637 --> 00:14:15.237
No. It was a side effect of the trick the culprit used.

255
00:14:15.237 --> 00:14:18.037
But who on earth would've schemed such a trick?

256
00:14:18.037 --> 00:14:22.137
When we came into this room, there was no such set up.

257
00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:24.237
Can't you see?

258
00:14:24.237 --> 00:14:29.937
The remote controller of the TV is fixed to the fan with band aids.

259
00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:32.237
If I remember correctly,

260
00:14:32.237 --> 00:14:35.237
you said you fell when you tripped over the corpse's foot, right?

261
00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:37.337
So what?

262
00:14:37.337 --> 00:14:40.737
Don't tell me you removed the band aid from the fan

263
00:14:40.737 --> 00:14:42.737
-and stuck it on yourself? -It's because I was bit

264
00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:44.437
by a mosquito at the hot spring!

265
00:14:44.437 --> 00:14:47.137
I showed it to you on the train when we came back, didn't I?

266
00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:50.537
But I can't tell if it's the same band aid I saw back then.

267
00:14:50.537 --> 00:14:52.937
You thought the culprit used it to commit the crime,

268
00:14:52.937 --> 00:14:55.337
so you fixed it on with the band aid, right?

269
00:14:55.337 --> 00:14:56.537
No.

270
00:14:56.537 --> 00:14:58.737
It probably only took you all about 10 seconds

271
00:14:58.737 --> 00:15:02.137
to bust the door open, turn on the light

272
00:15:02.137 --> 00:15:04.237
and discover Mr. Denkawa's corpse.

273
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.637
I wanted to try and see

274
00:15:07.637 --> 00:15:10.437
if you could stick another band aid on in such little time,

275
00:15:10.437 --> 00:15:13.337
so I intentionally used a band aid.

276
00:15:13.337 --> 00:15:15.037
Very well, Officer Takagi.

277
00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:17.437
I will turn my back for 10 seconds,

278
00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:19.537
so can you try it?

279
00:15:19.537 --> 00:15:21.337
Yes.

280
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.237
10, 9, 8...

281
00:15:24.237 --> 00:15:27.237
7, 6, 5...

282
00:15:27.237 --> 00:15:29.237
4, 3...

283
00:15:29.237 --> 00:15:32.737
2, 1, 0!

284
00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:34.537
-Wait. -How did it go?

285
00:15:34.537 --> 00:15:36.737
-Did you stick it on? -No.

286
00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:38.437
I was able to stick it on,

287
00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.737
but it's all wrinkled as I was rushing.

288
00:15:40.737 --> 00:15:43.637
The culprit could've had more time than that.

289
00:15:43.637 --> 00:15:48.037
Mr. Ishigame was having trouble turning the light on right away.

290
00:15:48.037 --> 00:15:51.037
It would be the same even if more time was available.

291
00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:54.937
Because it would've already been dim before the light was switched on.

292
00:15:54.937 --> 00:15:57.837
Judging from the way Mrs. Bannai was operating her cell phone,

293
00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:00.737
she is likely right-handed.

294
00:16:00.737 --> 00:16:03.837
It's tough to neatly stick something on her right elbow and finger

295
00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:06.637
using her left hand that she normally wouldn't use.

296
00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:10.837
The same goes for the compress that Mr. Ishigami has

297
00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.737
on his right shoulder.

298
00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:15.937
The same method is used when applying a compress and a band aid,

299
00:16:15.937 --> 00:16:18.237
but it would be impossible to peel off either one

300
00:16:18.237 --> 00:16:20.837
and stick it back on nicely without being seen by anyone.

301
00:16:20.837 --> 00:16:24.237
Of course, instead of sticking the band aid or the compress back on,

302
00:16:24.237 --> 00:16:28.237
the culprit could also have crumpled it up and hid it in the pocket.

303
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.037
But under such a circumstance

304
00:16:30.037 --> 00:16:33.037
where it's very likely that the police would carry out a body check,

305
00:16:33.037 --> 00:16:36.537
it is difficult to think that the culprit would hide it like that.

306
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.337
The only option left is something

307
00:16:38.337 --> 00:16:40.437
that won't arouse suspicion even if it's somewhere on the person,

308
00:16:40.437 --> 00:16:43.137
as well as something that is very easy to retrieve.

309
00:16:43.137 --> 00:16:44.637
Mr. Hyodo.

310
00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:47.437
That hair band that you used to tie your hair a while back

311
00:16:47.437 --> 00:16:50.937
is the only possible answer!

312
00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:55.537
If you use it as you can see right now.

313
00:16:55.537 --> 00:16:58.137
It works seemingly well!

314
00:16:58.137 --> 00:16:59.837
You tied your hair up on the spur of the moment

315
00:16:59.837 --> 00:17:02.537
to make it difficult to check on later, isn't that right?

316
00:17:02.537 --> 00:17:04.137
Well...

317
00:17:04.137 --> 00:17:05.837
He's really going for it.

318
00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:08.537
He's an imposter and yet he looks so genuine.

319
00:17:08.537 --> 00:17:10.737
No. Maybe he's even more detective-like

320
00:17:10.737 --> 00:17:12.937
because he's not asleep.

321
00:17:12.937 --> 00:17:14.837
The key to using the trick is

322
00:17:14.837 --> 00:17:16.937
how quickly the culprit could erase traces of the trick

323
00:17:16.937 --> 00:17:22.137
and retrieve the tools used to carry it out after entering the room.

324
00:17:22.137 --> 00:17:24.637
Since you were the one who entered the room first

325
00:17:24.637 --> 00:17:27.737
to turn off the alarm clock,

326
00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:30.137
you could remove the remote controller from the fan

327
00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:33.337
after bumping into it and knocking it over.

328
00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:35.837
If you bend down in order to stop the alarm,

329
00:17:35.837 --> 00:17:37.337
you could also remove the clothes pin

330
00:17:37.337 --> 00:17:40.537
that held down the remote controller without being suspected

331
00:17:40.537 --> 00:17:42.337
as well as remove the hair band

332
00:17:42.337 --> 00:17:45.737
that was hooked onto the back of the fan, right?

333
00:17:45.737 --> 00:17:50.737
But, did you witness me doing that or not?

334
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.537
I'm asking if you have proof

335
00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:56.137
that I used my hair band to carry out that trick!

336
00:17:56.137 --> 00:17:58.037
Proof?

337
00:17:58.037 --> 00:18:01.337
Come to think of it, I haven't told him anything about that.

338
00:18:01.337 --> 00:18:04.537
If I remember correctly, there was blood

339
00:18:04.537 --> 00:18:06.237
on one of the remote controllers, right?

340
00:18:06.237 --> 00:18:10.337
Yeah. It looked like the blood was scraped.

341
00:18:10.337 --> 00:18:13.237
In other words, if traces of the scrape touched

342
00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:16.937
the hair band you used to attach the remote controller onto the fan,

343
00:18:16.937 --> 00:18:18.737
it would stain the hair band, right?

344
00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:23.537
The blood that splattered when you slashed Mr. Denkawa's neck

345
00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:25.937
should also show up on your hair band.

346
00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:30.237
Hearing those words,

347
00:18:30.237 --> 00:18:32.637
as if the channel had suddenly changed,

348
00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:35.037
Mr. Hyodo dropped his head

349
00:18:35.037 --> 00:18:37.637
and started confessing what he had done.

350
00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:39.137
Everything started

351
00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:41.537
when Mr. Denkawa was finally unable to tolerate

352
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.337
Mr. Hyodo's phone that kept on ringing,

353
00:18:43.337 --> 00:18:46.837
hence busted his door, barged into his room

354
00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:48.437
and stopped the ringing.

355
00:18:48.437 --> 00:18:51.837
Back then, Mr. Denkawa happened to find

356
00:18:51.837 --> 00:18:56.537
a case filled with illegal drugs inside Mr. Hyodo's room.

357
00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:58.137
It seemed that Mr. Hyodo

358
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.237
was a carrier for an illicit smuggling organization,

359
00:19:00.237 --> 00:19:03.637
He was blackmailed by Mr. Denkawa who threatened to go to the police

360
00:19:03.637 --> 00:19:06.737
unless Mr. Hyodo gave him half of his share.

361
00:19:06.737 --> 00:19:09.437
Therefore, Mr. Hyodo made up his mind to commit homicide.

362
00:19:09.437 --> 00:19:12.337
He got Mr. Denkawa drunk an hour before leaving

363
00:19:12.337 --> 00:19:13.837
for the hot spring with the other two,

364
00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:16.337
and killed him by slashing his neck.

365
00:19:16.337 --> 00:19:20.037
After setting up the trick, he left the room and locked it.

366
00:19:20.037 --> 00:19:23.237
He used sound from the TV to make it seem as if Mr. Denkawa was alive,

367
00:19:23.237 --> 00:19:25.237
then left for the hot spring.

368
00:19:25.237 --> 00:19:27.437
The alarm clock was set to ring

369
00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:29.337
as soon as they came home from the hot spring.

370
00:19:29.337 --> 00:19:31.737
So, in order to stop the bell of the alarm clock,

371
00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:34.037
he busted down the door and went into the room.

372
00:19:34.037 --> 00:19:35.837
Amidst the commotion of discovering the corpse,

373
00:19:35.837 --> 00:19:37.637
he put the room key on the floor

374
00:19:37.637 --> 00:19:39.837
and erased traces of the trick.

375
00:19:39.837 --> 00:19:42.437
He had done exactly what I thought he did.

376
00:19:42.437 --> 00:19:45.037
Well, at least for the sake of the landlady,

377
00:19:45.037 --> 00:19:49.037
I'm glad that the fact that this man was an imposter wasn't disclosed.

378
00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:54.637
Well, there's still one person who's not okay with that.

379
00:19:57.137 --> 00:19:58.937
Hey, you!

380
00:19:58.937 --> 00:20:02.637
What with you anyway, acting as dad's imposter?

381
00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:04.837
I've already told you, haven't I?

382
00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:07.837
The landlady's granddaughter who is my girlfriend asked me to do so.

383
00:20:07.837 --> 00:20:11.537
That's a lie! Her granddaughter is married!

384
00:20:11.537 --> 00:20:15.637
Thanks to Conan, it seems as if you have solved the case,

385
00:20:15.637 --> 00:20:17.837
but you can't deceive me!

386
00:20:17.837 --> 00:20:21.037
Well, like I said...

387
00:20:21.037 --> 00:20:24.237
She was your teacher, right?

388
00:20:24.237 --> 00:20:28.237
That landlady was your teacher in elementary school, right?

389
00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:30.137
How... How did you know that?

390
00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:32.837
Since the landlady who likes to take care of other people

391
00:20:32.837 --> 00:20:36.237
wasn't helping her husband manage the apartment he owned

392
00:20:36.237 --> 00:20:38.437
until 10 years ago,

393
00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:42.237
she must have done some other jobs, right?

394
00:20:42.237 --> 00:20:46.437
That's why I thought that the way she scolds people and her loud voice

395
00:20:46.437 --> 00:20:49.437
might have had something to do with her job as a teacher before.

396
00:20:50.237 --> 00:20:51.437
I see.

397
00:20:51.437 --> 00:20:54.137
Teaching is a job in which you need to speak loudly.

398
00:20:54.137 --> 00:20:56.937
Moreover, if she used to be a teacher,

399
00:20:56.937 --> 00:20:59.637
she would've had to be able to play the piano, too.

400
00:20:59.637 --> 00:21:01.437
I think if it was some time ago,

401
00:21:01.437 --> 00:21:04.937
you could've remembered it like you do the keys of the piano.

402
00:21:04.937 --> 00:21:06.837
I guess so.

403
00:21:07.937 --> 00:21:10.137
Indeed, it seems like she used to play it.

404
00:21:10.137 --> 00:21:12.037
But the determining factor was that

405
00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:16.937
you unintentionally called the landlady "mother".

406
00:21:16.937 --> 00:21:19.937
Oh, no. Hold it there, mother.

407
00:21:19.937 --> 00:21:23.437
For elementary school children, a teacher is like a parent to them.

408
00:21:23.437 --> 00:21:27.837
And at times, children call their teacher "mother".

409
00:21:27.837 --> 00:21:30.837
You probably inadvertently called her that

410
00:21:30.837 --> 00:21:33.337
because you were reminded of the old times, right?

411
00:21:33.337 --> 00:21:35.537
Conan, how do you know something like that?

412
00:21:35.537 --> 00:21:39.937
Shinichi told me that in the mail!

413
00:21:39.937 --> 00:21:42.237
You discussed the case with Shinichi?

414
00:21:42.237 --> 00:21:43.737
It's written that this guy was

415
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:46.537
her granddaughter's classmate in their junior high school days.

416
00:21:46.537 --> 00:21:48.637
At the class reunion that was held three months ago,

417
00:21:48.637 --> 00:21:51.637
he probably heard from her granddaughter that the landlady was in a fix

418
00:21:51.637 --> 00:21:55.837
and decided to become Kogoro's imposter.

419
00:21:55.837 --> 00:21:59.337
Yes. I just couldn't let her be.

420
00:21:59.337 --> 00:22:02.137
Then, you could've just come right out

421
00:22:02.137 --> 00:22:04.637
and say that you used to be her student, couldn't you?

422
00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:08.137
She always told me not to lie,

423
00:22:08.137 --> 00:22:10.337
so I found it hard to come out and say the truth at this point.

424
00:22:10.337 --> 00:22:13.837
It's true that lying is not right.

425
00:22:13.837 --> 00:22:16.337
But if you lied out of consideration for someone,

426
00:22:16.337 --> 00:22:19.537
I'm sure that she will forgive you.

427
00:23:45.937 --> 00:23:48.037
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Several days later,

428
00:23:48.037 --> 00:23:51.237
we received a letter of gratitude with a photo from the landlady.

429
00:23:51.237 --> 00:23:52.937
The contents of the letter went as follows.

430
00:23:52.937 --> 00:23:55.737
"Your disciple that you introduced to me

431
00:23:55.737 --> 00:23:57.237
is a very nice young man

432
00:23:57.237 --> 00:23:59.937
and is helping me out in many ways."

433
00:23:59.937 --> 00:24:02.937
I have no disciples, though.

434
00:24:02.937 --> 00:24:05.737
He's lying again.

435
00:24:08.737 --> 00:24:12.637
For sure, we'll be able to catch lots of beetles and stag beetles here!

436
00:24:12.637 --> 00:24:14.837
Thanks for coming all the way here, kids.

437
00:24:14.837 --> 00:24:16.037
Hey!

438
00:24:16.037 --> 00:24:19.037
That's not for sale. Don't touch it!

439
00:24:19.037 --> 00:24:21.437
We were just looking around.

440
00:24:21.437 --> 00:24:22.737
Get out of here right this minute!

441
00:24:26.237 --> 00:24:28.837
Sir, please get a hold of yourself!

442
00:24:28.837 --> 00:24:32.737
Miyama... Stag Beetle...

443
00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:36.637
Next Conan, "Pursue the Miyama Stag Beetle".

444
00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:56.237
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:56.237 --> 00:24:58.137
"Name"

446
00:24:58.137 --> 00:25:00.037
Okay, we'll go catch beetles and stag beetles.

447
00:25:00.037 --> 00:25:02.137
-Go for it. -Okay, I'll go get the culprit then!

448
00:25:02.137 --> 00:25:03.333
Do your best.
