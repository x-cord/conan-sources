1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,370
Good morning, Dad.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,870
We already started eating because you didn't get up.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,170
They seem to have arrested the perp for the murder

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,370
the day before yesterday.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,170
The day before yesterday?

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,570
You mean the one at Tonkoro City?

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,970
This woman...

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,970
The suspect is currently being held at Tonkoro Police Station,

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,870
where she is being questioned.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,370
A canvas stained black with crime.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,070
A beautiful perp that came on TV,

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,170
Pops acts unexpectedly.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,470
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:33,828
"The Last Gift"

18
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:36,928
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

19
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,228
The important thing you wanted to talk to me about?

20
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:44,028
First, could you tell me the details of case?

21
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:49,028
It started yesterday on Saturday morning.

22
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,228
The body of Masaru Katsui,

23
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,728
who was thought to be murdered the night before

24
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:56,828
was discovered in the back of a park in Tonkoro City.

25
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,828
Because he was a serial blackmailer,

26
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:05,528
we believed that the suspect was one of his victims.

27
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:09,528
As we were questioning the suspects that we had on our list...

28
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:10,928
"Junko Hirose (25)"

29
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:14,228
Last night, Katsui came.

30
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,728
He demanded money from me again.

31
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:19,228
I just couldn't take it anymore.

32
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:22,728
Since she had a motive and she herself confessed,

33
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:24,428
we arrested her.

34
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:28,028
And, there's no mistake that this man Katsui was murdered

35
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:31,928
on Friday night around 8:00?

36
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,228
His wristwatch was stopped at that time.

37
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:39,128
We believed it broke when he was killed.

38
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:42,228
Besides, at around 7:20pm,

39
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:47,128
the security camera caught him arriving at Tonkoro City Station.

40
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:51,128
If he met the killer after that and was killed then...

41
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:54,528
If this wristwatch was stopped was stopped at 8pm

42
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,428
and that equals the time of the murder,

43
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:01,028
then she is not the killer after all.

44
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,028
What?

45
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,928
That night around 8:00,

46
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,928
she was at Beika City.

47
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,728
It's still 8pm?

48
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,828
Thank God it's Friday!

49
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:14,728
One more shop!

50
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,528
Beautiful lady?

51
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:32,928
Are you all right?

52
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,728
Miss?

53
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:46,828
That's why she couldn't have committed the crime.

54
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,528
From Beika City to the scene of the crime,

55
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:52,828
it would take close to an hour even by car.

56
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:53,928
Inspector.

57
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,328
What?

58
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,328
You want me to roll up my pants?

59
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,128
Just for our reference.

60
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,328
The left side.

61
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,428
So, it was you after all.

62
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:17,428
I happened to see you

63
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,528
on Friday night at 8:00 in Beika City.

64
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:26,228
Could you explain, Ms. Hirose?

65
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:33,728
You're right.

66
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:36,928
There's a restaurant that I know in Beika City,

67
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,728
so I was planning to go there.

68
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:42,428
But my leg hurt, so I ended up not going.

69
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:47,028
Rather, why did you lie and say you killed Katsui?

70
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,228
Well...

71
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,828
I figured that the killer would be somebody like me.

72
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,428
If that person was being blackmailed by Katsui,

73
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:58,428
I didn't mind being the killer.

74
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,928
At any rate, your alibi's been established.

75
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:07,928
But false testimony is an interference of public duties.

76
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:11,228
We'll let it go this time.

77
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,428
We're also at fault for rushing to make an arrest.

78
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,828
I'm happy for you.

79
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:18,728
Thank you very much.

80
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,128
No problem.

81
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:28,128
So, she was acquitted and safely released.

82
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:30,828
Thanks to me, her savior!

83
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:35,228
But something's strange about that lady called Ms. Junko Hirose.

84
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,228
To turn herself in for a murder she didn't even commit.

85
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,228
What?

86
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,628
She has a motive, right?

87
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:46,628
But she has a witness to her alibi.

88
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:52,128
Maybe the actual time of the crime's not correct.

89
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:58,128
Maybe the killer adjusted the time on his watch after killing him.

90
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:01,228
Ms. Junko Hirose confessed that she committed the crime.

91
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:02,428
Since she confessed to the crime,

92
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:05,728
she didn't need to change the time of committing the crime, did she?

93
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,928
Well, I guess so. But...

94
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:14,828
Wait, brat!

95
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:17,228
She's unmistakably innocent.

96
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,728
But doesn't something bother you about her?

97
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:21,428
I'll go check.

98
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:22,628
Maybe I can find out why Ms. Hirose

99
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:25,728
wanted to turn herself in as the killer.

100
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:31,328
Then, you should look into her connections with Beika City.

101
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:33,228
Because when I saw her,

102
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,128
she didn't appear to be going to a restaurant

103
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:37,628
to eat, drink, and have a good time.

104
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:41,928
I need to figure out what she really came to Beika City for.

105
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,928
I see.

106
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,328
Ms. Hirose was lying.

107
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:48,128
Just because she lied I don't think she's guilty.

108
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,328
I see.

109
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:54,728
You want to prove that Conan is wrong.

110
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:58,528
And in order to do so, I think it's best to find the real killer.

111
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,828
Over here.

112
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,028
This is where Masaru Katsui's body was found.

113
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,328
Here?

114
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:05,328
But this place is...

115
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:09,928
I'm surprised they found the body in such a well concealed place.

116
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:15,728
An anonymous woman called the police.

117
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,428
I see.

118
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:22,228
But I wonder why that woman came to a place like this?

119
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:24,328
How would I know?

120
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:27,728
The time he was killed was determined to be around 8:00 at night

121
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:31,928
because the victim's wristwatch was stopped at that time, right?

122
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,028
Yes.

123
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:38,228
We know that Katsui got to Tonkoro City Station at about 7:20pm.

124
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:41,828
That matches the time of death determined by the autopsy.

125
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:46,128
Which was between 7pm and 9pm.

126
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,328
Between 7pm and 9pm?

127
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:54,328
If she hurried back to Tonkoro City

128
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:57,028
after being seen at Beika City at 8pm,

129
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:58,628
she would've arrived around 9pm.

130
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:02,528
Ms. Hirose could've barely committed the crime, too.

131
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:06,528
Then, made it seem as though he'd been killed at 8pm.

132
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:10,328
Then, she would've created an alibi for that time beforehand, right?

133
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:14,528
Somebody other than who just coincidentally happened to see her!

134
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:15,528
But...

135
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:19,228
And? Do you have any evidence that could lead us to the real killer?

136
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,228
Nothing whatsoever.

137
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,028
Katsui bought two packs of cigarettes at the station,

138
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:29,428
but one was left untouched in his pocket.

139
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,828
So he was a heavy smoker.

140
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,628
Either way, there's no clue.

141
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,528
But if there's even a slight chance

142
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:39,128
that she could've committed the crime...

143
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,328
Enough, brat!

144
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:46,628
Her man lives in Beika City?

145
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,028
It's her ex-boyfriend to be exact.

146
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,028
His name is Mr. Atsuro Matsubayashi.

147
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,228
And it seems he recently got engaged

148
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,628
to the daughter of an executive where he works.

149
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:02,128
So, Ms. Junko Hirose was dumped.

150
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:06,128
But she has no other connections with Beika City,

151
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:11,328
so I think she was actually visiting him the other night.

152
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,328
So, she did have somebody else

153
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:18,028
who could verify her alibi besides you, Pops.

154
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:20,028
At 8pm.

155
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,728
You're saying that's him?

156
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,728
What're you talking about?

157
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,428
Fabricating an alibi.

158
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:29,928
If you assumed she used her ex-boyfriend...

159
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,128
Then, wouldn't she have naturally

160
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:36,428
told the police about Mr. Matsubayashi when they suspected her?

161
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,328
Right.

162
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:39,928
True, but...

163
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,628
I got it.

164
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:46,628
I've figured out why Ms. Hirose wanted to turn herself in.

165
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:54,028
That night, Ms. Hirose visited Mr. Matsubayashi.

166
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:59,028
In order to get rid of old mementos still left there.

167
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,128
But she couldn't tell the police about it.

168
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,428
She couldn't tell the police?

169
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:06,928
Right. She couldn't tell them.

170
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,128
Why not?

171
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:11,428
If she did, the police would try persistently

172
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:14,728
to confirm story with Mr. Matsubayashi.

173
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:18,528
If they do, then Mr. Matsubayashi's fiance may find out

174
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:23,528
that he let his ex-girlfriend into his room, right?

175
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:27,428
Then his fiance might think that he was up to something and doubt him!

176
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:31,228
If worse comes to worse, she may call off the engagement.

177
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:35,628
More so, she's the daughter of an executive at his company.

178
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,228
Mr. Matsubayashi may end up not being able to stay at his company, too.

179
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:41,528
Ms. Hirose probably hid the truth

180
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:44,328
because she didn't want him to go through something like this.

181
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,728
Even if it meant being convicted of a crime she didn't commit,

182
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:50,728
because she wanted to protect Mr. Matsubayashi's happiness!

183
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,428
He dumped her for another woman, you know?

184
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:55,328
But she still wanted to do it.

185
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:59,628
Because Ms. Hirose still loves Mr. Matsubayashi.

186
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:02,728
She turned herself in as the killer

187
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:07,128
as her last gift to Mr. Matsubayashi.

188
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:09,728
But, Ran...

189
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,528
Interesting.

190
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:18,028
Your theory that she tried to use her ex to fabricate her alibi.

191
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,728
And Ran's theory that she still loves him.

192
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:24,928
If we meet this Matsubayashi guy,

193
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:29,528
we'll find out right away which of you is correct.

194
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,628
"Atsuro Matsubayashi (28)" -What?

195
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,028
You're asking me if Junko came here?

196
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,128
Yes, two nights ago.

197
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,728
Of course not.

198
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:38,528
Because we broke up.

199
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,228
But, Mr. Matsubayashi...

200
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,328
What a nuisance!

201
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,528
Don't ever come here again!

202
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:54,328
Based on his reaction, it's obvious that Ms. Hirose went to visit him.

203
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:56,428
But being the kind of man he is,

204
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:59,228
both your theories aren't supported.

205
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,428
You're right.

206
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,328
It's hard to believe that he's the kind of guy you'd want to protect

207
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,928
to the point of being convicted for something you didn't do.

208
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:09,728
And I doubt that he would've agreed to verify Ms. Hirose's alibi

209
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,928
even if she asked him to.

210
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:16,328
In other words, she couldn't have used him to fabricate her alibi.

211
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,328
I guess I was wrong about suspecting Ms. Hirose.

212
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:23,128
So, you finally admit it!

213
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:32,928
Either way, he's a selfish gold digger.

214
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:39,528
Even so, Ms. Hirose still really loved and trusted him.

215
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:43,528
Wait a sec.

216
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,328
Maybe this case...

217
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,828
Pops.

218
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,528
When you went to verify her alibi for her,

219
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:53,928
how did Ms. Hirose react?

220
00:13:55,428 --> 00:14:00,028
She was surprised and flustered.

221
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:01,628
She pondered.

222
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,528
And then, she looked happy.

223
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:04,928
So what?

224
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,328
I'm just confirming.

225
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:12,328
If so, there should be a trace of it.

226
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,595
Excuse me.

227
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,295
Is Ms. Hirose moving out?

228
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:46,695
Yes. Because of the awful things she went through

229
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,895
like being suspected by the police.

230
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,895
Really?

231
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:53,195
That's rubbish, right?

232
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:54,995
I'll go throw it away for you.

233
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,995
Thanks, you're so thoughtful.

234
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,895
Since it was Friday night,

235
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,695
it probably hasn't been collected yet and should be here.

236
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:05,695
I found it.

237
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:12,395
What would you possibly want with me now?

238
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:16,095
Why did I have to be called out to a place like this?

239
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:18,795
Well, we don't have the slightest idea either.

240
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,795
Sorry to keep you waiting.

241
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:25,095
Why did you gather all of us here, Mr. Mouri?

242
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:26,295
What?

243
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,095
I was told to come here by you, Inspector.

244
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,795
Mr. Mouri, we examined this thing Conan brought us.

245
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:34,995
You were exactly right.

246
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:37,395
But what does this mean?

247
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,895
What's that?

248
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,495
I didn't...

249
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:50,395
You couldn't take it anymore, could you, Ms. Junko Hirose?

250
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,395
Yes?

251
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,995
I don't know what weak point he knew about you,

252
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,795
but Masaru Katsui kept blackmailing you.

253
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,495
And your boyfriend, Mr. Matsubayashi

254
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:03,895
went after an executive's daughter to marry her for money.

255
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,095
That's none of your business, is it?

256
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:11,095
And when Masaru Katsui demanded money from you again,

257
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,195
you wanted to get rid of this obnoxious blackmailer

258
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:16,795
from the face of this earth.

259
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:22,295
It's impossible to run after committing murder.

260
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,895
But you made up your mind.

261
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:29,195
If you could use the murder for another purpose,

262
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:31,495
you figured you didn't mind getting caught.

263
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,695
Then you carried it out.

264
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,595
But, Mr. Mouri...

265
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,295
You're the one who said she was innocent.

266
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:41,395
I thought you verified my alibi for me.

267
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:43,695
Just after 7:00 at night on the day of the incident,

268
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:47,895
you visited Mr. Matsubayashi who lives in Beika City.

269
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:50,295
What do you want?

270
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,195
You're getting married, aren't you?

271
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:55,895
Then, you've got to erase all traces of me.

272
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,295
Hey, wait.

273
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:59,395
You can't do that!

274
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:03,195
You entered Mr. Matsubayashi's room using some appropriated excuse.

275
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:06,895
Just about that time Masaru Katsui comes to Tonkoro City

276
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,495
because you told him to come.

277
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,395
And after leaving Mr. Matsubayashi's room at 8pm,

278
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,995
you rushed back to Tonkoro City.

279
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:19,695
And, I just happened to witness you then.

280
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:24,595
Then you led Masaru Katsui who was waiting for you to the crime scene

281
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:27,595
and killed him around 9pm.

282
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:32,195
You turned the hands of the wristwatch back to 8pm and broke it.

283
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:33,695
And the following morning,

284
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,795
you made an anonymous call to the police

285
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,495
and made them find Katsui's body.

286
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:41,895
You confessed your crime to the police detective that was asking around.

287
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,595
And everything was completed.

288
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,795
Last night, Katsui came.

289
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:50,395
He demanded money from me again.

290
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,095
I just couldn't take it anymore.

291
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:56,095
If the suspect is denying to have committed the crime,

292
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:59,795
there's a possibility that the wristwatch may have been rigged.

293
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,095
However, since you confessed to committing the crime,

294
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:03,995
nobody would doubt that.

295
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,295
You're right.

296
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:09,295
But if she meant to confess to the crime,

297
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:12,695
why did she fabricate such an alibi?

298
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:13,895
Mr. Matsubayashi.

299
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,595
You must've known that Ms. Hirose was arrested for murder

300
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,795
by seeing the news on TV, correct?

301
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:27,095
And that the time of the crime was 8pm on Friday night.

302
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,295
In other words,

303
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:33,095
even though you knew Ms. Hirose couldn't have done it,

304
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,295
you didn't come up front.

305
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,095
No. I was just about to...

306
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:39,195
That's a lie!

307
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,795
You're not the type to throw the good fortune

308
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:47,795
that you grasped down the drain, no matter what!

309
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:52,095
The other purpose for the killing of Katsui

310
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:53,595
was to make Mr. Matsubayashi feel guilty

311
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:59,095
for ignoring to save an innocent person from being accused.

312
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,195
This would've been Ms. Hirose's first crime

313
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,095
and if you think of her motive,

314
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,795
she would've been released in more or less a short period.

315
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,195
And after that...

316
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:14,495
How dare you ignore me, despite my being innocent?

317
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:18,295
How dare you watch and do nothing?

318
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,695
Dear, who is she?

319
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,095
What does she mean saying that you watched and did nothing?

320
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:35,195
You rigged the watch to make it look like the crime to place at 8pm,

321
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:38,795
so that Mr. Matsubayashi who selfishly dumped you, would feel guilty.

322
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:41,695
It was your last gift to him.

323
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,495
A gift filled with hatred.

324
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:52,795
You miscalculated when another person witnessed you.

325
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,395
That's why you were surprised.

326
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,795
And you were flustered and pondered.

327
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:02,295
You were considering how to handle my testimony.

328
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:05,495
Then, you happily latched onto it.

329
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,595
You weren't able to get rid of your grudge for Mr. Matsubayashi,

330
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:15,095
but you would be free of having committed murder.

331
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,395
They're all assumptions.

332
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:21,795
I haven't met Katsui for many years now.

333
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,395
That night at 7:20,

334
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,595
Katsui who arrives at Tonkoro City.

335
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:30,995
Just where was he for an hour and a half till 9pm when he was murdered?

336
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,895
Since you wanted to make everyone think that he was killed at 8pm,

337
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:40,895
you couldn't afford to have anyone witness Katsui.

338
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:44,395
The safest hiding place would be

339
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:45,795
your room.

340
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,395
She sure is late.

341
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:55,295
Officer Takagi, please explain.

342
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,895
In this convenience store shopping bag there are 10 cigarette butts

343
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:02,395
and a carton of 10 cigarettes that haven't been smoked yet.

344
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,095
Katsui's fingerprints were found on all the items.

345
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:09,895
And from this bag, Ms. Junko Hirose's fingerprints were also found.

346
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:18,495
In other words, Katsui was waiting for you in your room.

347
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:27,495
So he could be killed by me.

348
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,195
And I meant to use his murder

349
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:37,095
to take revenge for the betrayal of the man I loved and trusted.

350
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,995
You're absolutely correct.

351
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,695
Then Ms. Junko Hirose,

352
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:44,495
may I ask you to come with me to the station once again?

353
00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:46,095
What a stupid lady.

354
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:49,195
I wonder if you can really laugh at her, Mr. Matsubayashi?

355
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:54,295
When the background of Ms. Hirose's crime is publicized in detail,

356
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:58,295
what will your fiance or her father think of you?

357
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:28,095
Suspect Junko Hirose who was arrested once again,

358
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:30,495
has obediently confessed to committing the crime.

359
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:34,995
You were right, Conan, after all.

360
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:36,895
It's just a coincidence.

361
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,095
That's right.

362
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:40,495
What went through his head just happened to be right.

363
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,495
It's like night and day from my deduction,

364
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,795
totally different like chalk and cheese!

365
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:46,095
Totally different.

366
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,395
Totally different.

367
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,995
-Totally different. -Give me a break, old man.

368
00:23:54,295 --> 00:24:01,195
"Next Episode"

369
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,695
Are you hurt?

370
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:07,795
Tsutsumi?

371
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:10,695
Where did they find that suicide note?

372
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:16,795
It seems the paramedics found it in Mr. Tsutsumi's jacket pocket.

373
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:24,295
Next Conan, "Bus Stop in the Rain"

374
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,738
Next Conan's Hint:

375
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:29,338
"Umbrella"

376
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:32,438
I got wet in the rain and I can't even take a bath?

377
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,138
-That's not it. -That's not it.
