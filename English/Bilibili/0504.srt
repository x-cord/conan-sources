1
00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:05.858
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:07.258
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:09.758
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:13.658
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:16.858
Just a planned, Kir is returned to the Organization,

6
00:00:16.858 --> 00:00:20.858
but he is suspected by Gin and ordered to kill Akai.

7
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.258
The murder that occurred in New Beika Hotel was...

8
00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:29.658
Are you sure we can get the culprit that way?

9
00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:32.758
Yep, because it's a spell that Shinichi told me about,

10
00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:35.658
so I'm sure it'll work.

11
00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:37.458
When all four get here,

12
00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:38.758
I start by saying...

13
00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:44.858
Shiraunplee!

14
00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.258
Thanks to the magic spell, the case was solved smoothly.

15
00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.558
In the meantime,

16
00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:03.458
FBI agent Akai was being summoned by Kir of the Black Organization,

17
00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:06.858
also known as CIA informant Rena Mizunashi,

18
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:10.558
and heading towards the specified meeting place, Raiha Pass.

19
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.558
Sizzling hot suspense.

20
00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:29.158
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

21
00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:30.958
The final gun shot echoes through the ridge.

22
00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.158
What will become of FBI agent, Shuichi Akai?

23
00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:34.658
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:36.258
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.358
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.040
"Red and Black Crash: Killed on Duty"

27
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.040
CIA?

28
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.440
Just what're you talking about?

29
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.940
What does that have to do with you, Sis?

30
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.340
Hey, wait! I don't get it!

31
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.040
Huh? Hey...

32
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.340
I'm not finished talking to you yet.

33
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.440
Ei-chan.

34
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.740
Father.

35
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.940
Don't give up, Hidemi.

36
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.540
If you keep on waiting,

37
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.240
friends will surely appear.

38
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.840
Promise you'll complete my mission for me.

39
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.040
What...

40
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.840
What's up?

41
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.140
Coming from the opposite direction.

42
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.940
I got a head start

43
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.340
and checked up on a lot of things.

44
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.940
Really?

45
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.240
And...

46
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.740
Were you able to get what you wanted?

47
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.740
The confirmation that I came here alone.

48
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.440
Yeah.

49
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.240
I guess you did.

50
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.740
And what information are you giving me

51
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.140
in exchange for helping you whip off?

52
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.840
Yes. The thing I can give you is...

53
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.140
Porsche 356A.

54
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.140
So, that's the story.

55
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.540
What's up, Kir?

56
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.840
Finish him off quick.

57
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.340
But...

58
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.740
I shot him through his lungs,

59
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.040
so he'll die if left as is in about 30 minutes.

60
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.540
His head...

61
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.940
Shoot the bullet through his head.

62
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.940
And see that he completely stops breathing.

63
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.240
Roger.

64
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.340
I didn't think I was going to end here.

65
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.040
I'm surprised too

66
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.040
that everything worked out so smoothly.

67
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.540
Police.

68
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.640
It seems that there was an accident nearby.

69
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.440
Kir, get rid of him and split.

70
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.840
Roger.

71
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.340
I had no choice...

72
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.240
What the...

73
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.140
Hurry, contact the station!

74
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.240
Yes, sir!

75
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.940
Why? Why aren't you answering

76
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.940
when the cellphone that I borrowed from Conan is finally connecting?

77
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.940
Huh?

78
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.440
Shu's not answering the phone.

79
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.840
Maybe he's taking a cat nap.

80
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.440
Mr. Akai didn't seem to have much sleep

81
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.440
since the start of this case.

82
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.040
I tell you...

83
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.440
What shall we do, Conan?

84
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.040
You said before that when we, the FBI withdraw from the hospital,

85
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.640
you wanted to come, right?

86
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.340
Yeah.

87
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.540
Would you like to come with us now?

88
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.640
I was thinking of doing so,

89
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.440
but I guess it would be a bother

90
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.640
to have a kid running around too.

91
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.740
Besides, today is Friday, the 13th.

92
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.140
I think it would be better for me

93
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.040
to head on home and hit the sack.

94
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.440
See you later, Jodie.

95
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.440
Friday the 13th?

96
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.940
Huh?

97
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.240
Be careful.

98
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.640
I have this bad feeling today.

99
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.240
Oh, it's because today is Friday the 13th, right?

100
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.640
I don't believe in such things.

101
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.340
I see.

102
00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:26.993
Huh?

103
00:11:26.993 --> 00:11:31.093
Shu... Shu was summoned by Rena Mizunashi and went to see her?

104
00:11:31.093 --> 00:11:32.093
Yeah.

105
00:11:32.093 --> 00:11:37.493
He got a call from her right after you left.

106
00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:39.593
He said he'd be seeing her, just the two of them.

107
00:11:39.593 --> 00:11:41.093
Just the two of them...

108
00:11:41.093 --> 00:11:43.193
I'm sure it's a trap!

109
00:11:43.193 --> 00:11:45.793
Why didn't you stop him?

110
00:11:45.793 --> 00:11:48.193
Well, I did, actually.

111
00:11:48.193 --> 00:11:49.493
He insisted that he had to go,

112
00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:52.593
because if he didn't, her life would be in danger.

113
00:11:52.593 --> 00:11:54.493
But, Akai can handle himself well,

114
00:11:54.493 --> 00:11:56.893
so, I don't think there's need for worry.

115
00:11:56.893 --> 00:11:59.193
That...

116
00:11:59.193 --> 00:12:03.093
They were going to meet in Raiha Pass, right?

117
00:12:03.093 --> 00:12:04.593
Yeah.

118
00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:07.993
I saw on the TV news just now

119
00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:10.793
that a car was up in flames at Raiha Pass

120
00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:13.493
and a burnt body seems to have been found inside.

121
00:12:13.493 --> 00:12:15.093
-Huh? -What?

122
00:12:16.293 --> 00:12:18.593
The car that went up in flames was a black Chevy,

123
00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:22.093
and found inside was a man in his 20's or 30's.

124
00:12:22.093 --> 00:12:24.793
The car was found by a police officer

125
00:12:24.793 --> 00:12:27.593
who was coincidentally on his way to another scene of an accident.

126
00:12:27.593 --> 00:12:29.693
According to an eye-witness report by that officer,

127
00:12:29.693 --> 00:12:32.593
he says that the car suddenly exploded right in front of his eyes.

128
00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:35.993
And from the fact that the body seems to have been shot,

129
00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:39.293
the police is investigating this case as homicide.

130
00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:41.993
They hope to identify the body by what little is left of the license plate

131
00:12:41.993 --> 00:12:42.993
and the right hand of the body...

132
00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:45.093
No! That isn't Shu!

133
00:12:45.093 --> 00:12:48.093
He set someone from the Organization up in his place!

134
00:12:48.093 --> 00:12:49.893
I'm sure that he would do so!

135
00:12:49.893 --> 00:12:51.093
I agree!

136
00:12:51.093 --> 00:12:53.493
"Car fire, Mysterious gunshot" -I'm sure we can confirm things easily

137
00:12:53.493 --> 00:12:55.493
if we go to the police department!

138
00:12:55.493 --> 00:13:00.593
But, can we make confirmation when the body is burnt?

139
00:13:00.593 --> 00:13:02.593
If the right hand of the body is still there,

140
00:13:02.593 --> 00:13:05.493
we could confirm by matching it to Akai's fingerprints.

141
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.393
Then, we could match it to Akai's fingerprints

142
00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:09.793
that are registered at the FBI.

143
00:13:09.793 --> 00:13:11.793
We'd like to match fingerprints,

144
00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:13.293
so please lend us his right hand

145
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:17.493
because he maybe one of our agents.

146
00:13:17.493 --> 00:13:19.093
Is that what we're going to say?

147
00:13:20.693 --> 00:13:23.293
The same goes for Akai's Chevy.

148
00:13:23.293 --> 00:13:26.393
I'm sure that his fingerprints would be somewhere on it,

149
00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.493
but now that it's gone up in flames,

150
00:13:27.493 --> 00:13:29.693
it'll be retrieved by the police.

151
00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:31.693
We couldn't possibly tell them to give it to us,

152
00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:33.693
without explaining the reasons.

153
00:13:35.693 --> 00:13:39.493
If we could only find a way to match his fingerprints

154
00:13:39.493 --> 00:13:43.693
with that of the dead body without being suspected.

155
00:13:43.693 --> 00:13:46.993
If we use the cell phone with his fingerprints on it,

156
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.093
I'm sure we can successfully match the fingerprints.

157
00:13:50.093 --> 00:13:52.493
But, his cell phone is...

158
00:13:55.093 --> 00:13:59.393
This is a cell phone that I borrowed from Conan, but...

159
00:13:59.393 --> 00:14:02.493
I'll go out side then and call him on the phone.

160
00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:04.893
I think he'll come right away.

161
00:14:06.093 --> 00:14:08.093
Even for you,

162
00:14:08.093 --> 00:14:10.993
that's something that cannot be done.

163
00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:13.493
This is work for us, the FBI.

164
00:14:15.793 --> 00:14:18.093
We can't involved an ordinary citizen

165
00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:19.593
more than we already have.

166
00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:21.693
But...

167
00:14:23.393 --> 00:14:25.593
Leave the rest up to us.

168
00:14:27.093 --> 00:14:29.393
Then, you have Akai's fingerprints?

169
00:14:29.393 --> 00:14:30.493
Yes.

170
00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:32.593
I'll take this and go to the police.

171
00:14:33.993 --> 00:14:36.893
Wait, let me give you a lift.

172
00:14:36.893 --> 00:14:38.193
I hate to repeat myself,

173
00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:39.493
but make sure you don't tell anyone

174
00:14:39.493 --> 00:14:43.093
that the body is one of the members of the FBI.

175
00:14:43.093 --> 00:14:45.793
No, I won't tell

176
00:14:45.793 --> 00:14:47.393
and I'll make sure no one suspects me either.

177
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:58.593
Huh? He could be the man who picked up your cell phone?

178
00:14:58.593 --> 00:15:01.793
You mean the man who was just found burnt to death?

179
00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:07.493
Yes, I was coincidentally driving through Raiha Pass today too.

180
00:15:07.493 --> 00:15:10.293
We had lunch at a drive-in nearby.

181
00:15:10.293 --> 00:15:13.093
But, I must've for some reason dropped it then.

182
00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:16.393
And this man seems to have picked my cell phone up for me.

183
00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:18.193
That man was also riding a Chevy,

184
00:15:18.193 --> 00:15:20.893
so I thought that maybe if it were him.

185
00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:23.593
I could be of help to the investigation

186
00:15:23.593 --> 00:15:26.093
since I remember what he was wearing as well as his face.

187
00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:27.393
I see.

188
00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:29.993
Then please let me have it.

189
00:15:31.993 --> 00:15:36.493
That cell phone is what I borrowed from Conan.

190
00:15:36.493 --> 00:15:39.793
So, I think that my fingerprints as well as Conan's are on it too.

191
00:15:39.793 --> 00:15:41.193
I understand.

192
00:15:41.193 --> 00:15:42.893
I'll check it right away,

193
00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:44.793
so please wait right here.

194
00:15:54.293 --> 00:15:55.793
We've got the results.

195
00:15:57.393 --> 00:15:59.093
And...

196
00:15:59.093 --> 00:16:03.093
was I mistaken after all?

197
00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:10.193
Thank you for going out of your way to come.

198
00:16:10.193 --> 00:16:12.693
No problem.

199
00:16:12.693 --> 00:16:15.693
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

200
00:16:15.693 --> 00:16:18.893
Not being able to remember clearly the characteristics of that man.

201
00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:23.593
Oh, but that body has many unexplainable points to it.

202
00:16:23.593 --> 00:16:25.193
So, please let us know

203
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.493
if you recall anything else.

204
00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:27.993
Yes, of course.

205
00:16:29.393 --> 00:16:33.393
Okay, then, thank you so much for everything today.

206
00:16:37.893 --> 00:16:39.593
As a result of the investigation,

207
00:16:39.593 --> 00:16:40.893
just as you had mentioned,

208
00:16:40.893 --> 00:16:44.493
your fingerprints together with Conan were also found

209
00:16:44.493 --> 00:16:46.893
with the fingerprints of the man

210
00:16:46.893 --> 00:16:49.493
who just burned to death a while ago.

211
00:16:52.793 --> 00:16:54.893
From the looks of it,

212
00:16:54.893 --> 00:16:58.193
I guess the body was Akai after all.

213
00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:05.693
But, we couldn't possibly blame Rena Mizunashi either.

214
00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:08.993
She would've been killed if she didn't kill him

215
00:17:08.993 --> 00:17:12.893
and it seems she told Akai that...

216
00:17:12.893 --> 00:17:14.693
No matter what happens,

217
00:17:14.693 --> 00:17:17.693
the mission of the CIA is top priority to not be offended,

218
00:17:17.693 --> 00:17:21.693
even if it turns out to be inconvenient for the FBI.

219
00:17:22.693 --> 00:17:24.293
So...

220
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:29.493
Now we've been able to drive a wedge into the Organization.

221
00:17:29.493 --> 00:17:32.493
A steel wedge that can never be removed.

222
00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:36.893
Maybe Akai...

223
00:17:36.893 --> 00:17:40.893
deliberately became a scapegoat to drive this wedge in.

224
00:17:42.493 --> 00:17:47.293
But, the price was much too high to pay.

225
00:17:47.293 --> 00:17:51.293
Shu...

226
00:17:58.693 --> 00:18:00.193
What?

227
00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:04.593
I got the blind spot of the rifle.

228
00:18:07.293 --> 00:18:08.893
When did you...

229
00:18:08.893 --> 00:18:13.593
Throw down your gun...

230
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.593
If you don't, I'm going to blow your head off.

231
00:18:20.693 --> 00:18:22.293
The sound of a pump?

232
00:18:22.293 --> 00:18:23.893
A shot gun?

233
00:18:23.893 --> 00:18:26.093
Okay, Calvados,

234
00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:27.693
we'll take her from both sides.

235
00:18:30.393 --> 00:18:31.993
Oh no...

236
00:18:31.993 --> 00:18:33.193
They're coming from behind.

237
00:18:48.993 --> 00:18:50.693
Go on, Calvados.

238
00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:53.493
Use that Remington of yours

239
00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:57.193
to blow over that little kitty of the FBI.

240
00:18:57.193 --> 00:18:59.993
Oh, so that guy's name is...

241
00:18:59.993 --> 00:19:02.793
Calvados.

242
00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:09.793
He had a rifle, a shotgun and three pistols on him.

243
00:19:11.293 --> 00:19:15.093
So I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

244
00:19:15.093 --> 00:19:17.093
Shuichi Akai?

245
00:19:17.093 --> 00:19:18.293
Shu.

246
00:19:27.593 --> 00:19:30.893
Don't kill her, Shu!

247
00:19:41.293 --> 00:19:43.093
Blowing up the gas tank

248
00:19:43.093 --> 00:19:46.193
using the side mirror from that position.

249
00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:47.493
Quite a marksman.

250
00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:49.593
Shu.

251
00:19:49.593 --> 00:19:51.193
This is no time to be amazed!

252
00:19:51.193 --> 00:19:55.193
They took the hostage and fled!

253
00:19:55.193 --> 00:19:57.893
You should never leave your keys in the car.

254
00:20:00.093 --> 00:20:02.793
Okay, I'll leave the rest to you.

255
00:20:04.593 --> 00:20:07.093
I can't afford to come face to face

256
00:20:07.093 --> 00:20:10.193
with that brown-haired girl yet, you see.

257
00:20:18.693 --> 00:20:20.293
Shu.

258
00:20:20.293 --> 00:20:24.293
You haven't finished doing all you have to do yet, have you?

259
00:20:30.393 --> 00:20:34.393
Shu...

260
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.493
We don't need two bullets.

261
00:21:21.493 --> 00:21:23.593
One bullet is enough

262
00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:26.993
to get rid of Silver Bread.

263
00:22:57.793 --> 00:23:01.393
Here you go.

264
00:23:01.393 --> 00:23:04.093
The cell phone that I borrowed from you.

265
00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:06.593
Huh? You don't need it already?

266
00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:08.093
No, thank you.

267
00:23:08.093 --> 00:23:09.493
That cell phone in question...

268
00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:12.393
We're going to have to keep it here for a while,

269
00:23:12.393 --> 00:23:14.393
so could you hand this cell phone

270
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:17.593
that's the same type as his for the time being?

271
00:23:17.593 --> 00:23:19.293
If you have the SIM card over there,

272
00:23:19.293 --> 00:23:22.593
he should have no problem using it.

273
00:23:22.593 --> 00:23:25.893
Okay, thank you, Conan.

274
00:23:33.293 --> 00:23:35.493
The serial number is different.

275
00:23:35.493 --> 00:23:37.393
Oh, Jodie.

276
00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:40.693
What?

277
00:23:40.693 --> 00:23:43.193
Oh, that...

278
00:23:43.193 --> 00:23:44.893
Hang in there.

279
00:23:44.893 --> 00:23:46.393
Yes, I will.

280
00:23:51.593 --> 00:23:52.893
Hey, Conan!

281
00:23:52.893 --> 00:23:54.293
Just what're you doing?

282
00:23:54.293 --> 00:23:56.093
You're going to be tardy for school!

283
00:24:02.393 --> 00:24:04.593
Okay!

284
00:24:11.893 --> 00:24:14.293
"Next Episode"

285
00:24:16.793 --> 00:24:18.393
What?

286
00:24:18.393 --> 00:24:20.393
Did you hear a strange sound just now?

287
00:24:22.893 --> 00:24:23.993
The sounds I heard were...

288
00:24:23.993 --> 00:24:26.993
A crash like something bumping into something,

289
00:24:26.993 --> 00:24:29.393
a thud like something falling

290
00:24:29.393 --> 00:24:32.293
and a rattle like something was being rolled along the ground.

291
00:24:36.493 --> 00:24:37.993
Next Conan,

292
00:24:37.993 --> 00:24:41.993
"Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony, Part One"

293
00:24:57.793 --> 00:24:59.693
Next Conan's Hint:

294
00:24:59.693 --> 00:25:02.093
Hair.

295
00:25:02.093 --> 00:25:04.093
-Ready go. -Next, an incident occurs at a beauty salon.

296
00:25:04.093 --> 00:25:05.993
-Now, cut! -Great cut.

297
00:25:05.993 --> 00:25:07.590
Right?
