1
00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:03.424
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:05.024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:06.324
Ran is with me in New York,

4
00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:08.224
the case starts with a movie actress.

5
00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:09.824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:11.511
Ran?

9
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.011
Rain.

10
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.511
Do I need a reason?

11
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:30.611
Does God really exist?

12
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:32.511
Are you Japanese?

13
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:36.711
No angel ever smiled down on me.

14
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.211
Get lost!

15
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.511
Not even once.

16
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:42.611
Sharon.

17
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:47.211
Now I remember. It's that time...

18
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:48.911
when I met her.

19
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.611
I went with Shinichi.

20
00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:53.411
I...

21
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.711
Ran!

22
00:03:04.011 --> 00:03:09.211
"Shinichi In New York (Part 1)"

23
00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:11.311
Ran.

24
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:12.311
Ran!

25
00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:15.611
Ran! Hey, Ran!

26
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.511
What's the matter? Hey!

27
00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:19.211
Ran.

28
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.911
What's wrong?

29
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.111
Ran...

30
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:26.211
What's wrong, kid?

31
00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:28.511
It's Ran. She...

32
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:33.611
This is terrible. She's burning up.

33
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:35.011
Hey, call for an ambulance.

34
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:36.911
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.511
No, wait!

36
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:41.811
Call the hospital and tell them we're bringing a patient in.

37
00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:45.111
But inspector, which hospital do I call?

38
00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:47.611
The one on the other side of the Bay Bridge!

39
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:49.111
They have an emergency ward!

40
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:50.311
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:56.911
Oh, my. What happened to me?

42
00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:59.111
I know a doctor at that hospital.

43
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:01.111
They'll give us a bed right away

44
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:03.611
and it won't take us 10 minutes to get there with in the police unit.

45
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:04.611
I got you.

46
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.111
Start the engine. We'll be there right away.

47
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.111
Yes, sir!

48
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:08.511
What happened?

49
00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:10.711
Ran! Ran!

50
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:12.711
Hang on, Ran.

51
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.111
Ran.

52
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:18.111
-Ran... -Who's there?

53
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:23.811
Shinichi? Is that you, Shinichi?

54
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:25.611
How embarrassing.

55
00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.911
He saved me again...

56
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:31.711
just like the last time...

57
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.811
whenever I'm feeling depressed.

58
00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:38.411
He seems to be able to see right through me.

59
00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:44.611
I hate to admit it but it makes me happy.

60
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:48.311
Shinichi.

61
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.011
Shinichi.

62
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.111
What?

63
00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:16.411
Wait a second.

64
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:17.711
Isn't that...

65
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.411
The Statue of Liberty.

66
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.511
In Japan, we call it "Jiyu no Megumi".

67
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:26.611
I've heard that New Yorkers call her Miss Liberty, though.

68
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.311
For goodness sake. Why didn't you wake me up?

69
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:34.011
I was really looking forward to seeing this night view

70
00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:36.411
of the city from the Brooklyn Bridge!

71
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:40.011
And look, we're almost at the end of the bridge already!

72
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:41.311
Listen you.

73
00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:43.411
If you'd have slept in the plane like everybody else,

74
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:45.711
you wouldn't have fallen asleep like you did.

75
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:49.011
How could I sleep after that last case?

76
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:50.111
I'm not like some people

77
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.011
who can fall fast asleep after being satisfied they solved a case.

78
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.411
I wouldn't say I was completely satisfied.

79
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.711
When it comes to the reasoning and analysis of crime,

80
00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:03.911
I don't think we can learn enough, it would take a lifetime

81
00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:06.611
and I still wouldn't know everything there is to it, Watson.

82
00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:08.011
What?

83
00:06:08.011 --> 00:06:11.011
Just listen to you two,

84
00:06:11.011 --> 00:06:16.111
this romantic view of the city would charm every couple in the world,

85
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:17.611
are you two having a lover's spat?

86
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.111
How I envy you!

87
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.911
Mom, this is all your fault, you know.

88
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:26.111
We weren't supposed to arrive in New York until tomorrow

89
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:27.511
but the minute we arrived in Los Angeles,

90
00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:29.611
you made us get on the lane to New York.

91
00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.311
I didn't have a choice. I wanted to see this musical

92
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:35.411
but I didn't think I could get the tickets, but I did.

93
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:37.411
What? Did you say musical?

94
00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:40.411
Yes. See, that one.

95
00:06:40.411 --> 00:06:43.111
"The Golden Apple"

96
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.711
"Golden Apple", I hear it's very popular now.

97
00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:51.711
That's right. Broadway's Phantom Theater, 8 pm.

98
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:53.711
I'm so excited!

99
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:01.011
There sure seem to be a lot of police cars

100
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:02.511
on the road tonight, don't you think?

101
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.811
I guess they're after that slasher.

102
00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:08.911
Slasher?

103
00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:12.111
I heard the slasher's Japanese

104
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:14.911
and he only goes after young women.

105
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:21.911
You don't have to worry. He only appears after midnight,

106
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:26.111
you won't run into him as long as we get back to the hotel by then.

107
00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:28.511
Besides, it isn't even 6 pm yet.

108
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:31.111
Don't you mean 7 pm?

109
00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:33.111
We're on daylight savings time now.

110
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:35.311
What?

111
00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:39.811
Oh, no! It slipped my mind completely!

112
00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:42.111
Starting the first Sunday in April,

113
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.211
we set our clocks 1 hour ahead, don't we?

114
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.611
Oh, no!

115
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:47.511
Why're you so upset?

116
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:51.011
It only takes about 40 minutes to get from here to Broadway.

117
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:54.411
And it's still before 7 pm, we'll get there in plenty of time.

118
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:55.911
You don't understand,

119
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:59.311
I promised to meet the person who got the tickets for me.

120
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.111
I'm supposed to get to see the dressing rooms

121
00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:03.711
if I get there 1 hour before the curtain goes up.

122
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.511
I guess you're just going to have to forget about it.

123
00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:08.111
This so-called "English Lady" you bought

124
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:10.211
because you fell in love with it

125
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:13.111
will never get you there on time, mom.

126
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:18.911
Now you've done it, Shinichi.

127
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:23.911
Ran, grit your teeth and hang on tight.

128
00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:26.111
Okay, sure.

129
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:28.811
The people at the Jaguar company put everything

130
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:31.411
into this E type when they built it.

131
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:36.411
Never underestimate me.

132
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.711
Are you sure about this?

133
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.211
This car was in the shop for repairs last month.

134
00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:11.111
You just got it back the other day.

135
00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:15.511
Don't worry, the mechanic was a pro, the car works like a dream.

136
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:20.511
The 267 horsepower engine won at LeMans.

137
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:35.911
That's enough. There're police cars all around, you know?

138
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:39.811
I don't care. They were in the opposite lane.

139
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:42.911
While they're admiring this beauty of a car,

140
00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:45.211
we'll disappear from sight.

141
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:49.211
By the way, will you and Ran do that thing you always do?

142
00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:53.711
It's pretty tricky up ahead, okay?

143
00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:55.911
Please.

144
00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:58.411
Oh, good grief...

145
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.511
Thanks.

146
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.811
I hate to ask, but Ran, can you come up here?

147
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:07.211
Okay. What is it?

148
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:11.211
Don't worry, just trust me, it's only scary in the beginning.

149
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.811
I guess so.

150
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:23.111
What are you doing, Shinichi?

151
00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:25.111
Just hang on tight.

152
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:49.911
See, it wasn't so bad.

153
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:54.111
Are you crazy? How can you say that?

154
00:11:04.811 --> 00:11:06.911
It's exactly an hour before the curtain goes up.

155
00:11:06.911 --> 00:11:10.711
I told you. We got here right on time. No problem.

156
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.811
I guess I was wrong.

157
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:31.311
Your license and registration, please!

158
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:32.911
Okay, okay.

159
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:35.511
You were going 40 miles over the speed limit,

160
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:37.711
who do you think you are, Dirty Harry?

161
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:40.111
Oh, we were in a hurry.

162
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:43.911
You look familiar.

163
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:46.111
Well, your might have...

164
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:49.411
You might have met her on another case.

165
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:51.911
You see. She's one of us...

166
00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:53.411
Captain!

167
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:56.211
She is an undercover agent.

168
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:00.911
It looks like the criminal got away from her this time, though.

169
00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:05.011
Who's the old guy?

170
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:06.711
Radesh.

171
00:12:06.711 --> 00:12:08.911
Yusuke met him when he solved a case.

172
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:10.811
That's how they became friends,

173
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:12.711
he's a captain on the New York police force,

174
00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:14.911
his name's Radesh Redwood!

175
00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:18.711
His Japanese is pretty good since his wife's from Japan.

176
00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:26.711
Thank you, Radesh! That was embarrassing.

177
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.411
No problem,

178
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:30.211
it's not me you have to thank.

179
00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:32.611
I don't understand.

180
00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:37.611
If you want to thank someone, you can thank me.

181
00:13:02.661 --> 00:13:06.061
If you want to thank someone, you can thank me.

182
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.661
Thank me, Sharon Vineyard.

183
00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:22.661
Sharon.

184
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.361
What are you doing here?

185
00:13:24.361 --> 00:13:27.461
The officer who was just here. He's one of my fans.

186
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.361
He and I started talking while I was waiting for you,

187
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:32.561
then a police bulletin came in

188
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:37.361
about a silver Jaguar heading this way travelling at a ridiculous speed

189
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:42.461
and I came up with this idea of disguising myself as Captain Redwood.

190
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:44.161
You should be impressed.

191
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:48.161
This man's coat was pretty expensive.

192
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.561
I am impressed

193
00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:53.561
but are you sure it was okay? Everyone's looking at us.

194
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.461
Don't worry, it won't be a problem,

195
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.961
I told everybody we were filming a movie.

196
00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:03.361
Oh, Sharon. I just love you!

197
00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:06.861
Hey, mom. Explain things to me.

198
00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:09.161
Who is this lady?

199
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:10.761
You mean you don't know, Shinichi?

200
00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:12.861
She's a famous American actress!

201
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:15.061
Like I was saying,

202
00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:16.761
how can a famous actress like her

203
00:14:16.761 --> 00:14:19.461
disguise herself so well that nobody recognizes her?

204
00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:22.561
Didn't I ever tell you the story?

205
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:25.261
When I was just starting out as an actress,

206
00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:28.361
I got a role as a spy.

207
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:30.961
And to get into character,

208
00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:34.161
I signed up to study under a famous magician

209
00:14:34.161 --> 00:14:36.861
to learn how to disguise myself.

210
00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:41.661
Sharon was also there since she had gotten a similar role,

211
00:14:41.661 --> 00:14:43.661
that's how we became friends.

212
00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:47.161
Only thing is, I never got to be as good as her

213
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:50.061
she can disguise herself perfectly.

214
00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:53.361
Yeah, you were always fooling around

215
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:54.661
but you seemed to be playing dress-up,

216
00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:56.761
instead of disguising yourself.

217
00:14:57.961 --> 00:15:00.561
Sorry, I wasn't good enough for you.

218
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.461
But I was doing my best.

219
00:15:06.161 --> 00:15:07.461
I'm so thrilled!

220
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:12.461
I got to meet such a famous person and in New York, no less.

221
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:14.461
I've got to thank God for this.

222
00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.561
Does God really exist?

223
00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:37.761
If God does actually exist,

224
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:40.161
then all the people who are striving to survive

225
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:42.461
should be rewarded with happiness, isn't that right?

226
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:46.661
Yes, at the very least.

227
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:51.061
No angel ever smiled down on me,

228
00:15:51.061 --> 00:15:52.761
not even once.

229
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:02.261
The sadness in her smile

230
00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:05.261
might have been a premonition of things to come

231
00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:07.861
of the tragedy that would soon follow.

232
00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:14.661
I didn't want to remember that awful incident.

233
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:22.161
What do you mean by that?

234
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:24.961
About no angel ever smiling on you.

235
00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:27.561
She's trying to say she's had a hard time.

236
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.061
Isn't that right, Sharon?

237
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.361
That's right.

238
00:16:30.361 --> 00:16:33.461
My life's been one hardship after the other.

239
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.661
I struggled to become an actress

240
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.261
and on the day my debut film was to be shown

241
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:39.561
my parents died in a fire.

242
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:41.261
Then the day after I received the Oscar,

243
00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:43.061
my husband died from an illness.

244
00:16:45.361 --> 00:16:47.161
Then there's Crystal who made her debut so easily

245
00:16:47.161 --> 00:16:49.061
just because she was my daughter,

246
00:16:49.061 --> 00:16:50.861
everything was handed to her on a silver plate,

247
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:53.161
what a difference between us.

248
00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:55.261
Don't exaggerate.

249
00:16:55.261 --> 00:16:58.261
I know you're proud of her, you put everything into raising her.

250
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:03.761
That child, I don't consider her my daughter anymore.

251
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:04.761
What?

252
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:07.261
I don't know if you can believe this.

253
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.561
But she stood behind me

254
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.961
while I was putting flowers on my husband's grave

255
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.661
and she had disguised herself to look exactly like him.

256
00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:19.361
Don't you think it was rather sick to be considered a joke?

257
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:21.961
I just remembered what you once told me

258
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:23.561
you said you taught her how to disguise herself

259
00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:26.261
because she begged you so much.

260
00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:29.061
I haven't spoken to her since.

261
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:31.861
It's been almost 10 years

262
00:17:31.861 --> 00:17:35.561
and it seemed like she was hanging around some shady characters.

263
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:38.161
Enough about that, go park your car in the parking lot,

264
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:40.261
let's head for the dressing rooms.

265
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:45.761
I think those people have started to realize there are no cameras around.

266
00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:51.461
But why did you want us here an hour before the show starts?

267
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:54.561
We'd be less of a bother for everybody if we came earlier

268
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:58.561
and we'd have had more time to talk to the performers.

269
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:01.561
Don't be silly, if we came here earlier

270
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:03.061
the performers would still be just regular people,

271
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.961
but seeing them just before the show starts.

272
00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:18.661
"Lila Sanchez (32)" -Sharon is here.

273
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:20.961
You came to see us, after all!

274
00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:24.161
"Akane Nirusen (27)" -I guess our coach does tell the truth sometimes.

275
00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:26.061
"Rose Huide (28)" -How exciting! I'm so happy!

276
00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:27.661
This is like a dream!

277
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:29.161
I'm suprised you had time!

278
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:30.761
-Are you free today? -Let's go eat later!

279
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:32.761
Now I get it.

280
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:34.161
When we see them just before the show,

281
00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:37.461
they're already in makeup and they're actresses.

282
00:18:40.061 --> 00:18:42.461
They all adore her, don't they?

283
00:18:42.461 --> 00:18:47.361
Yes, they do. She knows their troupe leader very well,

284
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:49.361
when she said she wanted to come and give them her support

285
00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:52.461
she was handed to the tickets, just like that.

286
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:56.161
Is that who I think it is?

287
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:57.961
It sure is.

288
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:01.261
The people's favorite female private detective.

289
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:03.061
Night Baroness...

290
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:04.861
At your service!

291
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:06.661
Night Baroness?

292
00:19:08.261 --> 00:19:11.361
That's what she's called back here.

293
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:13.161
Because she's married to Yusuke Kudo,

294
00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:16.261
the author of the book "Night Baron".

295
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:20.361
And being married to a mystery writer, mom once appeared

296
00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:24.161
as a guest on a special investigative program on television here.

297
00:19:24.161 --> 00:19:28.361
She analyzed a crime and everything she said fit,

298
00:19:28.361 --> 00:19:31.361
the criminal was arrested right away.

299
00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:35.961
That's how she became so popular and they nicknamed her Night Baroness.

300
00:19:37.661 --> 00:19:43.461
But no one knew she was only repeating what dad mumbled

301
00:19:43.461 --> 00:19:46.761
while he read the newspaper every morning.

302
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:51.061
You mean those two are your children?

303
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:54.561
He is, but she isn't.

304
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:59.861
Maybe she'll become family in the future, though.

305
00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:01.661
How wonderful!

306
00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:03.261
She's so lucky!

307
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:08.561
Well, well.

308
00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:12.361
I thought the Night Baroness was here

309
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:15.461
to solve the mystery of the strange parcel.

310
00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:16.661
But I see she's only come to gossip

311
00:20:16.661 --> 00:20:18.461
and she's even brought her kids with her.

312
00:20:18.461 --> 00:20:21.561
"Everess Hamilton (30)" -I'm so disappointed.

313
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:24.361
Strange parcel?

314
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:25.661
That's right.

315
00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:29.661
A package was sent to the troupe 3 days ago.

316
00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:33.161
It was an apple sprayed with a golden coating,

317
00:20:33.161 --> 00:20:35.461
golden apple.

318
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:39.461
There was a message inside, it was written in animal blood and said,

319
00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:42.161
"To the most beautiful woman".

320
00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:43.961
I see.

321
00:20:43.961 --> 00:20:45.961
So that explains the ominous feeling I got

322
00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:49.661
when I walked into this dressing room.

323
00:20:50.961 --> 00:20:53.861
"Heath Flockhart (33)" -Just calm down, my lovelies.

324
00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:57.561
I'm sure it was just somebody's idea of a joke.

325
00:20:57.561 --> 00:20:59.361
But, Heath...

326
00:20:59.361 --> 00:21:00.561
Who's that?

327
00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:04.661
That's Heath Flockhart, the star of this theatrical group.

328
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:06.861
But tonight is his last performance

329
00:21:06.861 --> 00:21:09.861
because he got a role to star in a movie.

330
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.161
Okay, everybody cheer up.

331
00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:18.161
Let's all give Sharon and her friends the backstage tour.

332
00:21:23.661 --> 00:21:25.161
Are you sure it's all right?

333
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:27.161
The show starts in 40 minutes,

334
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.561
maybe we shouldn't be bothering them.

335
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:30.861
Don't worry about it.

336
00:21:30.861 --> 00:21:35.261
The first 20 minutes will be a narration,

337
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:38.361
a narrator will just go on and on about Greek mythology.

338
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:42.161
What's that up there?

339
00:21:43.161 --> 00:21:45.861
Oh, that. They're stage costumes.

340
00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:48.761
They have it suspended up there, so it doesn't get in the way.

341
00:21:56.061 --> 00:21:57.161
Look out!

342
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:58.561
Armor!

343
00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:26.761
Ran!

344
00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:28.961
Ran!

345
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.761
"Next Episode" -What?

346
00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:14.461
Mom, take care of Ran!

347
00:24:14.461 --> 00:24:15.861
Shin...

348
00:24:18.361 --> 00:24:19.861
Darn it.

349
00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:22.261
I knew I'd be too late.

350
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:25.961
A bullet casing?

351
00:24:28.861 --> 00:24:29.861
This is...

352
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:31.761
Next Conan,

353
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:35.761
"Shinichi In New York (Part 2)"

354
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.830
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.930
"Feathers"

356
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.430
I'm going to rack my brains on this one.

357
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.930
If you don't solve it by the next episode,

358
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.530
you're going to get smaller.
