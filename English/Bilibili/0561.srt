1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.040
A new tragedy occurs at the House of Death.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.440
Mr. Shusaku Akashi,

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.640
husband of Aoi who passed away three year ago

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.040
was confined to a room and starved to death.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.040
Just before his death,

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.040
Mr. Akashi had painted the wall on one side of the room entirely red.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.240
What on earth did he want to relay?

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.240
Just when questioning of the former residents of the house began,

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.240
one of them, musician Shiro Naoki, is murdered.

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.740
Like Mr. Akashi, he was found sitting on a chair

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.440
facing the wall that was painted entirely red.

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.340
Inspector Morofushi, who used to be one of Aoi's classmates,

13
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.940
despite the warning of another classmate, Inspector Yamato,

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.940
goes off to investigate on his own.

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.840
A text mail comes from Inspector Morofushi,

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.340
and written is the sentence,

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.740
Koume dies.

18
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.540
The House of Death is enveloped in flames.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.440
Although Inspector Morofushi is rescued from the fire

20
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.040
by Officer Uehara in the nick of time,

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.440
Inspector Morofushi is unconscious due to a blow on his head.

22
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.840
The meaning of the sentence, Koume dies, is still unknown,

23
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.940
the mystery of the case seemed unfathomable.

24
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.140
However, Ran's casual remark

25
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.040
drops a ray of light onto the mystery.

26
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.140
It is...

27
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.740
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

28
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.140
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

29
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
We're finally approaching the climax.

30
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.340
It's time to unravel the mystery of the red wall and real killer.

31
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:22.891
I get it!

35
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:24.691
Just looking at this red wall

36
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:28.791
isn't going to help us get to the answer of the dying message.

37
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:35.591
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Empty Fort Strategy)"

38
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:39.491
I see.

39
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.291
That's why the chairs of the first murder site

40
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:45.291
were painted black and white.

41
00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.491
Yep!

42
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:49.591
It seemed that the victim, Mr. Akashi

43
00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:52.391
liked chess too!

44
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:54.691
If so, why did the culprit

45
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:58.491
paint the wall of the second murder red?

46
00:03:58.491 --> 00:04:00.891
Because he was convinced that even if it were left that way,

47
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:04.291
no one would be able to figure it out.

48
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.291
I get it!

49
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.891
The dying message...

50
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.091
Was not the red wall to begin with!

51
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.891
Someone other than the culprit who would've had to do so is...

52
00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:16.591
Nobody else but Shiro Naoki!

53
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:17.991
Finally...

54
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.491
You've finally reached that conclusion.

55
00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:25.491
Ko... Koume?

56
00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:27.691
You've regained consciousness!

57
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.991
Are you okay, moving around like that?

58
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:32.891
Yes. I guess so.

59
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.691
If so, let's go nab the culprit on the double!

60
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:39.891
Mochi that is drawn on the ground

61
00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:42.691
cannot be consumed.

62
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:45.791
It's a pity that the deductions that we have reached

63
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.891
are no more than mochi drawn on the ground.

64
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.391
It's not edible at all.

65
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:53.191
In other words, you're saying that we have no proof.

66
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.191
But Mr. Shiro Naoki said

67
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:00.491
that he would soon be going to a place called Lecce in Italy,

68
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.091
so if you want to find him, come look for him there, right?

69
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:10.591
Oh, that's very meaningful.

70
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:12.991
If so, I've got a great idea.

71
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:14.791
That goes for me too.

72
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:15.991
Hey!

73
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:18.291
Leave this to me, of the Prefecture Police Department Headquarters!

74
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.691
Oh, no way.

75
00:05:20.691 --> 00:05:23.091
How about doing this, then?

76
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:26.291
Describe your strategy in one word

77
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.491
and display it on the screen of your cell phones

78
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:29.191
and show it to each other?

79
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:33.191
Just like Koume and Zhou did before the Battle of Red Cliffs!

80
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:36.491
All right.

81
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:38.691
Geez, what a hassle.

82
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:44.091
Here goes.

83
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:45.991
Ready, get set.

84
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:52.691
Just as I thought after all.

85
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:55.191
The Empty Fort Strategy!

86
00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:57.191
"Empty"

87
00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:01.191
I wish you'd cut it out, inspector.

88
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.291
Being called out like this so many times.

89
00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.791
You're going to run us out of business.

90
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:10.891
It's true that we used to live in this house before.

91
00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:12.791
But, I think it's just a coincidence

92
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:16.691
that all of our alibis for last night are ambiguous.

93
00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:17.891
Didn't I tell you that

94
00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:20.091
we were near the house that burned down

95
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.291
because we were summoned over by text mail?

96
00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:27.091
In the first place, did you solve the mystery of the red wall?

97
00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:30.091
We haven't solved that mystery yet.

98
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:34.091
But, it seems that Mr. Shiro Naoki who became the second victim,

99
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:36.691
have caught on to something.

100
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:38.491
Do you have any idea what it could be?

101
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:40.091
I wonder.

102
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:42.991
I only know that he was in need of money.

103
00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:46.291
He was saying he was going on a trip soon.

104
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:50.591
That's right, to a place in Italy called Lecce.

105
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:53.791
Then maybe he was going to walk over there

106
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:55.691
to the place called Lecce

107
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:58.891
to hide something important!

108
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:01.591
Besides, it seems that he also said

109
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:04.791
to come to look for him there after he's gone.

110
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.891
Why would he walk over?

111
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.391
Because Italy is shaped like a shoe, isn't it?

112
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.491
At any rate!

113
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:15.591
If you want to investigate us any further...

114
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:18.991
Do that after you find necessary proof.

115
00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:21.591
We don't have all the time in the world too, you see.

116
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.191
See you.

117
00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:24.491
If you will excuse me then.

118
00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.691
We've done what needs to be done,

119
00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:34.191
so now we sit and wait, right?

120
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:35.591
Those who travel a 100 miles

121
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:37.891
regard 90 miles as only half.

122
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:39.991
We should keep on our guard.

123
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:41.591
Yeah.

124
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:44.591
We can't afford not solving this case, after we've come this far.

125
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:54.091
PC60, PC60.

126
00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:56.091
A taxi robbery occurred in the industry area...

127
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:58.691
Darn. Just as I thought,

128
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:01.991
there are officers staked out even in back of Shiro's apartment.

129
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:04.491
So, it was a trap after all.

130
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:06.891
What? A taxi robbery?

131
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:07.991
Near here?

132
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:10.491
Yeah, they want us there on the double.

133
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:18.491
What happened? Are they going to leave?

134
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:21.391
Which means that, this apartment is going to be empty.

135
00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:29.091
No, wait.

136
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.091
The drunkard that fell forward in front of the apartment just now

137
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.091
and the man wearing the mask

138
00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:35.391
that've been loitering around from a while ago.

139
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:39.091
One of them could be an officer.

140
00:08:39.091 --> 00:08:44.091
Sir, you'll catch cold sleeping in a place like this!

141
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.991
Shut up! Stay out of this!

142
00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:50.091
Idiot! Who gives a hoot about the chairman...

143
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:53.391
I guess the drunkard's not an officer.

144
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:55.891
Hey, you. Are you all right?

145
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.091
You're so drunk.

146
00:08:59.691 --> 00:09:02.991
I can go another two or three shops!

147
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.491
Hey!

148
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:07.091
Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:12.191
I broke my leg!

150
00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:14.791
Are you all right?

151
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.091
Hey, jerk!

152
00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:19.491
Give me a million yen to pay for what you did!

153
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:21.391
1 million yen?

154
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.591
I don't have that much money!

155
00:09:23.591 --> 00:09:26.091
Then, give me your wallet and all!

156
00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:27.291
No!

157
00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:28.991
He's mugging the man?

158
00:09:28.991 --> 00:09:31.591
If the man wearing the mask is an officer,

159
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.391
he would never overlook this.

160
00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:44.091
Now I can go drink some more.

161
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:46.191
Are you sure?

162
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:50.091
Darn it.

163
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.991
What should I tell my mother?

164
00:09:57.191 --> 00:09:58.791
What?

165
00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:02.191
Don't tell me that the man is an underwear thief?

166
00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:10.991
Hey! He's going into Shiro's room now.

167
00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:16.991
Absurd! If he does that...

168
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:22.191
The officers staking out outside of the apartment will get him.

169
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.291
They're gone.

170
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.691
Right, the police cars that were staking out here

171
00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:30.691
went to the taxi robbery site too.

172
00:10:37.091 --> 00:10:38.191
The man who went in a while ago's

173
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:40.191
coming out from Shiro's room.

174
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:44.091
A mugger, underwear thief and a break in.

175
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:47.391
No doubt about it! The police aren't staking out.

176
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:58.691
I'll go get the stuff now while they're gone, then.

177
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:02.591
Which one? Which one?

178
00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:04.591
Which shoe did he hide it in?

179
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:06.291
Could it be that...

180
00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:11.391
you're looking for this shoe?

181
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:15.091
This shoe is a bit different, isn't it?

182
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.991
The heel comes off

183
00:11:16.991 --> 00:11:21.991
and the memory card of a cell phone is inside!

184
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:23.391
Yes.

185
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.391
Right where Lecce of Italy is located on the map,

186
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:27.791
by the heel of the shoe!

187
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:31.791
Too bad you couldn't find it before I did.

188
00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.791
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa?

189
00:11:49.288 --> 00:11:51.188
Who the heck are you?

190
00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:52.588
Oh, come on.

191
00:11:52.588 --> 00:11:55.988
We've met so many times, have you forgotten?

192
00:11:56.888 --> 00:11:58.988
Conan Edogawa.

193
00:11:58.988 --> 00:12:00.388
A detective.

194
00:12:00.388 --> 00:12:02.688
It's you?

195
00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:05.188
But, I'm sure...

196
00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:06.888
You...

197
00:12:06.888 --> 00:12:08.388
Haven't forgotten...

198
00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:09.888
Us!

199
00:12:09.888 --> 00:12:11.388
Then the mugging

200
00:12:11.388 --> 00:12:13.288
and thief breaking in that I saw a while ago were...

201
00:12:13.288 --> 00:12:14.788
Yeah.

202
00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:18.188
It's the Empty Fort Strategy!

203
00:12:18.188 --> 00:12:21.188
The Empty Fort Strategy?

204
00:12:21.188 --> 00:12:23.688
With only the police cars withdrawing,

205
00:12:23.688 --> 00:12:27.288
you may suspect that the officers are still hiding,

206
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.688
but if in the midst of this psychological circumstance,

207
00:12:29.688 --> 00:12:32.288
the people who were around the apartment

208
00:12:32.288 --> 00:12:34.688
act unlike police officers

209
00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:37.088
and further crimes are committed,

210
00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:41.588
your suspicion will soon subside.

211
00:12:41.588 --> 00:12:43.988
The Empty Fort Strategy

212
00:12:43.988 --> 00:12:46.888
is when someone deliberately loosens one's guard

213
00:12:46.888 --> 00:12:48.488
under the pretense of luring the enemy over,

214
00:12:48.488 --> 00:12:50.888
when actually he keeps the enemy away.

215
00:12:50.888 --> 00:12:53.788
But ours has the opposite effect.

216
00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:59.688
So, you talked about the shoe at the station

217
00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:03.688
to lure me out here after all.

218
00:13:03.688 --> 00:13:09.288
No, we knew from the start that you would show up here.

219
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.188
It bothered me to begin with.

220
00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:13.888
I couldn't understand why the culprit also left behind

221
00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:17.988
the dying message of the victim of the first murder site,

222
00:13:17.988 --> 00:13:20.588
at the second murder site.

223
00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:23.088
But, if that red wall was not

224
00:13:23.088 --> 00:13:26.588
a dying message left behind by the victim...

225
00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:29.488
Right. If it were painted not by the victim nor the culprit,

226
00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:31.288
but rather, a third person...

227
00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:34.688
It's understandable that the culprit would deliberately

228
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:37.788
leave behind the red wall at the second murder site

229
00:13:37.788 --> 00:13:41.088
in order to confuse investigation of the police.

230
00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.088
Are you saying that the third person

231
00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.988
is Mr. Shiro Naoki?

232
00:13:44.988 --> 00:13:46.588
Yeah.

233
00:13:46.588 --> 00:13:47.788
If someone other than the culprit

234
00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:51.488
were to have painted over Mr. Akashi's red paint,

235
00:13:51.488 --> 00:13:55.488
the only thinkable thing is that he would've written in katakana.

236
00:13:55.488 --> 00:13:59.888
"I was killed by Naoki".

237
00:13:59.888 --> 00:14:02.388
In other words, that you,

238
00:14:02.388 --> 00:14:04.588
Naoki Midorikawa is the culprit!

239
00:14:04.588 --> 00:14:07.888
I see. So, Mr. Shiro Naoki who came to beg for money,

240
00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:11.088
happened to coincidentally find the message,

241
00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:12.888
thought it was referring to him

242
00:14:12.888 --> 00:14:16.488
and painted the wall entirely red.

243
00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:19.288
If it were written in katakana rather than Chinese characters,

244
00:14:19.288 --> 00:14:21.088
he wouldn't have made that mistake.

245
00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:24.988
That's probably because he wrote using spray paint.

246
00:14:24.988 --> 00:14:27.588
The fine details of the characters would disappear with spray.

247
00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:32.388
And, while he was spraying red paint on the wall,

248
00:14:32.388 --> 00:14:34.988
he realized that

249
00:14:34.988 --> 00:14:36.588
the "Naoki" that was written there

250
00:14:36.588 --> 00:14:39.188
was not his last name, Naoki, but, rather,

251
00:14:39.188 --> 00:14:41.888
the name of the only person that Mr. Akashi used to call by name,

252
00:14:41.888 --> 00:14:46.788
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, he was referring to you.

253
00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:50.988
And, he took a picture of the half-erased characters with cell phone,

254
00:14:50.988 --> 00:14:53.588
and decided to blackmail you.

255
00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:54.688
Isn't that right?

256
00:14:55.188 --> 00:14:56.588
Yeah, right.

257
00:14:56.588 --> 00:15:02.788
That's why I strangled Shiro in this room where he called me over to.

258
00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:04.388
Darn!

259
00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:06.188
If only Shiro didn't come into the room

260
00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:08.088
where I starved Shusaku to death.

261
00:15:08.088 --> 00:15:11.288
If only I had painted the entire wall red.

262
00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:13.088
Don't tell me

263
00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:16.788
you still don't understand the meaning of the red wall, sir?

264
00:15:16.788 --> 00:15:20.388
The dying message would only be complete

265
00:15:20.388 --> 00:15:23.188
after the culprit himself paints the entire wall red.

266
00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:25.288
What do you mean?

267
00:15:25.288 --> 00:15:27.888
Do you know what an after image of a complementary color is?

268
00:15:27.888 --> 00:15:29.888
After image of a complementary color?

269
00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.888
It's a phenomenon of which after staring at a certain color for some time,

270
00:15:31.888 --> 00:15:33.788
then looking at a different place after that,

271
00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:38.488
the complementary color that was being looked at a while ago remains!

272
00:15:38.488 --> 00:15:41.488
You see, the surgical gown that surgeons wear

273
00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:43.488
is light green colored, right?

274
00:15:43.488 --> 00:15:46.788
That's because when they have to look at red blood during surgery,

275
00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:49.088
the after image of the complementary color green

276
00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:50.588
gets in the way of concentration.

277
00:15:50.588 --> 00:15:51.788
Therefore, wearing a gown of the same green color

278
00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:53.488
softens the effect.

279
00:15:53.488 --> 00:15:57.088
In other words, that red wall was also a dying message

280
00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.588
using the after image supplementary color effect!

281
00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:01.388
In that room,

282
00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:03.988
the white chair faced the red wall

283
00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:05.888
and the black chair was facing the white wall,

284
00:16:05.888 --> 00:16:07.488
and both were nailed to the floor.

285
00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:11.388
This was done to set the rail to solve the message!

286
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.688
Mr. Shusaku used to like playing chess.

287
00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:16.488
In chess, the white piece gets to go first

288
00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:18.388
and the black follow.

289
00:16:18.388 --> 00:16:19.488
In other words,

290
00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:23.588
after sitting in the white chair staring at the red wall,

291
00:16:23.588 --> 00:16:26.588
if you sit in the black chair and stare at the white wall,

292
00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:29.688
the after image of green, the complementary color of red,

293
00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:34.788
will show up vividly on the white wall.

294
00:16:34.788 --> 00:16:37.588
Midori (green), which means you,

295
00:16:37.588 --> 00:16:39.288
Mr. Midorikawa.

296
00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:41.588
That's why Mr. Akashi

297
00:16:41.588 --> 00:16:44.088
threw out all the other paints he had from the window,

298
00:16:44.088 --> 00:16:46.588
except for the red paint.

299
00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:49.788
So that the wall wouldn't be painted using any other color.

300
00:16:49.788 --> 00:16:51.788
In other words, he assumed that

301
00:16:51.788 --> 00:16:56.188
you would be the first to discover his dead body

302
00:16:56.188 --> 00:16:59.388
and erase whatever he wrote and left behind.

303
00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:01.388
He outwitted you by scheming it

304
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:03.888
so that you would disclose yourself as the culprit

305
00:17:03.888 --> 00:17:05.588
by painting the entire wall.

306
00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:07.988
That was the dying message he left behind.

307
00:17:08.888 --> 00:17:10.088
It's indeed as the saying goes,

308
00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:13.788
"Koume's men follow his orders even after his death!"

309
00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:15.188
Exactly.

310
00:17:19.088 --> 00:17:22.388
By me painting the entire wall, eh?

311
00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:26.488
What a guy.

312
00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:29.088
He goes and paints over an important portrait

313
00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:33.488
and ruthlessly kills a precious person, and yet...

314
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:35.988
You mean, that portrait...

315
00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.688
Yeah.

316
00:17:37.688 --> 00:17:39.088
The portrait that Aoi kept looking for

317
00:17:39.088 --> 00:17:41.288
until she collapsed from a heart attack

318
00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:46.288
that Shusaku drew of her long ago.

319
00:17:46.288 --> 00:17:49.088
That portrait was found!

320
00:17:49.088 --> 00:17:51.288
It was underneath another totally different portrait

321
00:17:51.288 --> 00:17:53.388
that I bought a year ago!

322
00:17:53.388 --> 00:17:55.588
Underneath?

323
00:17:55.588 --> 00:17:59.788
I bought it because it looked a bit like Aoi.

324
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.888
But, I decided to check for myself anyway.

325
00:18:01.888 --> 00:18:04.388
I had it checked by X-Ray,

326
00:18:04.388 --> 00:18:07.088
and found Aoi's portrait as it emerged

327
00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:09.888
from underneath that drawing!

328
00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.488
That guy Shusaku

329
00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:14.288
painted Aoi's portrait all white

330
00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:16.988
and drew another drawing in place of it!

331
00:18:16.988 --> 00:18:19.288
Oh no.

332
00:18:19.288 --> 00:18:20.688
It's true that Shusaku's drawings

333
00:18:20.688 --> 00:18:23.788
started to gain attention these past two to three years.

334
00:18:23.788 --> 00:18:27.088
I understand that he couldn't help but do something like that back then,

335
00:18:27.088 --> 00:18:31.088
because when he drew that picture,

336
00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:33.388
he didn't even have the money to buy a canvas.

337
00:18:33.388 --> 00:18:37.588
Why didn't he tell Aoi about it?

338
00:18:37.588 --> 00:18:41.088
If he had only said something about it to Aoi,

339
00:18:41.088 --> 00:18:44.888
she wouldn't have had to die.

340
00:18:44.888 --> 00:18:46.188
Why did he keep quiet

341
00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:48.788
and locked himself in room to continue painting?

342
00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:51.088
I locked him in the room to give him a taste of his own medicine,

343
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:54.988
to understand how terrible Aoi may have felt.

344
00:18:56.488 --> 00:18:59.188
The day after Aoi passed away.

345
00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:05.688
When I visited that house,

346
00:19:05.688 --> 00:19:08.588
a portrait was being burned in the yard.

347
00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:12.788
It was Aoi's portrait with paint

348
00:19:12.788 --> 00:19:15.488
that wasn't completely dried yet.

349
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:16.588
Do you mean that

350
00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:19.888
the picture that Mr. Akashi was drawing locked up in his room was...

351
00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:22.588
I'm sure it was that picture.

352
00:19:22.588 --> 00:19:24.588
He probably locked himself in his room

353
00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:27.188
and kept drawing her portrait in order to finish it in time

354
00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:30.388
and surprise her with the drawing on her birthday,

355
00:19:30.388 --> 00:19:32.588
that was the following day.

356
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:36.288
No!

357
00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:41.988
Just what have I done?

358
00:19:41.988 --> 00:19:43.788
Aoi.

359
00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:45.388
Shusaku.

360
00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:50.888
No one should interfere with the intimate relationship of others.

361
00:19:50.888 --> 00:19:53.388
In other words, no third-party interference is needed

362
00:19:53.388 --> 00:19:58.188
when two people have an intimate relationship with each other.

363
00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:25.488
Okay, Koume,

364
00:21:25.488 --> 00:21:27.688
I'll leave the rest for you to finish then!

365
00:21:27.688 --> 00:21:32.688
Well, you're the one who first solved the mystery of the red wall.

366
00:21:32.688 --> 00:21:34.088
It bugs me a bit,

367
00:21:34.088 --> 00:21:36.988
but I'll leave submitting the report of the case to you!

368
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:39.888
It's just as I thought, after all.

369
00:21:41.688 --> 00:21:44.288
It seems that you said you stuck that boy to me

370
00:21:44.288 --> 00:21:47.388
so that he could watch over me.

371
00:21:47.388 --> 00:21:52.088
But, doing something like that would be risking too much

372
00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:54.988
being that I was on the list of suspects too.

373
00:21:54.988 --> 00:21:59.088
You had no doubt that I was innocent to begin with,

374
00:21:59.088 --> 00:22:03.988
but made that boy accompany me anyway, didn't you?

375
00:22:03.988 --> 00:22:06.888
You chose him as a partner to pierce through the truth of the case.

376
00:22:06.888 --> 00:22:09.888
Hey, he's still a kid, you know.

377
00:22:09.888 --> 00:22:13.288
When we the police were getting frustrated

378
00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:15.888
at the scene of the second murder,

379
00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:18.588
deducing that it was the culprit challenging the police,

380
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:20.988
that boy kept his cool and remarked.

381
00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:25.588
But, I wonder if the culprit wasn't scared?

382
00:22:25.588 --> 00:22:28.288
To copy the dying message without even knowing

383
00:22:28.288 --> 00:22:32.388
about the murder site in detail!

384
00:22:32.388 --> 00:22:34.488
If he didn't mention what he did,

385
00:22:34.488 --> 00:22:38.588
I wonder if we would've ever arrived at the truth of the red wall.

386
00:22:38.588 --> 00:22:41.288
Much less, the place where the evidence was hidden.

387
00:22:41.288 --> 00:22:43.988
We arrived at the answer because the boy

388
00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:46.788
mentioned information about Lecce.

389
00:22:46.788 --> 00:22:50.188
You planned it so that I would solve the case this way,

390
00:22:50.188 --> 00:22:51.688
give me credit for it

391
00:22:51.688 --> 00:22:56.288
and get me to return to the Nagano Prefectural Police Station...

392
00:22:57.288 --> 00:22:58.988
but that's all uncalled for.

393
00:22:58.988 --> 00:23:01.988
If our positions were reversed,

394
00:23:01.988 --> 00:23:05.388
you would've done the same, wouldn't you?

395
00:23:05.388 --> 00:23:10.088
I would've worked it out more cleverly.

396
00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:13.188
So, you wouldn't have realized a tinge of what I was doing.

397
00:23:13.188 --> 00:23:15.688
Oh, I see, I get it!

398
00:23:15.688 --> 00:23:17.388
This case is mine!

399
00:23:17.388 --> 00:23:19.888
You can stay at the local police for life, then!

400
00:23:24.388 --> 00:23:25.888
But, Kansuke.

401
00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:32.388
I really appreciate you letting me meet the boy.

402
00:23:32.388 --> 00:23:35.088
Thanks to him, it's come back to me.

403
00:23:36.588 --> 00:23:41.688
A phrase that I love, from a book that I love with all my heart,

404
00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:47.388
"The boy, as if he had seen through the entire truth,"

405
00:23:47.388 --> 00:23:49.488
"remarked quietly with cool eyes"

406
00:23:49.488 --> 00:23:50.688
"and seriously,"

407
00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:54.788
"started disclosing the truth."

408
00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:55.988
"Right."

409
00:23:55.988 --> 00:23:57.688
"Just like that famed strategist,"

410
00:23:57.688 --> 00:24:00.088
"Koume Shokatsuryo."

411
00:24:03.188 --> 00:24:03.358
The rainbow colored trademark is what makes it popular!
