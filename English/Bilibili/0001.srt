1
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:48.545
Could you get serious for a moment,
Inspector Megure?

2
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:52.095
How long do you intend to
detain all of my guests?

3
00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:56.315
We don't have any more time to be
part of your fruitless investigation!

4
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.715
Now, now, sir.

5
00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:01.735
The victim was a guest
invited to your party--

6
00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:05.715
President Yamazaki of Yatsubishi Bank!

7
00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:07.655
Please have a little more patience.

8
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.615
Are you suggesting that
the one responsible is in this room?

9
00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.115
Precisely.

10
00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.665
The door was locked from the inside.

11
00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:18.825
The killer entered from the next
window over on the 3rd floor

12
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:21.035
and then left the same way.

13
00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:23.035
There were no footprints
below the window,

14
00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:26.635
which points to the fact
that this was an inside job.

15
00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:30.245
Nonsense! It's almost
10 meters to the next window!

16
00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:31.805
Jumping from one to
the other is impossible!

17
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:35.535
If the killer used the edge of the
roof to get across to the next window,

18
00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.995
there would be less than 2
meters left to the veranda

19
00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:40.025
of the room where Mr. Yamazaki was.

20
00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.115
What childish reasoning.

21
00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:44.535
So how did the killer leave then?

22
00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:47.825
There's no way they could have
jumped the 2 meters to the roof edge,

23
00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:49.735
which only sticks 10 centimeters out!

24
00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:55.175
The killer brought some rope
when leaving the next room over,

25
00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:59.665
affixed it to the veranda,
and then later used it to return.

26
00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:04.405
But then how was the rope removed
from the veranda afterward?

27
00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:06.335
It's simple, Inspector Megure!

28
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:10.705
A stick was tied to one end of the
rope and attached to the veranda.

29
00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:12.805
It easily came undone when tugged.

30
00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:15.905
Check the veranda.

31
00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.645
You should find marks from when
the rope was affixed to it!

32
00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:22.605
But what was Mr. Yamazaki
doing inside a locked room?

33
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:26.705
Most likely, the killer told him
to wait there with the door locked

34
00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:30.735
because he had something
important and secret to tell him.

35
00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.785
I've had enough of your pompous talk!

36
00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.865
Just who was it who broke in and
killed Mr. Yamazaki, my best friend?!

37
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:38.455
There is only one person who knows
enough of this house's layout

38
00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:44.085
and who could walk throughout it
without raising any suspicion.

39
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:45.775
That person is...

40
00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:49.385
That person is...

41
00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:56.745
None other than you!

42
00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.605
You must be joking!
My leg hasn't even healed yet!

43
00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:05.955
There is always only one truth!

44
00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:09.865
Y-Your leg!

45
00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:11.155
Oh no!

46
00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:15.155
Your leg healed 3 months ago!

47
00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:16.955
Isn't that right, Inspector Megure?

48
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:18.285
Give it up.

49
00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:20.125
Your physician has
disclosed everything!

50
00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:23.285
We also know that you and
your best friend, Mr. Yamazaki,

51
00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:26.295
had under-the-table
financial dealings.

52
00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:28.045
Oh, no you don't!

53
00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:32.285
Goal!

54
00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:40.705
I'm really in your debt, Kudo-kun!

55
00:04:40.705 --> 00:04:42.395
Thanks for always
being there to help!

56
00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.905
No problem at all.

57
00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:46.785
If you run into any other
difficult cases,

58
00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.855
feel free to contact me,
Detective Shinichi Kudo!

59
00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:54.825
The Roller Coaster Murder Case!

60
00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:07.755
What the...?

61
00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:13.465
Give me a break here,
Professor Agasa!

62
00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:16.455
I just thought I'd wake you up!

63
00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:19.305
Works better than an alarm clock,
wouldn't you agree?

64
00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:25.115
The number of books you have
here never ceases to amaze me!

65
00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.325
Well, it was because of all these

66
00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:30.735
that your father was able to become
an international mystery writer.

67
00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:32.905
Stop moving around, Professor.

68
00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:34.405
Oh, sorry.

69
00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:36.195
What were you testing this time?

70
00:05:36.195 --> 00:05:40.655
Don't tell this to anyone, got it?!
This is just between you and me!

71
00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:43.865
This is a Personal Mobility Rocket!

72
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:46.655
Once I perfect it, traffic jams
will become a thing of the past

73
00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.325
and I'll be filthy rich!

74
00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:57.055
What are these? Oh, books.

75
00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:02.095
Hopeless.

76
00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:08.825
Dammit! That stupid kid again!

77
00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.115
Get a hold of yourself, Dad.

78
00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:13.865
It's 'cause he's a high school student
playing a detective

79
00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:15.235
that I hardly ever
get any jobs anymore!

80
00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:18.695
It can't be helped.
Shinichi is just really good at it.

81
00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:21.205
I have to make a living, you know!

82
00:06:22.495 --> 00:06:23.905
I'm going to school now!

83
00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.665
Go wherever you want!

84
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.245
The famous detective Shinichi Kudo!

85
00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:30.115
The modern-day Japanese
Sherlock Holmes!

86
00:06:30.115 --> 00:06:33.835
Also considered by many as the Savior
of the Japanese police department!

87
00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:37.035
Shinichi Kudo is so cool!

88
00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:39.515
Maybe I should write him a love letter!

89
00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:46.365
Ran Mori - 2nd year student, Teitan High
You're so stupid!

90
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:47.565
Grinning like you're some big shot...
Ran Mori - 2nd year student, Teitan High

91
00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:50.205
What're you so angry about, Ran?

92
00:06:50.205 --> 00:06:51.575
Nothing at all.

93
00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:57.575
I'm not mad at all that my dad
can't get any work because of you.

94
00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:03.905
It's not my fault your dad doesn't get
much work, he's just not good at it.

95
00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:10.835
But I told you, I'm not mad at all...

96
00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:14.795
Just what I'd expect from
the head of the karate club...

97
00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:32.855
If you hadn't quit the soccer club,
you would've been a big hero here...

98
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:39.035
I only did soccer to acquire the physical
prowess that all detectives need!

99
00:07:39.035 --> 00:07:41.575
Holmes had his fencing, after all...

100
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:44.205
But those are just novels.

101
00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:46.535
But he's a detective
that everyone's heard of!

102
00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:49.115
He's so amazing!

103
00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:52.115
He's always calm and composed
no matter the situation,

104
00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:54.535
and he's practically overflowing
with intelligence and refinement!

105
00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:57.785
And his keen powers of observation
and deduction are unparalleled!

106
00:07:58.615 --> 00:08:01.085
On top of that, his violin skills
are equal to those of a professional!

107
00:08:02.155 --> 00:08:08.975
Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes
is the world's greatest detective!

108
00:08:09.285 --> 00:08:13.275
If you like him so much, why don't
you become a writer like your dad?

109
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:17.485
I don't want to write about
detectives, I want to BE one!

110
00:08:18.825 --> 00:08:20.945
The modern-day Japanese
Sherlock Holmes!

111
00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:25.405
The exhilaration from catching
the bad guys is beyond description!

112
00:08:26.285 --> 00:08:29.615
Try being a detective once
and there's no going back!

113
00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:32.745
And look at all these fan letters!
Detectives are popular!

114
00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:37.795
It's fine that you're always flirting
with girls, but at least choose a favorite!

115
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:41.515
My favorite...

116
00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:47.085
What're you staring at?

117
00:08:48.075 --> 00:08:51.455
No, nothing! We better hurry
or we'll miss class!

118
00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:52.055
Wait!

119
00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:57.035
You haven't forgotten your
promise for tomorrow, right?

120
00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:57.855
My promise?

121
00:08:58.325 --> 00:09:00.035
Come on!

122
00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:05.575
You said if I won the karate tournament
that you'd take me to Tropical Land!

123
00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:08.075
Sicko!

124
00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:11.745
I... remember...

125
00:09:40.485 --> 00:09:41.865
Ayumi Yoshida

126
00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:43.445
That was so totally fun!
Ayumi Yoshida

127
00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:45.615
Genta Kojima
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya
No, it was so totally bad for the heart!

128
00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:46.905
Let's go home...
Genta Kojima
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya

129
00:09:47.245 --> 00:09:50.865
For a big guy, you sure get
scared easy, Genta-kun...

130
00:09:50.865 --> 00:09:53.375
But the Mystery Coaster should
be okay for you two, right?

131
00:09:53.745 --> 00:09:57.795
Ayumi-chan, we only have enough
left for the train back home.

132
00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:01.755
That's fine! Just leave it to me!

133
00:10:08.705 --> 00:10:12.285
Hey, look, Shinichi! There's room
on the Mystery Coaster! Let's go!

134
00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:18.955
Tryin' to sneak in for free, huh?

135
00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:21.605
Kids these days...

136
00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:30.365
The coolest thing about Holmes is
when he first met his assistant Watson,

137
00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:35.825
he could tell he went to Afghanistan as
a military doctor just by shaking his hand!

138
00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:37.705
Like this!

139
00:10:39.825 --> 00:10:42.285
You're in a gymnastics club, aren't you?

140
00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:43.825
H-how did you know?!

141
00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:45.585
Do you know him, Hitomi?

142
00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:50.205
It was the blisters on her hand.

143
00:10:50.205 --> 00:10:55.155
Only girls who train on the horizontal
bar ever get this many of them.

144
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.815
But you can get blisters
doing tennis too...

145
00:10:58.365 --> 00:11:04.155
Actually, I saw earlier when
the wind blew her skirt up!

146
00:11:04.155 --> 00:11:06.155
Only those with experience
on the horizontal bar

147
00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:09.025
get marks like that
on their thighs!

148
00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:11.735
It's not fair if you
knew from the start.

149
00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:14.415
How long are you going
to keep holding her hand?

150
00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:16.955
Oh, right!

151
00:11:16.955 --> 00:11:20.205
Hey, you! Quit botherin' my pals!

152
00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:23.875
A friend of yours? In that case,
why don't we switch places in line?

153
00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:26.115
No, that's okay!

154
00:11:26.115 --> 00:11:29.705
Plus it'd be impolite to disturb
Aiko and Kishida-kun!

155
00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:37.205
Ran...

156
00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:39.115
I've liked you ever since I was--

157
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.365
Shinichi...

158
00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:41.575
Me too...

159
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:42.355
Shinichi!

160
00:11:42.865 --> 00:11:44.035
Let's go! We can get on!

161
00:11:44.035 --> 00:11:45.355
Oh, right!

162
00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:48.115
Now what do we do?!

163
00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:50.615
Now we just get in line for seats!

164
00:11:50.615 --> 00:11:52.655
Which way is the line?

165
00:11:52.655 --> 00:11:54.325
That's what we're trying to find out!

166
00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:58.205
...and then Holmes...

167
00:11:58.205 --> 00:12:00.865
Out of the way! We're first!

168
00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:07.885
So do you see? Conan Doyle must
have wanted to be like Holmes!

169
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:13.305
Cut it out with Holmes and Doyle,
you big mystery geek!

170
00:12:15.995 --> 00:12:20.455
I looked so forward to coming
here with you, Shinichi...

171
00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:24.105
Why can't you see the way
I feel about you?

172
00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:27.315
Ran...

173
00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:29.905
Um, actually, I feel the same...

174
00:12:29.905 --> 00:12:32.155
Got you! What're
you so nervous about?

175
00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:34.155
I'm obviously just kidding around!

176
00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:37.495
You won't make a good detective
if you're tricked so easily!

177
00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:38.285
Bah.

178
00:12:42.615 --> 00:12:43.605
But you know...

179
00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:47.165
I really did look forward to this!

180
00:13:05.405 --> 00:13:06.185
Water?

181
00:13:11.285 --> 00:13:13.325
What was that?!

182
00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.155
Let's get the heck outta here!

183
00:13:18.955 --> 00:13:20.535
What's this?

184
00:13:33.115 --> 00:13:34.995
Those are police cars!

185
00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:35.885
Hey, there.

186
00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:38.745
We didn't sneak in for free!

187
00:13:39.615 --> 00:13:42.935
Aren't you that high school detective?!

188
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.065
Shinichi Kudo's the name.

189
00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:55.155
Why Kishida-kun?!

190
00:13:55.155 --> 00:13:55.985
How horrible...

191
00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:58.785
We don't have time to loiter around
because of an ordinary accident!

192
00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:00.035
Let us leave already.

193
00:14:00.035 --> 00:14:02.205
Wrong! This was a murder!

194
00:14:02.705 --> 00:14:07.995
And the culprit was one of the 7
other people on the roller coaster!

195
00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:10.125
Shinichi! Where did you go?!

196
00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:12.505
Is that the truth, Kudo-kun?!

197
00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:14.005
What?! Kudo?!

198
00:14:16.405 --> 00:14:19.615
That's Shinichi Kudo, the famous
high school student detective?!

199
00:14:19.615 --> 00:14:21.345
He's the Savior of the
Japanese police department!

200
00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:24.555
So he's Kudo.

201
00:14:25.035 --> 00:14:29.085
So, temporarily taking you
and Ran-kun out of the picture,

202
00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:30.275
there were 5 passengers total.

203
00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:35.745
Passengers A and B in the first row
were both friends of the victim.

204
00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:41.825
C, who was both friend and girlfriend
to the victim, was in the third row.

205
00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:45.995
And D and E were the men in
black who sat behind the victim.

206
00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:50.615
But everyone had their
safety guards on,

207
00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:55.465
so only the woman sitting next to
him could have committed the murder!

208
00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:57.825
Hurry up, will you?

209
00:14:57.825 --> 00:15:01.135
We don't have time for your
little detective games!

210
00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:04.595
What's with this guy's icy stare?

211
00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.805
He's glaring like he's killed lots of
people before without a second thought.

212
00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:10.895
W-Who is he?!

213
00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:14.155
Inspector! There's a knife
in this woman's purse!

214
00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:16.565
No way! I've never seen
that before in my life!

215
00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:21.535
Aiko! And I thought you and
Kishida-kun were on good terms...

216
00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:22.375
How could you...?

217
00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:24.155
N-No! I didn't do it!

218
00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:28.585
It's obvious the girl did it!
We'll be leaving now.

219
00:15:28.585 --> 00:15:31.795
Alright! Take her into custody
as the prime suspect!

220
00:15:32.205 --> 00:15:34.245
Wait, Inspector!

221
00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:35.755
She isn't the murderer.

222
00:15:36.075 --> 00:15:38.635
Eh?! T-Then who is...?

223
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:44.615
There is always only one truth!

224
00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:48.225
The one responsible...

225
00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:50.285
...is you!

226
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.350
W-What are you talking about?!

227
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.770
The knife was in Aiko's purse!

228
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.850
Severing a person's head with
such a knife would be impossible.

229
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.740
Especially for a young woman.

230
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:19.950
You put the knife in Aiko's purse
in advance to put the blame on her.

231
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.190
But she was sitting
in the very front row!

232
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.770
Doesn't that make it impossible?!

233
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.020
No, it's entirely possible if
she utilized the coaster's speed

234
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.630
in conjunction with a bit
of piano wire or some rope.

235
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.890
Everyone ready?

236
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.350
I'm the murderer and
Inspector Megure is the victim.

237
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.430
First, before pulling
the safety guard down,

238
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.390
I put a purse-like
object behind my back.

239
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.390
Then the guard comes down and... See?

240
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.600
With the extra space,
it's easy to slip out.

241
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.440
Next, I take out a pre-prepared
rope with a hook at the end.

242
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.310
Then I put my legs around the guard,
stretch back, and place the rope loop

243
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.620
around the victim's neck.

244
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.620
All while inside a pitch-black
tunnel, of course.

245
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.290
Then I attach the hook to the rail.

246
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:12.380
After this, the coaster's speed
and power will take the head right off.

247
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.840
As a gymnast, doing all of this while
on the coaster is entirely plausible!

248
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.260
This is crazy!
What proof do you have?

249
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.720
What happened to your necklace?

250
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.310
The pearl necklace you were wearing
before you got on the ride.

251
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.270
Is this not it?

252
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.270
Your tears served as another clue.

253
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.350
You knew beforehand that
the victim was going to die.

254
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.400
Which is why you silently
wept before doing him in.

255
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.370
The trails of tears that go
horizontally across your face...

256
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.880
The only way your tears could
have flowed horizontally

257
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.580
was if you were crying
while on the coaster.

258
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.270
It was his fault, I tell you!

259
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.720
He forsook me!

260
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.730
Hitomi, you were going
out with Kishida-kun?

261
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.060
That's right! Long before
I met you two in college!

262
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.220
So that's why I decided to kill him...

263
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:27.000
...where we had our very first date,
using the necklace he gave me!

264
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.640
Come on, don't cry!

265
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.060
You aren't affected one bit, are you?!

266
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.060
I'm used to crime scenes now.
You know, torn up bodies and stuff...

267
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.960
That's horrible!

268
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.580
It's best to forget about
it as soon as possible.

269
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.230
These sorta things happen
all the time, you know!

270
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.630
They do not!

271
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.890
Huh? It's one of the men in black
from the roller coaster...

272
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.890
Sorry, Ran! You go on ahead!

273
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.390
Wait!

274
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.610
I'll catch up with you!

275
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.570
He's leaving!

276
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.820
I'm not sure why, but I could
just tell somehow...

277
00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:00.850
I got the horrible feeling that
I'd never see Shinichi again...

278
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.480
Sorry for the wait,
Company Director.

279
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.850
You're late! I've been
waiting for two hours!

280
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.520
I came alone,
just as I promised!

281
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.230
I know. I rode the roller coaster
and checked from above.

282
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.400
Just hurry and give it to me!

283
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.120
Don't get ahead of yourself!
The money comes first!

284
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.240
Here! I take it you have
no objections?!

285
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.200
Whoa! There's at least
100 million in there!

286
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.560
This concludes our transaction.

287
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.020
Hurry and give me the film!

288
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.440
The incriminating film that shows
your company smuggling weapons?

289
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.480
Here.

290
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.480
This is all of the film, right?!

291
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.540
Of course.

292
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.650
Who in the world are these people?

293
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.270
That's enough of your little
detective game.

294
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.900
It was just our luck, having this
punk kid follow us around...

295
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.360
Isn't he that detective, boss?!
Want me to take care of him?!

296
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.020
No. The place is still
crawlin' with cops.

297
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.780
We'll use this.
Our organization's latest poison.

298
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.790
It won't even show up in autopsies.

299
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.440
It hasn't been tested on humans yet,
but let's consider this a trial run.

300
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.210
So long, Detective.

301
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.140
M-My body's burning up!

302
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.850
It's like my bones are melting!

303
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.780
I can't hold on!

304
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.820
Hey! There's a dead body over here!

305
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.070
What?!

306
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.510
Guess I really did die...

307
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.490
No, he's still breathing!

308
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.510
Call an ambulance!

309
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.780
I'm alive?!

310
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.360
Ah! That poison must
not work on humans!

311
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.930
Stay with me now!

312
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.820
Can you stand up, little boy?

313
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.240
Little boy?!

314
00:24:04.304 --> 00:24:05.854
I shrunk?!

315
00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:08.024
Why?!

316
00:24:08.674 --> 00:24:10.214
M-My name's Shin-

317
00:24:10.214 --> 00:24:12.134
Err...

318
00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:14.594
Um... Conan!

319
00:24:14.594 --> 00:24:16.454
My name's Conan Edogawa!

320
00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:17.744
Where are you going, Conan-kun?!

321
00:24:19.554 --> 00:24:20.244
Ran!

322
00:24:24.214 --> 00:24:25.884
On the next Conan--

323
00:24:25.884 --> 00:24:29.304
The Kidnapping of the Company
President's Daughter!

324
00:24:45.714 --> 00:24:47.764
Next Conan's Hint:

325
00:24:47.764 --> 00:24:49.124
Skyscraper.
