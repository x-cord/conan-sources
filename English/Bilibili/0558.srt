1
00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:06.241
Dr. Agasa and Haibara go to introduce Doc's invention.

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.141
On their way back, Doc's car breaks down

3
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.441
and what's more he loses his wallet

4
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.841
so he can't even get on the bus.

5
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:18.741
Fortunately, they got a lift from a car that happened to pass by.

6
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.041
But there were bullet holes inside

7
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.141
and traces of where blood had been wiped away.

8
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.641
There was also a gun in the glove compartment.

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.441
The people in the car tell them that they are headed for

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.341
the Mouri Detective Agency. Who are these people?

11
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:35.141
I hope they're not from the Black Organization.

12
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.241
After getting Haibara's call...

13
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:41.141
I headed toward the drive-in diner where the four of them were.

14
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:44.041
The suspicious twosome

15
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.941
are Inspector Kansuke Yamato and Officer Yui Uehara

16
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.641
from the Nagano Prefectural Police Department.

17
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.941
Talk about worrying for nothing.

18
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:56.841
But what on earth did the two come here for?

19
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.041
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

20
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.641
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

21
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.841
A new character from Nagano, Inspector Koume.

22
00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.741
Together we'll unravel the mystery of the Red Wall!

23
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.441
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.141
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.941
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:55.251
"Mouri Detective Agency"

27
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:56.551
And?

28
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.751
Did anything happen in Nagano?

29
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.551
You couldn't have come all the way out here

30
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:02.351
just to deliver us the Bota Mochi, right?

31
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:04.251
Oh, the fact is...

32
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.651
We can't solve it, you see...

33
00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:08.651
So, we came to ask you for help.

34
00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:11.651
We can't seem to solve

35
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:14.451
the mystery about the blood smeared "Red Wall."

36
00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:21.151
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Three Favors)"

37
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:31.651
Isn't there a better road to drive on?

38
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.351
After all, I, Kogoro Mouri, the famed detective

39
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:38.951
has come to offer you a hand immediately

40
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.151
regarding the murder case, don't you think?

41
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:45.551
Thanks to you, I didn't get to eat the Bota Mochi either.

42
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.251
I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.051
This road is the shortcut.

44
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:51.951
And? Isn't it about time you tell us

45
00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:55.251
about the mystery of the blood smeared red wall?

46
00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:58.051
Don't tell me that there's a place somewhere in the forest

47
00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:00.051
where the walls are painted red with human blood?

48
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:01.551
No.

49
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:04.351
Although Kan-chan says that that it is smeared with blood,

50
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:07.351
-he actually means... -Hey, stop right there.

51
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:08.951
Kan-chan.

52
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.351
Preconceptions get in the way of deduction.

53
00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:14.451
We went all the way out to Tokyo to pick you up

54
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:17.751
so that you could come to the site and look it over immediately!

55
00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:21.751
And Uehara!

56
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:23.951
I'm your boss!

57
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.751
Don't call me Kan-chan.

58
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.751
Yes, Inspector Kansuke Yamato!

59
00:04:29.751 --> 00:04:34.351
Well, I guess you can at least tell us where we're headed, though.

60
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:37.651
To an old house that is built beyond inside this forest

61
00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:40.451
called the House of Hope.

62
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.251
House of Hope, what a nice name.

63
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:49.151
It was called by that name 20 years ago.

64
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:52.951
Right. Three years ago, a woman,

65
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:54.151
who had died a pitiful death

66
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:57.451
was found in the warehouse of that house.

67
00:04:57.451 --> 00:05:01.351
And since then, I hear that the locals refer to it as...

68
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:03.651
not the House of Hope.

69
00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:06.851
But, rather, the House of Death.

70
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.351
House of Death.

71
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:20.051
Although it's pretty old, it's a fine house.

72
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.451
It seems to have been the villa of some rich person originally.

73
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:25.651
Hey.

74
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:29.451
Isn't it sort of strange that Inspector Yamato

75
00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:32.751
would ask Pops to help him with a case?

76
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:37.551
Oh, that's because someone that he doesn't want to admit defeat to

77
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:40.451
is involved in this case!

78
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:41.851
Which means that

79
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.951
the person he doesn't want to admit defeat to is from the police?

80
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.151
Yes.

81
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:49.551
But that person is not from the Nagano Prefectural Police Headquarters,

82
00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:52.251
he is rather an officer whose jurisdiction is in this area,

83
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:54.751
an officer from the local Arano Police Department.

84
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.051
But if that officer's from the station with jurisdiction over this area,

85
00:05:57.051 --> 00:06:00.351
why would an officer from the headquarters want to do him in?

86
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.151
That person is actually

87
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.351
Kan-chan's classmate since elementary school

88
00:06:05.351 --> 00:06:08.851
and seems to be competing with Kan-chan about everything!

89
00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:13.351
He graduated Tohto University's School of Law with as a top graduate

90
00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:14.951
but didn't take the career test for what he specialized in.

91
00:06:14.951 --> 00:06:18.551
He rather, entered the headquarters as a non-career worker.

92
00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:20.851
He is a slightly queer man who got transferred

93
00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:22.951
to the Arano Police Department after a certain incident.

94
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:26.151
Which means they were originally colleagues

95
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:28.551
-at the Nagano Prefectural Police Department? -Right!

96
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:32.051
And this person's also got a militaristic name like Kan-chan!

97
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.151
Hey, Uehara!

98
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:35.751
We're going in!

99
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.951
Oh, yes, sir!

100
00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:41.551
Come to think of it. The name Kansuke Yamato

101
00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.251
is so much like the name of Shingen Takeda's strategist,

102
00:06:44.251 --> 00:06:45.751
Kansuke Yamamoto.

103
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.251
Anyway,

104
00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:49.251
anytime this person competes with him,

105
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:50.851
Kan-chan seems to get upset

106
00:06:50.851 --> 00:06:53.251
and since he's never experience victory yet,

107
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:55.051
please help him out, okay?

108
00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:59.951
It seems that Kan-chan's really not counting on Detective Mouri,

109
00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:02.851
but, rather, you!

110
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:11.351
I'll tell you why this place was called the House of Hope.

111
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:14.051
A rich man who built this house,

112
00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:17.951
after the house got old and he stopped using it,

113
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:19.451
decided to let talented young people

114
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:21.251
who didn't have money stay here

115
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:25.551
for rent that was almost like free,

116
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.451
until they realized their dreams!

117
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:33.651
Well, and that kindly rich man who used to come visit this house sometimes,

118
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:38.551
soon after finishing procedures to hand this house over to the inhabitants

119
00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:39.951
died of an illness.

120
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:41.351
The people who lived here

121
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.551
went independent two or three years later and left the house too.

122
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:47.251
And since five or six years ago,

123
00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:50.251
only a couple who met and got married at this house

124
00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:52.351
seems to have been living here.

125
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:54.051
Hey, Uehara.

126
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.051
Show them the pictures of the people who used to live here!

127
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:58.251
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:02.751
Here are the six of them.

129
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:10.451
The topmost picture is Illustrator, Mr. Shusaku Akashi.

130
00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:14.951
The next one is, Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, an actor.

131
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:19.351
The next is novelist, Ms. Aoi Kobashi.

132
00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:23.751
Fashion designer, Mr. Shoji Yamabuki.

133
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:28.151
CG creator, Mr. Takuto Momose.

134
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:32.051
And lastly, musician Mr. Shiro Naoki.

135
00:08:33.751 --> 00:08:39.451
The names are all ones that sound familiar and yet not.

136
00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:40.951
By the way,

137
00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:43.951
something's been bothering me from a while ago but...

138
00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:46.651
What is this?

139
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.851
There's what looks to be the mark of colored paper

140
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:51.651
torn off from the door of the room.

141
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:52.751
Come to think of it,

142
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:55.551
there's a similar mark on the door of this room too.

143
00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:57.951
That's probably...

144
00:08:57.951 --> 00:08:59.851
Maybe they were marked by colored paper to tell them apart?

145
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.251
Colored paper?

146
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:06.751
I think that the people used the colored paper to tell the rooms apart!

147
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.751
Because all six people have colors in their names!

148
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.051
Stupid!

149
00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.151
The names are pasted onto the pictures

150
00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:15.251
but none of them have characters that mean color.

151
00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:17.351
It's not the character, but sound of the name!

152
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:18.751
I get it!

153
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:22.151
Mr. Akashi is Red!

154
00:09:22.151 --> 00:09:26.051
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa is Green!

155
00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:27.651
Exactly.

156
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:29.951
Ms. Aoi Kobashi is Blue!

157
00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:32.751
Mr. Shoji Yamabuki is Golden Yellow!

158
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.651
Mr. Takuto Momose is Peach color!

159
00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:38.751
Mr. Shiro Naoki, the color White.

160
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:41.851
See, all six people have colors in their names!

161
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:45.251
Amazing, Conan!

162
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.651
Not only the rooms, but those six

163
00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:52.651
seem to have categorized themselves by color for almost everything.

164
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:53.751
Look!

165
00:09:53.751 --> 00:09:55.751
This came out of the warehouse of this house.

166
00:09:55.751 --> 00:09:58.151
It's an old mealtime chore schedule!

167
00:09:58.151 --> 00:10:02.751
Their names aren't listed but rather, only color.

168
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:08.851
It could be that they were all calling themselves by color.

169
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:10.451
And?

170
00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:13.251
Where's the room where the corpse was found?

171
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:16.551
This way.

172
00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:23.651
What are those cardboard boxes that are stacked up on that cart?

173
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:27.851
There are books inside and it's packed full.

174
00:10:27.851 --> 00:10:29.851
It's really heavy too.

175
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:31.551
The door of this room that swings outwards

176
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:34.551
was blocked by this cart.

177
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.651
So that the person inside

178
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.751
couldn't come out until he died.

179
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:43.151
So, that room is the one in question...

180
00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:44.451
Yeah.

181
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:46.551
When we got here,

182
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:50.451
he was already skinny and starved to death.

183
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:53.551
In this horrible...

184
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.751
room with red walls.

185
00:10:56.751 --> 00:11:00.751
Don't tell me that this is...

186
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:02.051
Human blood?

187
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:04.751
-It's lacquer. -What?

188
00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:09.351
See, the mouth of this lacquer paint spray can on the floor.

189
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:12.451
It's got the same color on it as the one on the wall!

190
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:17.551
But what's with this black and white chair?

191
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:19.151
Paint seems to have deliberately been put on it

192
00:11:19.151 --> 00:11:22.151
and nailed to the floor to fix it in place.

193
00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:25.551
The corpse was sitting on the white chair.

194
00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.351
Don't tell me that

195
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:30.251
it's a message from the killer addressed to somebody?

196
00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:32.851
No, that can't be.

197
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:37.551
In this room. The wiretap is still intact.

198
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.651
Wiretap?

199
00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:42.151
I see.

200
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:43.851
The killer, wiretapped this room

201
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:46.951
and was confirming whether the victim was dead or alive.

202
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:50.351
And came to this room after no noise was heard at all

203
00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:52.551
to confirm whether the victim had really died.

204
00:11:52.551 --> 00:11:55.851
The wiretap would've been retrieved.

205
00:11:55.851 --> 00:11:58.751
But since it's still here...

206
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.651
Yeah. The killer left the victim locked in here

207
00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:04.151
and never came here.

208
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:09.751
In other words, the red wall and black and white chair are without doubt...

209
00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:14.351
what the victim left behind as a dying message!

210
00:12:29.473 --> 00:12:34.173
How about it? Did you figure it out?

211
00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:37.673
It's so easy there's nothing to figure out. The message is red!

212
00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:42.073
In other words, the color red is in the name.

213
00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:44.673
Akashi, I think?

214
00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:46.573
I hate to say this,

215
00:12:46.573 --> 00:12:49.773
but the one who was found starved in this room

216
00:12:49.773 --> 00:12:52.973
was that man, Shusaku Akashi!

217
00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:59.573
By the way, Aoi Kobashi who was married to Shusaku Akashi

218
00:12:59.573 --> 00:13:02.073
had the surname Akashi too but...

219
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.873
She died three years ago in the warehouse here.

220
00:13:05.873 --> 00:13:09.373
Don't tell me that the person called Aoi was also killed?

221
00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:13.073
No, she had a bad heart condition to begin with.

222
00:13:13.073 --> 00:13:16.673
She had an attack while looking for something in the warehouse,

223
00:13:16.673 --> 00:13:18.073
and died.

224
00:13:18.073 --> 00:13:20.573
Her husband was in this room

225
00:13:20.573 --> 00:13:24.073
creating a piece of work at that time.

226
00:13:24.073 --> 00:13:26.973
It seems that he only realized that she was lying dead

227
00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.473
after half a day had passed.

228
00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:32.173
Oh no.

229
00:13:32.173 --> 00:13:36.073
If so, it's not the color red in this name.

230
00:13:36.073 --> 00:13:39.573
Red. Red hot...

231
00:13:39.573 --> 00:13:41.873
I see!

232
00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:43.673
Red hot story, maybe?

233
00:13:43.673 --> 00:13:46.473
I didn't go all the way to Tokyo

234
00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:49.073
to pick you up to hear something like that from you!

235
00:13:49.073 --> 00:13:51.673
Attempting to meet a worthy man

236
00:13:51.673 --> 00:13:54.573
without taking the proper course

237
00:13:54.573 --> 00:13:57.473
is as if inviting him to come

238
00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:01.073
yet barring the gate against him.

239
00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:02.673
I see.

240
00:14:02.673 --> 00:14:06.073
You didn't call the renowned detective by phone and summon him

241
00:14:06.073 --> 00:14:09.773
but rather, went to pick him up. Up to there, it's acceptable.

242
00:14:09.773 --> 00:14:14.073
But, what you just said to Detective Mouri

243
00:14:14.073 --> 00:14:16.473
is utterly rude.

244
00:14:16.473 --> 00:14:22.273
As an old friend of yours, I'm ashamed, Kansuke.

245
00:14:22.273 --> 00:14:24.273
Why the heck are you here?

246
00:14:24.273 --> 00:14:26.273
Local police stay out of this, you!

247
00:14:26.273 --> 00:14:30.173
No, this is the jurisdiction of the Arano Police Department.

248
00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:32.573
I can't possibly stay out of this.

249
00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:34.273
Stop your far-fetched argument!

250
00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:36.373
-Just plain logic. -What was that

251
00:14:36.373 --> 00:14:40.073
about being relieved being covered with hair?

252
00:14:40.073 --> 00:14:42.673
It's not covered with hair.

253
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.273
Those are the words of Gentoku Ryubei

254
00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:48.773
who appears in the story of the Three Kingdoms who went out of his way

255
00:14:48.773 --> 00:14:52.173
to pick up a wise strategist to invite him over!

256
00:14:52.173 --> 00:14:53.773
Attempting to meet a worthy man

257
00:14:53.773 --> 00:14:55.673
without taking the proper course

258
00:14:55.673 --> 00:14:57.373
is as if inviting him to come

259
00:14:57.373 --> 00:15:00.073
yet barring the gate against him.

260
00:15:00.073 --> 00:15:01.673
In other words,

261
00:15:01.673 --> 00:15:06.673
doing something improper as to summon a great wise man,

262
00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:08.173
is like closing the gate to the wise man

263
00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:11.273
despite asking him to come. This is what it means!

264
00:15:11.273 --> 00:15:16.173
So, saying, Ryubei visited that man three times!

265
00:15:16.173 --> 00:15:19.573
You knew nothing about Fuurinkazan,

266
00:15:19.573 --> 00:15:22.473
and yet why do you know so much about the Three Kingdoms?

267
00:15:22.473 --> 00:15:24.973
Who cares.

268
00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:26.573
Anyway,

269
00:15:26.573 --> 00:15:29.373
the unsolved mystery left in this room

270
00:15:29.373 --> 00:15:34.473
are not only this red walls and the black and white chair.

271
00:15:34.473 --> 00:15:38.073
That paneled boarded window has been cracked from inside.

272
00:15:38.073 --> 00:15:41.473
And from that hole that had been opened, paint and lacquer,

273
00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:44.873
anything that is used to paint color has all been thrown out.

274
00:15:44.873 --> 00:15:47.273
The only thing left in this room

275
00:15:47.273 --> 00:15:51.073
was this red colored spray

276
00:15:51.073 --> 00:15:54.173
and the signature of the victim,

277
00:15:54.173 --> 00:15:56.773
who bit off his own finger to write it

278
00:15:56.773 --> 00:16:00.073
at the edge of the red colored wall.

279
00:16:00.873 --> 00:16:03.273
Taking all these things into consideration, it is only proper

280
00:16:03.273 --> 00:16:06.373
to ask the renowned detective once again of what he thinks.

281
00:16:06.373 --> 00:16:10.973
Ryubei. Strategist. Three times?

282
00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:15.673
Of course I will stand witness here.

283
00:16:15.673 --> 00:16:17.873
After all, the fact that I thought that

284
00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:19.473
there was something strange

285
00:16:19.473 --> 00:16:21.873
about the large amount of paint that was scattered outside the house

286
00:16:21.873 --> 00:16:24.773
was what lead to the discovery of the corpse.

287
00:16:25.573 --> 00:16:28.373
Hey, don't tell me that the strategist is the famous...

288
00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:31.873
Yes, the one who is always holding the feather fan.

289
00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:34.473
You maybe from the prefectural headquarters,

290
00:16:34.473 --> 00:16:37.673
but you can't possibly keep me out of this.

291
00:16:37.673 --> 00:16:40.173
If I remember correctly, his name is...

292
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.773
Okay, I got it!

293
00:16:42.773 --> 00:16:45.973
Stay as close as you want to your heart's content!

294
00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:47.873
Shokatsuryo...

295
00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.573
-Koume! -Koume?

296
00:16:54.573 --> 00:16:57.673
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:57.673 --> 00:17:01.373
My name is Takaaki Morofushi.

298
00:17:01.373 --> 00:17:05.273
But, my nickname is read, Koume.

299
00:17:05.273 --> 00:17:08.773
So, please call me that way from now on.

300
00:17:08.773 --> 00:17:11.073
I see.

301
00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:13.973
Instead of Koume Shokatsuryo...

302
00:17:13.973 --> 00:17:17.473
He's local (Shokatsu) officer Koume.

303
00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:25.973
And, how about it, Sleeping Kogoro?

304
00:17:25.973 --> 00:17:29.173
This wall that is sprayed red with paint.

305
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:33.973
The signature that the victim wrote in blood on the edge of the wall!

306
00:17:33.973 --> 00:17:36.173
The paneled window is cracked,

307
00:17:36.173 --> 00:17:40.073
and from that hole painting tools are thrown out the window!

308
00:17:40.073 --> 00:17:42.773
And, these two chairs painted black and white

309
00:17:42.773 --> 00:17:46.673
that are nailed in place to the floor!

310
00:17:46.673 --> 00:17:50.173
A guy that was confined to a room like this and starved to death.

311
00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:54.873
Do you know what this man was trying to relay?

312
00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:57.473
Do I know?

313
00:17:57.473 --> 00:18:00.573
Even with the intelligence of a famous detective,

314
00:18:00.573 --> 00:18:03.273
this mystery I see is difficult to solve.

315
00:18:03.273 --> 00:18:06.073
Red, white and black.

316
00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:10.973
He wanted to relay something using these three colors, right?

317
00:18:10.973 --> 00:18:14.873
Because all the other colors were thrown out of the window.

318
00:18:14.873 --> 00:18:17.673
Oh, who is this boy?

319
00:18:17.673 --> 00:18:21.573
He's a kid that's staying with Sleeping Kogoro,

320
00:18:21.573 --> 00:18:24.373
whose name is Conan Edogawa.

321
00:18:24.373 --> 00:18:25.873
Conan Edogawa.

322
00:18:25.873 --> 00:18:28.373
And...

323
00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:31.173
The cardboard boxes that were stacked on the cart

324
00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:34.373
that was blocking the door of the room from opening.

325
00:18:34.373 --> 00:18:36.673
There seems to have been books inside them,

326
00:18:36.673 --> 00:18:38.373
but whose books were they?

327
00:18:38.373 --> 00:18:40.473
Aoi's books!

328
00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.673
Like I just mentioned.

329
00:18:42.673 --> 00:18:44.973
She's the wife of Mr. Shusaku Akashi

330
00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:47.573
who was found starved to death in this room,

331
00:18:47.573 --> 00:18:51.073
and the one who was found dead in the warehouse here of an illness,

332
00:18:51.073 --> 00:18:53.473
maiden name, Ms. Aoi Kobashi.

333
00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:57.373
A large amount of books from the bookshelf in her room were removed,

334
00:18:57.373 --> 00:19:00.573
and were packed in those cardboard boxes.

335
00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:03.873
She had a lot of books.

336
00:19:03.873 --> 00:19:06.673
And, she herself was also a novelist.

337
00:19:06.673 --> 00:19:10.373
Then, it could've been the doing of one of Aoi's family members

338
00:19:10.373 --> 00:19:12.573
who wanted to avenge her death.

339
00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:16.273
Because despite Aoi collapsing of a heart attack,

340
00:19:16.273 --> 00:19:18.073
Shusaku kept on drawing

341
00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:20.873
and didn't realize what had happened until half a day later.

342
00:19:20.873 --> 00:19:23.373
But, what family member...

343
00:19:23.373 --> 00:19:25.273
She was an only child,

344
00:19:25.273 --> 00:19:27.573
and her parents had died when she was still young.

345
00:19:27.573 --> 00:19:32.173
Then, maybe the four men who used to live here

346
00:19:32.173 --> 00:19:34.873
with her in the past are to be suspected?

347
00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:36.973
Huh? Why?

348
00:19:36.973 --> 00:19:40.773
Because unless the culprit knew that there were many books in Aoi's room

349
00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:43.973
as well as the fact that the door swings open outwardly,

350
00:19:43.973 --> 00:19:46.373
the culprint wouldn't think of

351
00:19:46.373 --> 00:19:49.973
placing a cart filled with books to block the door.

352
00:19:49.973 --> 00:19:51.873
In other words, it is highly likely that

353
00:19:51.873 --> 00:19:54.473
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa the actor,

354
00:19:54.473 --> 00:19:57.773
Mr. Shoji Yamabuki, the fashion designer.

355
00:19:57.773 --> 00:20:00.873
CG creator Mr. Takuto Momose

356
00:20:00.873 --> 00:20:03.973
or the musician Mr. Shiro Naoki

357
00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:06.973
is the culprit.

358
00:20:10.073 --> 00:20:13.373
That's the picture, right? Pops!

359
00:20:13.373 --> 00:20:16.573
Yeah.

360
00:20:19.573 --> 00:20:24.173
I see. You see things more or less as we do until here.

361
00:20:24.173 --> 00:20:28.173
But, you deliberately didn't remark on it

362
00:20:28.173 --> 00:20:30.273
because you figured that such a simple deduction

363
00:20:30.273 --> 00:20:33.573
-was not even worth mentioning? -Yes.

364
00:20:33.573 --> 00:20:36.773
What? Are you serious?

365
00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:41.173
Yeah, okay, I'll go check things out for myself then!

366
00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.873
What's the matter, Kan-chan?

367
00:20:42.873 --> 00:20:45.773
I mean, Inspector Yamato.

368
00:20:45.773 --> 00:20:47.773
What's the matter, my foot!

369
00:20:47.773 --> 00:20:49.273
I was lead to believe that the fingerprints found on the door knob

370
00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:51.273
on the inside of the room

371
00:20:51.273 --> 00:20:54.473
and the prints on the red spray

372
00:20:54.473 --> 00:20:58.473
were that of the victim, Mr. Akashi but...

373
00:20:58.473 --> 00:21:00.573
The prints found were actually yours, Koume

374
00:21:00.573 --> 00:21:06.273
and that of your fellow police officer!

375
00:21:09.373 --> 00:21:11.973
I'm going to call that officer over to headquarters right now

376
00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:14.073
and squeeze info out of him, but...

377
00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:18.273
Well, I wish you wouldn't get to hard on him.

378
00:21:18.273 --> 00:21:21.373
After all, he's still a green-horn officer,

379
00:21:21.373 --> 00:21:24.573
I'm sure he got upset over seeing his first dead body

380
00:21:24.573 --> 00:21:26.473
at the scene experience,

381
00:21:26.473 --> 00:21:28.873
and inadvertently touched something.

382
00:21:28.873 --> 00:21:33.873
So, you and the green-horn officer found the corpse together?

383
00:21:33.873 --> 00:21:38.573
Yes. I asked him to come to this house in the car on our way back

384
00:21:38.573 --> 00:21:43.273
from another incident we going around asking questions about.

385
00:21:43.273 --> 00:21:45.473
Because I wanted to offer flowers

386
00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:48.073
and place them in front of the warehouse here.

387
00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:50.773
Flowers?

388
00:21:50.773 --> 00:21:52.873
Oh, I forgot to mention it,

389
00:21:52.873 --> 00:21:55.873
but Inspector Morofushi and Inspector Yamato

390
00:21:55.873 --> 00:22:00.073
were classmates with Aoi who died in this warehouse three years ago.

391
00:22:00.073 --> 00:22:02.573
-Class... -Classmates?

392
00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:05.973
Inspector Morofushi was classmates with Ms. Aoi Kobashi

393
00:22:05.973 --> 00:22:09.573
who passed away in the warehouse of this house three years ago?

394
00:22:09.573 --> 00:22:12.073
Is it just a coincidence that the same inspector turns out

395
00:22:12.073 --> 00:22:16.473
to be the one to first discover the corpse of Mr. Shusaku Akashi?

396
00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:20.773
The dying message that Mr. Akashi left behind.

397
00:22:20.773 --> 00:22:24.173
The walls that were painted red with lacquer spray

398
00:22:24.173 --> 00:22:29.073
and the two chairs painted black and white that are nailed to the floor.

399
00:22:29.073 --> 00:22:32.773
What did Mr. Akashi want to relay using all this?

400
00:22:32.773 --> 00:22:34.673
The mystery of the red wall.

401
00:22:34.673 --> 00:22:38.473
The culprit who starved Mr. Akashi to death.

402
00:22:38.473 --> 00:22:41.673
I'm going to get him no matter what!

403
00:24:04.373 --> 00:24:07.873
It's indeed like bamboo shoots in the snow.

404
00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:10.473
There was! A quite suspicious person!

405
00:24:10.473 --> 00:24:14.273
What kind of person was Aoi?

406
00:24:14.273 --> 00:24:17.773
Again. The red wall.

407
00:24:17.773 --> 00:24:21.073
"Move as swift as a wind", is it?

408
00:24:21.073 --> 00:24:24.973
We got an important person who held the key to solving the case...

409
00:24:24.973 --> 00:24:28.273
and we've had him murdered under our own watch!

410
00:24:28.273 --> 00:24:29.573
Next Conan,

411
00:24:29.573 --> 00:24:33.555
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Mercy)"

412
00:24:49.392 --> 00:24:51.692
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:51.692 --> 00:24:53.392
"Chess"

414
00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:56.592
They've come all the way from Nagano in want of my deduction.

415
00:24:56.592 --> 00:24:58.580
He's really a happy-go-lucky man.
