1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,276
Always keep your pokerface...

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,948
Taking my father's teaching to heart...

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,450
The miracle magician glides amidst the skycraper.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:07,452
The miracle magician glides amidst the skycraper.
Here I come, Kid the Phantom Thief!

5
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,104
Here I come, Kid the Phantom Thief!

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,204
Today's target is Golden Eye.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,660
Now, it's showtime!

8
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,056
The Reminiscent Golden Eye.

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,650
There he is!

10
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,480
That's him!

11
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,290
Found the Kid!

12
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,550
Alright, helicopters one, two, and three!

13
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,220
After him! Don't let him get away!

14
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,790
Let's see...

15
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,360
How should I take care of these three crows tailing me?

16
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,070
…What an amateur

17
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,340
I heard you were the greatest thief in Japan.

18
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,800
What a let down…

19
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,440
That unreasonably gaudy outfit, almost as if you want to be caught…

20
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,780
Are you playing at being my country's great thief, Arsene Lupin?

21
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,180
Is this guy French or something?

22
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,680
I'll admit...

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
It was impressive the way you stole the bejeweled sword

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,050
from the heavily guarded museum.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,820
But I could have done it in half the time

26
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,960
He's also a thief!?

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
What!?

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,530
There's another one?

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,230
A cat!?

30
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,070
My name is Chat Noire.

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,470
I look forward to defeating you this coming Sunday
at 9:00 p.m. at Hotel Ocean.

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,310
A bientot!

33
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,550
H, hey, wait!

34
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,520
The French thief, Chat Noire,

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,560
challenges Kid the Phantom Thief through a written warning!

36
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,030
He's after the jewel that graded the ring finger of Marie Antoinette,

37
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,200
The Golden Eye!

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,800
Will The Kid answer this challenge and show up?

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,540
Give that back!

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
I was reading that!

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,740
After Inspector Nakamori successfully retrieved
the bejeweled sword from him,

42
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,280
The Kid made his getaway…

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,350
causing his approval rating to drop, it says!

44
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,980
I don't care…

45
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,280
It wasn't the jewel I was after.

46
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,820
Do you think he'll come, that cowardly Kid?

47
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,590
A ring…

48
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,730
I bet you that's a big one to steal too.

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,860
He's got to accept a challenge

50
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,760
But even if he did, he's just going to lose!

51
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,230
Hey now, you're Japanese, you should support The Kid.

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,940
Silly, it's the police that are going to win…my father!!

53
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,310
Oh…that's what you meant…

54
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,130
Bonjour!

55
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,960
Bonjour, Mr. Hakuba!

56
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,380
Oh, so this is it?

57
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,550
A single line of white inside an orb of gold…

58
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,250
It's name is perfectly suited for it,

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,120
Isn't it, Mr. Dan Mitsuishi!

60
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,160
Yes.

61
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,990
It's the last of the seven accessories Marie Antoinette

62
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,060
collected to ward off evil spirits.

63
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,460
The last?

64
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,200
The other six have all been stolen by the Chat Noire.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,700
And always right after a purchaser was found.

66
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,010
Then why don't you keep it in a safe in your
nation's palatial residence.

67
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,410
Why are you displaying it in this hotel?

68
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,480
It's all a trap set for Chat Noire.

69
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,920
A trap?

70
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,120
To be honest,

71
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,960
I don't trust any other security systems other than our own.

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,060
What did you say!?

73
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,560
How can I put trust in you,

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,000
when you can't even catch a petty thief like
Kid the Phantom Thief?

75
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,370
Impossible.

76
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,540
Don't look down on the Japanese police!

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,110
If we were in charge,

78
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,910
we wouldn't let a single outsider into this hotel…

79
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,710
Father,

80
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,980
I brought lunch!

81
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,450
What about these outsiders?

82
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,920
They're…

83
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,190
My daughter Aoko and her classmate, Kaito Kuroba.

84
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,020
Hmm, well anyway.

85
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,460
We have prepared for your weak security.

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,760
What do you mean?

87
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,830
Rat traps are useless without an open door for them to come through.

88
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,960
Rat trap?

89
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,200
Do you mean…

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,670
You're planning on capturing The Kid and Chat Noire?!

91
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,670
Maybe you should watch this...

92
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,680
What is it?

93
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,190
This special made glass contains a titan alloy wire.

94
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,190
They can withstand up to ten tons of impact…

95
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,990
Moreover, at the warning time, 9:05 p.m.,

96
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,930
the elevators will all stop on the top floor,

97
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,700
and the stairs will also be closed.

98
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,570
In other words, escape will be impossible after 9:00 p.m.

99
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,540
Their hang gliders and paragliders will be rendered completely useless!

100
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Wow, that's amazing…

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
Yeah…

102
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,980
Easy come, not so easy go, I guess…

103
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,550
But...

104
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,180
If the case containing the ring is this flimsy…

105
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:29,090
I'm protecting the ring with my most trusted alarm device.

106
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,190
Where is it then?

107
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,930
You, Inspector Nakamori.

108
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,900
Huh?

109
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,670
You're going to wear that ring yourself,

110
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,900
and wait for them to come, over that case.

111
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,740
Me??!

112
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,370
As long as you keep your hand in a fist the whole time,

113
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,780
it won't be stolen.

114
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,010
Wait, are you serious…?

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,310
In case of the off chance,

116
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,720
that you're sleep gassed, or bodily taken away,

117
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,620
I'll equip you with a gas mask and a tracking device.

118
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,190
I see, that's a great idea!

119
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,530
The only way to steal the ring would be to cut my finger off.

120
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,230
Uh, what if they cut your finger off!?

121
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,400
Don't be ridiculous!

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,100
The Kid would never do anything that barbaric…

123
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,370
But he…

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Chat Noire might.

125
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,110
Ouch…

126
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,470
Who are you!?

127
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,640
This is the insurance inspector from an American company,

128
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,210
Ruby Jones.

129
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,850
Insurance company?

130
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,480
Yes.

131
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,220
They've taken on all the theft insurance

132
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,790
of the jewels owned by Mr. Dan MItsuishi,

133
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,560
and when I told her The Kid was a master of disguise…

134
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,690
She checked your face…

135
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,290
Yes. To make sure.

136
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,000
I was born and raised in Texas, and that's how I do things.

137
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,870
Don't think badly of me…

138
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,070
But, you didn't have to…

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,470
They were under suspicion.

140
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,610
Things just kept getting stolen so much,

141
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,380
the company thinks you might be in cahoots with Chat Noire.

142
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,880
How could they!?

143
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,350
If the Golden Eye were to be stolen,

144
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,920
the company would take a major hit.

145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,190
They sent me here as a last resort to protect it.

146
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,760
Leave it to us, the police…!

147
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,420
Under estimating the Chat Noire can be very dangerous.

148
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,790
You know what happened to Mrs. Mitsuishi,

149
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,230
who wore a hair accessory containing the Cat's Eye…

150
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,230
Chat Noire chopped off the hair with the accessory in it,

151
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,240
and took it all away…

152
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,440
Then, is my finger also going to…

153
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,270
I won't let him get away!

154
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,350
I'll catch that stray cat and cut off its breath…

155
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,450
And really show him!

156
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,950
If you're worried, try wearing a glove with the ring.

157
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,990
It might help settle your nerves.

158
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,900
That woman, thinking it's not her problem.

159
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,030
I mean, is this plan...

160
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,400
even going to work?

161
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,100
You said yourself just now that it was a great idea.

162
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,010
Ahh, this thing is getting in my way!

163
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,480
You should put this ring through your shirt button…

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,880
It hangs off because you don't hook it through the button like this.

165
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,050
Oh, thanks, Kaito.

166
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,950
But those names, Mitsuishi, Ruby,

167
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,490
their names all sound like jewels

168
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,920
Hey!

169
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,990
My name comes from sapphire blue too, doesn't it!?

170
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,300
Actually…

171
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,130
So you were named after your birthstone too, Ruby…?

172
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,340
Oh, our birthdays are close,

173
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,570
we should be friends,

174
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,570
Uh, yes…

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,380
Then, is your boyfriend born in December?

176
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,850
No, Kaito's birthday is in June.

177
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,610
Oh…that's right

178
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,750
That's what she said.

179
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,790
Father, you weren't listening to me, were you!

180
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,790
This doesn't feel exactly fair…

181
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,200
But a challenge is a challenge…

182
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,900
From abroad?

183
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,240
Hello?

184
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,140
Hey, you alive?

185
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,810
That rude, arrogant tone can only be…!?

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,750
Well, Spider's over here, so I guess you're safe.

187
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,250
Hakuba!?

188
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,950
Everyone's talking about it here in Paris,

189
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,390
the French thief, Chat Noire, is challenging you in Japan.

190
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,550
What!?

191
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,660
Not me, The Kid…

192
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,230
What did you say just now?

193
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,560
Spider's over there!?

194
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,260
So you are interested?

195
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,700
…Of course you are.

196
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,110
The greatest assassin in the world is after you,
Kid the Phantom Thief!

197
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,070
…What are you talking about?

198
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,440
So you don't care?

199
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,550
if I get Spider while you're playing dumb?

200
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,580
Well…

201
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,420
You don't need to worry.

202
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,450
I won't get him until I know,

203
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,420
beyond a shadow of a doubt, what his identity is.

204
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,490
I'm telling you! I'm not The Kid!

205
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,760
Well, anyway.

206
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,930
Since I've got you on the phone,

207
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,260
I'll share with you some information I have on Chat Noire.

208
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,970
According to a friend in the Parisian Police,

209
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,710
lately he's only been stealing from Mitsuishi's Antoinette collection.

210
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,010
The collection was inherited from Dan's father, Ken Mitsuishi,

211
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,550
and his son took them out of storage after 30 years.

212
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,180
And instead of a leaving his name,

213
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,750
Chat Noire always leaves a replica accessory at the scene of the crime,

214
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,960
an item exactly like the item he steals from the Antoinette collection…

215
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,800
Almost as if it were taken from the same mold.

216
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,830
Same mold…

217
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,730
That's about all I've got…

218
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,170
Do your best…

219
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,840
Looks like it's almost show time.

220
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Excuse me.

221
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Is that…?

222
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,250
Well, anyway, guess it's time to begin.

223
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,060
Yeah, Jii?

224
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,100
You were saying you wanted to go to the Opera House, right?

225
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,370
Kaito! Where are you?

226
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,170
Aoko!

227
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,540
Kaito said, can you give this to Jii.

228
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,270
Huh?

229
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,370
Did Kaito leave!?

230
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,410
What! He was the one that said we should bring
my father lunch!

231
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,010
Sorry, Aoko…

232
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,920
I just can't lose this one.

233
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,960
It's a showdown, kid!

234
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,860
Alright then, Inspector Nakamori.

235
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,730
Don't let him find your tracking device.

236
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,190
Uh, yeah…

237
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,400
Calm down.

238
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,430
I know what I said before, but he won't find it easy to steal.

239
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,970
I really shouldn't have said I'd do this.

240
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,610
Wh…what was that? I felt a gaze…!?

241
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,840
How will you play this now, Kid?

242
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,150
Because I'm all ready!

243
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,810
Currently 8:55 p.m.

244
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,320
What is the situation?

245
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,120
Everything is going according to plan.

246
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,760
The four elevators are all stopped at the top floor.

247
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,690
The entrance from the roof to the stairs is also closed!

248
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
Are you sure that's safe?

249
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,260
Taking the police helicopters off the job?

250
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,670
I thought I told you.

251
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,840
With these special glass windows, nobody can break in, or break out.

252
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Helicopters will only get in the way.

253
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,070
Hey, what are those!?

254
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,540
Light projectors!

255
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,710
It's dark in here, I thought it should be well lit…

256
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,910
On who's orders?

257
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,180
The Inspector.

258
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,480
Inspector Nakamori gave the orders just now over the wireless…

259
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,250
Huh?

260
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,320
Hey wait a second, I didn't…

261
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,020
We don't have time! Turn them on!
Hey wait a second, I didn't…

262
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,120
We don't have time! Turn them on!

263
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,620
Fools! If you turn them on all at once…

264
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,460
Uh oh!

265
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,200
I told you!

266
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,330
Back up generators will immediately turn the lights back on

267
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,600
I should welcome them.

268
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,840
The petty thieves who walked right into my trap!

269
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,510
Inspector, your gas mask…

270
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,770
Uh, yeah…

271
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,380
Don't ever open your fist with the ring on it!

272
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,350
But if it's this dark…

273
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,110
Ohh, thanks.

274
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,820
Kid The Phantom Thief!?

275
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,950
Protect the Inspector!

276
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,290
Uh! Fools!

277
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,160
Let me go! That's my face!

278
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,730
I've been waiting, Kid the Phantom Thief.

279
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,590
For just this moment!

280
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,960
Hey! Let me go!

281
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,330
The ring!

282
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,040
Is the ring still there!?

283
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,170
Yeah, it's fine.

284
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,870
I was holding onto it tightly.

285
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,740
See!

286
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,510
Inspector, the jewel!!

287
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,240
Huh?

288
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,510
It's...It's gone!?

289
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,250
Look!

290
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,220
It's The Kid!

291
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,050
I thought it was impossible to escape this place!

292
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,090
Hmph, you underestimated him.

293
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,420
Unlike the stray cat from France,

294
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,830
The Kid is a thief who makes the impossible, possible.

295
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,730
Exactly!

296
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm going after The Kid right now!

297
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,400
Alright,

298
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,640
So will the police…

299
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,810
Huh?

300
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,880
Wait. Let her go after the dummy.

301
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,980
Dummy?

302
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,480
Oh!

303
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,550
It's not our loss yet.

304
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,120
Because the ring…

305
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,790
Inspector!
Because the ring…

306
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,160
Because the ring…

307
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,690
This man was sleeping in the toilet store room!

308
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,760
Who are you!?

309
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,200
Wh, what!?

310
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,160
Uh…!?

311
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,300
You acted like you were on top of everything,

312
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,800
and you were The Kid in disguise all along!

313
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,000
No…!?

314
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,740
Get him!

315
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,940
Uh…s, stop…

316
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,120
The elevator itself is covered in the special glass.

317
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,760
But when you get down to it, it's just thick glass.

318
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,560
S, stop it…!

319
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,760
I'm really…me…!

320
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,660
Medical team, stat…

321
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,570
Huh?

322
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,770
No…!?

323
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,370
Inspector!!

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,670
What!?

325
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,540
Yeah, everything's going according to plan, Jii…

326
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,680
They fell for it hook line and sinker,

327
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,050
and all I did was stick a dummy piece on the back.

328
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,620
I'm amazing!

329
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,990
Phone call? From who?

330
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,530
Hello?

331
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Bon soire, Kid the Phantom Thief

332
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,030
Chat Noire!?

333
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,840
If you're still there,

334
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,610
you must be gazing at the ring you stole and enjoying yourself?

335
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,980
Completely unaware that it's a fake.

336
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Fake!?

337
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,150
Of course!

338
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,320
I wouldn't put the real thing on your finger

339
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,820
Then, where's the real one!?

340
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,050
The real one is…

341
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,920
Here, I used the tie pin on your necktie, and...

342
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,660
Wh, what!?

343
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,200
Thanks to you turning out the lights,

344
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,300
I was able to get my hands on the real thing…

345
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,300
I called because I wanted to say thank you.

346
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,280
This was the last item I absolutely needed for my collection.

347
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,750
So that's why you sent a dummy remote control hang glider

348
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,610
and ran out of the exhibition room and pretended to chase me,

349
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,980
and escaped on your paraglider from the room…

350
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,950
Isn't that right?

351
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,490
The so called investigator for the Insurance Company,

352
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,130
Ms. Ruby Jones?

353
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,260
How did you know?

354
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,070
From your birth stone.

355
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,330
Birth stone?

356
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,100
Our birthdays are close.

357
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,810
Ruby and Sapphire…

358
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,110
In France they're the March and April birthstones,

359
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,280
so your birthdays would be close,

360
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,610
but in America and Japan,

361
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,380
they're the July and September birthstones…

362
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,320
that's when I realized that you must be

363
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,850
a French woman posing as an American.

364
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,360
Oh…so you heard?

365
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,260
Also…

366
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,430
In France, they say the malachite is the December birthstone…

367
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,330
Yes…I'm impressed.

368
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,900
One more thing.

369
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,170
I realized you're a pitiful thief,

370
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,800
who's stealing back your parents' relics.

371
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,240
The collection that was sealed 30 years ago,

372
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,080
the replicas left at the scene of the crime made from the same mold,

373
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,050
your almost mourning like costume.

374
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,310
It was all quite easy to surmise.

375
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,320
Yes…

376
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,960
The Antoinette Collection is fake,

377
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,460
Dan Mitsuishi's father, Ken Mitsuishi hired my father

378
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,560
to make the collection for his wife…

379
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,270
But because they were such perfect replicas.

380
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,700
He said he was going to announce that they were real,

381
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,970
and to be true to the integrity of his craft,

382
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,740
my father committed suicide in protest,

383
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,140
and Ken was forced to seal the collection.

384
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,380
But...

385
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,650
His stupid son opened the collection back up.

386
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,720
To impress his extravagant wife, for that reason alone.

387
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,790
So I became the Chat Noire, and started taking them back.

388
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,090
These keepsakes of my father…

389
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,830
…what!?

390
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,630
Unfortunately, that's a fake, prepared by me.

391
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,440
So…you knew it was a fake…

392
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,650
You win.

393
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,850
I guess I have to give in on this one.

394
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,350
No…this is an important keepsake of your father's.

395
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,360
I'll return it to you in five seconds.

396
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,160
Oh, you're silly, do you know where I am?

397
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,060
Not even the great escape artist, Houdini, could do that…

398
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,560
Three…two…
Not even the great escape artist, Houdini, could do that…

399
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,660
One!

400
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
How can that be…?

401
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,110
Why did you go through the trouble?

402
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,880
Because the reasons for your crimes are somewhat similar to mine.

403
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,450
They're finally here.

404
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,060
Ouch!!

405
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,460
Kid the Phantom Thief!!

406
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
A hole!?

407
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't let him get away!

408
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,900
Bring the elevator down!

409
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,700
Uh, yes!

410
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,440
Fool! That's no hole…

411
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,000
Bye, bye.

412
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,580
Oops!

413
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,410
You're going to fly again…

414
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,480
In that unreasonably gaudy white outfit…

415
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,350
Yeah…

416
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,020
I don't sneak around in black…

417
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,990
Because I'm the bold and beautiful, Kid the Phantom Thief!

418
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,100
In France, they say the malachite is the December birthstone…

419
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,600
Kaito!?

420
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,540
Kaito's birthday is in June.

421
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,650
Goodbye, Kid the Phantom Thief…

422
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,550
Merci, Kaito Kuroba!

423
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,230
The doors on platform 3 will close.

424
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,900
Please watch out for thieves running onto the train.

425
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,570
Just kidding!

426
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,370
Next week,

427
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,610
I face off with Her Majesty The Queen on a luxury train that runs through the night!

428
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,580
Two and a half hours to the final stop,

429
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,620
the clock is ticking, but the organization has to come and interfere!

430
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,390
Come on now, don't be so barbaric,

431
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,060
Or The Queen of Hearts won't show…!

432
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,656
Next on "Magic Kaito,"
"The Crystal Mother of Tears"!

433
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:33,960
I'll see you under the moonlight.

434
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,660
Next Kid's magic,

435
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,030
"Ice"
