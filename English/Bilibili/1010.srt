00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,930

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,560
A dine and dash in Beika City?

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,530
A popular idol is behaving mysteriously!

6
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,020
Always determining the one truth

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,900
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

8
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,560
his name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,040

Come in.

15
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,170
Excuse me.

16
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,470
Starting today, I transferred from the Haido City
police box to the Beika City police box on 4-chome.

17
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,700
Starting today, I transferred from the Haido City

My name is Yamasato Futoshi.

19
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,080
Officer Yamasato?

20
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,560
There's a case I'd like you to
crack, Detective Mori Kogoro.

21
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,930
Crack a case?

22
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,190
Yes, crack a case.

23
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,150
Our story begins with a
single phone call I received

24
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,200
at the Beika City 4-chome police box today.

25
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,250
Beika Police Station Beika 4-chome Police Box

26
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,700
Beika Police Station Beika 4-chome Police Box
Hello, this is Beika City 4-chome—

27
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,200
What? A dine and dash at a family restaurant?

28
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,490
I'll be right there!

29
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,600
I headed there immediately, but...

30
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,970
What? The dine and dash has been resolved?

31
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,960
Seconds before I arrived,

32
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,000
the blonde girl who dine and dashed
returned with her mother to apologize.

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,230
Seconds before, huh?

34
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,100
We passed by each other.

35
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,290
When I arrived at the restaurant, I encountered
a sobbing blonde girl and her mother,

36
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,240
who was supporting her, in
front of the restaurant.

37
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,440
According to the mother, her daughter
forgot her wallet and panicked.

38
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,050
So it's been solved, then.

39
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,500
Why don't we have a drink to celebrate?

40
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,930
No, thank you. I'm currently on duty.

41
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,510
And besides, the case isn't over yet.

42
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,940
The problem is what the waitstaff said.

43
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,430
They claim the girl who dine and dashed

44
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,520
and the girl who came to apologize seemed
like completely different people.

45
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,020
The girl who dine and dashed was
a blonde wearing sunglasses,

46
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:07,030
but she seemed like a different person from the
girl who just came to apologize with her mother.

47
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,250
What do you mean?

48
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,330
When I brought the chocolate
parfait to her table,

49
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,790
I got a glimpse of her face.

50
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,590
The smile she had then looked just like hers.

51
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,880
It's cold!

52
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,920
Her? You mean...

53
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,970
Apparently her smile looked just
like that of idol Kakurai Kayoko.

54
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,350
Apparently her smile looked just
like that of idol Kakurai Kayoko.

55
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,510
Apparently her smile looked just
like that of idol Kakurai Kayoko.

56
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,890
Kakurai Kayoko?

57
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,850
Actually... there was another similar case.

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,860
It happened three months ago at the police box
in Haido City where I was stationed at the time.

Hello, this is Haido City 5-chome.

63
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,620
What? A dine and dash at a ramen restaurant?

64
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,230
Yes. I'll be right there.

68
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,910
What? The case has been resolved?

69
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,810
According to the owner, as in
today's family restaurant case,

70
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,010
it was a blonde woman in
sunglasses who dine and dashed.

71
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,520
As soon as she finished eating
her ramen, she suddenly ran off.

72
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,810
The owner immediately called it in,

73
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:26,020
but after ten minutes, the blonde and a
woman claiming to be her older sister showed up.

74
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,260
According to the sister, her younger
sister forgot her wallet and panicked.

75
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,280
I see. Those are similar stories.

76
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,780
So, did the owner of the
ramen restaurant also say

77
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,280
that the blonde with sunglasses
looked like Kakurai Kayoko?

78
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,130
No.

79
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,800
What?

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,050
That evening, at the Haido City Hall,
there was a DDPP handshake event.

81
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,050
That evening, at the Haido City Hall,
there was a DDPP handshake event.

Event

82
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,070
That evening, at the Haido City Hall,
there was a DDPP handshake event.

83
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,740
DDPP?

84
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,060
It's the idol group Kakurai
Kayoko belongs to.

85
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,310
Kakurai Kayoko is the star of DDPP.

86
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,280
Kakurai

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,820
Kakurai
Kayoko
Her smile is remarkably cute.

88
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,070
Her popularity alone has exploded.

89
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,580
At the Haido City handshake event, there was a
huge line in front of only Kakurai Kayoko's booth.

90
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,560
But apparently, the other
members thought poorly of her.

91
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,590
On one occasion, they became jealous
of the amount of gifts she received.

92
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,100
On another occasion,

93
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,390
they all ignored Kakurai Kayoko when
she showed up late to a dance lesson.

94
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,900
On yet another occasion,
in the powder room...

95
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,330
Due to that string of incidents, the
smile finally disappeared from her face.

96
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,220
She was taken away in an ambulance.

97
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,990
That night, the blonde in sunglasses dine
and dashed at a ramen restaurant in Haido City.

98
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,710
I didn't get it at the time,

99
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,070
but after what the Beika City family
restaurant waitstaff said today...

100
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,680
The smile of the blonde in
sunglasses who dine and dashed

101
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,710
looked just like Kakurai Kayoko's.

102
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,290
That's when it clicked.

103
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,730
The blonde in sunglasses who dine and dashed

104
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,840
at a Haido City ramen restaurant three months ago

105
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,590
may have been Kakurai Kayoko as well.

106
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,600
After suffering the jealousy of the other
DDPP members, Kakurai Kayoko was distraught.

107
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,020
She awoke in a hospital room and felt hungry.

108
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,030
She looked around the room
and saw her bag there.

109
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,530
Inside her bag were the blonde wig
and sunglasses she wore onstage.

110
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,820
Disguising herself using those,
she left the hospital room

111
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,040
wandered around the city at night,

112
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,840
and eventually dine and dashed
at a ramen restaurant.

113
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,950
and eventually dine and dashed
at a ramen restaurant.

119
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:53,280
Did the distraught and recuperating Kakurai
Kayoko leave the hospital in the countryside,

120
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,610
disguise herself as the blonde in sunglasses,

121
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,940
and dine and dash at a Beika
City family restaurant?

122
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,200
Great Detective Mori Kogoro,
I'd like to ask you again.

123
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,210
Please crack this case!

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
Huh? What? Incredible!

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,600
He's already asleep and solving—no,
masterfully cracking the case while he naps!

126
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,180
What?!

127
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,690
He's just asleep because
he drank too many beers.

128
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,940
I'm home!

129
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
Dad, listen to this.

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,740
Just now, at Beika Park...

131
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,950
Sorry for interrupting.

132
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm currently cracking a case.

133
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,760
Cracking a case?

134
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,940
That's right. I'm cracking a case.

135
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,450
I asked for his help.

136
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,210
I'm Yamasato from the Beika
City 4-chome police box.

137
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,720
Nice to meet you. I'm Mori's daughter Ran.

138
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,010
What case are you solving?

139
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,970
More importantly, Ran, weren't
you about to say something?

140
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,970
Oh, right. I just saw her.

141
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,440
Saw who?

142
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,190
Kakurai Kayoko-chan.

143
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,110
What?!

144
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,020
What?!

You saw Kakurai Kayoko?

147
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,710
Where? Where did you see her?

148
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,040
Where? At Beika Park.

149
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,140
Tell me all about it!

150
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,800
On my way home from school just now,

151
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,700
I was walking through Beika
Park with my friends.

152
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,560
It looked like there was an on-location
shoot for a drama or movie.

153
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,560
We wanted to see who was appearing in it,

154
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,060
so we searched the area.

155
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,770
That's when we found a woman
who looked like an attendant

156
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,570
standing in front of a van.

157
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,830
We were certain someone famous was inside.

158
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:14,450
We snuck behind the van without
being seen by her and looked inside.

159
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,840
Start!

160
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,760
No.

161
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,220
No.

162
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,260
No, no.

163
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,160
I think they were filming
Kakurai Kayoko-chan's first movie

164
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,360
after returning from her hiatus.

165
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,340
How old was Kakurai Kayoko's female manager?

166
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,040
What?

167
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,630
Around 40?

168
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,870
How old was her female attendant?

169
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,050
The woman's age?

170
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,650
Around 20?

171
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,400
That's about the same age as Kakurai Kayoko.

172
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,310
Um, I've got something to
do, so I'm going to go.

173
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,820
It seems the thing I personally
feared the most has happened.

174
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,770
The distraught and recuperating Kakurai Kayoko
should've retired from the entertainment industry.

175
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,590
But her agency—no,

176
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,620
the entertainment industry is
trying to force Kakurai Kayoko

177
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,330
to return when she hasn't recovered yet.

178
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,330
Detective Mori Kogoro.

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,060
What I'm about to tell you
are my personal thoughts.

180
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,240
It's certainly not any
kind of logical deduction.

181
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,050
Please listen.

182
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,120
Kakurai Kayoko came to Beika City in order
to film her first movie after her return.

183
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,600
However, her mental health
had not yet recovered.

184
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,180
Unable to withstand the pressure,

185
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,620
she disguised herself as the blonde in
sunglasses, left the shooting location,

186
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,380
and headed to a family restaurant where she
dine and dashed on a chocolate parfait.

187
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,640
Later, in order to hide the truth,

188
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,660
her female manager and attendant
disguised themselves

189
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,690
as a mother and daughter
and went to pay her bill.

190
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,140
That's just me clumsily thinking aloud.

191
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,500
I'd be delighted if you were
able to use it for future reference.

192
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,650
Now then, Detective Mori Kogoro!
Crack the case, please!

193
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,110
What do you want me to deduce after that?

194
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,410
Crack the case, please!

195
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,680
Does this guy just want to show off his
detective skills to a famous detective?

196
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,840
Crack the case, please!

197
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,410
Yikes.

198
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,310
Crack the case, please!

199
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,920
Okay, okay.

200
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,670
Does this case really need a
detective to crack it, anyway?

201
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,670
I shall crack this case.

202
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,840
Thank you—ow, ow.

203
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,510
I hit my head on your shoes. Ouch...

204
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,900
Shoes?

205
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,520
Conan, get in touch with Ran.

206
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,210
Okay.

207
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,670
What was up with that police officer?

208
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,660
What is it, Dad?

209
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,200
Ran, where did Kakurai Kayoko's tears
fall when you saw her inside the car

210
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,580
at the filming location in Beika Park?

211
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,800
Where were they falling?

212
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,010
On the red shoes she was wearing.

213
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,390
What kind of shoes was her attendant wearing?

214
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,260
Her attendant's shoes?

215
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,770
They were sneakers.

216
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,210
Officer Yamasato, where did the
crying daughter's tears fall

217
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,030
while being held by her
mother at the restaurant?

218
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,530
If they fell on sneakers, then the
daughter was actually the attendant.

219
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,520
If they fell on red shoes,
then it's possible that...

220
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,640
It's possible that...

221
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,340
Red shoes...

222
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,820
What?

223
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,660
What?

224
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,980
Uh, excuse me.

225
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,560
What?

226
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,310
Was it Kakurai Kayoko herself
who went to pay the bill?

227
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,000
The truth is stranger than fiction.

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,590
It's a bit odd for me to say,

229
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,400
but allow to me admit that even I,
the great detective Mori Kogoro,

230
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:47,730
I can hang up now, right?

231
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,870
I can hang up now, right?
am a bit surprised by this conclusion.

232
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,040
am a bit surprised by this conclusion.

233
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,690
The mother and daughter who went
to the Beika City restaurant

234
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,910
to apologize were the manager
and Kakurai Kayoko herself.

235
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,410
Does that mean Kakurai
Kayoko isn't distraught?

236
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,040
Kakurai Kayoko is not distraught.

237
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,890
Three months ago, on the day of the
Haido City ramen restaurant incident,

238
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,130
after suffering the jealousy
of the other DDPP members

239
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,510
and being taken to the hospital,

240
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,140
as you deduced, Kakurai
Kayoko woke up hungry,

241
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,480
took the disguise in her bag
and left the hospital room.

242
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,190
Remember what the manager disguised
as her mother and older sister said.

243
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,340
My daughter forgot her wallet and panicked.

244
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,660
My sister forgot her wallet and panicked.

245
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,950
That was probably the truth.

246
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,700
If that's true, then...

247
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,700
She really did...

248
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,960
...forget her wallet and panic?

249
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,140
Does that mean Kakurai
Kayoko is just an airhead?

250
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,180
It's certainly possible.

251
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,970
Air Head

252
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,130
No...

253
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,100
Kakurai Kayoko...

254
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,860
An airhead?

255
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,110
My Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead!

256
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,500
My Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead,

257
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,800
My Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead,
Officer Yamasato.

258
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,960
Officer Yamasato.
my Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead,

259
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,320
my Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead,

260
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,260
my Kakurai Kayoko isn't an airhead.

261
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,870
I need a drink, too!

262
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,370
You're on duty, Officer Yamasato!

263
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,020
Officer Yamasato, what's wrong with
your Kakurai Kayoko being an airhead?

264
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,930
Officer Yamasato, you underestimate idols.

265
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,390
I've underestimated idols?

266
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,240
Going forward, idols must be strong.

267
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,330
Strong?

268
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,650
Perhaps what Ran saw wasn't
her practicing her smile,

269
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,530
but practicing how not to smile.

270
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,960
No. No!

271
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,540
It's possible.

272
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,170
Kakurai Kayoko is trying
to become a new person.

273
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,520
A new Kakurai Kayoko...

274
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,170
Your Kakurai Kayoko is strong.

275
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,750
She has the strength to withstand the
jealousy of the other DDPP members.

276
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,430
And above all, Kakurai
Kayoko has acting skills.

277
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,140
Kakurai Kayoko's acting skills?

278
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,440
Yeah, right. That's not possible.

279
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,940
Kakurai Kayoko has a cute smile.

280
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,030
Kakurai Kayoko has a cute smile.
Kakurai Kayoko

281
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,440
Kakurai Kayoko
That's all she has.

282
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
She's more than that.

283
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,380
Why did the female manager appear to be her
mother at the Beika City family restaurant?

284
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,580
Why did she appear to be her older sister
at the Haido City ramen restaurant?

285
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,210
Why?

286
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,670
Remember what the waitstaff said.

287
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,090
The girl who dine and dashed
and the girl accompanied

288
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,270
by her mother seemed like
two different people.

289
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,340
That was because of Kakurai Kayoko's acting.

290
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,060
She played a daughter at the
Beika City family restaurant

291
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,470
and a younger sister at the
Haido City ramen restaurant.

292
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,360
What is this if not acting skills?

293
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,890
Kakurai Kayoko

294
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,270
Kakurai Kayoko
Kakurai Kayoko... is an actress?

295
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,200
Yes.

296
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:25,020
Right now, Kakurai Kayoko is attempting
to be reborn as a new Kakurai Kayoko.

297
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,170
Great Detective Mori Kogoro,

298
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,540
you've cracked the case marvelously!

299
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,180
You're on soon.

300
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,460
Okay.

301
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,790
Thank you, Great Detective Mori Kogoro.

302
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,960
Well, goodbye.

303
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,170
By the way, Officer Yamasato, shouldn't you
get back to your duties at the police box?

304
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,050
Oh, my shift ended a long time ago.

305
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,060
Oh, really?

306
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,090
He finally left.

307
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,250
