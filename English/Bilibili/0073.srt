1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.730
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.800
Conan's logic works great on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.550
The JDL's in trouble today!
Wisdom, courage, and teamwork!

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.360
He sees the single truth
for what it is,

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.390
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.020
His name?

7
00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:38.713
The Junior Detective League Shipwreck Case

8
00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.139
Sorry! You ok?!
I didn't see you there!

9
00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.079
Yahoo! This is great!

10
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.209
It's the best summer break ever!

11
00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.059
I'm glad we came
to the ocean prepared!

12
00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.039
Kasuda-san? Of Kasuda Industries?

13
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:54.659
Yep! I'm a rich kid who's ignorant
of his debt to his old man!

14
00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.539
Are you sure taking us
all back isn't a problem?

15
00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.959
The more the merrier! Right, Shinobu?

16
00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.459
Yeah!

17
00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.339
I sure am jealous!
Going scuba diving as a couple!

18
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.119
Yeah, a couple...

19
00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:20.709
Well, if I wasn't rich, there's no
telling how she'd have wound up...

20
00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.499
Teruhiko-san! That's horrible!

21
00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.269
It's okay to be honest, Shinobu.

22
00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.569
What's his deal?! Suddenly
fighting with his girlfriend...

23
00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.659
Hey, Ran-neechan.
Where's the old man fishing anyway?

24
00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.749
He said it was the best spot
in the area and left before dawn...

25
00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.009
I guess it's not in the ocean.
I think he said it was a lake.

26
00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.129
A fishing spot not in the ocean?

27
00:03:56.089 --> 00:04:00.799
Here we go! Another bite!
What a haul!

28
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:04.469
Ok!

29
00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.439
No Trespassing

30
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.399
Shinobu-san left?

31
00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.359
She was in a bad mood.
Happens all the time; no biggie.

32
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.209
You sure that wasn't
your fault? What a weirdo.

33
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.909
A huge haul!

34
00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.879
Whoa! Awesome!

35
00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.459
Way to go, Dad!

36
00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:32.789
Where's that fishing spot?

37
00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.709
I wanna fish too!

38
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.679
No, I can't tell you.

39
00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:37.719
Why not?

40
00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.969
It's a secret spot my
fishing friends told me about!

41
00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.499
He's no fun...

42
00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.389
Let's go play beachball!

43
00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.519
Yeah!

44
00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:53.519
Over there!

45
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.579
Yay!

46
00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:57.489
Conan-kun! Come on!

47
00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:58.829
No thanks...

48
00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:01.199
Huh?

49
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:03.909
Isn't that a parrot fish?

50
00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.009
What about it?

51
00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.209
No, nothing!

52
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.999
How do you catch an ocean fish
in a non-ocean fishing spot?

53
00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.379
He probably bought 'em somewhere.

54
00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:21.219
Mori Kogoro! He's not
just a great detective!

55
00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.679
Mori Kogoro?

56
00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.599
Oh? Who were you again?

57
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.059
My bad!

58
00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:43.369
What's this?

59
00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:45.989
There's paper inside...

60
00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:52.029
What could be written on it?!

61
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.209
What if it's a treasure map?!

62
00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:56.459
This is like out of a movie or novel!

63
00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:00.719
We got it!
We got it!

64
00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:04.179
What the...

65
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:06.389
"SOS Shinobu?!"

66
00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.279
Don't tell me...

67
00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.459
...Shinobu-san needs help-

68
00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:13.899
and sent that message?!

69
00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:18.319
She's up to that again?
I thought she left.

70
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.369
Again?

71
00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.329
Yeah. She does it
all the time. Lemme see.

72
00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:26.989
She's trying to worry me.
She can be a real nuisance.

73
00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.159
You can say that again...

74
00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.829
It's almost full tide.
Maybe I should go again...

75
00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.749
Guys! Don't go into the ocean,
it's dangerous!

76
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:39.339
Okay!
Okay!

77
00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.209
But things are bad if Shinobu-san
really did send an SOS!

78
00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:46.589
We'll have to check for ourselves!

79
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:48.139
But where do we start?

80
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:51.079
If she's on a desert island,
we'll never--

81
00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:56.909
No, that's impossible time-wise!
Plus the paper's not dried up!

82
00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.819
She's not very far away!

83
00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:04.359
Hey, Ran-neechan.

84
00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:07.829
Don't let Kasuda-san
out of your sight.

85
00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:08.829
But why?

86
00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:11.709
We're counting on you!
We're counting on you!

87
00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:14.039
Wait! Where are you guys going?!

88
00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.999
Alright! I'll give another crack at it!

89
00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:21.539
Great! I'll come with you, Mori-san!

90
00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.159
I know about your fishing spot;
we're expanding into this area.

91
00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.259
Well, let's go!

92
00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:33.119
Dad! We need to start packing up!

93
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.599
Ugh! You're all so selfish!

94
00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:41.659
People these days!

95
00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:44.249
Excuse me, Mister!

96
00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:45.279
Not more?!

97
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.109
Hey, you!

98
00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:51.539
Lousy sea-bathers and divers!

99
00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:52.079
Excuse us...

100
00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:54.499
How dare they dirty my ocean!

101
00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:55.709
Excuse us!
Excuse us!

102
00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:57.419
What?

103
00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:01.869
Do you know where that
bottle floated in from?

104
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:02.879
This?

105
00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:04.659
This way, guys!

106
00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:05.499
Right!
Right!

107
00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:13.139
Genta-kun.

108
00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:16.749
What's that for? We're not
here to gather shellfish!

109
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:22.539
Aw, shaddup! I can't just come
here and not catch anything!

110
00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:24.939
You're always thinking about food!

111
00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.659
Let's get some top shells too!

112
00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:29.459
Now you're here just
to catch stuff...

113
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:32.899
You ok, Ayumi?!

114
00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:34.539
I think so...

115
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.579
It's almost full tide!
Be careful!

116
00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:39.829
Look!

117
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:45.079
Shinobu-san?!

118
00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:46.129
It has to be!

119
00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:50.799
Hurry! The cave's
filling up with water!

120
00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:05.399
Shinobu-san! Are you all right?!

121
00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:08.189
Stay with us!

122
00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:09.069
Shinobu-san!

123
00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:15.119
Whew!
Whew!

124
00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:18.539
It's you!

125
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:20.259
What happened?!

126
00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:22.039
What happened, Shinobu-san?

127
00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:27.379
He said he was going to take me
to his special diving spot...

128
00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:32.299
A cave that disappears into
the ocean at high tide...

129
00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:37.539
But when I drank
the juice he brought...

130
00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:38.519
...I suddenly got sleepy.

131
00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:07.249
There were probably
sleeping drugs in the juice.

132
00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:10.539
He wanted his murder
to look like an accident!

133
00:10:10.539 --> 00:10:14.389
He'd create an alibi
while you drowned here.

134
00:10:15.369 --> 00:10:19.969
His nearly hitting us and
starting that fight with you

135
00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:22.439
was all part of his plan!

136
00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:24.409
But why?!

137
00:10:24.409 --> 00:10:28.209
That's for the police to find out.
Let's get out and contact them!

138
00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:29.859
Conan-kun! Look!

139
00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.609
The tide's coming in!

140
00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:34.289
No way!

141
00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:35.789
Let's get out of here!

142
00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:47.079
Out of the boat!
The tide's rising!

143
00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:48.459
Hurry!

144
00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:50.859
Oh no!

145
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.879
Now how do we get back?!

146
00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:56.259
The waves are too high
for us to swim out!

147
00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:00.579
Plus Shinobu-san isn't
fully back to normal!

148
00:11:00.579 --> 00:11:01.679
Oh no!

149
00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:02.999
Someone help!

150
00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:04.479
I don't wanna die!

151
00:11:04.479 --> 00:11:07.209
Everyone calm down! Don't panic!

152
00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:08.879
That's easy for you to say!

153
00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:11.209
If the water fills up to our heads...

154
00:11:11.209 --> 00:11:12.939
...we'll all drown!

155
00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:16.159
What do we do now?!

156
00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:22.539
What's that?!

157
00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:24.829
What is that?

158
00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:28.539
A firefly!

159
00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:29.899
Fireflies?

160
00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:31.579
Here?

161
00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:33.249
That is strange!

162
00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:37.009
What're they doing in a cave
that fills up with water twice a day?!

163
00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:38.969
Could it be?!

164
00:11:38.969 --> 00:11:40.429
Could what be?!
Could what be?!

165
00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:45.439
Maybe the cave has another
exit that they came in from?!

166
00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.259
What?!

167
00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:48.899
Another exit?!

168
00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:51.539
It's our only way out now!

169
00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:55.079
But what if it's too small for people?!

170
00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:56.519
Oh no!

171
00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:59.819
Hey, Conan! We're not fireflies!

172
00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:05.499
The old man's parrot fish
was big but had no scars!

173
00:12:05.499 --> 00:12:07.329
It's not that small of an exit!

174
00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:14.369
It entered the cave during
the high tide before dawn!

175
00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:21.789
It probably got washed through
the cave and into that lake

176
00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:23.889
the old man was at!

177
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:29.159
A non-ocean fishing spot where
you can catch ocean fish!

178
00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:31.209
I see!
That makes sense!

179
00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.609
That's our Conan-kun!

180
00:12:32.609 --> 00:12:35.989
Sorry, old man! Guess you
didn't buy 'em after all!

181
00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:39.389
We'll drown if we stay here!

182
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:40.999
I have faith in Conan-kun!

183
00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.709
Alright! Let's go!

184
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:52.761
What is it, Ayumi-chan?!

185
00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:54.751
Water dripped from the ceiling...

186
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:56.941
Whew...

187
00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:58.611
Don't scare us like that!

188
00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.711
Sorry!

189
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.011
It's like a maze...

190
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:05.161
Which way leads out?

191
00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:07.241
The wrong way will get us lost...

192
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:11.641
But the tide will catch up
if we don't hurry!

193
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:17.251
Alright! Let's just go this way!

194
00:13:17.251 --> 00:13:18.381
Wait, Genta!

195
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:22.451
Huh? What the... It's a dead end!

196
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.231
I told you!

197
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:26.541
Take the path with fireflies!

198
00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:27.491
Good thinking!

199
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:30.951
They'll lead us to the exit!

200
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.951
Split up and look for 'em!

201
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:33.991
OK!
OK!

202
00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:36.821
I'll help too! I'm all better now!

203
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.321
None here!

204
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.321
Nor here!

205
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:44.661
Same here!

206
00:13:44.661 --> 00:13:48.361
I found them! They're here!

207
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.781
Alright! Let's move out!

208
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:01.701
Left or right? It's one or the other...

209
00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:04.451
Alright! Look for more fireflies!

210
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:13.111
No luck. Both are empty.

211
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:15.031
I guess this is the end...

212
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:16.951
Don't say that!

213
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:18.451
What do we do, Conan-kun?!

214
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:21.831
There's still a chance.

215
00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:38.161
This way!

216
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:41.671
Ah! You listened for the different echoes!

217
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:42.321
Yeah!

218
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:46.571
The louder echo was a dead-end.
The quieter one leads ahead!

219
00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:48.811
You're amazing, Conan-kun!

220
00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:50.451
Ok! Let's go!

221
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:04.211
Push!

222
00:15:04.211 --> 00:15:05.421
Harder!

223
00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:17.951
What's that sound?!

224
00:15:19.531 --> 00:15:20.181
Birds!

225
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:21.481
Birds?!
Birds?!

226
00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:25.161
They probably came in
looking for food!

227
00:15:31.111 --> 00:15:33.541
They're flying toward the exit!

228
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:36.321
Alright! Follow them!

229
00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:44.991
Ouch!

230
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:46.451
Are you all right?!

231
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:48.611
Endure it! Let's run!

232
00:15:48.611 --> 00:15:50.361
Come on, guys! Hurry!

233
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:51.921
I'm fine!

234
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.281
I can't hear them anymore!

235
00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:01.361
Don't tell me...

236
00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.821
...they're already outside?

237
00:16:02.821 --> 00:16:05.311
Yeah. We were too late.

238
00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:14.661
Stupid birds scaring me!

239
00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:19.491
What's the matter?

240
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.201
Just wondering if
the peak tide was in...

241
00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:25.161
Where did they run off to?!

242
00:16:26.321 --> 00:16:27.361
Ran-neechan.

243
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:29.961
Don't let Kasuda-san
out of your sight.

244
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:32.071
Whoops!

245
00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:34.951
Be sure to take your trash
when you leave!

246
00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:40.161
Mister! Do you know the best
fishing spot around here?!

247
00:16:41.321 --> 00:16:43.211
Which way now, Conan?!

248
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.201
Which is it?!

249
00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:45.821
Conan-kun!

250
00:16:50.651 --> 00:16:51.611
I don't know.

251
00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:53.491
What?!
What?!

252
00:16:56.611 --> 00:16:57.571
It's the tide!

253
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:09.811
Help!

254
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:11.951
Grab on to me, Shinobu-san!

255
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:14.491
Someone!

256
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:15.821
Help!

257
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:21.971
Darn it! Are we stuck in a dead end?!

258
00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:27.471
The light!

259
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:29.321
It's pitch dark!

260
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:43.081
What is this?!

261
00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:49.611
Now I see! We were at
the top of the cave!

262
00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:53.381
The water's flowing through
to the other exit now!

263
00:17:53.381 --> 00:17:55.491
Where are we?!

264
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:59.161
I can't tell what's up or down,
left or right!

265
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.201
Where will we--

266
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:03.161
That's the exit!

267
00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:09.601
Here it comes!

268
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:15.571
What happened?

269
00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:20.951
I'm stuck!

270
00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:25.871
Darn it! It's too narrow for him!

271
00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:30.581
His life jacket! If I can
just get it off!

272
00:18:32.951 --> 00:18:34.421
It's no use! I'll have to tear it!

273
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:41.301
It won't rip! Isn't there
anything I can use?!

274
00:18:41.301 --> 00:18:43.261
His rake!

275
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:47.141
Ok! Take this!

276
00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:52.691
I'm out of breath!

277
00:19:07.161 --> 00:19:09.271
I thought we were goners!

278
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:10.991
We're alive!

279
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:19.301
What're you doing here?!

280
00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:22.161
Yep! I was right!

281
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:27.161
The water from the high tide
flows into the lake!

282
00:19:27.161 --> 00:19:31.281
The lake's water doesn't rise
because it doesn't flow just one way;

283
00:19:31.281 --> 00:19:35.611
it also flows out during low
tide via another passageway!

284
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:40.611
But it's narrow, so less
water flows in during high tide!

285
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:44.991
How'd you get here anyway?!

286
00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:51.001
I figured this might happen!
Good thing I came just in case!

287
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:51.951
What?!

288
00:19:51.951 --> 00:19:53.361
Ayumi!

289
00:19:53.361 --> 00:19:54.201
Ayumi-chan!

290
00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:55.701
Don't move!

291
00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:58.161
Teruhiko-san! Stop this!

292
00:19:58.161 --> 00:19:59.421
Just what are you--

293
00:19:59.421 --> 00:20:00.741
Shut up!

294
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:06.011
Mister! Use that and your
fake-accident plan will be in vain!

295
00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:10.971
You think I won't shoot, kid?
I have enough bullets for you all!

296
00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:13.181
Help me!

297
00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:14.271
Stop it!

298
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:19.571
Stop it, Teruhiko-san!
It's me you want to kill!

299
00:20:19.571 --> 00:20:21.281
She has nothing to do with this!

300
00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:25.491
Yeah, it's your fault!
You have to die!

301
00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:29.031
Why? Why are you doing this?!

302
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:32.661
My old man ordered me
to marry some monkey-girl!

303
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:35.831
I have no intention to leave
home and be poor with you!

304
00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:39.921
I want to stay a rich kid!

305
00:20:39.921 --> 00:20:41.251
You're terrible!

306
00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:43.611
What a bastard!

307
00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:46.361
But all I have is a rake!

308
00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:49.491
I don't have my Power Shoes
or any other weapons!

309
00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:51.221
Could this really be the end?!

310
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:56.201
I can't leave you alive
now that you know the truth.

311
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:59.201
I'll turn you all into fish food!

312
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:02.731
Imbecile! The sign
says no trespassing!

313
00:21:03.861 --> 00:21:05.361
You'll pay for hurting girls!

314
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.071
A huge victory for the
Junior Detective League!

315
00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:11.701
It was an incident full of thrills,
suspense, adventure,

316
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:14.531
and a little bitterness.

317
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:17.821
And for someone else, it was--

318
00:23:17.821 --> 00:23:21.161
Imbecile! I'll take those!

319
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:22.471
Those are my--

320
00:23:22.471 --> 00:23:24.751
You still don't get it?!

321
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:29.211
He was then lectured
for a full hour...

322
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:36.071
He was fishing in a restricted
area that's dangerous at high tide.

323
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:38.741
Well, he got what
was coming to him!

324
00:23:45.751 --> 00:23:47.201
Shinigami Jinnai!

325
00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:49.411
Give yourself up!

326
00:23:55.121 --> 00:23:59.091
The culprit's still on the 7th floor!
I just saw his shadow!

327
00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:03.371
Why did he shoot?!

328
00:24:03.371 --> 00:24:07.621
And where in the building did
he hide to avoid police detection?!

329
00:24:09.121 --> 00:24:10.371
On the next Conan--

330
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:12.911
The Shinigami Jinnai Murder Case.

331
00:24:14.154 --> 00:24:16.354
Next Conan's hint:

332
00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.294
Elevator.
