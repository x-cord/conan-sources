1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,140
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,840
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,440
Officer of police headquarters and the detective squad.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,640
Love and mystery is on the verge of explosion.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,628
Hey! Isn't that Hide?

9
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,928
Where? I can't see!

10
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:03,528
No! They said on radio just a while ago

11
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:05,828
that Hide is going to be riding the car at the end of the line!

12
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:07,528
Is that right?

13
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:11,228
It sure is unusual to have a soccer victory parade though.

14
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:13,028
It can't be helped.

15
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:14,928
Every year a big fuss is made

16
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:17,128
over the Tokyo Spirits being the winning candidate,

17
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,628
and finally this year

18
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:20,928
they won the J1 championship for the first time!

19
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:25,228
Moreover, they won by a dramatic come-from-behind victory.

20
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,228
Right!

21
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,828
In the second half lost time they were losing 1 to 0,

22
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,728
but Hide tied the game!

23
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,828
And then right after the playoffs, Naoki scored a V goal!

24
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,228
He was awesome!

25
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,928
But with all this crowd,

26
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:39,928
we can't really see the parade.

27
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,028
Right.

28
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,428
I even brought along my video camera.

29
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:44,728
It's so disappointing.

30
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,528
That's why I told you, right?

31
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:49,828
We should've kept watching TV like we were!

32
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:51,028
Come...

33
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,428
We set the video recorder before coming here,

34
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,628
so we can all watch it together later!

35
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,428
Hey! Maybe if we go there,

36
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,028
we can have a better view!

37
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,028
There! Over there!

38
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,128
I see!

39
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,428
If you go on top the empty cans container,

40
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,528
we may get a better view!

41
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,428
-Let's go! -Okay!

42
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,128
How is it?

43
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:14,528
Can you see?

44
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,328
Wait a second...

45
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,928
I can see glimpses of their heads

46
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,928
but not their faces.

47
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:24,528
It hurts...

48
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:27,428
Hey...

49
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:28,528
Darn it.

50
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,328
If it was only a bit higher!

51
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:33,028
But I don't see anything

52
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:34,728
that is higher than this empty cans container.

53
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:36,528
Neither do I...

54
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,028
-That's it! -That's it!

55
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:43,328
Hey...

56
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:50,528
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 1)"

57
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,628
I see him in the distance!

58
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:54,728
It's Hide!

59
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:57,328
Naoki is also behind!

60
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:59,728
It seems like he's looking this way and waving his hand!

61
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:00,928
Really?

62
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:04,128
Hey, let me see too!

63
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,028
Wait a minute.

64
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,728
This is the best part.

65
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:08,928
Hey!

66
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:14,428
You shouldn't climb up there!

67
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,228
I... I'm sorry.

68
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,928
I'll put him down right away.

69
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:20,428
Staying up here a little while won't hurt will it,

70
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,528
old lady?

71
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,128
Hey! What's with the old lady bit?

72
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:26,528
How dare you call me an old lady?

73
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:29,428
If you don't listen to me, I'm going to...

74
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:31,628
arrest you.

75
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,528
Officer Sato!

76
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:36,028
What are you doing dressed like that?

77
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,828
Oh, I get it!

78
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,228
You sneaked of from work

79
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:43,028
and came to watch the parade in secret!

80
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,928
I see! That's why you're in disguise!

81
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,228
No, I'm not!

82
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,928
I have my reasons.

83
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:51,028
You're on a date, right?

84
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:52,928
With Officer Takagi.

85
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,528
Yumi!

86
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,128
I happened to see...

87
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,728
Saw what?

88
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:01,528
Officer Takagi choosing a wig in the restroom just now.

89
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:04,528
Dating while on the move,

90
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:07,528
you guys are pretty cool!

91
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:11,028
-No! This is... -Then...

92
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,328
You can't talk about us.

93
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,928
You mean it's okay for officers to do stuff like that?

94
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:17,628
It's against service regulations.

95
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,328
What will become of the future of Japan?

96
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:23,328
I... I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!

97
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:26,028
We're on duty. On duty!

98
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,028
It's not a date!

99
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,828
Inspector Shiratori.

100
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,328
Why are you in disguise too?

101
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:37,528
We just received an odd fax at the headquarters a while ago.

102
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:39,828
"I am an anti-Spirit."

103
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:41,328
"Something interesting

104
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:44,128
will happen at the championship parade." It said.

105
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,328
And that fax was very similar

106
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,328
to the one that we handled previously.

107
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,628
That's why the First Investigation Division is here too.

108
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:56,428
But, the culprit knows our faces,

109
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:59,128
so we disguise ourselves while investigating.

110
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,828
Well, it's more likely a bad prank

111
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,428
of some jealous fans of the championship.

112
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:05,828
What?

113
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,528
So it's not a date.

114
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,628
No, it's not!

115
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,128
And besides,

116
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,328
the date in question,

117
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,528
is supposed to be next week.

118
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,028
I thought that you couldn't wait till then

119
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:23,228
so you both got eager and...

120
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:25,728
I guess not then.

121
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:28,328
Hey, how come you know about it?

122
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:30,828
Everybody knows about it.

123
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:34,528
You're going to Tropical Marine that just opened, right?

124
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,528
Everybody?

125
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:39,728
Don't take the Japanese police lightly.

126
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:40,928
If he takes a day off

127
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,028
on the day that you're off,

128
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,928
everybody can tell.

129
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,528
I heard that when Officer Takagi

130
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,428
was shoved into the interrogation room

131
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:49,828
and cross examined by everybody,

132
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:52,228
he confessed immediately.

133
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,128
Confessed?

134
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:58,428
About that...

135
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,828
Well, just be careful, okay?

136
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:06,328
It seems that a lot of other people

137
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:09,528
asked for the same day off too.

138
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:10,628
Right...

139
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:12,928
And it also seems that rental reservation

140
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:15,528
of the binoculars and communication equipment

141
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:17,628
for that day is full too.

142
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:20,228
Don't tell me that they're planning to keep an eye on us?

143
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,128
It sure sounds interesting.

144
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:26,328
Then, shall we go to Tropical Marine Land too!

145
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,228
Let's go!

146
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:30,828
You know what?

147
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:33,128
I'm just going out with Officer Takagi

148
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:34,628
because I want to show him my appreciation for helping me before!

149
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,528
So, it's not a date!

150
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,328
Really?

151
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,028
That's hard to believe.

152
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,828
I'm telling you it's true and I'm not lying.

153
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:46,228
Believe me.

154
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:49,028
And? You're just going to sit back

155
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:51,328
and watch this all take place, Inspector Shiratori?

156
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,628
Oh, no.

157
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,428
I'm not going to wave a white flag

158
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:56,928
just because she refused to marry me.

159
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:01,328
They still call each other very formally.

160
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:04,728
There's still room for me to try for her.

161
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,528
Besides, as far as this stakeout is concerned,

162
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,528
I'm the one in charge.

163
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:12,828
Is that right?

164
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:16,328
-Date... -Date...

165
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,128
Hey, Yumi. Help me out here, will you?

166
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,528
Give it your best shot!

167
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:27,128
Oh, my. Talk of the devil, look who's here.

168
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,128
You idiot.

169
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,228
Showing up at a time like this.

170
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,128
Mr. Matsuda.

171
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,028
It's Officer Takagi!

172
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:54,928
You're not hiding under your disguise at all!

173
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:57,828
You've figured me out after all.

174
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,928
I had no idea that you guys would be here, though.

175
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:04,128
But all three police officers were surprised!

176
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,928
Really?

177
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:09,428
Yes. Sort of.

178
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,728
How about you, Ms. Sato?

179
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:15,128
Don't you think I disguised myself quite well?

180
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,728
Ms. Sato?

181
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:39,428
Inspector Megure gave you instructions saying that

182
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,228
you don't have to disguise yourself, didn't he?

183
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:43,728
Oh, yes.

184
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:45,228
But, I thought I should anyway.

185
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:47,528
Then, why do you come dressed like that?

186
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,528
I... I'm sorry.

187
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:52,328
Now that you know, get rid of that disguise right away

188
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:53,928
and go back to your post!

189
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:54,928
Understand?

190
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,728
Okay.

191
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:05,828
I wonder if I did something I shouldn't have.

192
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:09,328
Nope. You just kind of resembled him.

193
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,128
The you just a while ago.

194
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:12,528
Him?

195
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,528
The officer who was employed for only seven days

196
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:19,528
at First Investigation Division

197
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,428
before you came to headquarters.

198
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,028
Hide!

199
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,928
-Naoki! -Naoki!

200
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:36,228
The car that Hide is in seems to have come!

201
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:39,428
Let's force ourselves to the front and take a video of him!

202
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:42,428
But since I've been taping from a while ago,

203
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:43,928
I don't think there's much tape left already.

204
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,128
You mean you didn't bring any spare tape?

205
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,028
I brought it!

206
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:50,528
Then, insert it and let's get on with it!

207
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,528
Okay.

208
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,628
Come on! Hurry!

209
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,228
Please wait.

210
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:59,028
I wonder if everything's going to be okay.

211
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:01,728
You received an odd fax saying that

212
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,428
something was going to happen at this parade, didn't you?

213
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:05,528
Yes.

214
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:10,228
But it seems to have been a prank after all.

215
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:13,628
By the way, what are you doing here, Yumi?

216
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:16,428
I've come to back up giving tickets for illegal parking!

217
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,428
There seems to be a lot of people

218
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,828
parked their cars all over the street

219
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:22,428
in order to see the parade, so...

220
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:25,228
You better move your car quickly too, Officer Takagi!

221
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,528
Or I'll have to give you a parking ticket!

222
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,528
I'll move it right away.

223
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,128
Where are you, everybody?

224
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,328
Excuse me, somebody...

225
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:47,128
Hold on!

226
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:52,328
Congratulations!

227
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,728
But aren't you a fan of Big Osaka?

228
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,928
It's a wonder you came to watch this parade.

229
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,128
I came to place a curse

230
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,728
that they won't win next year.

231
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,528
Hey, where were you?

232
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,028
You've got to film it quick

233
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,628
or the car's going to leave!

234
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,228
Well, the thing is...

235
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:15,828
The key...

236
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:16,928
There.

237
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:20,428
Oh, boy.

238
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:23,528
It's not my day today.

239
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:27,128
What? Somebody took your video camera?

240
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:30,628
Yes. Just a while ago, in the crowd.

241
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:36,928
What is this?

242
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,728
"Unknown number"

243
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,128
What happened?

244
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,991
This is bad.

245
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:15,691
Cancel the parade immediately

246
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,691
and evacuate the people!

247
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:18,791
Yes, sir!

248
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,891
What was that?

249
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,291
A bomb.

250
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,591
It seems like a car blew up.

251
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:29,891
Isn't that car Officer Takagi's car?

252
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,891
Don't tell me that Officer Takagi...

253
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,691
It's possible.

254
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,591
Because just a while ago, I saw somebody go over to that car

255
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,691
from the space between the crowds.

256
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,091
Darn it!

257
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,391
Hey, Conan!

258
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:44,791
Inspector Shiratori!

259
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,991
Where's Officer Takagi?

260
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,691
It exploded

261
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:52,491
just as he went over to the car to move it.

262
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,791
If he got caught in the explosion,

263
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,291
I doubt that he would make it.

264
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,891
Then, you mean that Officer Takagi...

265
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,591
Oh, no.

266
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,091
That's only if the worst happens.

267
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,691
What's that supposed to mean?

268
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:11,391
I made it to safety by a hair's breadth,

269
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:14,291
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

270
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,891
Officer Takagi!

271
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:17,591
You're okay!

272
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,791
Yeah, somehow.

273
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:24,691
I coincidentally found a paper bag

274
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:28,791
that wasn't under the car when I parked.

275
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,491
Just when I was about to return

276
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:34,891
and consult with Inspector Shiratori that this may be a bomb...

277
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,891
The car exploded.

278
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,591
It's amazing that you though the content

279
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,091
inside the paper bag may have been a bomb.

280
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:46,391
Oh, that's because...

281
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,291
It's only natural.

282
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,991
I mentioned already

283
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,191
that the fax that was received at headquarters

284
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,791
resembled the one of a case

285
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,791
that we were involved with previously, right?

286
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:01,491
If the officer was briefed on the case failed to notice

287
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,091
that it may have been a bomb, something is wrong.

288
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,891
Talk about failing to notice, look at her.

289
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:11,391
She still doesn't seem to realize that you're okay.

290
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:14,091
-Let's stop her! -Officer Sato?

291
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:17,191
Officer Takagi...

292
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:20,791
No, Sato! You won't make it!

293
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,391
It's dangerous, stay back!

294
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,891
But, he's still inside.

295
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,391
He's still inside...

296
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,891
He's inside!

297
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,091
Hey, Miwako!

298
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,591
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:43,191
I... I'm trying to lift the car up and get him out.

300
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:46,191
Officer Takagi is fine. See?

301
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,891
Officer Sato?

302
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,391
Aren't that burns on the palm of your hands!

303
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:56,791
Hey, we've got to treat it right away!

304
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,291
I guess so.

305
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,891
I'll let you take care of things from here then.

306
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:06,491
Tears?

307
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:11,791
It seems that the one Officer Sato was trying to rescue was...

308
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,191
Yes.

309
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:17,291
Probably Officer Matsuda.

310
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,891
Officer Matsuda?

311
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:23,291
The type of bomb is a plastic bomb!

312
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,491
The detonating device is not the timer type,

313
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,891
but wireless!

314
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:31,991
A cell phone or something was probably used to activate it.

315
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,891
Then, don't tell me that...

316
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,091
Yes.

317
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,191
The bomber was probably

318
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:40,091
watching you approach the car from somewhere nearby,

319
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:43,691
and pushed the switch of the detonation device.

320
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:45,091
What?

321
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,291
Right.

322
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,991
Which means that although the type of bomb is not the same,

323
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:52,291
there's a high probability that

324
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,991
the bomber is after the lives of the police force,

325
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:57,991
just as was the case three years ago!

326
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,491
So, all of you keep that in mind

327
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,191
and work with great care,

328
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,191
yet speedily to arrest the bomber.

329
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,191
Excuse me.

330
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,291
What is it?

331
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,691
The bomber could've been filmed in the video camera!

332
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:17,691
Mitsuhiko was taking video all through right near the site.

333
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:18,991
Really?

334
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,091
Yes.

335
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,091
Besides, somebody among the crowd,

336
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,991
who were watching the parade, stole the camera.

337
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,791
-Yes. -The camera was stolen?

338
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,991
Yes but the tape is fine!

339
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:34,691
He inserted a new tape just before the camera was stolen

340
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:37,491
because he was running out of tape.

341
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,891
The video camera's fine too!

342
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,391
It was thrown away

343
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,291
in a trash can of a nearby station with only the tape removed!

344
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,291
Which means the person who stole the camera,

345
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,191
wanted the tape and not the camera, right?

346
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:53,591
The only ones who would do something like that

347
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:57,191
has to be a fervent fan of the Spirits

348
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,391
that wanted the film of the parade

349
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,891
or someone who didn't want to be taped,

350
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,291
like the bomber, right?

351
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:11,691
We connected it to a large monitor

352
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,991
and looked through it but...

353
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:18,491
It was mostly only Mitsuhiko's feet.

354
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:22,091
I forgot that I kept the filming

355
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:24,091
with the camera facing down.

356
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:27,691
I can tell what you guys are talking about.

357
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:31,391
But the scene cannot be seen on the tape.

358
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:33,991
Inspector Megure gave you instructions saying that

359
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,391
you don't have to disguise yourself, didn't he?

360
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:38,691
Who is this man?

361
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:41,191
I'm sorry, that's me.

362
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,491
How come you taped this part okay?

363
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,091
I'm sorry, I just happened to film it.

364
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:51,091
Hey, Officer Sato looks to be crying.

365
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:57,491
Oh, no, well you see this is...

366
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:02,891
Somebody is behind you near the car.

367
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,691
It looks like a passerby...

368
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,891
Besides, at this distance

369
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,191
it's hard to tell one person from the next.

370
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:13,191
Oh, no! The camera's face down again!

371
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:16,891
And that's the end of the tape.

372
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,391
It seems that the scene

373
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:25,591
that we were expecting of the bomber placing the paper bag

374
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:28,691
under Officer Takagi's car was not filmed.

375
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:31,791
Maybe something was filmed in the first part of the tape,

376
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,891
that among the crowd!

377
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:36,691
Why don't we rewind the tape and look at it then?

378
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:42,891
Yes, this is Megure.

379
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:44,991
What?

380
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:47,291
Another bomb went off?

381
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,191
Yes.

382
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,691
This time it was at the phone booth in front of Haido Park.

383
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:56,591
Fortunately, nobody's been hurt, though.

384
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:58,091
From the type of bomb that was used,

385
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:00,091
it's most likely the same bomber.

386
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,991
Okay, got it.

387
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:05,091
Go on and continue investigations.

388
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:06,191
Hey.

389
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:08,991
What road is there to get

390
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:12,091
from the first site of the explosion to the Haido Park?

391
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:15,491
The road order of the parade of the Spirits!

392
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:19,591
Which means that the bomber is not after us, the police,

393
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,091
but carried out an extremely heinous prank

394
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,791
against the Tokyo Spirits.

395
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,691
Officer Sato.

396
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,991
Are you all right?

397
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,391
How's your hands?

398
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,391
I heard you got burns.

399
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:33,191
No problem. I can go!

400
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,791
Okay, we've figured out what the bomber is after!

401
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:40,891
Moreover, he may have set bombs up elsewhere too!

402
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,391
Get all the officers nearby

403
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,491
and go to the front of the course of the parade,

404
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,891
and evacuate the people in the vicinity!

405
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,291
Do what you can to take the suspect into custody,

406
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,091
then search for the bombs with all your might!

407
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,691
-On the double! -Yes, sir!

408
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,791
Just in case, Shiratori,

409
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,991
will you contact the bomb disposal crew

410
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,691
and have them stand by?

411
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,591
Yes, sir!

412
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:06,391
Officer Takagi, I want you to stay back here

413
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,691
and keep checking the video.

414
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:11,391
If you find anything, contact me immediately!

415
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:13,791
But I want to go to the site too.

416
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,391
You can't. You wait back here.

417
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,891
Officer Sato.

418
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:22,891
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

419
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:30,591
Strange.

420
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:34,891
What is the culprit after anyway?

421
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:37,691
Pretending to be the bomber of three years ago,

422
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,391
sending fax to headquarters,

423
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,991
and blowing up the car of the officer that is dispatched.

424
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,991
But, soon afterwards,

425
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,491
the culprit blows up a phone booth

426
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,891
that has nothing to do with the police.

427
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,991
I wonder if it's really only a prank

428
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,191
of bad taste towards the Spirits.

429
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,791
And, besides, this tape that Mitsuhiko took.

430
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,791
Is something that will point out the bomber

431
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,491
really filmed on it?

432
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,991
If so,

433
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,591
what was filmed?

434
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,491
"Next Episode" -Are you really watching it carefully?

435
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:51,091
I watched it three time already.

436
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:53,391
If you think that the crowd is suspicious,

437
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,591
everybody in the crowd looks suspicious

438
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:56,791
and if you think nothing is suspicious,

439
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,991
nothing looks suspicious.

440
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:03,491
Maybe the culprit thought he was being filmed

441
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:06,591
although nothing was filmed?

442
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:08,391
Nothing was filmed?

443
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,591
I see!

444
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,791
Next Conan,

445
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:16,079
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 2)"

446
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:18,618
-Next Conan's Hint: -Hold on.

447
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:20,818
"Mail truck"

448
00:24:20,818 --> 00:24:23,118
The case and love are both solved in the next episode?

449
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:24,218
I don't think love worked out, did it?

450
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:25,964
I have a feeling this is going take till next year.
