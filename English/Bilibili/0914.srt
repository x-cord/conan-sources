1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,970
The police cornered jewelry store robber,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,170
"Iwao Takatori (38)" -Iwao Takatori, in a warehouse.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,670
But just as I was beginning to explain my reasoning

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,270
as the Sleeping Kogoro...

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,070
What?

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,270
Run!

7
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,670
Don't move!

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,970
Takatori, stop right...

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,070
Conan?

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,370
Kid?

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,470
Stand up.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,570
Don't move!

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,170
I'll blow the kid's head apart...

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,370
like a crushed tomato.

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,570
-Wait! -Takatori!

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,470
Conan!

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,970
Takatori kidnapped me so I could retrieve the stolen jewels

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,370
from the body of Utsumi,

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,170
the man who betrayed him.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,570
Is this all?

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,470
Hiding them won't do you any good.

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,270
I'm not hiding anything.

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,570
I thought it was strange, too.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,970
Didn't you steal 300 million yen worth of jewels?

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,470
This clearly isn't enough.

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,770
It was him.

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,570
He talked him into it.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,070
For less than half a share,

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,370
he agreed to kill me.

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,170
Idiot!

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,270
Who's "he"?

32
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,570
Mister, maybe you were betrayed.

33
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,870
What are you going to do now?

34
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,470
Are you going to...

35
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,770
Your job's over.

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,370
Keep your curiosity in check.

37
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,970
If you think I won't kill a kid,

38
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,570
you're dead wrong.

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,670
Where?

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,570
Where are we going?

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,570
He's slowing down?

42
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,070
What's happening?

43
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,570
What's he going to do?

44
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,370
Want to get out again, kid?

45
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,570
If you're lucky, you might be saved.

46
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,670
What?

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,270
Farewell.

48
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,870
When the countdown reaches zero,

49
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,370
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

50
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,870
A kidnapping and someone being pushed down a chimney!

51
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,970
Where is this case of betrayal headed?

52
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,670
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:26,912
"Conan Kidnapped (Part 2)"

56
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:39,112
What happened to me?

57
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,612
Where am I?

58
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:51,912
What?

59
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:53,612
You found Conan?

60
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:54,712
What?

61
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:57,012
Where is he? Is he all right?

62
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:58,912
"Beika Central Hospital"

63
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:01,612
A chimney?

64
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:08,012
Yeah. The body of his accomplice, Utsumi was there.

65
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,012
Takatori must've killed him.

66
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:11,912
No.

67
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,912
I don't think so.

68
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:18,612
He probably tried to kill him but failed.

69
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,512
Did Takatori tell you that?

70
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:22,812
I find that hard to believe.

71
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,912
But he said someone talked his accomplice

72
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:30,412
into trying to kill him for less than half a share.

73
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:31,712
Someone...

74
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:34,412
Which means there's another accomplice...

75
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:37,712
No, a mastermind.

76
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:39,512
If that's true,

77
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:42,112
then there's more to this case than we thought.

78
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,612
Takagi, find the abandoned factory immediately.

79
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,412
Confirm Utsumi's death

80
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:53,212
and search for clues to Takatori's whereabouts.

81
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,512
Chiba, determine who this "someone" is

82
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:57,712
from their mutual acquaintances.

83
00:06:57,712 --> 00:06:58,712
Yes, sir!

84
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:04,512
Conan!

85
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:05,712
Are you okay?

86
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,512
Ran.

87
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:10,012
Sorry for making you worry.

88
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,912
He's not badly hurt.

89
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:14,112
They're keeping him in the hospital

90
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,812
for a few days for observation.

91
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,512
That's good.

92
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,312
You didn't tell me anything, dad.

93
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:21,512
Sorry.

94
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:25,512
I thought I'd make sure he was safe first.

95
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,812
I know. But I'm really glad

96
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:31,612
that you're all right.

97
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:32,612
Ran...

98
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:36,712
I feel tired.

99
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:41,512
Well, we should get going.

100
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,612
Right.

101
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,912
Look after him, Ran.

102
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,412
Got it.

103
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:49,812
Take care.

104
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,512
Conan, is there anything you want?

105
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:56,612
I'm a little thirsty.

106
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,612
Then I'll ask a nurse

107
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:02,312
if it's okay for me to buy you a drink.

108
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,612
Okay. Sorry.

109
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,112
For what?

110
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,112
Just take it easy.

111
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,212
I'm really sorry, Ran.

112
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:21,112
The only clue I have so far is...

113
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:25,312
"Shingetsu Bar"

114
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:28,612
I need to stop Takatori soon.

115
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,712
In any case, I'd better check it out.

116
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:40,512
What? Conan?

117
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,612
You can't be serious.

118
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:45,512
What?

119
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:48,012
Conan is missing again?

120
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:50,012
What should we do, dad?

121
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,612
What if he's in danger again?

122
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,412
Find him and bring him back, dad.

123
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:56,712
Gosh.

124
00:08:56,712 --> 00:09:01,512
That busybody's always causing headaches.

125
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,812
Did something happen to Conan?

126
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,612
You won't believe what happened.

127
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,912
Please.

128
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:10,512
Please help me look for him.

129
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,312
Got it.

130
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:20,912
Takatori's goals are most likely acquiring his share,

131
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:25,412
and getting revenge on someone who betrayed him.

132
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:28,812
He talked him into it.

133
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,212
For less than half a share,

134
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:34,512
he agreed to kill me.

135
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,612
Idiot!

136
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:38,212
I'll stop him.

137
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,512
Stop the car.

138
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,912
"Shingetsu Bar"

139
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,412
"Genji"

140
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,512
This is it.

141
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:09,912
"Shingetsu Bar"

142
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,412
"Genji"

143
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,412
That's it.

144
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,312
It won't open.

145
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:23,912
"Utsumi"

146
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:25,112
Is this...

147
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,712
"Tokuro Utsumi (32)"

148
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,012
It's that man's apartment.

149
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,712
There's no mistaking it.

150
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,412
The body inside the chimney

151
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:45,112
belongs to Takatori's accomplice, Utsumi.

152
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:50,112
However, we haven't found any clues to Takatori's location.

153
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:52,412
Chiba is currently

154
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,012
looking into Utsumi's personal life.

155
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,412
This place is awful.

156
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,212
It's not that old.

157
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,312
This man...

158
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:32,312
"Jewelry Shop Shimazu" -He worked at the jewelry shop...

159
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:33,812
"Buyer, Setsuo Yamaga" -Takatori robbed.

160
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:44,512
What's this?

161
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:48,612
Utsumi, Takatori, and Yamaga.

162
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,112
Who's the last person?

163
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:56,512
But I'm starting to see what's really going on.

164
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:01,812
What's that?

165
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:09,212
What's this?

166
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:13,112
Today at 4:00 pm, HK.

167
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:14,812
Hong Kong?

168
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,412
And it's at 4:00 pm.

169
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:20,012
I've got an hour and a half.

170
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:35,012
What?

171
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:36,112
Takatori?

172
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,212
Gosh.

173
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:42,612
You're quite the mischievous boy, kid.

174
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,612
Did you kill him?

175
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:50,612
I can see why you'd think that.

176
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:55,012
But he's not the one who betrayed me.

177
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:58,212
Then is the fourth man that "someone"?

178
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:10,112
Mister, wait!

179
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:12,012
Open the door!

180
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,112
In that case...

181
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:15,512
Oh, no.

182
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:18,012
Darn it. What should I do?

183
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,579
I've determined Utsumi's address.

184
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:32,179
I'm on my way there now.

185
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,479
What?

186
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,179
Where did you come from?

187
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,579
Lucky me.

188
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,079
Taxi!

189
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,879
Drive, please.

190
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,279
Mouri speaking.

191
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,779
Mister, where are you?

192
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,379
Conan?

193
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,279
Chiba?

194
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,479
What?

195
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,979
You found Yamaga's body at Utsumi's apartment?

196
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:31,179
What?

197
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,479
Don't be ridiculous, Conan.

198
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,979
Where are you?

199
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,079
Hong Kong?

200
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,279
What?

201
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,779
Yes. HK...

202
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,979
We believe he's getting on the 4:00 pm flight to Hong Kong.

203
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,879
I see. A plane.

204
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,279
Conan, are you on your way to the airport?

205
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,379
I am. Hurry, Pops.

206
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,479
Thank you.

207
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,479
I appreciate the help.

208
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,379
Everyone head to the airport immediately!

209
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,579
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

210
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,979
So you've already exchanged the jewels for cash

211
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,679
and are off to an elegant overseas vacation.

212
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,279
You've forgotten my share.

213
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,179
And the fee you owe Utsumi for hiring him to kill me!

214
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,379
Darn!

215
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,679
Will I make it in time?

216
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,279
Too scared to talk?

217
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,379
Go to the underworld!

218
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:14,979
That's it.

219
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,279
Go!

220
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,879
Mister, get down!

221
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,379
Now we're even.

222
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,579
You said you'd kill a child,

223
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:05,379
but you threw me into the median.

224
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:07,479
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

225
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,879
You even slowed down.

226
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:16,579
Who are you?

227
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,379
Conan Edogawa.

228
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:20,779
I'm a detective.

229
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,979
You're a sharp kid.

230
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,079
Takatori.

231
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,679
You can't escape this time.

232
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,879
Inspector.

233
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,379
On the ground behind you is the robbery accomplice

234
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:40,179
and suspect wanted for murder and attempted murder.

235
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,479
Takatori's "someone" and jewelry store owner.

236
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,379
Arrest Teruaki Shimazu!

237
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,379
What was that?

238
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,779
What do you mean, Mouri?

239
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,779
I thought Takatori killed his accomplice Utsumi

240
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:04,679
and the buyer Yamaga who leaked the information.

241
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,779
No.

242
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,479
Utsumi died accidentally when he fell from the chimney

243
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,579
while trying to kill Takatori.

244
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,479
And Yamaga was killed

245
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:19,779
by none other than Teruaki Shimazu.

246
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,379
This is ridiculous.

247
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,279
What proof do you have?

248
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,579
He was trying to kill me.

249
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,279
I was defending myself.

250
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,379
What?

251
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:33,979
Mister, you smell like noodles soup.

252
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,579
Did you eat noodles soup somewhere? Or...

253
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:41,279
There were footprints at Utsumi's apartment

254
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,179
in the broth of a spilled instant noodles cup.

255
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,879
But the victim Utsumi's socks were clean.

256
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,279
That's right.

257
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,779
Which means it was...

258
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,779
Shimazu, could you please take off your socks

259
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,779
so we can check them?

260
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,179
I refuse to accept this.

261
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,679
Why would I steal jewels from my own jewelry store?

262
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,879
Because...

263
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:14,079
Because you insured the valuable jewels.

264
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,179
It'd be easy enough to figure out.

265
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:22,379
That and the jewelry store's circumstances that required it.

266
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,579
Yamaga wasn't so much an accomplice

267
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,079
as he was forced to cooperate with your orders,

268
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,679
without realizing he'd be framed

269
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,579
for leaking information and murdered.

270
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,479
You probably enticed him

271
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:47,979
by saying he could join you and Utsumi in Hong Kong.

272
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,279
-Cheers! -Cheers!

273
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:23,479
I'm impressed you noticed, Conan.

274
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:28,879
The cup noodles were just like someone else's crepe.

275
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,379
What?

276
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:36,479
Pops told me about his reasoning that was interrupted.

277
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,879
The Sleeping Kogoro.

278
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:43,979
One more thing,

279
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,579
even though you always wore masks,

280
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,379
there was a incriminating piece of evidence

281
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,479
captured by the cameras.

282
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,979
So that's what it was.

283
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,779
You're the great detective's assistant.

284
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,479
Actually, it's the other way around.

285
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,479
Well done, Mouri!

286
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,879
You finished your explanation that was interrupted.

287
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,079
You've redeemed yourself.

288
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,379
This isn't good.

289
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:07,479
Something feels different this time.

290
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:09,279
Maybe you're hungover.

291
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,079
You're right. I did have too much to drink yesterday.

292
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,079
Just yesterday?

293
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,879
Oh, almost forgot.

294
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:18,879
Here.

295
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,679
Thank you.

296
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,579
Call Ran.

297
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:26,379
She's worried about you.

298
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,979
Right.

299
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,379
"Ran Mouri"

300
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,379
Ran?

301
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,779
Conan?

302
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:41,979
Where have you been? What have you been doing?

303
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:44,279
You'd better come straight home this time!

304
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,579
We need to talk!

305
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,979
Ran, I'm really sorry.

306
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,879
"Next Episode"

307
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,179
Sorry.

308
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:01,979
Does this look like the arm you saw?

309
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:04,679
The same flowerbeds are on the roof.

310
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,879
If what I saw was on the roof,

311
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,379
then the body's buried up there.

312
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:11,279
There's one logical conclusion.

313
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,979
The culprit couldn't dispose of it.

314
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:15,079
In other words,

315
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,379
the body should still be hidden in this building!

316
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,279
Next Conan,

317
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,379
"High School Girl Detective Sonoko Suzuki"

318
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:27,322
Next Conan's Hint:

319
00:24:27,322 --> 00:24:29,622
"Rings"

320
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:31,322
High school girl detective Sonoko's in the next episode?

321
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,322
It's been a while.

322
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,222
I have a bad feeling about this.
