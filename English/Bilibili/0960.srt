1
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.160
Hey! Coming your way, Haibara!

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.080
Huh?

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.450
What are you doing?

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.490
It's your fault for kicking
it someplace weird!

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.460
Who, me?

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.400
Yes!

7
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.420
Ai-chan, I'll go get it.

8
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.460
Thanks, Yoshida-san.

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.550
Yoshida-san.

10
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.170
What's the matter?

11
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.470
That woman...

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.400
She seems sort of sad.

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.160
Yeah.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.130
Hey, someone's coming.

15
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.410
I see. She's been waiting for him.

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.120
Doesn't look that way.

17
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.050
Is she waiting for someone?

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.030
Does it matter?

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.090
I'm curious.

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.800
A beautiful woman is
drinking alone in a park.

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.970
There must be some reason for it.

22
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.040
Let's ask her what she's doing.

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.420
I agree!

24
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.310
Guys!

25
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.310
Jeez. Sticking their noses where
they don't belong again...

26
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.940
Komori Tomoko (35)
Widow

27
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.080
Hey.

28
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.320
What are you doing?

29
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.220
Who, me?

30
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.490
Why are you drinking alone in the park?

31
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.830
Oh, you saw me. How embarrassing.

32
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.710
Why do you have two glasses
when you're alone inâ€”

33
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.570
I-I didn't mean anything by it.

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.800
Don't cry.

35
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.720
Ma'am, are you okay?

36
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.200
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.850
The tears came when I remembered.

38
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.730
What did you remember?

39
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.040
My beloved...

40
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.730
He died...

41
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.380
What are we supposed to do about this?

42
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.190
Right now at this moment,
light pierces the darkness!

43
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.250
Overcome all limits with
your cool reasoning skills!

44
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.330
A woman drinking alone...

45
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.940
What drama awaits behind those tears?

46
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.380
Always determining the one truth

47
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.250
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

48
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.630
his name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:13.938 --> 00:04:14.478
Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys

50
00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:16.888
"Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys!"
Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys

51
00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:19.948
Miss Lonely and the Detective Boys

52
00:04:19.948 --> 00:04:22.448
Sasagokita Botanical Garden

53
00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:27.458
How pretty.

54
00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:34.008
There are all kinds of flowers blooming.

55
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:35.708
I'm impressed.

56
00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:37.548
Let's go over there.

57
00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:38.508
Okay.

58
00:04:38.508 --> 00:04:40.888
Hey, wait!

59
00:04:40.888 --> 00:04:42.558
Guys!

60
00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:46.638
How nice. They have so much energy.

61
00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:49.508
By the way, Tomoko-san,
are you sure this is okay?

62
00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:53.008
You brought us to this botanical garden.

63
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:57.898
It's fine. Spending the weekend
alone was boring anyway.

64
00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:00.418
Tomoko-san, come here!

65
00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:02.678
Wait! I'll be right there!

66
00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:05.768
But is this really for the best?

67
00:05:05.768 --> 00:05:10.958
Well, I doubt she has time to be
sad while handling those kids.

68
00:05:11.438 --> 00:05:12.918
Maybe it's good for her.

69
00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:14.588
Yeah.

70
00:05:14.588 --> 00:05:18.378
I wasn't sure what would happen when
she started crying in the park,

71
00:05:18.378 --> 00:05:20.228
but maybe it turned out all right.

72
00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:21.178
Yeah.

73
00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:22.678
It's an emergency!

74
00:05:22.858 --> 00:05:25.178
We can't find Ayumi-chan!

75
00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:26.308
What?

76
00:05:26.648 --> 00:05:28.888
There is a lost child in the park.

77
00:05:28.888 --> 00:05:33.658
The friends of Yoshida Ayumi-chan, a girl
dressed in red, are looking for her.

78
00:05:34.118 --> 00:05:36.318
Please come to the information
center if you have any information.

79
00:05:36.318 --> 00:05:38.758

81
00:05:42.398 --> 00:05:44.628
She'll be found right away.

82
00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:46.198
Thank you.

83
00:05:49.108 --> 00:05:52.208
It's okay. I'm sure she's fine.

84
00:05:54.218 --> 00:05:54.958
Excuse me.

85
00:05:55.298 --> 00:05:58.978
I think this is the lost girl
from the announcement just now.

86
00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:00.618
Ayumi-chan!

87
00:06:01.668 --> 00:06:03.468
Conan-kun, Ai-chan!

88
00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:04.758
Ayumi-chan!

89
00:06:04.758 --> 00:06:07.098
Ai-chan, I was so scared!

90
00:06:07.098 --> 00:06:07.258
There, there.

91
00:06:07.258 --> 00:06:08.718
Kajiki Kohei (45)
Men's Cosmetics Company President
There, there.

92
00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:09.688
Excuse me.

Kajiki Kohei (45)
Men's Cosmetics Company President

94
00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.848
Thank you so much.

95
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.648
It's fine. I'm just glad
your daughter is all right.

96
00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:19.548
Oh, she's not mine.

97
00:06:19.548 --> 00:06:20.188
What?

98
00:06:20.468 --> 00:06:24.198
They're friends. I don't have any children.

99
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:26.818
Oh, excuse me.

100
00:06:27.018 --> 00:06:28.908
It's fine.

101
00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:31.248
You must like kids.

102
00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:32.328
Yes.

103
00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.328
So do I.

104
00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:39.218
Well, goodbye.

105
00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:39.838
Goodbye.

106
00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:44.228
Now that I'm relieved, I'm hungry.

107
00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:45.698
Perfect timing.

108
00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:48.348
Why don't we have lunch together?

109
00:06:48.618 --> 00:06:50.538
I'd like to thank you.

110
00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:53.298
I'm terribly sorry, but I don't think I can.

111
00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:53.768
Come on.

112
00:06:54.008 --> 00:06:54.888
Let's go.

113
00:06:54.888 --> 00:06:56.188
Um...

114
00:06:57.388 --> 00:06:58.528
Is this okay?

115
00:06:58.528 --> 00:06:59.868
Why wouldn't it be?

116
00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:02.208
Come on. Let's go, everyone!

117
00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:03.648
Okay!

118
00:07:05.018 --> 00:07:08.738
Kajiki Kohei-san, you're
a company president?

119
00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:12.348
I manufacture and sell men's cosmetics.

120
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.618
I see.

121
00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:15.898
What are mech prosthetics?

122
00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:18.498
It's men's cosmetics, Genta-kun.

123
00:07:18.868 --> 00:07:21.168
It's makeup for men.

124
00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:25.338
In this day and age, men need to take
proper care of their appearance, too.

125
00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:29.338
Kajiki-san, do you often
come to botanical gardens?

126
00:07:29.338 --> 00:07:30.318
Yes.

127
00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:33.228
I said the same thing in a
magazine interview the other day,

128
00:07:33.228 --> 00:07:36.728
but I love the outdoors and
frequently go on walks alone.

129
00:07:37.318 --> 00:07:40.478
I love exercise, too. I even play soccer.

130
00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:44.238
Really? We're good at soccer, too.

131
00:07:44.528 --> 00:07:47.468
Should we play a game sometime?

132
00:07:47.468 --> 00:07:49.648
Bring it on!

133
00:07:49.648 --> 00:07:53.558
By the way, Kajiki-san,
do you have a girlfriend?

134
00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:55.498
What? Oh, um...

135
00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:57.968
Well, I...

136
00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:00.338
I'm curious, too.

137
00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:01.928
Do you?

138
00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:04.628
Embarrassingly, not at this time.

139
00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:08.208
Oh, my. In that case, what
kind of women do you like?

140
00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.638
Aw, jeez.

141
00:08:11.598 --> 00:08:14.138
Several Days Later

142
00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:18.078
Hey, mister! Coming your way!

143
00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:20.478
Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:21.148 --> 00:08:24.128
Hey, quit spacing out!

145
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:25.648
Oh, sorry.

146
00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:31.028
Hey! Ball's coming your way, mister!

147
00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:32.818
Okay.

148
00:08:32.818 --> 00:08:36.498
Does Tomoko-san seem
totally different to you?

149
00:08:36.498 --> 00:08:38.658
She's pursuing him in her own way.

150
00:08:39.158 --> 00:08:41.208
Huh? What does that mean?

151
00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:46.088
What? I mean Tomoko-san is trying
to match Kajiki-san's tastes.

152
00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:48.578
But why?

153
00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:49.468
Idiot.

154
00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:52.618
Wow!

155
00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:53.628
That looks delicious!

156
00:08:53.628 --> 00:08:55.718
What a broad variety!

157
00:08:58.388 --> 00:08:59.788
It's good!

158
00:08:59.788 --> 00:09:02.088
Really? That's great.

159
00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:04.448
You've got food on your face.

160
00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.358
Thanks.

161
00:09:07.888 --> 00:09:12.218
Um, Kajiki-san, do you like it?

162
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.988
Oh, yes. Very much.

163
00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:18.998
Really? That's good.

164
00:09:20.438 --> 00:09:26.248
I'm delighted there are meatballs
in this lunch. They're my favorite.

165
00:09:26.918 --> 00:09:33.828
I was thinking how happy I would be
if I could eat like this every day.

166
00:09:34.888 --> 00:09:36.688
Oh, uh...

167
00:09:36.688 --> 00:09:38.858
Is that a proposal?

168
00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:40.978
No, I didn't mean it like that.

169
00:09:40.978 --> 00:09:45.888
I mean, not entirely, but, uh...

170
00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:48.768
Several Days Later

171
00:09:48.768 --> 00:09:51.108
What are we doing today? Soccer again?
Several Days Later

172
00:09:51.108 --> 00:09:52.198
What are we doing today? Soccer again?

173
00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:55.568
Since she invited us to
her house, I doubt that.

174
00:09:55.568 --> 00:09:57.488
I want to play cards.

175
00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:00.648
Why are you coming with us, Professor?

176
00:10:01.098 --> 00:10:06.178
Since she's been looking after you
kids, I thought I should thank her.

177
00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:09.868
Are you sure you didn't come because
you heard Tomoko-san is beautiful?

178
00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:12.398
That might be a factor.

179
00:10:16.268 --> 00:10:18.818
Anyway, this place is huge.

180
00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.438
Does she live here alone?

181
00:10:21.438 --> 00:10:25.518
Before her husband passed away,
it was probably the two of them.

182
00:10:27.118 --> 00:10:30.198
Who is it?

183
00:10:30.198 --> 00:10:31.898
Oh, uh...

184
00:10:32.288 --> 00:10:34.198
It's Professor Agasa.

185
00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:38.778
I'm something like a guardian to these kids.

186
00:10:38.978 --> 00:10:41.058
Oh, is that right?

187
00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:43.418
Please come in.

188
00:10:43.418 --> 00:10:45.288
Excuse the intrusion!

189
00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:47.788
Kajiki-san's here, too.

190
00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:52.298
Yes. Kohei-san is waiting
inside for all of you.

191
00:10:57.968 --> 00:11:02.428
I invited you here today because
I have something to tell you.

192
00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:06.798
Didn't I tell you? She's not single anymore.

193
00:11:08.428 --> 00:11:11.508
By the way, where is Kajiki-san?

194
00:11:11.508 --> 00:11:13.068
On the third floor terrace.

195
00:11:13.608 --> 00:11:17.068
We were eating and chatting
together just now.

196
00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:21.578
Afterwards we had a drink,
and he began to feel tired.

197
00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:24.658
He having a bit of a nap at the moment.

198
00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:27.978
Your phone is ringing.

199
00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:29.338
It's not mine.

200
00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:33.868
It's not mine either.

201
00:11:34.968 --> 00:11:35.838
We're here.

202
00:11:36.118 --> 00:11:38.158
Then whose phone isâ€”

203
00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:48.688
What?!

204
00:11:49.948 --> 00:11:51.098
Wasn't that...?

205
00:11:51.098 --> 00:11:51.688
Could it be?

206
00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:10.425
The deceased is Kajiki
Kohei-san, forty-five years old.

207
00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:14.175
He was the president of a
men's cosmetics company.

208
00:12:15.365 --> 00:12:16.885
What's the cause of death?

209
00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:19.985
A cerebral contusion resulting from a fall.

210
00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:22.435
He seems to have fallen from there.

211
00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:26.805
Are you the owner of the house?

212
00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:29.195
Yes.

213
00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:33.205
Forgive me, but what was your
relationship with Kajiki-san?

214
00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:37.165
He and I were in a romantic relationship.

215
00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:39.245
You were dating?

216
00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:40.205
Yes.

217
00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:44.295
We met and began dating quite recently.

218
00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:46.205
He proposed to me today.

219
00:12:46.435 --> 00:12:47.775
Today?

220
00:12:47.775 --> 00:12:51.335
He'd asked me before,

221
00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:55.165
but I had just lost my husband.

222
00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:59.625
Judging by the situation,
foul play seems unlikely.

223
00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.795
We can't be sure yet.

224
00:13:02.795 --> 00:13:03.805
Excuse me.

225
00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:05.725
This was an accident.

226
00:13:06.075 --> 00:13:07.825
We saw it happen.

227
00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:08.635
What?

228
00:13:08.635 --> 00:13:10.095
We're not lying.

229
00:13:10.095 --> 00:13:14.485
When we came to the terrace,
Kajiki-san tripped and fell.

230
00:13:23.415 --> 00:13:25.595
He fell from here?

231
00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:27.245
It seems that way.

232
00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:30.155
You and Kajiki-san were drinking here?

233
00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:31.055
Yes.

234
00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:33.255
How much did you drink?

235
00:13:33.475 --> 00:13:35.375
I didn't have that much.

236
00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:39.405
But he had enough to get
drunk and fall asleep.

237
00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:41.135
Look at this.

238
00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:43.135
A phone?

239
00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:46.645
That must be Kohei-san's.

240
00:13:46.915 --> 00:13:49.705
What's the victim's phone doing here?

241
00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:51.455
I figured it out.

242
00:13:52.295 --> 00:13:53.975
Figured out what?

243
00:13:53.975 --> 00:13:57.275
Why Kohei-san fell.

244
00:13:57.525 --> 00:13:58.715
Seriously?

245
00:13:58.715 --> 00:14:03.655
Yes. Kohei-san received a call after
getting drunk and falling sleep.

246
00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:10.645
Woken by his ringtone, he hurriedly
tried to answer his phone.

247
00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:14.545
However, his hand slipped,
and he dropped his phone.

248
00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:19.635
He got up to collect his
phone from around the edge,

249
00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:22.175
but because he was drunk, he tripped.

250
00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:25.685
Because the railing he
grabbed onto was rotten,

251
00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:28.555
he unfortunately fell from the terrace.

252
00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:36.855
Based on the victim's blood alcohol
concentration, we know he was drunk.

253
00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:41.695
It's possible he tripped on this step, too.

254
00:14:43.605 --> 00:14:46.295
It's my fault for leaving him alone.

255
00:14:48.615 --> 00:14:50.765
It's not your fault, Tomoko-san.

256
00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.705
That's right. It was an accident.

257
00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:55.315
I'm sorry. Thank you.

258
00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:57.215
What's this?

259
00:14:57.905 --> 00:14:59.965
Looks like a contact lens.

260
00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:03.155
It must've been the victim's.

261
00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:06.845
The body only had a contact in one eye.

262
00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:10.005
Maybe he dropped it when he rubbed his eyes.

263
00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:11.855
Probably.

264
00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:14.875
Since we haven't found anything suspicious,

265
00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:17.195
it seems likely that his
death was accidental.

266
00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:22.115
What are you doing, Genta-kun?

267
00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:24.995
Sorry. I was thirsty.

268
00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:27.185
Don't worry about it.

269
00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:35.295
I'll get something to wipe it up.

270
00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:48.495
I see. So that's how it is.

271
00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:50.885
Hey, Professor.

272
00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:52.935
What is it?

273
00:15:55.825 --> 00:15:58.435
We'll be leaving now.

274
00:15:58.435 --> 00:16:00.305
Wait one minute.

275
00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:03.115
What is it, Agasa-san?

276
00:16:03.115 --> 00:16:05.325
This wasn't an accident.

277
00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:09.275
Kajiki-san didn't fall by accident.

278
00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:12.835
He was made to do so.

279
00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:15.275
You're saying he was murdered?

280
00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:16.335
That's right.

281
00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:19.335
Look closely at his phone.

282
00:16:19.575 --> 00:16:23.115
There isn't a scratch on it even
though it was dropped on the ground.

283
00:16:23.605 --> 00:16:26.845
There aren't any dents or scratches.

284
00:16:27.175 --> 00:16:32.425
Isn't it possible that Kajiki-san's
phone was on the ground near the railing

285
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.855
not because he dropped it, but
because someone put it there?

286
00:16:37.355 --> 00:16:39.105
Someone?

287
00:16:39.105 --> 00:16:41.105
Who do you mean?

288
00:16:41.575 --> 00:16:45.755
There's only one person who
had full access to this house.

289
00:16:46.835 --> 00:16:51.375
Even if she left his phone by the railing,

290
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:55.205
surely that wasn't enough to make him fall.

291
00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:58.565
That's not the only thing she did.

292
00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:06.215
She used an illusion to make
Kajiki-san trip and fall.

293
00:17:06.215 --> 00:17:09.475
An illusion? What illusion?

294
00:17:09.955 --> 00:17:14.225
She made his phone appear to be
floating in front of the step.

295
00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:15.915
His phone?

296
00:17:15.915 --> 00:17:18.225
Is that possible?

297
00:17:18.965 --> 00:17:24.975
I'll recreate it for you using this
spray bottle that was in the hallway.

298
00:17:24.975 --> 00:17:26.755
A-A spray bottle?

299
00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:30.865
First, place the phone on
the step near the edge.

300
00:17:31.455 --> 00:17:36.695
Then use this to wet the
floor away from the phone.

301
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:41.755
You're right. It looks like
the phone is floating.

302
00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:43.265
I see.

303
00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:48.235
When the drunk victim saw this, even
if he thought it seemed strange...

304
00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:53.355
He might accept it as the truth
without thinking too hard about it.

305
00:17:54.505 --> 00:17:55.695
Right?

306
00:17:55.695 --> 00:18:00.775
But the key to this illusion isn't that
the phone appeared to be floating,

307
00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:05.015
but that the phone appeared
to be in front of the step.

308
00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:08.255
What do you mean?

309
00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:11.785
In other words, woken
by his phone's ringtone,

310
00:18:12.045 --> 00:18:14.285
because of the illusion,

311
00:18:14.285 --> 00:18:20.295
Kohei-san thought he could reach
his phone before he hit the step.

312
00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:26.155
Believing he was safe, he went to
pick up his phone without much care.

313
00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:31.055
But his phone was actually
on top of the step.

314
00:18:31.055 --> 00:18:35.305
He misjudged the situation and tripped on
the step before he could reach his phone

315
00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:41.095
and fell from the terrace.

316
00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:46.055
Because this illusion vanishes
once the ground dries,

317
00:18:46.055 --> 00:18:49.215
it also has the benefit of leaving no trace.

318
00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:50.325
I see.

319
00:18:50.695 --> 00:18:54.755
The railing was probably rotted beforehand

320
00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:56.875
and made to break at the slightest touch.

321
00:18:57.295 --> 00:19:00.335
Do you have any proof?

322
00:19:00.965 --> 00:19:02.335
Of course.

323
00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:05.335
What proof is there?

324
00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:10.715
Kajiki-san used foundation to
cover his wrinkles, didn't he?

325
00:19:11.295 --> 00:19:14.295
A contact was missing from the body,

326
00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:17.165
but there were no signs that
he rubbed around his eyes.

327
00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:23.345
However, there was something that looked
like fingerprints on his upper and lower eyelids.

328
00:19:23.975 --> 00:19:26.735
We did find those.

329
00:19:27.075 --> 00:19:32.125
No one would open their eyes to
remove just one of their contacts.

330
00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:37.575
It's only natural to assume someone
opened them for him and removed one.

331
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:42.165
And when Genta-kun spilled the water earlier,

332
00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:45.325
you changed your mind about removing
your handkerchief from your pocket.

333
00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:51.255
Perhaps the foundation you wiped from your
fingers is still on that handkerchief.

334
00:19:51.765 --> 00:19:54.135
But why would she do that?

335
00:19:54.455 --> 00:19:58.665
Because a large difference in acuity between
your two eyes disrupts your depth perception,

336
00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:00.865
increasing your risk of falling.

337
00:20:00.865 --> 00:20:02.885
When combined with the illusion,

338
00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:06.755
it became extremely likely that
Kohei-san would trip over the step.

339
00:20:07.445 --> 00:20:11.985
There's most likely foundation
on Komori-san's handkerchief

340
00:20:11.985 --> 00:20:17.655
and the phone used to call Kajiki-san's
somewhere in this house.

341
00:20:18.315 --> 00:20:21.785
Komori-san, do you have anything to say?

342
00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:27.745
And could we examine your handkerchief
and the inside of your house?

343
00:20:30.085 --> 00:20:31.795
It was going so well, too.

344
00:20:32.715 --> 00:20:33.975
Tomoko-san?

345
00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:35.305
Stay away from me!

346
00:20:35.605 --> 00:20:37.995
Tomoko-san, what's gotten into you?

347
00:20:38.475 --> 00:20:42.995
You've ruined my masterful performance.

348
00:20:42.995 --> 00:20:47.475
I hate little kids like you!

349
00:20:48.075 --> 00:20:52.355
So you were using the
children from the start.

350
00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:54.225
That's right.

351
00:20:54.225 --> 00:20:58.695
He said in a magazine interview
that he liked kids.

352
00:20:59.285 --> 00:21:04.105
In order to catch a big fish, you
need to catch some little ones first.

353
00:21:04.105 --> 00:21:06.205
Hey, check this out!

354
00:21:06.205 --> 00:21:08.705
I-I-In this room...

355
00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:13.155
What is all this?

356
00:21:14.225 --> 00:21:18.715
Surely not all of them, right?

357
00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:23.335
My plans were ruined because of you.

358
00:21:23.335 --> 00:21:27.725
Komori Tomoko-san, you can tell
us the rest at the station.

359
00:21:28.665 --> 00:21:31.235
I'll tell you,

360
00:21:32.055 --> 00:21:36.455
but I doubt you'll understand.

361
00:23:03.395 --> 00:23:05.655
What an unpleasant case.

362
00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:10.205
It seems like she was committing
the same crime over and over.

363
00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:13.215
She was an insane criminal.

364
00:23:13.215 --> 00:23:16.215
I suppose you can't judge
a person by their looks.

365
00:23:16.215 --> 00:23:20.265
Hey, I wonder what she's doing.

366
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:24.145
Maybe she's rescuing a cat.

367
00:23:24.145 --> 00:23:26.345
But I don't see any sign of a cat.

368
00:23:26.725 --> 00:23:30.355
Let's go ask her what she's doing.

369
00:23:30.705 --> 00:23:32.175
You're right.

370
00:23:32.175 --> 00:23:36.875
There must be some reason a
woman is climbing a tree alone.

371
00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:38.355
Don't.

372
00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:40.525
But aren't you curious?

373
00:23:40.525 --> 00:23:41.725
I am!

374
00:23:41.725 --> 00:23:43.115
Let's go check it out!

375
00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:44.905
Hey!

376
00:23:49.815 --> 00:23:51.385
They're already gone.

377
00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:52.285
They sure are.

378
00:23:55.835 --> 00:23:57.125
Wow!

379
00:23:57.445 --> 00:24:00.635
This is called glamping
instead of camping, isn't it?

380
00:24:01.285 --> 00:24:04.925
He's dressed like a woman, has
sloppy scribbles on his face,

381
00:24:04.925 --> 00:24:08.635
a crab leg in his mouth,
and a note in his hand.

382
00:24:08.835 --> 00:24:10.515
I didn't do this.

383
00:24:11.895 --> 00:24:13.725
There's more.

384
00:24:15.355 --> 00:24:18.445
Now I'm ready to go.

385
00:24:18.445 --> 00:24:18.975
The Glamping Mystery

386
00:24:18.975 --> 00:24:22.865
The next episode of Conan
is "The Glamping Mystery!"
The Glamping Mystery

387
00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:24.379
The Glamping Mystery

388
00:24:24.908 --> 00:24:26.938
Next Conan's hint!

389
00:24:26.938 --> 00:24:28.368
Crab!

390
00:24:29.328 --> 00:24:30.358
Don't miss the next episode.
What's glamping?

391
00:24:30.358 --> 00:24:31.038
Glamorous camping.

392
00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:32.038
I wanna go!

393
00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:33.908
Something will definitely happen, so no.
Don't miss the next episode.

394
00:24:33.908 --> 00:24:34.328
Don't miss the next episode.
