1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.340
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.540
-I'm here. -What?

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.940
Hey, Ran!

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.140
What do you mean you'll be sleeping over at school tonight?

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.740
Sorry. The karate championship is drawing near,

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.740
so everyone's pumped up.

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.840
Since there's no school tomorrow,

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.840
we decided to stay overnight and practice.

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.040
We just got permission from our teacher.

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.940
Hey, hey. What about our dinner?

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm so hungry, I could collapse any minute.

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.840
Just go to Poirot downstairs.

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.440
Get your breakfast there too.

14
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.940
-Hey. Listen. -All right,

15
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.640
I'll be back at noon tomorrow.

16
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.640
So take care of Conan for me.

17
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.640
Wait.

18
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.740
So said to eat at Poirot for dinner.

19
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.140
Guess we'll be having boxed meals

20
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.340
from a convenience store tonight.

21
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.940
Because today, Poirot is...

22
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.940
"We'll be closed from 4th to 5th due to circumstances. - Poirot's owner"

23
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.240
That's right, Poirot's owner.

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240
He did say he'd invited the neighborhood association guys

25
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.740
to a hot spring trip today.

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.940
I know. There's that Iroha Zusi.

27
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.340
"Iroha Zusi"

28
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.340
"Closed today - Iroha Zusi"

29
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.140
And they're closed too?

30
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440
Looks like he invited a lot of people.

31
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.140
Since there are a lot of shops with their lights off.

32
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.140
Oh, no.

33
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.740
Every single eatery in the neighborhood is blacked out.

34
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
As it is, there won't be food delivery tool.

35
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.540
Just in case, I bought the flyers

36
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.340
from all kinds of eating places that were in our mailbox.

37
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.540
Shall we try them?

38
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.740
Anything that looks good?

39
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.040
Specialty Pizza "Colossoo",

40
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040
Miso cutlet "Tsubouchi",

41
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.940
Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki "Kondo"...

42
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.340
None of which I'm in the mood for.

43
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.940
It's a bit of a distance,

44
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.640
but why don't we give this a try?

45
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.840
If all cases were men,

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.740
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

47
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.340
The good old style ramen shop,

48
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.140
I can feel something reeking around there.

49
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

52
00:03:55.077 --> 00:04:00.277
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 1)"

53
00:04:00.277 --> 00:04:01.677
"Delicious"

54
00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:03.077
"Ramen"

55
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:04.477
"To Die For"

56
00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:09.377
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

57
00:04:09.377 --> 00:04:13.177
It's quite a venerable shop isn't it?

58
00:04:13.177 --> 00:04:16.277
The picture on the flyer was a lot nicer, right?

59
00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:18.377
Should we look for another shop?

60
00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:19.777
Idiot.

61
00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:23.677
This kind of unvarnished shop is what we call a "hidden gem",

62
00:04:23.677 --> 00:04:25.977
it must be super tasty and well-loved.

63
00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:27.977
Plus, on a cold day like this,

64
00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:30.577
it's best to eat some ramen and warm up.

65
00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.577
Darn it.

66
00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.177
Guess you have a point.

67
00:04:43.077 --> 00:04:44.077
Welcome.

68
00:04:47.377 --> 00:04:48.577
It's cold.

69
00:04:50.877 --> 00:04:53.877
-Chilly today, ain't it? -Yes.

70
00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:57.377
And no other customers.

71
00:04:58.977 --> 00:05:02.477
Sir, anywhere but that seat please.

72
00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:04.577
It's the seat of one of our loyal customers.

73
00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:07.977
"Katsumasa Ogura (49)" -Well, although he was a loyal customer,

74
00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:10.477
he passed away last month.

75
00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.577
It's just my desire to reserve the seat

76
00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:15.877
in memory of him until the 49 days of mourning are up.

77
00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:18.477
If you say so...

78
00:05:18.477 --> 00:05:20.477
Sorry about that.

79
00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:24.077
So that's why flowers have been left on the table.

80
00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:30.677
A customer... Two even?

81
00:05:30.677 --> 00:05:33.277
Guess I won our bet then, Sayo.

82
00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:34.477
Geez.

83
00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:37.477
"Sayo Ohasi (28)" -My part-time pay is low enough already.

84
00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:39.577
Cut me loose once in a while.

85
00:05:39.577 --> 00:05:42.677
Anyway, give our guests some water.

86
00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:43.677
Fine.

87
00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:48.477
What kind of bet were you talking about?

88
00:05:48.477 --> 00:05:50.877
It's about whether the number of gusts today

89
00:05:50.877 --> 00:05:52.977
would go into double digits or not.

90
00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:58.177
Dinner time's almost over,

91
00:05:58.177 --> 00:06:00.777
and we just finally helped them make it ten customers on the day?

92
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.277
May I take your orders please?

93
00:06:03.277 --> 00:06:04.777
Any recommendations?

94
00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:07.377
Your best bet is, our pride and joy,

95
00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:10.777
that's so delicious it's to die for is "The Death Lord Ramen."

96
00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:12.077
We do have the plain miso or

97
00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:14.777
dipping ramen on the menu just in case.

98
00:06:14.777 --> 00:06:17.477
But if you somehow want anything other than...

99
00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.277
"The Death Lord Ramen."

100
00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.177
We'll still serve you as you wish.

101
00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:26.977
Well, then w'll try some of that Death Lord ramen.

102
00:06:26.977 --> 00:06:28.377
Me too.

103
00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:30.777
Two orders of the Death Lord ramen.

104
00:06:30.777 --> 00:06:32.077
All right.

105
00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.377
So cold.

106
00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:43.077
It's a good thing

107
00:06:43.077 --> 00:06:45.177
we chose ramen like pops suggested.

108
00:06:45.177 --> 00:06:47.577
Scumbag, what are you doing here?

109
00:06:47.577 --> 00:06:51.277
Screw off. We don't serve ramen to the likes of you.

110
00:06:54.277 --> 00:06:57.477
What's with using that manner of speech to a customer?

111
00:06:57.477 --> 00:06:59.777
"Tokumori Saizu (51)" -I made a special effort to come

112
00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:01.777
to this seedy shop where business is so slow,

113
00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:05.777
just to give you fine folks some much needed profit.

114
00:07:05.777 --> 00:07:07.077
We're losing customers

115
00:07:07.077 --> 00:07:11.177
only because those young jackasses from your place

116
00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:13.677
are always causing trouble in my shop.

117
00:07:13.677 --> 00:07:17.777
My bad, they're all brainless, energetic grunts.

118
00:07:17.777 --> 00:07:20.577
But we should've already properly compensated you

119
00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:23.377
for the tableware my boys broke.

120
00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.477
That's not the problem!

121
00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:28.977
Well, I did give these boys an earful.

122
00:07:28.977 --> 00:07:31.877
Telling them they should've made sure

123
00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:34.277
to seriously hurt the owner while they're at it.

124
00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:37.077
The did you say?

125
00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:39.777
I'm joking, joking.

126
00:07:39.777 --> 00:07:42.077
All right, then...

127
00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:43.777
That seat...

128
00:07:43.777 --> 00:07:46.177
Oops, my bad.

129
00:07:46.177 --> 00:07:48.177
I knocked it over.

130
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:49.577
Wipe it for me, will you?

131
00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:51.977
You're the one who spilled it,

132
00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:53.277
so wipe it up yourself.

133
00:07:54.777 --> 00:07:56.777
My, what an insolent shop.

134
00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.777
It's your fault for putting out shabby flowers

135
00:07:58.777 --> 00:08:00.877
as decoration in a spot like this.

136
00:08:03.977 --> 00:08:05.577
Your order?

137
00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.977
If you're not ordering anything, please go home.

138
00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:10.177
Immediately!

139
00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:14.877
Then, I'll have that "so good it's die for" thing.

140
00:08:18.577 --> 00:08:19.677
Well...

141
00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:24.477
Have you made up your mind yet, master?

142
00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:25.877
Well...

143
00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:28.477
If you ask me, I won't sell this shop.

144
00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:30.677
Since we and the Haido Shopping Street proprietors

145
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.677
have joined forces

146
00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:36.277
and made an unwavering pact recently.

147
00:08:36.277 --> 00:08:39.077
A great example of "ignorance is bliss".

148
00:08:39.077 --> 00:08:43.077
Your own shop is being called the black sheep, you know?

149
00:08:43.077 --> 00:08:44.277
What?

150
00:08:44.277 --> 00:08:48.177
Before I came in here,

151
00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:50.577
I got a haircut from Barber Taninaka next door, and...

152
00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:54.177
The owner of that barbershop was complaining too.

153
00:08:54.177 --> 00:08:56.677
He was saying he'd like for this beat up ramen shop

154
00:08:56.677 --> 00:08:59.277
to be run out of this stylish shopping street

155
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.977
since it just didn't fit.

156
00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:03.577
Is that for real?

157
00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:07.177
My, spewing nonsense, are you?

158
00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:11.677
I only said, "If he remodeled once in a while,

159
00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:15.377
his business would've been more prosperous."

160
00:09:15.377 --> 00:09:16.777
"Atsusi Taninaka (47)" -My shop and yours

161
00:09:16.777 --> 00:09:20.177
opened on this shopping street at the same time twenty years ago.

162
00:09:20.177 --> 00:09:22.177
My shop has remodeled three times already,

163
00:09:22.177 --> 00:09:26.177
yet this place has been the same, right?

164
00:09:26.177 --> 00:09:27.277
Yes.

165
00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:29.977
I've been thinking about doing it,

166
00:09:29.977 --> 00:09:33.177
but things are a bit tight over here.

167
00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.277
I understand perfectly.

168
00:09:35.277 --> 00:09:37.777
Instigating a falling out between friends

169
00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.877
in order to wreck this shopping district

170
00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:42.577
was Mr. Land Shark's aim all along.

171
00:09:45.077 --> 00:09:47.277
I'll have the Death Lord ramen.

172
00:09:47.277 --> 00:09:48.477
All right.

173
00:09:50.877 --> 00:09:53.477
Here. Thanks for waiting.

174
00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:56.777
Your Death Lord ramen.

175
00:09:58.277 --> 00:09:59.877
What is this?

176
00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:02.177
Bamboo shoots are piled sky high?

177
00:10:02.177 --> 00:10:03.577
I see.

178
00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:06.677
It's a pun on "Enma" (Death Lord) and "Menma" (Bamboo shoots).

179
00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:09.577
Let's see... the chopsticks are...

180
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.677
Mister, could you pass those chopsticks?

181
00:10:14.677 --> 00:10:16.777
Here you are.

182
00:10:16.777 --> 00:10:18.077
Thanks.

183
00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:20.977
Well, anyway, give it a try.

184
00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:23.677
Yes.

185
00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:25.077
Okay, I'll get right to it.

186
00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:34.377
Let's eat.

187
00:10:36.577 --> 00:10:38.377
Here goes...

188
00:10:49.677 --> 00:10:51.677
-So Good! -So Good!

189
00:10:51.677 --> 00:10:54.777
-I've never tasted anything like this before. -Yes.

190
00:10:54.777 --> 00:10:56.377
Right? Right?

191
00:10:56.377 --> 00:10:59.077
These bamboo shoots are especially delicious.

192
00:10:59.077 --> 00:11:00.477
Right, right.

193
00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:03.477
The secret to its tastiness is in these bamboo shoots.

194
00:11:03.477 --> 00:11:06.177
The recipe is a trade secret, of course.

195
00:11:06.177 --> 00:11:07.777
You're right.

196
00:11:08.777 --> 00:11:12.477
I could get used to this flavor all the time.

197
00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:14.377
Thank you.

198
00:11:15.477 --> 00:11:19.377
We should invite Ran, Dr Agasa and the others here next time.

199
00:11:20.377 --> 00:11:24.077
A run-down shop with a top-notch taste?

200
00:11:24.077 --> 00:11:27.177
Guess it won't be closing down anytime soon.

201
00:11:27.177 --> 00:11:28.377
No.

202
00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:31.277
Cheap, fast and tasty is our motto.

203
00:11:31.277 --> 00:11:34.177
We're definitely going to keep on track.

204
00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:36.677
Well, that's good to hear.

205
00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:40.077
In contrast, my company is going down in flames.

206
00:11:40.077 --> 00:11:42.877
It makes me feel as if I want to die.

207
00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:47.177
Then, why don't you fold up your fishy business,

208
00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:49.377
and start a new trade instead?

209
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.877
It's not that easy to make it in this world.

210
00:11:56.977 --> 00:11:59.577
Mister, you're left-handed?

211
00:11:59.577 --> 00:12:00.677
Yes.

212
00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:05.277
But earlier you wiped up the water on the table using your right hand?

213
00:12:05.277 --> 00:12:07.677
I was corrected by my parents when I was a kid,

214
00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:09.577
so I'm ambidextrous.

215
00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:14.277
But I still use my left hand whenever I eat,

216
00:12:14.277 --> 00:12:16.277
or else I feel uncomfortable.

217
00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:23.877
"Ramen so good it's die for"?

218
00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:28.077
If only someone could die after eating this for my sake,

219
00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:31.677
then this shop would go out of business immediately.

220
00:12:34.777 --> 00:12:38.777
Why don't try poisoning this stuff?

221
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:41.777
Look here you.

222
00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:43.077
I've been listening this whole time,

223
00:12:43.077 --> 00:12:46.077
but you're just spewing bull shit and being disprespectful.

224
00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:50.777
Darn.

225
00:12:52.977 --> 00:12:54.977
Hey. Let's take it outside.

226
00:12:54.977 --> 00:12:57.977
I'll give you a piece of my mind.

227
00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.377
Sir!

228
00:13:05.277 --> 00:13:08.077
Hey, are you even listening? Hey?

229
00:13:35.377 --> 00:13:36.577
Call an ambulance!

230
00:13:36.577 --> 00:13:39.277
Hurry, call an ambulance. Hurry!

231
00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.277
Okay.

232
00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:44.277
Screw him.

233
00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:45.477
Idiot.

234
00:13:45.477 --> 00:13:48.277
Do you think we're going to fall for that same trick, again?

235
00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:51.377
What? Hold on, what are you saying?

236
00:13:51.377 --> 00:13:53.877
I know this guy's game.

237
00:13:53.877 --> 00:13:55.877
But he's just faking a collapse in my shop

238
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:59.277
to raise a big fuss about having gotten food poisoning.

239
00:13:59.277 --> 00:14:00.777
What?

240
00:14:00.777 --> 00:14:03.277
Taninaka, give me a hand.

241
00:14:03.277 --> 00:14:06.877
We'll throw this punk out onto the street and wake him up.

242
00:14:06.877 --> 00:14:08.177
Sure.

243
00:14:08.177 --> 00:14:09.877
You can't touch him!

244
00:14:11.077 --> 00:14:12.777
It'll be best if everyone returned

245
00:14:12.777 --> 00:14:16.577
to where they originally were without touching anything.

246
00:14:18.677 --> 00:14:21.277
Also, in addition to the ambulance,

247
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.277
call the police as well.

248
00:14:22.277 --> 00:14:24.177
The police?

249
00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:25.777
This man...

250
00:14:25.777 --> 00:14:27.877
I'm pretty sure he'd already dead.

251
00:14:37.882 --> 00:14:39.182
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

252
00:14:39.182 --> 00:14:42.882
"Ramen so good it's to die for"?

253
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.682
And immediately after eating it,

254
00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:47.782
he collapsed in agency and passed away?

255
00:14:47.782 --> 00:14:48.782
Yes.

256
00:14:48.782 --> 00:14:51.782
Well, the ramen certainly was good, but...

257
00:14:51.782 --> 00:14:53.982
Who would've thought he'd really die for it?

258
00:14:53.982 --> 00:14:55.482
Don't be stupid.

259
00:14:55.482 --> 00:14:58.182
People don't just drop dead from food that's too delicious.

260
00:15:00.082 --> 00:15:03.282
And? What's the victim's name?

261
00:15:03.282 --> 00:15:06.082
Tokumori Saizu, 51 years old.

262
00:15:06.082 --> 00:15:07.782
He was apparently the president

263
00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.082
of the real estate business he managed in Haido City.

264
00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:12.482
It seems he had wanted to buy up

265
00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:14.482
and raze the entire Haido Shopping Street,

266
00:15:14.482 --> 00:15:18.582
and build a large shopping mall instead.

267
00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:23.482
The people of this area considered him to be a major nuisance.

268
00:15:23.482 --> 00:15:25.782
He was considered a nuisance?

269
00:15:25.782 --> 00:15:29.182
Yes, in order to destroy this shopping street,

270
00:15:29.182 --> 00:15:32.082
it appears that he would frequently use his employees

271
00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:33.982
to purposely disrupt the businesses.

272
00:15:33.982 --> 00:15:34.982
Yes.

273
00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:37.482
When they came here,

274
00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:39.282
they'd find some reason to pick on one of our customers

275
00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:40.982
and start a fight.

276
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:44.782
Can't even count how many of my ramen bowls they've broken.

277
00:15:44.782 --> 00:15:48.382
It was the same at your shop, wasn't it, Taninaka?

278
00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:49.582
Yes.

279
00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:51.082
Purposely shifting while getting a shave

280
00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:53.782
and causing their cheeks to get cut

281
00:15:53.782 --> 00:15:55.082
and then raising a huge fuss

282
00:15:55.082 --> 00:15:57.982
and demanding we pay for the medical bill, it's their rutine.

283
00:15:57.982 --> 00:15:59.882
How did it go today?

284
00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:03.682
Saizu said he had gone to your shop to get a haircut

285
00:16:03.682 --> 00:16:07.582
before coming here to eat ramen, right?

286
00:16:07.582 --> 00:16:10.282
Yes, today, it went fine.

287
00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:13.682
So this guy was a so-called land shark?

288
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.882
Yes, it seems the whole shopping street got together

289
00:16:17.882 --> 00:16:20.682
and planned to file a lawsuit over his outrageous behavior, but...

290
00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:23.782
The attorney representing them died last month,

291
00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.582
and the lawsuit was dropped.

292
00:16:25.582 --> 00:16:27.282
He didn't just die.

293
00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:30.982
You could say he was murdered.

294
00:16:30.982 --> 00:16:34.782
Because my dad trying to stop a fight here

295
00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:36.382
while eating his ramen,

296
00:16:36.382 --> 00:16:38.182
and a heart attack struck him due to his chronic disease.

297
00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:41.082
He was taken to the hospital and died there.

298
00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:45.082
By "dad", you mean you're the attorney's daughter?

299
00:16:45.082 --> 00:16:47.082
-That's right. -From when she was little,

300
00:16:47.082 --> 00:16:51.482
that attorney would often bring her along to this shop.

301
00:16:51.482 --> 00:16:55.682
She used to say she'd also open a ramen shop once she grew up.

302
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.882
But I never thought she'd really come

303
00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:01.882
and ask me for any job, even a part-time one.

304
00:17:01.882 --> 00:17:04.282
Incidentally, what was your dad's chronic disease?

305
00:17:04.282 --> 00:17:06.182
Hypertension.

306
00:17:06.182 --> 00:17:07.882
His death of cerebral hemorrhage

307
00:17:07.882 --> 00:17:09.482
was probably due to his over-agitation

308
00:17:09.482 --> 00:17:13.282
from dragged into the fight, the doctor said so.

309
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:16.982
But isn't it bad for people with high blood pressure to eat ramen?

310
00:17:16.982 --> 00:17:20.982
My father took medicine to control his blood pressure.

311
00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:22.082
And he was even told by his doctor

312
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:25.782
that it was okay to eat ramen as long as he didn't drink the soup.

313
00:17:25.782 --> 00:17:27.582
I understand.

314
00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:30.382
The victim's cause of death was poison, right?

315
00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:34.082
Yes. According to the coroner,

316
00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:35.782
he probably ingested the hydrocyanic poison

317
00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:39.482
through his mouth as he was eating ramen.

318
00:17:39.482 --> 00:17:40.582
So in short,

319
00:17:40.582 --> 00:17:43.382
having been in this shop at the time of the incident

320
00:17:43.382 --> 00:17:45.782
and possession sufficient motive,

321
00:17:45.782 --> 00:17:51.382
the three of you had the opportunity to poison the victim to death.

322
00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:53.682
Please wait a moment.

323
00:17:53.682 --> 00:17:55.182
Are you joking?

324
00:17:55.182 --> 00:17:58.282
Are you saying there was poison in our ramen?

325
00:17:58.282 --> 00:18:00.682
We shall investigate that now.

326
00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:04.982
So, if you all would submit to body searches

327
00:18:04.982 --> 00:18:07.582
and wait outside until we finish our investigation inside the shop.

328
00:18:07.582 --> 00:18:09.282
But...

329
00:18:09.282 --> 00:18:12.782
is it wise to restrict it to only the three of us?

330
00:18:12.782 --> 00:18:15.082
What do you mean?

331
00:18:15.082 --> 00:18:17.082
Before Saizu collapsed,

332
00:18:17.082 --> 00:18:21.382
that customer grabbed him by the collar.

333
00:18:21.382 --> 00:18:23.082
Me?

334
00:18:23.082 --> 00:18:24.582
That did happen.

335
00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:26.582
Is that really true?

336
00:18:28.682 --> 00:18:30.982
I was just thinking I'd give him a good talking

337
00:18:30.982 --> 00:18:32.782
to since he was talking nonsense.

338
00:18:32.782 --> 00:18:36.782
Then, you'll undergo a body search too, and then get out.

339
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.082
Yes, sir.

340
00:18:42.782 --> 00:18:44.782
Geez, on such a cold day,

341
00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:47.782
why did I have to be shut out too?

342
00:18:47.782 --> 00:18:51.482
Pops, do you know how ramen is made?

343
00:18:52.982 --> 00:18:55.782
Why don't you ask the expert for that sort of thing?

344
00:18:57.082 --> 00:18:58.882
But...

345
00:18:58.882 --> 00:19:00.282
I see.

346
00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:03.582
If he had laced poison somewhere during the cooking process,

347
00:19:03.582 --> 00:19:06.082
there's no way he'd answer you.

348
00:19:06.082 --> 00:19:07.982
Let's see.

349
00:19:07.982 --> 00:19:11.382
What I usually see on TV is to boil the noodles

350
00:19:11.382 --> 00:19:13.382
upon receiving an order from the customer.

351
00:19:13.382 --> 00:19:17.382
And then add the sauce and stuff like seasoning in the ramen bowl.

352
00:19:17.382 --> 00:19:19.782
Then, after that was...

353
00:19:19.782 --> 00:19:22.582
You'd put soup into the bowl.

354
00:19:24.882 --> 00:19:28.282
Next, you drain the noodles and put them into the bowl.

355
00:19:28.282 --> 00:19:31.682
And then finish it off with garnishes such as roast pork,

356
00:19:31.682 --> 00:19:33.082
eggs, bamboo shoots and long green onions.

357
00:19:33.082 --> 00:19:34.582
Well, in the case of my shop,

358
00:19:34.582 --> 00:19:37.782
Sayo is the one who does the garnishing.

359
00:19:37.782 --> 00:19:39.982
Yes.

360
00:19:39.982 --> 00:19:42.682
In short, if it had been you or Sayo,

361
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:46.082
either one of you could have laced it with poison at your leisure, right?

362
00:19:46.082 --> 00:19:48.282
Well, I guess that'd be the case.

363
00:19:48.282 --> 00:19:51.282
But we never laced anything with poison.

364
00:19:51.282 --> 00:19:53.082
Really?

365
00:19:53.082 --> 00:19:56.282
Never!

366
00:19:56.282 --> 00:19:58.182
Say, say, mister.

367
00:19:59.182 --> 00:20:02.682
Did you eat ramen with the late Saizu often?

368
00:20:02.682 --> 00:20:05.282
Well... every once in a while.

369
00:20:05.282 --> 00:20:09.382
In that case, is there anything Saizu really likes

370
00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:12.982
that he'd definitely eat up before he even touched the noodles?

371
00:20:12.982 --> 00:20:15.482
Like bamboo shoots or eggs...

372
00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:16.882
Beats me...

373
00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.482
I've never actually looked at how he ate.

374
00:20:19.482 --> 00:20:23.882
Then, what about any habits he has when he eats ramen?

375
00:20:23.882 --> 00:20:25.082
Habits?

376
00:20:25.082 --> 00:20:28.082
Like, I was thinking if he always touches something out of habit,

377
00:20:28.082 --> 00:20:30.982
it'd be easy to just apply the poison there.

378
00:20:30.982 --> 00:20:34.382
Why are you asking me that?

379
00:20:34.382 --> 00:20:36.682
Because you were the only one, mister...

380
00:20:36.682 --> 00:20:40.982
The only person who didn't get close to Saizu nor Saizu's ramen.

381
00:20:40.982 --> 00:20:42.882
You're right.

382
00:20:42.882 --> 00:20:46.482
Since you guys were sitting in the seats between me and him.

383
00:20:46.482 --> 00:20:51.382
Yes, and if I recall, the closest you ever got to Saizu,

384
00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:54.582
was when you hold out the chopstick stand to us,

385
00:20:54.582 --> 00:20:57.582
but Saizu didn't use those chopsticks at all.

386
00:20:57.582 --> 00:20:58.682
Yes.

387
00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:02.982
But, I wonder why we didn't have

388
00:21:02.982 --> 00:21:05.082
any chopsticks in the stand in front of us?

389
00:21:05.082 --> 00:21:07.082
Because there was a customer who dropped that stand,

390
00:21:07.082 --> 00:21:09.882
and scattered the chopsticks all over the floor.

391
00:21:09.882 --> 00:21:11.982
-What? -And before I could refill it

392
00:21:11.982 --> 00:21:14.882
with some replacement chopsticks, you guys came.

393
00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:19.182
Unsurprisingly, the customer was one of Saizu's subordinates.

394
00:21:19.182 --> 00:21:21.882
We made sure to charge him for the chopsticks.

395
00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:25.582
Then, is refilling the chopsticks your duty, Sayo?

396
00:21:25.582 --> 00:21:28.482
Yes, that's me all right.

397
00:21:28.482 --> 00:21:32.082
But, I never touched the chopsticks that man used.

398
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:35.382
Since that seat was my dad's reserved seat.

399
00:21:35.382 --> 00:21:38.282
There weren't really any customers who sat there.

400
00:21:38.282 --> 00:21:42.282
Then, that means the loyal customer who died last month was indeed...

401
00:21:42.282 --> 00:21:45.282
Yeah, it was that attorney.

402
00:21:45.282 --> 00:21:48.682
Saizu sat in that seat without taking no for answer,

403
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.282
does he always do that?

404
00:21:51.382 --> 00:21:53.782
Almost always.

405
00:21:53.782 --> 00:21:56.082
After he found out it was the lawyer's seat,

406
00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:59.282
he'd purposely sit there as a form of harassment.

407
00:21:59.282 --> 00:22:02.882
In short Saizu sitting at that seat

408
00:22:02.882 --> 00:22:05.482
was something that could've been foreseen to some extent.

409
00:22:05.482 --> 00:22:07.082
If that's the case...

410
00:22:15.682 --> 00:22:18.582
Among those three who were in the shop at that time

411
00:22:18.582 --> 00:22:22.182
and had the chance to poison Saizu.

412
00:22:22.182 --> 00:22:24.482
Who on earth did it?

413
00:23:45.682 --> 00:23:48.982
Then, I'll go back inside and continue with the investigation.

414
00:23:50.082 --> 00:23:51.582
Hold on, wait.

415
00:23:51.582 --> 00:23:54.982
I still have questions to ask you...

416
00:23:54.982 --> 00:23:58.382
Mr. Saizu did have someone pulling his strings.

417
00:23:58.382 --> 00:24:00.382
To apply poison to his own fingers,

418
00:24:00.382 --> 00:24:03.182
and then bring it to his mouth.

419
00:24:03.182 --> 00:24:07.382
Just as the culprit among us expected.

420
00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:11.382
Next Conan,

421
00:24:11.382 --> 00:24:15.282
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 2)"

422
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:18.251
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:18.251 --> 00:24:20.451
"The Glasses".

424
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:21.751
Conan, once you takes off your glasses,

425
00:24:21.751 --> 00:24:24.051
you just look like Shinichi when he was a child.

426
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:25.255
Indeed I am.
