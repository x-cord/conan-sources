1
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.966
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.866
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.566
An eerie villa with a story behind it.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.666
What is the silhouette that appears in the window that is closed off?

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.066
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.766
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.666
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:08.342
Sonoko.

9
00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:05.042
Stone-paper-scissors...

10
00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:09.442
Me, again?

11
00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:10.842
Sorry.

12
00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.542
Be patient for 10 minutes more.

13
00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:15.442
You didn't invite me here

14
00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:17.942
knowing I'm not good at playing stone-paper-scissors, did you?

15
00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:20.442
To make up for your efforts,

16
00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:24.042
I want you to make yourself at home later at the Suzuki family villa.

17
00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:26.942
Your villa?

18
00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:30.542
Wasn't it a pension owned by your sister's friend?

19
00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:33.942
Huh? Did I say that?

20
00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:35.842
Don't tell me that

21
00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:40.542
it's that villa where the murder of the bandaged man occurred?

22
00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:42.442
I still remember that case, too.

23
00:03:44.842 --> 00:03:47.342
No way! I'm going home!

24
00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:48.442
Impossible.

25
00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:50.242
You have no sense of direction, do you?

26
00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:51.342
But...

27
00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:55.642
I see why Sonoko sent the car back halfway

28
00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:58.442
and made us all walk the mountain road up to the villa.

29
00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:03.442
This way, Ran wouldn't be able to leave after getting scared.

30
00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.142
Sonoko, that fool.

31
00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:10.642
By the way, has the case been solved?

32
00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:14.242
Absolutely solved. Thanks to Deduction Queen Sonoko.

33
00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:16.542
Right, since that case,

34
00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:21.142
you've been solving cases like my dad, as if you were sleeping.

35
00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:25.642
And when I was assaulted by the Bandaged Man,

36
00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:27.842
Conan helped me out.

37
00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:32.942
So he was at the site, too.

38
00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:36.142
Well, I will tell you the details after we arrive at the villa.

39
00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:41.242
I can't believe it!

40
00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:42.542
The bridge!

41
00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:47.542
Don't tell me someone is up to no good again.

42
00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:52.542
No, it must have collapsed from the base.

43
00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.542
This is simply a cheat in construction work.

44
00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:56.242
Is it?

45
00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:58.242
But we're in trouble.

46
00:04:58.242 --> 00:05:00.442
We can't reach the villa.

47
00:05:00.442 --> 00:05:02.242
The car already left.

48
00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:05.342
My sister and the others will be coming, but that's tonight.

49
00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:07.342
Then, let's call them by cell phone.

50
00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:08.842
I'm sure they'll come right away.

51
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:10.442
Sorry,

52
00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:12.142
but this place is outside of the cell phone service range.

53
00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:13.942
No way.

54
00:05:13.942 --> 00:05:15.842
Then let's do this.

55
00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:18.942
Let's go to that villa and borrow the phone there.

56
00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:21.442
There may be someone inside.

57
00:05:24.642 --> 00:05:30.342
"Sealed Western-style Window (Part 1)"

58
00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:37.342
Looks like no one's home.

59
00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.042
Who are you people?

60
00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:55.142
Oh, you mean the bridge leading to that villa?

61
00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:56.942
Come to think of it, it's broken.

62
00:05:56.942 --> 00:06:01.042
Yes. I would like to use your phone and call someone to come pick us up.

63
00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:02.242
"Jun Makino (29)" -No problem.

64
00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:05.542
You can kill time here till they come.

65
00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:07.842
-Thank you very much. -Thank you very much.

66
00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:11.042
This is a very nice villa.

67
00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:15.642
Your remark should go to the rich man who built this.

68
00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:19.342
"Toru Tendou (30)" -We just beat down the price of it and got it.

69
00:06:19.342 --> 00:06:22.042
We're just ordinary citizens.

70
00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:23.342
You bought this for a cheap price?

71
00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:26.742
Yes. We're members of a band.

72
00:06:26.742 --> 00:06:28.742
In other words, musicians.

73
00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:33.242
I was looking for a place where I could write music and lyrics in peace.

74
00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:36.242
That was when we found this rarity.

75
00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:40.542
But it must've cost a lot, despite it being a good buy.

76
00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:43.042
No, it was really cheap.

77
00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:45.942
"Yoji Kuramoto (28)" -Something about this place having a story behind it.

78
00:06:45.942 --> 00:06:48.342
They were planning to demolish it if they couldn't sell it.

79
00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.542
-A story behind it? -A story behind it?

80
00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:52.642
Right.

81
00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:55.642
Originally, multimillionaire brothers seem to have built this place.

82
00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:57.642
They would bring their wives here around this time

83
00:06:57.642 --> 00:06:59.642
every year to avoid the heat.

84
00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:04.942
But one night, when it was raining heavily,

85
00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:07.842
the older brother started saying something strange.

86
00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:16.742
"I saw an unidentifiable devil come in from the window."

87
00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:17.942
A...

88
00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:19.142
Devil?

89
00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:31.942
After that, they nailed the window and closed it off immediately.

90
00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:37.742
No good. The devil has already...

91
00:07:40.142 --> 00:07:42.042
possessed this place!

92
00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:45.842
The older brother later refurbished this villa.

93
00:07:45.842 --> 00:07:49.142
He changed the floors, the wallpapers and renewed everything.

94
00:07:49.142 --> 00:07:52.242
But one year after the refurbishing the house,

95
00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:55.242
the first incident occurred.

96
00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.242
Incident?

97
00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:59.542
It involved the older brother's wife.

98
00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:02.242
While she was gardening,

99
00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:04.242
she saw something.

100
00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:06.942
From the window that was supposed to be sealed,

101
00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:08.342
something was staring at her.

102
00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:13.042
What was it?

103
00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:14.542
Was it the devil?

104
00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:15.742
Maybe.

105
00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:19.542
A few days later,

106
00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:22.442
she was almost possessed by the devil.

107
00:08:22.442 --> 00:08:26.042
She used a rope and killed herself in her room.

108
00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:29.642
Even the older brother, as if he were chasing after her,

109
00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:33.142
killed himself by jumping from the window of his room on the third floor.

110
00:08:33.142 --> 00:08:39.542
After that, only the younger brother and his wife stayed at this villa.

111
00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:41.742
This is why it was so cheap.

112
00:08:43.442 --> 00:08:44.842
Well?

113
00:08:44.842 --> 00:08:48.442
Don't you think this is a good place to create good music and lyrics?

114
00:08:48.442 --> 00:08:50.142
Yeah.

115
00:08:50.142 --> 00:08:53.142
Hey, hey. What kind of music is it?

116
00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:57.042
But does that window really unable to be opened?

117
00:08:57.042 --> 00:09:00.642
Go check it out yourself. Come.

118
00:09:07.642 --> 00:09:08.642
I see.

119
00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:10.842
The window has been nailed shut.

120
00:09:13.642 --> 00:09:15.342
It won't budge an inch.

121
00:09:15.342 --> 00:09:16.642
See?

122
00:09:16.642 --> 00:09:19.942
When we bought it, they told us that they would fix the window,

123
00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:23.042
but we left it as it is, because we thought it was a sheer waste.

124
00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:24.642
You should have had it fixed.

125
00:09:24.642 --> 00:09:26.542
Want to stay overnight?

126
00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:29.242
You may be able to see the devil.

127
00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:30.642
No, thank you.

128
00:09:30.642 --> 00:09:33.042
We just want to use your phone.

129
00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:36.242
I'm glad you all came back as we were leaving.

130
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:40.142
What? We went out to buy some food.

131
00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:43.142
But one person should have been here. Rinko.

132
00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:44.442
Rinko?

133
00:09:46.842 --> 00:09:48.342
"Rinko Honami (28)" -Hey.

134
00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:52.242
Can't you all be quiet around here?

135
00:09:52.242 --> 00:09:54.842
How can I write songs like this?

136
00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:58.042
That's Rinko.

137
00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:59.642
She uses the room next door.

138
00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:02.242
Since she came here, she has always been acting like that.

139
00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:03.642
Always irritated.

140
00:10:03.642 --> 00:10:07.942
We can't complain, because the life of our band "Dorcus"

141
00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:09.342
depends on the music she makes.

142
00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.342
What? Did you say "Dorcus"?

143
00:10:11.342 --> 00:10:12.942
I know you!

144
00:10:12.942 --> 00:10:15.342
You're well known among the Indies, aren't you?

145
00:10:15.342 --> 00:10:17.742
I even have one of your CDs!

146
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.242
Oh, thanks a lot.

147
00:10:20.242 --> 00:10:21.742
I wonder which way.

148
00:10:23.242 --> 00:10:25.342
Here you are.

149
00:10:25.342 --> 00:10:27.842
I finally talked to my sister.

150
00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:30.042
She told me she can get here in two hours or so and pick us up.

151
00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:31.642
Great!

152
00:10:31.642 --> 00:10:34.142
Okay. Then...

153
00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:36.942
Let's go out to the backyard while waiting for her, shall we?

154
00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:39.342
I want to see the window from outside.

155
00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:41.042
The window where the devil supposedly looked in through.

156
00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:46.142
The window is the fourth one from the right on the second floor.

157
00:10:46.142 --> 00:10:47.442
That one.

158
00:10:47.442 --> 00:10:50.442
From the outside, it looks like an ordinary window.

159
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:53.642
It doesn't look all that haunted.

160
00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:56.142
Was the devil really looking through the window?

161
00:10:56.142 --> 00:10:57.442
They say so.

162
00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:05.242
Look. There's a bird's nest up there.

163
00:11:05.242 --> 00:11:06.542
I see it, too.

164
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:08.642
Be careful, Conan.

165
00:11:09.842 --> 00:11:11.842
There's nothing inside.

166
00:11:11.842 --> 00:11:14.542
It doesn't look like birds built a nest here either.

167
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:20.042
But there is a white plate in here.

168
00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:23.142
Strange to find a plate in a birdhouse, isn't it?

169
00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:25.842
What? Let me see it.

170
00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:28.542
You'd better not, Eisuke.

171
00:11:30.342 --> 00:11:33.142
It hurts...

172
00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:35.542
You are really a klutz, aren't you?

173
00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:36.842
Are you okay?

174
00:11:38.342 --> 00:11:40.242
I guess I am okay.

175
00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:43.442
Now, let's move toward the terrace.

176
00:11:45.242 --> 00:11:46.742
What is it this time?

177
00:11:47.742 --> 00:11:48.842
What's that?

178
00:11:54.242 --> 00:11:55.642
Something's up there.

179
00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:59.942
Something was gazing at us from the sealed window!

180
00:11:59.942 --> 00:12:01.242
Come on.

181
00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:04.242
Did you hit your head or something when you fell down a while ago?

182
00:12:04.242 --> 00:12:06.342
No, I'm not lying!

183
00:12:06.342 --> 00:12:07.342
Conan?

184
00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:20.242
What's up, kid?

185
00:12:27.842 --> 00:12:30.042
It's completely sealed.

186
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:32.042
There are no traces of nails being removed either.

187
00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:35.942
Rinko.

188
00:12:35.942 --> 00:12:37.542
Hey, Rinko.

189
00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:39.242
Hurry and open the door.

190
00:12:39.242 --> 00:12:40.842
Rinko.

191
00:12:40.842 --> 00:12:43.942
What's going on?

192
00:12:43.942 --> 00:12:47.142
I bought a CD that Rinko asked me to buy for her,

193
00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:49.742
when I went out to buy food a while ago.

194
00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:52.942
I wanted to give it to her, but she's not answering the door.

195
00:12:53.942 --> 00:12:55.842
She looked annoyed just now.

196
00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.042
So maybe she sulked out and went to sleep?

197
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.350
Hey!

198
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.450
Rinko!

199
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.950
-Rinko! -Rinko!

200
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.550
Hey!

201
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.050
Rinko!

202
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.650
What's the matter, Rinko?

203
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.050
Rinko!

204
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.350
Rinko!

205
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.750
I got the CD you asked for.

206
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.450
Open the door. Hey!

207
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.750
Something's wrong.

208
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.850
We're making this much noise.

209
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.550
Knowing Rinko, she would be coming out like a while ago.

210
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.850
How can I write songs like this?

211
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.450
Well, I guess...

212
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.850
Something's wrong after all.

213
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.650
No good. I can't see well.

214
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.150
You try it, will you, kid?

215
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.350
Okay.

216
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.250
Do you have a small mirror?

217
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.250
What? Yes.

218
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.250
What's this?

219
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.950
What's up, Toru?

220
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.150
What's wrong?

221
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.250
I can see her feet.

222
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.350
They're suspended.

223
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.750
Hey, does that mean...

224
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.050
-One, two, three. -One, two, three.

225
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.850
Rinko!

226
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.050
It can't be! Why, Rinko?

227
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.950
First, lie her down.

228
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.150
Ask for an ambulance and police.

229
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.850
The room seems to be locked completely.

230
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.550
And that key

231
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.750
must've come from the key holder on her hip.

232
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.050
Those...

233
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.950
Those are the keys for her car, bicycle and car.

234
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:24.450
The black cover is probably an electronic key for the house.

235
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.750
Then the key to this room...

236
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.750
Where is it?

237
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.850
Here it is!

238
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.450
But the door and the window are all locked.

239
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.350
This room seems to be completely closed off.

240
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.350
Is this really a suicide?

241
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.550
No good.

242
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.150
She is not breathing.

243
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.550
That means the one staring at us

244
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.450
from the sealed window earlier

245
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.250
must be the devil!

246
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.750
What?

247
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.350
Don't tell me you really saw it?

248
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.450
Yes.

249
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.750
Not us. Eisuke's the one who saw it.

250
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.950
I'm sure.

251
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.750
It was a few minutes ago in the backyard.

252
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.350
You!

253
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.150
Are you sure you were not half asleep?

254
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.750
I am telling the truth!

255
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.250
It was dark so I couldn't really see it clearly,

256
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.350
but I'm sure that something was looking out the window.

257
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.350
Are you sure your glasses weren't dirty?

258
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.850
Come on.

259
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.150
But, if what he said is true,

260
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.650
maybe something is living here.

261
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.350
Because this room is the one

262
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.650
where the wife of the older brother killed herself.

263
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.450
Anyway, let's carry Rinko to the sofa.

264
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.750
It's too pitiful to let Rinko lying on the cold floor.

265
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.950
Hey, you're stepping on the keys.

266
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.050
Sorry, Rinko.

267
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.850
I see.

268
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.550
Let me sort out the circumstances.

269
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.750
You wanted to give the CD that Rinko asked you to get for her.

270
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.650
You knocked the door, but no one answered.

271
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.750
Everyone sensed that something was wrong.

272
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.250
When you looked into through the opening of the door,

273
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.250
you saw her feet suspended in the air.

274
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.650
You broke through the locked door and went inside.

275
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.850
Then you found Rinko dead in this condition, right?

276
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.450
Yes.

277
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.050
Then who has the key for this room?

278
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.550
The key holder is on her hip.

279
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.550
The key was on the keyboard.

280
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.950
This is the key for this room, isn't it?

281
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.350
Don't you have any spare keys?

282
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.550
No, that's all there is.

283
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.650
But someone could've made a spare key secretly.

284
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.250
No way.

285
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.750
When we bought this house, Rinko changed all locks to the rooms.

286
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:10.850
And...

287
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.150
She handed a key to each of us herself.

288
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.150
So after you broke the door and entered,

289
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.550
could someone have locked the window in secret?

290
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.350
No way.

291
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.550
The only one who walked around this room

292
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.750
is that boy over there.

293
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.650
All windows were locked.

294
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.750
You didn't mess with the windows, right?

295
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.650
Thus, the door was locked and the window was closed, too.

296
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.250
The room was completely closed.

297
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.950
So this is nothing other than suicide.

298
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.950
Excuse me.

299
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.150
Its what you think I might say, but the fact is otherwise.

300
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.650
This is a locked-room murder that was cleverly set up by someone!

301
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.550
And the murderer is among you.

302
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.950
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

303
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.250
Huh?

304
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.550
Where is Mr. Mouri?

305
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.650
He's not here.

306
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.950
Why not?

307
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.750
Even though Ran, Conan and you, with the glasses are all here?

308
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.650
Why isn't he here?

309
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.250
Don't ask me.

310
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.050
Hey.

311
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.950
Why are you sure that this is a locked-room murder, officer?

312
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.350
It would be hard for other people, but for we police officers,

313
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.250
we can tell right away just by looking at this chair.

314
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.350
In the case of suicide using a rope,

315
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.850
the person usually kicks the chair down.

316
00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.350
But in this case,

317
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.450
the chair is left standing and moreover, it is right under the rope.

318
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.650
In other words, someone strangled Rinko,

319
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.350
killed her and suspended her corpse in the air. This is the evidence.

320
00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.850
Sir, the chair was placed there after we broke the door

321
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.850
and entered this room.

322
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.950
Why?

323
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.550
To bring down Rinko.

324
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.350
We thought she was still alive.

325
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.650
Besides, when we entered the room,

326
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.250
if I remember correctly, the chair was lying on the floor.

327
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.350
Is that right?

328
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.250
Then, this case is undoubtedly suicide.

329
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.050
It can't be helped, then.

330
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.950
What is this?

331
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.650
This is interesting!

332
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.850
Conan, what are you doing?

333
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.250
Stop it!

334
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.950
It has a ruler on it and looks like a tape measure!

335
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.750
Hey, stop that!

336
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.750
This key holder sure stretches pretty far, doesn't it?

337
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.650
Rinko told me it's an interesting gadget

338
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.550
that can also be used as a tape measure.

339
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.550
Something about it stretching about five meters.

340
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.750
Handy, isn't it?

341
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.350
Handy? Is that all?

342
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.050
Hey, Ran.

343
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.950
If you've got a key on the key holder that can be extended that far,

344
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.950
you can open the door of this room from far away, too.

345
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.950
You're not so smart, Conan.

346
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.650
You can't open a door that far

347
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.750
unless you can extend your arm that far, don't you think?

348
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.450
No, that's not it.

349
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.650
Wait a minute.

350
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.250
If the key to this room is on that key holder...

351
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.350
That's right.

352
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.250
This room can be closed from outside.

353
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.250
Look at the distance between the place where Rinko was and the door.

354
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.450
If it's this distance,

355
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.350
the key holder on Rinko's hip can be extended

356
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.450
and pulled through the space under the door.

357
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.450
The culprit leaves and locked the room.

358
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.950
When the culprit let go...

359
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.650
it automatically springs back

360
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.150
and returns to Rinko's key holder on her hip.

361
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.150
But the key to this room was removed from the key holder.

362
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.650
Before Rinko killed herself,

363
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.950
she might have tried to erase the possibility of a murder

364
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.450
for fear that she might get her friends into trouble.

365
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.650
Or...

366
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.350
it may be that someone killed Rinko and made it look like suicide

367
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:19.250
and then destroyed the evidence pointing to it being a murder?

368
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.650
I see.

369
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.250
Wait a minute.

370
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.950
Are you saying that there is a murderer among us?

371
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.150
Cut it out!

372
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.150
You have to be joking!

373
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.450
"Next Episode" -Maybe...

374
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.550
something may have possessed you three, too!

375
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.550
I thought so.

376
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.150
There's a slot to slide the plate in.

377
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.550
Something suddenly hits me.

378
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:33.550
Next Conan, "Sealed Western-style Window (Part 2)"

379
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.450
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.850
"The order the books are placed"

381
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.850
Next week, I will be solving the case!

382
00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.450
I wonder if everything's going to turn out okay?
