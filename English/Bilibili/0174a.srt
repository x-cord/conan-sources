1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:02,999
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:04,699
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,699
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:08,399
Happy New Year, everyone!

5
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,799
And to kick off the new millennium, a two-hour special!

6
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,299
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:14,199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:17,099
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:52,199
It's the bottom of the ninth, the score's 3-2

10
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,699
with Chunichi leading by a point.

11
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,299
Ace relief pitcher, Komatsu,

12
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,299
is on the mound with two outs and runner, on second base...

13
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,499
Hey! Did you kill him?

14
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,699
Yes!

15
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,699
I shot him four times.

16
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,699
I'm sure he's dead.

17
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:21,299
So Saizo Kano, the Mastermind in the shadows,

18
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,699
is now drifting like seaweed in the sea.

19
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:27,299
Probably, the current in this area is strong.

20
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,699
Before the body floats up, it'll be food for the fishes.

21
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,399
But...

22
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,599
but why'd we have to kill him?

23
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,299
You fool! Do you think we could let that coward go?

24
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,999
He said we should turn ourselves in because we killed one lousy bank clerk.

25
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:45,199
Besides, the police had him identified.

26
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,399
Never mind him, now what're we going to do?

27
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,199
That money is hot.

28
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,699
Yes, he is right.

29
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,799
Out of the 400 million yen,

30
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,399
the cops have the serial numbers for 300 million, right?

31
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,199
Don't worry.

32
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,899
We already pulled off the big job.

33
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:02,699
All we have to do now is wait until the right time.

34
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,599
Here!

35
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,599
This is our farewell gift to you.

36
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:15,199
No grudges, okay?

37
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,399
Boss.

38
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,999
"Murder on The S.S. Symphony, 20 Years Vendetta"

39
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,399
Record...

40
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:36,299
-What? -The answer has got to be a record!

41
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,499
What are you talking about anyway?

42
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:40,799
This, here!

43
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,899
See!

44
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,899
Read this.

45
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:48,399
"Special Announcement" -Special announcement.

46
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,699
What?

47
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,699
Something important most people in Japan had during the Showa era.

48
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,899
Do you still have it?

49
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:02,099
Bring this valuable but increasingly obsolete item

50
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,099
-to join... -The next part...

51
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,399
Read the next part!

52
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,399
Don't bother me.

53
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,399
The first ten people who bring the correct item

54
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,799
will win an all-expense paid trip to the Ogasawara Dolphin Tour.

55
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,699
Let's give a try, come on.

56
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,999
There's still time, let's take a record down there!

57
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:21,399
Come on! Conan, you want to see the dolphins too, don't you?

58
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,199
Don't you, Conan?

59
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,499
Come on, you don't mind, do you?

60
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,999
We don't have anything to do this long weekend anyway.

61
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:34,199
Gosh. Forget it, the tour sounds boring.

62
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,199
Besides, your answer's wrong!

63
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,399
If it was records, they wouldn't have written "people in Japan".

64
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,299
All right. What's the right answer?

65
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:47,099
You stupid! That's what modern Japanese people have lost!

66
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,299
"Samurai spirit", no doubt about it!

67
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:52,299
How are you going to take bring something like that down there?

68
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:57,199
Besides, I've never had samurai spirit, and I doubt I ever will!

69
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,399
All right. Maybe it's a yoyo or bell bottom pants.

70
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,699
-How about that mushroom tea? -Designer brands or family computers?

71
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,999
Yes, I know what it is.

72
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,099
How about that frilled lizard?

73
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,099
It was pretty popular back then!

74
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,099
What is it anyway?

75
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,999
Excuse me.

76
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:16,299
I think the answer is...

77
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,599
You're right!

78
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,299
Right this way to the cruiser.

79
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,699
All right!

80
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,999
We did it! You were right, Conan.

81
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:30,299
I was just lucky!

82
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:31,899
Next contestant, step this way!

83
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,899
We sure were lucky we still one of the old bills!

84
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,299
Put that away right now, the others in the back will see it.

85
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,399
You're so stingy, Pops.

86
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,399
Don't worry. It's not something they pull out of their pockets so readily.

87
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,999
No way! It's not this? Unbelievable!

88
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,999
It's not the answer.

89
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,399
He was right.

90
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,699
Next contestant.

91
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,399
Wait!

92
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:00,799
This is real fancy!

93
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,299
I'm so excited!

94
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:07,999
Congratulations! This is a pamphlet for today's tour.

95
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,499
Thank you.

96
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:12,799
What number are we?

97
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:16,099
There's three in your party, but not counting the boy,

98
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,399
there's one more opening on the tour.

99
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,399
We just made it!

100
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,699
How lucky!

101
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,099
That's right. The maximum number for the tour was ten.

102
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,699
But this sure is a huge ship for such a small group.

103
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,899
Conan, we're going!

104
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,399
Okay, coming!

105
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,399
It's like a hotel!

106
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,699
Going to Ogasawara on this won't be bad!

107
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,699
Congratulations!

108
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,499
Thank you.

109
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,999
Party of three, are you one family?

110
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,099
Yes, sort of.

111
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,999
So I'll put you in a twin room. The room number is 101.

112
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:52,099
May I ask you a question?

113
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,399
Mr. Masaru Furukawa, the man who planned this tour,

114
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,699
is he on board this ship?

115
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,699
Excuse me?

116
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,999
I wanted to thank him for giving me the opportunity

117
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,199
to sail on this fantastic ship!

118
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,699
The thing is, none of us crew members have met him either.

119
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,999
You haven't met him?

120
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,599
No! The reservation for the cruise

121
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,499
as well as the method for selecting the passengers,

122
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,899
everything was done by phone.

123
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,599
The charter fee was also directly transferred through the bank.

124
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,399
I'm sure he'll be waiting for the ship at Ogasawara, though.

125
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,999
-I see. -By the way, sir,

126
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,399
may I please have your name?

127
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,399
Of course.

128
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,099
Actually, my name is Kogoro Mouri!

129
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:36,699
A former detective with the Metropolitan Police Department,

130
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,099
now an awe-inspiring well known private detective!

131
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,499
Isn't that right?

132
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,999
Oh... Police Superintendent Samezaki!

133
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,299
Hey, I'm not a Police Superintendent anymore!

134
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,699
"Toji Samezaki (62)" -I retired two years ago,

135
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,299
"Former Superintendent, Homicide Department" -I'm just an old fogey now.

136
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:56,999
It's been ages!

137
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:01,199
Is that you, Ran? You sure have grown up to be quite a beauty!

138
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,399
But what brings you here?

139
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,299
I just got a hankering to see the ocean.

140
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:10,999
Remember? Today's a special day!

141
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:14,199
A special day?

142
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,299
I don't blame you for forgetting,

143
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:20,699
after all you left the force 10 years ago.

144
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,499
By the way, how's that gorgeous wife of yours?

145
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:27,399
Don't tell me you two are still separated.

146
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,699
As a matter of fact, we are.

147
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,899
Never mind that, don't mention that woman.

148
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,399
Dad!

149
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,899
Well, excuse me.

150
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,999
What is it?

151
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,899
"Teruyoshi Kameda (45), Passenger" -Nothing, never mind.

152
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,399
A seal?

153
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,499
You dropped this.

154
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,699
Excuse me?

155
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,399
Thank you very much!

156
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,399
What? Thank you.

157
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,399
You picked up his seal, so why'd you thank him?

158
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,799
Never mind...

159
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,099
Hey!

160
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,699
What is it?

161
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,399
Are you talking to me?

162
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,599
"Korehisa Kanie (46), Passenger" -I've been waiting for you.

163
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,199
How about it?

164
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,799
Let's go have a drink over there.

165
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,299
Sir! Allow me to carry those!

166
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,399
No, thanks!

167
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,299
Party of one, sir?

168
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,299
Yes.

169
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:34,299
Excluding that boy, this man's number 10,

170
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,299
he's the last one.

171
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,099
All right, we can set out then, can't we?

172
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,299
We're already behind schedule.

173
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,299
Not yet! There's that old man who came at the beginning.

174
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:46,099
He left to go get something he forgot,

175
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,699
but hasn't come back yet.

176
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:50,899
What? That old man...

177
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,699
he was just here and said he wanted to take a short nap before dinner

178
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,699
so he didn't want to be disturbed.

179
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,199
What? When'd he gets back anyway?

180
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,299
Well, at any rate, we have the ten passengers.

181
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:05,799
I'm sorry, please send the rest of the contestants home.

182
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,799
All right! I'll go!

183
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,999
Now then, sir, you'll be in room 107.

184
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,399
Thanks!

185
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,399
Wait a minute!

186
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,999
Excuse me, but haven't we met somewhere before?

187
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:19,999
No.

188
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,299
"Minoru Ebina (42), Passenger" -You must be mistaken.

189
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:25,699
I've never seen you before today.

190
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:33,999
Did you find someone on the police wanted list, Superintendent Samezaki?

191
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:38,299
Thanks to you people, I'm certain we'll have a safe journey, Mr. Mouri.

192
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,899
What?

193
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,699
After all, he is a former police officer

194
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:42,699
and you are a private investigator.

195
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,699
There're three of you on board!

196
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,499
Three of us?

197
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:50,199
There's someone else besides us?

198
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,099
Yes! Another private investigator,

199
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,099
although he doesn't look it.

200
00:10:56,099 --> 00:11:00,499
Thank you all for joining us today on the S.S. Symphony,

201
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:02,499
we will now leave the dock.

202
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,999
We are scheduled to arrive in Ogasawara tomorrow morning,

203
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,399
relax and have a pleasant journey!

204
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:41,599
I'm the king of the world!

205
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,099
She said she wanted to that once in her lifetime.

206
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,099
She's been watching too many movies.

207
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,899
What is she going to do if we really sink? What a bad omen!

208
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,699
Well...

209
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:56,599
"Sadao Kujirai (50), Passenger" -The mighty ocean glowing in the sunset.

210
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,399
With the fantastic view right in front of us,

211
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,399
I don't blame her for wanting to shout like that.

212
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,199
That felt good!

213
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,199
The sea certainly is wonderful.

214
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,199
It is! It makes you forget all the unpleasant things!

215
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,599
You're right.

216
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,599
The sea does do that.

217
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,299
It hides everything.

218
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,099
"Nagisa Isogai (27), Passenger" -Painful memories,

219
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:21,599
the uncertain future,

220
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:24,599
and even corpses.

221
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,499
What?

222
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,999
Did you say corpses?

223
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,699
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said such a horrible thing.

224
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,999
My father drowned awhile back. I can't help thinking of it.

225
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,599
I'm sorry to hear that.

226
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:43,999
We've all got to be grateful to Mr. Furukawa got sponsoring this tour.

227
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:46,899
I know who he is!

228
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,299
Remember that seal I picked up?

229
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,299
That's when I saw it.

230
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,299
The name Furukawa was on it.

231
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,999
Conan, you saw it too, didn't you?

232
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,299
Yes.

233
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,299
So that's why you thanked him back then.

234
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:00,699
That's right!

235
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:02,699
You see!

236
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,199
That man with the seal is Mr. Furukawa!

237
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,999
I'm sure he intends to reveal his identity during dinner

238
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,299
and surprise everyone.

239
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,199
That's strange.

240
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,199
I asked him his name

241
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:18,699
and I'm positive he said it was Kameda.

242
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,199
You're kidding!

243
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,699
Hey, Mouri! They're announcing dinner!

244
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,499
All right, thank you!

245
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,399
So you're the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

246
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,699
That's right.

247
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,399
What an honour.

248
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,499
I'm going back to my room and rest for a bit.

249
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,199
You still get seasick, I see.

250
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
May I pour you more wine?

251
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,699
Yes, thank you!

252
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:52,899
This ship is so huge and there are so few passengers on board,

253
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,099
it seems like such a waste.

254
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,799
I agree with you!

255
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,799
Counting the two passengers resting in their rooms,

256
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,499
there's only eleven of you on board.

257
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,299
That's if you include me!

258
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,799
The two passengers you're talking about

259
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,699
is that the other private investigator and the old man?

260
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:12,599
-Yes! -I passed that old man in the corridor.

261
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,999
He seems to be the quiet type. What does he do?

262
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,699
Well, it seems he's a marine researcher

263
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:25,599
and his name is Saizo Kano.

264
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,299
Kano Saizo?

265
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,804
Where is his room?

266
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:38,604
His room number is 101.

267
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:42,004
Saizo Kano? I've heard that name somewhere before.

268
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,604
You idiot! How could you forget?

269
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:47,704
Many years ago, you and I both were after him,

270
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:50,704
he was the mastermind behind the 400 million yen heist.

271
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:54,404
"Saizo Kano" -He is Saizo Kano, the Mastermind in the shadows!

272
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:16,604
You have the master key, don't you?

273
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:17,604
Yes!

274
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:25,704
Listen, if it's him, he may have a gun.

275
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,604
As soon as you open the door, get out of the way!

276
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,004
Yes, sir!

277
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,704
Don't worry! Please calm down.

278
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,404
I've unlocked it.

279
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:42,904
Let's go!

280
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,604
What is this?

281
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:55,404
Strange, it looks like no one's been inside.

282
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:58,904
Are you sure this is the room?

283
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:01,204
Yes! There's no mistake!

284
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:02,704
Darn it!

285
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,204
I'll look on the lower deck!

286
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:07,104
Mouri, you check the upper!

287
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:08,304
Yes, sir!

288
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:10,604
"Engine Room"

289
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:16,004
Hey!

290
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,704
Where are you?

291
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:19,704
I know you're in here!

292
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,004
I read the letter!

293
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:26,704
Hey!

294
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:36,704
If he's not in the room, then he could be on the deck.

295
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,904
Who is in the room next door, 102?

296
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:41,304
It's the other private investigator's room.

297
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:46,004
He hasn't been out of his room since he boarded the ship.

298
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,704
That sounds pretty suspicious.

299
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:52,404
Excuse me, sir, may I come in?

300
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:53,404
Sir.

301
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,704
Here, let me do it.

302
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,704
Hey, you! I know you're in there!

303
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,804
Answer me! Hey!

304
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,304
Guess we have no other choice.

305
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,004
Will you unlock this door too?

306
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:08,404
Be quiet!

307
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:11,004
What's the entire racket about?

308
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:15,004
What? Mr. Mouri?

309
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:17,404
What are all of you doing here?

310
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,704
That's what I'd like to ask you.

311
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,304
Mastermind in the shadows?

312
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:26,704
Now that you mention it, my dad told me about it

313
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:29,304
when I was a kid.

314
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:32,304
His real name's Saizo Kano.

315
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:39,504
He was the mastermind behind the 400 million yen heist 20 years ago.

316
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:42,104
The plan was perfectly calculated, nothing went wrong.

317
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,304
The job went off without a hitch

318
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:46,004
and they escaped the police so smoothly.

319
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:49,304
He was called "Mastermind in the shadows".

320
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,704
He was a loner. He changed partners with every job.

321
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:57,004
His trademark was he never hurt anyone during the crime.

322
00:17:57,004 --> 00:18:00,404
But then during the robbery 20 years ago,

323
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:02,704
he killed his first victim.

324
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:06,404
And since that incident, he was never heard of again.

325
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:09,704
You mean that fellow was sleeping in the room next to mine?

326
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:12,204
Yes, but when we got there, he was long gone.

327
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:15,204
Mr. Samezaki is looking for him now.

328
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:19,504
That's real strange, I'm sure he was dead.

329
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:20,904
They found his clothes washed up on some beach,

330
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:23,604
there were bullet holes in them and bloodstains too.

331
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,304
My father told me that.

332
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,004
He's not dead!

333
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:31,704
That coat was planted to fool the police.

334
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:37,504
He wasn't the kind of guy who'd die that easily, kid.

335
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:39,504
I thought that he and his partners

336
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:42,304
were out there counting their money somewhere.

337
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,904
Who would have thought...

338
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,504
he'd be on the same ship?

339
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:50,004
But the statute of limitations on that case ran out 5 years ago.

340
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,704
Even if you caught up with them, you can't do a thing.

341
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:54,204
Idiot! Did you forget?

342
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:56,704
The statute of limitation for murder is 15 years.

343
00:18:56,704 --> 00:19:00,304
But in a civil case, the statute of limitations is 20 years!

344
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:03,004
If you're ordered to return the money, you have to!

345
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:04,604
That's right. Unfortunately,

346
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,904
the statute of limitations has run out for Kano's arrest,

347
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:11,104
but his three partners can still be arrested.

348
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:15,304
If we can find Kano and make him tell us where the others are,

349
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:18,704
we can get the money back somehow.

350
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:23,304
There's a possibility his partners are on this ship too, isn't there?

351
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:25,804
Then when we get to Ogasawara,

352
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:28,504
let's notify the police and get them to help us search the ship.

353
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,504
After all, we're out at sea,

354
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,004
they can't get away so easily.

355
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:36,304
You fool! There's no time!

356
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:40,004
Like I said, today's a special day.

357
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,904
Tomorrow is the 20th anniversary of that robbery!

358
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,704
At exactly midnight tonight,

359
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,904
the statute of limitations will run out and they'll be free men.

360
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,904
Nobody can touch them after that!

361
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:53,104
You mean, in just two hours...

362
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:55,904
The statute limitations on the crime will run out completely?

363
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,004
What? Is that you, Hattori?

364
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:01,404
Hi, Ran, long time no see.

365
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,004
What's going on?

366
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:05,304
I didn't know you were on this ship too.

367
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,304
Yes, I was sleeping peacefully in my cabin

368
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:09,704
when this old guy came banging on my door.

369
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:12,104
Is Kazuha with you too?

370
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:16,104
Why bring her name up? She's not my girlfriend or anything!

371
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:19,104
We're not as close as you two!

372
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:21,004
What? Who are you talking about?

373
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:25,804
Well, I mean you and your dad, you're so close.

374
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:28,204
Don't get personal!

375
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:30,504
Did you find him, Mr. Samezaki?

376
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,704
That shadow man you were talking about.

377
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:36,304
No, your father and I were just leaving to continue the search!

378
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:39,004
All right. We'll be in the restaurant downstairs!

379
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,204
Hey, wait a minute! We've got to help them.

380
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:47,004
What did you say? Are you telling me to wait all by myself

381
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,904
when there's a dangerous man lurking somewhere on board?

382
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:51,004
Well... no.

383
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:53,004
All right, Dad. I'll just wait for you.

384
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,104
Okay!

385
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,604
I'll be waiting!

386
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,704
I'll be waiting, Dad!

387
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,204
Darn it!

388
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,704
Is something wrong, sir?

389
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:10,704
No, it's nothing!

390
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:14,704
All right, let's start from the top deck and work our way down.

391
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:15,904
Sure.

392
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:23,805
I would never have thought

393
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:26,705
that you were interested in dolphins!

394
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,305
Dolphins?

395
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:34,005
Didn't you come here after reading the advertisement in the newspaper?

396
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:38,405
No, I'm here because I got a strange letter!

397
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:39,905
A strange letter?

398
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:41,905
Yes, about a week ago,

399
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:47,905
I received a letter telling me to come to Ogasawara for a case.

400
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:51,305
They enclosed 100,000 yen as an advance.

401
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:52,505
100,000 yen?

402
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:55,505
That's right, but it was pretty weird,

403
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:57,705
all the bills were the old design

404
00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:59,805
and there was no return address.

405
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,505
What about a name?

406
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:03,605
Masaru Furukawa was written.

407
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,805
-Furukawa? -Furukawa?

408
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,905
You know who he is?

409
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,505
What are you talking about?

410
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:12,105
Furukawa is the name of the man who planned this whole tour!

411
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:13,805
Is that so?

412
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:15,505
I had no idea.

413
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:16,905
The letter told me I'd be able to get aboard

414
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,505
if I showed the bill at the gate. That's all.

415
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:23,205
So you were invited on board to work as a private investigator.

416
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:26,405
I've never taken a job where I got paid first,

417
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:28,105
so I intended to return the money personally.

418
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,905
That's why I got on board.

419
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:32,305
Besides, I was pretty interested in what kind of case it was.

420
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:34,205
But what a coincidence!

421
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:36,705
Here we are, all on the same ship!

422
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:39,505
Actually, I called you when I got to Haneda Airport.

423
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:40,505
I thought I'd ask Kudo...

424
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:44,105
I mean, Mr. Mouri to come with me.

425
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:46,805
But no one answered the phone.

426
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:49,505
We must have just left.

427
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,505
But here we are anyway.

428
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,805
That's why they say monkeys will attract monkeys

429
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,905
and private investigators will attract their lot too!

430
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:59,605
Right, kid?

431
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:02,605
So you're the other private investigator?

432
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:04,405
You're awfully young.

433
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:05,405
Well, yes!

434
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:08,605
So, have you found that so called Saizo Kano fellow?

435
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:11,405
No, I think they're still looking for him.

436
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:14,005
Hey!

437
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,305
You want to use this?

438
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,605
Thanks, I appreciate it.

439
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:22,305
No problem.

440
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,405
Hey, why don't we all play some poker?

441
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,105
We can go to the lounge over there.

442
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:30,405
Good idea, but what about cards?

443
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:33,805
Don't worry, I brought a deck with me.

444
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:36,305
How about you fellows?

445
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:38,605
You look like you need some entertainment.

446
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:43,305
-Find him? -No, he isn't anywhere.

447
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:46,705
Where'd this jerk disappears to?

448
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:51,305
Darn, we have less than an hour.

449
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,105
-Mouri. -Yes!

450
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:56,105
I'm not giving up.

451
00:23:56,105 --> 00:24:00,105
Not on this case, not until the very last second.

452
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,105
I swear!

453
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:07,405
Superintendent Samezaki! Let's search one more time!

454
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,005
Yes, you're right.

455
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:11,805
Let's go over the ship one more time, Mouri!

456
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:12,805
Yes, sir!

457
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,005
Full house!

458
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,005
Gosh, you won again.

459
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,105
All right...

460
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,605
After the next game, whoever has the lowest score

461
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,605
will change places with Mr. Kujirai.

462
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:29,605
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?

463
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:32,505
Yes, it's 11:55 pm.

464
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:36,205
You've been asking the time so many times,

465
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,705
are you expecting something?

466
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:41,805
It's just that tomorrow is a very special day.

467
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:44,705
There, two pairs aces and nines.

468
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,505
Wait...

469
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:48,505
I'm the loser.

470
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:50,605
All right, Mr. Kujira's turn.

471
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:54,505
All right, miss, be gentle with me.

472
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:03,405
Hey, when you said tomorrow's a special day,

473
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:05,405
did you mean the anniversary of your girlfriend's death?

474
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,405
What?

475
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,705
Your cocktail.

476
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:11,405
It's a Bloody Mary, isn't it?

477
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:15,805
Don't tell me it's the day a Princess you adored passed away.

478
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,805
No, nothing like that!

479
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,605
Dad! Did you find him?

480
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:28,005
He's nowhere to be found.

481
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:31,005
Where's the former Superintendent of Police?

482
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:34,005
He says he'll search until times up.

483
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,105
Would you like something to drink?

484
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,705
Water.

485
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,005
Yes, sir.

486
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:42,705
I guess I'll be calling it quits soon.

487
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,105
That's it for me too.

488
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:45,405
Yes, me too.

489
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:48,005
All right, after we're done,

490
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,805
I'll fix the cards and bring them to your room later.

491
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:53,405
I'd appreciate that.

492
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:55,105
How much is my bar tab?

493
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:57,805
-Let's see. You had two martinis. -I'll pay my bill too.

494
00:25:57,805 --> 00:26:00,605
What? My wallet's...

495
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:02,905
Could this be yours?

496
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,405
Yes, it is. That's mine.

497
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:07,805
It was on the floor in the corridor, so I picked it up!

498
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:11,205
Come on! I haven't taken anything!

499
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:14,805
Sorry, but I just want to be sure.

500
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:20,105
Are you quitting too, Mr. Kujirai?

501
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:22,005
No, I'm just going to the toilet.

502
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:25,405
Let's take a break, I'll be back soon.

503
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:53,705
Time's run out.

504
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,805
We can't touch that case now.

505
00:26:56,805 --> 00:27:00,405
But since I retired two years ago,

506
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:04,105
I have no authority anyway.

507
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,405
Sir.

508
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:08,705
Can I still get a drink?

509
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,405
Sure, no problem.

510
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,905
Give me a beer.

511
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:14,105
Yes, sir!

512
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:24,305
You did your best, sir.

513
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:26,105
Mouri!

514
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,305
Come on!

515
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:28,505
Mouri, let's drink up!

516
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:31,205
All right! I'm with you all the way!

517
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:32,805
The drinks are on me!

518
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:36,805
-Gosh, that's generous of you. -I realise it was his case

519
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,805
but isn't he taking it a little too personal?

520
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:45,205
But just like always...

521
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,105
What was that?

522
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:49,705
It came from outside. The upper deck!

523
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:50,905
A gunshot?

524
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,005
Mouri! What time is it?

525
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,305
12:08 am!

526
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:06,005
The flag!

527
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:08,105
The flag's burning!

528
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,705
Hey, what was that?

529
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:12,805
It sounded like fireworks.

530
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:14,205
Hey, Kudo.

531
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:15,905
Do you think this just some prank?

532
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:18,505
No. Look at that, Hattori.

533
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:20,405
What?

534
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:22,105
What is this?

535
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:25,305
Something's written on it!

536
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:27,305
Don't touch the knife!

537
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,705
Who are you talking to? I'm no amateur!

538
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:33,205
Excuse me, go and get me a plastic bag.

539
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:34,305
Yes, sir!

540
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,105
Do you always carry those things around?

541
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:40,505
Old habits are hard to break!

542
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,605
What's written on it?

543
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:48,005
"Poseidon, the God of the Sea gave me life,"

544
00:28:48,005 --> 00:28:50,005
"thus my shadow is resurrected."

545
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:56,305
-Mr. Kujirai? -He... he's alive.

546
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:58,305
I knew it. That guy is...

547
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:02,005
That guy is...

548
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,305
alive!

549
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:07,005
-What is that? -What is that?

550
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:08,405
What's happened?

551
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,405
Captain! Explosion on the stern!

552
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:12,405
Stop all engines! Extinguish the flames!

553
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:14,105
Stop all engines!

554
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:16,905
What happened?

555
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,305
There was an explosion at the stern this time!

556
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:21,305
-What? -What's on fire?

557
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:26,705
This is the box the emergency escape ladder is kept it.

558
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:28,705
But why would anyone do this?

559
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,605
A body!

560
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,305
Somebody's being burned!
