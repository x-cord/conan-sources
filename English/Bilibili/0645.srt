1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,240
Due to Ran's absence,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,640
Pops and I end up eating out for dinner.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,840
After seeing some flyers,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,240
we decided to head to Haido City for ramen.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,440
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For" "Ramen Ogura"

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,340
Flaunting a "So Good it's to Die For" slogan,

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,140
will this shabby-looking shop really be all right?

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,540
And yet, Mr. Saizu, a customer who arrived after us

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,340
was a real estate agent who plotted to land-shark this shopping street.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,640
Alienated owner Ogura, assistant Sayo,

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,140
and the adjacent barbershop manager Taninaka,

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,640
he had soured the atmosphere.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,740
Despite its shabby appearance and a hostile atmosphere,

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,340
the shop's ramen was one-of-a-kind.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,540
The slogan "So Good it's to Die For" was true to its words.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,740
However, after eating some of the ramen,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,340
Mr. Saizu suddenly let out on anguished cry.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,140
And actually, died.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,740
The cause of death was hydrocyanic poisoning.

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,040
Was this murder?

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,440
If so, the culprit would have to be someone in this shop.

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,740
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,140
Inspiration hits upon entering the shop.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
The Death Lord ramen shall speak of the truth.

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,840
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:53,235
"Ramen So Good it's to Die For (Part 2)"

30
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,435
Inspector.

31
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,935
How'd it go? The investigation?

32
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:07,035
No poison was detected inside the ramen in question.

33
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:11,135
Of course none was found in the water the victim drank

34
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:14,235
or on the decorative flowers at the victim's seat,

35
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,735
or the glass they were arranged in.

36
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:20,735
Which means Sayo and I are cleared from suspicion, right?

37
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,335
However...

38
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,635
On the thumb and index finger of the victim's left hand.

39
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,235
And on the chopsticks the victim used,

40
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:29,935
as well as atop the table at his seat,

41
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,835
toxicity tests came back positive.

42
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:36,235
Well, the poison detected on the chopsticks

43
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,635
and on the table were just a slight amount, though...

44
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,935
Also we found the same toxic powder

45
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,735
from the inside pocket of the victim's jacket.

46
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:45,835
Would you have any clues?

47
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:49,835
Such as, if you had seen Mr. Saizu put his hand in his inside pocket.

48
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:53,035
Well, can't say that I have.

49
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,535
But if so, wouldn't that man have applied the poison

50
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,135
on his finger himself and licked it?

51
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,335
That reminds me, Mr. Saizu,

52
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,835
remarked before he collapsed...

53
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,135
"My company is going down in flames,

54
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:06,735
that it makes me feel like dying."

55
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:07,835
Now that you mention it,

56
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,435
that punk also went on about how he should poison our ramen

57
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:12,035
and destroy our shop.

58
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,735
That's it.

59
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,635
Bet he was trying to put poison in ramen

60
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:17,935
but ended up accidentally ingesting it.

61
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,335
It seems that the possibility of this being a suicide

62
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:23,635
-or an accident still exists. -That's true.

63
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,335
Apologies, but Detective Mouri.

64
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,335
Yes.

65
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:30,235
Could you come inside and explain everything once again?

66
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:31,435
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:34,535
-Then I'll go too. -No, you can't.

68
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,735
Kids shouldn't get in the way of the work of adults.

69
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,935
But...

70
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:43,735
He's right, just let the detectives do their investigation.

71
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:46,035
It's not something for a kid to see.

72
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,535
Then, if you all would stand by outside for a few more mimutes.

73
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,335
Wait.

74
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:55,335
So there wasn't any poison on Mr. Saizu's other belongings,

75
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,835
besides on his inside jacket pocket?

76
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:58,135
Right.

77
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:00,135
We examined his handkerchief, wallet,

78
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:02,035
cigarettes, and lighter,

79
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,135
even the glass that fell to the ground, but got nothing.

80
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:08,535
Then, was there anyone among the three

81
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:11,035
who had anything suspicious on them from the body search?

82
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,935
Like a container that could've held the poison.

83
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,735
No, here wasn't.

84
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,735
All Manager Ogure had on him

85
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,935
were cigarettes, a lighter, and a potable ashtray.

86
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,635
The part-timer, Ohashi had a cell phone,

87
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:28,535
a handkerchief, eye drops, and a purse.

88
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,635
Mr. Taninaka from the barbershop

89
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,935
only had his wallet, glasses, and the keys to his shop.

90
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,135
And the contents of the eye drops?

91
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,235
We did examine that,

92
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,335
but they were just ordinary eye drops.

93
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,935
Incidentally, manager Ogura's cigarettes

94
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:45,435
were just enough for a quick puff after closing.

95
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,835
And Mr. Taninaka's glasses are apparently reading glasses

96
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,735
that he seldom wears.

97
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:52,735
And by the way, when Mr. Saizu collapsed,

98
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,235
Mr. Ogura said,

99
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:57,835
"Idiot, think we've gonna fall for that same trick again?"

100
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:00,235
But have there been other cases like this?

101
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,535
Yes, seems it has happened twice.

102
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:06,735
The first time,

103
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:11,035
Ms. Ohashi called an ambulance and it caused a big commotion.

104
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:13,735
But it was deemed a malingering by the hospital.

105
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:18,635
The second time, Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka who happened to be there

106
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,735
threw a collapsed customer out of the shop.

107
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,335
And that customer picked himself up,

108
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:24,435
cursed them and left.

109
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,135
Well, I was told that these two customers

110
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,835
were both hired by Mr. Saizu to cause trouble.

111
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:37,135
Then, I'll go back inside and continue with the investigation.

112
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,835
Hold on, wait.

113
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:41,135
I still have questions to ask you...

114
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,935
Hey, not again.

115
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,235
I told you to wait outside.

116
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:51,135
Boy, you've watched too many mystery dramas.

117
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,935
Think you're like the young Kobayashi of the Boy Detective's Squad?

118
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:59,235
No, rather than young Kobayashi,

119
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,335
I feel like t Kogoro Akechi,

120
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:03,735
who has seen right through the truth.

121
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,935
Well, according to our investigation,

122
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:14,535
there was no poison inside of the ramen the deceased Saizu ate.

123
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,435
Neither did the water nor the glass that was brought to him

124
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:22,435
before he ordered ramen.

125
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:24,335
Nor the decorative flowers on the seat where Mr. Saizu sat,

126
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:26,835
nor the glass they were arranged in.

127
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:28,635
Poison was detected, however,

128
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:33,235
on the left-handed Saizu's left thumb and left index finger.

129
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:37,035
Although there was also poison detected on the chopsticks he used

130
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,435
and on the tabletop where he sat,

131
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:40,735
we can exclude those due to the minute amount found.

132
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,535
Also out of Mr. Saizu's belongings,

133
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,935
no poison was on his handkerchief, wallet,

134
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:48,735
glasses, cigarettes, or lighter.

135
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,535
But we found powdered poison in his inside jacket pocket.

136
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:56,035
Further, the fact that before Mr. Saizu died,

137
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,935
he said things like, "I feel like dying"

138
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,635
and "I'll destroy this shop by poisoning the ramen",

139
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:03,235
if we take those into account,

140
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,235
Mr. Saizu would've most likely

141
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,835
touched the poison he put in his inside jacket pocket,

142
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,235
and either committed suicide

143
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:13,635
or was plotting to lace the ramen with poison.

144
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:16,635
Thus, this case is not a homicide.

145
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,635
Inspector.

146
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,835
Other than on Saizu's fingers,

147
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,635
wasn't there poison on the chopsticks and table?

148
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,435
In that case, wouldn't it be too early

149
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:29,335
to determine that it wasn't a homicide?

150
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:31,935
Saizu was sitting at the seat of the regular customer

151
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:33,735
who died a short while ago.

152
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:35,735
And it seems that Saizu often purposely sat at that seat

153
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:39,035
as a form of harassment, so...

154
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,735
Even if his seat could've been predicted in advance,

155
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:44,635
the conclusion is the same.

156
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,135
I already said this,

157
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,235
but the amount of poison detected on the chopsticks

158
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:49,935
and table was insignificant.

159
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:51,235
We've no choice but to think he touched those

160
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:53,635
with his poison-laced hand.

161
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:55,535
Not to mention, the other chopsticks

162
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,335
in the chopstick stand had no poison on them, right?

163
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:01,235
It would've been impossible to pinpoint

164
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:02,935
a place on the chopsticks or table for the victim to touch.

165
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:05,235
Good point.

166
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,435
Ramen...

167
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,935
pardon me...

168
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:16,735
Detective Mouri?

169
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:21,035
He's gotten into his usual trance-like state.

170
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,835
It's just me putting him to sleep with my tranquilizer gun.

171
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,035
Hey, is he all right?

172
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,735
His dizziness looked pretty awful, didn't it?

173
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,535
Almost as if he was a puppet who had his strings cut.

174
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:35,535
Right, a puppet indeed.

175
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,135
I didn't mean me,

176
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:40,135
but Mr. Saizu did have someone pulling his strings.

177
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:42,235
From the time he entered this shop,

178
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:44,835
it was as if he'd been possessed by a devil

179
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,735
to apply poison to his own fingers,

180
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:49,335
and then bring it to his mouth.

181
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:53,435
Just as the culprit among us expected.

182
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,235
Are you telling me that one of these three

183
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:59,735
is a hypnotist or something of the sort?

184
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:03,935
No, to say that he had been possessed by a devil was just a metaphor.

185
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:07,035
The truth is the culprit took advantage

186
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,735
of the fact that people under a certain condition

187
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:12,635
would invariably do something specific upon entering a ramen shop.

188
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:16,435
Invariably do something specific?

189
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,035
Don't tell me you mean every customer that enters a ramen shop

190
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,735
will put their hand into their inside jacket pocket.

191
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,435
The poison in his inside pocket

192
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,835
was a fake planted by the culprit,

193
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,335
in order to make it look like a suicide.

194
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,635
The culprit probably prepared

195
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:33,335
something very similar to one of Saizu's belongings.

196
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:34,735
Applied poison on it,

197
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:38,535
and switched the two during the confusion after the incident.

198
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,535
By "switched" you mean...

199
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:44,335
I bet the culprit still has it on him.

200
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,935
Mr. Saizu's belongings with the poison on them.

201
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:52,535
Then, we'll check them again.

202
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,035
There's a way to figure it out soon

203
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:55,635
even without doing that.

204
00:10:56,935 --> 00:11:02,435
Just have them use these items the same way Mr. Saizu did.

205
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:03,835
I see.

206
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,935
If forced to use an item of Mr. Saizu's,

207
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,835
which the culprit wasn't used to using,

208
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,335
they'd likely give themselves away, yes?

209
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:14,435
Right. If I recall, all three people have something

210
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:17,435
that duplicated what Mr. Saizu had.

211
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,535
Mr. Ogura had cigarettes and a lighter.

212
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:23,635
Sayo had a handkerchief...

213
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,335
Mr. Taninaka had a wallet and glasses.

214
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,040
Then...

215
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
Let's have Mr. Ogura light one of his cigarettes,

216
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,740
Sayo fold your handkerchief

217
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,140
and Mr. Taninaka, for the time being, put on your glasses.

218
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,940
Of course, in the same manner as the left-handed Mr. Saizu.

219
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,340
With your left hands.

220
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
All right, everyone, if you would please.

221
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,240
But, see here...

222
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,940
You said the culprit would be revealed this away, but...

223
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,640
Since we're originally right-handed...

224
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,040
There's no way we could do it well with our left hands.

225
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,540
What's the matter, sir?

226
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,440
Your glasses are crooked?

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,740
Like I said,

228
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,540
I can't really put them on correctly with my left hand.

229
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,540
It's because you're not firmly holding the connective point

230
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,640
where the frame and temple meet, like this.

231
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,940
So can you try putting them on again?

232
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I've got no choice.

233
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,840
There you go again.

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,840
You're grabbing onto the end of the temple.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,640
Why aren't you holding over here?

236
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,040
It's just...

237
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,740
Or...

238
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,240
You just won't hold it there?

239
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,840
Since that's where the poison is?

240
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,540
Officer Takagi, check those glasses.

241
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,040
Yes, sir.

242
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,040
If you would please...

243
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,940
But, isn't this strange?

244
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,340
Since Taninaka came into this shop,

245
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,340
he never even came close to Saizu.

246
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,940
That's right.

247
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,340
In between Mr. Taninaka and that man was the little boy's group,

248
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,640
there's no way he could've ever touched,

249
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,340
or even come close to that man, is there?

250
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,540
So, how on earth could he have laced poison onto his glasses?

251
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,640
She's right.

252
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,540
True, it would've been difficult for him to do so here.

253
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,940
But if Mr. Taninaka did it in his barbershop,

254
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,140
it would've been an easy task.

255
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,040
Come to think of it, he did say this.

256
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,540
That Mr. Saizu had his hair cut at Taninaka's barbershop

257
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,340
just before he came here to eat ramen.

258
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,540
Yes.

259
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
At a barbershop, it's only natural for the barber

260
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,340
to hold onto your glasses and jacket

261
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,640
while your hair is being cut.

262
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,940
Mr. Taninaka would've had enough opportunities

263
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,140
to poison his glasses and plant poison in his jacket.

264
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,940
No way.

265
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,440
We'll concede for argument's sake,

266
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,540
but how the heck was he able to make Saizu touch it?

267
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Since it wasn't like he was hypnotized or anything,

268
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,740
no way he'd so conveniently touch it.

269
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,640
He definitely would touch it!

270
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,640
Hey, when in the world did you get outside?

271
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Because a person wearing glasses...

272
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,640
walk into ramen shops or warm places,

273
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,940
immediately...

274
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,740
this will happen.

275
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,140
Condensation?

276
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,440
And, if your glasses cloud up,

277
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,340
normally you'll do this.

278
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,540
I see.

279
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,240
If his glasses clouded up due to condensation,

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
he would've taken them off in order to wipe them

281
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,440
with a handkerchief or something.

282
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
That's when the poison got onto his finger.

283
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,540
However, Mr. Saizu was left-handed.

284
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,740
If he took his handkerchief and wiped his glasses using his left hand,

285
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,240
poison should've also gotten on to his handkerchief.

286
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,140
Mr. Saizu was ambidextrous.

287
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,140
He said that his parents tried to correct his left-handedness.

288
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,040
That's why he used his right hand to wipe the spilled water on the table.

289
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,540
But he wasn't comfortable unless he ate using his left hand.

290
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,340
In short, when Mr. Saizu entered this shop,

291
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,140
he took out his handkerchief with his right hand

292
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,140
and wiped his glasses.

293
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,440
Not at all expecting that poison had been applied to his glasses.

294
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
But, if he had used his left hand

295
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,840
to take out his handkerchief...

296
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,440
That's possible.

297
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,740
Since Saizu was ambidextrous,

298
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,140
there's an equal chance for him to use either hand to take it out.

299
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,040
No, the handkerchief was inside his jacket's left chest pocket.

300
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
Since he's ambidextrous he'd use his right hand

301
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
to take it out since it'd be easier.

302
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,540
As for the tabletop having traces of poison,

303
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,240
it was because he touched it with his left hand

304
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,840
while seating himself.

305
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Then, as he was ready to eat ramen

306
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,040
and took chopsticks from the chopstick stand,

307
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,540
some poison also got on there.

308
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,440
As he used his mouth to split apart the chopsticks,

309
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
poison stuck onto his lips and teeth.

310
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,740
As soon as he slurped up his ramen,

311
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,840
the poison entered his system just like that.

312
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,140
Incidentally, the reason Mr. Taninaka passed the chopsticks to us

313
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,740
is because he didn't want Mr. Saizu to do so.

314
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
If he had used his poisoned hand to pass the chopsticks to us,

315
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,740
we might have also been poisoned to death.

316
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,840
So, you're saying that he came to the shop

317
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,040
to make sure no innocent customers would get dragged into it?

318
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,140
But, wait...

319
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,440
Just when could Taninaka have switched the glasses?

320
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,340
If he hadn't switched them,

321
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,040
the trick would've been disclosed in no time.

322
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Switching the glasses was done

323
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,740
when Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka

324
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,340
were about to throw the collapsed Saizu out of the shop.

325
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,540
At the time, Mr. Saizu collapsed,

326
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
the glasses flew to the ground near his legs.

327
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,940
We squatted near Saizu's legs

328
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,740
in order to lift the lower part of the body.

329
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,440
As for Mr. Taninaka,

330
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,940
he had the opportunity to switch the glasses

331
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,340
and block our view with his body.

332
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,640
But, wasn't it only by chance that his glasses flew off?

333
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,540
If his glasses had remained firmly on his face,

334
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,540
wouldn't it have been difficult to switch them?

335
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,140
Of the two incidents of food poisoning that had occurred in this shop...

336
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,540
The second time,

337
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,840
Mr. Ogura and Mr. Taninaka threw the customer

338
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,740
who had pretended to have food poisoning out of the shop.

339
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,940
So this time, he could predict

340
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,940
that Mr. Ogura would do the same thing when Saizu collapsed.

341
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,740
He knew that Mr. Ogura would ask him to help

342
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,140
throw Saizu out into the street.

343
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,740
This time, it was by luck

344
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,140
that a detective drama-obsessed brat with glasses blurted out,

345
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,540
"Don't touch the body."

346
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,640
But had it not been for that,

347
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,340
he would have plenty of chances to switch them.

348
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,540
After they cast him out of the shop,

349
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,640
he could fetch the glasses that had fallen to the ground

350
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,240
or he could rush to the unresponsive Mr. Saizu and do it.

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,940
Inspector Megure.

352
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,740
The glasses Taninaka had on him tested positive for poison.

353
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,740
It appears that we've obtained

354
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,740
conclusive evidence against you, Mr. Taninaka.

355
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,240
Hold on.

356
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
There's some kind of mistake.

357
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,840
That's right.

358
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,240
Mr. Taninaka wouldn't kill anyone.

359
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,240
That's enough, you two.

360
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,740
I don't deserve the privilege of your defense.

361
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,840
-What? -What?

362
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,040
To kill Saizu in this shop

363
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,640
and hopefully thereby ruin this shop was my plan.

364
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,940
I thought that no one would come to a ramen shop

365
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,140
where someone had been poisoned to death.

366
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,140
But... why'd you do that?

367
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,140
Haven't we gotten by pretty well these twenty years as neighbors?

368
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,140
Gotten by pretty well?

369
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,240
In these past 20 years,

370
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,640
just what have you achieved?

371
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,340
We worked our rears and souls off in order to raise money,

372
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,240
all for the sake of making this Haido Shopping Street a stylish place.

373
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,840
But you haven't remodeled your shop even once.

374
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I told you, I don't have the money.

375
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
Horse-racing, boat-races, road races,

376
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,640
if you had only let up on those a little,

377
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,740
you could've saved up some, no?

378
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,840
That's...

379
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
If you ask my opinion,

380
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,440
your profit margin on the ramen was way too low.

381
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,140
Without raising the price, you even hired a part-time worker,

382
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,440
you just don't have any business sense.

383
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
Saizu said it, right?

384
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,740
That the people of the shopping street

385
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,140
were calling this shop the black sheep.

386
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,640
That was actually true.

387
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,040
They asked me many times

388
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,340
if I could be the one to tell you,

389
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,240
"Please either remodel the shop or leave".

390
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,640
Then, why didn't you tell us that outright?

391
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,340
If you had, our owner could have...

392
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,540
I couldn't tell you.

393
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,940
Because I loved the ramen here.

394
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,640
Without regard to profit,

395
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,140
you steadfastly kept the same taste and price.

396
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,040
Your spirit as an owner radiated.

397
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,940
All right, we'll get the rest at the station.

398
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,040
This is my heart talking now,

399
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,240
but I believed in you guys.

400
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,140
With your ramen, even if you moved elsewhere,

401
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
you'd definitely keep on prospering.

402
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,340
One month later,

403
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,940
Barbershop Taninaka and Ramen Ogura were both demolished.

404
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,540
And the ramen that was so good it was to die for

405
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,940
vanished from Haido City.

406
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,240
Then...

407
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,840
Hello. Hey, welcome.

408
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,240
It's you guys.

409
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
Welcome.

410
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,440
I hear you're a well-known detective here in Beika City.

411
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,840
Yes, sort of...

412
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,440
Shouldn't I be well-known throughout the nation?

413
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,140
Your shop is new,

414
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,240
but things look exactly the same as they were before.

415
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,540
Something did change.

416
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,340
The signboard in front.

417
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,940
The owner arranged it to suit the latest trend.

418
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,740
The signboard?

419
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
"Wicked"

420
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,040
"So wicked it's to die for" "Ramen Ogura"

421
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,240
"So wicked it's to die for"?

422
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,240
One day, a powerful rival suddenly might appear, you know?

423
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Oh, no.

424
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,340
Great moves.

425
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,240
No, this was most likely...

426
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,140
Murder...

427
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,940
you say,

428
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,240
Conan?

429
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,240
Next Conan,

430
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,240
"Deduction Showdown at the Haunted Hotel (Part 1)"

431
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:18,409
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:20,409
"Elevator".

433
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:22,609
In the next episode, a new detective-like character will appear.

434
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:23,809
But aren't I more than enough?

435
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,209
No, not at all, I'm a bit uneasy.
