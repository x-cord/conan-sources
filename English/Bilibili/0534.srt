1
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:03,532
Two people were killed 20 years ago

2
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:05,532
and one was killed 15 years ago

3
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:07,732
in a serial killing incident.

4
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:10,632
The culprit also ran over Police Detective Morimura

5
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:13,732
who stopped him for questioning and killed him.

6
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:15,732
The culprit wounded the then,

7
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:17,432
assistant inspector Matsumoto in the left eye.

8
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:20,032
The valid date for the incident that happened

9
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,132
20 years ago had already expired,

10
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:24,032
And, there are only three more days to go

11
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:27,232
before the incident that happened 15 years will also expire.

12
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:29,832
There are two clues leading to the culprit.

13
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,832
One is the straight-lined scar

14
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,132
that Superintendent Matsumoto had left

15
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,432
on the back of the culprit.

16
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,632
The other is the whistling.

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:42,132
He kept whistling a song that was popular 20 years ago.

18
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:46,132
While Officer Takagi and the others were doing their best investigating,

19
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,032
criminal psychologist, Mr. Douji Hiramune

20
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,132
continued to make provoking statements

21
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:54,232
to the culprit on air and in magazines.

22
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:55,832
And...

23
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:59,632
I passed a weird guy at the entrance.

24
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:02,132
He was wearing an off-season long coat

25
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:04,032
and whistling a tune.

26
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:09,932
Did the serial killer really come?

27
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:14,132
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

28
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:16,432
Saturday nights are for mystery.

29
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:18,432
You're not your usual self, Officer Takagi.

30
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:20,532
Heading straight to arrest the culprit?

31
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,132
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,032
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:26,032
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,459
"A New Scar and the Whistling Man"

35
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:16,359
Really, Conan?

36
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,959
Is it true that there is a possibility

37
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,859
that the serial killer came to that condo?

38
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,059
I heard that the criminal psychologist

39
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,259
named Mr. Hiramune who was on TV a while ago

40
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,059
"Hiramune" -lives in this condo.

41
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:31,459
I'm going over to that person's place!

42
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:32,859
Wait, Conan!

43
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,359
Conan!

44
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:36,159
Officer Chiba, will you go get the car.

45
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,159
Yes.

46
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,659
"Hiramune"

47
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,459
There's no answer.

48
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,559
It's open.

49
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,259
Mr. Hiramune.

50
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,459
Are you there?

51
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,659
Mr. Hiramune.

52
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,259
Mr. Hiramune.

53
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,259
No good.

54
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:18,659
There's blood on his Polo shirt?

55
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,059
"Z"?

56
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,559
The man who was murdered is criminal psychologist,

57
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,259
Mr. Douji Hiramune, age 41.

58
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,559
The murder weapon is the fruit knife

59
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,859
that was in the kitchen here.

60
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,759
There's a trace of a stun gun

61
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,559
having been stuck out at the back of his neck.

62
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,159
Judging from the alphabet that is carved on his back,

63
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,259
this is likely the doings

64
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,159
of the same serial killer of all the other cases.

65
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:47,259
But the letter this time is "Z".

66
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,659
I also thought that the next letter would be "N".

67
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,559
According to the investigation reports

68
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:58,059
the letters in the order of E, S, and W

69
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,859
were carved on the bodies of the victims.

70
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:00,959
Therefore, if the next letter is "N",

71
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,659
it would complete the four cardinal directions.

72
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,459
But, if the letters symbolize the four cardinal directions,

73
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,059
it would be east, west, south, north.

74
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,859
So the order of the letters should be E, W, S, N.

75
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:17,459
Well, it's for certain that this is not the doings of a copycat.

76
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,459
It hasn't been publicized that letters

77
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,359
are carved on the bodies of the victims and besides,

78
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,959
Conan's friend seems to have mentioned

79
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,859
passing a man at the entrance who was whistling.

80
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:30,959
But, no matter if he knew about the case,

81
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,259
to think that after hearing from his friend

82
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,959
about a man who was whistling

83
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,159
it's amazing that you would sense that Mr. Hiramune

84
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,759
who had been bad-mouthing the killer would be in danger,

85
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,559
and run in here first thing.

86
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:46,859
You're running around like a full fledged detective as always, Conan.

87
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,259
Did he bad-mouth the killer that badly?

88
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,359
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,459
He would say things like the killer is trembling

90
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,859
waiting for his term to expire.

91
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,959
Or, if he's got the guts, to come out and appear before him.

92
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,659
It's as if he's provoking the killer.

93
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:03,859
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,659
Mr. Hiramatsu also repeatedly bashed the killer

95
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,059
likewise in the papers and weekly magazines too.

96
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:12,859
It seems that Mr. Hiramune rushed home

97
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,859
after finishing his live appearance at a TV station.

98
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:18,459
He seems to have waiting for an acquaintance to come to his place.

99
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,359
I guess we could deem that acquaintance

100
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,459
of his to be a suspect.

101
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:25,259
He could be someone connected with copy machines or something.

102
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,359
See, under Mr. Hiramune's left hand.

103
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:34,759
There's blood on the Ctrl key and C key.

104
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,459
If you press these two key,

105
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,059
you can copy something right?

106
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:40,759
That's true.

107
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,159
Maybe the killer left it there deliberately.

108
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:48,559
But, there's no blood on his left hand, right?

109
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,659
True.

110
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,759
Blood for some reason is only on his right hand

111
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,159
where he's holding the mouse.

112
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,559
Which means that blood was put on the key with his right hand,

113
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:00,759
which after he went out of his way to cover it with his left hand, right?

114
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,259
If the killer left it deliberately,

115
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,159
do you think he would do something like this?

116
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,559
Right.

117
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,459
I think he would leave something that is more conspicuous behind.

118
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,859
He didn't put the blood on with his left hand

119
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:14,459
to make it look like it wasn't a coincidence.

120
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,459
He hid it with his left hand

121
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,659
because he didn't want to show it to the killer.

122
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,359
In other words, Mr. Hiramune,

123
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:27,159
at the moment of his death left a dying message.

124
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,259
There is a copy machine in this room but...

125
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,859
I checked a while ago,

126
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:35,059
but nothing looked strange.

127
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:37,759
Could it be a coy band or something?

128
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,159
The tune the suspect was whistling was a song

129
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,859
that was popular 20 years ago, right?

130
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:45,559
It could be a band that is covering that tune.

131
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,659
There are a million bands that would doing something like that.

132
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,759
Superintendent Matsumoto.

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
-Sir. -Sir.

134
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,959
It was the song of the times back then.

135
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,859
Well, it seems to hold a deep meaning for the killer though.

136
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,459
Deep meaning?

137
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,859
Do you know that 20 years ago

138
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,959
Morimura went to question the person

139
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,859
in a suspicious car that he frequently saw

140
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:12,859
and died on duty when he was run over by that car?

141
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,859
It seems that the man was whistling that tune

142
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:19,959
even as Morimura approached the car.

143
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,559
And the man was in tears.

144
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,259
Tears?

145
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,459
Okay.

146
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:28,259
Sato and Chiba, go question people in this vicinity.

147
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,259
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

148
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,459
Shiratori, keep the copy machine in mind

149
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,359
and go check around Mr. HIramune once more.

150
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,759
That's just what I plan to do.

151
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,659
Takagi, just to be safe,

152
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,059
go meet the bereaved families of the victims

153
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,259
of the past three cases,

154
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,959
and check to see if they had any kind of connection

155
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,959
with Mr. Hiramune.

156
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,059
Yes, sir! Roger!

157
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,659
So enthusiastic.

158
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,759
Maybe it worked a bit too effectively.

159
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,359
The murder case that had only three days to go before expiration.

160
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:03,459
Now with a new murder committed by the same killer,

161
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,059
has 15 more years to go before expiration.

162
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,159
Oh no.

163
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,759
The Criminal Procedure Act was revised

164
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,159
and the new expiration date for murders cases is 25 years.

165
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,959
If we can only nab this killer

166
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,959
within the 25 years we from now.

167
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,059
I get to go with Ms. Sato, just the two of us...

168
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,759
to the hot spring!

169
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,259
I see.

170
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,759
That's why he's more out to get than always.

171
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,359
His motive's impure.

172
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,259
A hot spring, how nice.

173
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,059
Take us with you too.

174
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,559
Why are you guys in this car?

175
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,059
You let us on yourself!

176
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,659
In the parking lot, we asked you, "Where are you going?"

177
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,859
and you opened the door without saying anything.

178
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,659
You didn't look like you were all there, though.

179
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,859
Well... my head was filled with thoughts about the hot spring.

180
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:02,259
No, I mean the case so...

181
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,459
And what do you intend to do?

182
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,959
Are you going to take us with you?

183
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,559
Or, are you going to let us down?

184
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,359
Of course I'm going to let you all down.

185
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:15,459
But Ayumi and Ai passed by the killer, you know.

186
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,259
But, I'm headed for the houses of the bereaved families of the victims

187
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,259
of the cases 20 and 15 years ago.

188
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,059
But, I heard them say on TV that the bereaved families

189
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,559
are also being suspected as suspects.

190
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,759
True, but...

191
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,759
Well, if you intend to wait 25 years

192
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,259
for Officer Sato who'll turn 50

193
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:39,559
and become a super over the hill mature woman,

194
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,259
you can try handling everything alone.

195
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,859
-Super over the hill mature. -Super over the hill mature.

196
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,659
She's just great now though.

197
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,359
She's beautiful too!

198
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,359
She sure is a buy, I'd say.

199
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:57,059
Listen, the only one who gets out of the car is Conan.

200
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,659
The rest of you stay put in the car, all right?

201
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,959
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir...

202
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,559
The person we're about to meet now

203
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,659
is the wife of Mr. Tsuguharu Bokawa, a doctor,

204
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:14,059
the first victim who was killed 20 years ago, right?

205
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,159
"Bokawa General Hospital" -Yes. Mr. Bokawa was the head of a hospital,

206
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,259
and his wife Maiko inherited a great amount of estate,

207
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,959
so she was taken up as a suspect.

208
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,459
But, no concrete evidence

209
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,859
was found nor did she have anything connecting her

210
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:33,459
with Mr. Mugita, the second victim who was killed.

211
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,059
Yes. I know this person.

212
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,859
He's Mr. Hiramune, the criminal psychologist

213
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:45,459
"Maiko Bokawa (62)" -that appears on TV frequently, isn't he?

214
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,659
What about him?

215
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,659
He was found killed in his condo just a while ago.

216
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,759
Most probably by the same killer who killed your husband 20 years ago.

217
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,659
My, how frightening.

218
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,559
So, I'm wondering if your husband

219
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,459
was in any way connected to Mr. Hiramune.

220
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,859
I wonder how old is Mr. Hiramune?

221
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,759
41 years old.

222
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,759
Then, 20 years ago he was 21 years old

223
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,859
and my husband died when he was 50.

224
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:20,959
It's hard for me to believe that they were connected in any way.

225
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,559
I see.

226
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,659
Did he ever meet anyone in secret?

227
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,059
Who is he, this boy?

228
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,159
I'm watching the officer on duty for social studies.

229
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,759
Oh, is that so.

230
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,859
But, it's true that he used to frequently drink

231
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,759
with someone on Saturday nights.

232
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,259
Do you have any idea who it was?

233
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,659
No.

234
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,559
Only, there was a time when he came home totally wasted back then.

235
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:54,659
"Darn! How dare he call me cry baby, cry baby and make fun of me!"

236
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,959
He kept complaining.

237
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,059
It could've been an old friend of his

238
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,459
that knew him since he was child.

239
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,859
I told the police about this 20 years ago too.

240
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,459
"For pedestrians and bicycles only"

241
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,059
The next one we're visiting

242
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:15,259
is the house of a victim that was killed 20 years ago too.

243
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,059
He is the younger brother of the Assistant Professor

244
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,359
of the science and technology department,

245
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,759
Mr. Atsunori Mugita, who was killed 2 days after Mr. Bokawa,

246
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,359
He was suspected because his older brother

247
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,359
was covered by a huge insurance policy.

248
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,959
But, no connection was found between him

249
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,359
and the victim of the first case.

250
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,959
What about with the lawyer in the third case?

251
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,759
Of course, it seems they found no connection.

252
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,659
Criminal psychologist, Mr. Doji Hiramune.

253
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,859
So he makes...

254
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,559
"Hidekuni Mugita (56)" -a lot of appearances on TV shows,

255
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,459
but I don't like watching TV, you see.

256
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,659
And, Mr. Hiramune was killed.

257
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:57,159
By the same killer that killed your brother Atsunori.

258
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,459
Aren't you shocked?

259
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,759
Well, sort of.

260
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,859
But, I've made up my mind to forget about that case 5 years ago

261
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,959
when it expired.

262
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,559
Then, do you know if your brother and Mr. Hiramune knew each other?

263
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,359
I wonder but I don't think so.

264
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,659
Saturday night.

265
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,959
Did you brother meet with anyone on Saturday nights?

266
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,459
Yes. The wife of my late brother

267
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,859
who died the year before last used to say

268
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:36,959
that he didn't come home on Saturday nights,

269
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,659
but rather, frequently came back the next morning.

270
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,359
Thinking that he may be having an extra-marital affair,

271
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,859
his wife persistently rang his pocket bell.

272
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:48,759
It seems that he called her back but was outraged

273
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,759
telling her that he was at the doctor so not to bug him.

274
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,959
Doctor? Could it have been Dr. Bokawa

275
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,959
who was the first person that was killed?

276
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,459
Yes. A police detective said the same thing 20 years ago

277
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,059
and seemed to be investigating the case.

278
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,759
My brother's name wasn't on the patient list of that doctor, was it?

279
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,059
I guess not.

280
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,559
How was it, Officer Takagi?

281
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,259
Did you find anything?

282
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,659
Nothing at all.

283
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,559
Ayumi and Ai, what do you think?

284
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,159
Didn't the man just now look a lot like the killer?

285
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,459
I didn't think he resembled the killer in particular.

286
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,559
I don't think lady is the killer either.

287
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,659
Well, I guess if he were wearing a long haired wig and mustache

288
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:41,559
like the time we passed him,

289
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,659
he would probably make a different impression, though.

290
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,059
True.

291
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,459
Where next?

292
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,159
The last place we're going

293
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,859
to go is to the house of Eiki Nabei,

294
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,059
the son of the lawyer, Mr. Susumu Nabei,

295
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,159
who was killed five years after the serial killings

296
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,759
that occurred 20 years ago.

297
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:13,851
Eiki who was 10 years old back then,

298
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,651
was in his room when he was awakened

299
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,151
by the sound of his father groaning.

300
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,851
And, after the killer left,

301
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:23,251
he says that he was so terrified that he couldn't come of his room

302
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:25,751
until his mother came back from shopping.

303
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,751
His mother, after finding her husband lying dead

304
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,551
became bed-ridden because of the shock,

305
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:32,251
and still seems to be in the hospital even now.

306
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:36,851
So, Eiki seems to be living alone in that house now.

307
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:39,451
Will you please give me a break, officer!

308
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,651
I've talked more than enough about the incident in the past!

309
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,251
"Eiki Nabei (25)" -I'm sick and tired of the media coming after me

310
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,551
saying that the case is about to expire and all!

311
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,151
I could care less if the killer

312
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:53,751
who killed my father is going after a new target!

313
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,051
Then, then...

314
00:16:56,051 --> 00:17:00,651
At least please tell me if your father knew Mr. Hiramune...

315
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:02,651
Who knows? Stupid!

316
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:03,951
Stupid?

317
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:12,651
It seems he wasn't like that before.

318
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:13,751
Really?

319
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:14,751
Yes.

320
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,351
According to the police,

321
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,151
be it about what happened on the day of the incident

322
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,551
or the strange thing that his father was saying

323
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,251
before he was killed.

324
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,951
He used to come to the police

325
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,951
and report every little thing he remembered.

326
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:28,851
Strange thing?

327
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,551
It seems he used to sleep till noon on Sundays,

328
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,551
and mumble when he got up.

329
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,351
"I had a tough time last night because the dealer (head of the house)

330
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:39,151
went out with a big hand!(was run over)"

331
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:42,351
So, somebody's parent was run over by a car.

332
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:45,651
I see, after all, he was a lawyer.

333
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,151
He must've been handling the case of either

334
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,451
the plaintiff or the defendant.

335
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,951
So? How does that end up being a strange story?

336
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,051
Well, Mr. Nabei who was killed specialized in business law

337
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:00,251
and didn't handle cases having to do with traffic accidents.

338
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,751
Then, why?

339
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,551
That's why Eiki thought it strange

340
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,451
and reported it to the police.

341
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,551
A cry baby.

342
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,951
At the doctor.

343
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:16,251
The dealer goes out.

344
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:18,751
So, I see.

345
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:23,351
I've finally figured out

346
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,851
the connection of the four victims.

347
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:26,851
What?

348
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,651
Mahjong?

349
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:35,851
Are you saying that the thing in common all the four people

350
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,851
who were killed had is mahjong?

351
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:42,151
Mr. Hiramune said on the wide show on TV, didn't he?

352
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:44,151
That "it's all last",

353
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:47,351
or he was getting rid of "anko" to finish that round of the game.

354
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:50,651
These are all terminology used in mahjong, aren't they?

355
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:54,051
I'm sure that Mr. Hiramune loves mahjong.

356
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:58,051
I... I guess so, but what about the other three?

357
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:01,651
As to Mr. Bokawa, who was the first one killed,

358
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,351
when he came home drunk on Saturday night complaining,

359
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,751
"How dare they make fun of me calling me cry baby."

360
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:11,451
Assistant professor, Mugita of the science and technology department,

361
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,751
after being called on his beeper by his wife,

362
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,151
retuned her call shouting,

363
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:20,351
"I'm almost ready to win the game. Don't bug me!"

364
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:22,151
Lawyer Nabei seems to have slept frequently till noon on Sundays,

365
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,751
and when he got up would mumble,

366
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:30,551
"The dealer won the game with a big hand, right?"

367
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,951
When Mr. Bokawa said they called him a cry baby,

368
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,851
it meant that he'd frequently pick up the tiles of other people

369
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,751
-and display part of his hand in the game. -Why does he have to cry?

370
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,951
It's a game called Mahjong, isn't it?

371
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:42,551
To cry, "naku" is when a person,

372
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,751
in order to win the game as soon as possible,

373
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,151
picks a tile that someone disposes of on the table up

374
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,751
to make a pair of threes or fours.

375
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,951
Which means that phrase that Mr. Nabei mentioned about,

376
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,251
"I was in a fix because the parent was run over" was...

377
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:58,251
Maybe that phrase, "The parent was run over" was taken mistakenly

378
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:01,151
by his the son, Eiki?

379
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,551
"Parent" means the dealer of the mahjong game

380
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,751
who gets to score a lot of points.

381
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:06,851
"Run over" means the points of the person

382
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:08,751
who wins the game gets higher.

383
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:10,651
It means that a hand called "Haneman" is played and the player wins.

384
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,751
So, he meant, the dealer won with a high point,

385
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:16,351
which put him a fix.

386
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,551
Then what does Mr. Mugita's remark,

387
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,251
"I'm at the doctor now" mean?

388
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,851
He probably said,

389
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,451
"I'll be winning the game with just two more tiles now!

390
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:28,951
Don't bother me!"

391
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,251
True.

392
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:34,051
It sounds like "I'm at the doctor now" to me, though.

393
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:37,251
What does that means?

394
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:41,551
When you need only two more tiles to go win the game,

395
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,651
you call it "Iishanten"!

396
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,251
In other words, he's angry and saying,

397
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,451
"I'm almost ready to win the game,

398
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:50,551
so don't call me on the beeper and bother me"

399
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:54,051
Well, all the terminologies used are for mahjong,

400
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:56,751
so if a person who never played mahjong heard wrong,

401
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,551
it's understandable.

402
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,151
True.

403
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:02,451
Because the ones who heard so, were Mrs. Bohkawa,

404
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:09,351
Mrs. Mugita and Mr. Nabei's son, Eiki who was still a child.

405
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,551
If you think of it that way,

406
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,751
the remark the culprit spit out,

407
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,151
that Eiki heard was about mahjong too, then.

408
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:15,551
Remark he spit out?

409
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:21,151
It seems that Eiki heard the words of the culprit who left the house.

410
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:22,851
You're just paying me to take responsibility,

411
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,751
so don't blame it on me.

412
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,751
You're to blame for doing something like that.

413
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:34,251
I was cornered by the police who left this big scar on me.

414
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,551
Taking responsibility (sekininbarai) and cornered (tenpai)

415
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,651
are also words used in mahjong.

416
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:41,951
And? What from there?

417
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,651
What else?

418
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:45,451
There's a very high possibility

419
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:46,751
that the four were sitting around

420
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,251
a mahjong table somewhere every Saturday.

421
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:50,451
Narrow the mahjong parlours down

422
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:53,251
to ones that the four could've dropped by from their houses

423
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:57,251
or work place 20 years ago and ask around.

424
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,851
As far as mahjong is concerned,

425
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,451
people can play together

426
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:04,151
no matter what the difference in age is.

427
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,251
Okay!

428
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:12,251
Youth Detective Squad! Let's go!

429
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:15,651
It's getting late, you know. Is it okay?

430
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,651
It's already 9 pm.

431
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,951
Yeah, don't worry about it.

432
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:22,251
I told mother that I'd be spending the night at doctor's house tonight.

433
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,551
No problem.

434
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,851
Really?

435
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:29,851
Okay! Let's get going!

436
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,151
Aye!

437
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:39,051
Hold on, whistling man.

438
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,451
I'll expose you're true identity for sure.

439
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,451
His address is unknown and he's unemployed.

440
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:07,851
His name is...

441
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,551
Dokuro Kibo.

442
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:13,751
The letter Z that was left on Mr. Hiramune's back's bugging me.

443
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,751
So that person is a cat.

444
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:20,351
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him.

445
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:24,851
Listen! Life is lost in a split second.

446
00:24:24,851 --> 00:24:28,551
I guess I'm the only hostage left.

447
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,051
Next Conan,

448
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,951
"An Old Scar and the Soul of a Detective"

449
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,451
Next Conan's Hint:

450
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,051
"Mouse".

451
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,951
Why do they call it a mouse?

452
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:57,451
You'll find out next episode.

453
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,039
Genta, your mouth looks funny.
