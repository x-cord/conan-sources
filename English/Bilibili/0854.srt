1
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.370
No way!

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.670
So Shinichi acted like he solved the mystery of the cherry blossom badge

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.870
through reasoning when he actually just saw what happened?

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.070
Maybe.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.970
Back then I was surprised and thought he was a genius.

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.170
I want him to give me back how I felt for him.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.470
Well, I think that he just wanted to look good in front of girls.

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.570
And I think he also wanted to save Ran from the bullies, too.

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.970
Stupid.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.470
What I saw through the window back then

11
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.470
was a girl in a fix because something was taken from her

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.670
and the phrase, "You're not one of us."

13
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.770
So what I saw back then

14
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.070
was what I encountered for the first time.

15
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.770
My heart was beating when I was solving the riddle.

16
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.470
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

17
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.570
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

18
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.370
Sakura Class is where I encountered Ran.

19
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.870
Behind the shadows of tears is the conspiracy of adults.

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.570
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.270
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:54.011 --> 00:03:00.011
"Memories of Sakura Class (Shinichi Boy)"

24
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:04.311
Then, I'll stop over there on my way to take Shinichi to the nursery

25
00:03:04.311 --> 00:03:05.711
so wait there for us, okay?

26
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.311
Don't forget to wear your hat and sunglasses when you come, okay?

27
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.111
You'll cause a commotion if people know it's you.

28
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:12.511
Okay.

29
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:14.911
Let's go then, Shinichi.

30
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.311
Shinichi?

31
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:20.811
Hey, where are you?

32
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:24.311
Remove all the deduction from the middle

33
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.911
and present only the start and answer to your counterpart,

34
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.411
although it isn't very sophisticated,

35
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:32.211
it is enough to surprise people!

36
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.811
Found you. There you are!

37
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:39.111
Come on. What do you think you're doing?

38
00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:42.211
But I haven't finished reading this book yet!

39
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:45.711
I told you we're going to your new nursery school from today, didn't I?

40
00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:48.311
We don't need to go there!

41
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.811
Besides, reading books in a dark place like that,

42
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:54.711
you're going to have to use glasses just like Yusaku!

43
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:59.411
I'll never wear glasses. No way.

44
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:06.311
It's Yukiko Fujimine!

45
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:10.011
How strange. I've got my hat and sunglasses on.

46
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:15.811
Right, ones that scream that you're an actress.

47
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:19.511
Here. This is the name tag for the Sakura Class.

48
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:22.811
Now, stop stealing the spotlight at my event.

49
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.111
Copy.

50
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:28.911
Then Shinichi, after putting this on your chest we're splitting!

51
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.411
Okay. I know.

52
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:33.811
"Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class"

53
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:36.411
Mrs. Kudo.

54
00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:39.911
The last thing I'd like to ask about is allergies.

55
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.811
Are there any things he shouldn't be fed?

56
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.811
Like eggs, noodles or cheese?

57
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:49.211
No, nothing in particular.

58
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.811
He doesn't like raisins.

59
00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:52.211
He hates them.

60
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.011
Let's see.

61
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.911
Where is the library?

62
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:19.111
Seriously?

63
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:21.311
They don't have a library.

64
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:34.211
What's this? Everybody's lined up sleeping?

65
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.111
I thought it was a morgue

66
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.411
like the one I saw in that movie the other day.

67
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:44.911
This row is the Apple Class.

68
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:47.811
The next row is the Tulip Class.

69
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:50.911
And the row at the very top

70
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:52.611
is the Sakura Class.

71
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:55.211
Okay, good children, good children.

72
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:07.811
That girl had something taken from her and was in a fix.

73
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.511
Only her clothes don't have a name tag on it.

74
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:14.911
So her name tag was probably taken from her.

75
00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:18.111
But what is it that she's making now?

76
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:22.011
Wait a sec.

77
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:23.811
I've seen that way of folding before!

78
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:31.611
I think it was the way Dad folded the paper to make a star

79
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.311
to decorate on the Christmas tree.

80
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.311
Back then, Dad cut the paper straight diagonally

81
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.111
and it turned into a star.

82
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.511
If you bend it and cut like she did...

83
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:45.011
it's a cherry blossom!

84
00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:46.611
I'm convinced!

85
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.211
Since her name tag was taken from her a while ago,

86
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:52.111
she's making a new name tag with paper.

87
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.611
Darn it.

88
00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:56.311
I want to ask her if I'm right.

89
00:06:56.311 --> 00:07:00.511
Holmes said if one simply knocks out all the deduction from the middle

90
00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:03.611
and present only the start and answer to your counterpart,

91
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:05.211
although it isn't very sophisticated,

92
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:08.611
it is enough to surprise people!

93
00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:11.411
I wonder if she'd be surprised.

94
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:14.011
I wonder if she'll think that I'm amazing and be surprised.

95
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:17.611
No, wrong.

96
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:20.611
You're not one of us because yours is different from ours!

97
00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:23.311
The thing was taken from her

98
00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:25.711
wasn't this plastic badge!

99
00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.011
I finished making it!

100
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.911
Make one for me, too.

101
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.611
That's a cherry blossom, right?

102
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:37.311
What's that puzzled look on your face?

103
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.011
Don't tell me that you...

104
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:40.411
Am I wrong?

105
00:07:40.411 --> 00:07:42.111
It is, but...

106
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:43.611
How did you know?

107
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:45.111
I was right!

108
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.911
What do you mean how?

109
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:49.511
Are you making fun of me, or what?

110
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:53.511
All I have left to do is to explain how I knew it.

111
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:56.711
I'm sure that she'll be surprised.

112
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.811
That's how I know

113
00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:02.811
that you lost your cherry blossom name tag

114
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:07.511
and was making your tag while crying your eyes out like a cry-baby!

115
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:10.011
Okay, how's that?

116
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.811
Did I surprise you like Watson?

117
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:14.411
Did you think I was amazing?

118
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:19.811
Everybody's surprised.

119
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:21.011
Fantastic.

120
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:23.111
Holmes is fantastic!

121
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:24.711
You're really something!

122
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:26.611
Like some psychic!

123
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:29.311
Stupid. I'm no psychic.

124
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:33.011
So, I'm sure she's also surprised.

125
00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:34.311
She's angry?

126
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:36.511
I'm not a cry-baby either!

127
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:39.711
But you were crying.

128
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:40.911
I wasn't crying!

129
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:43.111
You were crying.

130
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:44.911
No, I wasn't!

131
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:47.911
I mean, you're in tears now.

132
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:50.111
Shinichi, there you are!

133
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:54.111
Don't go running off when I'm filing out your admission papers.

134
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.711
Mom.

135
00:08:56.711 --> 00:09:00.011
What happened to your name tag?

136
00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:02.511
You had it on your chest till just a while ago!

137
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:03.911
I lost it somewhere.

138
00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:08.211
The cherry blossom name tag that I hid in my pocket,

139
00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:10.611
I've got to make sure it won't be found.

140
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:17.711
What's with him?

141
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:19.011
Who is he looking at?

142
00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:23.011
Her.

143
00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:26.811
But why?

144
00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:28.611
Mrs. Kudo?

145
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:30.511
If you can't find the name tag,

146
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:35.511
we'll get one ready for you together with Ran's by next week.

147
00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:36.711
Oh, really?

148
00:09:36.711 --> 00:09:39.511
Hey, if you want a cherry blossom,

149
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.611
I'll give you this that I made a while ago.

150
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:43.211
Oh, okay.

151
00:09:43.211 --> 00:09:45.811
I'll write your name for you, too.

152
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:47.211
What's your name?

153
00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:51.911
Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class!

154
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:54.911
Shinichi...

155
00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:57.411
Kudo.

156
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:01.211
Thanks.

157
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:03.911
Here, all done!

158
00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:06.411
"Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class"

159
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:11.811
I'll give you that so promise, okay?

160
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:15.911
I'm not a cry-baby!

161
00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:18.111
Don't ever call me a cry-baby again!

162
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.611
There, there.

163
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:22.811
Both of you, no fighting!

164
00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:26.811
Shinichi, don't call her a cry-baby anymore.

165
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:28.911
Who are you?

166
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:31.111
I'm Ronsuke Efune.

167
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:33.311
Your homeroom teacher.

168
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:34.911
Nice to meet you.

169
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:37.111
Nice to meet you, too.

170
00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:48.478
Something is really strange about him!

171
00:10:48.478 --> 00:10:50.678
I'm positively sure!

172
00:10:50.678 --> 00:10:54.478
Him? You mean Mr. Efune from nursery school?

173
00:10:54.478 --> 00:10:56.678
Strange? How?

174
00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:59.578
During nap time,

175
00:10:59.578 --> 00:11:02.078
only the place where she puts her futon is always the same.

176
00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:04.878
During the walks,

177
00:11:04.878 --> 00:11:07.378
he holds her hand the whole time.

178
00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:10.678
Even at the sliding board of the park we went for a walk,

179
00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:12.778
there were others waiting in line,

180
00:11:12.778 --> 00:11:15.178
but he skipped them and made her use the sliding board first.

181
00:11:15.178 --> 00:11:17.478
He calls out her name really loud, too.

182
00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:21.078
I'm sure he's trying to win her over

183
00:11:21.078 --> 00:11:23.078
so that she'll listen to whatever he tells her to do.

184
00:11:25.378 --> 00:11:28.178
Who are you referring to?

185
00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:30.678
She's...

186
00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:35.378
A girl named Ran.

187
00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:42.378
Shinichi, I'll bet you're jealous

188
00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:44.678
because that teacher favors only Ran?

189
00:11:44.678 --> 00:11:46.578
Are you stupid?

190
00:11:46.578 --> 00:11:48.078
It's nothing like that!

191
00:11:48.078 --> 00:11:50.378
You're totally off!

192
00:11:50.378 --> 00:11:54.678
But it is a problem for a teacher to favor just one student, though.

193
00:11:54.678 --> 00:11:56.778
Did you ask the teacher the reason?

194
00:11:56.778 --> 00:11:57.778
Yes.

195
00:11:57.778 --> 00:11:59.078
About her futon,

196
00:11:59.078 --> 00:12:02.678
he said that in the past she didn't make it to the restroom in time

197
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:04.678
because she was sleeping some distance away,

198
00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:07.078
and that's why he put her nearest to the restroom.

199
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.378
The reason he hold hands with her during the walk

200
00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:13.578
is because she's terribly bad at directions

201
00:12:13.578 --> 00:12:17.078
and went somewhere way off away from the others.

202
00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:21.778
He also said that since she always gives her turns up to others

203
00:12:21.778 --> 00:12:25.378
so he let her get on the sliding board first.

204
00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.878
So he has reasons for everything.

205
00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:29.078
Come to think of it,

206
00:12:29.078 --> 00:12:30.878
didn't you say that the walking course changed

207
00:12:30.878 --> 00:12:34.878
and that you started going to a different park than before?

208
00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:36.178
Oh, yes.

209
00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:39.178
He told me he'd tell me why tomorrow!

210
00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:44.378
But I think that you're jealous after all, Shinichi?

211
00:12:44.378 --> 00:12:46.778
I'm telling you that's not it!

212
00:12:46.778 --> 00:12:51.378
He definitely looks at her with the eyes of a bad guy!

213
00:12:51.378 --> 00:12:54.078
I'm not making him beat me!

214
00:12:54.078 --> 00:12:55.878
Hey, wait.

215
00:12:56.978 --> 00:12:58.478
Hey, Shinichi.

216
00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:02.778
Could it be that Ran gets up late every time?

217
00:13:02.778 --> 00:13:06.278
Right. She always fast asleep and the last one to get up.

218
00:13:09.078 --> 00:13:12.278
Yusaku, have you come up with something?

219
00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:16.278
Shinichi's homeroom teacher's name, Efune.

220
00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:19.078
I know another person by that name.

221
00:13:19.078 --> 00:13:21.678
She's this girl from Hokkaido, you see.

222
00:13:23.578 --> 00:13:25.178
"The next day" -What's the matter, Ran?

223
00:13:25.178 --> 00:13:27.178
You seem depressed.

224
00:13:27.178 --> 00:13:29.778
Mother scolded me last night.

225
00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:32.878
She told me that I shouldn't bully my friends.

226
00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.578
I'm not bullying anybody, right?

227
00:13:35.578 --> 00:13:36.678
No.

228
00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:40.278
Rather, you may be the one that's being bullied.

229
00:13:41.378 --> 00:13:43.478
Okay, everyone. Be careful.

230
00:13:59.478 --> 00:14:04.578
Besides, the main reason I chose this park is her.

231
00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:07.878
She's actually my wife.

232
00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:09.378
What? Your wife?

233
00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:10.878
You mean she's your bride?

234
00:14:36.278 --> 00:14:40.278
"Two days later"

235
00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:14.478
-What? A black van? -Yes.

236
00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:17.478
It's been parked outside the rear exit of the nursery school for a while.

237
00:15:17.478 --> 00:15:22.078
I wonder if things like these should be reported to the police?

238
00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:23.378
That's right.

239
00:15:23.378 --> 00:15:26.878
I think we should write down its license plate number just in case, too.

240
00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:31.078
In that case, should I go check things out?

241
00:15:31.078 --> 00:15:32.578
Mr. Efune.

242
00:15:32.578 --> 00:15:34.478
Could you do that then?

243
00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:36.378
Please be careful!

244
00:15:38.978 --> 00:15:42.078
Forget it. She's not coming back anymore.

245
00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:45.078
No, that's not true! That's not true!

246
00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:47.878
Then, what do you want to do about it?

247
00:15:47.878 --> 00:15:49.678
I want to reset things.

248
00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:52.378
Then, I'm sure everything will work out this time.

249
00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:53.678
It won't do.

250
00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:58.278
There's no time constraint to start over.

251
00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:01.478
Let's not go through with it after all!

252
00:16:01.478 --> 00:16:04.278
Let's not stand in the rain and talk.

253
00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:05.778
Please come and sit in the passenger's seat.

254
00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:07.578
Who are you?

255
00:16:09.278 --> 00:16:11.578
I'm just an ordinary novelist

256
00:16:11.578 --> 00:16:13.578
that has just started selling recently.

257
00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:16.878
A novelist?

258
00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:18.178
Where is he?

259
00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:21.078
This is my brother-in-law's van.

260
00:16:21.078 --> 00:16:23.278
Oh, he...

261
00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:27.378
was trying to sneak in to the nursery from the window of the bathroom,

262
00:16:27.378 --> 00:16:31.278
but was nabbed by a police detective friend of mine

263
00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:35.278
and is undergoing interrogation now.

264
00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:38.278
For suspicion of breaking and entering

265
00:16:38.278 --> 00:16:40.678
and attempted kidnapping of a toddler.

266
00:16:43.078 --> 00:16:46.978
He tried to kidnap a girl named Ran Mouri,

267
00:16:46.978 --> 00:16:51.878
and he is your wife's blood related younger brother.

268
00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:56.578
In order to let her younger brother know which child he should kidnap,

269
00:16:56.578 --> 00:16:59.778
you held the child's hand.

270
00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:01.478
And to make your wife confirm

271
00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.778
whether that girl was really who she wanted,

272
00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:06.078
you called the child's name out loud

273
00:17:06.078 --> 00:17:08.078
and put her on the sliding board

274
00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:09.778
to bring her closer up to the window of the hospital,

275
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.378
so she could get a good view of the child.

276
00:17:12.378 --> 00:17:16.078
You made her lay the futon near the restroom

277
00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:20.278
so that she'd be closest when the perp broke into the bathroom.

278
00:17:21.478 --> 00:17:24.578
Wasn't the reason for putting her futon near the restroom

279
00:17:24.578 --> 00:17:26.578
was because she wet herself?

280
00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:28.478
Probably because you'd been slipping her sedatives

281
00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:31.678
so she'd be easier to kidnap?

282
00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:34.478
If you administer a sleeping drug to children it will make them drowsy

283
00:17:34.478 --> 00:17:40.578
leading them to do things that are against their will, you see.

284
00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:42.978
Yes. It was all to make it look

285
00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:45.878
as if you were favoring just that girl

286
00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:48.478
so the other children would resent her

287
00:17:48.478 --> 00:17:52.478
and start bullying her.

288
00:17:52.478 --> 00:17:55.578
Moreover, as to the communication book,

289
00:17:55.578 --> 00:17:58.678
you wrote in that she was bullying other children.

290
00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:00.678
As a result, her parents would scold her for something that she didn't do.

291
00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:05.178
So you'd become the only person she could depend on.

292
00:18:05.178 --> 00:18:06.478
In other words,

293
00:18:06.478 --> 00:18:08.878
you were trying to win that girl over

294
00:18:08.878 --> 00:18:11.378
so that you would be able to live happily with her

295
00:18:11.378 --> 00:18:14.078
even after kidnapping her.

296
00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:16.878
It's just as my son had deduced.

297
00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:18.578
Son?

298
00:18:18.578 --> 00:18:19.678
Yes.

299
00:18:19.678 --> 00:18:24.178
You were planning to spend more time to win her over,

300
00:18:24.178 --> 00:18:28.278
but since my son almost found out, you speeded up your plan.

301
00:18:28.278 --> 00:18:31.978
That son of mine is now doing as I told him to,

302
00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:34.278
checking the door of the restroom

303
00:18:34.278 --> 00:18:37.978
after you came out to make sure that it's locked

304
00:18:37.978 --> 00:18:41.578
and is standing guard in the restroom right now.

305
00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:44.178
In order to protect that girl.

306
00:18:46.978 --> 00:18:50.678
My wife has come down with serious neurosis.

307
00:18:50.678 --> 00:18:54.878
That's why her younger brother as well as I...

308
00:18:54.878 --> 00:18:58.578
That's because your daughter ran away from home, correct?

309
00:18:58.578 --> 00:19:01.978
How do you know?

310
00:19:01.978 --> 00:19:07.078
Your wife probably was heartbroken by your daughter running away

311
00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:10.378
and wanted to raise a child again from preschool age,

312
00:19:10.378 --> 00:19:14.878
when your daughter was cutest.

313
00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:16.078
Yes.

314
00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:18.078
She attempted to commit suicide several times

315
00:19:18.078 --> 00:19:19.978
and became anorexic,

316
00:19:19.978 --> 00:19:23.678
and I couldn't bear watching her losing weight day by day.

317
00:19:23.678 --> 00:19:27.678
Therefore, could we leave my wife out of this?

318
00:19:27.678 --> 00:19:33.078
No, I'm sure your wife has already gone to the police

319
00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:35.178
together with your daughter.

320
00:19:35.178 --> 00:19:37.978
Together with my daughter?

321
00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:42.878
There is a girl called Efune among my fans.

322
00:19:42.878 --> 00:19:45.178
And although she is resident of Hokkaido,

323
00:19:45.178 --> 00:19:47.678
it seems she used an umbrella.

324
00:19:47.678 --> 00:19:50.678
She said it was an old habit of hers.

325
00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:54.778
People living in Hokkaido rarely use umbrellas when it snows.

326
00:19:54.778 --> 00:20:00.578
If so, it is more likely that she grew up in a place other than Hokkaido.

327
00:20:00.578 --> 00:20:04.878
Moreover, she said that the last dialogue in my novel

328
00:20:04.878 --> 00:20:08.278
of the woman detective was as if it were being said to her.

329
00:20:08.278 --> 00:20:09.278
"The Missing Body, Yusaku Kudo"

330
00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:10.878
In that novel,

331
00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:15.778
the detective finds a runaway girl who faked her suicide,

332
00:20:15.778 --> 00:20:19.778
and tells them that there's no time constraint to start over

333
00:20:19.778 --> 00:20:24.278
in order to convince her to return to her parent.

334
00:20:24.278 --> 00:20:26.878
If those words moved her,

335
00:20:26.878 --> 00:20:30.278
I figured maybe she was also a runaway.

336
00:20:31.378 --> 00:20:33.778
If you want to see your daughter,

337
00:20:33.778 --> 00:20:35.578
go on and turn yourself in, too.

338
00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:41.578
Before my friends who are staking out get impatient.

339
00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:44.878
The following day,

340
00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:48.678
it was announced that Mr. Efune quit of his own convenience

341
00:20:48.678 --> 00:20:50.878
and surprised the children.

342
00:20:50.878 --> 00:20:55.078
The children who liked Mr. Efune were practically all crying.

343
00:20:57.078 --> 00:20:58.078
Hey, listen.

344
00:20:59.278 --> 00:21:03.478
I think it's okay to cry when you want to, Ran.

345
00:21:04.478 --> 00:21:07.478
I won't call you a cry-baby anymore.

346
00:22:43.478 --> 00:22:46.978
"I think it's okay to cry when you want to?"

347
00:22:46.978 --> 00:22:50.578
That guy is sort of cool although he's only four.

348
00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:52.578
You can say that again!

349
00:22:52.578 --> 00:22:54.178
I can't help it can't I!

350
00:22:54.178 --> 00:22:57.178
She hated being called a cry-baby.

351
00:22:57.178 --> 00:23:02.078
Which means he had fallen in first sight with Ran since way back then?

352
00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:03.378
No way.

353
00:23:03.378 --> 00:23:08.178
I'm sure that his first love was his mom who was an actress.

354
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.278
I think so, too.

355
00:23:10.578 --> 00:23:13.378
I'll bet Ran doesn't know

356
00:23:13.378 --> 00:23:15.978
that from the first day we met...

357
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:17.378
What's your name?

358
00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:20.678
Shinichi Kudo, Sakura Class!

359
00:23:22.278 --> 00:23:24.278
Shinichi...

360
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:27.078
Kudo.

361
00:23:27.078 --> 00:23:29.078
Thanks.

362
00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:33.478
Here, all done!

363
00:23:39.978 --> 00:23:45.378
I was head over heels over that smile of yours.

364
00:23:47.878 --> 00:23:51.678
I had no idea that you hated me that much though.

365
00:23:54.378 --> 00:23:56.978
"Next Episode"

366
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:59.878
Makoto, you're awesome!

367
00:23:59.878 --> 00:24:00.978
Yes, yes.

368
00:24:00.978 --> 00:24:03.178
Why aren't you wearing that belt?

369
00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:06.178
I'm old already.

370
00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:10.178
It's about time I return that black belt and retire.

371
00:24:14.678 --> 00:24:16.178
The belt's gone!

372
00:24:16.178 --> 00:24:18.478
Kyogoku, don't tell me that...

373
00:24:18.478 --> 00:24:24.462
Next Conan, "Mystery of the Missing Black Belt"

374
00:24:25.021 --> 00:24:27.421
Next Conan's Hint:

375
00:24:27.421 --> 00:24:29.621
"Karate Gi"

376
00:24:29.621 --> 00:24:31.521
Next week's episode features a black belt. Hattori's dark-skinned.

377
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:34.021
But our movie is crimson. It opens next Saturday.
