1
00:00:01,358 --> 00:00:03,358
"Teito Bank"

2
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:06,258
Since Mitsuhiko wanted to deposit his New year's allowance,

3
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:09,358
we all kept him company and came to the Teito Bank.

4
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:11,958
However, Genta comes down with a stomachache

5
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,558
from eating too much rice cake.

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,458
While waiting for Doc and Haibara to come back

7
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,658
after buying stomachache medicine,

8
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:20,758
the rest of us take Genta to the men's room, but...

9
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,058
What's going on?

10
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,658
The bank was suddenly taken over

11
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:29,758
by men wearing masks.

12
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:33,658
FBI agent Jodie coincidentally happened to be among the people

13
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,958
who are taken hostage in the bank.

14
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:42,358
She succeeds in knocking down one of the robbers

15
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,458
after luring him into the restroom.

16
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:47,458
But she is stung with a stun gun by the robbers

17
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,958
and passes out.

18
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:51,458
We come to a point where we figure

19
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,958
that the only choice we have is

20
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,858
to beat the robbers up ourselves.

21
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:58,058
It seems that they still have something up their sleeves,

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,758
but we'll nab them for sure.

23
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:05,258
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

24
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:07,858
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

25
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,858
A vicious battle with bank robbers.

26
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:11,858
What are they really after?

27
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,458
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,358
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:17,658
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:07,087
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Silence"

31
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:28,587
This foreign lady sure was a fox.

32
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,387
We could kill her off now,

33
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:35,187
but we don't want the cops hearing the gun shot

34
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,587
and storming in here.

35
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:37,687
Okay.

36
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,787
Right...

37
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:45,687
I got the money ready.

38
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,887
So could you please open the case?

39
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:51,287
Hey... is that it?

40
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:55,287
I'll bet you have a lot more stashed in a larger safe?

41
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:56,387
If you like, I can blow this place up

42
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,187
using explosives, you know!

43
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:04,087
Just be quiet and do what's written on this paper.

44
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,987
If you make noise,

45
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,587
I'm going to bust through your head.

46
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:10,987
Okay!

47
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,087
All those with no friends or acquaintances here,

48
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:17,087
come here and cover your eyes and mouth with masking tape!

49
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:19,987
We'll tie both your hands for you, get that?

50
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,487
Oh, it's me.

51
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,987
How's it on that side?

52
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,387
What the... did you regain consciousness?

53
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,987
Yeah.

54
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:46,787
But, my head's still dizzy

55
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,187
and I don't think I can walk alone yet.

56
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,687
I wish give me a hand here.

57
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:54,387
Okay.

58
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:55,387
Hang on.

59
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:59,087
Huh? What's up?

60
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,887
That guy woke up.

61
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:02,387
I'm going to go get him,

62
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,087
so take care of things here, will you.

63
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,187
Hurry, we don't have much time.

64
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:07,187
Yeah.

65
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:12,387
"Restroom"

66
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:18,087
Hey... you're still passed out.

67
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:19,887
What was that phone call a while ago, then?

68
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,587
Maybe he called from dreamland?

69
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:27,387
To let you know that a bank robbery

70
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,087
is something really not worth doing.

71
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:30,187
You brat, where'd you...

72
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,087
Hey, hold it!

73
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:37,087
Hold it!

74
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,487
You'd better hold it!

75
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,087
Or I'm going to kill you!

76
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,887
How is it, Conan?

77
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:55,187
Yeah, he passed out from a concussion.

78
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,187
Let's tie him up while we can with the toilet hose.

79
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:00,487
We did it!

80
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:03,787
Project toilet paper worked out great!

81
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:07,387
It sure was worth laying toilet paper all over the floor!

82
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:08,987
The tranquilizer gun is the ace in the hole,

83
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,687
I've got to save it for later.

84
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,687
Conan, what next?

85
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,287
What else?

86
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:17,587
We're going to call the other men

87
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,287
using his cell phone.

88
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:21,987
Because the number which displayed in the call history

89
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:23,187
right before the call I made

90
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,587
is the number of the other guy.

91
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,087
Oh, it's me.

92
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,587
How're things on that side?

93
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,887
What do you mean how are things?

94
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:35,187
Didn't I just tell you on the phone a while ago

95
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,487
that I was going to the beauty shop?

96
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:39,687
Because we're dating tonight, right?

97
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:42,087
Right, see you later then.

98
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,287
This guy called his girlfriend

99
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:48,587
just before committing the crime.

100
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,287
Gotta find another one...

101
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:51,787
All the other numbers

102
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:56,587
are mostly of the guy who's passed out in the restroom.

103
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:58,887
Hey Conan, what's up?

104
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:00,787
You've got to hurry and call him out!

105
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,787
He was saying something about not having enough time too.

106
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:04,787
Time?

107
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,387
We don't have much time.

108
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,287
Let's take off his mask and jacket

109
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,187
and seat him on the toilet seat.

110
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,187
What time is he talking about?

111
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:16,087
Are they going to be picked up by somebody?

112
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,487
Besides...

113
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,687
They're separating the customers,

114
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:21,987
putting all the friends and acquaintances together.

115
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:24,787
And they made the branch manager put the cash in the trunk alone.

116
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:27,587
Why did they divide the customers?

117
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:29,587
Why did they make the branch manager

118
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:32,487
put the cash in the trunk alone?

119
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:36,087
In the first place, why isn't this guy wearing a mask?

120
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,087
If the police charge in here,

121
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,087
his face would readily be exposed...

122
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:41,787
Don't tell me...

123
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:49,587
I'm done.

124
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,887
I see.

125
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,887
Good work.

126
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,487
Talk about taking forever.

127
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,887
The guy who went to get the man

128
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,187
who passed out in the men's room.

129
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,887
Five minutes have already gone by.

130
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,487
Let him be, we don't have time.

131
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:13,987
We've got to start finishing up the job!

132
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:14,987
"Teito Bank"

133
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,387
Everything is prepared, sir.

134
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:29,287
We're ready to go in!

135
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:30,687
Anytime!

136
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:31,987
Okay!

137
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:34,687
The technical backup team and control team

138
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,287
be ready to take action anytime!

139
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,087
-Roger! -Did the robbers make any demands?

140
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,387
Nothing, yet.

141
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,787
We've been trying to call for some time now

142
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,387
to the telephone inside the bank,

143
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:46,387
but the line's been busy.

144
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,387
Busy?

145
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:54,287
I'm sure that the police outside are wondering about us,

146
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,987
because we haven't made any demands yet.

147
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:59,987
But why didn't you just pull out the telephone line?

148
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:03,587
It's better that way.

149
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:06,287
It's better to make them think

150
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:08,787
that we're calling somebody, somewhere

151
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:11,387
and making demands.

152
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:14,687
That way we can keep them hesitating to charge in.

153
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,787
The guy who went to pick the other guy up in the toilet

154
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:19,187
hasn't come back yet.

155
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,787
Maybe he went weak in the hips

156
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:22,987
and can't bring him back alone?

157
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:25,987
The guy who's passed out is pretty fat too.

158
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,487
No problem.

159
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:29,987
You were given orders to do things right

160
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,787
just in case something out of the ordinary happened too, weren't you?

161
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,287
Besides...

162
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,887
this peppy foreign lady

163
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:43,487
who knocked that guy out in the restroom...

164
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:46,487
also going to cross over to the other world soon anyway.

165
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:52,287
You figured it out?

166
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,887
You mean you figured out what the robbers are after?

167
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:55,887
Yeah.

168
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,487
These robbers are probably...

169
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:02,487
going to disguise themselves as the hostages here

170
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:05,787
and make it out of this bank.

171
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,787
Disguise themselves as the hostages?

172
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:10,587
But, how?

173
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:13,987
You saw the robbers all dressed alike, right?

174
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,687
Yes.

175
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:20,787
And the guy who stung Jodie

176
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,387
with the stun gun and made her faint.

177
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:26,387
They all had the same mask on

178
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:29,087
and wore the same jacket.

179
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,387
The guy who was passed out in the restroom

180
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:34,387
was stripped of his clothes and mask

181
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:36,087
by the other robbers, right?

182
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:39,487
And the guy who came to pick him up

183
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,487
removed his as well.

184
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:42,687
In other words,

185
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,487
they're choosing five hostages,

186
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:47,387
the same number to cover themselves,

187
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,287
and fainting them with their stun guns.

188
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,687
After that, the robbers dress the hostages

189
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,887
as if they were themselves,

190
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:55,787
they plan to make their escape.

191
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:58,887
But, won't they be found out immediately?

192
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,887
Nope.

193
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:03,087
Since both of Jodie's hands, her eyes and mouth

194
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,687
were tied and covered with masking tape,

195
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,587
I'm sure the same goes for the other hostages.

196
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:09,587
I see!

197
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,987
If they can't see,

198
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,387
they wouldn't know what the bad guys are doing.

199
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:14,387
Yeah.

200
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,587
And besides, the fact that the robbers

201
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:19,287
were separating the hostages into those who had friends with them

202
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,187
and those who came alone,

203
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:22,787
is only further proof of that.

204
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:25,387
If the robbers choose five people from the hostages who came alone

205
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:28,687
and dress them up like robbers,

206
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,187
when all is over and done,

207
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,687
even if the five perish, no one would say anything.

208
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,887
Perish after all is over and done?

209
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:38,387
Why?

210
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:41,487
Why do you think the robbers made the branch manager alone

211
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:44,987
gather all the money there is in this bank,

212
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:47,887
and put it in the case that they brought along?

213
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:51,787
Isn't it because he knows most about this bank?

214
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:55,087
In most branches of small banks like this,

215
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,387
a hundred million yen is left in a place

216
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:57,487
where the cash is easily accessible,

217
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:59,487
and 200 million yen in the ATM.

218
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,887
There is usually a total of 300 million yen in cash.

219
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,987
To collect all that and to stuff it in a case alone

220
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,087
requires quite a lot of time.

221
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,687
Then, why did they make him do it alone?

222
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,487
They had no intention to put it in the case to begin with.

223
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,887
The content of the case is probably...

224
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,287
a bomb.

225
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,687
A bomb...

226
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:36,868
"Teito Bank"

227
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:38,468
A bomb...

228
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,268
just what do you mean?

229
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:43,968
The case with bombs will be put behind the counter.

230
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:46,768
And after the robbers put five hostages,

231
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:49,268
branch manager and Jodie to sleep,

232
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,168
they'll scatter the money that the branch manager had taken out

233
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,768
and set off the bombs.

234
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:53,868
The only thing left after the explosion

235
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:56,168
are the seven dead people

236
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,868
and money that is scattered all over.

237
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,568
To the police who enter the scene after the explosion,

238
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:04,668
it would look like the robbers tried to open the safe using explosives,

239
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:06,468
but it accidentally went off.

240
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,068
And the robbers who were carrying the explosives

241
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:12,268
got the branch manager and Jodie involved and exploded to death.

242
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:15,768
It would look like the crime didn't work out as planned.

243
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,168
Which means that the robbers...

244
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:20,768
had no intention of stealing cash?

245
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:21,868
Wrong.

246
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,368
They probably made the branch manager deposit a large sum of money

247
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:27,768
into a certain bank account by internet,

248
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:31,468
and are planning to later forward it to their own account.

249
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,368
An account some place abroad

250
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:34,968
where Japan won't be able to touch.

251
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:37,068
An intellectual crime?

252
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,868
No, they're a bunch of super amateurs.

253
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,268
Even if a total of 300 million yen were to be wired

254
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,868
to a foreign country from this bank,

255
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,968
any amount of cash exceeding five million yen that isn't accounted

256
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,068
will be stopped by law

257
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:55,268
at the foreign exchange center.

258
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,468
Some time ago, it was different,

259
00:13:58,468 --> 00:13:59,968
but since there have been a lot of swindling

260
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,568
and money laundering in recent years,

261
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:07,068
they probably planned robbing this bank sometime in the past,

262
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,968
because it took them quite a number of months

263
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:12,068
to get the members and weapons together.

264
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:15,568
Which means their plan was meant to fail to begin with?

265
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,668
They sure are stupid.

266
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,068
But, their guns are for real.

267
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,168
The explosion is probably also.

268
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,768
If we take them lightly,

269
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:29,968
we can't bust in there and nab them, you know.

270
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,468
Bust in there?

271
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:32,868
How?

272
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:35,268
Are you going to shoot them with that gun?

273
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:38,268
No, I'm just going to keep this for them.

274
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,868
I won't shoot.

275
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,968
Well, I guess when we bust in there,

276
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,268
we'll do it outright openly.

277
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:44,568
What...

278
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:47,868
There are still three robbers left, you know.

279
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:49,568
They'll shoot us.

280
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,368
Don't worry.

281
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:52,768
When that time comes,

282
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,068
they won't be able to see us.

283
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,768
That time?

284
00:14:56,768 --> 00:15:01,568
I'm sure that they'll shout the following to the hostages.

285
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,368
Darn! Let's just blow up the entire safe!

286
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,868
Come on and help, you guys!

287
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,568
They're making their move.

288
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,168
Shout?

289
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,768
You mean like now?

290
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,168
Yeah.

291
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:19,068
Ayumi, you keep the door of the elevator open and wait.

292
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,868
Genta, take the cart that is left in front of the elevator

293
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,868
to the counter where the hostages are gathered.

294
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:27,768
Mitsuhiko and I will go there ahead of you.

295
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:28,768
All right.

296
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:29,968
You can count on me.

297
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,268
Listen. Work quickly without making a sound.

298
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:33,568
Quick...

299
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,368
Hey, Conan.

300
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:47,068
Are you sure it's going to work?

301
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:52,768
They're all hostages

302
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:55,368
and none of the robbers are here.

303
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,468
I see.

304
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:58,368
In order to make themselves look like hostages,

305
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:01,168
they have their eyes and mouth covered with masking tape too,

306
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,868
so they can't see us.

307
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:14,568
Here goes.

308
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,568
Just as I thought, a little more than two minutes to go before explosion.

309
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:24,368
That's more than enough time.

310
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:30,168
Hey, Conan, I brought the cart.

311
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,868
Put this on top.

312
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,768
Ayumi, wait outside.

313
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,568
There was a strange sound just now.

314
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,668
Confirm what is was on the double.

315
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,668
-Yes, sir. -Something must've happened.

316
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,068
We somehow made it in time.

317
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:13,068
We were lucky it didn't explode right away.

318
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:15,568
It wasn't luck.

319
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,768
If they're going to fake being hostage,

320
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,368
they'll have to cover their eyes and mouths

321
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:22,368
as well as tie their hands behind them.

322
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:24,168
The guy who yelled a while ago,

323
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:28,568
after doing so, had to use his mouth to tie both his hands,

324
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,168
then go over to where the hostages were.

325
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:33,468
Then after covering his eyes and mouth,

326
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:36,068
had to pull his wrists inside the two arms that are tied

327
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:38,068
and then pull his legs through,

328
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:41,668
so that both his arms would be behind him.

329
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,868
If they hadn't left plenty of time to do that,

330
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,168
they wouldn't be at ease.

331
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:48,368
They figured that three minutes was enough.

332
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,868
But, why did they use a time bomb?

333
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,168
If they used a remote controlled bomb,

334
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:56,368
they could make it explode when they want to.

335
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,468
But they can't throw the controller

336
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:59,568
to a far distance

337
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:02,568
with both hand tied behind them.

338
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,068
I see.

339
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,068
But, how are they going to find the culprits

340
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:13,468
from among these people?

341
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,968
It's easy.

342
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,168
All we got to do is use their voice and say this...

343
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:21,168
Okay! Everybody stand up

344
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:25,368
and slowly walk towards the direction of my voice!

345
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:27,768
Understand? Slowly now!

346
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:30,468
Don't trip over the person in front of you!

347
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:31,968
Hey...

348
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,168
How can you tell...

349
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,068
I was told of this.

350
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:49,568
Was something changed?

351
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:52,568
This must be a mistake.

352
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:55,868
So, you three are the culprits?

353
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,168
The robbers themselves are the only ones who won't move

354
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,868
because something that wasn't planned was voiced.

355
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,668
Okay! First remove the masking tape of the bank man,

356
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:10,168
have him open the door.

357
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:11,368
Yep...

358
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,368
When the riot police come in take these three

359
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:16,568
and the guy that's tied up in the corridor,

360
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:18,268
as well as the guy who's passed out in the restroom...

361
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,568
Just who is passed out?

362
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,568
Conan...

363
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:28,268
That foreign lady and this brat,

364
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,568
what're with them anyway?

365
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,568
Shoots...

366
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,868
I guess the explosion a while ago woke him up.

367
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,968
Hey! You brats over there!

368
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:38,168
If you don't want me to break his neck,

369
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,068
go in the counter and bring the guns over!

370
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,668
I'm besieging this place.

371
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:47,068
I'm taking you to hell with me.

372
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,068
What's this?

373
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,768
You've already got it.

374
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:58,768
I guess you'll have to die.

375
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,768
Who is it? Who fired?

376
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,368
Is it Jodie?

377
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,368
The riot police heard the gun shot

378
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,168
and burst in.

379
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:40,968
The robbers were arrested in no time at all.

380
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:08,868
"Teito Bank" -I'm glad you're all okay.

381
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:11,168
Well, it's just natural outcome.

382
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:14,768
Conan and a FBI agent were there.

383
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,068
No. This time...

384
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,668
It's thanks to the Youth Detective Squad.

385
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:26,768
-Well... -We didn't do that much.

386
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,568
We sure did a lot.

387
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:31,968
It's been bothering me for a while.

388
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:35,268
Jodie, you're an English teacher, aren't you?

389
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:37,768
Since when did you become a FBI agent?

390
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:42,168
That...

391
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:45,368
Don't tell me that you're just acting like you're one?

392
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:49,068
Genta, you pretend to be Kamen Yaiba a lot, don't you?

393
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,768
Right, I'm just pretending.

394
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:54,268
I see!

395
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:55,468
What's the matter?

396
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:57,268
You don't look happy.

397
00:22:57,268 --> 00:23:00,268
I was just wondering

398
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:02,468
who shot at the culprit towards the end.

399
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:06,568
Jodie was passed out.

400
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:09,068
Was there anybody there

401
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,468
who could shoot in the condition he was in?

402
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,468
Shu?

403
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:17,868
Didn't you see him?

404
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:19,568
He was among the hostages, wasn't he?

405
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,368
You had it tough, didn't you, Jodie?

406
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,968
We were at that liquor store till a while ago,

407
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:29,768
so we weren't aware of anything.

408
00:23:29,768 --> 00:23:32,868
And? Who was there?

409
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:35,868
Well...

410
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,868
Shuichi Akai died, you know!

411
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:41,068
Don't ever say that name again!

412
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,768
Is anything the matter?

413
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,368
No, it's nothing.

414
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:51,768
Just forget what I said.

415
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:08,168
"Next Episode"

416
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:09,468
What the...

417
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:13,668
Did anyone come out from here?

418
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,968
Nobody came out!

419
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,568
You mean there was murder right behind me?

420
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:19,768
How dare to make light of me!

421
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:23,168
Poison seems to have been put on the tip of the arrow.

422
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:25,868
I saw that person a while ago!

423
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:28,368
I've figured it out,

424
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:31,468
that person's the culprit!

425
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,068
Next Conan,

426
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:35,933
"The Witness Who Didn't See"

427
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:51,895
One, two!

428
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:53,995
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:55,895
"Wig"

430
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,995
The title of the next episode is a bit strange.

431
00:24:57,995 --> 00:24:59,995
You've gotta watch.
