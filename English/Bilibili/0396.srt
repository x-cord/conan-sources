1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,640
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,340
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,140
The treasure of the Gods is finally found!

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,740
Did Thief Kid get it or did the Youth Detective Squad get it?

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:59,725
We came along to camp together with Dr. Agasa.

9
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:01,525
Genta and the others find a mysterious looking stone

10
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:04,625
near a suspicious looking mansion.

11
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,025
There are codes concerning the Big Jewel there.

12
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,825
And besides it,

13
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,125
we find a body of a man who had been strangled to death.

14
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,225
We then enter the mysterious looking mansion of tricks

15
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,825
where we encounter two treasure hunters

16
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,925
and an queer old woman.

17
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:26,125
I guess we'll have to find the other sacred treasure

18
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,425
to solve the mystery.

19
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,025
The other?

20
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,525
They're called the three sacred treasures.

21
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:35,725
The mirror and the comma-shaped bead were found,

22
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:37,925
so there should be one more somewhere.

23
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,925
The three sacred treasures?

24
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,825
Yes. The mirror is the Mirror of Yata,

25
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:45,925
the comma-shaped bead is called the Magatama of Yasakani.

26
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,725
And the remaining one

27
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,625
is the sword of the Gods.

28
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,925
It got its name because it is said to have saved God Takeru Yamato,

29
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,825
who was in a pinch

30
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:58,125
by slashing down the grass when fire was set to the field.

31
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,825
The Sword of Kusanagi.

32
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:07,825
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Case Closed"

33
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,225
I know about that Sword of Kusanagi!

34
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,325
It's the fantastic sword that comes out a lot in games, right?

35
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,025
The Sword of Kusanagi?

36
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,825
If we look at the writings on that sword,

37
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,625
we may be able to figure something out.

38
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,625
Before searching for the treasure,

39
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:30,325
I think our priority is to get out of this basement cell.

40
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,225
If it is about getting out of here,

41
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,625
he should know it.

42
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,725
Unless you already came here once and read the writings on the gravestone,

43
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:45,925
you wouldn't be hiding that stone mirror that you have on you.

44
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,125
Yes, yes.

45
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,725
Let me show you the way.

46
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,525
What a large house.

47
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,825
The basement is strangely large.

48
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,925
The floor's starting to get wet.

49
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:01,925
Yes.

50
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,625
Water is flowing in from somewhere.

51
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,525
There! Over there.

52
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,825
What's that trace that looks as if something had moved out of place.

53
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:15,525
Now that you mentioned it, there was an earthquake a little while ago.

54
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:18,925
That's why the house moved a bit, and water from below flowed out.

55
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,025
Just as Kichiemon says,

56
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:26,125
maybe God Nioh is angry.

57
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:30,125
Telling us to quit treasure hunting and quickly go back home.

58
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:38,525
Hey, the notebook that the man who was found in the swamp,

59
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,925
it's dry now and are readable.

60
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:45,325
It seems that he was killed by his partner.

61
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,725
"I've teamed up with a dangerous guy.

62
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:51,125
I've got to hide this stone I found, or he'll kill me.

63
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,125
Poison rat says he's going to kill me

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,125
and take the treasure all for himself."

65
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,825
After that, it's ripped so I can't read on.

66
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,925
Amazing!

67
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,325
Amazing!

68
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:15,625
Is this smoke comes from a hot spring or something?

69
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,625
Yes.

70
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,325
Kichiemon probably dug it up.

71
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,325
To hide this entrance with steam.

72
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,425
-I see. -Fantastic!

73
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,125
What a red hot spring.

74
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,525
I wonder if it contains a lot of iron?

75
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,825
Hey, brat!

76
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,825
That's not the exit.

77
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,025
Brat!

78
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,825
Conan, what's up?

79
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:45,425
Are you all right?

80
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,425
Hey, do you know?

81
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:50,025
Do you know where the Sword of Kusanagi came out from?

82
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,425
What?

83
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:56,325
I'm sure you've all heard about the story of Susano,

84
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:57,925
the kid brother of Oomikami Ametarasu,

85
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,925
making a monster drink sake to get it drunk

86
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:03,525
and eventually defeat it in order to rescue Princess Kushinada.

87
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:06,125
And the sword that came out of the tail of the monster

88
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,125
was the Sword of Ameno Murakumo,

89
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,425
which later became known as the Sword of Kusanagi.

90
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:13,425
Don't tell me that monster

91
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:15,125
is the one that often comes out in stories of long ago.

92
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,225
Yes.

93
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:18,625
Its eye are flaming red like those of an ogre

94
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,225
and its stomach is inflamed with blood.

95
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,225
Although it has just one body,

96
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:25,825
it is the legendary eight-headed dragon with eight heads and eight tails.

97
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,625
Look at the basin of this waterfall.

98
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,025
Doesn't it look very similar...

99
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,925
to the eight-headed dragon?

100
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:38,925
I see.

101
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:43,425
The waterfall is the dragon's neck and the branches its tails.

102
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:46,725
Which means that the sword is in one of the branches?

103
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:51,125
Yes. According to the legend, the sword came out of the tail in the middle.

104
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,525
In other words, the Sword of Kusanagi should be up ahead of this branch.

105
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:58,025
Don't tell me you plan to dive through the hot water?

106
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,925
Forget it! There's nothing there.

107
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:04,025
What if it's the bottom of the valley up ahead?

108
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,825
But we came this far, so I want to see what there is up ahead.

109
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,725
Something is rising.

110
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,325
The water level is decreasing.

111
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,225
Now, we can go through the hole!

112
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:31,625
All right!

113
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,625
Okay! Let's go.

114
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,725
Hold it, Genta!

115
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,225
Out of my way!

116
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,725
Hey, Granny!

117
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:41,825
Darn it!

118
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:57,725
That is indeed the Sword of Kusanagi!

119
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:13,325
So you were after the treasure, too.

120
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,825
What a dangerous trap.

121
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:20,625
When you try to get close to the sword,

122
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,325
weight bears down on the floor and blades come flying from all directions.

123
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,525
I guess he doesn't want it to be taken, does he?

124
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,925
No, it's not just an ordinary mean trap.

125
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,225
Blades come from all directions.

126
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,225
Conan!

127
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:38,225
And the blades settling in all four directions

128
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,525
only goes to show that the timing is slightly synchronized

129
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,325
so that they won't bump into each other.

130
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:44,725
Moreover...

131
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,725
the fact that there is a handle like this on the blade,

132
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:54,925
is telling you to use it to go over to the sword!

133
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,625
He got to the other side!

134
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,025
Conan is amazing!

135
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,525
-What's written on it? -What's written on the sword?

136
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:17,925
Dragon.

137
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,025
-Dragon? -Dragon?

138
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:24,025
Forever, flames and dragon.

139
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,925
Just as expected of Kichiemon!

140
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:31,425
It probably means, suffer in agony forever

141
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:35,025
as if being burned by the flames of the dragon.

142
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:38,625
So let's forget about treasure hunting and go home.

143
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,625
Maybe there was no treasure to begin with anyway.

144
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,825
What's with you?

145
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,425
You were going all out to get it just a while ago.

146
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:51,925
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

147
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,225
Forever.

148
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:55,625
Flames.

149
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,925
Dragon.

150
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,825
"Offer me..."

151
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,525
"To me!"

152
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,325
Hey, Conan!

153
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:06,525
Conan!

154
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,825
Can you still come back here?

155
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,225
Oh, my.

156
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:35,025
You look satisfied. So, you've figured something out?

157
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,325
Really, Conan?

158
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,825
No.

159
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,825
This look on my face is a wretched look that says,

160
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,225
"Let's hurry up and head on home."

161
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:44,825
Are you serious?

162
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,525
Hey, Conan.

163
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,725
Are you serious about heading home?

164
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:53,725
After we found the mysterious three sacred treasures?

165
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:56,025
You're going to forget about the diamond?

166
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,925
The words that are carved on the sacred treasures,

167
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,625
flames, forever and dragon, as far as the meaning is concerned

168
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,925
and as to the meaning of the writings in the stone lantern,

169
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:09,125
I don't have the slightest idea.

170
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,525
I guess I'll get going then.

171
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:17,025
I guess I'll check this mansion a bit more, too.

172
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:22,125
We finally made it outside.

173
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,925
It seems Dr. Agasa hasn't come back yet.

174
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,225
Doctor?

175
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:30,725
Dr. Agasa is suppose to bring some police officers here.

176
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:36,225
I guess you'll be able to get out of these mountains even without me.

177
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:39,025
If you don't want God Nioh to curse you,

178
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,825
don't dilly-dally and head on home right away.

179
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:47,625
Now that all the people you don't want around have left,

180
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,525
lead the way, will you?

181
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,825
To where the treasure is.

182
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,125
Come on, Conan.

183
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,547
Then, you...

184
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:07,147
You figured out the code!

185
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:10,247
It was written on the gravestone in the basement, right?

186
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:14,147
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

187
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:17,547
The "me" here refers to Kichiemon Samizu.

188
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:20,047
In other words, it's telling you to add the kanji character "Mizu"

189
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,847
to the characters of the sacred treasures.

190
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:23,547
The words that were found on the three sacred treasures

191
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:24,747
were "Hono" for flames...

192
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:26,347
And "El" for forever.

193
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,447
And "Ryu" for dragon!

194
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,447
What happens when you put "Sanzui" alongside it?

195
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,947
The character "Hono" for flames becomes "Awa" as in Awaji Island!

196
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:40,147
The character "El" becomes "ei", the character for the word swimming!

197
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,747
The character "Ryu" becomes "taki", the character for waterfall.

198
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,947
Does it mean to go swimming in the waterfall of Awaji Island?

199
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:53,747
It said on the gravestone in the basement "Lost ones", right?

200
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,747
That was a hint for those who couldn't figure out

201
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,947
the code of the stone lanterns.

202
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,147
The writing on the lantern said,

203
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,747
a place nearest to the sun,

204
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,947
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

205
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:07,247
When you put this together with the three characters,

206
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:09,047
the place nearest to the sun is Mercury,

207
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,547
the first planet in the solar system.

208
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:14,747
The elders refer to the carps with whiskers.

209
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:18,547
The busy place means a place where the sound of the water never stops.

210
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:26,047
In other words, the stone of the God Nioh, the diamond

211
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,847
is hidden near the waterfall where a lot of carps swim in fresh water!

212
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,247
Amazing, Conan!

213
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:30,647
It's the waterfall in the basement!

214
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,947
It's where the eight-headed dragon is.

215
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:36,347
Too bad. That's a hot spring and not fresh water.

216
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:40,847
Maybe it's the river that was in the house?

217
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:43,447
There were lots of carps swimming inside, too.

218
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,047
But there was no waterfall.

219
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:47,947
Oh, that's right.

220
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,347
Listen carefully.

221
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:52,847
You hear it, don't you?

222
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,547
It's leading us to where the treasure is.

223
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,147
That sound.

224
00:13:58,647 --> 00:13:59,847
I see!

225
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:01,947
It's at the first swamp that we saw.

226
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:03,147
Let's go!

227
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,347
Okay!

228
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,747
Hey.

229
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,647
That body is gone.

230
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:12,747
Yes.

231
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:17,047
The killer hid it again after we entered the house.

232
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:18,247
What're you talking about?

233
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:20,547
About a body.

234
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,147
Do you see anything?

235
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:29,547
Well, it's dark and I can't tell unless I dive in there or something.

236
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:31,347
Too bad.

237
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:38,047
He seems to have gotten there before you.

238
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,647
Sarina.

239
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,647
Just when did she get here?

240
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,047
Look behind the waterfall.

241
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:45,947
Behind the waterfall?

242
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:48,447
There is a card or something up there.

243
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:52,147
"Thanks for the stone of the God Nioh."

244
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:54,147
Thief Kid?

245
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,547
-Oh, no. -No joke!

246
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,147
Seriously?

247
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:02,547
He is indeed the great thief under the heavens.

248
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:05,847
Well, if the stone was taken by the great thief that deceives the world,

249
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:09,547
I guess puppet maker Kichiemon couldn't have asked for more.

250
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:14,047
Granny, I thought you went home.

251
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:17,547
What's up?

252
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:18,947
Mitsuhiko!

253
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:35,847
Are you all right?

254
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,347
Let's pull out of here!

255
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:39,747
There seems to be nothing here.

256
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:44,447
I found something!

257
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,847
It was hidden in the mud,

258
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,947
but there was definitely a stone that was shining

259
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,347
at the bottom of the swamp.

260
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:57,947
It's mine!

261
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,347
Hey! Don't take it!

262
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:04,047
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

263
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,747
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

264
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,547
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

265
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:13,347
Proverb of long ago...

266
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,847
Don't move!

267
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,447
Who would've thought it was hidden with mud?

268
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:25,447
I didn't search that well and was about to overlook it,

269
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:28,447
thanks to that card.

270
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:33,447
Go on, line up on that side!

271
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:37,347
When that man comes out from the water holding the treasure,

272
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,947
I'll give you all a good dunk in the water together.

273
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,547
You've finally shown your true identity.

274
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,847
Thief Kid!

275
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,947
She is?

276
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:49,547
I'm the Thief Kid?

277
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:50,947
Don't be silly, I'm...

278
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:53,847
You're the poison rat that killed your partner

279
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,947
in order to hog the treasure all for yourself, right?

280
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:03,647
When that guy showed the stone mirror, you said...

281
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:08,047
Which means that the one that you kids found

282
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,147
had something like flames carved on it?

283
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,347
Isn't that right?

284
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,847
Back then, all I said was I found a stone sacred treasure.

285
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:19,547
So how did you know

286
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,247
that what we found was not the sword, but the comma-shaped bead?

287
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,047
You knew because you're the one who tore off the page from the notebook

288
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:27,947
of the man that you sunk to the bottom of the swamp.

289
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,147
You took the diagram that showed that the character flames

290
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:33,047
was written inside the comma-shaped bead.

291
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:36,447
How did you find out what was written?

292
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:41,547
The notes were written in pencil,

293
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:44,547
so you could see slight traces on the paper.

294
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:48,747
So you're a bit smart.

295
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,447
But also careless, kid.

296
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:53,147
You come close to the gun barrel from your side.

297
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:55,247
Right. I had to do this...

298
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:09,447
or else that anesthetic needle won't hit you directly.

299
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,347
But that was suprising.

300
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:18,547
That woman is Thief Kid.

301
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,247
No. Thief Kid is...

302
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,347
I've got the stone of the God Nioh!

303
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:26,947
No!

304
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,847
Hurry and put the diamond back where it was!

305
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:51,847
What?

306
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,547
Otherwise you'll drift down to the bottom of the valley

307
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,747
together with the water!

308
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,247
There it is.

309
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:05,947
It's that mansion!

310
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:29,547
That diamond was the switch to this huge trap.

311
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:34,347
He had no intention of letting anybody have the treasure to begin with.

312
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:39,347
Yes. Diamonds, because of their impenetrable hardness,

313
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:42,447
once used to be called adamas from which the word adamant,

314
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,847
meaning utterly unyielding was derived.

315
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:45,847
Therefore, learn from the proverb of long ago

316
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,947
means the treasure shall never be taken.

317
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:50,347
Well, when the Shogunate collapsed,

318
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:53,047
not wanting the ones who overthrew the government to confiscate his assets,

319
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:57,047
it's most likely that Kichiemon thought this up.

320
00:19:57,047 --> 00:20:01,547
That's why you stole it once but decided against it. Right, granny?

321
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:04,647
Or rather, the greatest thief under the heavens.

322
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:17,847
There he is!

323
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:19,947
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

324
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:23,047
Exactly. Good work.

325
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,647
The wall of the mansion that was slightly raised, and the basement passage

326
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:28,247
that was slightly out of place where the water came gushing out.

327
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:31,247
Contrary to what was written on the card, the jewel was not taken.

328
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:35,847
And shouting, "Don't take it!" all points

329
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:39,847
to none other than the fact that granny is Thief Kid.

330
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,747
Bingo!

331
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:46,847
Well, I didn't take it also because it was not what I was after.

332
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:50,947
That's why you said, "Let's forget about the treasure hunt and go home."

333
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:55,747
But you knocked me down and tried to take the sword.

334
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:58,847
That was to rescue you, Genta.

335
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:01,247
If he didn't go in before you and make you realize there was a trap there,

336
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,947
you would've been slashed to pieces.

337
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:09,647
So he waited for us in the basement

338
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,047
so that we wouldn't get caught by the traps?

339
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:12,247
My, my.

340
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:15,347
What a heart-warming and touching thief we have.

341
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:18,547
I'm truly honored by your words, little lady.

342
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:23,947
Well, I'll let you go for today since you rescued my friends from danger.

343
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:27,747
But I'll expose you to the light of day for sure someday,

344
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:28,947
so don't forget that.

345
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:36,647
I'll peel off that cape of yours as well as make you show yourself.

346
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,947
I advise you not to.

347
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:44,047
Pandora opened the box because she didn't know what was inside.

348
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,947
Knowing the contents before opening the treasure box...

349
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,547
is no fun.

350
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:00,747
You idiot.

351
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:03,047
It's the work of a detective

352
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:05,147
to find out what's inside before opening the box.

353
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,347
So, what now?

354
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,847
That's right.

355
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:40,447
Since the jewel was returned, it seems the water is receding.

356
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:43,747
I guess we have no choice but to wait for help to come.

357
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:45,347
What happened to Dr. Agasa?

358
