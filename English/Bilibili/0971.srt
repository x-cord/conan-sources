00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.530
Aiko...

2
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.990
Aiko...

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.760
From: Aiko
Subject:
Goodbye

4
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.880
Damn!

5
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.580
This is their fault!

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.890
Their fault!

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.930
Their fault!

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.310
Their fault!

9
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.830
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

10
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.730
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

11
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.190
While love blossoms at the
MPD, black malice approaches!

12
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.870
Always determining the one truth

13
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.700
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

14
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.020
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:00.551
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part One)

16
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.901
"Target: MPD Transportation
Department, Part One!"
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part One)

17
00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:05.981
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part One)

18
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.731
I'm late!

19
00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.611
This isn't good! Yumi-san's going to be mad!

20
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.661
I'm sorry!

21
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:19.581
Huh? You...

22
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:22.331
What? No way! Chiba-kun?

23
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:24.491
Are you...?

24
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.911
Y-Yes?

25
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:27.861
Are you...?

26
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:29.091
Yes?

27
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.541
Are you maybe...?

28
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:32.501
Yes?

29
00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:44.351
Oh, no!

30
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:44.601
Miike

31
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:45.571
I'm actually late!
Miike

32
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:46.361
See you later!
Miike

33
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:46.991
See you later!

34
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.501
The light's always so long
when you're in a hurry.

35
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:54.361
I can't be late.

36
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.361
No one's looking.

37
00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:59.831
There aren't any cars. Maybe I'll cross.

38
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.491
The light is red!

39
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:07.371
Who cares? There isn't a single car.

40
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:09.671
No one's watching.

41
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.051
I'm watching.

42
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.171
And you're watching, too.

43
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:18.011
Once you go easy on yourself and
break the rules, it becomes a habit.

44
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.011
Habits are hard to break even if you want to.

45
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.771
Do you not even understand that?

46
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:36.831
No, no. Be patient.

47
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:42.271
Hey, you're the mini patrolwoman's henchman.

48
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.791
It's Naeko-san.

49
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:45.201
Henchman?

50
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.421
You're up early.

51
00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:51.611
We're up early because it's
our turn to feed the rabbits.

52
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:54.551
Is something happening?

53
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:58.601
It's traffic month at the MPD.
We're tightening supervision.

54
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.241
All right.

55
00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:01.841
Don't! The light's still red.

56
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:04.601
But there aren't any cars.

57
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:08.181
Doesn't this symbol mean kids can cross?

58
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:12.531
No, this sign is a warning
to drivers to be careful

59
00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:17.401
because there's a school, kindergarten,
or nursery school nearby.

60
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:21.951
Most road signs are divided
by color and function.

61
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:25.951
Yellow signs like this one are warnings.

62
00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:28.581
Red means danger or prohibition.

63
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:32.351
Easy-to-read blue signs are for directions.

64
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:38.211
Calming green signs that are easy on the
eyes are used to guide people to emergency exits.

65
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:43.331
Think of it as the same as a traffic
light's red, yellow, and green.

66
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:44.771
Huh.

67
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.351
You certainly are a female officer
of the traffic department.

68
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:51.471
The shapes have meaning, too.

69
00:05:51.471 --> 00:05:55.631
Circles that appear larger than they
are for prohibitions or regulations.

70
00:05:55.631 --> 00:06:01.251
Triangles or squares with points at the
top look unstable and draw your attention,

71
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.111
so they're for warnings and regulations.

72
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:08.371
Solid stable-looking squares
are for direction and guidance.

73
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.871
I'm sure you'll learn
about it at school soon.

74
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:16.441
Make sure you follow traffic rules.

75
00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:17.921
Okay!

76
00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:19.841
Follow the rules! Follow the rules!

77
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:20.921
The rules...
Follow the rules! Follow the rules!

78
00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:22.861
Follow the rules! Follow the rules!

79
00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:23.931
The rules...
Follow the rules! Follow the rules!

80
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:24.951
Everyone should follow
them! Follow the rules!

81
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.051
The rules!
Everyone should follow
them! Follow the rules!

82
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:32.811
What? You got hit on again?

83
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:34.691
During a stakeout?

84
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:36.431
Yeah.

85
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:42.341
Apparently the clothes I always borrow
from your friend make me look easy.

86
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:44.591
You're right.

87
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:50.701
The clothes you wear to stakeouts always
have a kind of devilish aura about them.

88
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:55.461
Well, as long as I don't
look like a cop, it's okay.

89
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.521
So, what'd you do with
the guy who hit on you?

90
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:02.471
Naturally, I drove him off by
secretly showing him my badge.

91
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:06.721
I told him, "Don't you think you're
hitting on the wrong woman?"

92
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.971
But weren't you on a stakeout
with Takagi-san at the time?

93
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:11.781
Yeah.

94
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:18.141
Then couldn't you have chased them
off by saying he's your boyfriend?

95
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.651
Oh, well...

96
00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:22.031
You're not wrong,

97
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:27.281
but I once actually did that
to tease Takagi-kun, and...

98
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:30.771
Oh, uh, it's not that I'm her boyfriend,

99
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:34.791
but we're actually here on a stakeout...

100
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.671
He panicked, and everyone in the
area figured out that we were cops.

101
00:07:40.201 --> 00:07:42.561
So we can't use that strategy.

102
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:44.641
Oh, Takagi-san.

103
00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:45.961
I know.

104
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:49.681
Takagi-kun's always so fun to tease.

105
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.211
Speak of the devil.

106
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:53.431
Sato-san!

107
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:56.671
What are you doing here?

108
00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:58.811
Inspector Megure was looking for you.

109
00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:00.091
He's having you stakeout another location
today, so he asked you to check out the location.

110
00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:01.821
Ch-Chiba-kun!
He's having you stakeout another location
today, so he asked you to check out the location.

111
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.241
He's having you stakeout another location
today, so he asked you to check out the location.

112
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:09.121
Oh, no! I had pot stickers for lunch
today, so my breath might stink!

113
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:14.781
By the way, is the newbie who went out
on the stakeout with you feeling better?

114
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.501
No, his allergies have
gotten worse since then.

115
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:19.881
He's at home asleep today.

116
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:23.151
Well, I can conduct a stakeout on my own.

117
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:28.431
If you're short a man, how about her?

118
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:37.771
Y-You...

119
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:39.771
Y-Yes?

120
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:42.561
You wouldn't be good on a stakeout.

121
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:46.011
You'd just look like a middle schooler
being admonished by an officer.

122
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:49.531
A middle schooler? But we're the same age.

123
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.691
Chiba, what are you doing?

124
00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:52.681
Let's go.

125
00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:53.791
Coming.

126
00:08:57.731 --> 00:08:59.431
Chiba-kun...

127
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:00.501
Jeez.

128
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:07.781
Miwako proudly declares her love,
but you're absolutely hopeless.

129
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:09.621
Yeah, but...

130
00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:11.641
Feel like singing, Miike?

131
00:09:11.931 --> 00:09:12.091

I'll sing! Let me sing with you!

134
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:21.321
All right. Toko, will you come with us?

135

Yumi, how about you?

139
00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:31.091
I'll pass. I've got stuff to do tonight.

140
00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:33.151
Is it your shogi master boyfriend again?

141
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:35.451
Yeah, something like that.

142
00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:38.231
They added the new Eio title,

143
00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:44.451
so I have to talk Chukichi into getting
it so he can be a septuple crown master.

144
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:46.461

147

For now I don't really want
to think about the future

148
00:10:04.661 --> 00:10:10.591
No one can be greater than you

149
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:12.241

Hey, Shiori.

Anything strange?
Isn't real anymore?

157
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:21.011
Like being followed by someone.
Isn't real anymore?

158
00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:22.721
The clear tears that fall
Like being followed by someone.

159
00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:24.131
Come to think of it, since about a week ago.
The clear tears that fall

160
00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:25.581
Aren't visible to anyone's eyes
Come to think of it, since about a week ago.

161
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.441
Seriously? You, too?
Aren't visible to anyone's eyes

162
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:27.961
I scream at the sky, but there's no answer
Seriously? You, too?

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.281
I scream at the sky, but there's no answer

But we'll be fine. We're strong.
I scream at the sky, but there's no answer

its knees behind its words
But we'll be fine. We're strong.

166
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:34.271
I'll search for the voice holding
its knees behind its words

167
00:10:34.271 --> 00:10:37.381
Besides, you're a third dan judoka.
I'll search for the voice holding
its knees behind its words

168
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:37.411
Well, yeah.
I'll search for the voice holding
its knees behind its words

169
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:38.971
And I'll go running to you now
Well, yeah.

170
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.981
And I'll go running to you now

171
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.731
Are you okay? Can you handle her?

172
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.281
I'll be fine.

173
00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:55.161
Chiba-kun... You big dummy...

174
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:02.661
Hey, Miike. Miike!

175
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.601
Come on, Miike.

176
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:07.521
Can you walk home? Can you make it?

177
00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:10.051
I'm totally fine!

178
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.271
Excuse me.

179
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:25.651
I've been hearing the sound of a small girl
crying in the park bathroom for a while.

180
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:28.061
Could you go check it out?

181
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:31.401
I wanted to ask the police,

182
00:11:31.931 --> 00:11:34.071
but there isn't a police
box in the neighborhood.

183
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:36.901
Got it.

184
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:39.271
Could you take me to that park?

185
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:43.081
Beika Higashi Park

186
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:46.381
I don't hear anything.

187
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:50.091
It was coming from the women's
bathroom in the back.

188
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:53.091
Hello?

189
00:11:54.561 --> 00:11:56.691
Is someone there?

190
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:09.161
I knew it. I'd sensed an
odd presence recently.

191
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:12.591
I'm a cop.

192
00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:16.361
Looks like you chose the
wrong target for your trap.

193
00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:30.781
I didn't choose wrong.

194
00:12:33.631 --> 00:12:36.471
I didn't choose the wrong target!

195
00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:02.118
Hey, kids.

196
00:13:02.118 --> 00:13:03.728
Yumi-san!

197
00:13:03.728 --> 00:13:07.758
You're such good kids to raise your
hands while you walk in the crosswalk.

198
00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:11.738
Naeko-san told us about
traffic rules yesterday.

199
00:13:11.738 --> 00:13:14.288
So we did a bunch of research.

200
00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:18.268
Kids are hard to see because they're
small, so they raise their hands, right?

201
00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:21.768
Really? Miike, huh?

202
00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:26.728
Japanese road signs are based
off of English ones, right?

203
00:13:26.728 --> 00:13:27.518
What?

204
00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.678
Is that right? Miike, did you know that?

205
00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:33.528
Yes. That's what I learned.

206
00:13:33.808 --> 00:13:37.438
Anyway, you guys are working early.

207
00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:39.658
It's traffic month, right?

208
00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:41.658
Yeah, something like that.

209
00:13:41.658 --> 00:13:44.998
We're looking out for your safety.

210
00:13:44.998 --> 00:13:47.388
Thank you for your service, boss!

211
00:13:47.388 --> 00:13:49.618
This is nothing!

212
00:13:51.418 --> 00:13:52.138
I'm the boss!

213
00:13:52.138 --> 00:13:55.018
Hey, we should get going.

214
00:13:55.508 --> 00:13:57.018
MPD to all stations.

215
00:13:57.298 --> 00:14:03.118
The body of a woman bludgeoned to death
was discovered at Beika Higashi Park.

216
00:14:03.118 --> 00:14:05.708
All patrols in the neighborhood,
please head to the location.

217
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:06.548
No way. That's nearby.
All patrols in the neighborhood,
please head to the location.

218
00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:07.818
No way. That's nearby.

219
00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:11.478
Let's head there to preserve the crime scene.

220
00:14:11.478 --> 00:14:14.698
Right, like controlling curious onlookers.

221
00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:18.048
Don't be late, kids.

222
00:14:20.218 --> 00:14:21.938
It's at Higashi Park.

223
00:14:21.938 --> 00:14:25.798
We still have time before
first period, right?

224
00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.338
Should we go, too?

225
00:14:27.338 --> 00:14:28.628
Let's go.

226
00:14:28.828 --> 00:14:30.378
Hey, guys!

227
00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:35.878
Man, you're hopeless.

228
00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:38.088
We're just going to check it out, okay?

229
00:14:38.088 --> 00:14:40.388
Yeah!

230
00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:44.508
You're the one who wants
to go the most, Kudo-kun.

231
00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:45.678
It's obvious.

232
00:14:52.498 --> 00:14:53.598
Sato-san!

233
00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.248
It's no use.

234
00:14:55.248 --> 00:15:00.658
We didn't find anything in the area
that would help us identify the victim.

235
00:15:01.048 --> 00:15:03.118
Maybe the suspect took it.

236
00:15:03.118 --> 00:15:07.688
Does that mean this was a robbery?

237
00:15:08.768 --> 00:15:10.598
N-No!

238
00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:14.668
M-Momosaki-san! Momosaki-san!

239
00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:17.268
Momosaki-san...

240
00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.248
You knew her?

241
00:15:20.248 --> 00:15:21.448
She's a colleague.

242
00:15:22.058 --> 00:15:24.318
I thought I recognized her.

243
00:15:24.318 --> 00:15:25.978
So she was a cop.

244
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.058
Momosaki Toko.

245
00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:33.978
Like us, she worked for the MPD
Transportation Department as a sergeant.

246
00:15:34.498 --> 00:15:37.758
But she was a third dan judoka.
How could this happen?

247
00:15:38.918 --> 00:15:43.658
Come to think of it, weren't you going to
karaoke with Momosaki and Yagi last night?

248
00:15:44.858 --> 00:15:46.088
Miike!

249
00:15:46.088 --> 00:15:50.148
Yes, but I got drunk.

250
00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:56.008
I only remember Yagi-san, who
went with us, walking me home.

251
00:15:56.568 --> 00:15:58.388
Where was the karaoke box?

252
00:15:58.998 --> 00:16:05.298
Karaoke Beika on fourth street, across from
the planetarium that's being remodeled.

253
00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.268
That's right over there.

254
00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:13.758
Then maybe she was attacked while
trying to use the park bathroom.

255
00:16:13.758 --> 00:16:19.268
But if the suspect bludgeoned
a third dan judoka to death,

256
00:16:19.268 --> 00:16:23.578
it's possible they're quite strong as well.

257
00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:30.798
Or they knew she was a cop
and planned a countermeasure.

258
00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:31.578
What?

259
00:16:32.038 --> 00:16:35.548
This bent 100 yen coin next to the body...

260
00:16:36.048 --> 00:16:40.968
What if it wasn't a coincidence, and
the suspect left it there deliberately?

261
00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:45.098
So it was a premeditated crime.

262
00:16:45.098 --> 00:16:48.588
Maybe it was the work of someone
who bore some financial resentment.

263
00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:52.828
We'll have to canvas the
area to gather information,

264
00:16:53.298 --> 00:16:57.648
but for now, our only clue
is this 100 yen coin.

265
00:16:57.888 --> 00:16:58.648
No...

266
00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:01.818
There are other clues, too.

267
00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.528
Conan-kun?

268
00:17:03.528 --> 00:17:06.058
Look at her left hand.

269
00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.508
There's nothing on her pointer finger,

270
00:17:08.508 --> 00:17:13.538
but there's a scrape along the first joint
of her middle, ring, and pinkie fingers.

271
00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:14.678
And...

272
00:17:14.678 --> 00:17:15.838
Hey, wait.

273
00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:20.718
If you flip it over, there's a scrape
along the bottom of her palm, too.

274
00:17:21.638 --> 00:17:25.098
But there aren't any signs
that her body was dragged.

275
00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:30.228
Which means her left hand was
actually shaped like this

276
00:17:30.478 --> 00:17:32.848
and placed against the ground like this.

277
00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.158
What you doing?

278
00:17:41.448 --> 00:17:43.908
She probably got these scrapes

279
00:17:43.908 --> 00:17:48.788
when someone kicked it towards her feet.

280
00:17:49.098 --> 00:17:53.338
So she was trying to tell us
something by pointing somewhere?

281
00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.748
At what, though?

282
00:17:55.378 --> 00:17:58.268
Look at the tip of her pointer finger.

283
00:17:59.058 --> 00:18:01.158
See the little bit of blood on it?

284
00:18:01.668 --> 00:18:02.798
You're right.

285
00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:08.258
Maybe that means she knew the
culprit would move her hand

286
00:18:08.258 --> 00:18:11.278
no matter what she pointed at,

287
00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:15.058
so she used her own blood
to leave a fingerprint.

288
00:18:18.418 --> 00:18:19.368
Look!

289
00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:24.548
There's a stain from where her
bloody finger scraped against it.

290
00:18:24.548 --> 00:18:28.998
In other words, she was actually
pointing in that direction.

291
00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:33.198
A swing set?

292
00:18:33.198 --> 00:18:34.208
Yeah.

293
00:18:34.658 --> 00:18:35.848
What does that mean?

294
00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.178
What? Uh...

295
00:18:42.758 --> 00:18:43.718
Yumi.

296
00:18:43.908 --> 00:18:48.138
Who else was with the victim
at the karaoke box last night?

297
00:18:48.568 --> 00:18:53.228
Lieutenant Yagi Shiori also of the
Transportation Department was with them.

298
00:18:53.228 --> 00:18:54.438
Right?

299
00:18:54.438 --> 00:18:55.618
Yes.

300
00:18:55.618 --> 00:18:57.208
Where is she now?

301
00:18:57.208 --> 00:18:59.328
Yagi's got the day off.

302
00:18:59.328 --> 00:19:02.648
Since it's still early,
she's probably at home.

303
00:19:02.918 --> 00:19:04.508
I see. Got it.

304
00:19:05.008 --> 00:19:08.458
Someone go to Lieutenant
Yagi's place immediately.

305
00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:09.338
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:19:09.338 --> 00:19:10.908
Oh, uh...

307
00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:15.328
By the way, what are you kids doing here?

308
00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:19.438
We ran into Yumi-san and Naeko-san in their
mini patrol car while on our way to school.

309
00:19:19.438 --> 00:19:22.088
We heard about the case on the radio.

310
00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:25.228
How did you get here?

311
00:19:25.228 --> 00:19:27.968
We came immediately when we heard the radio,

312
00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:30.408
but you were already
investigating the crime scene.

313
00:19:30.408 --> 00:19:34.738
Sato-san and I happened to be
conducting a stakeout in the area.

314
00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:37.058
We'd just finished when we got the call.

315
00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:42.568
So you were with Detective
Sato all night last night.

316
00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.718
We were working, okay?

317
00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:46.318
I know...

318
00:19:53.228 --> 00:19:54.828
Yeah, that's right.

319
00:19:54.828 --> 00:19:58.458
Last night, Toko, Miike,
and I went to karaoke.

320
00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:04.948
I said I'd walk Miike home since she was drunk
and parted ways with Toko in front of the store.

321
00:20:05.468 --> 00:20:08.718
I had no idea this would happen afterwards.

322
00:20:09.078 --> 00:20:12.688
It looked like she was trying
to stop by the park bathroom.

323
00:20:12.688 --> 00:20:13.938
That's odd.

324
00:20:13.938 --> 00:20:18.438
Toko used the bathroom just
before we left the karaoke box.

325
00:20:18.728 --> 00:20:21.228
Then what was she doing in a park?

326
00:20:21.538 --> 00:20:25.858
Was there anyone who resented her?

327
00:20:26.228 --> 00:20:31.468
Last night she said she felt like she was
being followed starting about a week ago.

328
00:20:31.468 --> 00:20:32.308
And?

329
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:36.368
But that was the only time we discussed it.

330
00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:37.628
I see.

331
00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:42.078
Do you know anything about a swing set?

332
00:20:42.078 --> 00:20:43.268
A swing set?

333
00:20:45.728 --> 00:20:50.758
She pointed at that swing
set just before she died.

334
00:20:56.518 --> 00:20:58.928
What? Did you remember something?

335
00:21:04.568 --> 00:21:05.408
I don't know.

336
00:21:05.408 --> 00:21:09.438
I could be wrong, so I'll
call you once I'm sure.

337
00:21:11.598 --> 00:21:15.828
Well, I need to tell Toko's
friends about what happened.

338
00:21:16.128 --> 00:21:17.198
Yagi!

339
00:21:17.668 --> 00:21:21.578
You've got the day off. You should stay home.

340
00:21:21.978 --> 00:21:23.838
Yeah, I know.

341
00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:40.228
The body discovered in the park
belonged to Sergeant Momosaki Toko,

342
00:21:40.578 --> 00:21:45.228
a member of the Transportation Department
like Yumi-san and Naeko-san.

343
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:50.228
The evidence left behind
included a bent 100 yen coin

344
00:21:50.228 --> 00:21:52.118
thought to have been placed next
to the body by the culprit.

345
00:21:52.738 --> 00:21:59.108
There's also the park's swing set the
dying Momosaki-san indicated with blood.

346
00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:04.748
The culprit and the victim
both left separate messages.
