1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.840
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.240
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.040
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.740
A white cup with black lingering scent.

5
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.740
An astounding locked room murder, an invisible murderer!

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:03.762
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 1)"

10
00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:14.262
"24 Hours Close Up With Kogoro Mouri"?

11
00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:17.662
Yes, it's aired at 9 in the morning on Monday, a golden hour.

12
00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:21.662
There are many programs where we cover the daily life of police,

13
00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:25.662
but this time we're focusing on a private detective.

14
00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:27.362
"Shogo Somei (35)" -However, private detectives cannot afford

15
00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:28.662
"President of Production Company" -to have their faces become known

16
00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:32.562
or to have anyone figure out the way they conduct their investigations,

17
00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:35.362
so we were turned down many times.

18
00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:37.862
But since you're very famous, Detective Mouri,

19
00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:39.962
we think that the viewers will be glued to the screen if you appear.

20
00:02:39.962 --> 00:02:42.962
We would really like you to accept this offer.

21
00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:46.862
But you'll be watching me for 24 hours straight, won't you?

22
00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:49.662
Oh, if you don't want the cameras filming you,

23
00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:51.462
just let us know and we'll do away with them.

24
00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.362
"Maiko Kusumi (29)" -You can check the film before it airs

25
00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:56.962
"Production Company's Employee" -and cut the ones you don't want aired.

26
00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:58.262
But...

27
00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.962
You haven't been getting too many job calls recently, have you?

28
00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:03.362
Yes.

29
00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:06.162
It may be a problem to film 24 hours a day because you'll be drinking beer

30
00:03:06.162 --> 00:03:07.662
and listening to the horse races from morning.

31
00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:10.462
And at night, you'll be playing Mahjong.

32
00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:12.762
Don't you have work?

33
00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:15.862
Well, I sort of don't right now.

34
00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.262
Hey.

35
00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:23.962
Well, then. Why don't you prepare something for me?

36
00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:26.962
You can make up an unsolved murder case or something.

37
00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:28.662
Wait, dad!

38
00:03:28.662 --> 00:03:30.362
Make one up?

39
00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:32.362
I don't think that's a good idea.

40
00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:35.162
But maybe we should ask the staff anyway?

41
00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:36.962
It doesn't have to be a murder case.

42
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.162
We could look for cases that would draw the interest of people

43
00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:41.562
-or a troublesome situation. -No, no!

44
00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:43.662
Even if it's not something we made up,

45
00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:45.862
once word goes out that our staff asked him to do the job,

46
00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:47.662
people will suspect that we made it up.

47
00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:51.062
It would also give Detective Mouri a bad reputation.

48
00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:56.762
Besides, considering the time we have until it's aired,

49
00:03:56.762 --> 00:03:59.662
we don't have time to make up something like that either.

50
00:03:59.662 --> 00:04:01.362
That's true.

51
00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:02.662
Excuse me.

52
00:04:02.662 --> 00:04:03.662
Yes?

53
00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:07.162
Are you dating each other by any chance?

54
00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:08.562
-What? -What?

55
00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:13.962
You're both wearing a pair watch.

56
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.462
Oh, no.

57
00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:19.462
This is something she gave me for my birthday.

58
00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:22.162
I liked the design,

59
00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:23.962
so I couldn't help getting the same watch for myself too.

60
00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:27.462
Well. She has been with me right from the time the company was established

61
00:04:27.462 --> 00:04:30.362
and has been taking care of me,

62
00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:32.762
so she's like a wife to me.

63
00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:44.762
But what a shame.

64
00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:47.362
I was so sure that Mr. Mouri would accept the offer,

65
00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:50.062
so I already made arrangements to see Mr. Nakame.

66
00:04:50.062 --> 00:04:51.362
Mr. Nakame?

67
00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:53.762
The producer of Tohto TV.

68
00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:55.362
In fact, Mr. Nakame had asked me

69
00:04:55.362 --> 00:05:02.462
to take you over to his house together with the program production staff.

70
00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:04.262
That's what you get for deciding things on your own

71
00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.862
without asking me first.

72
00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:09.362
I thought that you would immediately take the job

73
00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:11.962
after seeing the name of the narrator of the program.

74
00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:13.362
Narrator?

75
00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:17.162
Yeah. Her name's on the planning report that I gave you a while ago.

76
00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:26.462
Yoko, my dear!

77
00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:31.962
Is Yoko coming to that arrangement meeting too?

78
00:05:31.962 --> 00:05:34.562
Yes, of course.

79
00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:37.362
I will gladly accept your offer!

80
00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.062
Pops is a genuine simpleton.

81
00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:44.662
Mr. Mouri has accepted the job.

82
00:05:44.662 --> 00:05:48.562
It seems that using Yoko Okino as bait worked after all.

83
00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:50.962
Yes, I heard that he was a fan of hers,

84
00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:52.262
but I didn't know that he was that big of a fan.

85
00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:54.762
Well, make sure he doesn't find out that it's a special program

86
00:05:54.762 --> 00:05:56.862
"Raisaku Nakame (52)" -that's will be aired

87
00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:58.362
"Tohto TV's Producer" -in place of a program that's going to be dumped

88
00:05:58.362 --> 00:06:00.962
because of low viewer rating.

89
00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:03.462
Yes, of course.

90
00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.462
Mr. Mouri was all for it.

91
00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:07.662
It's a program that is bound to catch the interest of the viewers

92
00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:10.262
and will never be thought as a program aired in place of another program.

93
00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:13.162
And don't forget about the other stuff too.

94
00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:14.362
The other stuff?

95
00:06:14.362 --> 00:06:16.262
The kick back.

96
00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:18.762
To inflate the invoice of the production fee

97
00:06:18.762 --> 00:06:21.562
and give me the extra cash that comes up.

98
00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:23.362
We'll be making big cash.

99
00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:27.062
Well, I refused a while ago, didn't I?

100
00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:28.162
Is that so?

101
00:06:28.162 --> 00:06:32.562
I thought I could work with you after your long absence. What a shame.

102
00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:34.962
Wait a minute, please.

103
00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:38.162
Well, if you hand her over to me,

104
00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:40.462
I won't push things so far.

105
00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:41.562
Her?

106
00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:44.362
Maiko who works for you.

107
00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.662
-What? -You weren't aware, were you?

108
00:06:47.662 --> 00:06:49.762
The only reason I gave work to a small production company like yours

109
00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:51.462
that was practically ousted from this world

110
00:06:51.462 --> 00:06:54.362
is because she's my favorite.

111
00:06:54.362 --> 00:06:56.562
I want to have an efficient girl like her

112
00:06:56.562 --> 00:07:00.562
to work with me as my secretary.

113
00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:04.162
Moreover, she's beautiful and has a nice figure too.

114
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:06.962
Well, I can't agree to that either.

115
00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:09.762
Well, we can discuss the details

116
00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.562
when you come over to my place with Detective Mouri.

117
00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:23.162
Is anything wrong?

118
00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:25.562
No, it's nothing.

119
00:07:31.562 --> 00:07:34.062
"Somei Productions"

120
00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:38.062
Yes, this is Somei Productions.

121
00:07:38.062 --> 00:07:39.162
Yes.

122
00:07:45.862 --> 00:07:48.262
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

123
00:08:10.062 --> 00:08:12.262
Talk about being late.

124
00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:13.762
It's more than 30 minutes past the scheduled time.

125
00:08:13.762 --> 00:08:16.962
Yoko. Yoko.

126
00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:20.762
Well, I guess someone doesn't seem to mind at all.

127
00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:26.962
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mouri.

128
00:08:26.962 --> 00:08:28.362
No problem at all.

129
00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:32.562
I'll go and park the car in the parking lot then.

130
00:08:37.062 --> 00:08:39.262
Where's my dear Yoko?

131
00:08:39.262 --> 00:08:43.062
Maybe she's already at the producer's house.

132
00:08:43.062 --> 00:08:46.862
His jacket was pretty wet.

133
00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:52.662
What? Yoko can't come?

134
00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:55.162
It seems something suddenly came up,

135
00:08:55.162 --> 00:08:58.862
so the formal arrangement meeting will be set for another day.

136
00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:01.362
None of the staff is here either today.

137
00:09:03.562 --> 00:09:05.762
Are you all right?

138
00:09:05.762 --> 00:09:06.762
What?

139
00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:10.762
You look a bit more tired than the last time we saw you.

140
00:09:10.762 --> 00:09:13.962
Well. I've got a lot of things on my mind.

141
00:09:13.962 --> 00:09:16.162
"2003, Nakame"

142
00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:20.062
No answer.

143
00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:22.962
Maybe he went out somewhere because we're late.

144
00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:25.062
I... I don't think so.

145
00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:29.362
We've got no choice. Why don't we come back some other time?

146
00:09:29.362 --> 00:09:30.962
Besides, Yoko's not here either.

147
00:09:30.962 --> 00:09:32.662
Please wait.

148
00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:35.062
Maybe something's wrong.

149
00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:37.362
Huh? Like what?

150
00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:39.562
Well, the fact is,

151
00:09:39.562 --> 00:09:42.662
Producer Nakame has been acting strange lately.

152
00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:45.262
Remember the news some time ago

153
00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:47.862
about Tohto TV's made up program scandal?

154
00:09:47.862 --> 00:09:51.462
Yeah, the scandal about the travel program.

155
00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:52.562
Yes.

156
00:09:52.562 --> 00:09:56.362
Although Mr. Nakame had nothing to do with the scandal,

157
00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:59.062
he felt responsible for it because he's the one

158
00:09:59.062 --> 00:10:01.162
who started the program.

159
00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:04.462
Recently, whenever he went drinking,

160
00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:06.662
he would complain about it.

161
00:10:06.662 --> 00:10:08.362
He said he wanted to die.

162
00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:11.062
-What? -That... That's why

163
00:10:11.062 --> 00:10:14.662
he might have fallen into depression again while waiting for us.

164
00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:18.062
Then go and explain the situation to the condo manager right away

165
00:10:18.062 --> 00:10:19.262
and get a spare key!

166
00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:21.662
-Right this minute! -Yes, sir!

167
00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:30.862
-Thanks for the trouble. -No problem.

168
00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:33.762
The door's chain-locked.

169
00:10:33.762 --> 00:10:36.662
It seems he's inside the room after all.

170
00:10:36.662 --> 00:10:39.962
Mr. Nakame! Is anything wrong?

171
00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:41.162
We've got no choice.

172
00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:43.662
Let's cut the chain lock and go inside.

173
00:10:43.662 --> 00:10:45.262
Will you please do it?

174
00:10:45.262 --> 00:10:46.562
Yes, sir.

175
00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:52.762
Mr. Nakame, we're coming in!

176
00:10:52.762 --> 00:10:55.162
Where are the slippers?

177
00:10:55.162 --> 00:10:56.962
You can go in with your shoes on.

178
00:10:56.962 --> 00:10:59.662
Mr. Nakame had lived abroad for quite some time.

179
00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:00.862
Oh, I see.

180
00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.862
I'll go check the living room on this side.

181
00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:07.262
Mr. Mouri, would you please go check the study on that side?

182
00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:09.362
-Okay. -Mr. Nakame!

183
00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:12.162
What shall we do, Conan?

184
00:11:12.162 --> 00:11:14.162
Should we go inside too?

185
00:11:14.162 --> 00:11:16.262
You stay here at the front door, Ran.

186
00:11:16.262 --> 00:11:18.262
Mr. Nakame!

187
00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:20.062
What's the matter?

188
00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:21.662
-Stay right there! -Hey, wait!

189
00:11:21.662 --> 00:11:23.162
Mr. Nakame!

190
00:11:24.762 --> 00:11:26.562
Please hang on!

191
00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:29.762
Mr. Nakame! Mr. Nakame!

192
00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:33.562
Hey, what's the matter?

193
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.162
I came into the living room and found Mr. Nakame on the floor.

194
00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.662
-He's not moving. -What?

195
00:11:41.262 --> 00:11:43.762
I smell the scent of almond from his mouth.

196
00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:47.062
Cyanide poisoning.

197
00:11:47.062 --> 00:11:49.962
He must've mixed it in his coffee and drunk it.

198
00:11:49.962 --> 00:11:52.362
It... It's my fault.

199
00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:55.162
It's all because I was late. That's why Mr. Nakame...

200
00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:57.662
Stop blaming yourself

201
00:11:57.662 --> 00:12:00.462
and call the police and ambulance right away!

202
00:12:00.462 --> 00:12:01.762
Yes, sir.

203
00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:08.262
Hello, is this the police?

204
00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:11.262
There's a dead person.

205
00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:13.462
Please rush over here.

206
00:12:13.462 --> 00:12:16.462
The address? The address is...

207
00:12:16.462 --> 00:12:19.262
Tohto Sky Mansion, 20th floor.

208
00:12:30.262 --> 00:12:34.162
As expected, this is not suicide...

209
00:12:34.162 --> 00:12:35.962
but it's homicide.

210
00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:39.462
And the one who schemed this is probably...

211
00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:43.562
Could it be...

212
00:12:56.715 --> 00:13:00.615
A special program featuring a detective and staying with him for 24 hours.

213
00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:01.615
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.615
In order to make arrangements for the program,

215
00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:06.715
you came here to the TV producer's residence.

216
00:13:06.715 --> 00:13:09.015
You rang the doorbell, and since there was no answer,

217
00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:11.715
you entered the room and found the producer,

218
00:13:11.715 --> 00:13:17.615
Raisaku Nakame dead after drinking the poisoned coffee.

219
00:13:17.615 --> 00:13:19.015
Yes.

220
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.815
Since there was no answer,

221
00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:23.615
we had the condo manager open the door for us.

222
00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:25.115
It was chain-locked, so he cut the chain.

223
00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:28.015
This is what we found when we came into the room.

224
00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:31.415
And? You were asked to accept this job offer

225
00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:33.815
and came to make arrangements with President Somei

226
00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:36.115
of this program production company.

227
00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.415
And the detective who unfortunately

228
00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:45.515
encountered this case by accident happened to be you again, Mr. Mouri?

229
00:13:45.515 --> 00:13:47.415
Yes, inspector.

230
00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:50.115
Don't you think it's strange?

231
00:13:50.115 --> 00:13:52.215
I mean, it's not like we're shooting a mystery series or something.

232
00:13:52.215 --> 00:13:55.815
Why is it that you always happen to...

233
00:13:55.815 --> 00:13:59.115
No, I guess I'll stop here because it's kind of ridiculous.

234
00:13:59.115 --> 00:14:01.315
That... that's true.

235
00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:05.615
So what's the cause of death? Was it due to cyanide poisoning after all?

236
00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:07.615
As for that...

237
00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:09.215
How was it, Tome-san?

238
00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:13.215
I can't say much about it until the results of the postmortem are out.

239
00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:17.215
But there's probably no mistake about it.

240
00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:23.015
The time of death is estimated to be a little before 6.30 in the evening.

241
00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:27.215
Anyway, it's amazing that you went as far as

242
00:14:27.215 --> 00:14:28.815
to cut the chain lock of the door to get in.

243
00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:31.915
It's because of what President Somei told us.

244
00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:36.315
He said that Mr. Nakame had always thought about committing suicide,

245
00:14:36.315 --> 00:14:39.415
so we thought it was urgent.

246
00:14:39.415 --> 00:14:40.715
I see.

247
00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:44.915
Inspector, we can't drop the possibility of this being a murder case yet.

248
00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:47.115
What? Why not?

249
00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:49.215
Isn't this a case of suicide

250
00:14:49.215 --> 00:14:53.215
since the door was chain-locked from inside?

251
00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:57.115
Well, it's true that this room was locked.

252
00:14:57.115 --> 00:14:59.215
However, just because he drank poison,

253
00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:01.015
it doesn't mean that he committed suicide.

254
00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:02.915
Is... Is that so?

255
00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:06.815
The killer could've come to Mr. Nakame's room with the cake

256
00:15:06.815 --> 00:15:09.515
and insert poison into the coffee.

257
00:15:09.515 --> 00:15:11.915
He then said that he had to leave because of urgent business.

258
00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:13.215
Upon leaving,

259
00:15:13.215 --> 00:15:15.215
the killer could've told Mr. Nakame that it's dangerous nowadays

260
00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:17.315
to make him use the chain lock for safety reasons.

261
00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:20.115
In that case, this situation is very easy to set up.

262
00:15:20.115 --> 00:15:22.215
After the killer left the room,

263
00:15:22.215 --> 00:15:27.115
all Mr. Nakame had to do was sit down and drink the poisoned coffee.

264
00:15:27.115 --> 00:15:28.715
I see.

265
00:15:28.715 --> 00:15:33.915
By the way, where were you around the estimated time of his death?

266
00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:35.715
Are you suspecting me?

267
00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:38.715
No, but you're the first one who found him,

268
00:15:38.715 --> 00:15:41.515
so I'm asking just to be sure.

269
00:15:42.915 --> 00:15:45.315
I haven't been feeling too well recently.

270
00:15:45.315 --> 00:15:48.015
So, I took off from work and slept at home.

271
00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:52.915
I got a call from Mr. Mouri just around 6.30 pm.

272
00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:56.415
He reminded me that I was supposed to meet Mr. Nakame at 7.00 pm.

273
00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:57.915
So, I came here.

274
00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:02.015
I was sleeping all day, so I'm feeling a lot better now.

275
00:16:02.015 --> 00:16:04.515
Hold it! Does that mean that you had forgotten

276
00:16:04.515 --> 00:16:06.215
that we were supposed to have an arrangement meeting?

277
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:07.715
Yes, I'm sorry.

278
00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:11.415
Did you pick up the call on your home phone?

279
00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:13.415
No.

280
00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:15.315
I picked it up on this cell phone.

281
00:16:15.315 --> 00:16:17.615
Then, is there anyone who can prove

282
00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:20.515
that you were sleeping all day in your room?

283
00:16:20.515 --> 00:16:21.915
There isn't.

284
00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:25.515
Proof? Are you suspecting me after all?

285
00:16:25.515 --> 00:16:28.115
No, no. This is just for confirmation.

286
00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.315
Why did you make that sound?

287
00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:37.215
Strange. The bottom of the saucer of the cup...

288
00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:38.915
Don't go touching stuff!

289
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.115
Didn't I tell you not to touch anything?

290
00:16:41.115 --> 00:16:44.115
See, there are traces that coffee spilled.

291
00:16:44.115 --> 00:16:45.615
What?

292
00:16:45.615 --> 00:16:48.815
Normally, if the coffee spilled while the coffee cup was on the saucer,

293
00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:52.015
there should be a circular trace of coffee on the saucer,

294
00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:55.015
but there isn't any circular trace on this table.

295
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:59.315
All it has are two thin streaks.

296
00:16:59.315 --> 00:17:03.315
There's no coffee underneath the saucer either.

297
00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:04.915
That's true.

298
00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:07.915
Maybe these two thin streaks

299
00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:11.715
are that of the coffee cup and the handle of the cup.

300
00:17:13.015 --> 00:17:16.115
If you leave the cup of coffee toppled as is,

301
00:17:16.115 --> 00:17:18.415
the parts that touch the table

302
00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:20.815
like the coffee cup and the handle won't leave traces underneath.

303
00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:24.815
If so, after Mr. Nakame drank the poisoned coffee and fell onto the floor,

304
00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:28.015
someone deliberately put the coffee cup back on the saucer

305
00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:33.215
and placed it on the table after the coffee dried up?

306
00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:35.615
But who would do something like that?

307
00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:37.815
And for what reason?

308
00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:40.615
We can't tell the reason yet,

309
00:17:40.615 --> 00:17:43.815
but it's obvious who did it.

310
00:17:43.815 --> 00:17:47.315
The only person who could've done that after the coffee dried up

311
00:17:47.315 --> 00:17:51.715
would be the first person who entered this room and found the dead body.

312
00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:54.915
It couldn't be anyone other than President Somei, right?

313
00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:58.515
Hey, Conan. What are you saying?

314
00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:00.015
That boy sure says strange things.

315
00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:04.115
No. It's true that you're the only one who could do it.

316
00:18:04.115 --> 00:18:08.415
It would take just about an hour for the spilled coffee to dry up.

317
00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:11.615
The estimated time of murder is around 6.30 pm.

318
00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:15.715
We entered this locked room shortly after 7.30 pm

319
00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:18.315
or rather, before 8.00 pm.

320
00:18:18.315 --> 00:18:21.615
So, the spilled coffee would've dried up.

321
00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:24.715
I'm sure that you went into the room before everyone else

322
00:18:24.715 --> 00:18:27.715
in order to hide evidence that you failed to erase

323
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:30.215
using the saucer of the coffee cup.

324
00:18:30.215 --> 00:18:31.815
Isn't that right?

325
00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:35.815
What kind of evidence is that supposed to be?

326
00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:38.115
The only thing that was found underneath the saucer that the cup was on

327
00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:40.615
was the trace of spilled coffee, right?

328
00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:44.415
Why would I have to go out of my way to hide something like that?

329
00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:46.715
The trace of the spilled coffee?

330
00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.415
Hey, please let me go, Ran!

331
00:18:53.415 --> 00:18:56.215
-Ran! -Hey! Conan.

332
00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:06.415
No.

333
00:19:06.415 --> 00:19:09.315
This is no ordinary murder.

334
00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.215
This is an impossible crime!

335
00:19:12.215 --> 00:19:13.815
What's the matter, Conan?

336
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:15.715
What's with that frightening look of yours?

337
00:19:15.715 --> 00:19:17.115
Hey.

338
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.115
Don't you think there's something strange

339
00:19:19.115 --> 00:19:21.715
about this spilled coffee?

340
00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:23.915
Like I said, the saucer was...

341
00:19:23.915 --> 00:19:25.815
It's the floor. The floor.

342
00:19:25.815 --> 00:19:28.815
Huh? What's strange?

343
00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:32.415
The spilled coffee went from the table to the chair.

344
00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:34.315
Then it spilled along the leg of the chair

345
00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:37.715
and dripped onto the carpet on the floor.

346
00:19:37.715 --> 00:19:40.615
That's the front leg to the left.

347
00:19:40.615 --> 00:19:44.115
Look slightly to the front part of the front right leg of the chair.

348
00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:47.915
There is a round empty space around the coffee stain.

349
00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:50.415
This shows that when the coffee spilled,

350
00:19:50.415 --> 00:19:53.915
the front right leg of the chair was there, right?

351
00:19:53.915 --> 00:19:55.015
Yeah.

352
00:19:55.015 --> 00:19:57.115
Why did the chair move?

353
00:19:57.115 --> 00:20:00.715
Because for some reason, he moved it

354
00:20:00.715 --> 00:20:03.615
when he came into this room.

355
00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:05.515
That's enough!

356
00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:07.215
But isn't it strange

357
00:20:07.215 --> 00:20:09.615
where the stain is, if he moved it

358
00:20:09.615 --> 00:20:11.015
after the coffee dried up?

359
00:20:11.015 --> 00:20:14.815
That's why. Take a good look.

360
00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:18.815
First, the chair was placed this way.

361
00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:20.215
See.

362
00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:22.815
If you match the stain to the right front leg,

363
00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:25.415
the stain on the other side falls out of place.

364
00:20:27.215 --> 00:20:29.815
So that means when the coffee first spilled,

365
00:20:29.815 --> 00:20:31.915
the chair was placed this way.

366
00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:33.015
But before the coffee spilled

367
00:20:33.015 --> 00:20:35.215
and went down the left front leg of the chair,

368
00:20:35.215 --> 00:20:37.815
the chair moved this way, right?

369
00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:41.715
That's true, but the chair couldn't have moved on its own.

370
00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:45.715
Other person couldn't have been sitting in the chair either.

371
00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:49.315
Yes.

372
00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:51.715
This is obvious proof that when the coffee spilled,

373
00:20:51.715 --> 00:20:56.715
someone was sitting on this chair.

374
00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:59.215
Right, Pops?

375
00:20:59.215 --> 00:21:00.815
Yeah.

376
00:21:00.815 --> 00:21:03.415
Hold... Hold it there!

377
00:21:03.415 --> 00:21:08.215
That means if the front door was locked and chain-locked too,

378
00:21:08.215 --> 00:21:10.915
and all that was found in the room was the dead body,

379
00:21:10.915 --> 00:21:12.215
don't tell me that...

380
00:21:12.215 --> 00:21:14.415
It's an impossible crime.

381
00:21:15.615 --> 00:21:19.315
It's a locked room murder.

382
00:21:19.315 --> 00:21:21.715
It could be that when we entered the room,

383
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:26.915
the killer was still hiding inside, and escaped amidst the commotion.

384
00:21:26.915 --> 00:21:29.815
I don't think so.

385
00:21:29.815 --> 00:21:34.515
Because I stayed by the front door after Conan told me to do so,

386
00:21:34.515 --> 00:21:38.515
but no one other than the police went through the door.

387
00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:40.415
What?

388
00:21:40.415 --> 00:21:43.515
Yes. This is an impossible crime.

389
00:21:43.515 --> 00:21:45.515
A locked room murder.

390
00:21:45.515 --> 00:21:48.115
The TV producer, Mr. Raisaku Nakame

391
00:21:48.115 --> 00:21:51.215
drank poisoned coffee and was murdered.

392
00:21:51.215 --> 00:21:54.515
The coffee that spilled on the table dried up,

393
00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:59.315
and deception was schemed by placing a saucer under the coffee cup.

394
00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:00.515
Based on this situation,

395
00:22:00.515 --> 00:22:03.115
it was deduced that when Mr. Nakame drank the poisoned coffee,

396
00:22:03.115 --> 00:22:07.015
the killer was no longer in the room.

397
00:22:07.015 --> 00:22:09.115
The only one capable of scheming the deception

398
00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:12.915
would've been Mr. Somei, the first one who entered the room.

399
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:17.315
However, from the coffee stain found on the floor

400
00:22:17.315 --> 00:22:19.915
that was out of place from the position of the leg of the chair,

401
00:22:19.915 --> 00:22:21.315
it became clear

402
00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:25.115
that someone was sitting on that chair at the time the coffee spilled.

403
00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:27.415
If that someone is the killer,

404
00:22:27.415 --> 00:22:30.615
how did he get out of this room?

405
00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.615
When we arrived at the condo,

406
00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:36.015
the front door was locked and even chain-locked.

407
00:22:37.115 --> 00:22:39.015
This locked room murder...

408
00:22:39.015 --> 00:22:42.915
What kind of trick did the killer use?

409
00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:13.115
Why are you making that sound again?

410
00:24:13.115 --> 00:24:15.515
Come on, it's the third time today.

411
00:24:15.515 --> 00:24:17.715
He said that he's hungry

412
00:24:17.715 --> 00:24:21.115
and wants to eat the cake that's on the table.

413
00:24:22.115 --> 00:24:25.315
The aroma of coffee. Just as I thought.

414
00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:29.315
If so, there is only one answer.

415
00:24:29.315 --> 00:24:34.115
The one and only sad truth.

416
00:24:34.115 --> 00:24:39.015
Next Conan, "Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 2)"

417
00:24:55.315 --> 00:24:57.415
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:57.415 --> 00:24:59.515
"Cake"

419
00:24:59.515 --> 00:25:01.415
-I want to eat some cake. I want it. -No, that's not the hint.

420
00:25:01.415 --> 00:25:02.715
-I want to eat it. -Read it the other way around.

421
00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:04.515
You mean, "ekac"?
