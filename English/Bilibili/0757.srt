1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,040
Hey!

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,240
Four eyes, were you caught for doing something bad?

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,740
That's not it, Mr. Mouri.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,040
He turned in a wallet that he found on the street.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,740
What? Bummers.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,940
Didn't you go to play pachinko, Pops?

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,340
I overslept a bit,

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,140
so when I got there all the good machines were taken.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,040
11:30 am.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,140
You overslept more than just a little.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,140
You brat!

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,740
Excuse me.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,440
He's...

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Aren't you the comedian?

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
Yes. I'm Rokusuke Dodonpa.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,940
The lying stand-up comedian, Dodonpa.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,340
I'm telling you, it's true, everybody!

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,540
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,140
What brings you here, Dodonpa?

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,940
-"Rokusuke Dodonpa (30)" -The talent agency that I belong to

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,040
is just up this street.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,440
I killed...

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,740
the president there.

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,940
What?

25
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,940
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,740
The comedian who turns himself in receives unexpected evaluation.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,540
Something is hidden behind the laughter

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,440
His name is Detective Conan.

32
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:27,504
"The Comedian Who Turned Himself In (Part 1)"

33
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,404
Inspector Megure.

34
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:43,104
I asked the condominium manager, Mr. Ueki,

35
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:45,604
to get a vacant room ready for us.

36
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:47,604
I'm sorry to trouble you.

37
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:51,104
We're busy at the Beika police station because of other cases.

38
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:53,104
Please give me the details then, will you?

39
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:55,604
-Yes, sir. -Let me sit in too.

40
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,604
No need to.

41
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:02,704
I'm sure that I can be of some kind of help to you.

42
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:05,704
Besides, you're the world's greatest detective, after all, right?

43
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,404
You must really have a lot of time on your hands.

44
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:10,104
Stage name, Rokusuke Dodonpa,

45
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:12,404
proper name, Rokusuke Tanigaki.

46
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:15,104
Residence at Akebono City, 3-chome.

47
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:19,604
The late Hideki Tendo was running a talent agency at this address,

48
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:22,404
which was also his residence.

49
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,004
It seems that the Mr. Dodonpa

50
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:27,204
was the only talent he had working at his agency.

51
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:29,204
He was the president as well as my manager.

52
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:32,804
We were in this together from the start.

53
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,504
He was a precious partner.

54
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,304
And you're saying

55
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:42,304
that you killed that precious partner of yours?

56
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,404
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:47,204
I was working on a new material this week, you see.

58
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,804
And I had an appointment to show it to him today.

59
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,904
So, I went to his office.

60
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,504
It was around 11:10 am.

61
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:58,804
There!

62
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,804
I'm telling you, it's true, everybody!

63
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:04,404
Dodonpa, Dodonpa never lies.

64
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,104
-"Hideki Tendo (42)" -That's why your act

65
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,904
is always superficial and shows no growth!

66
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:10,104
Just what do you mean?

67
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,504
I'm telling you that your act is not even a performance!

68
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:14,704
You don't know a thing.

69
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:17,404
What the audience wants is...

70
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:21,704
We got into an argument over differences in what we consider performance.

71
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,404
I blew my top

72
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:26,504
and picked up the bat that was left standing

73
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,404
against the wall in the room.

74
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,604
And I...

75
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:36,604
I'm very sorry.

76
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:43,304
Judging from the way he is deeply apologetic over what he did,

77
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,804
it seems that his confession is not a lie.

78
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:55,904
-But... -Where is he? That room?

79
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,404
Is it true that Mr. Rokuske Dodonpa

80
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,104
killed the president of the talent agency he belongs to

81
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:01,404
and turned himself in?

82
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,104
No...

83
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,504
You can't come in!

84
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:07,404
We're still just hearing him out.

85
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,604
I'll comment on this later!

86
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,404
I'm counting on you.

87
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,204
Let's head home too.

88
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,504
It's just a waste of time staying here any longer.

89
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:19,204
No matter how angry you get,

90
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:23,204
would you kill your precious partner with a metal bat?

91
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,204
What?

92
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:29,704
That's what's bothering me too, Mr. Dodonpa.

93
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:31,504
Go immediately and find evidence to corroborate his story.

94
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,504
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

95
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:33,504
You heard him.

96
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:36,304
Why don't we stay a while longer until everything's confirmed.

97
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:39,304
There could be a chance for the Great Detective to show his talents too.

98
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:40,804
I guess so.

99
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:45,804
"Beika Station"

100
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:49,104
He arrived at Beika Station at 11 am.

101
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,704
It's about a ten minute walk from the station to the crime scene,

102
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:56,804
so he would've reached the office around 11:10 am.

103
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:59,404
After a short while, he gets into an argument and kills his partner.

104
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,204
Then, he arrives at the police box in front of the station

105
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:04,904
and turns himself in at 11:30 am.

106
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:08,204
As far as the time is concerned, everything fits into place.

107
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,804
Yes, sir. I'll go ask around other vaudevillians.

108
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:15,504
To see if he had any problems with the victim.

109
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,004
Okay. Do that, will you?

110
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,204
I'll attend the autopsy then.

111
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,504
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:25,404
I see. Good work.

113
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,004
It's from forensics.

114
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:30,604
They've confirmed the blood and hair that was found on the bat

115
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:34,804
belongs to the victim, Hideki Tendo.

116
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:39,104
Moreover, his prints were also found on the bat.

117
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,404
So, that's the murder weapon, eh?

118
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:45,404
Like I've been telling you, I struck him with it.

119
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,304
"Beika Theater"

120
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:49,204
Which means that Mr. Dodonpa

121
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:53,004
had a grudge against Mr. Tendo because of that?

122
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:55,004
Of course I'd hold a grudge against him.

123
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,804
After all, I got an offer to perform

124
00:07:56,804 --> 00:08:00,404
on a popular variety show, and yet...

125
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:02,704
He turned it down without even asking me,

126
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,404
saying he didn't like that program.

127
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:11,904
In other words, you were in conflict with Mr. Tendo since then.

128
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:16,004
I'm sure that also helped trigger losing my temper.

129
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:20,904
Otherwise, I would've never impulsively struck him with a bat.

130
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,204
Under all these circumstances,

131
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:27,504
I don't think there's any room for doubt.

132
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:30,204
Maybe my suspicions are groundless.

133
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,304
"Tendo Talent Agency"

134
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:41,004
There's something about him.

135
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:48,004
What's wrong, manager?

136
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,104
What?

137
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:55,304
When I cleaned this back entrance area this morning, it wasn't here.

138
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:56,704
This thing.

139
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,304
A steel pipe?

140
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,204
It's used at construction sites, right?

141
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:03,604
I wonder who brought it here?

142
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:08,004
What time did you start cleaning up this morning?

143
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:09,604
Officer Takagi?

144
00:09:12,504 --> 00:09:13,504
That's not it?

145
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:14,504
No, sir.

146
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:17,504
What's wrong, Inspector?

147
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:18,704
The murder weapon!

148
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:21,604
It wasn't the metal bat.

149
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:25,804
During the autopsy,

150
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:29,204
after matching the shape of the wound to that metal bat,

151
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:32,304
a subtle difference was detected.

152
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:35,504
The murder weapon seems to be a blunt cylindrical object, though.

153
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:39,004
Excuse me, Officer Takagi.

154
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:40,404
I got it.

155
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,404
Good work, Conan.

156
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:43,804
So, it was that after all.

157
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,504
Yes.

158
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,204
Not only did the shape match,

159
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:51,004
but the concrete piece found on the head wound of Mr. Tendo

160
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:56,004
also matched with the piece that was stuck onto the pipe.

161
00:09:56,004 --> 00:10:00,704
Moreover, Mr. Tendo's blood was also detected in the steel pipe.

162
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:01,704
In other words,

163
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:03,904
the steel pipe that was at the back entrance

164
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:07,804
was indeed the murder weapon that was used to kill Mr. Tendo.

165
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:12,804
Then, what with the metal bat?

166
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:14,104
I know, right?

167
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:15,504
It's not the murder weapon,

168
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:20,304
and yet, Mr. Tendo's blood and hair were found on it too.

169
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:23,504
Just what's going on, Mr. Dodonpa?

170
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,404
Well...

171
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:29,804
Anyway...

172
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:33,504
Either way, I killed him!

173
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:36,104
I killed the president with my very hands.

174
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,104
I did it! I'm the killer!

175
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:42,604
It's finally starting to get very interesting.

176
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:47,304
It looks like he wants to be the killer no matter what.

177
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:50,504
The killer of a crime he didn't even commit.

178
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:53,904
Does he know the real killer and is protecting the real killer?

179
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:14,738
Mr. Ueki, Inspector Megure wanted me to ask you.

180
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:17,738
This morning at about the same time that Mr. Dodonpa came,

181
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:20,538
there should've been someone who went in and out of the condominium.

182
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:23,238
You mean around 11 am?

183
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:29,038
I don't recall anyone.

184
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:32,038
Since it was a holiday, there weren't many people going in and out,

185
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:35,638
so if there was anyone, I'm sure I would've remembered.

186
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:40,738
I guess Mr. Dodonpa didn't directly see the killer.

187
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:43,738
The only people who went in and out this morning

188
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:47,038
are Mr. and Mrs. Mori who went on a trip

189
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:50,438
and Mr. Tendo who went out to buy his bento.

190
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,838
What time was that?

191
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:57,638
At around what time did Mr. Tendo come to buy his bento?

192
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,338
7:58 am.

193
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,338
What about it?

194
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:15,438
Do you know what kind of bento he warmed up?

195
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:17,938
Let's see...

196
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,338
Hamburger bento.

197
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,238
Did he pour hot water into the cup noodles?

198
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:26,838
Yes, Mr. Tendo always does that.

199
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:29,038
Thank you very much.

200
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,538
What?

201
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,238
What now?

202
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:42,038
By the way, Mr. Dodonpa.

203
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:45,838
Where were you around 9 am?

204
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,138
What's the importance?

205
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:51,838
Just for reference.

206
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:57,338
Oh, at around 9 am I was at Suda Sensei's atelier.

207
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,438
At 9 am. It can't be.

208
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:02,038
Yes, that's just it.

209
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:03,738
From the results of the autopsy,

210
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,038
judging from the food that was digested,

211
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:11,838
it was found that Mr. Tendo was killed an hour or so after he ate.

212
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,838
He had hamburger bento and cup noodles.

213
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:20,738
He bought both at the convenience store at 7:58 am.

214
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:24,138
And he had the bento heated,

215
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,538
as well as poured hot water into the cup noodles so,

216
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,638
he probably went home and ate it right away, no?

217
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:32,038
Right. At around 8 am,

218
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:35,538
Mr. Tendo must've eaten the bento and cup noodles.

219
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:39,138
What? If he was killed an hour after that...

220
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:40,238
Yes.

221
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:44,738
So Mr. Dodonpa, it wasn't after 11 am as you said,

222
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:48,238
but the actual time Mr. Tendo was killed,

223
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:53,138
was at around 9 am, two hours before that.

224
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:56,338
But, at that time, Mr. Dodonpa you were...

225
00:13:56,338 --> 00:14:00,038
Who is this Suda Sensei that you said you visited?

226
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:06,038
Oh, well. We can easily find out by checking, you know.

227
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:15,738
She's an artist that lives near my home In Akebono City.

228
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:18,838
Officer Takagi join Officer Chiba and head over, will you?

229
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,038
Yes, sir!

230
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,038
I guess you weren't needed, Pops.

231
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:32,738
"Atelier"

232
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:38,038
Ms. Suda, are you in?

233
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,738
Yes.

234
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:46,038
-"Izumi Suda (68)" -Who's asking?

235
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:47,638
Are you still resting?

236
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,538
We're sorry to intrude on you.

237
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:53,638
I got to know him about six months ago,

238
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,438
but I didn't know him at all

239
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:58,338
even if he introduced himself as an entertainer.

240
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:03,238
Because you see, I don't have a TV, radio or cell phone

241
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:07,538
I don't live in the real, you see.

242
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:14,038
We want to know if Mr. Dodonpa came to see you this morning.

243
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,138
Yes, he came.

244
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:18,938
He brought back the drawing collection

245
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:22,438
that I lent him for him to think up new material for his performance.

246
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:27,138
He called me last night that he'd be coming here at 9 am.

247
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:28,538
And he did so.

248
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,838
Are you sure it was at 9 am?

249
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:35,038
Yes, because I looked at that clock,

250
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:36,838
so I'm sure.

251
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,038
I brought back the drawing collection that you lent me.

252
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,038
And, this is the cake that you like, Ms. Suda.

253
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:46,638
Huh? Did I come at the wrong time?

254
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:48,538
What?

255
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,638
No, you're right on time.

256
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:52,838
Come on in.

257
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:56,838
Yes, Mr. Dodonpa came here at 9 am sharp.

258
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:03,938
Impossible. He couldn't have killed Mr. Tendo.

259
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:07,638
That's right, because that clock was working okay,

260
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:11,038
and it takes more than an hour from there to get to the crime scene.

261
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,738
His alibi is established.

262
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:26,438
I wanted to be the killer.

263
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:30,038
Does that mean you know who the real killer is

264
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:34,638
and want to protect him and take his place?

265
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:38,538
Oh, no. That's not it.

266
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:40,638
Just what do you mean?

267
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:44,238
The thing I wanted to protect was...

268
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:49,538
I wanted to protect Mr. Tendo's reputation.

269
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:50,638
Reputation?

270
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:53,638
Mr. Tendo, helped me get through.

271
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,138
He was priceless and I owed my life to him.

272
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:59,438
But, he there was another part to him!

273
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,038
Well, think over well,

274
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:05,838
what would be most beneficial for you.

275
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:15,038
It seemed that he knew the weak spots of the people in show biz,

276
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,538
and was blackmailing them with it.

277
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,838
Blackmailing?

278
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:25,638
When I went to the office a little after 11 am today,

279
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:27,738
I found Mr. Tendo lying on the floor.

280
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,938
He was already dead.

281
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:33,638
Maybe somebody that he was blackmailing killed him to shut him up.

282
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:36,838
I can't think of any other reason.

283
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:41,538
That's why I couldn't directly report the incident to the police.

284
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,438
If the police searched for the killer,

285
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:48,138
Mr. Tendo's corrupt evil side would be exposed.

286
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:51,038
I just didn't want that to happen.

287
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,938
That's why I decided to say that I killed him because of our differences

288
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:58,638
in thinking when it came to performance.

289
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:01,938
I could tell that he died after being struck on the head.

290
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:05,438
But since the murder weapon wasn't there,

291
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:08,538
I decided to make the bat that happened by putting my prints on it,

292
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:11,038
to be there the murder weapon.

293
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,438
Then, I turned myself in at the police box in front of the train station.

294
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:20,538
I'm very sorry

295
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:23,138
for causing you trouble.

296
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:27,538
What kind of thing and who was Mr. Tendo blackmailing?

297
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,538
About that...

298
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:32,338
I have no idea.

299
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:36,438
I understand that you did it, out of your consideration for Mr. Tendo,

300
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:40,038
but, it's not okay to touch the crime scene, right?

301
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,138
Yes,

302
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:42,638
that's a crime.

303
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,238
Exactly.

304
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,338
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:53,438
But investigation of the murder case is top priority for now.

306
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,738
As for your actions,

307
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:59,738
we'll pursue deeper into that after this case is solved.

308
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,638
You may go home for today.

309
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:02,638
What?

310
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,338
But...

311
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,138
I understand how you feel,

312
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,638
so be sure to leave your contact number with us.

313
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:09,938
I'm sorry

314
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,738
for the trouble I caused you.

315
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:30,138
Okay, let's start over.

316
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:34,338
I wonder who the real killer that killed Mr. Hideki Tendo is?

317
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:36,638
As he was saying,

318
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,038
the first ones to emerge as suspects

319
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:40,838
would be the ones who were being blackmailed.

320
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:43,938
Right, do everything you can to get to them.

321
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,038
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

322
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,538
I didn't have the chance to display

323
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,638
the talents of a great detective after all.

324
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:57,038
I wonder why the real killer took that steel pipe

325
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,538
that was the actual murder weapon away from the crime scene?

326
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:03,538
Maybe the killer's fingerprints were left on it or something.

327
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,638
But, then wouldn't he have taken it home?

328
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,038
It was left by the store room by the back entrance.

329
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:16,138
Well... that's why it was immediately found by the condominium manager.

330
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:18,638
The killer didn't want to leave it behind at the crime scene

331
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:22,938
but leave it at the back entrance of the condominium instead.

332
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:25,438
Moreover, it was out in the open.

333
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,838
Were they waiting here all this time?

334
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:38,638
Mr. Dodonpa's surrounded.

335
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,938
I'm sorry, everyone.

336
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:48,838
I, Rokusuke Dodonpa, in order to save the reputation of Hideki Tendo,

337
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,838
wanted to take the place of the killer.

338
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:55,138
For this single reason, I lied and turned myself in.

339
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:58,438
I am really sorry.

340
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:04,038
Everyone throughout Japan understands how you feel, Mr. Dodonpa.

341
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:08,038
I appreciate you saying so.

342
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:13,238
Please deliver this to the head office.

343
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:17,238
How did you all find out that Mr. Dodonpa turned himself in?

344
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:22,738
We were informed.

345
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,638
We each received an anonymous call at our company.

346
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:28,238
Who'd leak out such information?

347
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:30,438
The ones who knew were...

348
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:36,138
I killed the president there.

349
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:37,938
What?

350
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:41,838
It's unthinkable that police officer would leak the info.

351
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:43,838
It's neither Pops nor me.

352
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:46,038
Then, the only one left would be...

353
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:52,138
Maybe his real motive

354
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:56,338
wasn't becoming the killer of a case that he didn't even commit

355
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,838
but to make everyone think he did.

356
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:06,638
Besides, around 9 am when Mr. Tendo was killed.

357
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:10,838
He visited a person called Ms. Suda

358
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:16,538
after promising the night before that he'd visit her at 9 am.

359
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:22,438
The exact time that Mr. Tendo was killed is 9 am.

360
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:26,138
It fits in too well to be a coincidence.

361
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:56,538
Pops was concerned about the steel pipe, the murder weapon but...

362
00:23:56,538 --> 00:24:00,138
On the way back from Beika Station there was a construction site,

363
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,438
and it seems to have been brought from there.

364
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:05,738
Did the killer contact you?

365
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:09,438
I was hoping to pick up clues on the killer.

366
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:12,738
At this rate, Mr. Tendo wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

367
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,038
Next Conan,

368
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,138
"The Comedian Who Turned Himself In (Part 2)"

369
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,838
Next Conan's Hint

370
00:24:39,838 --> 00:24:42,138
"Pocket Tissue".

371
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:44,538
Hey, Conan! A character called Dodonpa was on Oba-Q, right?

372
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,038
His name was Doronpa. This one is Dodonpa!
