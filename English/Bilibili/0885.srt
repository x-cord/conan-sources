1
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.210
"Mouri Detective Agency" -This is crazy.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.910
It's so pretty.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.510
Isn't it?

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.110
Heiji and I are on our way now to check out the lights.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.310
What?

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.110
Now?

7
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.010
Aren't these lights at Tokyo's Kinza Block 4?

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.510
Yeah, so we thought we'd invite you.

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.710
We're here.

10
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.310
You actually came?

11
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.210
Yeah. We're busy at the end of the year.

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.710
Today's the only day we were free.

13
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.610
And you said you weren't busy this weekend.

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.010
Well, yeah.

15
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.610
I guess not.

16
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.510
But I just got back from grocery shopping.

17
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.210
I haven't made dinner yet.

18
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.710
Dad said he'd be home around seven,

19
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.310
so I need to start cooking.

20
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.710
Then I'll help you.

21
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.710
Let's whip something up

22
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.410
and go have dinner while we look at the lights.

23
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.610
What?

24
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.310
Come on!

25
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.410
Okay.

26
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.510
Don't worry about paying for dinner.

27
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.710
We brought meal tickets to a cafe in Kinza.

28
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.310
You boys have fun at Poirot downstairs.

29
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.510
Sure.

30
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.610
Hey, Kudo.

31
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.210
If you're planning on asking why we came...

32
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.810
I'm not.

33
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.710
I already know.

34
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.410
Fine, then.

35
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

36
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.410
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

37
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.910
I wish I could give Hattori my support,

38
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.910
but a strange customer arrives at Cafe Poirot.

39
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.610
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.510
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.010
His name is Detective Conan!

42
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:52.909
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 1)"

43
00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:53.809
"Mouri Detective Agency"

44
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.309
I'm surprised Hattori agreed

45
00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.209
to go to such a romantic place.

46
00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.209
I was surprised, too.

47
00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.509
I expected him to say something like "Don't be stupid".

48
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.909
Wow, it's so pretty!

49
00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.009
Apparently they're the lights at Kinza Block 4.

50
00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.209
It must be crazy in person.

51
00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.409
Wanna go, then?

52
00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.509
What?

53
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.209
My mom won some tickets to a cafe in Kinza in a lottery.

54
00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:24.909
She said she wasn't sure what to do with them

55
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.509
since she didn't have time to go.

56
00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.309
Do I...

57
00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.009
sense romance in the air?

58
00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.209
There you go again.

59
00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.409
You always think there's love in the air, Ran.

60
00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:44.309
Huh? This meat and potatoes don't taste like anything.

61
00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:46.409
-What? -Oh, no.

62
00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:48.609
We forgot to put the soy sauce in.

63
00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:49.709
No way.

64
00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:51.509
What are we going to do?

65
00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.509
We've already boiled it quite a bit.

66
00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.209
The ingredients will turn to sludge before they absorb the flavor.

67
00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.109
Let's make curry instead.

68
00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:03.009
Yeah.

69
00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:09.609
Who comes all the way to Tokyo for that?

70
00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:11.609
Shut up, idiot.

71
00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:13.909
You went all the way to London

72
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.909
to tell her how you feel.

73
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.909
In my case...

74
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:20.409
What an idiot.

75
00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.409
What?

76
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.509
You mean you can't tell?

77
00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.809
Aren't you a detective?

78
00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.509
A detective should be able to deduce how I feel!

79
00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.109
You idiot!

80
00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:34.709
Hey! Wait, Ran!

81
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.109
Hey!

82
00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:39.509
No! Let go!

83
00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.109
You're a tough one.

84
00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:43.309
What?

85
00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.709
You're like a tough case.

86
00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:49.209
There's all these distracting emotions.

87
00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:53.209
Even if I were Holmes, it'd still be impossible to solve.

88
00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.609
It's impossible

89
00:05:55.609 --> 00:05:58.609
to accurately read the heart of the girl I love.

90
00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.709
We just happened to be in London.

91
00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:09.509
Oh, yeah? I'd like to say a line as cool as that.

92
00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.309
Anyway, are you sure about today?

93
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:13.409
Huh?

94
00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.509
The date.

95
00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.809
Yeah.

96
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.809
After all, today is...

97
00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:20.709
Friday the 13th.

98
00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.109
Is that why?

99
00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:26.109
There are various theories

100
00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:29.709
on why it's considered an unlucky day.

101
00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:31.809
The most common ones

102
00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:34.009
are because Jesus Christ's last supper

103
00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.609
was attended by 13 people,

104
00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:39.309
or because the number 13 doesn't fit

105
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.709
in the duodecimal system.

106
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:45.709
And Jesus was crucified on a Friday.

107
00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:50.009
President Kennedy was also assassinated in Dallas

108
00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.209
on a Friday, wasn't he?

109
00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.209
But we're in Japan.

110
00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.209
You have nothing to worry about.

111
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:04.609
The 13th day of the month

112
00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:07.309
just happened to be a Friday.

113
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:10.809
Statistically speaking, it happens twice a year.

114
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.209
You shouldn't worry about

115
00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:15.909
telling the object of your affection how you feel.

116
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.709
Besides, Jesus and Kennedy didn't die on the 13th.

117
00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:23.809
But on Friday the 13th...

118
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:27.609
On the Friday of October 13th, 1307,

119
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:29.309
King Philip IV

120
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.509
had all the Knights Templar in France arrested.

121
00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.809
They were unjustly tortured and burned at the stake.

122
00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:41.709
On the Friday of June 13th, 1483,

123
00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:43.909
the notorious Richard III

124
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:47.209
had one of his advisors executed for treason.

125
00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:52.109
Julius Caesar was also betrayed and murdered by Brutus

126
00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:54.409
on Friday the 13th.

127
00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:58.109
"Customer" -Today is a very unlucky day.

128
00:07:58.109 --> 00:08:01.109
Even in Japan, it should be avoided.

129
00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:05.709
Excuse me.

130
00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:08.809
I happened to overhear your conversation and couldn't help myself.

131
00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:12.709
Who is this guy?

132
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:14.809
I didn't notice him at all.

133
00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:20.109
Hey, does he come here often?

134
00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:22.509
No, I think it's his first time here.

135
00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:26.209
He came in right after you did.

136
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:29.609
Welcome.

137
00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.309
"Meisuke Ozumi (21), Beika University Third-Year" -What?

138
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:33.409
They're still not here?

139
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.509
Fine, then.

140
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.709
You're with the Beika University drama club

141
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:40.409
that made a reservation, correct?

142
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.109
Your friends aren't here yet.

143
00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:43.409
Seriously.

144
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.109
We're celebrating Yui's birthday here today.

145
00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.309
"Reserved"

146
00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:49.509
When they show up,

147
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:52.109
tell them they can start without me.

148
00:08:52.109 --> 00:08:53.909
Okay.

149
00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:56.709
My stomach hasn't been feeling well since this afternoon.

150
00:08:56.709 --> 00:08:58.409
Are you all right?

151
00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:00.109
I'm fine.

152
00:09:01.109 --> 00:09:02.509
"Reserved"

153
00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.909
"Coffee Poirot"

154
00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:08.309
Seriously?

155
00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:11.609
Don't tell me we got here first.

156
00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:12.709
No.

157
00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:15.909
Mr. Ozumi arrived earlier.

158
00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:18.509
He's in the bathroom.

159
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:19.509
Really?

160
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:23.909
Ozumi didn't seem well this afternoon.

161
00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:27.809
Then I have you to myself while your boyfriend's gone.

162
00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:29.409
Stop that.

163
00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:33.209
"Yui Yamashita (21)" -Tengo, I'm telling you just in case,

164
00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:36.209
"Beika University Third-Year" -but don't say anything about that.

165
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.409
"Tengo Anzai (20), Beika University Third-Year" -Who knows?

166
00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:41.209
I might let something slip once I start to drink.

167
00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:44.909
They don't serve alcohol here.

168
00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:46.809
What? Really?

169
00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:51.409
Nagatsuka's still not here.

170
00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:55.309
Yeah. He's in the middle of filming

171
00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:58.309
your birthday video right now.

172
00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:00.609
After all, he's in love with you.

173
00:10:00.609 --> 00:10:02.209
Nagatsuka is?

174
00:10:02.209 --> 00:10:03.609
Yeah, right.

175
00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:07.509
He always glares at me

176
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:10.909
when I flirt with you.

177
00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:15.709
He's just upset that you're flirting with his friend's girlfriend.

178
00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:18.209
Ozumi and Nagatsuka

179
00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:21.309
went to the same high school.

180
00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:24.109
You and I are just childhood friends.

181
00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:26.009
We're just messing around.

182
00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:29.109
Just friends, huh?

183
00:10:30.109 --> 00:10:34.009
Either way, they'll find out soon enough.

184
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.509
What do you mean?

185
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:39.809
Nothing, my childhood friend, Yui.

186
00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:40.609
I...

187
00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:42.309
"Minoru Nagatsuka (20)" -I thought you were just...

188
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:43.309
"Beika University Third-Year" -childhood friends.

189
00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:45.809
Nagatsuka.

190
00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:48.309
Hey, you're late.

191
00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:51.209
I got lost.

192
00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:53.009
Lost?

193
00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:55.609
We've been here plenty of times before

194
00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:56.709
while hunting for locations.

195
00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:58.209
Have we?

196
00:10:58.209 --> 00:11:02.209
Last year we put on a play based on this location.

197
00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:04.809
We came here together then.

198
00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:06.209
Our previous club president

199
00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:09.709
suggested we build a set identical to this place.

200
00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:14.109
We even measured the size of the tables and the height of the chairs.

201
00:11:14.109 --> 00:11:15.609
Right, mister?

202
00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:17.009
You remember, right?

203
00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:22.209
I wasn't working here then.

204
00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:24.509
Azusa, do you remember?

205
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:25.609
Yes.

206
00:11:25.609 --> 00:11:29.209
I was asked about how we interact with customers

207
00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:31.209
and serve dishes.

208
00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:33.309
Have a seat.

209
00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:37.109
Let's watch Yui's birthday video together.

210
00:11:37.109 --> 00:11:39.009
You finished filming your part, right?

211
00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:43.009
Yeah. I just sent it to your laptop.

212
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:44.109
Oh, yeah?

213
00:11:44.109 --> 00:11:46.909
But Ozumi's not here yet.

214
00:11:46.909 --> 00:11:50.409
He's in the bathroom.

215
00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:53.209
Oh, we're going to make some noise.

216
00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:54.709
Don't mind us.

217
00:11:59.109 --> 00:12:01.109
It's not turning on.

218
00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:03.309
Is the battery dead?

219
00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:04.709
Hey, miss.

220
00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:06.309
Could we borrow an outlet?

221
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.809
Sure.

222
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:12.009
Here you go.

223
00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:13.009
Thanks.

224
00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:20.209
No way. A blackout?

225
00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:23.509
I... I just saw a spark.

226
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.809
Yeah, from the outlet.

227
00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:28.009
Azusa, check the breaker.

228
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:29.009
Okay.

229
00:12:35.109 --> 00:12:36.109
What?

230
00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:37.809
Azusa, hurry.

231
00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:38.809
Okay.

232
00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:46.909
What's all this noise about?

233
00:13:03.476 --> 00:13:05.276
No way. A blackout?

234
00:13:05.276 --> 00:13:08.376
I... I just saw a spark.

235
00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:10.976
Yeah, from the outlet.

236
00:13:10.976 --> 00:13:13.176
Azusa, check the breaker.

237
00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:14.176
Okay.

238
00:13:20.276 --> 00:13:21.276
What?

239
00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:22.876
Azusa, hurry.

240
00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:23.876
Okay.

241
00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.976
What's all this noise about?

242
00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:39.776
Tengo! Hang in there, Tengo!

243
00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:41.976
-Don't! -Don't touch him!

244
00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.376
What?

245
00:13:43.376 --> 00:13:45.276
This is a murder.

246
00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:48.076
Don't carelessly damage the crime scene.

247
00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:57.676
Looks like this is attempted murder.

248
00:13:57.676 --> 00:14:01.176
Azusa, call an ambulance and the police.

249
00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:02.576
Got it.

250
00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:07.176
Since he was stabbed with such a long sashimi knife,

251
00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:09.476
I thought he'd died instantly.

252
00:14:09.476 --> 00:14:11.976
But there's no need to call the police.

253
00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:16.676
When he was stabbed, some blood flew onto my face.

254
00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:19.276
And onto my glasses, too.

255
00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:23.076
His blood must've gotten

256
00:14:23.076 --> 00:14:26.376
on the culprit's hands or sleeves.

257
00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:28.276
"Coffee Poirot"

258
00:14:28.276 --> 00:14:29.676
You can't be serious.

259
00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:37.776
Why isn't there any blood on anyone?

260
00:14:39.176 --> 00:14:42.876
You, sir. The man quietly trying to leave.

261
00:14:42.876 --> 00:14:45.276
Could you show us your hands?

262
00:14:46.276 --> 00:14:50.776
No, I wasn't trying to leave.

263
00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:54.276
There's no blood on him either.

264
00:14:54.276 --> 00:14:55.276
Again?

265
00:14:56.276 --> 00:15:00.376
Gosh. Why does every case have to be so hard?

266
00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:01.876
Seriously, Hattori.

267
00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:04.276
Are you sure you're not cursed?

268
00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:06.576
"Mouri Detective Agency"

269
00:15:07.376 --> 00:15:09.976
What? Don't come to Poirot?

270
00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:11.176
Why not?

271
00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:13.676
We just finished making the old man's dinner

272
00:15:13.676 --> 00:15:15.476
and are on our way.

273
00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:19.476
There was actually a murder...

274
00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:22.976
It must be crazy in person.

275
00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:25.876
They're filming.

276
00:15:25.876 --> 00:15:27.876
They're filming for a movie.

277
00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:29.876
Really? I wanna see it.

278
00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:32.176
You idiot! You'd better not come!

279
00:15:32.176 --> 00:15:34.576
It's a super scary horror movie!

280
00:15:34.576 --> 00:15:36.276
What?

281
00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:38.676
We'll meet you once we're finished here.

282
00:15:38.676 --> 00:15:40.576
You guys go ahead without us.

283
00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:42.076
Okay...

284
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.276
We're leaving without them?

285
00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:48.076
They said they'd come later.

286
00:15:48.076 --> 00:15:49.876
An ambulance?

287
00:15:49.876 --> 00:15:52.376
Is it a hospital movie?

288
00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:53.576
Let's go.

289
00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:55.376
I'm excited to see the lights.

290
00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:56.376
Yeah.

291
00:15:56.376 --> 00:15:57.476
"Coffee Poirot"

292
00:15:57.476 --> 00:15:59.076
I see.

293
00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:04.876
Due to the thin wire wrapped around the plug

294
00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:07.776
powering victim Tengo Anzai's laptop,

295
00:16:07.776 --> 00:16:12.276
when the victim plugged it into this extension cord,

296
00:16:12.276 --> 00:16:14.176
it shorted out and caused a blackout.

297
00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:19.076
And in the darkness, someone inside the store stabbed the victim.

298
00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:21.276
Yes, most likely.

299
00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:25.576
But there's no blood on the hands or sleeves

300
00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:29.976
of the victim's three friends or the other customer.

301
00:16:29.976 --> 00:16:34.076
There's none on Conan and Hattori,

302
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.976
who were also inside the cafe, or employees Amuro and Azusa.

303
00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:40.276
All of this despite the fact that Conan and Hattori

304
00:16:40.276 --> 00:16:42.276
got blood on their faces,

305
00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:43.976
and the table they were sitting at

306
00:16:43.976 --> 00:16:47.376
was splattered with blood.

307
00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:53.276
Did the victim always carry this laptop with him?

308
00:16:53.276 --> 00:16:54.576
Yes.

309
00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:58.176
He kept it in that bag on the floor.

310
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:02.076
But he left it in the club room all the time.

311
00:17:02.076 --> 00:17:04.176
Anyone could've done something to it.

312
00:17:04.176 --> 00:17:07.476
Yeah. He had a lot of enemies.

313
00:17:07.476 --> 00:17:08.776
-Enemies? -Enemies?

314
00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:13.276
He frequently flirted with other men's girlfriends and caused trouble.

315
00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:17.676
He even flirted with my girlfriend, Yui.

316
00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:20.976
It's because we're childhood friends.

317
00:17:20.976 --> 00:17:23.376
I told you he was just messing around.

318
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.876
His dad's a member of the Diet.

319
00:17:26.876 --> 00:17:29.176
I heard he smoothed over

320
00:17:29.176 --> 00:17:32.076
a lot of disputes for him behind the scenes.

321
00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.676
I see.

322
00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:37.376
By the way, the victim seems to have been sitting

323
00:17:37.376 --> 00:17:40.276
in this seat before the blackout occurred.

324
00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:42.976
Where was everyone else sitting then?

325
00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:47.276
I... I was sitting across from him

326
00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:49.676
in the booth.

327
00:17:49.676 --> 00:17:53.976
I was sitting next to Anzai in that chair.

328
00:17:53.976 --> 00:17:55.376
-I see. -I see.

329
00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:57.476
What about you, Mr. Ozumi?

330
00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:00.876
I arrived before the others.

331
00:18:00.876 --> 00:18:03.176
After setting my bag in the booth,

332
00:18:03.176 --> 00:18:05.676
I was in the bathroom the whole time.

333
00:18:05.676 --> 00:18:08.576
My stomach hasn't been feeling well since this afternoon.

334
00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:11.076
I see. In the bathroom.

335
00:18:11.076 --> 00:18:14.276
That makes you the only one who could've

336
00:18:14.276 --> 00:18:16.676
washed the blood off.

337
00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:20.376
If you think I did it, you can search me!

338
00:18:20.376 --> 00:18:22.576
Even if I washed it off with water,

339
00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:25.376
there'd still be a something-or-other reaction, right?

340
00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:27.676
Luminol.

341
00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:31.376
It's used to detect nitrogen-containing compounds.

342
00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:35.076
When mixed with hydrogen peroxide

343
00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:39.076
and sprayed onto blood, it reflects a pale light.

344
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:44.276
I doubt Mr. Ozumi will produce a luminol reaction.

345
00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:46.476
Before the police arrived,

346
00:18:46.476 --> 00:18:50.876
I checked the security camera footage.

347
00:18:50.876 --> 00:18:54.876
He came to Poirot first and went into the bathroom.

348
00:18:54.876 --> 00:18:58.476
Mr. Anzai and Ms. Yamashita arrived next.

349
00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:01.476
Finally, Mr. Nagatsuka arrived sometime later.

350
00:19:01.476 --> 00:19:02.776
The blackout occurred

351
00:19:02.776 --> 00:19:05.076
when they tried to watch the birthday video

352
00:19:05.076 --> 00:19:07.376
on the laptop.

353
00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:09.876
Until the footage cut off due to the blackout,

354
00:19:09.876 --> 00:19:12.876
the bathroom door remained closed the whole time.

355
00:19:13.676 --> 00:19:17.976
I doubt he could've known who was sitting where.

356
00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:22.276
But the bathroom has a peephole.

357
00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:24.676
Oh, this?

358
00:19:24.676 --> 00:19:26.976
The glass is frosted.

359
00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:29.876
You can't see what's going on in the store.

360
00:19:29.876 --> 00:19:31.576
Let me see.

361
00:19:31.576 --> 00:19:33.176
You're right.

362
00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:34.376
Hey, Kudo.

363
00:19:34.376 --> 00:19:36.676
Who is that guy?

364
00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.476
He's no ordinary cafe worker, is he?

365
00:19:39.476 --> 00:19:41.576
Oh, he's...

366
00:19:44.276 --> 00:19:47.276
Who is he?

367
00:19:48.576 --> 00:19:51.176
He's a detective.

368
00:19:51.176 --> 00:19:54.076
He was the old man's apprentice.

369
00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:57.176
Seriously? That idiot's apprentice?

370
00:19:57.176 --> 00:19:58.476
Then he's good for nothing.

371
00:20:01.776 --> 00:20:02.876
My goodness.

372
00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:03.876
"There's curry in the pot." -Seriously?

373
00:20:03.876 --> 00:20:04.876
"We'll be back before 9 pm. Ran."

374
00:20:04.876 --> 00:20:08.076
I'm exhausted from looking into an affair,

375
00:20:08.076 --> 00:20:10.676
there's police cars parked outside Poirot,

376
00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.876
and Ran's not home.

377
00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:16.576
Who puts shirataki in curry, anyway?

378
00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:24.076
That's pretty good, though.

379
00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:29.276
Inspector.

380
00:20:30.276 --> 00:20:34.176
I examined the possessions of those three.

381
00:20:34.176 --> 00:20:36.776
Mr. Ozumi had

382
00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:39.476
keys, cigarettes, a lighter,

383
00:20:39.476 --> 00:20:43.276
a wallet, a phone, and a present for Ms. Yui,

384
00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:45.276
which contained a necklace.

385
00:20:45.276 --> 00:20:49.376
Ms. Yui Yamashita had a handkerchief, tissues,

386
00:20:49.376 --> 00:20:52.276
makeup, keys, and a wallet.

387
00:20:52.276 --> 00:20:56.676
Mr. Nagatsuka had eye drops, a wallet, a phone,

388
00:20:56.676 --> 00:21:00.776
and a present for Ms. Yui containing gloves.

389
00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:04.476
I searched Mr. Ozumi's bag as well,

390
00:21:04.476 --> 00:21:07.376
but didn't find anything he could've used to commit a crime.

391
00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:08.976
I see.

392
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:13.176
Listen, detectives, you seem to think we did it.

393
00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:15.876
Couldn't it have been an outsider?

394
00:21:15.876 --> 00:21:18.876
Maybe someone was waiting outside the store for the blackout,

395
00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:22.276
and came inside to stab him with night vision goggles?

396
00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:23.876
That seems unlikely.

397
00:21:28.076 --> 00:21:30.576
Why do you say that?

398
00:21:30.576 --> 00:21:34.376
Immediately after that man was stabbed and screamed,

399
00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:37.876
I stood in front of the entrance

400
00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:42.376
so no one could get out.

401
00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:43.576
Really?

402
00:21:43.576 --> 00:21:45.776
That's why you were standing next to the door

403
00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:48.876
when the lights came on.

404
00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:50.476
Yes.

405
00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:53.376
You must have pretty good night vision.

406
00:21:53.376 --> 00:21:54.476
No.

407
00:21:54.476 --> 00:21:57.276
I just happened to be using my phone to...

408
00:21:57.276 --> 00:22:00.076
listen to music.

409
00:22:00.076 --> 00:22:02.776
I used that faint light.

410
00:22:02.776 --> 00:22:05.076
Music?

411
00:22:05.076 --> 00:22:06.776
Come to think of it,

412
00:22:06.776 --> 00:22:09.576
you haven't told us your name yet.

413
00:22:09.576 --> 00:22:11.676
My name?

414
00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:13.776
I'm Shinichi Wada.

415
00:22:13.776 --> 00:22:15.376
I work in medicine.

416
00:22:16.876 --> 00:22:18.976
I see...

417
00:22:18.976 --> 00:22:21.976
So I'm curious why

418
00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:26.376
no one has any blood on them.

419
00:22:26.376 --> 00:22:29.276
Shinichi Wada?

420
00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:56.976
"Next Episode" -There's no blood on anyone.

421
00:23:56.976 --> 00:24:00.176
I didn't know who was sitting where either.

422
00:24:00.176 --> 00:24:04.276
I thought of a trick to avoid getting blood on yourself, but...

423
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:08.676
"From between long clouds blown by the fall wind..."

424
00:24:08.676 --> 00:24:10.676
Where did that come from?

425
00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:13.176
One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets?

426
00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:15.376
So that's how it is.

427
00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:18.076
I know exactly what happened.

428
00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:20.776
Next Conan,

429
00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:24.376
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 2)"

430
00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:27.019
Next Conan's hint:

431
00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:29.419
"Toilet Paper"

432
00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:31.119
A detective's apprentice and medical worker?

433
00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:32.119
Who are these dudes?

434
00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:34.219
There sure are a lot of detectives around.
