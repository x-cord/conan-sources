1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,140
We leave on Dr. Agasa's car to go camping,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,740
but we run out of gas and are stalled.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,940
We seek help from Mr. Goki Sudo

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,540
who happens to pass by in a classic car,

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,440
but he makes a rude remark and goes off.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,340
Soon afterwards,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,740
an explosion occurs at the villa at the top of the mountain.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,640
When I ran over there,

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
I saw Mr. Sudo's classic car up in flames

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,640
and his fiance, Ena Ginbayashi, shouting his name

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,940
and breaking out in tears.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,240
At first, it looked to be a very unfortunate accident.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,740
But I was suspicious of Ena's attitude.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,440
Could it be a murder that Ena set up?

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,040
No igniting device was found at the site,

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,640
but there's got to be something!

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,740
A trick that can be used

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,540
to set the garage on fire without using an igniting device.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,940
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,440
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,040
An explosion occurs where there is nothing to start a fire.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,140
The secret behind a trick filled with hate.

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,640
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:58,854
"Blue Sparks of Hate (Part 2)".

27
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,554
Then, well, leaving the cigarettes aside.

28
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:14,054
"Ena Ginbayashi (31), Sudo's fiance" -Let's hear where and what

29
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:17,854
all of you were doing when Mr. Sudo came to this villa?

30
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,654
What?

31
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:23,154
We were all gathered in the room playing a game.

32
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:24,354
Game?

33
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:26,654
King game!

34
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:27,854
You don't know that game?

35
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:31,054
You make pieces of paper with the seal of a King and a number on it.

36
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:33,454
The person who draws the paper with the King on it

37
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:37,154
has certain commands written on it like "number 13 kiss number 4".

38
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:40,554
Was there anyone that wasn't in this room

39
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,954
when Mr. Sudo came here?

40
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:44,554
I think everybody was here.

41
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,154
If anyone went to the restroom,

42
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,554
we stopped the game

43
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:49,954
and waited for that person to come back.

44
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:53,454
But if the owner of the house Mr. Sudo got here,

45
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:56,454
it's only natural that someone would go out to greet him, right?

46
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:59,754
No, we didn't realize that he came back.

47
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:03,754
The garage door opens by remote controller from inside the car.

48
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,854
We had the BGM on pretty loud too.

49
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,354
Then we heard a big boom

50
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,354
and went to look outside.

51
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,554
And found that the garage was on fire.

52
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,854
Which means that even if there were to be an igniting device,

53
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:20,254
nobody could've operated it

54
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:23,654
or calculate the timing to set it off?

55
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:24,654
No.

56
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,154
Not possible.

57
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:31,354
But why was the poly tank so unfortunately knocked over?

58
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,054
I think it was him.

59
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:38,654
This golden retriever that my late father bought for me.

60
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,854
She so mischievous

61
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:42,554
and has a habit of knocking things over.

62
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:47,254
That's why I told him not to store gasoline in a poly tank.

63
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:52,154
But I didn't think that the same thing would happen three times.

64
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,654
Did something like this happen before too?

65
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:57,954
Yeah, we had a party last week and the previous week too,

66
00:04:57,954 --> 00:04:59,354
but when Sudo came,

67
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:01,554
the poly tank was knocked over.

68
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:05,754
He was really angry saying, "Who the hell did this?"

69
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:08,254
After he found out that Ena's dog did it,

70
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:10,054
he got in a big fight with Ena too.

71
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:16,054
They fought over everything from Sudo's car, to clothes...

72
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,654
So, the party was finished right then and there.

73
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,154
Was that two weeks ago?

74
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,654
Yes, last week

75
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:26,354
I think they fought over Sudo stopping by somewhere before coming here.

76
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:28,854
Who cares about something like that already!

77
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,154
Sorry.

78
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:34,854
He died because

79
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:39,354
he didn't listen to me.

80
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:45,654
It all adds up to that's only how much he cared for me.

81
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,454
That's all there is to it.

82
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:51,154
There!

83
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:55,154
It's a tank of gasoline I had one of the men bring.

84
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,754
Thanks so much!

85
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:59,154
So, if there's anything more I want to ask you,

86
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:00,554
I'll call you.

87
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:01,654
Okay.

88
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,954
That boy wearing glasses is nowhere around.

89
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,654
He's over there!

90
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:11,054
Please tell me!

91
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,554
About the fight the two had last week and the week before!

92
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:17,254
I mean, talk about persistent! I already told you!

93
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:20,254
The week before last they got into a fight over the car and clothes.

94
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,854
But what made them fight over something like that?

95
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,554
Beats me,

96
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:28,754
probably because Ena told Sudo to come with his classic car,

97
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,954
but he showed up with a new model car?

98
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:34,554
Or, maybe because Goki didn't come to the party

99
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:37,354
with the clothes that Ena bought for him just for the party?

100
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,254
What kind of clothes was it?

101
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,954
What kind?

102
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:44,154
Remember, when you ran into Goki a while ago,

103
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,954
I think he was wearing it too,

104
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:48,654
a white wool sweater and a fleece jacket.

105
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:51,854
The sweater's the one that Ena bought for him.

106
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:54,554
Sudo wore the fleece ever since he established his company,

107
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,654
because he really liked it,

108
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,554
but he didn't like wool.

109
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:01,054
But last week,

110
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,254
when he came here, he was wearing the wool sweater, right?

111
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,154
He was also riding the classic car.

112
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:09,754
But when she saw that Goki was holding a PET bottle of mineral water

113
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:12,454
Ena got angry saying,

114
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:14,954
"How dare you dilly-dally at a convenience store

115
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:17,154
despite knowing everyone is waiting!"

116
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:18,154
Goki was seriously angry saying,

117
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:21,054
"It's nobody's business where I stop over!"

118
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,754
Then, the wine that Ena was holding

119
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:25,954
splattered onto Goki's sweater.

120
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,054
And Ena started apologizing and crying

121
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:31,154
saying that she'd buy him a new one,

122
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,054
so the party kind of drained away last week too.

123
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,354
But it's strange.

124
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:40,754
Ena used to say before that she hated classic cars and yet...

125
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,354
The classic car, a wool sweater.

126
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:47,954
Stopping over...

127
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,954
Wait a sec, this is...

128
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:53,454
The investigation's over.

129
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:00,454
So, leave the rest up to the police

130
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:02,454
and go enjoy camping.

131
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,754
Yes, sir.

132
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,354
See you.

133
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,754
Enjoy? No way.

134
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,154
Because we're concerned about the incident.

135
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,454
So we can't possibly enjoy ourselves.

136
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,654
Hey, Shinichi. Can't you solve the case yet?

137
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:20,954
No, I know I'm almost there, but...

138
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:23,754
I don't care what,

139
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,354
but why don't we talk after getting in the car?

140
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,454
I guess so.

141
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:29,054
Besides, it's getting a bit chilly too.

142
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:33,254
Boy, go ahead and get in the car then!

143
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,854
I hate to say this, but open the door for me then.

144
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:39,354
You'd better cut it, girl!

145
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:40,954
Just who the hell do you think you are?

146
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,554
Open the door! Please...

147
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:48,154
Don't tell me that you're...

148
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:51,654
Please.

149
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:01,554
Okay, I'll teach you a good way then!

150
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:02,854
If it's before you get in the car,

151
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,654
touch the asphalt pavement,

152
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,854
and if it's the door knob, touch the wall.

153
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,354
I didn't ask you that question, did I?

154
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,754
I'm telling you to open the door for me!

155
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:14,254
Try it.

156
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,354
While you're at it,

157
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,254
maybe opening your hands wide like this...

158
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:21,954
Opening your hands wide?

159
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:23,754
You mean, stone, paper, scissors?

160
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:26,554
I see. That's why...

161
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,654
it's the classic car.

162
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:33,354
That's why Ena

163
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,754
didn't want him to stop by anywhere.

164
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:41,954
She had schemed to make Mr. Sudo himself

165
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:44,054
the ignition device!

166
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:47,554
The police officer said just a while ago too!

167
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,254
That the gasoline poly tank

168
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,554
that happened to be in the garage was knocked over

169
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:54,754
and the gasoline vaporized, filling the garage.

170
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,954
And when Sudo got out of the car,

171
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:58,654
holding a cigarette in his mouth

172
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,354
in the garage filled with evaporated gasoline,

173
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:02,354
it caught fire and exploded, right?

174
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,454
It's obviously an accident!

175
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:08,254
And yet, why do we have to continue being interrogated further?

176
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:11,754
No, the person that the police wants to interrogate

177
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:15,654
is you, Mr. Goki Sudo's fiance,

178
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:19,854
only you, Ms. Ena Ginbayashi!

179
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:23,554
The thing about the poly tank with the gasoline inside being knocked over

180
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:25,354
for three weeks straight

181
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:28,454
really seems to bug this boy and he wants to ask you questions.

182
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:30,654
He won't take no for an answer.

183
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:33,354
Not this brat again!

184
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:34,954
What is it with you?

185
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:38,854
I just told the Inspector to ask her a small question.

186
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,154
It may be that someone

187
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,754
deliberately knocked the poly tank over after all.

188
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:48,154
Well, I just want to ask you a bit more things.

189
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:51,554
I guess I've got no choice.

190
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:54,254
I've got to go to the police and tell them

191
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,754
that there're no bad people like that here.

192
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:00,754
But I don't want to take the police car.

193
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,154
It's like I'm being arrested or something,

194
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,454
so I'll take my car.

195
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:05,954
Oh, right!

196
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:08,454
Since we're the last ones who saw Mr. Sudo,

197
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:11,254
we're also being summoned by the police.

198
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,654
So, why don't we all go in our car?

199
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,954
Okay.

200
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:21,754
You came with quite a number of people, didn't you?

201
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,554
I wonder if I can ride together?

202
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:27,054
It'll be fine! Don't worry about them.

203
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,354
They're all absorbed in that car over there, so...

204
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:32,654
Are you really letting us ride a police car?

205
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:34,254
I'm honored!

206
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,754
But I guess not, after all.

207
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:40,854
I'll take my car.

208
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:43,754
Oh, that's too bad.

209
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:46,654
I had something I wanted to show you.

210
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,954
Something you want me to see?

211
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:53,554
Yep! I picked it up on my way here to the villa.

212
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,154
It belongs to Mr. Sudo.

213
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:58,454
I haven't shown the police officers it yet either.

214
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,254
Don't you want to see it?

215
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,554
Yes, well, sort of.

216
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:18,446
How do you like this car?

217
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,746
Pretty good, don't you think?

218
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:22,446
Well, to say nothing of comfortable riding,

219
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,246
the shape is cute.

220
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,846
What's this car called?

221
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,546
It's called the Beetle,

222
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,346
because it looks like the insect.

223
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,846
Come to think of it, it does look similar.

224
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:36,446
Oh, mail?

225
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,546
Yep, to my friend!

226
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:41,546
Because we're finally in the cell phone service range area.

227
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,946
After you finish mailing,

228
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,746
will you show it to me?

229
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:48,646
His thing that you say you picked up.

230
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:49,846
Okay.

231
00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:54,246
This!

232
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:58,346
This is the emblem of Goki's car.

233
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:00,446
Do you know about it?

234
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,446
Yes.

235
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:08,446
It was on the nose of Goki's classic car.

236
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:11,246
Are you sure it's really from his car?

237
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,046
Yep, after the explosion,

238
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:18,046
it was found on the road below the villa, after it came flying to us.

239
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,746
But...

240
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:28,746
you don't like classic cars, right?

241
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:36,746
If so, why did you ask Mr. Sudo to come in that car?

242
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,446
I... I began to like it

243
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:41,146
after being influenced by him.

244
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:45,046
Besides, it seems that Mr. Sudo didn't like wool

245
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:48,346
and yet why did you make him wear a wool sweater before coming here?

246
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:51,746
Because... because I thought he'd look good in it.

247
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:55,446
All he ever used to wear was fleece, so...

248
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:57,346
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:57,346 --> 00:14:00,746
you're wearing a wool sweater and fleece jacket today too, aren't you, Ai?

250
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,946
So, what?

251
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:06,946
Well, I just thought I'd ask.

252
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:11,246
Then, this is the only thing that you picked up, Sonny?

253
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:13,346
Yep, that's right.

254
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:16,346
Did you think it was something else?

255
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:18,446
No, not really.

256
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,746
Out of gas again.

257
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:24,546
Oh, boy. The officer just brought you

258
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:26,046
some gasoline to put into your car just a while ago and yet...

259
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,246
What now?

260
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:33,146
There aren't any service stations around here, either.

261
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:35,346
Then, why don't we go to your house to get some?

262
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:37,946
You had a can of gasoline in your garage, didn't you?

263
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,046
Oh, that's right!

264
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,346
There are some that I bought in order to go camping

265
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:43,646
and forgot to load in car.

266
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:47,446
Sorry, but I hope you don't mind us stopping by at Doc's house.

267
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:48,746
Sure.

268
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,746
I'm sorry. One moment, please.

269
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,046
There it is!

270
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:10,646
This is it.

271
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:23,346
Just what do you think you're doing?

272
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:30,246
The gasoline tank being knocked down in the garage

273
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:34,346
is just like the garage of the villa that caught fire just a while ago.

274
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:35,346
Yes.

275
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:36,946
But we'll be fine

276
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,246
because there's nobody who smokes here.

277
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:41,046
I... I see.

278
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:42,846
I'm sorry, Ai,

279
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:46,146
but could you get me the towel that's in the trunk?

280
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,446
You can open it with the car key.

281
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,846
Gosh, he is so hopeless.

282
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:52,846
Hey...

283
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:57,346
No!

284
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,446
No! Don't put the key inside!

285
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:07,246
Static will cause sparks of fire!

286
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:21,946
So, static was the ignition device after all.

287
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:27,646
Your remark just now cleared everything.

288
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:31,246
You made Mr. Sudo wear a combination of clothes

289
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:34,046
that would accumulate a lot of static fleece and wool.

290
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:38,346
You also made him come a long way by car to that villa garage

291
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:41,046
that was filled with evaporated gasoline.

292
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:42,946
When Mr. Sudo got off the car,

293
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,546
the moment he inserted the key into the keyhole

294
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,246
in order to lock the door,

295
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:49,646
static caused sparks of fire which ignited the gasoline...

296
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:58,046
and that was the set up that burned him to death.

297
00:16:58,046 --> 00:16:59,546
When you're driving,

298
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:04,746
your back rubs against the seat, causing static to build up.

299
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:09,146
Moreover, the motive of why you had him come with his classic car

300
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:12,946
is because recent cars are usually equipped with keyless remote controllers

301
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:14,546
that when you lock the door,

302
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:17,446
you don't need to insert the key into the keyhole.

303
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:21,246
In other words, you don't have to touch overcharged static

304
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:24,546
caused by metal against metal.

305
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:29,546
But there are times that static causes only a prickly feeling, right?

306
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:31,946
I wonder if it would give off sparks of fire so conveniently.

307
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:35,546
It's true that just once won't do it,

308
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:38,746
but if you were planning to do it until sparks of fire would occur one day,

309
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:40,346
you're sure to succeed someday!

310
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,946
You seem to have actually tried it

311
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,346
three weeks in a row already, right?

312
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,746
The week before last, static didn't occur

313
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:53,846
because Mr. Sudo wasn't wearing a wool sweater

314
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:55,846
and came with a new model car.

315
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:57,846
Last week, you didn't succeed because Mr. Sudo stopped over

316
00:17:57,846 --> 00:18:01,446
at the convenience store to buy a drink.

317
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,446
Once you get out of the car and touch something,

318
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:07,646
the static that built up until then flows out.

319
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:10,846
So, even if you put the key in the keyhole of the car,

320
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:13,646
it wouldn't be enough to create sparks of fire.

321
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:18,446
And then you got into a fight and soiled his sweater with wine

322
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:22,146
in order make him take off his sweater as soon as possible.

323
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,146
Because if he keeps wearing the sweater and static builds up,

324
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,546
you didn't want him to go out

325
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:32,146
and buy static proofclothes.

326
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:35,046
Of course you didn't want Mr. Sudo to discuss with anybody

327
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:38,346
about how to become static proof.

328
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:40,046
Yes, like for example,

329
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:43,346
before getting off the car and touching the ground with your feet,

330
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,946
place your hand on the roof of the car.

331
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,546
If you're getting on the car,

332
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,746
before touching the door, touch the ground.

333
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:51,646
If you're going to touch the door knob, touch the wall first

334
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,846
to release the static build up in your body.

335
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,046
There seems to be people who are so afraid of static

336
00:18:57,046 --> 00:19:00,746
that they try to touch the object with just one finger,

337
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:02,946
but in order to disperse the amount of overcharged static,

338
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:05,546
it's better to touch the object with the palm of your hand

339
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:08,446
to avoid the prick.

340
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,646
If Mr. Sudo didn't like wool sweaters,

341
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:12,146
didn't usually wear them,

342
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:15,146
and wasn't exposed to too much static,

343
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,146
you could coordinate a combination of wool and fleece

344
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:21,046
that help in building up static.

345
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:23,246
Then if you make him insert the key into the keyhole,

346
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,346
there is a high possibility that static would occur.

347
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:30,446
Besides, he would be off his guard that static won't happen to him.

348
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:34,046
But why on earth did you choose to kill him this way?

349
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:36,746
Because you not only want to get rid of Mr. Sudo,

350
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:39,146
but wanted to get rid of the car too.

351
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,646
Yes, that's right.

352
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,946
I wanted to get rid of him as well as that car

353
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,946
and erase them from this world.

354
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,646
I wanted to get rid of

355
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:54,146
that ruthless devil disguised under the face of a human!

356
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:56,946
My father had a bad heart.

357
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,246
He got an attack when he was out driving

358
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,346
with my mother who couldn't drive.

359
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,046
Since they were in a mountain road

360
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:05,846
where there were not too many people around,

361
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:08,246
they couldn't get to a hospital and father died.

362
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:11,946
But he was just unlucky.

363
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,646
Yes, it's true that he was unlucky

364
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:20,346
because right after my father had the attack and stopped his car,

365
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:24,946
the car that happened to pass by was the car of that guy.

366
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:27,846
My mother begged him to take them to the hospital,

367
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,446
but he told her...

368
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:34,246
Stay here till you die, old lady!

369
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,646
From the shock of that incident,

370
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:41,446
my mother fell ill and passed away

371
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,646
as if going after father.

372
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:49,646
Before she died, mother told me that the car that the guy drove

373
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:55,946
had a silver statue with its wings spread out.

374
00:20:55,946 --> 00:21:00,746
So, I checked everywhere I could for the owner of a classic car

375
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:04,546
with a silver statue with its wings spread out.

376
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,846
But Sonny, you sure go all out.

377
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:12,346
If that girl inserted the key into the keyhole before I stopped her,

378
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:14,546
I hate to think what would've happened.

379
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:15,846
No problem.

380
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:18,846
There is no keyhole on the trunk of a Beetle.

381
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:20,046
And with the mail I sent a while ago,

382
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,146
I asked a certain person

383
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:25,446
to change the contents in the tank to water too.

384
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,646
This racing game sure is fun!

385
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:58,146
Doc sure does a good job at times!

386
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:00,046
Huh? Where's Ai?

387
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,646
I'm sure she's up already.

388
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:07,846
Don't tell me that she's still in a bad mood?

389
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,046
Come off it.

390
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:13,946
Ai was suffering with static pricking at her from morning.

391
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,146
And on top of that, she seems to have lost

392
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,746
her static proof goods too.

393
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:22,446
Opening the palm of your hand completely would help.

394
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,746
Ai, why don't you join us playing the game too?

395
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:40,246
It's fun!

396
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,446
Okay.

397
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:45,046
But I'm a strong player, you know.

398
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:48,546
Ai, can you do that?

399
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:50,346
You're the tops, the lone victor!

400
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,346
Wow! Wow!

401
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:55,346
It sure feels weird when she's in a good mood though.

402
00:23:57,346 --> 00:24:00,146
"Next episode" -The man sitting at the counter

403
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:03,046
looks just like a man that I know!

404
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:06,246
Well, you see...

405
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,746
The victim is Azusa's older brother,

406
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,646
Sugito's superior and...

407
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:13,746
We're staking out here

408
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:15,446
because he may contact his younger sister.

409
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,846
Conan.

410
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:21,846
This is...

411
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:23,346
Next Conan,

412
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:27,246
"A Delivery From the Real Culprit".

413
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:40,246
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,346
"The ribbon of a parcel".

415
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,846
The coffee shop Poirot is below the agency.

416
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:46,146
I am Poirot.

417
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:47,485
No, you're not.
