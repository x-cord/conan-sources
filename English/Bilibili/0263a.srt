1
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:03,482
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:05,482
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:09,082
Naniwa is the stage for a tag team match of Conan and Heiji.

4
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:10,582
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:12,382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,282
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,882
"Osaka Double Mystery:"

8
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:56,882
"The Naniwa Swordsman And Hideyoshi Toyotomi's Castle"

9
00:01:57,282 --> 00:02:00,482
"Naniwa Chuo Gymnasium"

10
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,982
Strike to the mask!

11
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:05,382
Match is over!

12
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:07,782
Nice going! That's 3 wins and 1 draw,

13
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:10,182
he qualifies for the preliminaries!

14
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:14,082
Right. All the members on Kaiho High School's team this year is strong.

15
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:17,282
They're undefeated so far in the group competition.

16
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:19,382
Mrs. Hattori. Don't get all worked up

17
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,782
until you're seen our captain.

18
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:23,582
Heiji's gotten stronger than a demon.

19
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:26,382
Oh, is Heiji Kaiho High's captain?

20
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:29,282
He doesn't tell us anything at home.

21
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,782
Kaiho High School team captain, come forward!

22
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:32,782
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,282
Huh? That's not Heiji.

24
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,882
Isn't that him over there?

25
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:43,882
Over there, surrounded by all those girls and talking up a storm.

26
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,682
Hey, Heiji!

27
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,182
What the heck are you doing, goofing off over here for?

28
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:50,582
The match has already started! You've got to hurry!

29
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:52,582
Huh? You're pale.

30
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,182
Hello.

31
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,582
I know you. You're a sophomore, aren't you?

32
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:01,282
Heiji asked me to cover for him.

33
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,282
He said that we probably wouldn't need him until the semi-finals

34
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,382
so he told me to put his gear on

35
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:07,782
and just intimidate the other team.

36
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:11,782
But Heiji's so popular so all the girls flock around me

37
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,382
when they see his name on the uniform.

38
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,682
So where did Heiji go?

39
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,582
I think he went to the toilet.

40
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,482
I saw him heading toward the other building.

41
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:22,582
"Annex" -Listen up.

42
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:23,782
I'm going to tell you one more time.

43
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,482
To get to the Naniwa Chuo Gymnasium,

44
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,282
take the bus headed for Tojiri

45
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,782
and get off at the 7th stop.

46
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:33,082
If you don't know which bus, ask the driver.

47
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,882
Ask them which gymnasium is holding the Kinki Kendo Competition

48
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,982
that Heiji Hattori's competing in, they'll know!

49
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:42,182
Okay, I got it.

50
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:45,782
I'm not a little kid. You don't have to keep reminding me.

51
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,582
Sorry. You look like a little kid, so I forget.

52
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:52,882
Never mind, just don't call me anymore.

53
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:56,082
I'm having a hard time getting away from Ran and the old man.

54
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,882
And another thing. We're going to Osaka

55
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,582
because you invited us to a tetchiri dinner

56
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:00,682
since we didn't get to eat it the last time

57
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:03,782
or the time before that at your place.

58
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:04,782
The only reason we're going to watch you compete is,

59
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,482
it's on the same day.

60
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,882
You always give me the cold treatment.

61
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,982
By the way, this bullet train just left the station,

62
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:14,782
so it'll be past 2:00 when we get there.

63
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,682
Won't your match be over by then?

64
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:18,282
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,282
The semi-finals don't start until 2 pm.

66
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,582
You'll make it in time for the finals.

67
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,082
Oh, okay.

68
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:25,882
So I'll be waiting to see you.

69
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,082
Kazuha?

70
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,582
What are you doing in there?

71
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:31,882
That's what I'd like to ask you!

72
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:33,382
This is the men's toilet, you know!

73
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:36,082
Really? I didn't notice that.

74
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,082
I thought it was a hiding place

75
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:41,282
for cowards who didn't want to compete.

76
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,682
I'm planning my moves.

77
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,282
So that I can beat that guy in the finals.

78
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,882
By that guy, are you talking about

79
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,782
that guy that looks just like Kudo?

80
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:52,282
That's right. Okita from Senshin High School in Kyoto.

81
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,782
Last year, he got me with jabs to the neck.

82
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:58,382
I'm going to pay him back for this scar behind my ear.

83
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,582
Just because he beat you before,

84
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:02,582
don't you think you're being kind of sneaky?

85
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,982
Don't be stupid! He didn't beat me.

86
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,482
I got cut on the neck when I dodged the jab,

87
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:08,782
and when it wouldn't stop bleeding,

88
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:11,582
the doctor stopped the match.

89
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:13,982
Besides, the guy skipped the first and second match,

90
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,982
he was sleeping behind the gym

91
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,682
and then he took me on.

92
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,382
You don't have to worry about him, you can beat him.

93
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,682
You brought your lucky charm, didn't you?

94
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:23,682
That's not the only reason

95
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,382
I skipped the first and second matches though.

96
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:30,082
The truth is, it's my right hand

97
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:32,982
remember what happened on Bikuni Island.

98
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:36,382
It's so itchy, it's driving me crazy!

99
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:39,382
I can't concentrate on the match!

100
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,982
Is that so? Fine then!

101
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:45,282
I'm going to have a talk with your mother.

102
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:47,082
And have her beat some heart and soul into you.

103
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,882
What? Mom's here?

104
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:49,882
Hey, Kazuha, wait!

105
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,582
What's the matter with you? You idiot!

106
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:55,882
-Idiot? -No, that wasn't me.

107
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:58,382
Did you say you can't compete because you have a hangover?

108
00:05:58,382 --> 00:05:59,982
I couldn't help it.

109
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,082
The company that informally promised to hire me went bankrupt.

110
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,082
I was so floored. I had to have a drink.

111
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:07,382
You blockhead! You should have thought about the consequences!

112
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:08,982
Let's all settle down.

113
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,582
There's still over an hour left in the competition.

114
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:12,782
He's right.

115
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:15,382
Let's all calm down and come up with a plan.

116
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:23,082
You know, I could tell everybody about that.

117
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,382
What did you say?

118
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,582
Unlike the rest of you who all have jobs waiting,

119
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:29,382
I've got nothing to lose.

120
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,282
I don't know what you're talking about,

121
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:32,882
but if you don't want to compete,

122
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:34,882
then we'll just have to send in one of the seniors

123
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:37,082
although they aren't as good as you.

124
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,582
We can't have the whole team be embarrassed

125
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:42,082
just because of you.

126
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:45,082
For a guy who stole another guy's girlfriend, you sure talk big.

127
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:48,782
You're a fool. She made up her own mind to leave you.

128
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:51,082
I didn't steal her away.

129
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:54,782
Listen, I think you'd better sober up and start thinking about

130
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,982
how to get rid of that chip on your shoulder,

131
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:00,282
and what you're going to do with the rest of your life.

132
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:05,482
Kill...

133
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:06,982
I'm going to kill you.

134
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:10,282
What're you doing, Heiji? Come on, hurry!

135
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:11,982
Yeah, okay.

136
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:21,782
Chest jab, point!

137
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,782
Yes! Good move!

138
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:26,682
Hey, I can't find Tarumi anywhere.

139
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,082
Maybe he went home?

140
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,682
Good grief. You guys go look around there.

141
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:34,282
Okay.

142
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,382
Hey! Why aren't you paying attention to the match?

143
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:41,982
Go and score those points fast.

144
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:43,982
Make it to the best four!

145
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,482
"Annex" -Did you find him?

146
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,082
No, he wasn't in the toilet or the fencing hall.

147
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,282
Did you look in the storage room?

148
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:53,582
No, not yet.

149
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:57,082
But he wouldn't be here in the middle of the competition.

150
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:04,082
Ta... Tarumi?

151
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,882
How horrible!

152
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:07,882
Somebody, get an ambulance!

153
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,782
Okay, I'll go call for the ambulance!

154
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,782
Omotani, you go to the police box and get the police!

155
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:15,882
All right, then I'll go back to the gym

156
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:17,782
and tell Hakamata about this.

157
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:20,182
Okay! Go quick and bring him back here!

158
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:21,682
Okay!

159
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:25,782
Yahoo! We're in the best 4!

160
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,082
I think we can win the championship!

161
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:30,382
Tarumi's dead? Are you sure?

162
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:33,182
Pretty sure. I couldn't tell if he was breathing

163
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:34,582
but he was covered with blood!

164
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,082
Where is he?

165
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,682
Who the heck are you?

166
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,082
I asked you where he is!

167
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:52,182
What is this? There's nothing in here.

168
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:55,682
That's strange.

169
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:59,382
We found him here, leaning against this vaulting horse.

170
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:02,982
What kind of doll is this?

171
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:06,082
I think it's a doll you use to practice life saving techniques on.

172
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:09,882
You know, like mouth to mouth resuscitation.

173
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,482
Are you sure you didn't mistake this doll for your friend?

174
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:14,882
That's ridiculous!

175
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:17,582
Hey! Police is here!

176
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:21,482
The ambulance will be here in about 10 minutes.

177
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:24,582
Thing is, we can't find Tarumi.

178
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:25,982
What did you say?

179
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,982
You don't think Tarumi pulled a fast one on us, do you?

180
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:33,182
What?

181
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:36,182
Come on, let's split up and look for Tarumi!

182
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:38,982
If this is some kind of joke, I'm going to teach him a lesson!

183
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:40,682
Excuse me.

184
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,982
Are you from Shinnai University?

185
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,482
Yeah, that's right. What is it?

186
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:51,182
A call just came in to the reception desk from a strange man.

187
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,982
He said to tell the guys from Shinnai University

188
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:55,082
who are in the storage room now

189
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:58,582
to go to the locker room beside the pool.

190
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,182
It's got to be Tarumi!

191
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,582
That sneak! What a stinker!

192
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,282
Let's go and check it out.

193
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:07,782
"Shower room"

194
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,282
Ta... Tarumi!

195
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:22,282
Is this for real?

196
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:24,882
He's really dead.

197
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:29,882
I don't believe it.

198
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,629
The body in the storage room

199
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,329
is moved to the locker room beside the pool while no one is watching.

200
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,429
Dees that mean someone moved it?

201
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,929
But if you were carrying a body as bloody as that,

202
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,829
someone's bound to notice.

203
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,729
There's a team from some school

204
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,529
sitting around the doorway in the annex having their lunch.

205
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,429
Why go to such lengths?

206
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,429
Hey, Heiji!

207
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,229
What're you doing? You haven't even eaten your lunch!

208
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,929
There's less than an hour left before the semi-finals.

209
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,529
Shut up. I'm on a case!

210
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,129
There's been a murder in the locker room over there.

211
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,029
What? Are you serious?

212
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,729
But I don't understand something

213
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:22,529
so I can't concentrate on the match.

214
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,729
Then maybe you should ask Kudo for advice.

215
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,629
Are they coming here, aren't they?

216
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,929
That's right, Kudo! I'll just give him a call.

217
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,429
Kudo would be able to solve the case in no time.

218
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,629
You don't have to lose any sleep over it.

219
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,829
Let Kudo handle the investigation,

220
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,229
you get back to the match, come on!

221
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:43,629
Listen, Kazuha.

222
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,429
Don't you dare tell Kudo about the murder.

223
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:47,429
-What? -Don't forget what I said!

224
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:48,829
Heiji!

225
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,329
Kudo won't get here for another hour and a half.

226
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,729
I've got to solve this case by then!

227
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,329
You've got rice on yourself again.

228
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,329
What? Did you say murder?

229
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,829
Then you mean, Hattori's...

230
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,529
That's right. He said he doesn't have time to compete.

231
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,429
He's running around looking for clues.

232
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,029
What're we going to do?

233
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,429
The semi-finals are going to start already.

234
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:19,829
We don't have a choice.

235
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,129
We've got to take the championship without Heiji.

236
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,929
Then we'll break that darn mystery fool's nose in half!

237
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:32,529
Excuse me. We're the ones who're going to be in the match.

238
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,529
You're positive he's one of your team mates?

239
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,829
Yes, that's right.

240
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,629
His name's Tarumi. We're classmates at the same university.

241
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:48,429
The killer must have put him under the hot shower

242
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,029
to mask the time of death.

243
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:53,429
Well, it's plain to see

244
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:55,729
that the murder weapon is this sword.

245
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:56,929
As soon as we find out who it belongs to,

246
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,529
we'll have the killer...

247
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,129
You're wrong about that, Inspector Otaki.

248
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,429
The "fast draw" instructor brought it to the competition

249
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:07,829
because he was going to put on a demonstration using a real sword.

250
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,729
Somebody probably saw it left in the dressing room,

251
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,529
stole it and used it to commit the murder.

252
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,029
Heiji, what're you doing here?

253
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,229
Can't you tell by looking at me? I'm competing.

254
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:22,029
Oh, I remember now! Today's the day of the big competition

255
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,929
between Kinki's high school and college teams.

256
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,329
So do you have any idea who stole this sword?

257
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:28,529
Sort of.

258
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,729
The killer's somebody who comes to this competition a lot

259
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,629
and knows about the fast draw demonstration.

260
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:36,429
That person also knows the layout of the place,

261
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:38,729
the gym, the annex and the locker room.

262
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:42,729
Which means, the killer is somebody just like you guys.

263
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,829
I understand the part about having to know

264
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,129
about the demonstration and stealing the sword

265
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,529
but what does knowing about the gym and annex and locker room

266
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,729
have to do with anything?

267
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,429
Because if the killer didn't know the locations of these places,

268
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:56,129
it wouldn't be possible to move Mr. Tarumi

269
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,029
from the annex to this locker room without being seen.

270
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,329
What bothers me is, not why he was moved but how.

271
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:04,429
Because when it happened, there was a group of people

272
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,329
sitting in front of the annex eating their lunch.

273
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:09,329
It would've been impossible for them not to notice

274
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,529
a man covered with blood being carried out.

275
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:15,629
Unless of course,

276
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:18,229
after you guys found Mr. Tarumi in the storage room,

277
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,729
the last one to leave the place

278
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,829
very cleverly managed to carry him out.

279
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,129
Do you guys remember what happened?

280
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:29,429
The first one to leave was Kotegawa here.

281
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,929
He said he was going to call an ambulance.

282
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,229
Then I left.

283
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:38,529
Kotegawa told me to go to the police box and get the police.

284
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,929
So that means, Mr. Doguchi,

285
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,729
you were the last to leave, weren't you?

286
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:49,229
But I left right away to get Hakamata who was in the gym.

287
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:50,929
How do I know you're not lying?

288
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,029
I... I said I was going, didn't I?

289
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,529
Yeah.

290
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,429
Besides, Doguchi wasn't the last one to leave, it was me.

291
00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:59,529
What?

292
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,829
I knew we needed the ambulance as soon as possible

293
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,029
so when I saw a group of high school students

294
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,429
hanging around the entrance,

295
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,529
I borrowed their cell phone.

296
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,229
But the person I was talking to

297
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:12,229
asked me to describe the injured person's condition

298
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:15,429
so I went back and described Tarumi's condition.

299
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,629
Of course, there was nobody else around.

300
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:21,129
As soon as I was finished,

301
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,829
I went back to return the cellphone

302
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,929
then I headed for the police box.

303
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:27,029
Is that the truth?

304
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:29,729
Yes, he came to the police box.

305
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,529
I'm not good at explaining things, so I was relieved he came.

306
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:35,729
And how long did it take to go from the annex

307
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,729
to the police box then back again?

308
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,429
There's a big intersection in front of the police box

309
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:43,129
and we got stuck at the light...

310
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,829
I think it took about 14 to 15 minutes.

311
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,829
Did you say 14 to 15 minutes?

312
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,929
Don't you think that's strange. Mr. Doguchi?

313
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,529
Mr. Omotani and Mr. Kotegawa

314
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,829
came back with the police right after we arrived.

315
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,229
The gym is right by the annex,

316
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:03,129
don't you think it took an unusually long time to get Mr. Hakamata?

317
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,529
He probably had a hard time finding me.

318
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,729
The place was filled with guys wearing the same kind of outfits.

319
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:16,829
This means, you also had some unaccounted time.

320
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,129
I don't care if you suspect us,

321
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,829
but can you tell me one thing first?

322
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:25,929
Explain how you can get Tarumi, who was in that condition,

323
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,429
out of the storage room in the annex

324
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,629
into the locker room without being seen?

325
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:30,629
Yeah, that's right!

326
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,529
If you can't explain that,

327
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,429
then you can't prove we're guilty!

328
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,629
Don't make up stories.

329
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,729
Well, Detective, we're going to see Tarumi's mother

330
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:43,229
and tell her what happened today.

331
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:47,629
Hakamata, you're the only one without a sash. Why's that?

332
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:51,729
I thought I brought it with me, but I guess I lost it.

333
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:54,029
Well, it looks like we're going to forfeit the match

334
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,729
so I guess I won't be needing it anyway.

335
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,429
Speaking of match, Heiji, how did you do today?

336
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,629
Did you win? Or did you lose?

337
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:07,729
Heiji?

338
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,829
Hit on the forearm, 1 point!

339
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,229
Way to go! We scored!

340
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:15,629
All we've got to do is hang in there until it's time

341
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:16,829
and then we're in the finals!

342
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,929
That's right!

343
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,129
We don't need Heiji to win the championship!

344
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,829
Thrust to the neck, 1 point!

345
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,329
4 to 1, the match goes to Kyoto Senshin High School!

346
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,529
Kyoto Senshin High School?

347
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,329
It's Okita, just like Heiji said.

348
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,129
This is not good!

349
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:40,029
Without Heiji, we don't stand a chance.

350
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,429
The windows behind the annex don't open

351
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,029
and the ones in the front are too noticeable.

352
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:00,929
The front door is only way.

353
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:05,629
But to carry him to the locker room beside the pool,

354
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:07,029
I'd have to pass the front of the gym

355
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:10,629
where there were a lot of people.

356
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:12,029
It's impossible.

357
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:14,329
Somebody's bound to notice a man covered with blood

358
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,729
being carried past them.

359
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,029
Gosh!

360
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,129
Kudo's going to be here in less than 10 minutes.

361
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,429
Hey, you! Wait up!

362
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,529
You just came out of the annex, didn't you?

363
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:30,929
What were you doing?

364
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,229
I only went to the toilet.

365
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:37,429
Sorry, but there's something I want to ask you.

366
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,129
What is it?

367
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,829
Before Mr. Tarumi was killed, I heard him say,

368
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,229
"You know, I could tell everybody about that".

369
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:47,129
What was that about?

370
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:51,229
How would I know? I don't know anything!

371
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:53,629
All right then, is the girl Mr. Tarumi and Mr. Hakamata

372
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:57,029
were fighting about here today?

373
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,929
Of course not!

374
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,229
After that incident, Haori quit managing the kendo team!

375
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:06,029
That incident? What do you mean?

376
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:07,929
Did you see Okita's thrust?

377
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,729
Yeah. You can kill somebody with that one.

378
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:14,229
Hey, come back!

379
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,129
Huh? That's the guy.

380
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:21,029
He's running again like he was when we were eating lunch.

381
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,229
What?

382
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:27,029
Where you guys eating lunch around the door to the annex?

383
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,729
Yeah, that was us.

384
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,929
There were three weird college students.

385
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,529
They asked to borrow a cell phone,

386
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,029
and then they brought the police and other people, it was a circus.

387
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,229
All right then, after those three left the annex,

388
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,329
did any suspicious person go in there?

389
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,729
Yeah, there was one guy!

390
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:44,029
You!

391
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,029
Dummy! Before me!

392
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,829
There was one suspicious guy that came out of the annex.

393
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:49,829
What?

394
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:52,629
He was carrying somebody else's gear in a bag.

395
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,729
How could you tell it wasn't his?

396
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:56,229
That was easy.

397
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,729
He was carrying the bag

398
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,029
while he was wearing his mask and protective gear.

399
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,229
So that's how he did it! A gear bag!

400
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:04,929
If you put the body in there and carried it out,

401
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,729
nobody would get suspicious.

402
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:10,129
Mr. Hakamata's the only one would could've done it.

403
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:12,029
He killed Mr. Tarumi beforehand

404
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:14,129
and hid the body in the storage room.

405
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,429
And while he has the others looking for Mr. Tarumi,

406
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,129
he goes back to the storage room

407
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:22,329
and after the other three find the body and go for help,

408
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,729
he puts Mr. Tarumi in the gear bag

409
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:27,129
and sneaks toward the locker room.

410
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,629
No, that's not possible.

411
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,129
Even if you were hiding in that storage room,

412
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,929
there's no guarantee somebody would look in there.

413
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,829
Besides, it was just coincidence

414
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:37,229
that all three of them left the storage room.

415
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,529
If someone decided to remain,

416
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,029
then he wouldn't be able to come out.

417
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,029
Hey!

418
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,329
You better watch yourself kid

419
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,529
or you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

420
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:47,629
I hear you've been asking about Haori too.

421
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,729
You already told him?

422
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,029
Of course he did!

423
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:53,429
Doguchi and me go way back.

424
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:55,929
Whenever he is in trouble, he always comes to tell me.

425
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,329
We made a pact when we were little kids.

426
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,429
You're way off course suspecting him though.

427
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,429
He's a coward. He can't stand the sight of blood.

428
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,229
What?

429
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,929
Listen carefully! Don't be a pest!

430
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,729
Hello?

431
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,329
Hattori, it's me.

432
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:18,929
Kudo, it's you.

433
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,929
Where are you? On the bus?

434
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,529
No. Pops didn't want to wait for the bus

435
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,429
so we got on a cab.

436
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,729
All right, take your time!

437
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,829
In fact, why don't you get off and have a bowl of noodles?

438
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,929
Maybe even walk around and do some sightseeing.

439
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,929
Don't be stupid. We already told the driver where to go.

440
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,629
We're on our way there.

441
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,629
What?

442
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,829
By the way, you're in the finals, aren't you?

443
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:45,429
Hey, Hattori. You there?

444
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:48,129
Hey, guys.

445
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:52,129
Do you know about the life saving dolls in the storage room?

446
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:55,329
Sure, because we came here a lot to practice.

447
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,629
How many dolls do they have in there?

448
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,029
Two. One skinny one and one big one.

449
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,629
That's it!

450
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,829
Isn't he Hattori from Kaiho High?

451
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:10,829
What's he doing here? The finals are starting already.

452
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:17,729
If my theory's right, it should be here.

453
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:21,329
It should still be here in this storage room.

454
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,629
I knew it!

455
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,129
This is what the killer used to move the body.

456
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:33,929
Heiji! Heiji, where are you?

457
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,729
That fool! Where the heck is he?

458
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,329
Kazuha!

459
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:42,829
We're here to root for Heiji!

460
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,729
Ran!

461
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:47,029
Is Hattori's team in the finals'?

462
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:50,029
Yes! And it's starting soon

463
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:52,729
-but Heiji's gone off somewhere. -What?

464
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:55,329
I just know he's running around

465
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:58,129
trying to solve the murder that just happened.

466
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:01,029
Murder?
