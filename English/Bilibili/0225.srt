1
00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:20.932
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:22.832
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:24.432
Today's episode is a unique type of mystery story.

4
00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:26.632
Flourishing business is the entrance to a criminal case.

5
00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.132
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.032
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:32.232
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:02.668
"The Secret To A Successful Business"

9
00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:06.368
"Teitan Elementary School"

10
00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:11.268
A suspicious man?

11
00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:15.468
Your family has a diner's business, right?

12
00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:19.368
I know. Manpuku Diner's.

13
00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:21.268
The shop is dark, dirty

14
00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:25.968
and because everything tastes lousy, it's always empty.

15
00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:27.468
Oh, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.868
And, in what way is that man suspicious?

17
00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:34.368
He suddenly came around 2 months ago.

18
00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:37.568
My name is Yuji Kamekura.

19
00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:41.468
I owe the shop owner who passed away my gratitude.

20
00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:43.568
To my deceased husband?

21
00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:45.268
What kind of gratitude?

22
00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:48.268
It's something so great that I could never express it in words.

23
00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.568
So, in order to pay the master back,

24
00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:52.168
I'm wondering if you'd let me stay here

25
00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:55.668
and work for you as a token of my gratitude, yes.

26
00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:58.968
You mean you want us to let you live here?

27
00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:02.868
We can't afford hiring anyone.

28
00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:04.868
I'm not asking to be paid.

29
00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:08.068
I just want to pay him back for what he did for me.

30
00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:09.768
Please let me.

31
00:03:09.768 --> 00:03:12.168
Okay, I've got to get to work.

32
00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:17.368
So saying, he forced his way into our house.

33
00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.468
But, something is definitely strange.

34
00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.668
Because grandpa who passed away, was stingy

35
00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:24.868
and had a bad personality.

36
00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:28.268
He would never do a favor for anybody.

37
00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:31.268
I'm sure that man is up to something.

38
00:03:31.268 --> 00:03:32.268
That's why

39
00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:36.068
I want the Youth Detective Squad to find out what it is.

40
00:03:36.068 --> 00:03:39.468
Shoots. I thought it was going to be an interesting case,

41
00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:43.968
but it's nothing but a liar trying to freeload.

42
00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:47.268
I smell something super fishy that made lead to a crime.

43
00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.768
-Same here. -I do too.

44
00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:53.468
Yes, it smells, really smells super fishy.

45
00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.368
Haibara?

46
00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:58.968
All right. It's show time for the Youth Detective Squad!

47
00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:02.168
Give it all you've got, Edogawa,

48
00:04:02.168 --> 00:04:04.868
because I unfortunately have other commitments.

49
00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:06.468
Bye-bye.

50
00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:09.468
Hey, don't walk away like that, no fair, Haibara.

51
00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:16.468
What? You mean, this is Manpuku Diners?

52
00:04:16.468 --> 00:04:20.268
-So, what? -The shop's so pretty now.

53
00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:23.768
Look at all those customers.

54
00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:28.368
It's because of that man.

55
00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:37.068
We got no customers at all again today.

56
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.668
As usual...

57
00:04:40.568 --> 00:04:44.368
After all, there are loads of delicious and nice diners so...

58
00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:48.868
We can't go on like this.

59
00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:55.168
Okay. I have experience as a cook

60
00:04:55.168 --> 00:04:57.468
so I'll give you special training in cooking.

61
00:04:57.468 --> 00:04:59.068
And, let's renovate the shop

62
00:04:59.068 --> 00:05:00.468
to make it brighter and more cheerful.

63
00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:02.868
Renovate the shop?

64
00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.968
I'll dish out all the cash.

65
00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:06.868
Please don't be hesitant because all I want to do is

66
00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:09.568
repay the favor that was done for me.

67
00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:16.268
And the shop started doing unbelievably good.

68
00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:17.968
What's so suspicious about all that?

69
00:05:17.968 --> 00:05:19.868
He dished out his own money to renovate the shop

70
00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:22.268
as a token of his gratitude, right?

71
00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:24.268
He's a nice man.

72
00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:25.268
I got it.

73
00:05:25.268 --> 00:05:26.768
He's going to make good business

74
00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:30.468
and split after taking all the money.

75
00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.768
Is that what the man's thinking?

76
00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:34.768
If he wants to split with the cash,

77
00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.768
why should he help the shop make money, then steal it?

78
00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:39.168
Wouldn't it be faster for him to pick

79
00:05:39.168 --> 00:05:40.668
a flourishing shop to begin with?

80
00:05:40.668 --> 00:05:42.768
Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.768
Smell of a crime, my foot.

82
00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:50.068
-Just what does that mean? -What?

83
00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:55.068
Researching new menu, absolutely off-limits, Kamekura.

84
00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:58.168
The man's in the room from morning to night

85
00:05:58.168 --> 00:06:01.368
thinking up new menus.

86
00:06:01.368 --> 00:06:03.568
He won't even let us in, saying that it is a secret

87
00:06:03.568 --> 00:06:05.768
until he completes the menu.

88
00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:07.568
Rintaro!

89
00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.868
We're busy, so if you're home, you've gotta help.

90
00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:14.568
Come on, say bye-bye to your friends.

91
00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:18.268
I see.

92
00:06:18.268 --> 00:06:20.968
If the shop gets busy, the members of the family

93
00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:24.768
will have to stay at the shop all day.

94
00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:27.468
In the meantime, the one who proposed all this

95
00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:30.768
stays secretly confined to his room.

96
00:06:30.768 --> 00:06:34.868
This sure sounds like the pattern of The Red-Headed League?

97
00:06:34.868 --> 00:06:36.768
It can't be.

98
00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:37.968
I've got it.

99
00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:42.068
I'm sure that this is the pattern of the Red-Headed League.

100
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.968
Oh, The Red-Headed League.

101
00:06:44.968 --> 00:06:46.468
What's that?

102
00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:51.368
The Red-Headed League is one of the most famous

103
00:06:51.368 --> 00:06:54.168
among the 600 stories of Sherlock Holmes.

104
00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:57.468
A man who sneaks into a shop as an employee,

105
00:06:57.468 --> 00:06:59.068
gets the shop owner to step out of the shop

106
00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:00.268
by telling a clever lie.

107
00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:03.768
In the meantime, he digs a tunnel underground towards the bank

108
00:07:03.768 --> 00:07:07.468
in an attempt to rob it.

109
00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.068
It is a masterpiece that describes

110
00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:12.468
a very bold and bizarre crime.

111
00:07:12.468 --> 00:07:15.068
Thanks for the explanation.

112
00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.168
But, I'd like to add that it was written

113
00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:18.968
more than a hundred years ago.

114
00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:20.268
I wonder where in the world today

115
00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:21.468
you can find a criminal so patient

116
00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:24.568
who'd dig a tunnel in order to steal valuables.

117
00:07:27.368 --> 00:07:29.368
What are you guys doing?

118
00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:32.368
If he's digging a tunnel, we should be able to hear something.

119
00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:36.268
Stop acting silly.

120
00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.968
I'll go check it out for you!

121
00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:40.668
Check it out?

122
00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:50.668
-Is he the one? -Yes.

123
00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:53.068
What is it, Rintaro?

124
00:07:53.068 --> 00:07:54.468
Well...

125
00:07:54.468 --> 00:07:57.368
We're sorry to bother you when you're busy.

126
00:07:57.368 --> 00:08:00.368
You must be the God of Fortune because the minute you came,

127
00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:02.868
the shop is so busy.

128
00:08:02.868 --> 00:08:06.668
I came wanting to see what the palm of the God of Fortune looks like.

129
00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:08.268
The palm of my hand?

130
00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:10.068
Oh. Sure.

131
00:08:10.068 --> 00:08:11.868
Go ahead and take a look at it.

132
00:08:11.868 --> 00:08:13.468
This is...

133
00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:16.468
This can't be... hey.

134
00:08:20.068 --> 00:08:24.168
Hey, it was, wasn't it? The hand of a criminal?

135
00:08:24.168 --> 00:08:26.868
That's not what I checked for.

136
00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:30.268
He had a lot of blisters and callus on his hand.

137
00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:32.568
It's the hand of one who uses a shovel.

138
00:08:32.568 --> 00:08:34.068
It's hard to believe

139
00:08:34.068 --> 00:08:36.568
but I'm sure he's digging a hole under the house.

140
00:08:36.568 --> 00:08:39.368
I told you so.

141
00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:41.468
You're fantastic, Mitsuhiko.

142
00:08:43.368 --> 00:08:46.768
Too bad Mitsuhiko got the credit this time.

143
00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:50.268
But can something like this really be happening?

144
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:51.568
The thing is,

145
00:08:51.568 --> 00:08:54.368
where is the tunnel that he's digging headed towards?

146
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.768
Conan?

147
00:09:00.368 --> 00:09:01.868
I see.

148
00:09:01.868 --> 00:09:05.568
The closest bank from Manpuku Diners is here.

149
00:09:05.568 --> 00:09:09.668
But, it's closed.

150
00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:12.268
This bank's been closed down since a week ago.

151
00:09:12.268 --> 00:09:14.168
So, it can't be here.

152
00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:19.768
Wrong again. You seem to have swung at air again, Conan.

153
00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:24.768
Another place near here that could be a target would be...

154
00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:28.668
There's a jewelry shop.

155
00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:33.968
It's impossible for any thief

156
00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:35.968
to steal anything from our shop.

157
00:09:35.968 --> 00:09:39.668
Because this place is protected by a fail-proof security system,

158
00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:42.568
thanks to a bitter experience in the past.

159
00:09:42.568 --> 00:09:44.968
A bitter experience in the past?

160
00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:46.868
We've been robbed before

161
00:09:46.868 --> 00:09:50.868
of 3 billion yen worth of jewelry

162
00:09:50.868 --> 00:09:53.868
and the robber hasn't been arrested yet.

163
00:09:53.868 --> 00:09:58.268
A jewel thief and the thief hasn't been arrested yet?

164
00:09:58.268 --> 00:10:00.268
Maybe this could be...

165
00:10:00.268 --> 00:10:03.868
When were you robbed?

166
00:10:03.868 --> 00:10:06.968
Next month makes it exactly 5 years ago.

167
00:10:06.968 --> 00:10:09.368
I guess not, then.

168
00:10:09.368 --> 00:10:11.468
A jewel thief

169
00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:15.168
and a suspicious man who is secretly digging a hole underground.

170
00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:16.568
This could be...

171
00:10:16.568 --> 00:10:19.468
Mitsuhiko?

172
00:10:19.468 --> 00:10:20.968
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

173
00:10:20.968 --> 00:10:23.568
don't tell me that you're thinking that.

174
00:10:25.868 --> 00:10:28.268
Mitsuhiko!

175
00:10:28.268 --> 00:10:30.668
Well, I've got to go because I'm busy.

176
00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:32.468
Thank you.

177
00:10:32.468 --> 00:10:35.068
What were you asking her, Mitsuhiko?

178
00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:38.368
I've solved the mystery.

179
00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:42.068
That man called Mr. Kamekura is the one

180
00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:43.968
who stole the jewelry from that jewelry shop

181
00:10:43.968 --> 00:10:46.368
we just went to 5 years ago.

182
00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:49.068
-He's the jewel thief? -Really?

183
00:10:49.068 --> 00:10:52.268
I'm sure my deduction is correct.

184
00:10:52.268 --> 00:10:53.968
I thought so.

185
00:10:53.968 --> 00:10:57.868
But, that deduction's a bit too farfetched.

186
00:10:57.868 --> 00:11:00.568
However, the thief is no dunce.

187
00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:03.268
If he sells the loot immediately, he'll be caught,

188
00:11:03.268 --> 00:11:05.668
and it would also be too risky to keep the loot

189
00:11:05.668 --> 00:11:08.068
with him right through.

190
00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:10.168
Therefore, he buried the loot somewhere

191
00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:13.568
right after he stole it, for the time being.

192
00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:15.668
He happened to bury the loot right

193
00:11:15.668 --> 00:11:18.768
under Rintaro's house that was being re-built back then.

194
00:11:18.768 --> 00:11:21.768
The house was being re-built?

195
00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:25.668
Oh, so that's what you were asking the lady a while ago.

196
00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:29.568
Right. So, Kamekura forced his way into the house

197
00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:34.868
as a live-in employee, in order to gradually dig out the loot.

198
00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:36.968
Mitsuhiko, you're awesome.

199
00:11:36.968 --> 00:11:39.068
What a perfect deduction.

200
00:11:39.068 --> 00:11:41.768
I mean, it's not that much of a big deal.

201
00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:44.668
No need to be shy, renown detective.

202
00:11:44.668 --> 00:11:46.268
Why would he want to dig it out now,

203
00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:48.668
after leaving it buried for 5 years?

204
00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:51.968
Don't you get it, Conan?

205
00:11:51.968 --> 00:11:55.168
He was waiting for the statute to expire.

206
00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:57.468
The period of prescription expires in 5 years.

207
00:11:57.468 --> 00:12:00.568
Which means he can soon hold his head up high

208
00:12:00.568 --> 00:12:03.368
and sell the loot off.

209
00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:06.368
That only goes for criminal cases.

210
00:12:06.368 --> 00:12:08.468
The period of expiration for civil affairs is 20 years.

211
00:12:08.468 --> 00:12:10.068
Which means even if he digs it out now,

212
00:12:10.068 --> 00:12:13.868
he won't be able to own the jewelry.

213
00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:17.868
We don't know of such complicated rules.

214
00:12:17.868 --> 00:12:19.368
If we don't know about it,

215
00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:23.768
I'm sure the thief doesn't either.

216
00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:25.568
Hey.

217
00:12:25.568 --> 00:12:28.968
You're just argumentative by nature, aren't you, Conan?

218
00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:31.968
Mom always tells me that

219
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:35.568
it's important for people to accept things without argument.

220
00:12:35.568 --> 00:12:38.068
That's not the point.

221
00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:42.968
Let's go tell the police that he's actually a jewelry thief.

222
00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:44.968
Don't! There's no evidence!

223
00:12:44.968 --> 00:12:46.768
You'll just end up embarrassing yourselves!

224
00:12:46.768 --> 00:12:48.768
Shoots, okay.

225
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.668
All we've got to do is catch him in the act, right?

226
00:12:51.668 --> 00:12:53.368
Just what do you intend to do?

227
00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:56.168
I'm going to set up a trap.

228
00:12:56.168 --> 00:12:58.968
A trap. Hey.

229
00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:09.276
"Manpuku Diner"

230
00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:15.476
Oh, it's you.

231
00:13:15.476 --> 00:13:17.176
You want to see my palm again?

232
00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:21.576
We know about everything.

233
00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:22.576
What?

234
00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:26.576
You can deceive the eyes of we the Youth Detective Squad.

235
00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:31.076
Good-bye.

236
00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:34.776
Good-bye.

237
00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:42.576
So, now all we do is wait for him to fall for it.

238
00:13:42.576 --> 00:13:45.276
What kind of trap is that supposed to be?

239
00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:46.376
He'll panic, get flustered

240
00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:48.276
and commit himself right away, for sure.

241
00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:49.776
Sure.

242
00:13:49.776 --> 00:13:51.276
It's perfect.

243
00:13:51.276 --> 00:13:54.076
Where in the world would there be an adult who'd panic

244
00:13:54.076 --> 00:13:56.376
just because some grade schooler takes a jab at him?

245
00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:59.176
"The Next Morning"

246
00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:00.576
What? Your whole family

247
00:14:00.576 --> 00:14:03.376
is going on a 2 days 1 night hot spring trip?

248
00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:05.476
Yeah, Mr. Kamekura suddenly recommended

249
00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:07.676
father and the others to take a trip.

250
00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:11.276
He said that we should go on a trip and relax

251
00:14:11.276 --> 00:14:12.776
since we haven't had a day of rest

252
00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:15.476
after the shop started getting busy.

253
00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:18.876
And of course Mr. Kamekura's not going, right?

254
00:14:18.876 --> 00:14:22.776
Right, he says just our family should go and enjoy ourselves.

255
00:14:22.776 --> 00:14:24.876
He's making the entire family leave the house

256
00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:27.676
and then is planning to dig it out all at once.

257
00:14:27.676 --> 00:14:29.676
I'm sure that's it.

258
00:14:29.676 --> 00:14:32.476
Like I told you, Conan, he fell right for the trap

259
00:14:32.476 --> 00:14:34.876
and started making his move.

260
00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:37.176
It can't be.

261
00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:39.276
Can this really be happening?

262
00:14:44.876 --> 00:14:47.876
I don't have the slightest idea what's going on.

263
00:14:47.876 --> 00:14:51.076
You seem to be completely lost.

264
00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:53.776
Well, where in the world are there criminals

265
00:14:53.776 --> 00:14:56.076
that will make moves just because they're pushed from behind

266
00:14:56.076 --> 00:14:57.476
by a bunch of grade school kids?

267
00:14:57.476 --> 00:15:00.576
And, there are other things that I don't get either, like...

268
00:15:00.576 --> 00:15:03.176
Kudo, maybe the man you're dealing with

269
00:15:03.176 --> 00:15:09.676
is very different from the criminals that you've handled so far.

270
00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:11.876
In what way?

271
00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:14.876
He's an unsophisticated person.

272
00:15:14.876 --> 00:15:17.976
It's even harder to understand!

273
00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:23.776
Conan seems to have lost a lot of confidence.

274
00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:26.976
Yeah, he's so off this time.

275
00:15:26.976 --> 00:15:30.776
I hope he doesn't get sulky and become a juvenile delinquent.

276
00:15:30.776 --> 00:15:32.276
It's possible.

277
00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:35.476
That doesn't sound good at all.

278
00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:38.776
"Temporarily Closed"

279
00:15:38.776 --> 00:15:41.676
Are you sure you don't want to come along?

280
00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:43.476
No, because a friend of mine

281
00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:45.676
has been bugging me to spend the night at his place.

282
00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:47.576
Have a nice trip.

283
00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:52.876
In the past, going on a trip to a hot spring was unthinkable,

284
00:15:52.876 --> 00:15:54.076
even for a day.

285
00:15:54.076 --> 00:15:56.576
This is all thanks to business flourishing.

286
00:15:56.576 --> 00:15:59.376
Rather, to Mr. Kamekura.

287
00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:03.576
I'm really glad that such a good man has come.

288
00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:06.776
Okay, everyone's left.

289
00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:10.076
Now, all we have to do is wait for Mr. Kamekura to come home.

290
00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:13.076
Are you going to wait one whole night if he doesn't come back?

291
00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:15.776
What are you going to tell your parents?

292
00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.076
He's back.

293
00:16:24.076 --> 00:16:25.976
So, we go in there when the time is right

294
00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:29.176
and use this key that I borrowed from Rintaro to go inside,

295
00:16:29.176 --> 00:16:31.976
and catch Kamekura in the act.

296
00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:33.376
I see.

297
00:16:34.976 --> 00:16:37.076
Conan, you're not your spirited self.

298
00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:48.976
I've been digging day after day,

299
00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:51.276
but I haven't seen a glimpse of anything.

300
00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:55.076
I shouldn't have buried it so deep.

301
00:16:56.876 --> 00:16:58.176
There it is.

302
00:16:58.176 --> 00:17:00.076
I did it.

303
00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:05.876
I did it, the loot, the loot.

304
00:17:12.976 --> 00:17:14.376
That's it, mister.

305
00:17:17.176 --> 00:17:21.576
We have clearly confirmed the jewelry that have been buried.

306
00:17:25.276 --> 00:17:27.176
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:31.076
Oh, well, we're not the police.

308
00:17:31.076 --> 00:17:32.876
Come on, Conan.

309
00:17:32.876 --> 00:17:35.476
Huh? Come on, what?

310
00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:39.776
Aren't you going to thrust your deduction at the criminal?

311
00:17:39.776 --> 00:17:42.876
We'll let you have the best part.

312
00:17:42.876 --> 00:17:46.076
Because you had no room for highlight this time.

313
00:17:46.076 --> 00:17:48.576
I've got nothing to thrust at him.

314
00:17:48.576 --> 00:17:50.176
Come, get on with it.

315
00:17:50.176 --> 00:17:52.176
Give it your best shot, Conan.

316
00:17:54.076 --> 00:17:58.276
Mr. Kamekura, 5 years ago, you broke into a jewelry shop

317
00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.676
and stole 3 billion yen worth of jewelry.

318
00:18:01.676 --> 00:18:03.576
Exactly.

319
00:18:03.576 --> 00:18:05.976
See, he admits it.

320
00:18:05.976 --> 00:18:08.576
But, I'm no dunce.

321
00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:12.276
I knew that if I sold them off right away, I would be caught, so...

322
00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:15.276
I had my eyes fixed on

323
00:18:15.276 --> 00:18:17.576
the re-building construction that was underway.

324
00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:20.776
I buried the jewelry under the floor and fled.

325
00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:26.976
Then, I worked day after day so the police wouldn't suspect me.

326
00:18:26.976 --> 00:18:31.076
I endured everything, being shouted at, being hit and all.

327
00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:33.376
All my friends couldn't bear the apprenticeship

328
00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:34.976
and quit one after the other.

329
00:18:34.976 --> 00:18:36.976
But I stuck it out.

330
00:18:36.976 --> 00:18:39.276
Thinking, 5 years. After 5 years,

331
00:18:39.276 --> 00:18:42.576
the 3 billion yen worth of jewelry will be mine.

332
00:18:42.576 --> 00:18:45.376
This was what had kept me

333
00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:48.976
going through all the tough times.

334
00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:52.276
And, finally the 5 years that I've waited for all this time had come.

335
00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:55.076
I just couldn't wait till the time expired,

336
00:18:55.076 --> 00:18:57.676
I just had to dig it up as soon as possible.

337
00:18:57.676 --> 00:19:00.276
You figured that if you worked here as a live-in employee,

338
00:19:00.276 --> 00:19:03.476
you'd have the chance to dig it out.

339
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.376
But, it didn't go that easily.

340
00:19:05.376 --> 00:19:08.776
Since there were no customers, the shop was always slow

341
00:19:08.776 --> 00:19:10.476
and the members of the family

342
00:19:10.476 --> 00:19:12.476
were always rolling around on the floor.

343
00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:17.276
If this keeps up, you'll never get around to digging up the loot.

344
00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:20.376
Having no other choice, you renovated the shop

345
00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:22.376
with the money you had saved working,

346
00:19:22.376 --> 00:19:25.976
taught them the cooking that you had learned under apprenticeship,

347
00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:28.176
and by making business flourish,

348
00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:33.976
you succeeded in chasing the entire family out of the living room.

349
00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:37.376
You were finally able to work on digging up

350
00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.876
the jewelry that you buried.

351
00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:43.976
Isn't that right, Mr. Yuji Kamekura?

352
00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:45.976
It's exactly as you say.

353
00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:49.476
-And I thought so. -Our deduction was right on the ball.

354
00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:52.476
I just can't figure it out, please tell me.

355
00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:54.676
Why did you rush to dig it up,

356
00:19:54.676 --> 00:19:58.076
just because a bunch of grade school kids pushed you from behind?

357
00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:00.376
I'm really chicken.

358
00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:01.376
Even if you're only in grade school,

359
00:20:01.376 --> 00:20:02.576
the minute I heard that you guys were the detective squad,

360
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.376
I got scared.

361
00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:07.876
I see.

362
00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:09.076
What's there to be afraid of?

363
00:20:09.076 --> 00:20:10.676
An adult being afraid of a detective squad

364
00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.776
made up of a bunch of pip-squeak kids!

365
00:20:11.776 --> 00:20:14.876
If you had thought up sending them off to a hot spring trip,

366
00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:17.876
why didn't you carry it out in the first place?

367
00:20:19.776 --> 00:20:21.676
It would've been faster, cheaper and easier

368
00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:24.276
if you just gave them a voucher for a trip

369
00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:26.576
and send the whole family off, than to go out of your way,

370
00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:29.176
dish cash out of your own pocket, renovate the shop,

371
00:20:29.176 --> 00:20:31.476
and help it flourish!

372
00:20:31.476 --> 00:20:33.876
Oh, that's true.

373
00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:35.476
That's right.

374
00:20:37.076 --> 00:20:38.976
I guess so, now that you mentioned it.

375
00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:41.576
You guess so?

376
00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:43.576
It never even dawned on me.

377
00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.076
What?

378
00:20:46.676 --> 00:20:48.176
I guess the case is closed.

379
00:20:48.176 --> 00:20:49.976
Haibara?

380
00:20:49.976 --> 00:20:51.576
Convinced?

381
00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:54.376
Haibara.

382
00:20:54.376 --> 00:20:55.976
Didn't I tell you that

383
00:20:55.976 --> 00:20:59.976
the person you're dealing with this time is unsophisticated?

384
00:21:02.876 --> 00:21:05.276
They've come. I called them.

385
00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:07.676
I wonder if they'll award us with

386
00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:09.376
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Commissioner Award?

387
00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:11.176
It would be nice if they did.

388
00:21:11.176 --> 00:21:12.576
Sure would.

389
00:21:12.576 --> 00:21:14.276
I'm pretty sure they will.

390
00:21:14.276 --> 00:21:17.476
After all, you've carried out a fantastic good deed.

391
00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:18.776
Really?

392
00:21:18.776 --> 00:21:20.876
I suppose we did.

393
00:21:25.876 --> 00:21:26.976
I hate this.

394
00:21:26.976 --> 00:21:30.876
I don't feel a least bit good even after the case is solved.

395
00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:35.476
I hate it!

396
00:23:03.176 --> 00:23:05.276
We received a letter of thanks award from the police

397
00:23:05.276 --> 00:23:07.676
for cooperating in the arrest of a jewelry thief

398
00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:11.076
just before his duration of prescription was about to expire.

399
00:23:13.076 --> 00:23:14.476
We did it, didn't we?

400
00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:17.676
Yep. It was really easy this time.

401
00:23:17.676 --> 00:23:21.776
I've got something I'd like to tell you guys.

402
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:25.476
Not all the criminals are going to be a fool like this one.

403
00:23:25.476 --> 00:23:28.676
It's dangerous just barging in, just us kids.

404
00:23:28.676 --> 00:23:30.476
Be more careful next time, understand?

405
00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:35.276
Huh? You sure don't sound like your usual self, Conan.

406
00:23:35.776 --> 00:23:39.976
Conan, so you're that vexed that we got the upper hand this time?

407
00:23:39.976 --> 00:23:45.276
Genta. Don't talk like that because Conan is hurt.

408
00:23:46.276 --> 00:23:48.676
Conan, cheer up.

409
00:23:48.676 --> 00:23:52.376
I'm so sorry, Conan. That's a good boy.

410
00:23:52.376 --> 00:23:57.176
You idiot. I'm a specialist of decent crimes

411
00:23:57.176 --> 00:24:02.176
where brains clash against brains and emit sparks!

412
00:24:23.676 --> 00:24:26.576
He's dead?

413
00:24:28.276 --> 00:24:29.676
Next Conan,

414
00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:33.597
"Battle Game Trap (Part 1)"

415
00:24:33.694 --> 00:24:36.694
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:36.694 --> 00:24:38.594
"Game characters"

417
00:24:38.594 --> 00:24:40.194
Sonoko will appear in the next episode after a long absence.

418
00:24:40.194 --> 00:24:42.894
Hi, long time no see. I'm Sonoko.

419
00:24:42.894 --> 00:24:43.894
Who are you?
