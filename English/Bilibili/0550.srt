1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,240
We all went to eat sushi on Dr. Agasa's treat.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,040
And we landed up in a rotating sushi shop.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,540
Although Genta and the others didn't look all that satisfied,

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,940
they were soon all taken in by the attractiveness of rotating sushi

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,040
and started eating their favorite dish.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,840
But a customer named Mr. Agatsuma sitting next to us

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,240
started saying next nasty things to us

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,440
as well as the customers who were there,

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,740
and ended up picking on the shop manager, too.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,140
Upset over what had happened, just as we were about to leave,

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,340
Mr. Agatsuma suddenly started to suffer and collapsed.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,540
There was a slight smell of almond from his mouth.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,140
This is poisoning.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,940
The three people who were on bad terms

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,340
with Mr. Agatsuma are the suspects.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,640
Mr. Aizono, who in the past got into trouble with Mr. Agatsuma.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,540
Ms. Sakiko Takemura, whose shop was driven to bankruptcy

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,540
because of food writer Mr. Agatsuma's article.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,240
And Mr. Danji Namiki, a former sushi-maker who hurt his arm

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,140
after getting involved in a fight caused by Mr. Agatsuma.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,740
However, as a result of their body check,

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,040
none of them had any poison on them.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,340
Where on earth did the poison disappear to?

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,040
And, how did the killer target only Mr. Agatsuma

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,740
and make him pick up the poisoned plate?

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,040
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,340
An incident occurs at the rotating sushi shop!

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,240
Show time, Youth Detective Squad.

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:26,978
"Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 2)"

34
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:29,678
But I wonder. Is there a way

35
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:33,678
to make only Mr. Agatsuma pick up the poisoned plate?

36
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,278
That's right, he ordered it!

37
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:38,878
If he placed the order for the sushi,

38
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,878
he would pick it up for sure!

39
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:43,278
-Place an order? -Yes.

40
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,278
If you place an order using this touch panel,

41
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:48,678
the sushi comes in a bowl with the sign "ordered" on it,

42
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,978
and when it comes in front of you, there is beeping sound.

43
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,478
I see!

44
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,178
So, Ms. Takemura who was seated to the right of the victim

45
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,078
could've done it!

46
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:59,978
No way.

47
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:03,078
Even if an ordered plate were to come around,

48
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:05,078
I couldn't have smeared poison on it!

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,478
Because beyond him, there was a man who was wearing a cap,

50
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,878
I had no way of knowing which one of them had placed the order!

51
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:15,578
Besides, I can't even see the touch panel from my seat,

52
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:19,078
so I wasn't able to tell what he ordered.

53
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:21,878
The only one who could see it

54
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:24,778
was Mr. Aizono who was sitting next to him.

55
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:27,278
Hey, hold it, will you?

56
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,978
I mentioned it a while ago too,

57
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,378
but I was sitting to the left of Mr. Agatsuma,

58
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:34,778
and the sushi was rotating from right to left!

59
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,178
Even if I were to be able to see

60
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:39,478
what Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel,

61
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,478
the plate would be picked up by him before it reaches me!

62
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:45,078
True.

63
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:49,578
Besides, I'm not the only one who can see the touch panel.

64
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:52,078
The manager can too!

65
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:53,578
Because after arguing with Mr. Agatsuma

66
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:55,478
and up to the time Mr. Agatsuma collapsed,

67
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,778
he was standing behind him!

68
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:59,978
Is that true?

69
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:01,378
Yes.

70
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:04,178
Since Mr. Agatsuma was making such a racket,

71
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,278
I told him, "You don't have to pay, so please leave."

72
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:10,178
Then he said, "If it's free, I'll eat and leave."

73
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:12,178
So, I stood behind him

74
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,378
to watch that he wouldn't make further trouble.

75
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:18,178
Well, but as far as I saw,

76
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:21,078
he didn't seem to have been ordering anything.

77
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:25,278
We can tell for sure if I check the computer though.

78
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:27,778
-Check it. -Yes, sir.

79
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,478
Officer.

80
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:34,678
Haven't you forgotten?

81
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:37,278
You did a body check on us a while ago,

82
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:38,678
but no container with poison inside,

83
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:42,178
nor any handkerchief soaked with poison was found!

84
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:46,178
Despite of this, I question why you keep on suspecting us.

85
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,678
I'm sure that the killer

86
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:50,378
was among the customers that already left the shop.

87
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:53,678
Maybe that's why the container with poison inside wasn't found.

88
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:57,278
Which means unless we capture that killer,

89
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:02,078
we'll never find out how just Mr. Agatsuma was targeted.

90
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:05,178
Back off.

91
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,178
Inspector!

92
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,178
I checked the computer of the shop,

93
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:10,878
there was no order by Mr. Agatsuma.

94
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,678
Left.

95
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:17,878
Left?

96
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,378
I think that the man who died was left handed!

97
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,878
Because it was on the fingertip of the man's left hand!

98
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,478
The place where 2 or 3 rice grains were stuck on!

99
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,478
Come to think of it, I saw the man eating with his left hand!

100
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,078
Yes, yes, he picked up the sushi with his left hand!

101
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,678
I saw him, too!

102
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:39,478
I see. If he was left handed...

103
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,278
If most of the poison is smeared on to the left side facing the plate,

104
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,778
it seems possible to make only him touch the poison.

105
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:48,778
Yes.

106
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:53,478
Okay. Check all the plates on the conveyer belt

107
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:56,378
to see if there are any other plates with poison on them!

108
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:57,378
Yes, sir!

109
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:59,178
We're counting on you, forensics!

110
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,678
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

111
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:08,878
But I wonder if we're really right about it?

112
00:07:08,878 --> 00:07:10,078
If it were really true,

113
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:11,878
the killer would've had to smear the poison on after verifying that

114
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:16,278
Mr. Agatsuma is the only left-handed customer in this lane.

115
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:20,178
But if after that, a left-handed customer suddenly comes in, then what?

116
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:24,978
Besides, if it were to be a child instead of a left-handed customer.

117
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,378
Moreover, it's likely that the plate

118
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,278
would be picked up with both hands, too.

119
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:31,978
Where on earth did the poison disappear to in the first place?

120
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,778
This crime isn't possible unless a container with poison

121
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:39,078
or a cloth-like thing soaked with poison is found.

122
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,678
There's something by the tea cup of the seat

123
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,878
where Mr. Agatsuma was seated.

124
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,478
A piece of a vinyl wrapper.

125
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:50,278
Huh? If I'm not mistaken, this is...

126
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:55,978
Huh?

127
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,178
-Nothing was found? -Yeah.

128
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,978
Although there were many plates going around at the same time

129
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,778
that Mr. Agatsuma picked up the poisoned plate...

130
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:07,678
Weren't there any other plates with poison on them?

131
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,378
Not even one.

132
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:11,978
If so, the victim would've had to pick up

133
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:14,678
the only poisoned plate there was

134
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:18,478
as if he were under hypnosis or something.

135
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,478
Maybe there was a message or something on the plate?

136
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,678
Like, this is a present for you or something.

137
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:28,878
I would never pick up such a plate

138
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:30,578
because it's kind of creepy.

139
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,678
Well, a card's not thinkable.

140
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,078
Oh?

141
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,578
Because if it were so,

142
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:38,278
the man would've had a card on him.

143
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,678
I could care less, though.

144
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:44,378
I'm hungry!

145
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:47,478
You just ate a while ago!

146
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,278
That sushi...

147
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,478
Can't I eat it?

148
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:54,378
Of course not!

149
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:57,678
But you're going to throw it away anyway, right?

150
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,178
Don't you think it's a waste?

151
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:03,978
Yeah! That's it!

152
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:07,478
Ai, will you lend me your handkerchief?

153
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,378
I want to wipe my glasses.

154
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:13,078
Then, use the disposal hand wipes of this shop!

155
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:15,778
There were some by the entrance.

156
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:18,578
Wait a sec. That's...

157
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:23,778
I see.

158
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:27,078
It had to be sushi to carry this trick out!

159
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:30,078
Which means that the killer is that person.

160
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,178
The killer poisoned only Mr. Agatsuma

161
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:35,578
and set up a trick to get rid of the evidence

162
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:39,678
using this special system of rotating sushi.

163
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,978
A very clever trick!

164
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,078
Officer.

165
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:49,778
Are you still suspecting us?

166
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:55,378
I can understand you wanting to suspect us,

167
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,578
who had reasons for hating him.

168
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,478
But if the only plate that had poison on it

169
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:02,478
was the one that Mr. Agatsuma picked up,

170
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,878
I think it would've been impossible to target just him.

171
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:08,078
But it's true that you all

172
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,078
had a chance to smear poison on the plate, too.

173
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,878
Explain it to us, then!

174
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:16,278
How would you make that man

175
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,278
pick up the only poisoned plate there is?

176
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,578
Or? Are you saying that we look like some super ruthless killer

177
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:27,578
that would randomly kill anybody?

178
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:30,278
No, that's not it.

179
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:31,978
And even if we wanted to smear the plate with poison,

180
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:35,978
we didn't have any container with poison in it on us.

181
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:39,178
If we are the killer, we should have it on us, right?

182
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:40,678
From the time that man collapsed

183
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:43,478
to the time the police came and body checked us,

184
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:46,478
we didn't move from here at all!

185
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,478
Like I said a while ago,

186
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:52,978
I think the killer is one of the customers who already left the shop.

187
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:59,378
If so, it's understandable why no container with poison was found.

188
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:03,178
It seems that someone who just randomly wanted to kill,

189
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:05,378
left the poisoned plate behind

190
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:08,878
and Mr. Agatsuma unluckily happened to pick it up.

191
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:12,478
-That's... -He seems to have indeed been unlucky.

192
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:16,278
Using my voice without permission again.

193
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,478
But that's not about Mr. Agatsuma who was killed.

194
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,678
I'm talking about the killer that's in front of me

195
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:25,178
snickering that everything seems to have turned out well!

196
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:28,778
And I will show you how the killer put poison on Mr. Agatsuma's plate

197
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:34,478
as well as how the container with the poison disappeared.

198
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:37,078
I will disclose all this by a simple deduction

199
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,378
made by me, who just happened to be here.

200
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:42,978
So, the killer is among the people here after all?

201
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:46,678
Yes! Just as you, the police pointed out,

202
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,878
the killer is among the three here

203
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:51,278
who have a grudge against Mr. Agatsuma!

204
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,875
Hey, what's with you, anyway?

205
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,675
Suddenly butting in and blabbering!

206
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,175
Just because you're a bit stout,

207
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:15,475
acting like a big shot, like some detective or something!

208
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:17,375
Oh, well...

209
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,775
Size doesn't matter, anyway.

210
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:21,575
Did you see us do it or what?

211
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,975
Us smearing poison on that man's plate!

212
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:26,875
No, I didn't.

213
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,175
Then...

214
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,575
Well, of course I didn't

215
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,475
because the one who smeared poison on his plate

216
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,675
was Mr. Agatsuma himself.

217
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,075
What?

218
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:38,975
Doc, talk with confidence like a detective would.

219
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,975
But, Mr. Agasa.

220
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:42,575
If the one who smeared poison on the plate

221
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,775
was the one who was killed by the poison,

222
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,575
wouldn't that be suicide?

223
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:50,575
No. What I'm saying is the poison was not on the plate

224
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:54,675
but on something else that he touched before touching the plate!

225
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:58,875
That's why the poison was only on Mr. Agatsuma's plate!

226
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,175
But, just what is that something else?

227
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,475
What is it?

228
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,675
Hey, you guys!

229
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:09,675
Before the plate with what you want to eat comes around in front of you,

230
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,775
what do you touch before you pick up the plate?

231
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,475
Well...

232
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,475
First, I guess I'd take a pair of chopsticks.

233
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,575
Drink tea from the tea cup.

234
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,075
And pour soy sauce into my dish.

235
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:24,375
No, not what you touch before picking up the first plate,

236
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,375
but what you touch after eating several plates!

237
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,375
I'm pretty sure you touched it, Genta.

238
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,775
Huh? Me?

239
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,175
Conan.

240
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:35,575
We checked everything by Mr. Agatsuma's seat,

241
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:38,175
but there was no poison smeared anywhere.

242
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,075
So, even if Mr. Agatsuma were to have touched

243
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:42,175
before picked up his plate...

244
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:45,875
Then, what is there at Mitsuhiko's seat but not at Genta's?

245
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,675
He's not listening to me.

246
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:49,375
Uh...

247
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,675
Oh, chopsticks!

248
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:53,375
There are no chopsticks at Genta's seat!

249
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,775
Genta was eating picking up the sushi with his hands, that's why.

250
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,575
Dad used to tell me

251
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,075
people who's originally from the downtown district of Tokyo

252
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,975
should eat sushi with their hands!

253
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,575
If you were eating using your hands,

254
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,475
isn't there something that you'd want to touch?

255
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,575
Something I want to touch?

256
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,375
I licked my fingers.

257
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,675
Then, what did you do after licking your fingers?

258
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,475
After that, I...

259
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,275
I see. Hand wipes!

260
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,775
Because after touching the sushi and fish directly with the hands,

261
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:27,075
you would want to wipe of the oil of the fish, the water

262
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,175
and sticky vinegar rice from the hands.

263
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:33,875
Are you saying that the poison was on the hand wipe?

264
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,975
Right, Doc?

265
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,075
Yeah.

266
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:40,975
But there were no hand wipes at Mr. Agatsuma's seat.

267
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:44,275
But there are traces that there was, wasn't there?

268
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,475
This!

269
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:52,875
Right. Anybody can freely take it at the entrance of the shop.

270
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:57,275
It's the torn off piece of vinyl that the disposable was in!

271
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,675
This is it.

272
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,875
It's likely that the killer put poison

273
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:05,775
inside the vinyl package of the hand wipe

274
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,875
using a syringe or something.

275
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,475
I get it!

276
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,875
After he touched the poisoned hand wipe, he took the plate,

277
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,875
he picked up the sushi with his fingers, ate it and died.

278
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,475
That's why poison was found only on that plate!

279
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,675
Yeah, exactly!

280
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:28,275
But Mr. Agatsuma's been quite a lot before he was poisoned to death!

281
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,675
It's difficult to understand

282
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:32,875
why he didn't touch the poisoned hand wipe at all until then.

283
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,675
No, it was switched part way.

284
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:39,475
Most probably when the store manager was arguing with Mr. Agatsuma!

285
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:43,375
But, if somebody else were to stretch their hand over

286
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,675
and touch the hand wipe,

287
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,475
I'm sure that he would've noticed,

288
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,875
and say, "Just what do you think you're doing?"

289
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,875
What if the killer knew that

290
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:56,175
Mr. Agatsuma would put the hand wipe near him?

291
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:58,675
But where a person places the hand wipe depends on each and every person,

292
00:15:58,675 --> 00:15:59,775
in other words, it could be anywhere.

293
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:02,575
No, Mr. Agatsuma is left-handed.

294
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:06,175
If he'd been using the hand wipe each time he ate sushi,

295
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,375
it's only natural that he would put it on his left side, right?

296
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,575
Yes, it's the seat to the left of Mr. Agatsuma where you were seated...

297
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:15,275
Mr. Aizono!

298
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,875
He would put the hand wipe where you were seated!

299
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,275
If you put the hand wipe that you pretended

300
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:26,375
to be using right next to Mr. Agatsuma's,

301
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,375
it would be a cinch to switch it!

302
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,775
Just what do you think you're saying?

303
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,275
If so, where did it disappear to?

304
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,875
The hand wipe with the poison on it!

305
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,775
Did I have something like that on me, officer?

306
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:42,975
No. Although I did do a body check,

307
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,375
no such thing was found.

308
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,975
See!

309
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:48,475
If you're going to insist that I'm the killer,

310
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:52,075
first prove how the poisoned hand wipe disappeared.

311
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:56,175
It didn't disappear! It was naturally gotten rid of

312
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,575
by this rotating sushi system that gets rid of everything

313
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:02,375
when the time comes!

314
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,775
I get it! When the time comes at this rotating sushi shop,

315
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,175
the sushi that has been going around for some time

316
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,375
is automatically disposed of!

317
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,675
This system was taken advantage of!

318
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:13,675
Right! He probably did what he did

319
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:19,475
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed and everybody's attention was on him.

320
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:22,675
If the killer put the hand wipe that Mr. Agatsuma was originally using

321
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,775
inside the vinyl bag that had the poisoned hand wipe inside it,

322
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,275
wrapped it up and put it on the plate,

323
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:30,075
it would be difficult to make out from a distance

324
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:32,575
whether it is sushi on the plate or the hand wipe because both are white.

325
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:36,075
It's true that if you put the plate back on the belt conveyer,

326
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:38,775
it would automatically be disposed of,

327
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,675
but if you do something that is ill mannered

328
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:42,475
such as to return the plate that you once took,

329
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:45,075
someone is bound to have noticed and remembered.

330
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:48,875
Remember, no joke! Everybody was doing so!

331
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,975
Everybody?

332
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,875
Saying things like, "food poisoning"!

333
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,675
"Don't eat it."

334
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,975
"Put the plate back!"

335
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,275
Everybody was putting the plates back,

336
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,975
so no one said anything about it!

337
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,775
But the conveyer belt of this lane

338
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:05,575
-was stopped immediately, wasn't it? -Yes.

339
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:08,775
2 or 3 minutes after Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

340
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:12,075
It's unnatural that the sushi would so conveniently be disposed of

341
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:13,875
in such a short time, right?

342
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,675
It's true that if the plate were just picked up some time

343
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:19,575
would've had to pass before the plate would be disposed of,

344
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,775
but if the plate were switched with the first plate

345
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,775
that was taken after coming to the shop...

346
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:28,575
The device that read this mark

347
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,675
would mistakenly determine that the plate has been around for some time

348
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,975
and dispose of it right away, wouldn't it?

349
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,775
Where do the disposed sushi go?

350
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,975
Yes, sir. It goes to the garbage disposal.

351
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:45,975
Okay, check that garbage disposal!

352
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:49,075
The poisoned hand wipe and vinyl should be there!

353
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:50,575
Yes, sir!

354
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:55,775
Mr. Aizono. If your prints are found on that vinyl bag,

355
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:58,375
it would serve as conclusive evidence.

356
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,675
If you turn out to be the killer,

357
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,175
your motive is probably

358
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:09,875
the argument you had with Mr. Agatsuma before at this shop?

359
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,575
Yes.

360
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:15,575
If I remember correctly, he pointed out

361
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:19,175
you mistaking sea bass for flatfish in front of your wife.

362
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:22,475
Yes. Well, I happened to have a cold that day,

363
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,075
and couldn't really taste the fish.

364
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:27,675
It's only naturally that I made a mistake too

365
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:30,675
because just before that sea bass came to my seat,

366
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:33,975
it was switched and placed on a plate that had expensive flatfish on it.

367
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:36,575
Huh? It was switched?

368
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,075
That Agatsuma...

369
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:42,175
He got nasty with me who was explaining to my wife

370
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,375
and deliberately took the plate with the sea bass

371
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,375
and flatfish on it and switched them.

372
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:50,875
Even after that incident,

373
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:56,175
he wrote in nasty comments on my "gourmet walk" blog.

374
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,875
My wife used to tell me not to let him bother me,

375
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,875
but I couldn't forgive him!

376
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,875
I couldn't bear the fact that a rotten guy like him

377
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,575
was making a living as a food writer writing about food!

378
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:08,475
That's why you poisoned him to death?

379
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:13,775
Yes. Since then, I could never enjoy anything I ate.

380
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:17,275
I eventually divorced my wife, too.

381
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:20,975
All I liked to do was eat.

382
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:24,675
I was just happy watching my wife

383
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:28,075
enjoy eating at the shop that I recommended.

384
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,975
But that guy spoiled it all!

385
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,575
But, sir, do you know?

386
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:43,875
That you yourself, tarnished what you liked to do best.

387
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,275
With a deadly poison called murder

388
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:51,075
that cannot be wiped off no matter how hard you try.

389
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:59,375
After this, the vinyl bag in question

390
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,375
was found from the garbage disposal,

391
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,675
and the case was solved.

392
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:08,475
The sushi that stopped rotating would probably start rotating again.

393
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,275
But no more for a while.

394
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:15,275
I can't stand rotating sushi that reminds me of this sick incident.

395
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:38,975
Well, I really felt that

396
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:41,575
I wouldn't care for rotating sushi for a while, but...

397
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,475
It's delicious!

398
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:46,375
-This place is pretty good too, isn't it? -Yes!

399
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,975
We're addicted already!

400
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,875
Two eel plates for me!

401
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,375
Sushi is a cultural cuisine that Japan created

402
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,475
that can be boasted of worldwide!

403
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:56,875
Being Japanese, I can't help but wanting to eat it.

404
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:02,175
It seems that a rotating sushi shop is also going to open soon

405
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:03,375
in front of the station.

406
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,375
What? Really?

407
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,575
Let's have Doc take us there again too, then!

408
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:10,775
All right, sounds good!

409
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:12,075
Let's go! Let's go!

410
00:23:17,575 --> 00:23:19,775
It'll be 12,500 yen.

411
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:20,975
Huh?

412
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:24,075
You sure it's not a mistake?

413
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:27,175
That fruit parfait was good!

414
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:29,275
My pudding a-la-mode was good, too.

415
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:33,075
I ate all the dessert there were, but they were all good!

416
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:35,375
You parfaits and pudding too?

417
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:39,275
Yes, although they're a bit more expensive than the sushi.

418
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:42,575
Oh, right! I thought of something good!

419
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:46,775
Why don't we make Saturday sushi day?

420
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,975
-Sounds good! -I agree!

421
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,875
Okay, the Youth Detective Squad

422
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,375
will go around on Saturdays to sushi shops!

423
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,975
-Yeah! -Yeah!

424
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,175
Hey...

425
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,775
My head's spinning round!

426
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,175
It's because you got stingy to start with.

427
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:09,375
"Next Episode" -A contest of Kojimas nationwide?

428
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,175
That's 10,000,000!

429
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,475
You made it to the three finalists?

430
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,375
What on earth happened?

431
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:21,575
Hey... Don't tell me that the three finalists include...

432
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:28,075
Don't tell me that Genta's father

433
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,875
is also considered one of the suspects too?

434
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:35,974
Next Conan, "The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 1)"

435
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:54,454
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:56,554
"Mr. Kojima"

437
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:58,654
Genta's father makes an appearance in the next episode!

438
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:01,625
-Dad's not the culprit... -Let's find out next week about that.
