1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,890
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,640
a pop-up doll,
and broken ceramic!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,000
Mystery-solving logic is helpful
against people's dry hearts!

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,500
Today's a beautiful illustrator!
Her mischievous streak means death!

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,760
He sees the single truth for what it is,
and there's no outwitting him!

The Illustrator Murder Case

00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:43,559
Eh? A collection of
Hanaoka Design Office

00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,689
murder scene paintings?!
Hanaoka Design Office

10
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,889
I didn't tell you?
It's being released next month

11
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:54,189
by painter and president of this
design office, Hanaoka-sensei!

12
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:59,429
I asked both of you to come
today for an interview

13
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,309
to put at the end
of the collection...

14
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:04,199
Interview?

15
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,629
Is something wrong?

16
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,299
It's just that Dad said it was
a collection of paintings of him!

17
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:17,619
It seemed strange, huh?

18
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,259
Yeah!

19
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:22,459
So, where is this fancy painter?

20
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,759
He's still not here.

21
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,979
He could be asleep in his studio...

22
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,849
Gimme a break.

23
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,319
Beika Apartment Building â™ª2

24
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,419
What are you doing?

25
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,699
Oh, you woke up.

26
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,559
Painter - Kenjin Hanaoka (48)

27
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,289
What is this? Paint?
Painter - Kenjin Hanaoka (48)

00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,639
Illustrator - Izumi Chono (25)
Nail polish.

29
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,999
Isn't it a nice color?
lt went on sale today!
Illustrator - Izumi Chono (25)

30
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,809
Really, now...

31
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:51,959
Should you really be relaxing?

32
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,919
Aren't you supposed to meet
some detective at 5:00?

33
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,709
Oh no!

34
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,059
Hurry.

35
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:03,309
I put your pants
and socks on for you.

36
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:08,349
Don't pull that prank anymore!
If my wife were to see it-

37
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,059
That's why I did it.

38
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:14,899
That way she'd divorce you
and we could be together.

39
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,109
What was that for?!

40
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,829
I told you our relationship
is business only!

41
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,639
That's why you're able
to paint whatever you want

42
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,409
and live in such a fancy apartment!

43
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:31,579
I'll reveal the truth!

44
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:36,299
She's already vaguely suspicious.
But she overlooks it.

45
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,009
I don't mean us.
I mean the paintings.

46
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,639
Sixty percent of your paintings
were actually done by me.

47
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:48,429
Wait!

48
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:52,599
If word gets out, you can kiss
your reputation goodbye.

49
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,519
You won't be able to
sell a single painting.

50
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,279
Who'd ever believe
a new illustrator?!

51
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,619
Oh, you didn't know?
I clearly marked each one I drew.

52
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,579
What?!

53
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,039
The World of Kenjin Hanaoka

54
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,749
Take a good look beneath
your signature on the paintings I did.

55
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,549
This is--

56
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:25,969
I've placed that mark
on all of my original works.

57
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:32,019
Thanks to your increase in work,
they've become rather famous...

58
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,389
I stayed up all night
painting another.

59
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,479
Be sure to have it delivered
to the publisher later.

60
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,659
Try as you might,
there's no escape from me...

61
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,239
...for as long as you live.

62
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,909
He's late! It's already 5:30!

63
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,559
No luck. He's not at home,
and I get his machine at the studio.

64
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:59,309
Maybe Chono-kun's place?
Today was her deadline...

65
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,339
Chono?

66
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:06,389
A new illustrator.
She lives in that building right there.

67
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,019
Damn it! I didn't mean to kill her!

68
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,809
Hello, this is Chono.
I'm away at the moment.

69
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:26,409
Please leave your
message after the tone.

70
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:31,559
Hello. This is Tanaka
from Hanaoka Design.

71
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,219
Chono-kun. Are you there?

72
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,719
Hanaoka Design!

73
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,009
Hello? Hello?

74
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:42,799
Who is it?

75
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,719
A prank call.

76
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,429
What are you looking at,
Conan-kun?

77
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,389
That apartment's veranda.

78
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,139
Oh, my...

79
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,559
They left their mattress
out in the rain.

80
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,179
Ah. That's Chono-kun's apartment.

81
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,029
Guess she's asleep.

82
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:10,389
This is taking far too long!
Sorry, but I'm leaving.

83
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,409
Please, wait!

84
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,119
Mori-san!

85
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,789
Hanaoka-sensei!

86
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,479
Where were you?

87
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,099
Sorry about that.

88
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,009
I fell asleep in my studio...

89
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,469
Your studio? We called
there several times...

90
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,429
Yes, that's what woke me up...

91
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,889
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detective Mori!

92
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,059
Huh? What happened
to your fingernail?

93
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:37,849
My fingernail?

94
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,479
Is that nail polish?

95
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,239
Of course not! It's just paint!

96
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,989
Must've gotten it in my studio.

97
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,699
Oh, Tanaka-kun.
Chono-kun might call.

98
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,389
Transfer the call to me if she does.

99
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,099
Right!

100
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,809
Damn! Damn! Damn that woman!

101
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,149
Hanaoka Design!

102
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,759
Hello, this is Chono.

103
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,369
Oh, it's you! Just a second!

104
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,519
Sir! It's Chono-kun!

105
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,479
This is Hanaoka.
Are you feeling any better?

106
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,939
What? You're going to die?!

107
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,909
You're going to jump off the veranda?!

108
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,259
She jumped off!

109
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,589
The deceased is Izumi Chono,
25 years old.

110
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:58,849
Hanaoka-san. She was an illustrator
for your design firm, correct?

111
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,309
Yes. She was still new,
but she had a keen sense.

112
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,179
But on the phone she said she was
going to die since she had no talent...

113
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,779
...the next thing I knew,
she had jumped off the veranda...

114
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,989
And you all witnessed it?

115
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:17,739
Yes...

116
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:21,589
A contact lens?

117
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:24,579
Wait. Wasn't she--

118
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:31,509
With so many witnesses,
it must've been a suicide...

119
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,969
No! This was a murder!

120
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,559
I bet she was dead before she fell,

121
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,939
and that someone pushed her over!

122
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:44,899
In which case,
the most suspicious is...

123
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:48,319
...this man, who tried
to talk her out of suicide!

124
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,849
Could an accomplice have pushed her?!

125
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:57,059
No, there was no one
on the veranda when she fell.

126
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:03,709
Then how did he push her
off from so far away?!

127
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,169
Say, isn't this strange?

128
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,339
Look at her eyes.
She's wearing contacts.

129
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,719
What about it?

130
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,809
But she was wearing
glasses when she fell.

131
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:24,519
Who wears glasses when
they already have contacts in?

132
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:27,979
He has a point...

133
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:33,189
In other words, someone put her
glasses on before pushing her off?

134
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,159
Hold on!

135
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,369
Detective. You saw
her jump off for yourself.

136
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:43,829
There was nobody else
on the veranda at the time.

137
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,059
Chono

138
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,889
Oh? The door's unlocked...

139
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:59,259
A nail...

140
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,219
What's it doing here?

141
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,099
Alright, you!

142
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:07,309
Ran! Watch this kid!

143
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,269
So this is the veranda
she jumped off of...

144
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,059
Slippers, a cell phone,
and a broken flowerpot...

145
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,119
The flowerpot pieces
lead to the drain...

146
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,539
You know you shouldn't
sneak around alone!

147
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,499
A contact lens case.
I assume it's hers.

148
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:33,419
In which case,
those glasses are the issue...

149
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,379
She probably forgot she
was wearing contacts.

150
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:42,719
Let's search the place! If this was
a suicide, there might be a will!

151
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,259
Yes, sir!

152
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,229
What's with these pictures?

153
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:58,389
Those are photos she took
on a recent company trip.

154
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,239
She liked drawing on
people in their sleep.

155
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,909
It looks like they're
all the same pattern.

156
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:07,639
That's her signature.

157
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,309
The butterfly comes from
the 'cho' in her name,

158
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,919
and she always puts it on her art.

159
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,349
Her illustrations have
gotten popular lately...

160
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,759
No will in here either...

161
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:26,729
Inspector Megure. There was
nail polish on the floor.

162
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,559
I think that's the nail polish
that went on sale today.

163
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,689
Everyone at school talked
about its unique color.

164
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,899
Say, isn't that what's on this
sheet?

165
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,139
No question about it!

166
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,219
But she didn't have any
on her hands or feet.

167
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,869
The only person wearing
this color was...

168
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,789
...you, huh?

169
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,709
Is this true?

170
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,599
It just happened to be
paint of the same color!

171
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,169
I was working in my studio
until this morning.

172
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:01,099
He's the killer.
No question about it.

173
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:05,679
But he was in
the office when she fell.

174
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,849
And with us!

175
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:11,769
We're leaving now, Conan-kun!

176
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:15,439
No! Just a little longer--

177
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,399
Disinfecting solution!

178
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:22,679
That's odd. Judging from that case,
she had soft lenses!

179
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,369
There was only
disinfectant in the fridge.

180
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,829
Where's the saline solution?!

181
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:32,259
Inspector Megure.
We haven't found a will.

182
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,889
Maybe it wasn't a suicide?

183
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,289
Excuse me...

184
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,969
I'm a courier.

185
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:41,969
I forgot to leave a pick-up
receipt when I came earlier.

186
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,259
Earlier?

187
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,759
Around 6:30.

188
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,219
6:30?! That's when she jumped!

189
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,679
Did you see her then?!

190
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:55,219
No, I was told I could pick
it up just inside the doorway

191
00:12:55,219 --> 00:13:00,649
and to come at exactly 6:30.
I didn't actually meet anyone.

192
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,109
Here's today's pick-up receipt.

193
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:05,069
Hanaoka?!

194
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,139
It says you were the one
who requested the pick-up.

195
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,809
What's the deal?

196
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:18,669
A courier at exactly the same time
she dies-- seems fishy to me.

197
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:22,389
She told me over the phone
that she finished a painting

198
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:26,259
so I simply arranged for a
courier to deliver it to the editors.

199
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,059
She was tired and seemed odd,

200
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,229
so I made it so she wouldn't
have to wait on the courier.

201
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,729
Did anything seem odd
when you entered the apartment?

202
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,649
Now that you mention it,
the door slammed right open.

203
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,529
I had barely even touched it...

204
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,009
You sure she didn't do it?

205
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,219
I thought so myself,
but there was no one there.

206
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,149
A nail fell, that's all.

207
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:55,759
A nail?

208
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,499
Yeah. And then I heard
something in the back break.

209
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,959
Wait a minute!

210
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,459
Perfect! It's stuck on
part of the flowerpot!

211
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:25,739
I've figured it all out! With this trick,
it'd be possible to push her off

212
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,009
the veranda from even miles away!

213
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,953
I've figured out the killer's trick!

214
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:41,373
What're you doing?!
I thought you left!

215
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,793
Ow! Stupid mosquitoes!

216
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:52,383
And now I put this
Button Speaker on the old man...

217
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:55,343
Eh? You know who did it?!

218
00:14:56,383 --> 00:15:01,303
Yes. Chono-san didn't commit suicide.
She was murdered!

219
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,773
By you, Hanaoka-san!

220
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:10,233
Hold on, Mori-kun. You know
he couldn't have done it.

221
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:13,963
Yeah! He couldn't be the killer!

222
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:18,913
We were all in that office
when we saw the lady fall!

223
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:21,123
That's right!

224
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:24,833
Quiet! He most certainly
could have done it!

225
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,843
He just needed strong
fishing line and a nail!

226
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:31,303
Inspector Megure. Can you get some?

227
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,543
Yes...

228
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:36,513
And a soy sauce bottle
and hot coffee.

229
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:39,643
A soy sauce bottle and coffee?

230
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:43,433
We're heating the coffee at the moment,

231
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:46,093
but what are you trying to do here?

232
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:49,273
Please just humor me, if you would.

233
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:54,383
First, make a loop
that's long enough to go

234
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:58,283
from the veranda's railing
to the door and back.

235
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:03,553
Pull one end through the belt on
the mattress, which'll be our victim,

236
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:06,963
and then loop it around
the railing, from the top.

237
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:12,253
Then place that loop
around the flowerpot,

238
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:18,263
pull the line to the door while
keeping the flowerpot from falling,

239
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:22,433
and temporarily place the
other loop around the intercom.

240
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:28,393
Next, slide the victim along the
line and dangle her over the edge.

241
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:32,213
Naturally, he covered
the victim with the mattress.

242
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:35,863
It disguised the body,
like camouflage.

243
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:38,713
Lastly, close the door
on your way out,

244
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:42,053
remove the loop around
the intercom, and tie it to the nail.

245
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:47,253
Stop the nail outside
the door, and it's all set.

246
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:52,383
I see. Once someone opens the door,

247
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:57,253
one end comes undone and
the victim falls by herself.

248
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:02,093
The door opener was
Hanaoka-san's courier, of course.

249
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:07,563
He would open the door at
whatever time he was asked to.

250
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:14,213
Interesting theory, but I don't
see any fishing line at all--

251
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,533
It's simple.

252
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,523
What?!

253
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:22,493
With extra line and a soy sauce bottle,
it disappears like magic.

254
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:27,623
First, you tie the extra line
between the victim and flowerpot,

255
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:31,633
pull the other end through
the inner and outer drain caps,

256
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,053
and tie it to the soy sauce bottle.

257
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,843
Then you simply place the
bottle and the caps into the drain.

258
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:43,343
The bottle is just a weight;
anything will do.

259
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:48,723
The saline solution missing
from the refrigerator, for example.

260
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:56,213
Seeing is believing...
Let us open the door...

261
00:17:56,213 --> 00:18:00,233
...the door of fate that
will solve this mystery!

262
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,553
It went in!

263
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,663
Check the drain at once!

264
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:17,173
Inspector! We already found
fishing line and the saline solution!

265
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:21,753
Ridiculous! I was on the phone
with her just before she fell!

266
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:24,253
She's the one who called me!

267
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:28,143
Try redialing the office
with the phone on the veranda!

268
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,103
It probably would connect.

269
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:38,563
Because you used it to call the office
after preparing the previous trick.

270
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:42,553
And the voice that Tanaka-san
heard was probably

271
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:48,323
part of the message on the
answering machine in your studio.

272
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:52,553
On your way from here to the office,
you stopped by your studio,

273
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:56,713
and took the tape
with her voice on it.

274
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,713
At the office, you went
straight to the restroom

275
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:05,013
and called the office
from your own cell phone.

276
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,473
Hello, this is Chono.

277
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:10,673
After taking the call from
Tanaka-san,

278
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:13,813
you diverted everyone's
attention to the opposite veranda

279
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:19,623
to make it appear that the
dead woman committed suicide.

280
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:27,553
The murder weapon was most
likely the ashtray beneath the desk.

281
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:31,073
If you test it, it should
produce a luminol reaction.

282
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:37,753
Still, do you have any
proof that I killed her here?

283
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:43,253
I certainly doubt it.
After all, today is my first time here.

284
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,713
Detective Mori.
Here's the hot coffee.

285
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:48,133
Well, Detective?

286
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,683
I'll take it to him!

287
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,803
At any rate, I'm innocent!

288
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,383
Oh? What's that?

289
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:02,943
What the...

290
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:06,403
Isn't that Chono-san's signature?!

291
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:14,373
That's right. She drew it with
nail polish while he was asleep.

292
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:17,583
But how did you know about that?

293
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,753
There was nail polish on the bed,
yet she had none on

294
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:26,053
while Hanaoka-san
had some on his finger.

295
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:31,173
And that nail polish
went on sale today.

296
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:33,683
If you're innocent,
then answer this.

297
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:37,753
When and where did you get
that mark, and from whom?

298
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:42,383
It isn't true, is it,
Hanaoka-san?

299
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:45,153
I can't believe you
would kill Chono-kun...

300
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:48,613
His motive for murder was
probably his paintings.

301
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:52,553
Chono-san's signature
appeared many times

302
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,203
beneath his own in his art album.

303
00:20:55,553 --> 00:21:00,863
Those were probably works
that she made using his style.

304
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,083
That became a point of contention...

305
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,253
Yes! It's exactly as you say!

306
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:09,803
I snapped, and when
I came to, I had killed her!

307
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:14,473
But that might not have
been the only reason.

308
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:18,963
I was scared.
Scared of her young talent!

309
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:23,213
She was a kind and beautiful girl...

310
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:26,423
Almost like the butterfly
that flutters around flowers!

311
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:29,443
But she soon dominated those flowers

312
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:33,423
and started killing them by
sucking away too much nectar!

313
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:38,343
So I plucked her wings so
she could no longer fly!

314
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:12,633
Eh? You want to use
Dad in a commercial?!

315
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:14,843
I'll put him on right now!

316
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:18,683
This is the great
detective Kogoro Mori!

317
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:22,893
Dad's really popular! An art
album and then a commercial!

318
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:25,423
Darn it! He always gets the glory!

319
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:29,603
Hell, no! I'd never be
in such a commercial!

320
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,223
What kind of commercial was it?

321
00:23:33,223 --> 00:23:35,313
One for sleeping pills!

322
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,953
Said all I had to do
was sleep! What nerve!

323
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:41,593
What do you mean?
That's perfect for you!

324
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,083
Is that gasoline I smell?!

325
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:56,133
Why the old man?
Does it have to do with the ghost ship?

326
00:23:56,463 --> 00:24:01,853
No self-respecting detective
would ever flee from danger!

327
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:07,733
Why me?!

328
00:24:08,423 --> 00:24:09,713
On the next Conan--

329
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,673
The Ghost Ship Murder Case (Part 1).

330
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,428
Next Conan's Hint:

331
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:16,430
Next Conan's Hint:
Telescope.

332
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,729
Telescope.
