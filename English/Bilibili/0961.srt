1
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.700
Wow!

2
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.390
This is called glamping
instead of camping, isn't it?

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.290
So you already know all about it.

4
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.960
It was on TV the other day.

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.970
Glamping is what you call camping
in elegance and comfort.

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.100
Ran, let's have a ton of fun today.

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.850
Yeah.

8
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.480
I'm glad we only had to
bring a change of clothes.

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.360
With camping, you have to
bring a bunch of equipment.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.240
Then we'd have to bring my dad.

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.780
What is he, your bag carrier?

12
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.870
I'm taking the picture.

13
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.870
Yeah!

14
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.750
Did you get it?

15
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.540
Conan-kun, over here.

16
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.010
Oh, coming!

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.800
Looks good.

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.970
Let me see.

19
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.800
Right now at this moment,
light pierces the darkness!

20
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.730
Overcome all limits with
your cool reasoning skills!

21
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.680
Opulent camping and four curious strangers.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.480
What will happen during their luxurious meal?

23
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.210
Always determining the one truth

24
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.080
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

25
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.610
his name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:09.827
The Glamping Mystery

27
00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:11.897
"The Glamping Mystery!"
The Glamping Mystery

28
00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.917
The Glamping Mystery

29
00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:19.297
It's huge.

30
00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:20.347
Yeah.

31
00:03:20.347 --> 00:03:21.747
Hooray!

32
00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:24.137
The beds are so fluffy.

33
00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:25.847
Now let's have fun!

34
00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:27.167
Yeah!

35
00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.487
Let's eat.

36
00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:42.307
What a luxurious dinner.

37
00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:46.747
It's delicious.

38
00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:50.997
I know. I can't believe that this is camping.

39
00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.127
It's not. It's glamping.

40
00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:56.627
What, kid? You're complaining
when we brought you along?

41
00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:58.407
Sorry.

42
00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:05.387
Here you go.

43
00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:08.177
How considerate.

44
00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:11.897
Ran-neechan made chocolate cookies.

45
00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:16.827
It's pretty.

46
00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:34.837
What is this?

47
00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.547
What is this? Is this a joke?

48
00:04:38.907 --> 00:04:42.677
He's dressed like a woman, has
sloppy scribbles on his face,

49
00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:46.957
a crab leg in his mouth,
and a note in his hand.

50
00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:48.227
Ran-neechan, call an ambulance.

51
00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:49.967
And the police.

52
00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:51.287
Okay.

53
00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:55.457
Hello? Please come immediately.

54
00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:57.647
We're at the Okuhoku Glamping Park.

55
00:04:58.737 --> 00:04:59.907
He's dead.

56
00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.157
Tosaki-san?

57
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.767
What on earth happened?

58
00:05:04.497 --> 00:05:05.617
Honey...

59
00:05:08.797 --> 00:05:10.607
How did this happen?

60
00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:13.417
I didn't do this.

61
00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:16.797
There's more.

62
00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:19.837
Did you know him?

63
00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:20.897
What?

64
00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:24.437
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

65
00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:27.217
H-He's my husband.

66
00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:30.577
Did you do something to this person?

67
00:05:30.577 --> 00:05:32.517
Well...

68
00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:36.357
I'm sorry! I just scribbled on his face...

69
00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:37.687
But I didn't kill him!

70
00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:39.527
Tanabe-san, you, too?

71
00:05:39.747 --> 00:05:40.567
"Too?"

72
00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.837
Which means you did something, too?

73
00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:43.567
What?

74
00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:44.247
Tosaki Keidai (46)

75
00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.157

82
00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:57.017
He's the president of a small company.

83
00:05:57.017 --> 00:05:59.567
We came here today with Miura-san

84
00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:04.717
to eat the cooking of my husband's
friend and chef Tanabe-san.

85
00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:05.757
I'm Tanabe Hiroshi.

86

89
00:06:10.357 --> 00:06:14.247
President Tosaki has been a
regular here for a long time.

90
00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:15.147
I'm Miura Mika.

I'm a makeup artist.

94
00:06:19.227 --> 00:06:22.917
I worked with Tosaki-san the other day.

95
00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.097
I did makeup for some promotional photos.

96
00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:27.867
He really liked my work,

97
00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:32.367
so he invited me here today as a reward.

98
00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:36.037
He was having so much fun this afternoon.

99
00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:37.747
Look, we have photos.

100
00:06:38.027 --> 00:06:40.227
We took all of these.

101
00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:45.387
We went canoeing, had Chef Tanabe's
special barbecue for lunch,

102
00:06:45.807 --> 00:06:49.507
and relaxed with tea and
snacks from Miura-san.

103
00:06:50.027 --> 00:06:53.767
How did this happen to your husband?

104
00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:55.387
I don't know.

105
00:06:55.837 --> 00:06:59.887
I stepped away from our
room, and when I returned...

106
00:07:00.977 --> 00:07:02.277
Honey?

107
00:07:02.577 --> 00:07:08.027
I tried to scream, but
then I noticed something.

108
00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:09.427
What was it?

109
00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:13.647
At this rate, I thought I might be blamed.

110
00:07:13.647 --> 00:07:14.677
What?

111
00:07:14.677 --> 00:07:17.537
So I decided to make it look like
someone else was responsible.

112
00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:19.917
Seriously?

113
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.297
I moved him to Tanabe-san's room.

114
00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:28.927
Since I was there, I stuck a crab leg in
his mouth so it would look like he did it.

115
00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:31.177
That should do it.

116
00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:32.847
How could you do that?

117
00:07:32.847 --> 00:07:35.557
You're the one who left
that corpse in my room?

118
00:07:36.007 --> 00:07:37.227
Yeah, but...

119
00:07:37.227 --> 00:07:38.597
But what?

120
00:07:38.597 --> 00:07:39.897
Now, now.

121
00:07:39.897 --> 00:07:43.067
Why did you put a crab leg in his mouth?

122
00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:48.857
Because Tanabe-san is a chef,
and it was in his freezer.

123
00:07:48.857 --> 00:07:52.327
I thought the chef would be
suspected if he had food on him.

124
00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:53.917
She manhandled his body.
Seriously?

125
00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:54.907
She manhandled his body.

126
00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.707
Tanabe-san, what did you do?

127
00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:59.707
Who, me? I...

128
00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:03.207
When I returned to my room,
I found Tosaki-san's body.

129
00:08:03.707 --> 00:08:06.217
For some reason, he had
a crab leg in his mouth.

130
00:08:06.517 --> 00:08:10.287
I thought about calling someone,
but then I realized something.

131
00:08:10.287 --> 00:08:13.597
At this rate, I might be blamed.

132
00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:19.807
So I decided to frame the girl with
glasses who came with Tosaki-san.

133
00:08:20.547 --> 00:08:22.937
And you call yourself human?

134
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:24.607
Calm down.

135
00:08:24.897 --> 00:08:26.097
And then?

136
00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:30.357
She said she worked with makeup,

137
00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:32.377
so I took a pen...

138
00:08:32.377 --> 00:08:34.467
And drew on his face.

139
00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:35.617
It's makeup!

140
00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:38.577
You don't respect my job, do you?

141
00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:39.747
Doesn't sound like it.

142
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:43.747
Then you moved Tosaki-san
to Miura-san's tent.

143
00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:44.657
Yeah.

144
00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:45.927
You're awful.

145
00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:47.327
What about you, Miura-san?

146
00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.757
What? Oh, I...

147
00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:52.097
When I returned to my tent,

148
00:08:52.097 --> 00:08:56.267
I found Tosaki-san's body with a crab leg
in his mouth and scribbles on his face.

149
00:08:56.617 --> 00:09:02.267
I thought about screaming, but at
this rate, I thought I'd be blamed.

150
00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:04.267
My wife did it

151
00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:07.777
I wrote a dying message
saying, "My wife did it."

152
00:09:08.087 --> 00:09:13.157
I put the note in his hand and
tried to carry him to his tent,

153
00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:16.627
but he was too heavy, so I got
tired and left him in the open.

154
00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:19.437
If you're gonna do something, see it through.

155
00:09:19.437 --> 00:09:22.247
Why did you say I did it?

156
00:09:22.247 --> 00:09:24.077
I didn't mean any harm.

157
00:09:24.077 --> 00:09:28.337
It's just, you know, usually it's the wife.

158
00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:29.617
What?!

159
00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:31.437
I've had enough from you!
More manhandling.

160
00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:32.737
I don't want to be blamed either!

161
00:09:32.737 --> 00:09:33.597
Now, now.
I don't want to be blamed either!

162
00:09:33.597 --> 00:09:34.367
Now, now.

163
00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:36.177
Someone died, you know.

164
00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:39.427
What? You've got the worst
character out of all of us!

165
00:09:39.607 --> 00:09:41.897
Although you're pretty bad, too.

166
00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:43.507
What was that?

167
00:09:43.507 --> 00:09:44.687
That's enough!

168
00:09:45.587 --> 00:09:47.437
I'm Megure from the MPD.

169
00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:50.187
You're involved in this case?

170
00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:52.927
Inspector Megure, Detective Takagi.

171
00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:58.457
Conan-kun. You're always
getting caught up in cases.

172
00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:04.417
Why don't you tell us what happened?

173
00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:10.457
I see. I get the picture.

174
00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:13.967
Is there anything else you noticed?

175
00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:16.677
Anything I noticed?

176
00:10:16.957 --> 00:10:20.127
Ma'am, why did you put
a crab leg in his mouth?

177
00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:25.167
Oh, that? The truth is my
husband was allergic to crab.

178
00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:26.687
Allergic to crab?

179
00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:31.247
He once accidentally ate
a dish containing crab.

180
00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:33.697
He narrowly escaped death.

181
00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:37.947
Since then, he didn't even
like to look at crab.

182
00:10:38.157 --> 00:10:39.417
Was that...

183
00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:41.027
Anaphylactic shock?

184
00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:42.827
Anaphylactic...?

185
00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:48.327
Dozens of people die every
year from anaphylactic shock.

186
00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:51.607
If first aid is administered
immediately, they can be saved,

187
00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:54.327
but if untreated, it can be fatal.

188
00:10:54.327 --> 00:10:55.587
Huh.

189
00:10:55.767 --> 00:10:58.857
Did anyone else know about that?

190
00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:01.137
Yes, Tanabe-san would have.

191
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.987
Yeah, I knew.

192
00:11:03.987 --> 00:11:08.107
The campground and Tosaki-san
told me not to use crab.

193
00:11:08.297 --> 00:11:13.087
I see. So you and the wife knew.

194
00:11:13.087 --> 00:11:17.417
Why didn't you mention his
allergy when you saw the crab?

195
00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:20.547
Because nobody asked me!

196
00:11:21.207 --> 00:11:26.497
Was that vile woman really
trying to frame me?

197
00:11:26.497 --> 00:11:30.877
It's hard to know what the wife was thinking.

198
00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:33.107
Hey, did you know?

199
00:11:33.557 --> 00:11:36.377
Those two were an awful couple.

200
00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:37.697
What?

201
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:41.147
Publicly they acted like
a happily married couple,

202
00:11:41.147 --> 00:11:43.887
but behind the scenes
they fought quite a lot.

203
00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:48.237
The wife was pretty bad, but the
husband was a scoundrel, too.

204
00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:53.007
Maybe that young woman was
the president's mistress.

205
00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.467
Y-You can't be serious!

206
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.527
Why would I do that?

207
00:12:00.477 --> 00:12:04.277
Tosaki-san just liked my work.

208
00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.537
That's really all it was.

209
00:12:06.537 --> 00:12:10.537
Wait! Is there anything else you noticed?

210
00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:12.057
No.

211
00:12:13.097 --> 00:12:17.547
Based on their testimony, all
three seemed to have motive.

212
00:12:18.497 --> 00:12:22.017
If their relationship was
as rocky as Tanabe-san said,

213
00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:23.927
Kyoko-san has motive.

214
00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:30.957
But Tanabe-san said nothing until now even
though he knew Tosaki-san was allergic to crab.

215
00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:34.887
And if Tanabe-san's deduction is right,

216
00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:40.027
then it makes sense that Miura-san
tried to frame Kyoko-san.

217
00:12:40.747 --> 00:12:46.037
But the only thing that's
certain is that someone is lying.

218
00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:51.457
Good evening, forensics.

219
00:12:51.457 --> 00:12:54.037
Ah, you're Mori-san's kid.

220
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:58.997
Did this person experience
anaphylactic shock?

221
00:12:58.997 --> 00:12:59.887
Yeah.

222
00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:02.677
We haven't investigated it thoroughly yet,

223
00:13:03.107 --> 00:13:06.117
but his expression, the
scratches on his neck,

224
00:13:06.117 --> 00:13:08.927
and the swelling around his mouth

225
00:13:08.927 --> 00:13:12.657
indicate it's likely he suffocated
from anaphylactic shock.

226
00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:13.727
I see.

227
00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:16.737
Anyway, I'm surprised you know that word.

228
00:13:16.737 --> 00:13:18.937
Kogoro-no-ojisan taught it to me.

229
00:13:20.137 --> 00:13:21.067
Thank you.

230
00:13:21.937 --> 00:13:25.577
It's almost certain he suffocated
from anaphylactic shock.

231
00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:27.357
Which means...

232
00:13:36.217 --> 00:13:38.417
If my deduction is right...

233
00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.317
Found it.

234
00:13:45.177 --> 00:13:47.367
How long are they going to make us wait?

235
00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:51.597
Conan-kun, you were in the bathroom a while.

236
00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.197
Do you have a stomachache?

237
00:13:53.197 --> 00:13:54.437
I'm fine.

238
00:13:55.187 --> 00:13:56.187
Hey, ma'am.

239
00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:58.607
Ma'am?

240
00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:01.247
I mean, miss?

241
00:14:01.247 --> 00:14:03.807
Could you show me those photos from earlier?

242
00:14:03.807 --> 00:14:05.487
Sure.

243
00:14:06.257 --> 00:14:07.737
Here you go.

244
00:14:11.657 --> 00:14:13.227
I'm gonna borrow this, ma'am.

245
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.497
I'm not a ma'am!

246
00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:16.987
Hey, Ran-neechan.

247
00:14:16.987 --> 00:14:20.007
Conan-kun, you should call her "miss."

248
00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:22.047
Could you do me a favor?

249
00:14:29.497 --> 00:14:32.027
Now I'm ready to go.

250
00:14:33.077 --> 00:14:35.947
All that's left is to corner the culprit.

251
00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:48.374
Excuse me, but how long
do we have to stay here?

252
00:14:48.774 --> 00:14:51.754
I've got work first thing tomorrow morning.

253
00:14:51.754 --> 00:14:54.714
It's not like we can stay here anymore.

254
00:14:54.714 --> 00:14:57.124
I'd like to get ready to leave.

255
00:14:57.554 --> 00:14:59.484
I'm going to get cold.

256
00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:02.424
My skin will be ruined...

257
00:15:02.424 --> 00:15:05.634
If you can't determine the truth,
there's no point in us staying here.

258
00:15:06.064 --> 00:15:08.964
It can't be helped. We'll stop for today.

259
00:15:08.964 --> 00:15:10.394
Wait!

260
00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:12.914
Wh-What?

261
00:15:12.914 --> 00:15:13.894
Inspector Megure,

262
00:15:14.274 --> 00:15:15.794
I've solved the mystery.

263
00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:18.404
Would you mind if I explained it here?

264
00:15:18.624 --> 00:15:19.354
What?

265
00:15:19.354 --> 00:15:22.254
Sonoko-san, you can't just...

266
00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.654
Very well. Let's hear what
Sonoko-kun has to say.

267
00:15:26.014 --> 00:15:27.404
Thank you.

268
00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:32.284
This case was supposed to be a simple murder.

269
00:15:32.284 --> 00:15:35.294
However, the irresponsible people here

270
00:15:35.294 --> 00:15:38.924
turned it into a bizarre
and complicated matter.

271
00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:42.444
Everyone avoided suspicion
falling upon themselves

272
00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:45.114
and framed someone else.

273
00:15:45.804 --> 00:15:48.464
The wife Kyoko-san put crab in his mouth,

274
00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:51.154
the chef Tanabe-san scribbled on his face,

275
00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:54.434
and Miura-san left a dying message.

276
00:15:55.034 --> 00:15:59.194
Furthermore, each one of them abandoned
the body in another suspect's room.

277
00:15:59.954 --> 00:16:03.114
Detective Takagi, have you
determined the cause of death?

278
00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:06.574
Yes. After examining the body
based on their testimony,

279
00:16:06.754 --> 00:16:12.054
it was determined that he suffocated due to
anaphylactic shock caused by some crab he ate.

280
00:16:12.544 --> 00:16:15.584
If he experienced anaphylactic shock,

281
00:16:15.914 --> 00:16:19.304
then the culprit had to have
known about his condition.

282
00:16:19.304 --> 00:16:20.714
You can't be serious!

283
00:16:20.714 --> 00:16:23.614
I'm the one who told the
police about the crab!

284
00:16:23.614 --> 00:16:27.594
And I didn't put crab in
any of Tosaki-san's food!

285
00:16:28.134 --> 00:16:29.424
As you can see,

286
00:16:29.424 --> 00:16:32.764
killing Tosaki-san using his
allergy causes the two of you

287
00:16:32.764 --> 00:16:35.124
to immediately fall under suspicion.

288
00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:36.354
You mean...

289
00:16:36.614 --> 00:16:37.534
Yes.

290
00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:41.244
The person who was certain they
wouldn't be suspected is the culprit.

291
00:16:41.774 --> 00:16:42.734
In other words,

292
00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:47.614
the person who used Tosaki-san's
crab allergy to kill him

293
00:16:48.204 --> 00:16:50.494
was you, Miura-san.

294
00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:56.304
You must've been shocked
when the body you abandoned

295
00:16:56.304 --> 00:16:59.164
came back to you, Miura-san.

296
00:16:59.164 --> 00:17:01.694
I-I didn't do anything.

297
00:17:01.694 --> 00:17:06.384
Like I said before, I just met
Tosaki-san through work the other day.

298
00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.034
Very well.

299
00:17:08.034 --> 00:17:11.384
Let's begin by examining how you killed him.

300
00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:17.554
Everyone, how would you feed crab
to a person with a crab allergy?

301
00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:18.874
That's it.

302
00:17:18.874 --> 00:17:24.154
A person with an allergy would be
careful to never eat that ingredient.

303
00:17:24.594 --> 00:17:29.204
That's why you mixed it
into the cookie dough.

304
00:17:31.004 --> 00:17:32.824
Inspector Megure, here.

305
00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:33.664
What's this?

306
00:17:33.964 --> 00:17:37.074
It's a picture taken while
they were eating lunch.

307
00:17:40.924 --> 00:17:43.584
Those are cookies. You can see them clearly.

308
00:17:44.754 --> 00:17:48.514
Miura-san, didn't you bake
these cookies yourself?

309
00:17:48.514 --> 00:17:49.844
Yes.

310
00:17:49.844 --> 00:17:55.224
Tosaki-san was supposed to die
then after eating the cookies.

311
00:17:55.594 --> 00:17:59.694
Even if crab was discovered in the cookies,

312
00:17:59.694 --> 00:18:03.934
as long as you claimed not to know about his
allergy, it would be treated as an accident.

313
00:18:05.714 --> 00:18:10.354
But things didn't go as
planned, and he didn't die.

314
00:18:10.354 --> 00:18:11.784
Why is that?

315
00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:16.294
Ma'am, did you remember something?

316
00:18:16.294 --> 00:18:19.124
They were a bit bitter.

317
00:18:19.684 --> 00:18:21.474
It's not unreasonable.

318
00:18:21.474 --> 00:18:27.884
You needed to use plenty of cacao to
mask the smell and flavor of crab.

319
00:18:28.104 --> 00:18:32.384
Tosaki-san probably chose
not to eat the cookies

320
00:18:32.624 --> 00:18:35.134
after he saw the expression of
Kyoko-san, who ate one first.

321
00:18:35.134 --> 00:18:38.394
That's why you called
Tosaki-san to your own tent

322
00:18:39.194 --> 00:18:41.194
and made him eat the cookies.

323
00:18:48.804 --> 00:18:54.564
Knowing you'd be suspected and
their connection might be doubted,

324
00:18:54.564 --> 00:18:59.034
you abandoned Tosaki-san in his tent.

325
00:18:59.394 --> 00:19:04.294
After that, as you all know, the
victim's body was passed around.

326
00:19:06.394 --> 00:19:08.424
Impressive reasoning.

327
00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:10.884
But you fell one step short.

328
00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:13.924
There's something crucial
lacking from your deduction.

329
00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:15.344
What do you mean?

330
00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:19.604
Physical evidence. Where
are these crab cookies?

331
00:19:19.814 --> 00:19:23.664
Unfortunately, I ate all the
cookies from this afternoon.

332
00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.864
Ran, do you have the cookies?

333
00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:27.104
Y-Yeah.

334
00:19:28.414 --> 00:19:29.104
What?

335
00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.684
I-Impossible!

336
00:19:30.684 --> 00:19:34.254
Those are the cookies you
offered this afternoon to—

337
00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:37.234
Wait!

338
00:19:39.874 --> 00:19:41.534
Now the evidence is—

339
00:19:42.434 --> 00:19:43.544
They're not bitter?

340
00:19:44.944 --> 00:19:46.044
Wh-What's that?

341
00:19:46.384 --> 00:19:49.874
Cookie fragments found in your room.

342
00:19:49.874 --> 00:19:55.464
What you ate were the chocolate
cookies I happened to bake and bring.

343
00:19:55.684 --> 00:20:00.724
If the investigation continues, I'm sure your
relationship with Tosaki-san will be established.

344
00:20:01.014 --> 00:20:05.524
And if they examine those
pieces of cookie, I'm sure...

345
00:20:07.704 --> 00:20:10.234
I lost.

346
00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:15.064
At first, we were just playing with fire.

347
00:20:15.584 --> 00:20:16.234
But...

348
00:20:17.204 --> 00:20:20.744
At some point, we needed each other.

349
00:20:21.124 --> 00:20:25.074
He said he'd leave his wife to be with me.

350
00:20:25.874 --> 00:20:30.154
We were happy until that day.

351
00:20:30.754 --> 00:20:33.554
Keidai, have some. Come on.

352
00:20:33.554 --> 00:20:37.214
Sorry. I'm allergic.

353
00:20:37.214 --> 00:20:39.764
A little won't hurt.

354
00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:42.154
I really can't.

355
00:20:42.814 --> 00:20:46.774
What's wrong with you?
I'm trying to feed you.

356
00:20:47.984 --> 00:20:50.314
I'm serious! Are you trying to kill me?

357
00:20:50.774 --> 00:20:53.284
I don't have time for you!

358
00:20:53.284 --> 00:20:58.634
After that, I apologized and
asked to get back together,

359
00:20:58.634 --> 00:21:01.174
but Keidai refused.

360
00:21:01.784 --> 00:21:08.294
So I asked him to take me
glamping with his wife instead.

361
00:21:08.294 --> 00:21:10.584
Miura-san, were you...?

362
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:14.684
That's right. I made a plan.

363
00:21:14.684 --> 00:21:19.154
I was going to kill him and
ruin you and your company

364
00:21:19.914 --> 00:21:23.334
using the crab that tore us apart!

365
00:21:25.054 --> 00:21:26.614
Miura Mika-san.

366
00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:30.854
You can tell us more at the station.

367
00:21:36.784 --> 00:21:39.744
Case closed.

368
00:21:39.744 --> 00:21:42.534
And we've been cleared of suspicion.

369
00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:43.874
Hold on.

370
00:21:43.874 --> 00:21:45.914
You're guilty as well.

371
00:21:45.914 --> 00:21:46.624
What?

372
00:21:47.564 --> 00:21:50.634
Tanabe Hiroshi-san, Tosaki Kyoko-san.

373
00:21:50.634 --> 00:21:55.264
We'd like to question you regarding
the body you abandoned.

374
00:21:55.264 --> 00:21:56.794
What?!

375
00:21:58.424 --> 00:21:59.934
Well, yeah.

376
00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:27.484
So good!

377
00:23:27.484 --> 00:23:29.244
I can't believe she used the crab like that.

378
00:23:29.244 --> 00:23:31.544
The crab's innocent.

379
00:23:33.074 --> 00:23:34.934
What is it, Conan-kun?

380
00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:41.864
They must've really hated the
victim to do all of that to him.

381
00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:46.314
It was a scary case.

382
00:23:46.314 --> 00:23:47.364
Yeah.
