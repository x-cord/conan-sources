1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,140
Today's case is about poisonous spiders!

2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,940
Vertical strings and horizontal strings. The locked room trick.

3
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,740
Open a hole in the tangled mystery!

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,940
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:59,625
Come on, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi!

8
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,225
Hurry up!

9
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,725
Let's play soccer.

10
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,325
Let's do so after we go to the library.

11
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,925
New books have come in yesterday.

12
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:13,725
Shoots, I came because you said we were going to play soccer.

13
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,225
Hey, say something, Conan.

14
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:19,425
I kind of feel like reading too.

15
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:22,825
What? You're the one who said you wanted to play soccer.

16
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,825
You traitor!

17
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,925
Really, talk about childish.

18
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,225
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

19
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,225
You're going, aren't you, detective?

20
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:11,925
"Deadly Venom Spider Trap"

21
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,225
Why don't you try calling the professor?

22
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:26,125
My hands are full right now.

23
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,125
Why don't you call?

24
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,725
I will then.

25
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:32,425
Oh, it's okay, I'll call.

26
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,725
It's the signal of lunch break for a nearby factory.

27
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,525
He's not answering.

28
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,325
Will you call him later?

29
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:48,725
Okay.

30
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,225
A red-back spider.

31
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:00,825
-What? -Look out!

32
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,525
Genta, don't push me.

33
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:03,725
We're not going to...

34
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:09,625
Just what are you doing?

35
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,525
It's because you guys left on your own.

36
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,125
It's no fair.

37
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,425
Ayumi too?

38
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,125
Hey! Just what are you guys doing?

39
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,225
What? Mitsuhiko?

40
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,325
What?

41
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:24,725
Do you know him?

42
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:30,325
Yes, he's Mr. Itogawa who lives next door to me.

43
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:32,225
"Tooru Itogawa (32)" -He's a professor who's researching spiders

44
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,925
at the university.

45
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:40,925
That's a red-back spider, isn't it?

46
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,925
"Yoshiki Urazaki (38)" -Yeah, that's right.

47
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,025
It's amazing that you know, kid.

48
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,825
Some years ago, it was discovered in Japan

49
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:50,525
and was big news.

50
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,225
You see how its back is red?

51
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,225
That's why it's called the "Seakagoke" spider.

52
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:59,625
It's also called the red-back spider.

53
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,925
It's a poisonous spider

54
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,925
that lives mainly in Australia and Central America.

55
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:06,525
You mean a venomous spider is in Beika-cho?

56
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:10,625
"Miwa Yasuda (28)" -No, we're borrowing this yard to take pictures.

57
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,725
I'm a reporter.

58
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,825
We're making this magazine.

59
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:18,025
We're doing a venomous spider special in our next week edition.

60
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,125
See.

61
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,525
Then, that spider is...

62
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,325
He's my pet.

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,225
Pet?

64
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:29,825
Although I may not look it,

65
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,425
I'm quite well-known as a "venomous spider freak".

66
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,925
I have a variety of venomous spider pets.

67
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,625
We're leaving to interview the professor,

68
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,125
so call him, will you?

69
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,325
Yes, ma'am...

70
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:52,325
Hello, Professor, this is Urazaki.

71
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,725
What's the matter, professor?

72
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:59,825
It bit me! The black widow spider bit me!

73
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,225
What?

74
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:04,325
Please inject yourself with the serum! Professor!

75
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:06,825
The serum...

76
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,225
"Beika Agriculture University West Entrance"

77
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:15,025
"Shinno Laboratory"

78
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,225
Darn it! It won't open!

79
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,625
Here's the spare key.

80
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:27,925
Professor!

81
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,325
All of you stay here.

82
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:32,725
Okay.

83
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,225
Oh, no. He's dead.

84
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:44,025
The professor passed away.

85
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:46,125
Why?

86
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,325
Look, there is no sign that he injected the serum.

87
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,925
No way.

88
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,525
Mr. Urazaki,

89
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,225
hurry call the police.

90
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,125
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing, Miwa?

91
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,825
Look!

92
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,625
It's a venomous spider, the one that bit the professor.

93
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,025
I'm telling you, stop it!

94
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,925
It's already dead.

95
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,025
That spider has nerve venom

96
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,325
that is several times stronger than that of the red-back spider.

97
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:30,425
But not strong enough for a human to die instantly.

98
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,425
Don't touch it!

99
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,525
We have to leave it that way until the police get here.

100
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,225
Hey.

101
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,625
Let me borrow it a while.

102
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,325
Hello, is this the police?

103
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,525
Yes...

104
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,525
Which means he was bitten here?

105
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,025
It's gone.

106
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,725
The serum for the Black Widow Spider is gone.

107
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,025
What?

108
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,725
It's always left over here and yet...

109
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,625
Hey, take a look.

110
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,825
It seems to have escaped from here.

111
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:22,925
He never ever forgot to close the lid before.

112
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:26,125
We're only human, so there are times we forget.

113
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,525
This is...

114
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:43,925
Understand? Don't come in during investigation.

115
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:45,825
What's with him?

116
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,625
We're witnesses to the case too.

117
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,125
If you chase us away, the case won't be solved.

118
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,625
The ones who have the key to this room are Professor Shinno

119
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,025
and Mr. Itogawa, his assistant?

120
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:01,725
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,825
Mr. Urazaki, you were acquainted with the professor.

122
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,625
Were the door and windows always locked?

123
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:13,225
Yes, sir. It's because a variety of venomous spiders are being bred.

124
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,125
To think that he forgot to

125
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,325
close the lid of the breeding box of venomous spiders...

126
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,625
Are you bothered?

127
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,425
Oh, then go ahead and think like that forever.

128
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,425
I saw something.

129
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,425
What did you see?

130
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:41,225
There's a scratch on the professor's ear

131
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,925
as if he brought the receiver to his ear without realizing that

132
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,525
the spider was there and was bitten.

133
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:49,325
But it seems to be rare that

134
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:53,025
someone who is bitten by this spider dies on the spot.

135
00:09:55,225 --> 00:10:00,625
Conan, I just told you not to come inside!

136
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,125
Oh, just for a while.

137
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,225
Isn't this medicine for the heart?

138
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:14,425
Did the professor have a heart problem?

139
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,425
Yes.

140
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:18,025
Really? I didn't know.

141
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:21,525
If so, it was an accident after all?

142
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:24,825
You're the one who called the professor, Mr. Urazaki?

143
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,825
Yeah, but Miwa called him before I did.

144
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,625
Nobody answered the phone at that time, right?

145
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,125
Right.

146
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:39,325
Conan! Be careful with that.

147
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,625
That's right, I have to call Pops.

148
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,225
"Urazaki Cell Phone" -Mr. Urazaki's call is here.

149
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,025
If you need to make a call, I'll lend you my cell phone.

150
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,225
It's okay. I already got through.

151
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:03,125
Hello, Pops?

152
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:11,125
It's the same model as the one back then.

153
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:17,725
So, I'm going to be a little late. Why?

154
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,725
This is not an accident!

155
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,347
What's the matter, Mr. Itogawa?

156
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:48,047
I have to attend a academic conference tomorrow.

157
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:51,947
I'm going to have to deliver the speech in place of the professor.

158
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:56,347
What? How can you talk about a conference at a time like this?

159
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,647
But, it's an important academic conference that was scheduled long before.

160
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:03,947
So if I have the documents, I can deliver the speech.

161
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:05,747
The truth is...

162
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,347
it's your research isn't it, Mr. Itogawa?

163
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:11,547
What? Is that true?

164
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,847
The professor was delivering speeches

165
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:17,947
on the results of Mr. Itogawa's research all this time

166
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:20,847
as if it were his own.

167
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:24,847
So he snatched away the works of his assistant.

168
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,847
It's the usual stuff that goes around.

169
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:31,847
Which means that you had a grudge against the professor, Mr. Itogawa!

170
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,447
Speak for yourself, Mr. Urazaki

171
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:34,847
What? Why you...

172
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:37,747
Come on, Mr. Urazaki.

173
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:41,647
So, do you have something against him too?

174
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:44,647
No, I don't.

175
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,047
If you've got something, will you show it to us?

176
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,447
No, it's nothing.

177
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:51,247
It's nothing, I tell you!

178
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,847
Then, please show it to us, Mr. Urazaki

179
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:54,947
Darn!

180
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:59,847
Those are all rare spiders

181
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,947
that aren't found in Japan.

182
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,547
Just what does this mean?

183
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,147
Mr. Urazaki was buying the spiders from the professor.

184
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,147
Spiders?

185
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:11,147
Yes.

186
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:14,747
Saying that it would be used for research,

187
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,047
the professor was able to get a hold of rare and valuable spiders

188
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,747
from all over the world.

189
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:20,947
And he's sly too.

190
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:24,947
He picks on our weaknesses and raises the price.

191
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,247
Moreover, you had a grudge against the professor.

192
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,747
Absurd, this is an accident.

193
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:36,747
He was punished for playing around with my passion for spiders.

194
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:40,347
Pops says he's figured out who the killer is!

195
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,047
Conan? You're still here!

196
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,147
He says that this is not an accident?

197
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:47,947
Right, he says that it's strange that

198
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,047
only the serum for the Black Widow Spider is missing.

199
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,847
It's true that everything fits in too well

200
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:55,047
if it isn't an accident.

201
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:59,447
Mr. Itogawa, you're the only one who has the spare key.

202
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,747
Yes.

203
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:03,447
But, Mr. Itogawa, as well as Conan and the others

204
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,547
heard the professor scream at the same time.

205
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:12,147
Pops says to check this telephone carefully.

206
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:14,547
-The telephone? -What?

207
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:16,747
There's something shiny over here.

208
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:17,847
What?

209
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,347
Something is definitely inside the hole

210
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:25,847
just where the ear is to be placed.

211
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,447
It's a needle.

212
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,947
So, this is what was inside!

213
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,147
The tip of the needle is broken off.

214
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,847
What's up, Conan?

215
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,647
The toilet!

216
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,547
The tip of the needle is broken off

217
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:58,647
so you can't tell from the exterior of the telephone.

218
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:03,047
Which means that the thing that poked the professor's ear is this needle.

219
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:07,247
Then, why did he shout, "I was bitten by a Black Widow Spider"?

220
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,047
Yes.

221
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,347
Mr. Mouri!

222
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,047
I've heard about the circumstances from Conan.

223
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:20,047
The killer poked a Black Widow Spider on to the needle point

224
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,947
of the thumbtack that was rigged inside.

225
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,847
Take a very close look using the magnifying glass

226
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,547
at that dead spider over there.

227
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,747
-Wait. -Hey, Takagi.

228
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:38,847
I see!

229
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:44,247
Takagi, hurry and explain it to us too.

230
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:47,447
Hey, Mouri! Just what are you trying to get to?

231
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,647
In other words, Inspector! This is how it is...

232
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:05,247
The killer who rigged the needle into the telephone

233
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:09,747
pokes a spider that is killed beforehand onto the tip of the needle,

234
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:12,647
to make the professor mistakenly think

235
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:15,147
that he is bitten by a Black Widow Spider.

236
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:17,047
Then for the serum.

237
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:19,847
The killer steals the serum for the Black Widow Spider.

238
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,847
After all is done, the killer replaces the phone

239
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,147
and just waits for the professor to pick up the phone.

240
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,247
So, that's the story.

241
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:32,247
Which means that the professor died because...

242
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:37,247
Hello, Professor Shinno, this is Urazaki.

243
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:43,147
It bit me! The black widow spider bit me!

244
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:48,047
Please inject yourself with the serum! Professor! The serum!

245
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:53,747
It's gone!

246
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,647
The serum is gone!

247
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:12,447
All right, Mr. Mouri, goodbye then.

248
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,847
Inspector, the professor did not die from the venom of the spider.

249
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:18,847
Which means?

250
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,947
Since he's a venomous spider researcher,

251
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:24,647
he is well aware of the danger of spider venom.

252
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,047
He had to inject himself immediately with the serum,

253
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,647
but he couldn't find it.

254
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,247
Since the professor had a weak heart,

255
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:33,847
if cornered into such a situation.

256
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,547
I see, if the person has a weak heart,

257
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:39,147
the sudden stress make induce an attack.

258
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:40,847
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:42,347
Which means that the killer is someone

260
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:44,647
who can go in and out at will from the research lab,

261
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,147
as well as know about the professor's weak heart.

262
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:51,647
Just what proof do you have to say something like that?

263
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:55,547
Mr. Mouri said,

264
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:59,147
"look at the incoming calls record of the telephone".

265
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:02,347
"Urazaki Cell Phone" -12:50 pm, Urazaki cell phone.

266
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,347
I made the call and the professor answered.

267
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:10,547
"University Clerk Office" -5:30 pm, university clerk office.

268
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,247
This is yesterday's record,

269
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:14,047
it has nothing to do with today.

270
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:15,347
Strange,

271
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:19,347
Yasuda should've called the professor once before I gave him a call.

272
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,847
The time was 12:00 pm

273
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:24,347
because the lunch break time tone of the factory.

274
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:28,647
Oh, I seemed to have called the wrong number back then.

275
00:18:29,747 --> 00:18:32,347
Will you please show me your cell phone?

276
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:40,247
She's definitely called a different number.

277
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:44,447
Huh? That cell phone's the same as Mr. Itokawa's.

278
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:47,747
What? Oh, it's just a coincidence.

279
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:52,547
Pops said that Mr. Itokawa is protecting you.

280
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,447
He said that you're going out with each other.

281
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:55,447
What?

282
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,147
Although it's already an old model,

283
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:59,747
it's unusual that you both still use the same type

284
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,947
but of a different color.

285
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,847
I see.

286
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,847
If you two are going with each other,

287
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:07,947
Ms. Yasuda would have the opportunity

288
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,247
to make a spare key from the key that Mr. Itokawa has.

289
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:13,147
Besides that, she's knowledgeable about spiders

290
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:15,147
thanks to Mr. Itogawa telling her about them.

291
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,947
It's not all that strange that she could've known

292
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,047
that the professor had a weak heart.

293
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:24,347
Wait, it's true that we're going with each other.

294
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,547
But, that isn't reason enough to be suspicious of her.

295
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:29,747
We've got proof.

296
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:33,947
The seal with the blue flower on it, that's in your pocket.

297
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:39,447
We saw you secretly pick it up from the floor, Mr. Itogawa.

298
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,447
Will you please give it to me?

299
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:51,847
That's the nail art seal that you're using, isn't it?

300
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,947
No, it's not.

301
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,147
See?

302
00:19:56,147 --> 00:20:00,447
Can you show me the magazine you showed me a while ago?

303
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:02,947
Yes.

304
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,347
It's here.

305
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:11,347
See.

306
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,447
It's real!

307
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,047
Didn't you drop it today in this room?

308
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:24,847
If so, why did Mr. Itogawa try to hide the evidence?

309
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:31,647
You came here today before the professor came, didn't you?

310
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:36,047
Mr. Itogawa realized what you did and tried to hide the evidence.

311
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,347
Look at the antenna of that cell phone!

312
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:41,547
Isn't it full of scratches?

313
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,847
Yeah, now that you mentioned it.

314
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:47,147
There were scratches on the telephone over there too, weren't there?

315
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,247
I see.

316
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,447
She used the antenna of the cell phone

317
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:55,047
and stuck the needle into the receiver.

318
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,547
That's when the scratches were made.

319
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:00,447
I'm telling you, stop it!

320
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,547
You killed the professor

321
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,947
and tried to make it look as if he died accidentally.

322
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,347
You made Mr. Urazaki call

323
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:26,547
because you didn't want suspicion to fall upon Mr. Itogawa or yourself.

324
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:28,447
Why did you do something like this?

325
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,147
Whenever the professor delivers a speech at the academic conference,

326
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:35,247
it is Mr. Itogawa's research results.

327
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,547
I just couldn't take it anymore.

328
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,947
I was just hoping that the professor would be hospitalized

329
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:42,947
with a heart attack or something.

330
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:46,447
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

331
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:47,547
Miwa.

332
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:54,747
This is a crime that cannot be forgiven.

333
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,847
After all, you did take someone's life.

334
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:30,047
So, the spider was innocent after all.

335
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:33,547
Because if you take a good look at it, it's small and cute.

336
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:34,947
I guess you're right.

337
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,747
Conan, there's a spider on your shoulder!

338
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:40,847
Don't worry, it's not a venomous spider.

339
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:44,647
That spider's the one that was in the professor's breeding box!

340
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:48,747
What? Do something, please. Haibara!

341
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:49,947
I'm just joking!

342
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:57,347
You guys! Just keep laughing.

Isn't that the hill?

345
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,247
What?

346
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:08,947
It's most likely that Mr. Kono left these here,

347
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,547
before the killer came back down here, after pushing him off the cliff.

348
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:14,647
Oh, no! I lost sight of him!

349
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:17,947
What is it that's bothering you?

350
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:19,347
What was that sound?

351
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:23,447
Kudo, don't tell me you...
