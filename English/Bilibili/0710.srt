1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:03,024
We've got a case! Kudo!

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:05,524
Huh?

3
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:10,324
Hattori and Kazuha.

4
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:12,424
What do you mean by Kudo?

5
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:13,424
Huh?

6
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:15,924
You said that name just now, didn't you?

7
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:17,624
"We've got a case, Kudo!"

8
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,824
I meant, "You all got a case to go to."

9
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:24,224
Things will end up becoming lively.

10
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,524
It's a homicide,

11
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
and yet what an inappropriate thing to say.

12
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
A homicide?

13
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,624
Don't tell me you came all the way from Osaka

14
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,724
to discuss a case that happened there?

15
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,124
No, no!

16
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:36,024
It happened here in Tokyo,

17
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:39,524
and the witness is Mr. Otaki, here.

18
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:42,024
Inspector Otaki from the Osaka City Police Department.

19
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:44,524
Hi there, long time no see!

20
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,124
The case titled "Locked Room Murder

21
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:49,224
Where the Feet and Help were Not in Reach."

22
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:50,424
Right?

23
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,324
Yeah, I suppose.

24
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:56,924
What's that supposed to be?

25
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,024
Aim for a 100% solution.

26
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,624
Clear all mysteries and codes.

27
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,624
The mysterious murder that occurred in the elevator.

28
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:06,824
It's a deduction battle between Hattori and me.

29
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:08,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:13,224
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:02:56,604 --> 00:03:02,504
"Everyone Was Watching (Part 1)"

33
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:04,004
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -What?

34
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,104
The man who was under police surveillance

35
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,104
was killed without anyone noticing?

36
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,404
Yes. Last month a man in his 70's

37
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:15,104
died in his condo in Haido-cho.

38
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:18,804
The man who died called Hidemichi Mizuki,

39
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:22,004
used to be a high school teacher until a few years ago.

40
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,904
He taught a student

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,304
by the name of Kiriya Hido back then.

42
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,404
Kiriya Hido.

43
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:30,304
That name sounds familiar.

44
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,004
He's a serial killer who killed two people in Osaka

45
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,604
and one person in Kobe,

46
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:38,204
and was on the run.

47
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:40,804
We received intel that he was seen in Tokyo,

48
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,304
so we were working together with the MPD

49
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:45,304
and staking out Mr. Mizuki's condo.

50
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:47,704
If there was anywhere that Hido,

51
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:49,504
who has no family around would rely on,

52
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,204
we thought that he would go to Mr. Mizuki's place

53
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,104
because he helped Hido look for a job and etc.

54
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:54,904
And on the third day in the morning

55
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,604
after staking out,

56
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,704
although it was time for him to come out

57
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,704
to go on his usual walk, he didn't so.

58
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:01,904
I thought something was wrong

59
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:04,204
and went to check out his room.

60
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,504
I found Mr. Mizuki dead after hanging himself

61
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,104
from a rope passed through

62
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:12,004
the ventilation hole of the air conditioner.

63
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:16,204
Then, didn't he commit suicide?

64
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:18,404
Of course you were keeping an eye on the window

65
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,904
and entrance of his room too. Weren't you?

66
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,504
Yes. That's why the case

67
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:24,804
was closed once as a suicide case

68
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,904
but the position of the toes of the suicide victim

69
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,904
was strangely very high.

70
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,504
That is, it was slightly under my crotch.

71
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:33,504
And surprisingly,

72
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,104
the chair that was knocked over

73
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:36,804
by the feet of the victim...

74
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:40,604
Was the same as the one in my kitchen!

75
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,504
That chair was a vintage produced in limited number

76
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,804
and they were all of the same size.

77
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:49,404
I measured it together with Mr. Otaki

78
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:50,704
and found that from the toes of the dead body

79
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,204
to the seat of the chair

80
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,504
there was a space of more than 10cm!

81
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,504
Hey, hey,

82
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,304
if there was a space of more than 10cm,

83
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,704
then he wouldn't reach it even if he stood on his tiptoes!

84
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:01,904
Yeah.

85
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,504
In other words...

86
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,904
That chair was a prop

87
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,904
that the culprit deliberately put there

88
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:11,804
to make it look as if Mr. Mizuki had committed suicide!

89
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,604
I see. That's why,

90
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,804
"The Feet and Help were Not in Reach."

91
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:20,304
It seems that the room was not locked,

92
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:22,504
so it was most likely homicide.

93
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:26,804
It can't be that the killer called Kiriya Hido.

94
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,604
Wrong.

95
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:32,604
Kiriya Hido was arrested in Hiroshima

96
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:34,904
but, it seems he was spending the nights all this month

97
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,604
at an Internet Cafe.

98
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:40,004
But, the police had their eyes on him, didn't they?

99
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:44,304
How did he go in and out?

100
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:45,304
Right.

101
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,804
This is a case of circumstantial locked room murder.

102
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:50,804
We got permission from the bereaved family of the victim,

103
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,804
and are headed towards his condo from now.

104
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,404
And, you folks want to come along too, don't you?

105
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,904
And, is it true that

106
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,704
the crime scene is still left as is?

107
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:05,804
Yes.

108
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:08,304
The daughter of the victim said that she'd be coming

109
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:10,604
to get his belongings tomorrow, though.

110
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,904
Well, I guess there'd be no problem if we solved

111
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,204
the locked room murder case by today, right?

112
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,704
Look, look, Ran!

113
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,704
This elevator has a window!

114
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:22,004
There're quite a lot of them around! Those with windows on them.

115
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,904
Keep the noise down!

116
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,004
We aren't going on a play trip, you know!

117
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,704
I know!

118
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,704
I've got an important mission

119
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:33,004
that only I can carry out, you know!

120
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,304
An important mission?

121
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:40,204
No doubt about it!

122
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,504
This chair is the same as the one in my house!

123
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,604
Even the wood and the color are exactly the same!

124
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:46,904
Don't you think there's something strange

125
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,204
about this case after all, Heiji?

126
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:51,604
I've been telling you that to begin with.

127
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:54,004
Mission completed!

128
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:57,904
I mean she didn't have to come all this way.

129
00:06:57,904 --> 00:07:01,104
All she had to do was measure the height of the chair.

130
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,304
So, now, the question is,

131
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:05,104
how did the culprit go in and out of this room

132
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,004
under strict police surveillance?

133
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:10,904
Maybe there's a secret path somewhere?

134
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,104
Just as Inspector Otaki said,

135
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:15,004
the rope was passed through the ventilation hole

136
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,604
of the air conditioner.

137
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,904
Huh? There's something on the ground right below the rope.

138
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:23,104
Shaved pencil debris?

139
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:26,204
It seems that the inhabitant of this room

140
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:29,404
favored using pencils.

141
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,204
But, why would something like that be clumped up

142
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:34,404
and left on the floor like this?

143
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,504
From the looks of this room,

144
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,504
it seems that the inhabitant was pretty tidy

145
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:41,504
to the point of having a cleaning robot, and yet...

146
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,704
And the cylinder type trash can that

147
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:46,404
is knocked over in the corner of the room.

148
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:49,604
A tidy inhabitant would never leave something like that as is.

149
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,204
Hey, Hattori, don't tell me that this is...

150
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:58,404
Yeah. I guess the answer is this.

151
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:01,204
Hey, Heiji?

152
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:04,104
Just what're you doing? Moving something like that around.

153
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:06,204
Solving a mystery.

154
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,204
Huh?

155
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,604
When Mr. Mizuki hung himself,

156
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:13,104
he didn't use that chair as a foot stool.

157
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:15,304
He used this elongated trash box.

158
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:17,104
What?

159
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:20,204
He probably had this right under the rope.

160
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:21,504
He stood it upside down

161
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,804
so that he could easily climb on it.

162
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,204
As proof of it, pencil shavings

163
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:29,004
were found clumped up around here.

164
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,904
When he turned the trash box upside down, the shavings

165
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:34,904
that were stuck at the bottom of the trash box fell out.

166
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,004
See?

167
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:37,804
This is higher than the chair

168
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:39,404
and his feet would reach too, right?

169
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:41,204
But, Heiji.

170
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:44,704
When we came in, there was no such thing.

171
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:47,904
No problem.

172
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:51,304
When he hung himself, if he kicks the trash box over

173
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:54,704
so that it is caught between the legs of the chair.

174
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,204
All that needed to be done, was for the cleaning robot

175
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:02,404
to push the trash can over to the corner of the room.

176
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:05,104
Then, return to its original battery charging base.

177
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,704
This way, this strange situation

178
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:09,304
of the man being hung is completed!

179
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:11,004
The evidence is that

180
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:13,904
the robot only cleans this route.

181
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:16,304
I'm sure that the robot was probably made to

182
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,704
memorize this route

183
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,904
by putting obstacles in place as needed.

184
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,704
Hey, hold it.

185
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:24,304
Then, this case...

186
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:27,104
Yeah. No matter how you look at it...

187
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:29,204
It's a suicide.

188
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,704
Heiji.

189
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:35,204
Are you okay?

190
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:38,904
Too bad there was no chance to pitch in.

191
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:42,204
But, why did Mr. Mizuki decide to die like that?

192
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:44,304
Mr. Mizuki goofed at stocks

193
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:46,804
and seems to have been in great debt.

194
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:49,204
And, it seemed he really hated that stock broker

195
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:51,804
who caused him to end up that way.

196
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,504
He seems to have said when he was drunk

197
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:57,804
that he would go to hell together with that guy.

198
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,904
That's why he wanted to make it look

199
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,904
as if that broker killed him, maybe.

200
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,004
But, unfortunately,

201
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,804
because he was under police surveillance,

202
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,904
it was concluded without a doubt

203
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:12,104
that he committed suicide.

204
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:13,704
By the way, does that broker

205
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,904
live in this neighborhood?

206
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:17,204
Neighborhood's not the word.

207
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:20,104
It seems that he moved over there last year.

208
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,704
If I remember correctly, his name is...

209
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,304
Mr. Fuura who lives on the 2nd floor, right?

210
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:28,104
Everybody in this condo finds him to be a nuisance!

211
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:31,104
-Huh? -He talks about stocks with people

212
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,604
who are waiting for the elevator.

213
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:36,104
At first you make a little profit but,

214
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:37,804
the minute you let him take care of a large sum,

215
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,704
you lose a large amount.

216
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:42,004
Even my husband almost fell for it,

217
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:44,404
and it was tough trying to stop him from doing so.

218
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:47,104
Oh, is that so?

219
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,404
He was really like Death

220
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:51,004
and his face looked just like Death too!

221
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,904
His had hollow eyes and cheeks.

222
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,904
His complexion was pale.

223
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,404
Oh. Talk of the devil.

224
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:02,704
-Wh... -What?

225
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,196
Darn! It went up!

226
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,196
Mr. Otaki, where's the stairs?

227
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:19,196
I think it was...

228
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:21,796
You should know since you live here, don't you?

229
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,096
Never mind! I'll look for it myself!

230
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,396
Hold it!

231
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,596
It's come down.

232
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:28,596
What?

233
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:51,396
What? You were investigating a case

234
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,796
that was closed as a suicide case?

235
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,896
Yes. There was something that bothered me a bit, you see.

236
00:11:56,896 --> 00:12:00,096
I took a break and came over from Osaka.

237
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,096
After investigating,

238
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,196
it was concluded to be a suicide case after all.

239
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,796
Just as I was about to leave

240
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:07,696
on the elevator along with Mr. Mouri and the others

241
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:10,296
who came along with me to help me.

242
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,396
I ran into this site.

243
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:15,796
I see.

244
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,696
The deceased is Mr. Kaizo Fuura

245
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:21,296
who lives on the 2nd floor of this condo.

246
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:24,396
He seems to have been a stock broker.

247
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:26,296
Correct, isn't it?

248
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,896
Yes, sir.

249
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:30,096
Who is she?

250
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,596
She was trying to go downstairs

251
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,296
and rode the elevator with us.

252
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,296
Her name is Nanami and she lives on the 3rd floor.

253
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:41,296
It seems she goes to an esthetic salon every week at this time.

254
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:43,796
In other words, when the door of the elevator opened,

255
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,196
this is what you saw.

256
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:47,496
Wrong, Mr. Takagi.

257
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,696
From the window of the elevator that came from below,

258
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:52,996
we saw Mr. Fuura riding the elevator.

259
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:55,896
He shot himself in the temple with a gun.

260
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:02,096
It was just as if he wanted to show us what he was doing.

261
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:05,496
Which means that the elevator went up as is?

262
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,096
Yeah. I was going to confirm

263
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:10,196
where he was getting off so I went up the stairs but...

264
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,496
this elevator came down right away

265
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,596
and when the door opened...

266
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:17,796
This is what we saw.

267
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,196
Then, this is undoubtedly a suicide, no?

268
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:24,096
Yes. There's this message here too, you see.

269
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,096
Good...

270
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,696
Goodbye?

271
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:33,896
There's a spray can by the feet of the corpse,

272
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,996
rolling on the floor, see?

273
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,596
I think he used it to write what he did

274
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:39,496
just before he died.

275
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,896
A will, I guess.

276
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:44,196
That's why, no matter how you try looking at this,

277
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,196
it's definitely...

278
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,596
A murder.

279
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:48,596
Huh?

280
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,296
I'm telling you that no matter

281
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,196
how you look at it, this is murder!

282
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:55,396
You mean this is a murder case?

283
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:56,396
Yeah.

284
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:58,696
Don't say something so irresponsible!

285
00:13:58,696 --> 00:13:59,996
The case that you claimed to be a homicide

286
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:02,496
turned out to be a suicide case after all too, you know!

287
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:05,096
Take a good look at the surveillance camera

288
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:08,396
set up above the floor indicator of the elevator then.

289
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,996
It's covered with spray paint, isn't it?

290
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:13,996
True.

291
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:16,696
That's why I called the manager of this condo

292
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,396
and confirmed.

293
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:21,396
Then, I was told that a hand holding the spray can

294
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,996
suddenly appeared on the monitor and sprayed the camera.

295
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,696
Since the culprit

296
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,296
didn't want to be in view of the camera,

297
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:31,996
he stretched over his hand to cover it with spray.

298
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,996
But, maybe he just didn't want the camera

299
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:37,996
recording the suicide.

300
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:41,096
It was clearly on the recorded image.

301
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,496
The right hand of someone holding the spray can!

302
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:47,596
I'm sure it was the right hand.

303
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,596
Most Japanese people are right handed after all, you see.

304
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,796
Hold it there!

305
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:55,696
This man is holding the gun in his left hand.

306
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,796
Maybe he's left handed?

307
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:01,196
Everybody knows that Mr. Fuura is left handed.

308
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,996
I see! His left hand was holding the gun so...

309
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,096
Then, do you mean that he went out of his way

310
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,796
to hold the can in his right hand to write the word?

311
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:13,396
Besides, the wristwatch that he's wearing.

312
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,596
It's not unusual for a left-handed person

313
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:18,996
to be wearing his wristwatch on his left wrist.

314
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:21,396
No. It's stopped.

315
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:24,396
At the time when we found the corpse.

316
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:25,996
Then, maybe it ran out of battery

317
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:28,396
or broke when he fell.

318
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:31,996
But this wristwatch...

319
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,596
winds automatically!

320
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:35,296
It winds itself automatically

321
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,896
when the person wearing it moves, right?

322
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,496
See! It moves when it's shaken.

323
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:42,296
Isn't it strange?

324
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,796
True.

325
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:45,296
That's probably because...

326
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,796
The one who wanted to kill Mr. Fuura

327
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:49,996
deliberately made him wear the wristwatch

328
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:53,796
right after committing the crime.

329
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:55,796
I don't know why yet, though.

330
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,496
But the fact that, that someone

331
00:15:57,496 --> 00:16:01,796
is still somewhere here above the 3rd floor is what I do know.

332
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,596
After finding the corpse, I called

333
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,296
the manager's room on the 1st floor right away

334
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,596
and had them guard the stairs, you see.

335
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:09,296
Until you people from the police came,

336
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:12,896
there's no one who used the stairs to come down, you see!

337
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:16,096
Would you like me to go check each and every room?

338
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:17,696
Yes.

339
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:20,496
Then, let 's start from the 4th floor right above.

340
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,096
Three rooms?

341
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:26,196
There were only three suspicious rooms?

342
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:27,596
This building is a seven story building

343
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:30,796
and there are many rooms above the 3rd floor and yet...

344
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,896
Yes. Because of the suicide last month,

345
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:36,496
there seems to have been many people who moved out.

346
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,196
At any rate, the only ones who live alone

347
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:42,896
and had no alibi were the inhabitants of these three rooms.

348
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:48,596
If so, let's go hear the story of those three people once again.

349
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,796
I don't think that the person would think

350
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,496
it possible that he would be suspected so soon too.

351
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:56,996
No good. Heiji's switch is turned on.

352
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:58,896
What shall I do, when it's almost time for the bullet train

353
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,396
we're taking back home is going to depart.

354
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:03,596
I guess you'll just have to sleep over at our place.

355
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,596
Murder?

356
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,696
Didn't Mr. Fuura commit suicide?

357
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:15,496
No. The fact that he may have been murdered also emerged.

358
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:18,996
But, why do you know about this?

359
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:23,396
Because Nanami twitted on the internet that.

360
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:27,896
"'Death' committed suicide in the elevator of our condo."

361
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,496
"Death" refers to Mr. Fuura, the nickname

362
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,696
that Nanami gave him.

363
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:36,896
That lady was twittering when she was working her cell phone

364
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,996
without saying a word.

365
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:43,196
I hope you don't mind me stepping in a bit.

366
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,696
No.

367
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,596
I don't mind.

368
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:51,596
By the way, what do you do for a living?

369
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:54,596
I'm employed at a building maintenance company.

370
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:56,896
I handle intercoms and locker deliveries.

371
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:58,496
I also handle air conditioners.

372
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,796
Which means you also handle

373
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:03,096
elevator and security maintenance?

374
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,096
Yes. Sort of.

375
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:08,196
By the way, who are those young men?

376
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:11,296
Please don't let them bother you.

377
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,596
By the way, you.

378
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:15,896
What's your relationship with Mr. Fuura, the deceased?

379
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:19,796
Your name was in Mr. Fuura's cell phone, you see.

380
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:22,496
Oh, well, I talked to him a bit about stocks.

381
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:25,896
Which means that you lost out on stocks

382
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,096
because of Mr. Fuura, and hated him too?

383
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,696
It's true that I had a grudge against him,

384
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,596
but I wouldn't kill him because of it.

385
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,996
Please stick your hands forward, then.

386
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:36,396
Hands?

387
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,996
Don't tell me that you're arresting me just like that?

388
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,796
No.

389
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,296
We're just checking to see

390
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:47,496
if there are any discharge residue

391
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:49,896
on your hands and sleeves after a gun is fired.

392
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,896
Since the forensic officers are here too.

393
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:56,996
It's true that I lost out too,

394
00:18:56,996 --> 00:19:00,196
because of the stocks Mr. Fuura recommended me to buy.

395
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:02,096
But, I don't have any grudge against him!

396
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,196
Because it's my fault too for not being able to read

397
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:07,496
the direction of where the stocks were headed for, you see.

398
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,096
This room smells of thinner.

399
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:13,796
That's because I was coloring

400
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:15,696
the freshly severed-like dolls' necks.

401
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,996
Freshly severed necks?

402
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:22,696
They're making a splatter movie at my university,

403
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,496
and that's what they're going to be used for!

404
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,496
It's really well made, though.

405
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:29,496
They look real.

406
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:32,396
I'm sure that Ran would faint if she saw them.

407
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:36,096
That one over there looks exactly like my Dad.

408
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:38,996
If so, I'm sure you can make it then, no?

409
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:40,196
A freshly made severed neck

410
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,596
that looks exactly like Mr. Fuura?

411
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:44,796
Then, do you also take scenes of people

412
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:46,796
are shot successively with guns?

413
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:48,896
Not much of that.

414
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,596
I usually take movies of people being stabbed,

415
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,296
slashed or chopped up.

416
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:55,296
Do you have it too?

417
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,496
The same wristwatch as Mr. Fuura?

418
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,396
Yeah. I got it as a gift from Mr. Fuura

419
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,796
when I made out on the first stocks I bought.

420
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,696
Mr. Mutsu that we talked to a while ago

421
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:06,896
was also wearing the same wristwatch.

422
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:10,296
Well, it seems that yours is moving like it should be, though.

423
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,596
I usually wear it, you see.

424
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,096
Although I'm not wearing it now

425
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,796
to keep from getting paint on it.

426
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,996
Then, please show me your hands

427
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:19,896
so I can check for discharge residue.

428
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:23,796
Okay, but I was painting, you know.

429
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:25,896
So, it's like this.

430
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:29,396
Yes. If it's that wristwatch,

431
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,196
I also got it from Mr. Fuura.

432
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:35,196
In celebration of profiting from stocks.

433
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,396
I just wore it once and put it in my drawer,

434
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:38,996
never to take it out again.

435
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:43,696
Ms. Izutsu, what do you do for a living?

436
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:46,896
Can't you tell by looking?

437
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:50,196
A tracing table, tone, cutter knife.

438
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:51,896
A G-pen, mapping pen, a brush,

439
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,996
calligraphy paint and ink.

440
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:55,496
I'm a cartoonist!

441
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:58,696
Haven't you ever heard of my pen name Kotori Misono?

442
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:01,996
You're the author of the beautiful detective girl cartoon

443
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,696
that Chiba is hooked on.

444
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:07,596
Which means it wouldn't be hard for you

445
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,196
to come up with a story to make it look

446
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,396
as if someone committed suicide in the elevator

447
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,496
by using a gun, and kill him.

448
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:17,196
If I came up with such an amusing story,

449
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,196
I would've drawn a comic about it already.

450
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:24,096
It's too wasteful to use such a story on a guy like him.

451
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,396
How come you have four tracing tables?

452
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:29,896
Three are for my assistants.

453
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,296
They left after finishing what they had to do

454
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:32,596
this morning, though.

455
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:34,896
I always thought that the room of a cartoonist

456
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,896
would be full of books,

457
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,896
but you don't have too many.

458
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:42,696
You can say that again. There are only a few comic books lined out.

459
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:45,996
Just what age are you talking about anyway?

460
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,496
Don't put me in the same categories as cartoonists

461
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,496
in the past, mind you?

462
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:55,096
I would like to check your hands for now.

463
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:58,596
I don't mind.

464
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,696
Too bad I disappointed you.

465
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:03,696
As you can see, I just finished taking a bath.

466
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:07,696
The discharge residue would've washed off already.

467
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,396
Mr. Mouri, did you come up with something?

468
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,396
No, not at all.

469
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:15,396
All three of them seem suspicious

470
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,296
and on the other hand, not.

471
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,696
No. The culprit is probably

472
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:22,696
that person who was hiding that thing.

473
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:25,296
The question is the trick.

474
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:30,696
How did the culprit kill Mr. Fuura?

475
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,896
Well, you two are full-fledged only

476
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:56,196
when you work together too, so...

477
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:57,396
Hold it right there!

478
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,396
Just what do you mean that we're full-fledged only

479
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,696
when we work together?

480
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:02,296
Wait a sec. If that is used...

481
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:05,296
Yeah, the word 'Goodbye'...

482
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:08,696
It's not a mere will made to look like a message.

483
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:10,696
Oh, it's Officer Takagi!

484
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,096
Bang!

485
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:22,096
Next Conan, "Everyone was Watching (Part 2)"

486
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,796
Next Conan's Hint:

487
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:42,196
"Word Written With Spray"

488
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,696
Kakudo, Kokudo and Sokudo.

489
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:45,096
-What is that? -They're words of excuses

490
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:47,196
that I can use the next time I mistakenly call you Kudo.
