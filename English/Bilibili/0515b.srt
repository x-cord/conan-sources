1
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:06,898
Did you see Thief Kid last night?

2
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:09,198
I saw him! I saw him! He was on TV!

3
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:12,798
Kid's teleportation was really awesome, wasn't it?

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,298
Yep! He's going to come and teleport again tonight, right?

5
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:19,598
I'm really excited already.

6
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:23,898
Right. He disappears from the middle of an intersection

7
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,998
and the next minute he appears

8
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:27,598
like a bolt out of the blue on the roof of a building.

9
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:38,798
Maybe Thief Kid has psychic powers?

10
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:41,698
He doesn't have ESP.

11
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:45,598
He's just a thief that uses a bit of magic.

12
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:50,398
Oh, then have you figured out how he does his magic?

13
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,298
You were there at the intersection

14
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:54,598
where Thief Kid was too, weren't you, Conan?

15
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:56,698
Yeah. Well, I guess I was,

16
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,598
but I haven't figured out how he did it yet.

17
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:02,398
Could it be that there were two Thief Kids?

18
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:03,698
One of them was on the ground,

19
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,198
stole the treasured mule and vanished,

20
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:09,398
then the other one who was hiding on the roof appears later.

21
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:11,698
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

22
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:13,398
Not possible.

23
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:17,298
The guard who was protecting the exhibition stand

24
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:20,298
happened to put his handprint on Kid's cape just before he disappeared

25
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:23,298
and that handprint was found on the cape of Kid who appeared on the roof.

26
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,498
The mule that he gave the TV reporter was unmistakably

27
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:31,198
the replica that Jirokichi Suzuki had made.

28
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:34,298
It could be that Kid has a twin brother.

29
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:35,398
That's possible.

30
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:37,698
If so, that's really something.

31
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,998
They're not listening to me.

32
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:43,698
Well, but it's for sure that he displayed a miracle.

33
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:46,398
He vanished in the middle of an intersection surrounded by a net

34
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,498
in front of a large crowd of people.

35
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:50,798
And in a matter of only 20 seconds

36
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:54,198
he moved to the roof of a nearby building.

37
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,098
Yeah. It's true that it seems humanly impossible.

38
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,798
But if look at it from a different view,

39
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,798
he needed almost 20 seconds to make his move.

40
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:08,298
I'll figure out the mystery of the 20 seconds no matter what,

41
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:12,198
and reveal how he carried out his teleportation trick.

42
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:17,098
You look to be enjoying yourself.

43
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,898
You look just like a child ready to open a gift box

44
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,398
that was given to him.

45
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:25,198
But, be careful.

46
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:28,898
After all, he's the Moonlight Magician, Thief Kid.

47
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,898
He's already displaying that

48
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:33,798
he's not fretting by appearing at night

49
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:36,798
wearing a conspicuous white outfit.

50
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:40,198
Yeah. I know.

51
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:56,698
Hey, I mean they're already blocking the place off

52
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,098
even before Thief Kid's appearance.

53
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:00,998
They're not letting the general public inside either.

54
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:01,998
Now that you mentioned it,

55
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,998
Uncle Jirokichi seems to have shut out the TV staff

56
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,998
who were doing a live broadcast too.

57
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:11,698
That only man really goes all out.

58
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:15,498
Well, Inspector Nakamori, I really appreciate your cooperation.

59
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:16,798
No problem at all.

60
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:19,198
With my staff and the police department teaming up,

61
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,198
it'll be a cinch.

62
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:25,298
You should've done this to begin with.

63
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:30,098
Come on, Thief Kid! Let me see you teleport yourself.

64
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,998
I shall surely tonight,

65
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:34,598
in clear view of everything and everyone capture you

66
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,498
and insert this glorious even into the last chapter of my autobiography.

67
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,598
I will cover the front pages of the papers

68
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,398
with articles of my brave and glorious deed.

69
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,598
That old man's still hung up on something like that.

70
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,998
I will return this to you,

71
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,598
so if possible I will come back here tomorrow night.

72
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:58,398
Darling Thief Kid.

73
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:01,098
Oh, is this yesterday's live broadcast?

74
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,198
Yes, I'm watching the video

75
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,198
of darling Thief Kid's white outfit

76
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,698
while waiting because I have nothing better to do.

77
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:10,998
I've been wondering from some time ago,

78
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,398
but I wonder why Thief Kid always dresses in white?

79
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:17,198
I mean, he always appears at night so I would think that black

80
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:20,298
would be way more inconspicuous and better for him.

81
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,998
Why else? It's because darling Thief Kid

82
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:25,498
is daring and fearless as well as graceful!

83
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,298
Never mind that, but is that thief really going to show up?

84
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:30,498
What a stupid thing to say.

85
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:32,198
There was never a time before

86
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:35,398
that Thief Kid didn't show up after giving out a warning.

87
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:46,998
What's that?

88
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,498
A parachute?

89
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,698
Good evening everyone, this is Thief Kid!

90
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:55,998
I hate to say this when you've all gathered here like this,

91
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:59,398
but I'd like to cancel tonight's magic show.

92
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,298
What... what did he say?

93
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,998
I would like to perform my magic show for all of you,

94
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:10,698
however, there are no spectators or TV cameras

95
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,798
to watch me closely.

96
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:15,498
Under this bland circumstance, I can't seem to raise my adrenalin level.

97
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:18,098
Therefore, goodbye everyone.

98
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,898
No way. Kid isn't coming?

99
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:26,098
What the heck? I left my office early for this!

100
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:28,298
Let us into the net!

101
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,098
Yeah, let us in!

102
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:41,098
Let us in...

103
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:43,998
Inspector, there's a person who says

104
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:46,198
he saw someone fire a queer looking gun.

105
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,198
What?

106
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,698
You mean Thief Kid is somewhere among this crowd?

107
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:53,698
Find him! He still around here somewhere!

108
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:57,198
Right, he scattered cards out last night too,

109
00:05:57,198 --> 00:06:00,398
just before appearing on the roof.

110
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:03,498
They came falling 5 to 6 seconds before he appeared

111
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:05,898
so he should've fired a little before that.

112
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,398
Since no one saw him back then,

113
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:09,798
he would've had to leave the ground

114
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:13,398
approximately 10 seconds after vanishing.

115
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:17,398
But, 10 seconds is only just enough to weave through the crowd

116
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:20,998
and make it below the building he teleported himself to.

117
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:25,698
Moreover, he flew three cards in a row.

118
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,998
If he was inside a building or hiding,

119
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:30,398
he couldn't have done something like that.

120
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:33,498
Going to the roof without hiding

121
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:35,698
or being seen by anyone in a short amount of time.

122
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:37,698
Is it really possible?

123
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:44,298
Let us in...

124
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:48,198
Hey, Kid wants spectators to watch him!

125
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,498
Let's all break inside!

126
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:56,698
Hey, wait.

127
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:17,698
Inspector, are you okay?

128
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,098
For Christ's sake.

129
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:30,398
Kid...

130
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:32,798
Inspector, the TV crew

131
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:35,198
is firing at us like arrows demanding to be let it.

132
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:36,298
What?

133
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,498
Ignore them. Ignore them!

134
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:41,598
No, I think you've got no choice but to let them through.

135
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,498
Unless Kid comes, we can't even capture him, can we?

136
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:48,898
Viewers out there,

137
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:51,998
we just got the green light to resume our live broadcast!

138
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:55,298
We, the crew of Nichiuri TV

139
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:56,498
will like we did last night,

140
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:58,498
will go up to the roof where Thief Kid teleported to

141
00:07:58,498 --> 00:07:59,898
and bring to you live all that happens.

142
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:02,298
So, let's wait for Thief Kid to appear.

143
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:05,698
Wow, they're resuming live broadcast.

144
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,798
Where's Conan?

145
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,098
He deliberately gathered the crowd into the net

146
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,398
and made them resume the live TV broadcast.

147
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:18,498
Does this mean that

148
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,298
he cannot carry out his trick unless this situation is set up?

149
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:25,598
Don't move.

150
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:29,398
Don't move, or you're dead.

151
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,898
Thief Kid.

152
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,009
Don't move.

153
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,009
Don't move, or you're dead.

154
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,409
Thief Kid.

155
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,909
Idiot, you're not scaring me with a toy like that.

156
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,809
Oh, boy. You're a wet blanket kid as always.

157
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,409
None of your business.

158
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:19,209
Hey, famed detective, do you know

159
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,209
about the 3 principles of Thurston?

160
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,309
Yeah.

161
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,809
The famed magician at the beginning of the 20th Century,

162
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:27,709
Howard Thurston.

163
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,709
The 3 principles defined in honor of his name,

164
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,409
the three taboos that should never be done

165
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,909
when performing magic, right?

166
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,309
Exactly.

167
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:42,309
Number 1, a magician should never reveal the trick behind his magic.

168
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,109
This isn't even worth mentioning though.

169
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:48,109
Number 2 is never explain what will be happening

170
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:51,409
before you perform your magic.

171
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:52,709
Because it will decrease the mystery

172
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,709
and kill the suspense of the magic.

173
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,209
Well, number 3

174
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,909
is never repeat the same magic twice.

175
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,109
Performing the magic once

176
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,709
will leave a strong impression and beautify the magic

177
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,209
as the greatest magic on earth into the hearts of the viewers.

178
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,009
But, performing it again, will urge the viewers to seek

179
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:19,409
what the trick behind the magic is than to enjoy what is happening.

180
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:23,009
The possibility of the trick being figured out will also increase.

181
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,209
I see.

182
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,109
In other words,

183
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,609
if you go ahead with the taboo,

184
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,509
and people still can't figure out how you did it,

185
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,609
you'll be the world's greatest magician?

186
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,609
Exactly.

187
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,909
Oh, there you are, Conan!

188
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,509
You should stay close by.

189
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,209
He's mingled among the crowd.

190
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:55,509
Now that there seems to be a great gallery and excitement is rising,

191
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:58,909
I would like to begin my show soon.

192
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,209
Please enjoy to your heart's content.

193
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,409
All right!

194
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:05,809
Thief Kid's come!

195
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:11,809
Kid...

196
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,409
The excitement is so great

197
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:16,109
that it looks as if he's already got hold of his target.

198
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,509
Well, if I, the famed Kogoro Mouri were to directly take charge,

199
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,309
I could take care of that thief hands down.

200
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:27,609
You know what they call people like you? Big fish in a small pond!

201
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,909
Big fish in a small pond?

202
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,809
In a small pond...

203
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,109
While we wait for Thief Kid to make his appearance,

204
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:36,009
let's take a look at last night's video tape recording

205
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:38,809
and examine Thief Kid's teleportation.

206
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,309
Thief Kid who arrived over the skies of Ginza on his hang glider

207
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,309
-and the next instant, was standing... -How exciting!

208
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,309
-on the exhibition stand -Yes.

209
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,609
vanished along with the smoke.

210
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:51,509
And, Thief Kid gets a hold

211
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,709
of the legendary mules, "Purple Nail".

212
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,809
However, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki's strategy,

213
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,109
includes blocking off the four corners of the intersection with a net

214
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,409
and sealing the place off completely.

215
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,009
"Osaka" -Despite this impossible to escape situation,

216
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,909
Thief Kid had declared with composure

217
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,609
that he will escape with teleportation.

218
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,809
Yes, this is Hattori.

219
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,809
Oh, Mr. Otaki of the Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

220
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:17,909
What's up?

221
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:20,609
I'm watching TV and it's coming to the best part now.

222
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,309
There's a case you want me to handle?

223
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,209
Yeah.

224
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:30,009
Yeah.

225
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,409
Centipede?

226
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,409
Thief Kid, who vanished from the exhibit stand along with smoke

227
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,009
and only about 20 seconds later,

228
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,709
-appears on the roof... -Let me take a good look at it.

229
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,709
of a department store 30 meters from ground.

230
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,409
A miracle indeed!

231
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:46,909
This is...

232
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:51,409
"Looking for favorite women!"

233
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,909
I wonder where Kid's going to teleport to today?

234
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,009
Beats me. I'm sure he's going to avoid teleporting

235
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,209
to the same building as yesterday, though.

236
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,009
Maybe he'll teleport to that helicopter!

237
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,809
I doubt it!

238
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,509
Wanna go see?

239
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:06,509
-What? -What?

240
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,109
I know where Thief Kid's going to teleport tonight.

241
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,509
What? Are you serious?

242
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:15,109
Where will he go, Conan?

243
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:17,809
Like Sonoko just said,

244
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,209
to one of the helicopters flying up there.

245
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,709
-Not. -Remember the time

246
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:26,609
Kid walked in mid air?

247
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,009
At that time he was suspended from a helicopter

248
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,009
that one of his friend's who was flying, right?

249
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,909
So, when he moved from one place to the next last night,

250
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:38,009
his friend pulled him up from above

251
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,409
and then put him down on the roof of the department store.

252
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:44,409
That's why it looked just like he teleported.

253
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,109
Come off it, stupid! No way!

254
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,909
Because of what happened last time,

255
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:54,109
Uncle Jirokichi was checking

256
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,009
the pilots of the helicopters with the utmost care.

257
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,009
Besides, unlike yesterday, the helicopters flying today

258
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,609
are police choppers.

259
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:03,609
Kid's accomplice wouldn't be able to get in that easily.

260
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,609
Besides, take a good look

261
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:08,709
at the crowd of people around the mules.

262
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:10,609
There are more than 200 people in that intersection

263
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,509
that is blocked off with a net!

264
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:15,409
If Kid is lifted up into the air from there,

265
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,709
someone's bound to be watching!

266
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,709
Well, it's no more than the shallow cleverness of a child.

267
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,309
I hate to admit it, but I'm sure Sonoko's right.

268
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:29,809
I thought I hit upon quite a good idea and then.

269
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,609
I've got to think it over from scratch again I guess.

270
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:44,209
Kid...

271
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,309
-So, it's nightfall is approaching. -Kid...

272
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,209
Among the crowd who are calling out to Kid,

273
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,809
will Thief Kid, as he did last night

274
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,109
get hold of the legendary mule, Purple Nail

275
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,209
that is placed in the middle of the intersection

276
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,309
and show us as he did last night

277
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,609
that miraculous performance of teleportation?

278
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,309
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid has appeared!

279
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:20,309
He's come. Darling Thief Kid has come after all!

280
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,309
How dare you. Thief Kid, I'm nabbing you for sure tonight...

281
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,409
Hold it, Inspector Nakamori.

282
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:29,409
Take a good look at the propeller on the rear.

283
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,209
That's a dummy after all.

284
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,809
I'm sure that just like last night he's going to explode the dummy

285
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,409
and during that time is going to head for the exhibition stand.

286
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,109
So, he's among the crowd somewhere

287
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:44,409
waiting for the right time to do so.

288
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,709
-Thief Kid! -Thief Kid!

289
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,609
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

290
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,809
Now, just like last night,

291
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:09,009
please watch to your heart's content

292
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,709
as I teleport through time-space.

293
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,509
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

294
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,809
Hurry up and nab Kid!

295
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,609
If you want to nab me, suit yourself.

296
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:23,609
However, I warn you, don't ever let go.

297
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,009
Because if you're shaken off while teleporting,

298
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,709
you'll end up drifting through space-time.

299
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:41,209
Calm down! He's mingled among the crowd, that's all!

300
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,209
He's somewhere nearby, find him!

301
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,509
Hey, did Thief Kid teleport?

302
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,109
I can't see, we've got to go more in front.

303
00:16:57,109 --> 00:17:00,009
Okay on this side. Start.

304
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:03,209
I wonder if darling Thief Kid is going to teleport over here today?

305
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,309
I wonder where Conan went?

306
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,009
Okay, here goes the first shot.

307
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,009
-It's Kid's card. -Really?

308
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,709
"Three"?

309
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,509
"Two".

310
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,509
"One".

311
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,909
Zero.

312
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,309
Too bad, you're performing tonight's magic show for free.

313
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,609
You get no reward,

314
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:40,609
Mr. Moonlight Magician.

315
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:58,079
Too bad, you're performing tonight's magic show for free.

316
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,379
You get no reward,

317
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,379
Mr. Moonlight Magician.

318
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:06,079
Get rid of the weight! Hurry!

319
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,379
What's this?

320
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,979
It looks like a bag filled with sand.

321
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:19,179
Where did it come from?

322
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,379
The trick involving teleportation is extremely simple.

323
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:26,279
The principle of the pulley used in old wells was applied.

324
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,279
Your accomplices disguised among the TV crew

325
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,279
are installing two pulleys on the fence of the roof.

326
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,479
Then a wire with hooks on both ends

327
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,579
is pulled through the pulley.

328
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,779
One side is lowered below the building,

329
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,379
and the other end is hooked onto the body of your accomplice.

330
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,479
All that's left to do is vanish from the exhibition table,

331
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,979
weave through the crowd,

332
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,179
reach the bottom of the building

333
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,679
and attach the hook onto yourself,

334
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,779
which after your accomplice jumps off the building.

335
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:57,879
If a weight is used on the body of your accomplice

336
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:00,679
and he is made to be heavier than you,

337
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:01,679
by the principle of the pulley

338
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,279
your body will be lifted up to the roof in no time.

339
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,679
Therefore, it will look as if you teleported and appeared.

340
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,979
Since the TV crew are busy with the live broadcast

341
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,179
no one would notice even if one person were to leave

342
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,079
and go over the fence.

343
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:21,079
The sound of the pulley would be erased by the cheer of the crowd too.

344
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,479
The point is not to let the crowd below

345
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:27,379
notice the two-people going up and down.

346
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:31,279
Your accomplice can pass through the large banner over there

347
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,779
but you have to distract the eyes of the crowd from the building.

348
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,679
So, you had to scatter the cards.

349
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,579
Therefore, you could not hide yourself behind the banner.

350
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,979
So, you thought up this text news.

351
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:47,379
You deceived the eyes of the crowd by taking advantage

352
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,879
of the text moving from below upwards, while you ascended.

353
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,079
I see.

354
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,979
Your deduction that I heard over the wiretap a while ago

355
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,179
was a fake one to catch me off guard.

356
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:01,079
You already knew about the text news trick.

357
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,979
Yeah, thanks to the "contents" of last night's news.

358
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,079
The news that streamed

359
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,079
by just before you appeared on the roof of the building was

360
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,179
"Looking for favorite women!" (Written in Japanese characters.)

361
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,179
But, that phrase is quite ambiguous, isn't it?

362
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,179
That's when I saw through your trick.

363
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,979
The character that streamed by then was not "daisuki"(favorite)

364
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:22,479
but rather "inusuki" (dog loving).

365
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,479
That is, you were dressed in black and moved right along together

366
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:27,779
with the apostrophe of the character "inu" (dog).

367
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:31,779
Yes, a black outfit. I've finally figured it out.

368
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,879
The reason why you appear wearing an irrational white coloured outfit

369
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,679
that only makes you more conspicuous to people.

370
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,879
You're neither daring nor fearless.

371
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:43,079
It's because is easier to hide that way.

372
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,479
People have a tendency to unconsciously look for white things

373
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,279
if they suddenly vanish from before their eyes.

374
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,679
But, a quick change from white to black

375
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,379
will easily deceive the vision of others.

376
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,579
Yeah, and at the same time,

377
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:01,379
something white suddenly appearing from the dark...

378
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,779
is also mysterious, isn't it?

379
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
Hey, isn't that Thief Kid?

380
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,279
He's standing on the wall of a building!

381
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,179
The place Thief Kid teleported to tonight

382
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,679
is... What a surprise! On the digital bulletin board!

383
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,979
He's defying gravity and standing perpendicularly on the wall.

384
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,979
-No way. -No joke.

385
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,779
Darling Thief Kid, you're awesome.

386
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,179
Well, give yourself in.

387
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,179
If you go all the way up like this, you may be saved,

388
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,679
but your accomplice who is lowered to the ground

389
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,879
will be arrested by the police.

390
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:43,179
If the reverse happens, that's it for you.

391
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:44,579
Kid!

392
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,179
I'm not letting you get away!

393
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,079
I'll see you in the center then.

394
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,279
Center?

395
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,379
Give me your hand!

396
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,879
He made it through the net in the nick of time.

397
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,679
"Given that these aren't quite the jewels I was after,"

398
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,279
"I relinquish them to you. By Theif Kid"

399
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,279
That rat.

400
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,579
You really did a good job last night, Conan.

401
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,979
It's amazing how you got inside the building.

402
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:11,379
I'm a kid, so I get to skitter around here and there.

403
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:13,679
Well, I did put the security guard to sleep

404
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,779
with my tranquilizer gun, though.

405
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,779
It's in the morning papers.

406
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:22,379
"Great Victory for Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki!"

407
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,879
I'm sure that gramps can sleep well to his heart content from today.

408
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:30,179
Look at the big picture of his face too.

409
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,379
I wonder about that.

410
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,879
My face is on the side.

411
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,079
It's a centipede!

412
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:50,279
If that's true, this is a serial killing.

413
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,479
Moreover, there may be more victims.

414
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,479
This is...

415
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,179
Impossible crime.

416
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:08,979
Next Conan special,

417
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:12,479
"Fuurinkazan: Armored Warrior in a Labyrinth"

418
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,879
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,079
"Centipede"

420
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,579
I'm appearing in the next episode!

421
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,279
Heiji, me, too!

422
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,279
Oh, yeah.
