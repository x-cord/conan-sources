1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,340
Kogoro Mouri disappears.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,240
But the fact was that he was working undercover in cooperation

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,340
with Inspector Megure to approach a band of robbers.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,940
Mr. Head, the boss whose face is unknown,

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,240
sees through Kogoro's true identity

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,440
and requests him to do an unexpected investigation.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,340
She's a cute daughter, isn't she?

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,940
Ran!

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,140
Why you... What're you up to?

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,740
It's up to you.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,040
Darn it! What do you want?

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,840
Just as expected of a great detective,

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,640
getting right to the point.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,340
Hurry spit it out!

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,740
You deliberately disguised yourself

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,040
and almost succeeded your mission.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,440
So, just as scheduled,

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,240
work along with my men as a skilled safe breaker.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,540
What?

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,440
The fact is...

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,540
Among my men, there's the one who killed my son.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,140
I'd like you to determine who it is with your skills as a great detective

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,040
by dawn, of the day after tomorrow.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,440
What?

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,640
Dawn day after tomorrow is also the time,

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,740
when we carry out our plan this time and leave Japan behind us.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,140
That's why I need you to do so by then.

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,440
What, after specifying who it is?

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,640
Are you planning to avenge the death of your son?

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,040
That's none of your business.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,440
But, if you refuse my request,

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,240
you'll never see your daughter again.

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,340
If the killer isn't instructed to cancel before the time limited by me,

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,740
he will kill her.

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,640
Don't tell me you had this in mind to begin with.

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,940
Darn it!

37
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,440
But I believe in...

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,940
Kogoro Mouri, your skills as a great detective!

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,240
What?

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,240
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,940
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,640
Pops and I are in a Catch -22 situation.

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,740
The unexpected purpose of the band of robbers.

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,640
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:57,236
"The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 2)"

48
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:02,336
They haven't been found yet?

49
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:05,136
No, not yet! But time-wise,

50
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:08,536
it's hard to think that they got through the emergency alert.

51
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:11,536
They probably have a secret hide-out somewhere.

52
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,936
And are waiting for a chance to flee.

53
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,636
The problem is where.

54
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,836
Darn it! All we got are the wallets of the customers!

55
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:27,136
If we got the safe opened,

56
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:29,636
it wouldn't have been anything like this!

57
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:35,336
Gosh. Why are you in a place like this?

58
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,136
No, no, let me go!

59
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:41,236
Cut out the fuss! I'll crush you!

60
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:43,036
I'm scared!

61
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:45,036
Cut out the noise, you brat!

62
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,136
Stop it! He's just a kid.

63
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,136
You're way noisier than he is!

64
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,036
-What? -What?

65
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:53,136
Cut it out, both of you!

66
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,436
Never mind that.

67
00:04:55,436 --> 00:05:00,036
Mr. Head! I wanna ask you something!

68
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:04,136
Why's Kogoro Mouri here?

69
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,236
You brought him here!

70
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:09,636
You better give me an answer that'll convince me!

71
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,336
Are you listening, Head?

72
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,736
Do you remember?

73
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:26,636
This underground casino is the one that you guys attacked a year ago.

74
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:29,636
One of my comrades were killed there.

75
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,936
I want to know the truth of what happened a year ago.

76
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:37,836
In other words, I asked the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

77
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:42,036
to figure out who killed my son.

78
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:45,036
He was your son?

79
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,936
That good-for-nothing brat?

80
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:48,336
It's a first.

81
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:50,736
Oh, what a surprise.

82
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:55,136
It's best to leave things like these up to specialists, you see.

83
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,936
I'm counting on you, Great Detective.

84
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:01,436
Leave it to me. But, don't forget.

85
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,736
Good luck.

86
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,236
Pim...

87
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:13,036
Mr. Pimple was killed by the people at the underground casino.

88
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:16,436
You were convinced of that a year ago, too.

89
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,936
Why bring it up again like this?

90
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:19,336
Not worth it!

91
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,836
I can't be playing along with this!

92
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:25,036
What?

93
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,336
It won't open!

94
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,336
Just what are you up to?

95
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,336
When the time comes,

96
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,236
the lock of the door will open automatically.

97
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:36,136
If you try to flee before that...

98
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:40,636
There's no guarantee that you'll live.

99
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:43,836
Hey, hold it! I've got nothing to do with this.

100
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,936
I was just waiting in the car like usual, you know!

101
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:52,036
I heard that Pim was killed after everything happened, too!

102
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,636
Then, let's go over the details of the incident

103
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,536
that happened a year ago.

104
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:05,036
It may have been my mistake

105
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:08,436
to add Mr. Pimple to the job we did a year ago.

106
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:12,136
I'm sorry!

107
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,636
Come on. Be more careful, will you?

108
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:15,436
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:20,236
He stood out so much.

110
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:22,236
Talk about a good-for-nothing brat...

111
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:25,036
Making him go there beforehand was just a waste of time.

112
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,236
Wanna crush him once?

113
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:29,036
It's about time we go.

114
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,336
What?

115
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:37,136
Nobody move! Hands in the air!

116
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,936
Do as you're told!

117
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:40,536
If you resist, I'll crush you!

118
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,936
Put the wallets in there!

119
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,536
Hey! Hurry it up!

120
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:55,736
-What's going on? -What's up?

121
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,736
Help!

122
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,636
-What is it? Gunshots! -I'm scared!

123
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:01,936
-The lights are back on! -Is he dead?

124
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,136
What happened?

125
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,236
Fire!

126
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:12,536
-Run! -Hurry! I don't want to die!

127
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:13,836
Run for it!

128
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,036
So Mr. Pimple was found,

129
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:21,836
as a burnt unidentified body from the burnt remains.

130
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:28,136
But this is based only on what you guys reported to me.

131
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,036
Just what do you mean?

132
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,836
Look at this.

133
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,036
This is the image that was found on the security camera

134
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,536
that was set up in that underground casino.

135
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:38,836
Great Detective.

136
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,536
Does looking at this bring any questions to mind?

137
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,536
What? Yeah.

138
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:45,136
Well...

139
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:52,036
Back then, you were disguised as customers and snuck in, right?

140
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:55,136
Yeah. That's why we let Pim in first

141
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,836
and made him hide the guns and knives.

142
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:01,036
Mr. Pim was disguised as a waiter, right?

143
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:04,636
That's right, although it turned out that way.

144
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:07,336
He was crushed because he asked for it.

145
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:08,936
That's right.

146
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,636
And? Is there anything else?

147
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,736
The floor is spic-and-span.

148
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:19,136
It's called marble, right? That floor.

149
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:21,036
True.

150
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,336
So, what about it?

151
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:27,036
Darn it. Shape up, man.

152
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,336
Hey.

153
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:31,436
That wound on your finger, did somebody bite you?

154
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,936
What?

155
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:34,336
This is...

156
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:37,436
I was bitten by a dog, long time ago.

157
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,936
The knife, too?

158
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,336
Because there's a scratch

159
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:44,436
that looks like the handle of the knife's been bitten, too.

160
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:45,836
Yeah.

161
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,136
I jokingly scared it. It bit my hand and knife.

162
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:53,336
Strange. No dog was seen on the screen at the casino.

163
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,336
What?

164
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:58,036
But, in the image where Mr. Pin was lying on the floor a while ago...

165
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,036
Help!

166
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:03,636
-What is it? Gunshots! -I'm scared!

167
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,636
The lights are back on!

168
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:07,336
-Is he dead? -What happened?

169
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:11,436
Pim?

170
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:17,336
I see! The dog that you're referring to is Mr. Pim, right?

171
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,836
Look! There's blood on his mouth!

172
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:23,936
It's just a coincidence!

173
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:26,636
I was bitten by a dog in the neighborhood.

174
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,736
Then, show me your knife!

175
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:29,736
Just by looking at it,

176
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,936
we can tell if it's the teeth of a human's or a dog's!

177
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,044
Crap!

178
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:01,144
He was shot to death!

179
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,944
My knife had nothing to do with it!

180
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:05,044
Awesome!

181
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,644
This is called an automatic, right?

182
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:09,944
When you fire, the cartridges fall to the floor

183
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:12,644
and bounce making clanking sounds.

184
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,544
I see. The sound!

185
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,844
Let me see the place that Mr. Pim was shot one more time!

186
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,944
Right after the gunshot that was heard during the blackout,

187
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:27,744
I'm sure you didn't hear the cartridge bounce on the floor!

188
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,144
Help!

189
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:33,744
-What is it? A gunshot! -I'm scared!

190
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:34,844
The lights are back on!

191
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,744
Which means... it was a revolver?

192
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,444
Exactly!

193
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:44,344
Hey, hey. As you can see, this is an automatic.

194
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:48,344
Maybe another one was snuck in or something.

195
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:54,544
If so, it would be impossible to get through the metal detector.

196
00:11:55,844 --> 00:12:00,344
It's neither ceramic nor plastic...

197
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,544
If it's made of...

198
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:07,644
I see. Resin!

199
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,944
If the gun is made of resin,

200
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:11,244
the metal detector won't detect it!

201
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:14,744
Furthermore, if such a thing were to be prepared beforehand,

202
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:18,044
it was contemplated murder!

203
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:21,344
There's no way that it would be someone from the casino side.

204
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:24,544
Because they would've known nothing about the attack on the casino!

205
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:29,044
It's only an assumption but during the blackout,

206
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:31,844
first Mr. Mouth uses his knife to render Mr. Pimple motionless.

207
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:34,644
Then, Mr. Eyes fires the bullet.

208
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:37,544
And made it look as if

209
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:40,144
somebody from the underground casino did it.

210
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:43,944
Then, are you saying that Mr. Mouth and I are the ones who did it?

211
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,744
Right!

212
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:49,444
Why don't we try it out, then, Mr. Great Detective?

213
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,444
What?

214
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:51,944
Isn't that why you went all out

215
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:55,944
and made a grand set like this, right, Mr. Head?

216
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,244
What's the matter? Exhausted or what?

217
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,144
Or have you run out of battery?

218
00:13:02,144 --> 00:13:03,944
That's a good one.

219
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:07,744
Never mind.

220
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,144
A year ago...

221
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:13,644
If Pimple was standing there before the blackout,

222
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:17,444
I was standing around here.

223
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:20,344
It seems that the place I'm in is here.

224
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:22,844
I'm here.

225
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,244
The blackout was 10 seconds.

226
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:27,544
The gunshot was heard 5 seconds after the blackout.

227
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:30,744
That's about it, I think. Right, Mr. Great Detective?

228
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,744
Yeah.

229
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,144
Then, here goes.

230
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,744
Okay!

231
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:37,044
Start!

232
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:40,844
Help!

233
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:44,244
-What is it? A gunshot! -I'm scared!

234
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:45,644
It's dark!

235
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,644
The lights are back on!

236
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,044
Time out.

237
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,244
I guess it really wasn't like this.

238
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:56,844
We barely made it.

239
00:13:56,844 --> 00:14:00,144
In the dark of the blackout, it was panic.

240
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,744
No good.

241
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:10,844
So, it's almost dawn.

242
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,544
What now, Great Detective?

243
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,044
What a goofy detective.

244
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,444
He should be crushed after all.

245
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:22,444
Hey, why did everybody close their eyes before the blackout?

246
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:34,244
But only Mr. Pim like the other customers didn't close his eyes.

247
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,444
I got it!

248
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:38,944
You guys knew that the blackout would occur beforehand.

249
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,344
Then, you set a timer onto the supply transfer panel

250
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:43,344
ahead of time and rigged it

251
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:47,444
so that the blackout would occur at a set time.

252
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:49,944
Nobody move! Hands in the air!

253
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:51,544
Do as you're told!

254
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:53,444
If you resist, I'll crush you!

255
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:57,244
Put the wallets in there!

256
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:00,544
Hey! Hurry it up!

257
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,544
Don't move!

258
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:20,544
-What is it? Gunshot! -I'm scared!

259
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,844
The lights are back on!

260
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:25,044
-Is he dead? -What happened?

261
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:30,444
-Fire! -Help!

262
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,344
It's obvious that you guys are the ones who set this fire, too.

263
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:38,144
In order to escape and get rid of the evidence.

264
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,244
You idiot!

265
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,544
That's why I told you to throw that away immediately.

266
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:44,044
Shut up! This is my partner!

267
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,344
Shut up!

268
00:15:47,644 --> 00:15:50,544
I've done my job, Mr. Head!

269
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:53,444
Tell the killer to stop the killing right away!

270
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:57,344
Don't lay a finger on my daughter Ran!

271
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:58,744
I knew it.

272
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:09,644
What's the matter?

273
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:12,444
Nothing. It's nothing.

274
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:15,944
Rather, is the detective's deduction for real?

275
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:20,344
Yeah, you did splendid, Great Detective.

276
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:26,444
Out of all people, Pim found out about our plan to kill Mr. Head

277
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,644
and take the loot for ourselves.

278
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:33,944
Well, we had no other choice, you see.

279
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:36,144
The same this time, too!

280
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:46,444
We've finally met, Mr. Head!

281
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:47,844
What?

282
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:58,944
Conan?

283
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,744
Ran. If you're safe,

284
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:04,144
please contact Inspector Megure right away.

285
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,644
Pops and I are fine.

286
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,144
We're with the band of robbers.

287
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,844
The place is at the warehouse district by the harbor.

288
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,844
For details, check the GPS.

289
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:15,244
What? What does he mean by if I'm safe?

290
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,244
But at any rate, I'd better call Inspector Megure!

291
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,944
The detection system of the auto control...

292
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:30,344
Remote controlling it from inside your pocket.

293
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:33,044
And this is...

294
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:35,044
It's the image of the security camera

295
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:37,844
that was set up in the underground casino.

296
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,944
I asked the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

297
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,344
to figure out who killed my son.

298
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:46,044
You recorded your own voice that you processed

299
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:47,844
and played it with the remote controller,

300
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:52,444
and acted out a client with no face.

301
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:55,244
You did it wanting to avenge the death of your son?

302
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:58,544
What clowns we were.

303
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,344
I gave birth to him when I was 15.

304
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:04,644
Sending him out to a foster home

305
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:07,744
wanting him to lead a normal life was my mistake.

306
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:09,344
On top of becoming a delinquent,

307
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:12,944
he was hired even without knowing who I was.

308
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:14,744
How ironic.

309
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,744
Sorry, Mr. Detective.

310
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,844
I'm sorry for getting you messed up in this too, sonny.

311
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:40,944
I'll instruct the killer to stop the deal right away.

312
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:42,444
Are you sure?

313
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,044
What're you doing?

314
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,144
Are you planning to die with them?

315
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:52,744
To compensate the death of your son?

316
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:54,444
If so, take a look!

317
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:58,744
Mr. Pimple is still alive!

318
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,544
Look carefully at his mouth.

319
00:19:00,544 --> 00:19:02,244
He saying something.

320
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:14,244
Mother, don't already. Cut it out.

321
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:25,944
It seems he knew that you, Ms. Lip was in fact Mr. Head

322
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:28,644
and his mother as well.

323
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:32,744
Or it could be that he decided to deliberately get hired by you

324
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:35,244
to stop you from committing crimes.

325
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:37,844
No way.

326
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,744
If he's alive,

327
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,744
I'm sure he would stop you again like he did there.

328
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:02,344
-Mr. Mouri! -Conan!

329
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,144
Hey! Don't die!

330
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:07,344
You gotta contact the killer! Please...

331
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:08,544
Darn it!

332
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:24,944
Ran...

333
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,144
Ms. Ran Mouri?

334
00:20:57,144 --> 00:20:59,944
I've come for you.

335
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,144
Yes.

336
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:04,344
-Please get in. -Okay.

337
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:11,244
Don't get in! Ran!

338
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:23,044
Darn it!

339
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:24,444
Run for it!

340
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:30,944
Come here, you!

341
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,144
Dad?

342
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:39,444
Ran!

343
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,244
Are you all right?

344
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:42,844
Ran!

345
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:48,944
Dad, you're hurting me.

346
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:53,744
I was... I was so worried.

347
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,344
I made it.

348
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:58,844
Ms. Lip was shot by Mr. Eyes

349
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:02,444
and was taken to an emergency hospital

350
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,744
and somehow made it through.

351
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:07,644
The band of robbers was all arrested.

352
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:32,244
I really worried about both of you, you know.

353
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,844
Are you guys listening?

354
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:36,644
Dad? Conan?

355
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:39,944
I'm listening so give me another shot, will you?

356
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,544
I'm listening, so let me sleep.

357
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,144
What's with you two?

358
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:52,944
"Next Episode" -We formed a group

359
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:56,644
to protect the peace and safety of the people.

360
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,744
The silver detective squad!

361
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:01,744
What is it?

362
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:09,844
Which means, I'm you? Conan?

363
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:12,344
