1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,667
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,367
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,767
Feeling unpleasant early in the New Year.

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:06,967
Ran receives a love letter.

5
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:09,067
A crime gives extra jolt to a shocked heart.

6
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,667
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,267
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,267
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:00,177
And Kitada from Class C

10
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,177
-was brushed off. -Oh, was the girl Mouri?

11
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:03,977
Oh, Ran!

12
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,277
Are you going home already?

13
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:08,277
Sonoko. Yeah.

14
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:11,277
I'm thinking of making something good for Conan,

15
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:13,777
because I've been lazy making meals recently.

16
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:18,677
Is this what a young and beautiful high school girl should say?

17
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:20,377
How about you learn something from her, Suzuki?

18
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:22,577
Shut up!

19
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,577
Okay, I guess I'll go home too then.

20
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,877
Will you wait for me by the shoes box,

21
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:27,677
while I go get my bag?

22
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:29,177
Okay, I get it.

23
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,477
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

24
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:38,777
"Ms. Ran Mouri"

25
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:44,977
Don't tell me that this is?

26
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:46,177
What shall I do?

27
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:55,877
No. I guess I'll open it at home after all.

28
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,277
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran!

29
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:00,477
Huh? What's this?

30
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,677
Ms. Ran Mouri?

31
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:07,377
S.H.?

32
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:08,977
Hey, Ran this is...

33
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:13,177
It was in my shoes compartment. What shall I do?

34
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:14,877
What do you mean, what shall I do?

35
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:16,877
What else?

36
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:24,077
"Love Letter to Ran"

37
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:27,077
Quick, rip it open!

38
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:28,777
Hold your horses.

39
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:37,877
"Please forgive me for suddenly sending you a letter like this."

40
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:39,577
"When I think of you,"

41
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:42,177
"my heart beats so hard that I can't even sleep at night."

42
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:43,677
"Please meet me just once."

43
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:44,777
"Tomorrow after school,"

44
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:48,577
"I'll be waiting you in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

45
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,977
You did it, Ran! It's a love letter!

46
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:55,277
He's probably an under classman.

47
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,077
He doesn't know you already have Shinichi.

48
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,177
-Hey! Shinichi has nothing to do with this... -What!

49
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:04,577
I tell you! You can't even talk safely around here!

50
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,977
Sorry, sorry...

51
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,777
Let's go some place else!

52
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,377
Wait a second, Sonoko.

53
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,077
A love letter.

54
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:14,377
Come to think of it, I haven't received any recently.

55
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:15,877
How about you, Ran?

56
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:17,677
What do you mean?

57
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,777
Don't tell me this is the first time you received one.

58
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,177
It's my first.

59
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,877
Seriously?

60
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:27,077
I see, you're with Shinichi all the time

61
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,277
so nobody can approach you.

62
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,877
I said that Shinichi has nothing to do with this!

63
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:36,477
I wonder who he is?

64
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,777
What?

65
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,577
An alumni of the kendo club, maybe?

66
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:42,277
See, he's holding a wooden sword.

67
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:45,077
Never mind him, the love letter's more important!

68
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,677
-Let's go. -Hey!

69
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:53,577
And, what are you going to do?

70
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,777
You're going to Beika Park, aren't you?

71
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:57,677
What shall I do?

72
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,377
What are you troubled about?

73
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,577
Go and turn him down flat.

74
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:03,777
Tell him that you're already going with somebody.

75
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:06,077
Just because it doesn't have anything to do with you!

76
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:11,177
You really seemed troubled.

77
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,277
Yeah.

78
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:14,377
I guess I have no choice, leave it to me.

79
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:17,477
-Huh? -I'll refuse very nicely for you.

80
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:20,477
What are you going to refuse?

81
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:22,377
Oh, glasses kid!

82
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,377
What're you doing in a place like this?

83
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:27,377
You look very serious, Ran.

84
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:30,477
Well, of course, because we were talking about

85
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,477
the first love letter Ran ever got.

86
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:33,677
Love letter?

87
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:35,677
Sonoko.

88
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:37,377
My dear Ran,

89
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:41,477
I would like to hug you and kiss those cute little lips.

90
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:43,177
That's not true, Conan.

91
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,177
Nothing like that was written in the letter.

92
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:48,377
But, it's true that you received a love letter.

93
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:49,877
And who was it from?

94
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,177
Oh, so it bothers you.

95
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,577
You idiot, why would I be?

96
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:57,277
Maybe it does bother me a bit?

97
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,577
You're really something, kid.

98
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:02,277
It was from a freshman with the initials S.H.

99
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:03,977
A freshman?

100
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,277
It said that he wants to meet her tomorrow

101
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:08,077
after school in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

102
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,277
That's enough already, Sonoko.

103
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:11,477
Since Ran seems to be troubled,

104
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:15,677
I'm thinking of going in her place to refuse his request, understand?

105
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,377
Okay, I got it.

106
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,777
Really, when I'm in this situation...

107
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,077
Who on earth can it be?

108
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:22,177
What shall I do?

109
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:24,977
I wonder if I should really let Sonoko handle this?

110
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,677
If he's good looking, I'll make him mine.

111
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:33,777
I wonder what happened.

112
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:36,777
What's the matter?

113
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:37,977
Huh?

114
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:42,477
If you need help, you should ask her to help you.

115
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:46,177
Her father is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

116
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,977
Hey, Conan.

117
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,177
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:51,677
And her boyfriend is the high school detective,

119
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,877
Shinichi Kudo.

120
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:54,077
Sonoko.

121
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:56,177
I know Detective Mouri

122
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:59,277
as well as Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

123
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,877
I'm an alumni of Teitan High School.

124
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:03,177
You are?

125
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:05,677
We're sophomore.

126
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,277
What shall I do?

127
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,877
Since the little boy offered.

128
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,677
Maybe I should ask for help.

129
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:14,977
Yes. It's okay, isn't it, Ran?

130
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,577
Yes. Well, if it's okay with you...

131
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:20,177
We'll help you.

132
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,677
Please come in, although it's messy.

133
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,177
-Hello. -Hello.

134
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,877
That...

135
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:31,177
He's my husband. He died a year ago.

136
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,677
Of an illness.

137
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,977
He was hospitalized for half a year and tried to pull through

138
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:38,877
but he didn't make it.

139
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,077
The fact is...

140
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:47,777
it seems that someone came into the house while we were out.

141
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,277
Huh?

142
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:50,677
I was out from about 1 pm,

143
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:54,077
for about two hours with Yuta.

144
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:57,677
And I seemed to have forgotten to to lock that glass door.

145
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,577
Moreover...

146
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,877
I take the rent for this place to the landlord myself,

147
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:04,877
so I went to the bank this morning to withdraw

148
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,577
the money and put it in this envelope.

149
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:07,977
It seems that the envelope I had in here

150
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:10,677
was taken out once.

151
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,477
Taken out?

152
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:15,177
But everything was returned, the entire amount.

153
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:19,577
How do you know that it was taken out once?

154
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,777
Because of the fold mark,

155
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,377
despite it being new bills, right?

156
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,877
Right.

157
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,177
Although it's a very faint fold though.

158
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:28,877
See.

159
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,577
Also...

160
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,877
Although I always leave it here...

161
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:39,077
There are traces that this diary was read too.

162
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,777
There's still more.

163
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:42,677
The most obvious thing,

164
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:45,177
is that someone placed an incense stick here.

165
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:46,277
Huh?

166
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:49,577
Hey, the incense stick was still lit, right?

167
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,877
About how much was left of it?

168
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:54,477
Well, about half.

169
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:56,677
Which means that the incense stick was placed

170
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:59,177
there about 15 minutes ago,

171
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,777
because incense stick will keep burning for about 30 minutes.

172
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,977
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you, Conan?

173
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,977
This kid knows a lot about weird things.

174
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:09,177
But, I wonder what's going on?

175
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:12,677
Let's say that someone did come into the house.

176
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,177
The point is who, for what reason came into the house.

177
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:17,677
Maybe it was a stalker?

178
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,777
I mean going through somebody's diary.

179
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,477
But, other than my diary,

180
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,577
nothing else seems to have been looked into or taken.

181
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:26,277
Then it could've been a thief!

182
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:29,177
But, then the money wouldn't be returned.

183
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:33,477
Besides, it's unthinkable that a thief would offer incense either.

184
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:38,577
I felt kind of creepy so I called the officer

185
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,677
but was told that they have no way of investigating

186
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:42,977
if nothing was taken.

187
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,577
The incense stick.

188
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:47,077
That's what bothers me the most.

189
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:49,077
The culprit is her acquaintance,

190
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:52,377
or her husband's acquaintance.

191
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:55,177
Hey, how did you get to know your husband?

192
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,477
Conan!

193
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:00,177
He's a really precocious kid.

194
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:03,077
We used to be classmates in high school.

195
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:07,177
But, we didn't think much of each other during high school.

196
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:08,177
After graduating from university,

197
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:10,477
we happened to run into each other on the street,

198
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,977
and started going with each other.

199
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:14,677
Then, it's different from you, Ran.

200
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:16,377
Of course, it's different!

201
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:19,077
You said that your diary was read,

202
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,277
but what kind of things do you have written in it?

203
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:24,077
There's nothing special written in it.

204
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:27,477
Although I'm busy everyday working and taking care of my son,

205
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,677
I'll keep myself going thinking of my husband,

206
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,877
or something like that.

207
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:35,577
It must be really hard being alone, Yuriko.

208
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:40,777
There was a time when I thought of committing suicide.

209
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:44,277
But, I had my son,

210
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,777
and after recalling how hard my husband tried to live,

211
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:49,377
despite suffering through his illness,

212
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:51,777
I had second thoughts about doing so.

213
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,877
Not only my husband, but there are many people in this world,

214
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:57,177
who cannot live despite wanting to do so.

215
00:10:57,177 --> 00:11:00,377
I thought that I would never be forgiven

216
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:03,077
if I took my own life despite knowing this.

217
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:07,677
I can't help but cry.

218
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,277
Maybe,

219
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:14,377
the culprit felt the same way we feel now.

220
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:17,077
If so, the culprit...

221
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,877
Just the other day,

222
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,477
I saw news on TV that someone came in and robbed the house,

223
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:26,177
but changed his mind and left without taking anything.

224
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:27,777
Really, Conan?

225
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:29,177
Yes, it was the house of a teacher

226
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:32,577
that had taken good care of him when he was a child

227
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:36,077
and he went in without knowing about it.

228
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:39,877
-Yuriko, are you a school teacher... -No, I'm not.

229
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:43,877
But even if you weren't a teacher, you could be somebody they know.

230
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,477
More to the point, you could be somebody special to them.

231
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:49,577
Maybe I should start writing a diary too.

232
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:53,477
Moreover, the culprit read the diary of that special person!

233
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:57,777
The diary of someone who is living with all her might despite her plight.

234
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:00,277
I see! That's why he didn't take anything,

235
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:02,577
offered incense and left!

236
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:04,177
That's right.

237
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:05,977
That special person could be someone

238
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:09,977
that sent you a love letter during your high school days.

239
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,377
Come off it, Sonoko.

240
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,277
I'm seriously thinking this incident over, you know!

241
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:15,177
I'm serious too!

242
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,877
What do you think?

243
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:21,977
Well, yes. I received such a letter just once.

244
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,377
When?

245
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,177
In January of my senior year.

246
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,577
But, we never talked to each other,

247
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,177
knew each other's face or name either.

248
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,477
We were never in the same class

249
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,477
all through our years during high school.

250
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:39,177
But, it seems he used to always watch me,

251
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:41,377
and it was just that I never noticed.

252
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:44,177
Indeed genuine one-sided love.

253
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,277
In the letter it said,

254
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:49,177
"Please meet me in front of the fountain at Beika Park."

255
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,277
What?

256
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,877
Huh? What?

257
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,977
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

258
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:55,877
And? Did you go?

259
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,677
I wasn't sure what to do,

260
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,777
but he was waiting for me there

261
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,177
so, I told him how I honestly felt.

262
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,877
What did you say?

263
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:07,777
I think I said, "I'm really happy of how you feel for me,"

264
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:10,577
"but my head is filled with wanting to pass the entrance exam for now."

265
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:14,877
He went home without saying a word.

266
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:17,077
"Graduation memorial album"

267
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:19,677
Let's see...

268
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:20,777
He's the one.

269
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:23,677
"Shuhei Nagai" -Mr. Shuhei Nagai.

270
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,077
Wait a second, this man...

271
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:43,324
Nagai came to our high school?

272
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:47,224
Yuriko, weren't you in the kendo club?

273
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,524
Yes.

274
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:50,924
-I was captain of the club in my sophomore year. -Mama!

275
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,224
Just as I thought!

276
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:53,524
So, that does it!

277
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:54,724
What?

278
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:57,724
Most likely, he's the one who broke into your house.

279
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,724
I agree too.

280
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:05,424
Yuriko, haven't you heard anything about him after you graduated?

281
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:09,124
I think it was about two years ago.

282
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:11,324
I heard a bit about him from my husband's friend.

283
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:14,324
I haven't told anyone about Nagai, including my husband,

284
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:16,724
so when my husband and his friend was talking,

285
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,524
Nagai's subject came up as someone who went to school in the same year.

286
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,424
He stayed out of university for a year,

287
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,924
but, despite that couldn't get into the university of his choice.

288
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:25,924
Even after graduation,

289
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,724
he ended up working for a company he didn't like.

290
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,224
As a result, he quit the company

291
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:32,724
and seems to be doing freelance work now.

292
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:36,124
Could you have by any chance

293
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,824
entered a top-notch university just like that?

294
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,524
I don't know if it was top-notch or what,

295
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,924
but I did get into the university of my choice.

296
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,124
So, that's the story.

297
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:49,424
What is it, Sonoko?

298
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,724
Will you hear me out?

299
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,924
Hey, hey, are you know what you're doing?

300
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:58,024
I'm sure that Shuhei Nagai never forgot you

301
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:03,024
ever since he met you in front of the fountain at Beika Park.

302
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:06,924
But he probably couldn't contact you because he had inferiority complex

303
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,924
of not being able to enter a top-notch university like you did.

304
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,624
After that, even after going out into the society,

305
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,124
nothing worked out for him.

306
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:13,924
He finally runs out of money and comes back

307
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,524
to Beikacho where he knows his way around,

308
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:18,124
with the intention of breaking into a house.

309
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:20,224
While he goes around looking for the house of rich people,

310
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:21,824
most probably like mine,

311
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:25,024
he notices that the glass window of your house

312
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,324
is slightly opened.

313
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:31,724
And after finding out somehow that no one was home.

314
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:41,524
Then, he happened to notice.

315
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,324
The woman in the picture was who he had one-sidedly fallen in love with

316
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:45,924
during his high school days.

317
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:48,924
The man in the picture with her also looked familiar.

318
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:50,924
He was the classmate from same high school.

319
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,924
Moreover, seeing the picture on the altar,

320
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:56,124
he realizes that the classmate had passed away.

321
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,424
He then sees the diary,

322
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,024
although he knows he shouldn't he reads it.

323
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,924
He finds out that she is living

324
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,324
with all her might along with her little child.

325
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:11,824
He also thinks about his classmate who died at the young age of 20.

326
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:14,224
He is ashamed of himself for doing what he did,

327
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,524
being as young and healthy as he is.

328
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:22,124
When I watch Ran practicing karate with all her might,

329
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:25,124
myself sometimes think I've got to live with all my might too.

330
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:26,424
Sonoko.

331
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:31,924
Shuhei Nagai decides to start life all over again.

332
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,924
So he puts the money back into the envelope

333
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,324
and he offers incense stick in honour

334
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:40,324
for his classmates, then he leaves.

335
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:47,624
And, he made a final trip to the high school that the graduated

336
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:50,624
from vowing never to come back to this town again.

337
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:55,824
It just so happened that the kendo club was practicing.

338
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:01,824
Back then, he was recalling memories of you

339
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,824
and soaking in deep emotion.

340
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:07,324
So, he could be at Beika Park looking at the fountain just around now.

341
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,024
No.

342
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,724
You're fantastic, Sonoko!

343
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:14,724
It's very similar to mine.

344
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,424
Wait a second.

345
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:21,124
The Nagai that we saw in front of the gym

346
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,524
seemed a bit different from your deduction, Sonoko.

347
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:27,924
He seemed, well sort of, a bit more desperate.

348
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:29,524
Is that so?

349
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:33,524
Besides, it kind of bothered me that he was holding a wooden sword too.

350
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,124
-A wooden sword? -Yes.

351
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:41,324
Did you have anything else written in your diary?

352
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:44,124
To be honest,

353
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:48,224
there is one thing I didn't tell you all about.

354
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:51,124
Ten days ago, I had a slight accident

355
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:53,024
with a man who was riding a bicycle.

356
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:57,124
Back then, he told me that he was just fine,

357
00:17:57,124 --> 00:18:00,524
but he later came to tell me that he started having neck problems.

358
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:01,624
That's...

359
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:04,824
I told him that I'd pay for his medical bills,

360
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,824
but he asked me date with him

361
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,124
in place of paying for the medical bills.

362
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,424
He was very persistent.

363
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,924
How terrible!

364
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,724
He seemed to be of bad character,

365
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,224
so I was scared that if I refused too strongly,

366
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:18,824
he would to something to Yuta.

367
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:20,824
That's why I didn't tell anybody about this.

368
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,924
Where is that man today?

369
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:24,924
He's out on a business trip till sundown.

370
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:28,624
That's why I know it's not him who broke in.

371
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,924
Everything you just told us is written in your diary, isn't it?

372
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,324
Yes.

373
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:37,524
That man called Nagai had a wooden sword, didn't he?

374
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:38,624
Maybe...

375
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,724
What's with you?

376
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,624
Are you that woman's man?

377
00:18:49,624 --> 00:18:51,424
No!

378
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,324
Stay, stay away from her.

379
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:59,624
Keep your hands off her son too.

380
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:02,124
What? I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

381
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,024
Why you?

382
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:15,524
"Ryujin Real Estate Company"

383
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,524
Conan?

384
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:26,924
Hey, hey! Are you gone already?

385
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:30,424
-Don't touch her. -What?

386
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:34,724
Don't go near her.

387
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,824
What? I can't hear you.

388
00:19:36,824 --> 00:19:38,024
Nagai!

389
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,524
What's with you guys?

390
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,524
What is it, kid?

391
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:52,624
Hey, it's strange, mister.

392
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,124
Your neck moves?

393
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,524
-You filthy kid! -A scum like you!

394
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,724
What do you want young lady?

395
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:09,824
Your neck is really in trouble now, mister!

396
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:11,124
Nagai!

397
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:15,624
Are you all right, Nagai?

398
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,624
I'm sorry, I...

399
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:19,524
Read your diary.

400
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:21,724
It's okay, you don't have to say anything.

401
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:22,924
I...

402
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:25,824
Wanted to help you.

403
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,224
11 years ago.

404
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:30,424
Huh?

405
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:33,924
11 years ago, I was really happy

406
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:35,924
when you came to the park.

407
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:40,624
I didn't think you would come.

408
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,424
Nagai.

409
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:52,824
I'll go see him myself, after all.

410
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:54,124
What?

411
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:56,424
Well, I don't know how to put it,

412
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:59,324
but I'll tell him how I honestly feel.

413
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:03,324
I think that I should act in good faith to the one who sent me the letter.

414
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,624
Yes. I think it's best you do too.

415
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,324
"Beika Park"

416
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,924
I made it.

417
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:54,124
Jeez.

418
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,524
Ran was saying that

419
00:22:56,524 --> 00:23:00,324
she's going to tell the guy how she honestly feels.

420
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:02,424
I wonder if she's going to tell him about me...

421
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:09,724
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,224
I wrote that I'd be waiting here

423
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,924
and yet I made you wait instead.

424
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,524
Which means...

425
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,824
What?

426
00:23:16,824 --> 00:23:20,524
I'm your fan, the captain of the karate club!

427
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,124
Please accept this.

428
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:23,624
Thank you.

429
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:25,824
Please keep up your good work!

430
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:26,924
Goodbye!

431
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,624
What's going on?

432
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:33,624
It wasn't a freshman boy.

433
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:36,124
Sonoko? Conan too?

434
00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:40,224
I thought that today for sure

435
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:41,824
I would be able to hear how you truly feel and yet.

436
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,324
Too bad!

437
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:46,324
But popular with girls,

438
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,724
just as expected of you, Ran!

439
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:03,424
"Next Episode" -A girl that resembles Haibara!

440
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:05,724
She got involved in some sort of accident

441
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,324
or maybe...

442
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:10,624
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

443
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:13,624
That accident...

444
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:15,424
When did that traffic accident happen?

445
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:25,924
Next Conan,

446
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:29,824
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

447
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,851
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,851
"A girl who looks like Ai Haibara"

449
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:37,251
Haibara, you sure act like an adult.

450
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:39,651
I'll bet you're lying about your age.
