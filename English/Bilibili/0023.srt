1
00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:05.605
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:08.605
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.605
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:14.765
A review of the last episode
will accompany the theme song!

5
00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:18.525
It's a big ship, but there's
always only one truth!

6
00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:53.957
We were nearly stranded on an island

7
00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:57.247
before we were picked up by a ship
that the Hatamoto family had reserved.

8
00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:01.667
Including the three of us and the butler,
there were only 10 people onboard.

9
00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:03.877
On our way back to land,
Hatamoto Gozo,

10
00:02:04.247 --> 00:02:06.837
head of the Hatamoto family,
was murdered in his room.

11
00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:09.247
The main suspect was Hatamoto Takeshi,

12
00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:11.087
who entered the family
by marrying Hatamoto Natsue.

13
00:02:11.747 --> 00:02:14.287
He turned out to be
the son of Zaiki Isao,

14
00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:18.907
who killed himself after Gozo took over
his company 10 years earlier!

15
00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:23.077
Since he had a motive, everyone decided
to lock Takeshi in a storeroom.

16
00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:27.067
It looked like the case was closed,
but there was more to come.

17
00:02:27.407 --> 00:02:30.907
Hatamoto Tatsuo, Akie's husband,
was found dead,

18
00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:33.507
and Takeshi had escaped
from the storeroom!

19
00:02:38.037 --> 00:02:41.477
The Luxury Liner Murders, Part 2.

20
00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:51.207
Tatsuo!

21
00:02:51.207 --> 00:02:51.967
Akie...

22
00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:52.587
Hatamoto Akie

23
00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:53.867
It's your fault!
Hatamoto Akie

24
00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:55.157
Eh?
Hatamoto Akie

25
00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:55.477
This never would've happened
Hatamoto Akie

26
00:02:55.477 --> 00:02:56.207
This never would've happened

27
00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:58.907
if you hadn't brought Takeshi
into our family!

28
00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.177
What do you have to say for yourself?!

29
00:03:01.177 --> 00:03:03.537
Hatamoto Kitaro
Hatamoto Ichiro
You certainly are lucky!

30
00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:04.457
Now that Takeshi's killed Father,
Hatamoto Kitaro
Hatamoto Ichiro

31
00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:06.117
Now that Takeshi's killed Father,

32
00:03:06.117 --> 00:03:09.857
all of his fortune belongs to you!

33
00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:13.697
You can't be serious!
I don't care about his fortune!

34
00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:17.947
We're still not certain that Takeshi-san
is the one responsible, you know.

35
00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:21.787
Conan-kun!

36
00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:25.657
The storeroom door was unlocked
when we checked it out, right?

37
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.997
Yeah, that's right...

38
00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:30.707
He couldn't have gotten out

39
00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:31.837
unless someone unlocked it
from the outside.

40
00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:34.247
That's right...

41
00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.367
There were no signs of damage
on the door, either...

42
00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.827
So if someone did unlock it,

43
00:03:38.827 --> 00:03:40.967
then he has an accomplice in this room!

44
00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:54.987
Hatamoto Takeshi

45
00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.787
So let me get this straight.

46
00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:01.657
At the time of Tatsuo-san's murder,

47
00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:02.117
Hatamoto Joji

48
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.117
the three of you were alone
in your private rooms,
Hatamoto Joji

49
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:09.127
while you two were together
in your shared room.

50
00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:13.207
Well, I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a little walk...

51
00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:16.157
Which means that just
like the first murder,

52
00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:19.157
aside from everyone
who was with Natsue-san,

53
00:04:19.157 --> 00:04:21.157
nobody here has an alibi!

54
00:04:21.157 --> 00:04:25.117
You gotta be kidding me!
My husband just died!

55
00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:27.137
Why am I a suspect?!

56
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:32.607
You're the one who's
happiest to see him dead.

57
00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:38.197
I know that you've been
seeing other men!

58
00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:42.407
You had a big enough reason
to kill Grandfather!

59
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.707
You're the one who wanted
his inheritance the most!

60
00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:49.167
Stop it, you two! Please!

61
00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:56.157
Did you draw that, Ichiro-san?

62
00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.967
That's Natsue-san, isn't it?

63
00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:01.827
And your son Ichiro isn't exempt either!

64
00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:02.807
Am I wrong?

65
00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:05.457
I'm sure he was pretty pissed

66
00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:08.267
after Grandfather tore up
his prize-winning drawing!

67
00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:12.687
That was Father's fault--
he never recognized this boy's talent!

68
00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:16.247
Tatsuo always made fun of you, didn't he?

69
00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:18.027
"Depressed introvert"
and stuff like that...

70
00:05:18.577 --> 00:05:21.867
No! I didn't kill him!

71
00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:25.407
And the one who wanted to be
free of Grandfather the most...

72
00:05:25.957 --> 00:05:28.657
...was you, Uncle Kitaro!

73
00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:30.407
What?

74
00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:31.827
Ichiro! Where are you going?

75
00:05:32.327 --> 00:05:33.407
The restroom.

76
00:05:33.407 --> 00:05:35.207
Will you be alright by yourself?

77
00:05:35.207 --> 00:05:40.037
I'll be fine. I'm not
a weakling like my father!

78
00:05:40.037 --> 00:05:40.967
Ichiro...

79
00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.827
Hey, Mr. Butler...

80
00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:47.077
Did something happen
between Kitaro-san and Gozo-san?

81
00:05:47.077 --> 00:05:51.307
Kitaro-sama has wanted to leave
the Hatamoto family for a long time.

82
00:05:51.827 --> 00:05:55.617
He says he doesn't have the ambition
to run the family company.

83
00:05:55.617 --> 00:05:58.737
Gozo-sama was greatly
opposed to the idea...

84
00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:01.497
But even if he wasn't against it,

85
00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:04.857
I don't think his wife Mariko-sama
would have allowed it either...

86
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.367
Detective!

87
00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:13.707
It's been 20 minutes, but Ichiro
still isn't back from the restroom!

88
00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:15.667
Don't tell me Takeshi got him!

89
00:06:21.077 --> 00:06:23.247
Calm down! Stay where you are!

90
00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:26.657
What?! But Ichiro isn't back yet!

91
00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:27.657
Ichiro!

92
00:06:27.657 --> 00:06:29.597
You mustn't leave the room, ma'am!

93
00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:31.977
Conan and Ran! Are you there?!

94
00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:33.547
Dad?!

95
00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:34.647
Over here!

96
00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:36.797
I'm going to the electrical room!

97
00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:39.067
You two head for the restroom!

98
00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:41.967
The restrooms were this way, right?

99
00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.087
Yeah.

100
00:06:44.547 --> 00:06:46.527
Wasn't that Ichiro-san's voice?!

101
00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:48.047
Dammit!

102
00:06:50.547 --> 00:06:51.457
Ow!

103
00:06:54.127 --> 00:06:55.207
Ichiro!

104
00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:56.957
My leg!

105
00:06:57.547 --> 00:06:59.547
Hang in there, Ichiro!

106
00:06:59.547 --> 00:07:01.207
He's alright! The wound isn't deep!

107
00:07:01.207 --> 00:07:02.837
We need to bandage it up right away!

108
00:07:02.837 --> 00:07:04.677
I'll get the first-aid kit!

109
00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:07.707
Who did this to you?!

110
00:07:07.707 --> 00:07:08.917
I don't know...

111
00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:13.507
The lights suddenly went out
and then I sensed someone come in...

112
00:07:13.507 --> 00:07:15.457
And then they stabbed me!

113
00:07:18.457 --> 00:07:19.147
That's...

114
00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.067
...My knife.

115
00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:25.587
Don't tell me you did this, Joji!

116
00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:27.707
Hold on!

117
00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:30.507
I was with you all in the dining room
when the power went out!

118
00:07:30.507 --> 00:07:31.787
I couldn't have done this!

119
00:07:32.127 --> 00:07:33.707
That's true...

120
00:07:33.707 --> 00:07:35.997
There is only one person
who could have done it!

121
00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:38.957
Takeshi-kun!

122
00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:42.207
No, that's not necessarily the case.

123
00:07:42.207 --> 00:07:45.547
Let Natsue-san and Ran take care
of Ichiro-kun's bandage.

124
00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:48.887
I'd like the rest of you to come
to the electrical room with me.

125
00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.547
Is there something here?

126
00:07:53.547 --> 00:07:55.807
Yes. Have a look for yourself.

127
00:07:56.797 --> 00:07:58.767
What is this?

128
00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:01.377
It's a type of timing device.

129
00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:03.737
This one is simple enough
for anyone to set up.

130
00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:07.797
You attach a heavy weight to the breaker,
balance it around a fulcrum,

131
00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:10.737
and then put a candle in the middle.

132
00:08:10.737 --> 00:08:14.537
After enough time passes,
the rope burns apart,

133
00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:17.077
which causes the weight
to pull down on the breaker.

134
00:08:17.547 --> 00:08:19.837
Judging from how much
of the candle has melted,

135
00:08:19.837 --> 00:08:22.167
this was all set up quite a while ago.

136
00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:26.877
In other words, any one of you could
be responsible for the power outage.

137
00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:31.627
At any rate, I'll take the responsibility
of finding Takeshi-san.

138
00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:35.977
Until I do, I don't want any of you
to take a step out of the dining room!

139
00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:51.737
Does it hurt, Ichiro?!

140
00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:54.337
Damn it...

141
00:08:54.337 --> 00:08:56.917
I can't believe we've looked this
hard but still haven't found him!

142
00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:59.337
Then maybe he's not
on the ship anymore?

143
00:08:59.337 --> 00:09:02.337
I don't think we've
searched everywhere yet...

144
00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:05.547
Like everyone's rooms!

145
00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:14.807
He's not in Kitaro-san's room.

146
00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:20.737
These two seem to have rather
different personalities.

147
00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:22.107
Is their marriage holding up well?

148
00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:26.567
Yes. They're both cousins,
and although it may not look like it,

149
00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.447
they've been good friends
since they were little.

150
00:09:29.717 --> 00:09:32.157
They're cousins and they're married?!

151
00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:34.927
Yes. Come to think of it,

152
00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:37.617
Gozo-sama was extremely
opposed to them, too.

153
00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:40.077
"Them, too"?

154
00:09:45.257 --> 00:09:48.717
Doesn't look like he's
in Joji-san's room, either.

155
00:09:49.507 --> 00:09:52.717
Hey, is this his knife case?

156
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.677
What?!

157
00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:59.227
Two of his knives are missing!

158
00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:00.967
What does it mean?

159
00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:04.967
One knife we found right
after Ichiro-kun was attacked,

160
00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:06.187
but where's the other one?

161
00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:11.427
This must be Ichiro-san's room!

162
00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:13.677
See? These are his drawings!

163
00:10:13.677 --> 00:10:16.217
That's no reason to
enter the room carelessly!

164
00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:19.367
Takeshi-kun could be hiding
in here with a weapon!

165
00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:22.217
Wow, he's really good!

166
00:10:22.217 --> 00:10:25.677
Who knows, maybe there's a drawing
of the murder scene here!

167
00:10:27.217 --> 00:10:28.507
Yeah, right.

168
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:35.477
Hey now, don't touch those!

169
00:10:35.477 --> 00:10:36.387
Alright.

170
00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:41.967
He's not in here, either.

171
00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:43.477
It would seem not.

172
00:10:44.007 --> 00:10:45.847
Hey, what's this?

173
00:10:45.847 --> 00:10:48.187
Charcoal. You use it for rough sketches.

174
00:10:48.677 --> 00:10:49.647
Then what's this?

175
00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:52.987
Hey, get the lead out. We're moving on.

176
00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:55.257
Coming!

177
00:10:55.257 --> 00:10:57.327
It's an ordinary eraser.

178
00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.287
I see...

179
00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:06.007
He wasn't in our rooms
or in Natsue-san's room.

180
00:11:06.007 --> 00:11:08.957
All that's left is
Akie-san's room here...

181
00:11:11.427 --> 00:11:13.677
I guess he's not on the ship anymore...

182
00:11:16.457 --> 00:11:18.277
Did you find something?

183
00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:20.347
No! Nothing at all!

184
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.907
Oh well.

185
00:11:21.907 --> 00:11:24.307
Let's return to the dining room for now.

186
00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:31.027
Hey, Mr. Butler.

187
00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:32.417
Do you know if...?

188
00:11:35.657 --> 00:11:36.947
Did that ever happen?

189
00:11:37.287 --> 00:11:42.197
How did you find out?
Only Gozo-sama and I know about that!

190
00:11:42.197 --> 00:11:44.867
So I'm right!

191
00:11:44.867 --> 00:11:47.617
The first incident,
in which Mr. Gozo was killed...

192
00:11:47.617 --> 00:11:51.957
The bread found near the body,
and the location of the murder weapon...

193
00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:54.957
The second incident,
in which Tatsuo-san was killed...

194
00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:58.747
The splash and thud sounds I heard
at the time of the murder...

195
00:11:58.747 --> 00:12:01.677
The person who unlocked
the storeroom door...

196
00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:05.807
And then the third incident, in which
Ichiro-san was stabbed in the dark...

197
00:12:06.907 --> 00:12:09.867
Each of these mysteries is connected
by a single thread!

198
00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:25.968
Hey, come here a sec!

199
00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:29.428
What is it?

200
00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:31.718
Did you find something?

201
00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:39.808
Sorry, old man!

202
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.718
Huh? Where's Dad?

203
00:12:44.718 --> 00:12:46.428
He has something important to say,

204
00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:50.158
so he wants everyone to come
to Akie-san's room in 10 minutes.

205
00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:51.698
Something important to say?

206
00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:54.448
Tell the others!

207
00:12:58.218 --> 00:13:00.878
Come on! Come on!

208
00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:03.878
The old man's voice is ♪59...

209
00:13:05.048 --> 00:13:06.838
You know who did it?!

210
00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:12.298
Yes. Someone on this ship was
responsible for all three incidents.

211
00:13:12.298 --> 00:13:14.928
Who is it?!

212
00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:16.698
It's obviously him!

213
00:13:16.698 --> 00:13:18.268
It was Takeshi's doing!

214
00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:20.348
Now, now, just calm down...

215
00:13:20.348 --> 00:13:24.728
Before I reveal the killer's name,
let us look at the incidents again.

216
00:13:24.728 --> 00:13:28.008
First was Incident ♪1, in which
Mr. Gozo was murdered in his room,

217
00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:30.658
which had been locked from the inside.

218
00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:33.618
From the fact that there
was blood on the doorframe,

219
00:13:33.618 --> 00:13:37.348
Mr. Gozo likely escaped back into
his room after he was stabbed outside.

220
00:13:37.348 --> 00:13:42.168
He then locked the door,
but fell lifeless soon after.

221
00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:45.628
We later found a flower on the ground
in front of the room!

222
00:13:45.628 --> 00:13:49.388
Yeah! Takeshi was wearing it!

223
00:13:49.388 --> 00:13:50.838
That means he did it!

224
00:13:50.838 --> 00:13:54.048
But there is one strange detail.

225
00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:57.298
Even though Mr. Gozo was
stabbed outside his room,

226
00:13:57.298 --> 00:13:59.598
there were no blood marks
in the hallway.

227
00:13:59.598 --> 00:14:01.928
Are you sure the killer
didn't wipe it up

228
00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:04.558
to delay us from
discovering the corpse?

229
00:14:04.558 --> 00:14:06.348
I'm not refuting that fact--

230
00:14:06.348 --> 00:14:10.568
I'm just saying that the flower fell
after the blood was wiped up!

231
00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:12.508
I can understand if the
killer accidentally dropped it

232
00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:15.048
while stabbing the victim
and then escaping...

233
00:14:15.048 --> 00:14:17.328
But the killer meticulously
wiped up the blood.

234
00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:21.468
By leaving the flower there,
everyone would've noticed it.

235
00:14:21.468 --> 00:14:24.248
Especially if it was dropped
during the middle of cleaning.

236
00:14:24.538 --> 00:14:28.248
In other words, the killer purposely
left the flower on the ground

237
00:14:28.248 --> 00:14:30.878
in order to make
Takeshi-san look guilty.

238
00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:35.578
Next is Incident ♪2, in which
Tatsuo-san was murdered on the deck.

239
00:14:35.578 --> 00:14:38.158
Unlike the first incident
with its flower

240
00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:40.888
and the third incident
with its fancy set-up,

241
00:14:40.888 --> 00:14:43.458
this incident lacked
any sort of artificiality.

242
00:14:44.348 --> 00:14:47.198
If these were all indeed
done by the same person,

243
00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:54.278
my guess is that the
2nd murder was an unplanned one.

244
00:14:54.278 --> 00:14:57.738
Now then, why was Tatsuo-san murdered?

245
00:14:57.738 --> 00:15:01.198
The answer to that question
is in this case.

246
00:15:01.198 --> 00:15:04.168
That's my knife case!

247
00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:07.448
Have a look. Two knives are missing.

248
00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:10.408
We found one of them
at the scene of Incident ♪3,

249
00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:12.048
but where did the other one go?

250
00:15:12.048 --> 00:15:16.868
The main point here is in
the two sounds that Conan heard.

251
00:15:16.868 --> 00:15:20.748
The thud was likely the sound
of the killer striking Tatsuo-san,

252
00:15:20.748 --> 00:15:23.268
but what was the splash
that came before it?

253
00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.908
Here's what I'm thinking--

254
00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:30.818
the splash sound was the
other knife from this case.

255
00:15:30.818 --> 00:15:33.698
If Tatsuo-san just happened
to see it thrown overboard,

256
00:15:33.698 --> 00:15:36.868
the killer could have killed
him to keep things quiet.

257
00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:38.698
That would make the most sense.

258
00:15:39.078 --> 00:15:43.868
But Takeshi vanished from the storeroom
after the 2nd incident!

259
00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:46.118
Yeah! Takeshi is the
most suspicious here!

260
00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:51.158
No, that storeroom door
was locked from the outside.

261
00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:53.328
Escape would have been impossible

262
00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:54.128
unless someone unlocked it for him!

263
00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:56.118
Who was it then?!

264
00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:57.508
Who opened it?!

265
00:15:57.878 --> 00:16:00.798
The killer.

266
00:16:00.798 --> 00:16:03.338
Tatsuo-san's murder wasn't
part of the killer's plan,

267
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.958
and it took place
while Takeshi-san was locked up.

268
00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.838
The killer worked so hard to
make Takeshi-san look guilty,

269
00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:13.478
but this 2nd murder would do just
the opposite and prove his innocence.

270
00:16:13.478 --> 00:16:16.528
So the killer unlocked the door.

271
00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:20.088
This was done to make it
look like Takeshi-san

272
00:16:20.088 --> 00:16:22.738
had the ability to murder
Tatsuo-san, as well.

273
00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:26.088
Then why did Takeshi-san run away?!

274
00:16:26.088 --> 00:16:28.248
Yeah! We still haven't found him!

275
00:16:28.248 --> 00:16:31.168
Let's have him explain that himself.

276
00:16:31.548 --> 00:16:36.378
Takeshi-san. Why don't you
stop hiding and come out?

277
00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:38.508
He's in this room?!

278
00:16:40.628 --> 00:16:41.928
Takeshi-san!

279
00:16:49.498 --> 00:16:51.168
Takeshi-san!

280
00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:55.648
Now then, tell us what happened
when you escaped from the storeroom.

281
00:16:55.648 --> 00:16:59.668
I thought something
happened to Natsue...

282
00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:01.118
I couldn't stand around doing nothing,

283
00:17:01.118 --> 00:17:04.668
and as I was pounding on the door,
it suddenly unlocked.

284
00:17:04.668 --> 00:17:06.118
I ran out of there!

285
00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:08.538
And then when I went up to the deck...

286
00:17:08.538 --> 00:17:11.248
Takeshi did it again!

287
00:17:11.248 --> 00:17:13.548
Tatsuo!

288
00:17:13.548 --> 00:17:15.668
Realizing that I would be blamed again,

289
00:17:16.128 --> 00:17:18.458
I ran into Akie-san's room,
whose door just happened to be open.

290
00:17:19.418 --> 00:17:22.138
After that, I stayed inside
the closet the entire time.

291
00:17:22.418 --> 00:17:25.498
So the person who stabbed
Ichiro-san during Incident ♪3

292
00:17:25.498 --> 00:17:26.928
wasn't him either...

293
00:17:27.418 --> 00:17:28.998
Who was it?!

294
00:17:28.998 --> 00:17:31.058
Why would they do something
this horrible to Ichiro?!

295
00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:35.748
Because the killer made a big mistake.

296
00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:36.528
Mistake?

297
00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:39.948
Yes. Unlocking the storeroom door.

298
00:17:40.798 --> 00:17:43.798
The killer had managed
to frame Takeshi-san,

299
00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:48.118
but now it looked like he had
an accomplice who had let him out!

300
00:17:48.118 --> 00:17:51.998
It wasn't until then that anyone
started to suspect the real killer!

301
00:17:51.998 --> 00:17:55.588
Flustered, the murderer
came up with a scheme

302
00:17:55.588 --> 00:17:57.748
to avoid any further suspicion...

303
00:17:57.748 --> 00:18:02.008
Incident ♪3, in which Ichiro-san
was attacked in the restroom.

304
00:18:03.748 --> 00:18:08.428
But it was in this incident that
the killer dug his own grave.

305
00:18:09.168 --> 00:18:13.878
In the darkness, the killer shouldn't
have been able to see Ichiro-kun.

306
00:18:13.878 --> 00:18:17.898
Even so, he was clearly able to see
Ichiro-kun well enough to stab him.

307
00:18:17.898 --> 00:18:19.898
How could that be?

308
00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:22.858
Moreover, the weapon was found
lying at the scene of the crime.

309
00:18:23.498 --> 00:18:29.378
Unlike the first two incidents,
the attacker didn't leave with the weapon!

310
00:18:29.378 --> 00:18:32.628
No, the attacker couldn't
have left with it.

311
00:18:32.628 --> 00:18:37.298
After all, he couldn't go anywhere
with his injured leg.

312
00:18:38.878 --> 00:18:40.468
You don't mean to say--

313
00:18:40.468 --> 00:18:41.838
That's right.

314
00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:44.968
The person who stabbed him...
was Ichiro-kun himself!

315
00:18:44.968 --> 00:18:49.798
And the one who killed
Mr. Gozo and Tatsuo-san...

316
00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:54.148
...was you, Ichiro-kun!

317
00:18:56.608 --> 00:18:57.768
Ichiro...

318
00:18:58.068 --> 00:19:00.198
The reason you put the lights out

319
00:19:00.198 --> 00:19:03.698
was because you didn't want
to identify your attacker.

320
00:19:03.698 --> 00:19:09.398
If you said it was Takeshi-san
and then he was found innocent later,

321
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.118
then all the suspicion
would fall onto you.

322
00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:14.708
This is all conjecture!

323
00:19:15.148 --> 00:19:17.838
Do you have any evidence
that Ichiro's the murderer?!

324
00:19:17.838 --> 00:19:20.028
This is the evidence.

325
00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:25.298
The piece of bread that was
found near Mr. Gozo's body.

326
00:19:25.298 --> 00:19:27.388
A piece of bread?

327
00:19:27.988 --> 00:19:29.988
Ichiro-san is an art student.

328
00:19:29.988 --> 00:19:33.028
And right before Mr. Gozo was murdered,

329
00:19:33.028 --> 00:19:34.848
he was drawing a picture on the deck.

330
00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:38.858
Bread pieces are sometimes used
as erasers for charcoal sketches,

331
00:19:38.858 --> 00:19:41.438
and I hear that these pieces
often fall into artists' cuffs.

332
00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:46.408
When he stabbed Mr. Gozo,
that piece of bread fell out of his cuff.

333
00:19:47.108 --> 00:19:49.868
It fell onto Mr. Gozo's blood, you see.

334
00:19:50.318 --> 00:19:54.398
What's more, this bread piece
has a tiny bit of charcoal on it.

335
00:19:54.398 --> 00:19:57.788
There is no doubt that it was
Ichiro-kun who dropped it!

336
00:19:57.788 --> 00:20:00.168
But he has no motive!

337
00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:02.858
Ichiro had no reason to kill Father!

338
00:20:02.858 --> 00:20:07.238
I, myself, couldn't tell what
his motive was until the very end.

339
00:20:07.238 --> 00:20:10.138
Until I saw something
in his room, that is.

340
00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.348
Something in his room?!

341
00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:14.238
This.

342
00:20:14.238 --> 00:20:18.358
This is Ichiro-kun's motive
for killing Mr. Gozo.

343
00:20:20.108 --> 00:20:21.898
How is a picture his motive?

344
00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:23.728
The answer is in the drawing itself.

345
00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:26.228
I don't see how...

346
00:20:27.448 --> 00:20:28.448
Stop it...

347
00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:30.618
Stop it!

348
00:20:31.448 --> 00:20:34.868
Wait! All these drawings are of Natsue!

349
00:20:40.898 --> 00:20:43.838
Ichiro! Don't tell me you--

350
00:20:44.238 --> 00:20:45.488
That's right.

351
00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:49.788
Ichiro-kun was in love
with Natsue-san.

352
00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:53.808
Ichiro-san...

353
00:20:54.318 --> 00:20:57.108
I heard from Suzuki-san, the butler.

354
00:20:57.108 --> 00:21:00.448
Unable to reveal
your feelings to Natsue-san,

355
00:21:00.448 --> 00:21:01.518
you went to Mr. Gozo and--

356
00:21:01.518 --> 00:21:07.398
It's true! I asked him
to let me marry Natsue-san!

357
00:21:07.398 --> 00:21:09.778
But he wouldn't hear me out!

358
00:21:10.528 --> 00:21:13.568
He refused to give his beloved
Natsue-san to someone like me!

359
00:21:13.568 --> 00:21:16.398
And soon after that,
almost as if to spite me,

360
00:21:16.398 --> 00:21:19.708
he announced that Natsue-san
was going to marry Takeshi-san!

361
00:21:20.648 --> 00:21:24.278
And then when he yelled at me yesterday

362
00:21:24.278 --> 00:21:26.588
while I was on the deck,
drawing Natsue-san...

363
00:21:27.198 --> 00:21:30.298
Tell him to give up
his hopeless dream!

364
00:21:30.298 --> 00:21:32.988
I couldn't forgive them!

365
00:21:32.988 --> 00:21:36.468
Not my grandfather, who refused
to let me marry Natsue-san...

366
00:21:36.808 --> 00:21:43.458
Nor Takeshi-san, who stole
my Natsue-san away from me!

367
00:23:23.288 --> 00:23:24.278
Takeshi-san.

368
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:29.208
Do you still feel the same way
toward my grandfather and us?

369
00:23:29.698 --> 00:23:32.798
I am the son of Zaiki Isao,

370
00:23:32.798 --> 00:23:37.028
who committed suicide after the
Hatamoto Group took over his company.

371
00:23:37.028 --> 00:23:41.148
And it's true that I got close to you
because I hated your grandfather.

372
00:23:41.148 --> 00:23:43.848
But ever since I met you...

373
00:23:48.278 --> 00:23:51.318
The tragedy was caused
by a shy young man

374
00:23:51.318 --> 00:23:54.188
who was unable to put his
secret thoughts into words...

375
00:23:56.078 --> 00:23:59.228
The ship is nearing Tokyo...

376
00:23:59.228 --> 00:24:03.548
...while being bathed by the red sunset
that is the sadness and despair

377
00:24:03.548 --> 00:24:05.458
of Ichiro-san and the
entire Hatamoto family.

378
00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:22.758
She has...

379
00:24:22.758 --> 00:24:24.018
...Amnesia?!

380
00:24:25.678 --> 00:24:26.728
That's him!

381
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.508
Why is the man from the racetrack

382
00:24:34.508 --> 00:24:36.068
after Maya-san?!

383
00:24:37.258 --> 00:24:38.678
On the next Conan--

384
00:24:38.678 --> 00:24:41.258
The Case of the
Mysterious Woman with Amnesia.

385
00:24:57.783 --> 00:25:00.148
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:25:00.148 --> 00:25:00.156
Next Conan's Hint:
Brooch.

387
00:25:00.156 --> 00:25:02.147
Brooch.
