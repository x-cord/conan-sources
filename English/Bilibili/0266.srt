1
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:03,424
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:05,324
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:06,924
Valentine's Day is coming up soon!

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,924
Would you like a case with chocolates?

5
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:10,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:12,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,824
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,937
Everyone has more or less gotten over the festive New Year holiday.

9
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:07,037
The girls send bitter and sweet chocolates to express

10
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:09,337
their feelings of superficiality or true love love to boys and men.

11
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,837
A gift-giving season in the middle of winter.

12
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,037
That is...

13
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,437
"Valentine's Day"

14
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:22,437
"Bloody Valentine (The Case)"

15
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,537
Valentine's my foot. Nonsense.

16
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:30,937
Everybody's just fallen for the tactics of the candy industry.

17
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:34,137
But I think people on the receiving end are very happy!

18
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,437
Besides, chocolate is good!

19
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:40,837
I bet you're all sulky because you're not going to get any.

20
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,037
Yes, you're so right!

21
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,537
With a body like this,

22
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:47,137
all I'll be getting are those for kids type chocolate anyway.

23
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,937
Well, he's right.

24
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,037
Japan's the only country where people are lightheartedly

25
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,937
getting all carried away over chocolate candies.

26
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,937
No one seems to be aware that Valentine's Day was named

27
00:02:56,937 --> 00:03:02,237
in memory of St. Valentine who was killed after being tortured.

28
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:04,537
Is that true?

29
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,637
But my mother told me

30
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:09,737
that Valentine's Day is a day when girls create precious memories

31
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:13,237
after getting the power of love from the chocolates.

32
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:16,537
She explained that is why chocolates are bitter and sweet.

33
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:19,637
Then, did you buy chocolate, Ayumi?

34
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,637
No.

35
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,837
Father said it was still too early for me to do something like that.

36
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,837
Well, I guess it's too early for you to be talking about love.

37
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,837
And?

38
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,737
What did the detective agency girl say she'd do?

39
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,937
Oh, you mean Ran?

40
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:38,337
She said that we'd be going to a mountain lodge called Suito,

41
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:41,237
but she didn't mention anything about chocolate.

42
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,237
I see.

43
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,437
Well, I sure hope

44
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,437
it doesn't turn out to be a bitter memory like Bloody Valentine.

45
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,437
Hey, hey.

46
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,837
Bloody Valentine?

47
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:54,037
It's where Al Capone made the seven members of the Muran family

48
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,437
that he antagonize stand in front of the garage

49
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,637
and shot them to death

50
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,837
on February 14th, 1929.

51
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:04,837
Capone?

52
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:09,237
Come to think of it,

53
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:12,237
he said he was raised in the town where Capone was.

54
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,537
Conan, hurry or we'll leave you behind!

55
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,737
Oh, okay!

56
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:18,937
What were you doing?

57
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:21,737
-Sorry! -Hey, Haibara...

58
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:28,837
Good grief. Why do we have to go to a lodge

59
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:33,037
way out in the remote mountains to make candy?

60
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:36,037
We're training ourselves to become good wives!

61
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,537
You can do all you like of things Iike that at home.

62
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,537
Well, don't worry.

63
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:45,337
I heard nothing about making candy, though.

64
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:48,937
I was told that I'd get to see a lot of cute mountain animals.

65
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,737
Oh, you mean you don't know?

66
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,737
Suito Mountain Lodge is famous for being able to make chocolate

67
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:56,637
that will make your love come true!

68
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,337
What?

69
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,937
Which means that you're going to hand make the chocolate,

70
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,637
and give it to Kyogyoku,

71
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,537
then finally confess your feelings to him?

72
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:07,137
Yes, that's what I plan on doing.

73
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,537
What's the matter, Sonoko?

74
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:16,737
Makoto hasn't called me lately.

75
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:20,337
Even if I call him, his phone is always set at voice message.

76
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,537
No...

77
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:25,437
I guess I goofed.

78
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,037
I told him over the phone that I'm making chocolate

79
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:29,837
for somebody I really like.

80
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,737
I went all out with this "I love you a whole lot" strategy

81
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:35,637
I'm sure that's it.

82
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:39,637
I should've told him straight that the chocolate was for him.

83
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:41,537
Everything will be just fine!

84
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:44,537
If you send him the chocolate I'm sure that Kyogyoku...

85
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,837
You're so strong, Ran.

86
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,037
Huh?

87
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:53,837
Just one week of not talking to him makes me this sad.

88
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,037
But as for you and Shinichi,

89
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:56,737
this kind of thing has been going on all this time, right?

90
00:05:56,737 --> 00:05:59,737
Well, I've gotten used to it.

91
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:05,337
And besides, who cares about whether he's around or not?

92
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,837
Hello, we've come to make chocolate!

93
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:17,537
How do you do?

94
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:20,437
Oh, so you're the old lady!

95
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:22,537
The owner of the lodge who is deceiving young women

96
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,737
ripping them off making candy

97
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:29,737
in a remote mountain lodge like this!

98
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,637
Hey, dad! Cut it out!

99
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:34,137
I'm so sorry.

100
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,737
"Chiyoko Yuasa (61)" -Deceive?

101
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,437
It's just that the press may such a big fuss over a couple

102
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:42,237
that coincidentally happened to get married

103
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:44,337
after making chocolate over here about 10 years ago,

104
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,137
and that reputation stands to this day!

105
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:50,437
My husband who was the previous owner passed away four years ago,

106
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:53,637
and thanks to a succession of spook scandals

107
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:57,837
the number of guests decreased drastically.

108
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:00,037
A spook scandal?

109
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:03,037
Well, I advise you all not to go outside alone

110
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:05,337
because a snowstorm is coming.

111
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:08,037
That is, if you don't want the spook that lives here

112
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:12,737
to give you a strange gift.

113
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:14,737
A strange gift?

114
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:17,237
Chocolate.

115
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:21,237
This mountain is pretty intricate,

116
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:23,737
and there are many people who get into trouble here.

117
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:26,437
The weird thing is, every year during this season,

118
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:29,637
chocolate is left

119
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:32,337
near the corpse that is found.

120
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,937
"Yoshitaka Nigaki (28)" -The local people say that

121
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:39,037
it could be the curse of a girl who was heading for this lodge

122
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:40,237
in order to make chocolate,

123
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,637
but died on the way after getting lost.

124
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,137
Or that it could be the snow woman.

125
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,537
There are various rumors going around.

126
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,537
Snow woman?

127
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,037
But there's nothing to worry about.

128
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,137
The police say that it's just that the chocolate

129
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,537
that is inside the belongings of the ones

130
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:58,737
who get into accidents in these mountains are scattered about

131
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:03,037
because of the hungry animals looking for food.

132
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:08,337
All right. I'll be going off to work, then.

133
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,337
Bye!

134
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:11,637
Mr. Nigaki.

135
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,537
I'm not against you pursuing it enthusiastically.

136
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,237
"Mika Konakawa (26)" -But don't let the show woman get to you

137
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:20,437
because of your enthusiasm and get yourself lost in the woods.

138
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,637
I'll be just fine!

139
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:28,337
If the snow woman offers me chocolate, I'll tell her

140
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:32,037
that I've got a girlfriend called Ako already.

141
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,337
"Ako Amari (25)"

142
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,437
Stop it, Yoshitaka.

143
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,937
See you, then.

144
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,737
Excuse me.

145
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,037
What is it, sonny?

146
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:47,537
He said he was going to work, but what does he do?

147
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,237
He's a journalist.

148
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,237
He went out to get films and pictures

149
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:56,637
that would serve as evidence of a case

150
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,337
he has been pursuing from five years ago.

151
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:03,937
I'm a photographer.

152
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,937
So in the beginning, I used to accompany him too.

153
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:09,837
Because he insisted he saw it in the forest.

154
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:12,137
He saw "it"? Don't tell me that

155
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,337
it was the snow woman?

156
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,737
No!

157
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:19,337
He's pursuing an animal that actually existed.

158
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,637
Well, I guess it's not much different from the snow woman

159
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:24,337
in terms that it is pretty much a phantom, too.

160
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:26,037
A phantom?

161
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:28,737
That's right.

162
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:32,037
Ever since it was caught and killed in 1905,

163
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,537
"Yuzo Sakami (42)" -the phantom mammal that hasn't be seen

164
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:34,637
for over a hundred years

165
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:39,037
and was written extinct on the red list.

166
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,137
The Japanese wolf!

167
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:44,937
A wolf?

168
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,937
Is it okay, though?

169
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,937
To go after such a valued animal

170
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,437
with a hunter's rifle like that.

171
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,537
Oh, you mean this rifle?

172
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:55,337
This rifle is used to threaten the wolf

173
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:58,837
and corner it into the trap.

174
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,137
Granny.

175
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:03,437
Take care of my friend that will be coming here soon, will you?

176
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:12,537
Talk about everybody getting infatuated over wolves!

177
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,237
Okay then, I guess I'll be on my way too.

178
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,037
When that guy's friend comes,

179
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:20,537
show them to their rooms, will you?

180
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:26,037
You mean you're leaving, too?

181
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:29,837
I'm going to visit my husband's grave that is in the woods.

182
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,737
Are you going to be okay going there all alone?

183
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:36,237
These mountains are like my backyard.

184
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:39,237
Besides, Saburo will go with me, too.

185
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,637
Saburo?

186
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,437
Oh, good boy!

187
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,837
Oh, it's a dog.

188
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,237
Don't tell me that the journalist who just went out

189
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:57,937
mistook that unleashed dog for a wolf?

190
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,437
No way.

191
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:03,237
It was 10pm when he saw the wolf.

192
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,437
Then, the more so...

193
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:09,237
Saburo is put in his cage after it gets dark.

194
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,337
Oh, I see.

195
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,637
Okay, so shall we start making chocolate

196
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:17,437
while granny's out?

197
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:18,637
-Okay. -Yes!

198
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,737
Huh? That granny are not the one who's going to teach?

199
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:25,537
She did before, though.

200
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:28,837
We're the ones who teach the guests now.

201
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:30,937
It's our way of thanking her for putting us up here

202
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,637
every time at this time of year.

203
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:35,737
But granny does do the finishing touches

204
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,937
on the chocolate, though.

205
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,337
I see.

206
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,937
I guess that thing about love what-nuts is something

207
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,437
that you can't really look forward to then.

208
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,537
Oh, shut up!

209
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,437
Okay, only three more days to Valentine's Day!

210
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:52,637
Let's give it our best shot!

211
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:03,337
Granny's husband died in an avalanche?

212
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,537
Yes.

213
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,537
Four years ago, on February the 14th.

214
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:11,137
It seems that he was buried under the snow for a week

215
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,437
until Saburo dug him out.

216
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:18,237
The other one was never dug out after all.

217
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,537
Huh? Another one?

218
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,437
My brother.

219
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,937
His whereabouts have been unknown ever since.

220
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:33,237
The police say that he's probably buried under the snow.

221
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:36,837
But I can't help feeling that he's still alive.

222
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:39,937
That's why I come here every year.

223
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:43,937
And besides, I visit the previous owner's grave, too!

224
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,437
I'm sorry for talking about something so glum.

225
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:49,937
Oh, no. Not at all

226
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,937
Is there anything can we help with?

227
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:56,337
No, no! Guys should stay out of the kitchen!

228
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:58,537
You'll get hurt like Mr. Nigaki did!

229
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,437
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,837
There.

231
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:05,537
Okay!

232
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:08,137
All right, I'm almost done!

233
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:11,037
Oh, how lovely!

234
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,737
Pretty good, pretty good!

235
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,237
That's true.

236
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:26,437
So why don't we all take a picture together with the chocolate?

237
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,837
-Okay! -Okay!

238
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:37,437
The blizzard is getting stronger.

239
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,937
I wonder if Mr. Nigaki is okay.

240
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:44,637
Sorry, but we'll go check on Mr. Nigaki.

241
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:45,737
So, wait here okay?

242
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,037
Okay.

243
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,837
Huh? Where are you going?

244
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,437
We'll be right back!

245
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:58,937
Mr. Nigaki, where are you?

246
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,037
Mr. Nigaki!

247
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:14,537
What?

248
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,837
Mr. Nigaki is nowhere in sight?

249
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:22,137
Yes. We split up to search for him, but...

250
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:24,737
The blizzard's getting worse!

251
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,937
Anyway, let's go search for him before the visibility becomes zero.

252
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,837
Conan, wait here in the lodge.

253
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,037
All right!

254
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:38,137
Like I'd do that.

255
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,537
Let's go, Saburo!

256
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:05,987
Yoshitaka!

257
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:09,287
-Mr. Nigaki! -Mr. Nigaki!

258
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,787
Where are you?

259
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:12,987
Mr. Nigaki!

260
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,387
Where are you, Mr. Nigaki?

261
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:18,187
Hey! Answer us!

262
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:19,687
Where are you?

263
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,587
Mr. Nigaki!

264
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,487
The sound of a rifle?

265
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,987
Looks bad.

266
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,987
Maybe he got to it first?

267
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,187
Who are you?

268
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,487
Me?

269
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:40,087
I'm a guest staying at Suito Moutain Lodge.

270
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:41,587
"Hajime Itakura (37)"

271
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:49,287
Darn it. Where the hell are you, Mr. Nigaki?

272
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,487
Hey, Saburo!

273
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,487
Mr. Nigaki?

274
00:15:58,487 --> 00:15:59,887
Mr. Nigaki!

275
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:07,887
No good, he's not breathing.

276
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,387
He was beaten to death.

277
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,787
What's this?

278
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,987
A chocolate?

279
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:23,887
Yoshitaka, please answer me!

280
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:27,387
This is impossible. The blizzard's getting worst!

281
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,387
Hey, what are you going to do?

282
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:32,487
If we keep on searching the mountain like this,

283
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,987
we'll end up dead ourselves.

284
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:38,887
But we can't just leave Mr. Nigaki.

285
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:39,887
Huh?

286
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:40,887
A dog?

287
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,687
In a remote mountain like this?

288
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,587
Could it be Saburo?

289
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,987
It can't be! Because he should be back at the lodge!

290
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:51,087
Don't tell me it's Conan?

291
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,487
Conan?

292
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:01,187
Just what are you doing here?

293
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,687
I told you to stay at the lodge, didn't I?

294
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,287
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:08,787
But Ms. Mika said a while ago that

296
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:12,487
when the previous owner of the lodge got caught in an avalanche,

297
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:16,087
Saburo dug him out.

298
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,987
Huh? Well, yes.

299
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,487
That's why I thought that

300
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:25,287
maybe Saburo would be able to find Mr. Nigaki, too.

301
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,987
Since Mr. Nigaki had come to the lodge many times,

302
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:31,687
I was sure that Saburo would be familiar with his smell, too.

303
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:35,087
And? Did you find Mr. Nigaki?

304
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,287
Yes, we've found him.

305
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,587
But he's already cold...

306
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:42,287
What?

307
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,387
No, no way.

308
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,587
This isn't happening is it, Yoshitaka?

309
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,387
-Yoshitaka! -Stay away!

310
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:56,487
Look! His face are smeared with blood.

311
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:59,087
And there's a blood covered branch

312
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,687
that is on the ground right beside him.

313
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:04,787
This is undoubtedly a homicide case.

314
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:07,187
Now that we know it's a murder,

315
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,087
we can't mess this site up anymore.

316
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,287
Murder?

317
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,587
No way.

318
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:15,387
Hey, what's with that big shot attitude of yours?

319
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,087
You're not a police detective or something, are you?

320
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:21,087
You're right about I'm not a police detective anymore,

321
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:24,387
but I am an ex-officer and now detective, Kogoro Mouri!

322
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,887
What?

323
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,587
Mouri? Don't tell me that you're...

324
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:29,787
That renowned detective?

325
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:33,387
Then, do you know who the killer is?

326
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:36,887
No. Because his body is frozen from this cold

327
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:39,787
making it impossible to figure out the estimated time of death.

328
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:43,387
Moreover, the wind has blown away the footprints.

329
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:45,587
The only thing that may be left as a clue

330
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:50,087
is that Mr. Nigaki's blood may have stained the killer's clothes.

331
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:55,187
I'm pretty sure he was killed during the day time.

332
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,487
The reason why the blood on Mr. Nigaki's face

333
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,387
is wiped off part way

334
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,187
is that it had been wiped off when something rubbed against it.

335
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:06,187
And the fact that he is still wearing his goggles shows that

336
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,887
he was killed when it was still bright,

337
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:10,487
and the blizzard hadn't come yet.

338
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:12,687
It would be too dangerous

339
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:16,287
to move along in this blizzard with these goggles on.

340
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,587
I see Just as would be expected of a renown detective.

341
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,687
It's not a big deal.

342
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,887
This is a mere first step in any investigation.

343
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,087
I wonder about that.

344
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:28,587
Not you again.

345
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:32,387
Take a good look inside his goggles.

346
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:36,287
His left contact lens is out of place!

347
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,887
You idiot!

348
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,187
That's probably because he killer punched him...

349
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:43,587
But he's not wearing contact lens in his right eye

350
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:46,287
nor is it inside his goggles.

351
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:48,187
True.

352
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,787
Oh, I get it!

353
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:53,087
The right one probably fell to the ground when he was punched,

354
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:54,987
and at the same time, his goggles moved out of place,

355
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,287
so the killer fixed it for him!

356
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:58,987
I see.

357
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:01,787
What a meticulous killer.

358
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,987
Hey, this is no time to be convinced.

359
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:07,687
Could it be that the killer deliberately made him wear it?

360
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,187
That's right.

361
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:13,787
But why do something like that?

362
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:16,887
Come to think of it, I found something strange.

363
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,387
It's this chocolate!

364
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:22,287
I found it on his stomach.

365
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:26,387
Yoshi is written on it.

366
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:30,787
the chocolate you made today, Ako?

367
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,587
Why?

368
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:35,487
Why is my chocolate over here?

369
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:38,787
Aren't you the one who put it near the corpse?

370
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,587
Ako couldn't have done it!

371
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:44,787
The chocolate was in the kitchen until we all left the lodge.

372
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:49,587
She was with us right through after that.

373
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:52,687
Then, who put the chocolate over here?

374
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:55,187
It's probably the killer.

375
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,587
And it seems that the corpse has been touched everywhere, too.

376
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:01,387
It's pretty likely that the killer brought it here

377
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:04,287
to make it look like Ako committed the crime.

378
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:06,787
At any rate, let's talk this over after returning to the lodge

379
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,487
and contacting the police.

380
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:12,087
The police are not going to be able to get here for a while.

381
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,587
Hey, Mr. Sakami.

382
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,087
I'm surprised that you found this place.

383
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:18,687
I heard the dog barking.

384
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,087
Never mind that.

385
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:23,087
Just what do you mean by the police can't come here?

386
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,087
The tunnel located part way along the road

387
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:28,087
that leads from the foot of the mountain to the lodge

388
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,387
has been blocked off by an avalanche

389
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:32,487
that occurred about 30 minutes ago.

390
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:34,387
I'm pretty sure it's going to take at least a day

391
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,387
before they can open up the road again.

392
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:38,587
-Oh, no! -Seriously?

393
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,387
Then, what is it?

394
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:41,387
Are you saying that we're going to have to spend the night

395
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:44,087
at the lodge tonight?

396
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:49,487
When the one who killed Mr. Nigaki may be among us?

397
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:53,487
I don't have problem with that.

398
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:56,587
That's more thrilling.

399
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,587
If you don't want to spend the night over at the lodge,

400
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,687
why don't you spend the entire night

401
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:04,387
beside your big brother who was killed?

402
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,687
But by day break,

403
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:09,287
you may have turned into snow woman, though.

404
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:19,187
Blood stains that have been wiped off.

405
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:22,987
Goggles that were replaced on him.

406
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:26,387
And Ms. Ako's chocolate.

407
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,487
Why did the killer go out of the way

408
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:32,787
to bring Ako's chocolate out of the kitchen?

409
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,887
Why?

410
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,487
"Next Episode" -It's a picture that was taken...

411
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,087
when he was punched!

412
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:12,987
Huh? How can you tell?

413
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:15,687
Come to think of it, before I met all of you here,

414
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,387
I ran into a queer guy in the woods.

415
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:23,387
A huge guy wearing a black knitted cap!

416
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:26,087
A man wearing a black knitted cap?

417
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:28,187
It can't be...

418
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:29,287
Don't tell me that...

419
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:31,387
Next Conan,

420
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:35,308
"Bloody Valentine (The Deduction)"

421
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:38,605
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:40,205
"Playing ball"
