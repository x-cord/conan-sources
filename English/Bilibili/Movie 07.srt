00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,160
Detective Conan
Crossroad in the Ancient Capital

2
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
I'm a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

3
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,310
When I went to the amusement park

4
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,810
with my childhood friend Ran Mouri,

5
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,610
I witnessed a suspicious transaction of a man in black.

6
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,910
As I was focused on the ongoing transaction,

7
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,010
I didn't notice the other man in black,
who was the accomplice, behind my back,

8
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,610
and I was poisoned by that man.

9
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,210
When I woke up...

10
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,810
my body shrank.

11
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,410
If those guys knew that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

12
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,710
it'll endanger the safety of my relatives and friends.

13
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,110
Following the advice of Professor Agasa, I hid my true identity.

14
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,010
When Ran asked for my name,

15
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,310
I came up with
Conan Edogawa at an instant.

16
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,410
To get more information about those men in black,

17
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,310
I stayed at Ran's house, whose father is a detective.

18
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,510
I'm a high school detective in Osaka, Heiji Hattori.

19
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,110
I inherited my detective and Kendo skills

20
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,010
from my father, who was the head
of the Osaka Prefecture Police Department,

21
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,810
and I inherited self-possession from my mother.

22
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,510
By the way, I got my dark skin from grandpa.

23
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,910
We were once known as the Kudo of Kanto, and Hattori of Kansai.

24
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,110
Though I'm on par with Kudo,

25
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,210
Kudo is truly quite something.

26
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,610
He used the unique tools invented by Professor Agasa

27
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,110
and solved many cases one after another.

28
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,310
Other than the Professor and myself,

29
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,410
those who know about the true identity of Kudo,

30
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,810
include the parents of Kudo

31
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,410
as well as Ai Haibara, the girl who goes
to the same elementary school as Kudo.

32
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,010
This little girl used to be a member of the Black Organization

33
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,010
While fleeing the organization,

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,310
she took the same poison as Kudo

35
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,610
and her body also shrank.

36
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,310
Speaking of that, I also have a childhood friend
who's also my classmate,

37
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,710
Kazuha Toyama.

38
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,010
A very long-winded woman.

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,310
Who's this long-winded person?

40
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,810
Hey, don't just jump out of nowhere, idiot.

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,910
You're an idiot. Who are you talking to?

42
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,110
What do you mean who?

43
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,710
I'm explaining to the audience in simple language,

44
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,810
right?

45
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,110
Do you have a problem?

46
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,410
You're the one with a problem.

47
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,710
Even though I've shrunk down, my brain still works as it should.

48
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,010
Only one truth will prevail!

49
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,610
We've arrived at Beika Station, the exit...

50
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,910
So that means you still can't come back yet?

51
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,310
Yeah, I'm busy investigating the case.

52
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,410
I see.

53
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,310
It's quite cold these days. Stay warm.

54
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,110
Don't sleep with your belly exposed.

55
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,410
I don't have my belly exposed, idiot.

56
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,010
The snow on Mount Yoshino, my longings,

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,310
The one who left me, when will I see you again?

58
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,910
You guys are not Yoshitsune and Shizuka Gozen.

59
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,810
What?

60
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,410
I'm worried if there's anything wrong with my childhood friend.

61
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,110
Dad is being long-winded. I'm hanging up.

62
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,710
Hello? Hello?

63
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,910
I should call next time when Uncle is not around.

64
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,310
Yoshitsune and Shizuka Gozen,

65
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,010
didn't these two stop seeing each other after they separated?

66
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,510
Hey...hey.

Benkei is so slow.

72
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,910
He said he solved the riddle already.

73
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,910
This is what the guy's interested in the most.

74
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,810
Kataoka.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,410

(A Few Days Later

82
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,610
According to the results of the investigation,

the 5 victims killed in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto

84
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,310
were all members of Genjibotaru, the gang of robbers.

85
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,340
Therefore, this case...

86
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,760
(Kyoto Prefecture Police Department Inspector, Fumimaro Ayanokoji)
Sato,

87
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,310
I heard that Inspector Fumimaro Ayanokouji from the Kyoto Prefecture Police Department

88
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,810
joined the police force at the same time as the Shiratori.

89
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,410
Yes, I heard that he's from a royal family
and everyone calls him the “Royal Inspector".

90
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,010
Look at his left pocket.

91
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,010
Wh-What's that?

92
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,010
His pet chipmunk.

93
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,110
I heard that he carries it everywhere.

94
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,910
He's weirder than Shiratori, right?

95
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,110
Genjibotaru, since the third year of Heisei (1991),

96
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,810
have been active mostly in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka

97
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,610
and mainly been stealing Buddhist statues and artworks.

98
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,110
They have a special feature,

99
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,810
as their members would call each other
by the names of Yoshitsune's subordinates,

100
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,910
and every member possesses a copy of "Chronicles of Yoshitsune"

101
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,610
("Chronicles of Yoshitsune")
They all have a copy of "Chronicles of Yoshitsune"

("Chronicles of Yoshitsune")

103
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,710
The leader is Yoshitsune.

104

The following eight people includes Benkei and Iseno Saburo.

105
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,410
This time, except for these three,
the other five have all been killed.

106
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,510
Their Yoshitsune books have also been taken away.

107
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,410
How about clues on the murderer?

108
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,200

I can be certain that he's a master of Kendo and archery

109
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,930
(Osaka Prefecture Officer Otaki)
As for Yoshitsune, Benkei and Iseno Saburo,

110
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,510
As for Yoshitsune, Benkei and Iseno Saburo,

111
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,910
we don't know their ages or genders yet.

112
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,410
No matter what,

113
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,010
we need to bring the murderer

114
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,110
and other members of the gang to justice as soon as possible.

115
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,010
The search will continue.

116
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,410
Yoshitsune from the Heisei era

117
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,110
turned out to be a leader of a gang of robbers.

118
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,910
Hattori, are you there?

119
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,310
Come on, isn't this a very important thing?

120
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,410
Yes, indeed, it's got to be stored well.

121
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,610
Hattori, are you going out?

122
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,610
Yes, I've got something I want to investigate.

123
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,310
Is there a problem?

124
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,810
I wanted to go see the cherry blossoms with you at the Ryokuchi Park.

125
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,210
But it's okay.

126
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,910
Really? Then I'll be heading out.

127
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,710
Be careful.

128
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,510
Okay.

129
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,310
Why do I have to put on a smile and send him out of the door?

130
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,310
Kyoto is truly the hometown for us Japanese.

131
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,710
Listen up, I invited you guys to come along out of good will,

132
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,410
don't interfere with my work.

133
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,510
Roger that.

134
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,010
So jealous that Conan gets to go to Kyoto.

135
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,710
It seems that Mouri received a call
from a temple called Sannou Temple.

136
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,310
We want to go to Kyoto as well.

137
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,010
I can take you guys there.

138
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,110
Really?

139
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,110
Then I'll get to see Conan.

140
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,000
Kyoto, Kyoto, let's go to Kyoto tomorrow.

141
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,400
-Kyoto, Kyoto, let's go to Kyoto tomorrow.
-But you have to solve the riddle before you can go.

142
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,810
Here we go again.

143
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,210
You don't really want to take us there, do you?

144
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,510
What does it matter?

145
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,310
Tell us about it.

146
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,110
We can pass the time.

147
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,910
What do we do?

148
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,510
Let's give it a try.

149
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,210
That's true.

150
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,810
The three of you know who Benkei is, right?

151
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,710
He's Yoshitsune's subordinate, right?

152
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,510
Who is Yoshitsune?

153
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,410
Nicknamed Ushiwakamaru,

154
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,310
he defeated Benki,

155
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,510
who wanted to take his 1000th sword, on the Gojou Bridge in Kyoto.

156
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,410
He took Benki in as his subordinate
and he renamed himself as Youshitsune.

157
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,910
Genji and Heiki were fighting at the time,

158
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,310
and although Yoshitsune defeated Heiki,

159
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,810
he was despised by his brother, Yoritomo.

160
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,510
Finally, in what we know as Iwate Prefecture today,

161
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,310
Yoshitsune committed suicide.

162
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,710
You know it so well.

163
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,410
There is your question here,

164
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,610
Benki had a first love, named Uzune.

165
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,910
But this girl was going to marry another man,

166
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,910
and after Benki got the news, he

167
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,010
1. got angry.

168
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,710
2. was happy

169
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,110
3. cried.

170
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,210
So which is the right answer?

171
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,810
Well, it's a first love,

172
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,210
of course he got angry,

173
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,510
How could he be happy?

174
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,910
So you choose the first answer. That he got angry.

175
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,010
Cried.

176
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,810
The answer is that he cried.

177
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,010
You came up with this from "Benkei's sore spot", right?

178
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,610
I really can't win over Ai.

179
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,110
What is "Benkei's sore spot"?

180
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,610
In other words, even for someone who is as strong as Benki,

181
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,410
there'll be a weak spot that would make him cry
if he gets hit at that spot.

182
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,510
It's here. The mukouzune (the spot below the knee),
that's "Benkei's sore spot."

183
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,610
But does this have anything to do with the riddle?

184
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,810
Well…

185
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,010
I got it!

186
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,520
The couple getting married are Mukou and Uzune.

187
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
(When combined, it's mukouzune, the spot below the knee.)
When Mukou marries Uzune, you get "mukouzune".

188
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,710
Another lame joke.

189
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,310
But the answer's correct.

190
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,910
We can go to Kyoto now.

191
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,210
But Ai was the one who answered it correctly.

192
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,210
Haibara is also a member of us Detective Boys.

193
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,810
Please don't exclude Huihara from us.

194
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,410
Mom said that an adult who goes back on his words is the worst.

195
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,210
Thank you for visiting.

196
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,010
No need.

197
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,830
(Sannou Temple)

198
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,460
Don't tell others what I told you guys last time.

199
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,310
(Ryuen 34, Monk of Sannou Temple)

200
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,010
Mr. Mouri.

201
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,810
Welcome.

202
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,110
I'm Ryuen, the person who called you.

203
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,610
Let me make the introductions.

204
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,520
(Enkai, 65, the Chief priest of Sannou Temple)
This is the Chief priest, Enkai.

205
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,810
The three here are the benefactors of this temple.

206
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
(Shozo Sakura, 51, antique art dealer)
This is Mr. Shozo Sakura.

207
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,840
(Shozo Sakura, 51, antique art dealer)
He runs an antique shop on Teramachi Street.

208
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,210
Are you the famous Kogoro Mouri?

209
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,910
Really? Am I that famous?

210
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,310
(Mizuo Harutaro, 33, Noh actor)
This is the young heir to the Noh performance,

211
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,910
(Mizuo Harutaro, 33, Noh actor)
Mr. Shuntaro Mizuo.

212
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,710
(Taiga Saijo, 35, old bookstore owner)
Then there is Mr. Taiga Saijo, who owns an ancient bookstore.

213
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,360
(Taiga Saijo, 35, old bookstore owner)
Nice to meet you.

214
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,610
It's better to say that we're kendo friends rather than benefactors.

215
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,910
Everyone practices kendo?

216
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,110
No wonder the Chief Priest looks very energetic.

217
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,210
Kendo friends?

218
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,210
I heard that there is a secret treasure in the temple
that is only exhibited to the public once every twelve years.

219
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,410
Yes, it is the Healing Buddha statue.

220
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,210
The next occasion is just three days away, right?

221
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,310
We also wanted to see it, so we came here specially for it.

222
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,010
In this case, the Healing Buddha will be very happy as well.

223
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,010
What? The Buddha statue was stolen?

224
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,910
Yes, that was already eight years ago.

225
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,280
(Sunlight Bodhisattva)
The one on the right is Sunlight Bodhisattva.

226
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,110
(Moonlight Bodhisattva)
The one on the left is Moonlight Bodhisattva.

227
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,310
But the Buddha statue in the middle is gone.

228
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,110
I wanted to call the police right away,

229
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,810
but was stopped by the Chief Priest.

230
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,910
He said it might come back if it was meant to be.

231
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,810
You're very optimistic about this.

232
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,810
Then eight years has passed.

233
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,610
Just five days ago,

234
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,610
I found this letter in the mailbox of the temple.

235
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,610
There's no stamp nor name of the sender.

236
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,710
Solve this riddle and you will find
the whereabouts of the Buddha statue.

237
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,410
What kind of painting is this?

238
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,810
Thanks, uncle.

239
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,510
Sure enough, there were no witnesses to the case
that happened in the early hours of the morning.

240
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,810
Robber!

241
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,010
Get out of my way!

242
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,610
Ouch! You're going to pay for this!

243
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,410
Got hit on the mukouzune, it hurts.

244
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,510
Here you go. Is this yours, Madam?

245
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,110
Thank you. You were awesome just now.

246
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,910
Don't mention it. It's alright.

247
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,520
(Tae Yamakura, 52, Miyagawa teahouse owner)
My family owns a teahouse in Miyagawa.

248
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,810
(Tae Yamakura, 52, Miyagawa teahouse owner)
My name is Tae Yamakura.

249
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,700
Come on, introduce yourself, too.

250
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,880
(Suzu Chika, 19, Geisha)
Okay.

251
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,920
(Suzu Chika, 19, Geisha)
My name is Suzu Chika, nice to meet you.

252
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,410
How can I thank you?

253
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,010
No need, it's not a big deal.

254
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,110
Come hang out at the store next time.

255
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,610
Be safe on the way back.

256
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,010
Thanks.

257
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,410
What does this painting mean?

258
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,710
On the fifth row on top,

259
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,410
there's a cicada, a tengu, and a goldfish.

260
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,810
On the fourth row, there's a chicken and a loach.

261
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,010
The yellow loach is really disgusting.

262
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,510
What is this dot?

263
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,810
Is it dirt?

264
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,910
In the middle of the second and third row,

265
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,610
there's a violet, tengu, and Mount Fuji.

266
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,010
There's also an acorn next to it.

267
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,810
Dad, can you find it before the day after tomorrow?

268
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,710
Don't worry.

269
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,510
This kind of painting doesn't even constitute a riddle for me.

270
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,810
Hey, seriously?

271
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,110
I'll leave it to the experts to find the Buddha statue.

272
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,610
Let's go and visit Kyoto.

273
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,410
That's it.

274
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,810
You will only disturb me here.

275
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,210
Actually, I've already gotten in touch with Toyama,

276
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,710
and I asked her to be our Kyoto tour guide tomorrow.

277
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,410
But Hattori seems to have something going on and he can't come.

278
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,610
It doesn't matter if the boys
who already have girlfriends come or not.

279
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,610
That guy is not coming?

280
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,410
Conan, let's go together.

281
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,410
I won't be going.

282
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,010
I have a date with a kid nearby to go fishing by the river.

283
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,610
You've made friends so soon.

284
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,110
Be careful.

285
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,810
First of all, it seems that the Buddha statue
was stolen from Sannou Temple.

286
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,110
It must be Genjibotaru.

287
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,110
But who on earth sent this painting, and for what purpose?

288
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,710
And what does it have to do with the five murder cases?

289
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,310
Genjibotaru...

290
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,110
Talking about Yoshitsune and Benkei,

291
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,210
it should still be there.

292
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,250
(Gojou Bridge)

293
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,110
Nothing seems to be related to the riddle in the painting.

294
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,310
On the Gojou Bridge in Kyoto,

295
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,210
the strongman Benkei wields a long sword

296
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,410
and initiates an attack toward Ushiwakamaru.

297
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,210
Hattori…

298
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,110
I can't believe that I'd meet you here.

299
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,010
Hey, give me the bamboo knife.

300
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,210
Sorry. Thank you.

301
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,510
Hey, let's go.

302
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,610
Work hard on your practice.

303
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,110
Why did you borrow a bamboo knife?

304
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,510
What are you doing in this kind of place?

305
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,910
And what are you doing here?

306
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,410
Actually I know the owner of the Takoyaki shop
who was killed in Osaka.

307
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,210
Although he was a member of a robber's gang,

308
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,210
I used to go to that store since I was in junior high school

309
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,210
and he took good care of me, so

310
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,310
I wanted to find the murderer for him.

311
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,410
That's why you came to Kyoto looking for clues.

312
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,710
In this case, I have something to show you.

313
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,310
I see.

314
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,010
If you solve the riddle in this painting,

315
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,610
you might not only find the Buddha statue,

316
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,110
but also the murderer.

317
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,210
So you...

318
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,810
Yes, if it is Genjibotaru who stole the Buddha statue,

319
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,810
then we might find clues to solving the riddle

320
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,510
in places related to Yoshitsune and Benkei.

321
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,210
But I am not familiar with Kyoto at all.

322
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,410
Then leave it to me.

323
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,310
I will show you the way.

324
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,310
(Gojyoten Shrine)

325
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,960
(Gojyoten Shrine)
This is Gojyoten Shrine.

326
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,410
"Chronicles of Yoshitsune" records
that the two weren't on the Gojyouoohashi bridge,

327
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,810
instead, they met here for the first time.

328
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,210
How is it? Is there anything in common?

329
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,710
Doesn't look like it.

330
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,510
Then let's head to the next place,

331
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,710
That's really upsetting.

332
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,910
Why didn't the monks at Sannou Temple come to me?

333
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,810
When it comes to detectives in Kansai, it should be me, right?

334
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,110
Maybe they didn't want the police to know,

335
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,610
since your dad is a senior police officer.

336
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,710
Forget it.

337
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,810
Wait, in that case…

338
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,610
Here it is. Right here.

339
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,140
(Benkei Stone)
Benkei Stone.

340
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,810
Some says that's the stone that Benkai often sat on,

341
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,810
while others say it is a stone thrown down from Mount Hie.

342
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,110
In short, there are many legends.

343
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,110
That doesn't seem to have anything to do with this either.

344
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,310
Really?

345
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,910
Let's check out the next one then.

346
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,310
Where's the next one?

347
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,610
Keage Slope.

348
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,110
I'm a Kyoto Prefecture police officer, Ayanokoji.

349
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,110
I know you are investigating Genjibotaru's case,

350
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,310
but this is not Osaka.

351
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,310
It's best for the laymen not to be nosy.

352
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,610
It's a chipmunk.

353
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,710
Watch out for yourself.

354
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,010
There are strange police officers like this everywhere.

355
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,250
(Kiyomizudera Temple)

356
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,810
Let's take some pictures.

357
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,910
Make sure you get the cherry blossoms, too.

358
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,110
So beautiful.

359
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,510
If I get to see such a beautiful view with Kyogoku,

360
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,710
it'll be such a blessing.

361
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,710
Ran, seriously.

362
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,010
It's my turn this time.

363
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,310
Toyama, did you have a fight with Hattori?

364
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,710
Actually Heiji also came to Kyoto to investigate a case,

365
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,910
and Heiji's first love is also in Kyoto.

366
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,570
(Keage Slope Canal Park)

367
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,890
(Perfected Great Sun Buddha)

368
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,710
This doesn't seem to be right either.

369
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,410
Let's go and grab lunch.

370
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,210
OK.

371
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,910
Cherry blossoms.

372
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,210
I always recall what happened 8 years ago

373
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,010
when I see cherry blossoms.

374
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,210
At that time, I went on an adventure in temples in Kyoto,

375
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,210
and I accidentally hit the lattice window of the temple.

376
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,310
Even the wooden frame was broken.

377
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,610
I hit my head hard on the floor

378
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,310
and passed out.

379
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,510
I was out for an unknown period of time.

380
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,710
When I woke up…

381
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,810
After Shichijo comes Hachi-Kujo

382
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,910
Kujo, toji comes at the end.

Setta-Chara, chara-Uonotana.

387
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,010
It felt like a dream.

388
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,610
But it was real.

389
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,310
I always think we'll meet again.

390
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,310
What are you laughing about?

391
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,510
Sorry, please continue.

392
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,810
I always bring this with me when I come to Kyoto.

393
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,010
Crystal bead.

394
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,910
I seem to have seen it somewhere.

395
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,010
Really?

396
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,210
There's someone with the same crystal?

397
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,010
No.

398
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,810
So does she know about it?

399
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,110
She?

400
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,510
You mean Toyama?

401
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,010
Although I never told her the details,

402
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,310
she seems to know.

403
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,410
She knew it because...

404
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,510
The interview in the magazine.

405
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,810
Yes, it is the most popular magazine in Kansai.

406
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,410
Heiji was asked who his first love was,

407
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,810
and he said she's someone he met in third grade of elementary school

408
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,610
who's slightly older than him.

409
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,210
He also said he got a precious token from the girl,

410
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,210
and went out of his way to pose for this photo.

411
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,210
What is this?

412
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,210
Just a crystal bead.

413
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,410
Maybe that girl dropped it.

414
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,210
So you know that girl?

415
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,610
How would I?

416
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,210
Heiji only met her once,

417
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,110
so every time I come to Kyoto, I will ask about her.

418
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,310
That's why he took the photos with the crystal bead.

419
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,610
He probably wanted that girl

420
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,610
to get in touch with him after reading the interview.

421
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,810
Right, what a damn thing.

422
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,310
He even posted a photo of himself as a kid.

423
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,910
So cute.

424
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,110
Right? Right? Heiji was super cute back then...

425
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,410
Ran, this is not the point,

426
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,910
but forget about it.

427
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,010
Even if Hattori has a first love,

428
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,910
that's already a thing of the past.

429
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,210
And you two look like you're in a stable relationship.

430
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,410
But first love is very special for men.

431
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,510
Sonoko.

432
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,410
Forget about it. Let's not talk about something so depressing.

433
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,210
By the way, have some red bean soup.

434
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,710
Boss, we want three bowls of red bean soup. Be quick please.

435
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,810
There is the west gate of Kurama Temple.

436
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,610
Although usually you should go in through the Nio Gate,

437
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,210
this is a shortcut.

438
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,250
(Kurama Temple  Inner Temple  588 meters)

439
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,410
(Immobile Hall of Sojyougatani)
This is the Immobile Hall of Sojyougatani.

440
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,110
Ushiwakamaru learned Kendo here from Tengu.

441
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,210
This is really a good place for practicing kendo.

442
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,710
This cedar tree is really big.

443
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,410
Hattori, it's not here either.

444
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,310
Get down.

445
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,910
Stop.

446
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,510
Kudo.

447
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,310
This guy is just like Ushiwakamaru.

448
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,510
Darn.

449
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,610
Kudo, catch it. Let's go!

450
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,610
Almost there!

451
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,010
That's harsh.

452
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,530
(Kurama Temple)

453
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,100
(Kurama Temple Station)

454
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,410
Passengers, please get in the train as soon as possible.

455
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,310
The train is about to depart.

456
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,210
Don't have to be in such a hurry.

457
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,210
This is a railway track.

458
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,310
Don't talk to me, or I'll be distracted.

459
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,610
Violation of the traffic law.

460
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,310
You'll definitely get your license revoked this time.

461
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,610
What is he going to do?

462
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,710
Damn it.

463
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,210
I literally almost caught up.

464
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,810
That guy should be the murderer

465
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,010
who killed Genjibotaru, right?

466
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,410
Probably.

467
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,310
But I don't know why he attacked you.

468
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,310
Hattori,

469
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,410
why are you here?

470
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,410
I ran into Kudo on the street.

471
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,410
I mean, this kid.

472
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,010
And we wanted to solve the riddle in the painting together.

473
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,010
So has the riddle in the painting been solved?

474
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,910
Not yet, it's hard.

475
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,910
By the way, did uncle solve it?

476
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,240

The Chief Priest told us about it.

492
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,810
Oh, it's the Chief Priest.

493
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,710
Then would you like to join us?

494
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,610
Sorry to interrupt.

495
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,010
Hey, aren't you from Miyagawa...

496
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,910
Yes, I'm Suzu Chika.

497
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,610
I owe you for that one time.

498
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,310
Do you know, Heiji?

499
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,210
Kind of.

500
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,310
You create trouble when no one notices, seriously.

501
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,810
Ran,

502
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,410
don't blame your father.

503
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,910
I invited him to come.

504
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,910
Yeah,

505
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,210
we wanted the renowned detective to help us

506
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,610
with investigating the Genjibotaru's case together.

507
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,780
(Sakura House's owner)
Speaking of the members of Genjibotaru,

508
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,120
it seems that everyone has a copy of "Chronicles of Yoshitsune".

509
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,910
I have one, too. It's a good book.

510
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,410
Right, bookstore boss?

511
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,610
Yes, but I don't like that book very much.

512
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,010
Although the name is "Chronicles of Yoshitsune",

513
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,010
it's all about Benkei's deeds.

514
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,910
It should be called "Benkeiji".

515
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,710
But I like it.

516
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,610
Especially Benkei's story in Ataka. That's the best.

517
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,610
What is Ataka?

518
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,010
It's a play of Noh theatre.

519
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,410
In order to escape Yorimoto's pursuit,

520
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,010
Yoshitsune and the family members disguised as monks

521
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,510
to pass the checkpoint at Anzaka.

522
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,310
Just when Yoshitsune's disguise was about to be seen through,

523
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,910
Benkei acted within a split second and beat Yoshitsune.

524
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,610
Why?

525
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,510
To deceive the guards at the checkpoint.

526
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,510
Because no one would have thought
that the subordinate would beat his master.

527
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,710
Then Yoshitsune and his party passed the checkpoint smoothly.

528
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,910
Afterwards, Benkei cried and apologized to Yoshitsune.

529
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,510
Unexpectedly, Yoshitsune praised Benkei for his wit.

530
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,110
From then on, the master and subordinate had a deep connection.

531
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,710
And the story went on as a legend.

532
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,610
I'm sorry. I've been having trouble sleeping lately.

533
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,210
I want to rest for a while in the room down there.

534
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,010
We don't have guests coming in tonight.

535
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,410
You can go to the room next door.

536
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,410
It's alright. The room down there will do.

537
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,210
Please wake me up at 9 o'clock.

538
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,310
Everyone, please have fun.

539
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,510
We can see the river.

540
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,110
It's Kamogawa.

541
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,310
The cherry blossoms are so beautiful.

542
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,610
Yeah.

543
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,010
Ran, come and have a look.

544
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,610
It's nice to view cherry blossom in pairs on the Kamogawa River,

545
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,110
but enjoying the cherry blossoms across the Misogi River
that surrounds this building

546
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,610
also feels quite special.

547
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,710
Yeah, really beautiful.

548
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,610
It is good indeed.

549
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,510
It's almost like a delicacy.

550
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,010
I really want to eat it.

551
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,310
Are you hurt?

552
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,010
Yeah, a little bit.

553
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,710
Let me help you.

554
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,410
That's too much.

555
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,510
Creepy old man.

556
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,810
Hey, look.

557
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,710
Inspector Ayanokoji.

558
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,110
What is he doing there?

559
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,910
You can go to the terrace below

560
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,710
to see the cherry blossoms at night.

561
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,110
After the clouds clear tonight,

562
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,010
the moon will show its beauty.

563
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,310
Let's go and check it out.

564
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,810
Great.

565
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,110
I'll stay here.

566
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,110
Me, too.

567
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,110
Why?

568
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,710
Do you care about that geisha?

569
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,310
Idiot, what nonsense are you talking about?

570
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,110
I lost.

571
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,910
Uncle is really going all out.

572
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,010
He has always been like this.

573
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,610
Suzu Chika, one more time.

574
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,210
Do it again.

575
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,310
I'd like to use the restroom.

576
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,310
It's okay. I'm not drunk yet.

577
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,110
Just stay with Mr. Mouri.

578
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,910
OK.

579
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,910
Okay, let's start.

580
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,610
The moon is out.

581
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,510
The moon.

582
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,710
What's wrong?

583
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,410
It reminds me of the date I had with Ran before.

584
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,210
That day, when I remembered I had a date,

585
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,510
I was already two hours late.

586
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,810
That's too crazy.

587
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,610
I thought she had left.

588
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,710
But I still went to our meet-up point to check.

589
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,210
Who is it?

590
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,010
I'm sorry, I totally...

591
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,410
It's great.

592
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,810
I was worried that

593
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,510
something might've happened to you.

594
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,210
Was that when you realized

595
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,310
that she's more than a childhood friend?

596
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,310
Idiot, there is no such thing.

597
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,410
I have long discovered that she's more than a childhood friend.

598
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,110
She's probably still waiting for me.

599
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,310
What's wrong, Ran?

600
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,910
Nothing.

601
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,810
Heiji is really irritating.

602
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,010
But Toyama, I'm so jealous of you.

603
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,410
Because you can see each other when you want to.

604
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,210
Ran.

605
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:36,110
Yes, I rarely get to see Kyogoku, too.

606
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,010
The troubles of girls are endless.

607
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,610
In comparison, the uncles are really energetic.

608
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,610
Mr. Sakura, it's 9 o'clock.

609
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,810
Mr. Sakura.

610
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,710
Please excuse me.

611
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,110
Where did he go?

612
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,810
That's strange.

613
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,310
Mr. Sakura?

614
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,310
What's with the scream just now?

615
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,010
Someone, help!

616
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,410
What's wrong?

617
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,410
Mr. Sakura…

618
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,910
Mr. Sakura…

619
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,410
No one is allowed in.

620
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,310
Ran, call the police.

621
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,110
Sure.

622
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,110
The carotid artery was slashed with a sharp weapon.

623
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,710
The cut is perfect.

624
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,810
Should be the same murderer as the serial-killer case.

625
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,010
I keep thinking that I've met you somewhere.

626
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,210
Are you the junior detective,

627
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,910
Heiji Hattori?

628
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,010
Yes.

629
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:31,110
Before the police arrive, please wait in your rooms.

630
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,910
Do not come out.

631
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,210
Got it.

632
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,210
Mr. Sakura seems to have gotten killed

633
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,810
while looking for something in the warehouse.

634
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,410
What was he looking for?

635
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,610
The button of the coat got torn off,

636
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,610
probably because there were gloves on

637
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,710
so it'd be too much trouble to unbutton it.

638
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,710
But the wallet filled with money is still here,

639
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,310
so it's not for money.

640
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,510
Don't touch the body.

641
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,510
How many times do I have to say this for you to understand?

642
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,910
Ouch!

643
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,710
I'm Ayanokoji from the Kyoto Police Department.

644
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,810
Thank you for your hard work. Please come in.

645
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,010
You guard the door.

646
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,710
Roger that.

647
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,410
Isn't this a police officer in Kyoto?

648
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,710
You got here so fast.

649
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,410
Where's your chipmunk?

650
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,910
I don't always take it with me.

651
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,010
What do you think? Did someone outside do it?

652
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,110
We can't eliminate the possibility,

653
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,810
but if the door was opened and made a sound,

654
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,210
the owner would have noticed,

655
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,910
Besides,

656
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,510
the murderer knew that Mr. Sakura

657
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,110
would go to the warehouse for some reason.

658
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,310
In other words,

659
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,510
he probably knew Mr. Sakura,

660
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:05,410
Saijo, Ryuen, Mizuo and the others.

661
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,910
The three of them

662
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,410
have been to the bathroom

663
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,610
after Mr. Sakura and Ran left.

664
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,110
There is also a staircase leading to the basement next to it.

665
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,210
This means that the three could have gone
to the warehouse and killed Mr. Sakura

666
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:24,210
when they pretended to go to the bathroom.

667
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,310
But one thing feels out of place.

668
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,610
Why did Suzu Chika go with Mizuo

669
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,910
to the bathroom?

670
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,610
The geishas seem to do that.

671
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,910
But she didn't do that with Ryuen and Saijo.

672
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,710
That's because she happened to be playing a game with my uncle.

673
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,110
We can also say that

674
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,310
they might have specifically picked that time to go to the bathroom.

675
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,610
If that's the case,

676
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,110
the murderer is either Ryuen or Saijo.

677
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,110
If Suzu Chika is not an accomplice,

678
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,510
then Mizuo should be innocent.

679
00:43:59,110 --> 00:43:59,810
Yes.

680
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,710
Then let's go.

681
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,110
Stop pretending.

682
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,810
Did you find something in Mr. Sakura's upper pocket?

683
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,210
Well.

684
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,410
Mr. Sakura's shop should be on Teramachi Street, right?

685
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,970
(Sakura Antique Shop)

686
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,510
Gikeki.

687
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,410
Iseno Saburo.

688
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,910
Hattori.

689
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,410
What? Mr. Sakura is Iseno Saburo?

690
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:42,910
What is this?

691
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,010
This is...

692
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,910
a copy of the painting.

693
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,910
What is going on?

694
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,010
Mr. Sakura also had this painting, which means

695
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:56,310
the letter was sent by Mr. Sakura to Sannou Temple.

696
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,610
But for what?

697
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:01,610
What?

698
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,110
Mr. Sakura was Iseno Saburo.

699
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,610
Yes, it looks like he was a member of Genjibotaru.

700
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,210
Wait a minute, the one who got killed is...

701
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,610
Could the next one be me, the one they missed?

702
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,010
If this is the case, it should've happened a long time ago.

703
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,710
If the painting in Mr. Sakura's house

704
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,410
is a copy of the original,

705
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,610
wouldn't it be very likely that Mr. Sakura
carried the original with him

706
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,210
and it got taken away by the murderer?

707
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,210
I see.

708
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,110
The murderer didn't expect Mr. Sakura to keep a copy in advance.

709
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,810
So who is the murderer?

710
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,110
I think the murderer is among Mr. Ryuen, Mr. Saijo.

711
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,010
Mr. Mizuo and Ms. Suzu Chika.

712
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,310
But none of them had a weapon with them.

713
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,710
After the two of you left,

714
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,610
the police did a search.

715
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,410
How could someone still carry a weapon

716
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,010
after killing someone?

717
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,910
It must have been thrown away or hidden.

718
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,510
But it wasn't found in the store either.

719
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,810
How about the Misogi River?

720
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,610
Could it be thrown out of the glass window in the basement?

721
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,910
Right? I think so, too.

722
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,610
Suzuki said she heard

723
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,210
the sound of something falling into the Misogi River.

724
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,110
Really?

725
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:25,110
Yes, but the police searched the river

726
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,110
and found nothing.

727
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,010
That's strange.

728
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,110
In this case, there must be an accomplice.

729
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,810
The accomplice outside picked up the murder weapon from the river.

730
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,610
This is impossible.

731
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,510
Why? Ku…Conan.

732
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,810
It's a full moon tonight, so it's very bright outside.

733
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,810
The balcony floor has a gap that allows one to see the river below.

734
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,910
If there is an accomplice over there,

735
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,510
Ran-chan and the others should've noticed.

736
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,710
That's true.

737
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,210
The truth is,

738
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,510
the murderer is someone outside.

739
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,210
Before Ran and the others got to the balcony,

740
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,610
the murderer went in from the glass window downstairs,

741
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,310
hid in a place somewhere like the bathroom,

742
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,810
killed Mr. Sakura while he came in looking for something,

743
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,910
and then ran away with the murder weapon through the glass window.

744
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,810
But none of us saw anyone suspicious.

745
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,010
There are no witnesses by the riverbank either.

746
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,410
It's a coincidence.

747
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,810
The murderer had better luck.

748
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,110
I feel like something's not right.

749
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,910
That guy is from Mount Kurama...

750
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,510
Toyama, don't let go!

751
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,710
What?

752
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,210
Stay here, okay?

753
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:39,510
Heiji!

754
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:00,110
Do you want to have a showdown with me? That works.

755
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,110
What? There are flaws everywhere.

756
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,410
Wearing a wristband.

757
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,410
Are you the murderer who killed Mr. Sakura?

758
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:36,410
Then try it here just like back then.

759
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,910
This is not what you want.

760
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,910
I can't see clearly anymore.

761
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,810
Inspector, here!

762
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,310
Heiji! Are you okay?

763
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,710
Toyama, where's the police?

764
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,910
It was obviously a bluff.

765
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,510
Where did you learn this?

766
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,110
What a terrible woman.

767
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:53,910
Heiji.

768
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,490
(Umekouji Hospital)

769
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,710
Heiji, you're awake.

770
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,910
Toyama.

771
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,410
Thank God.

772
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,310
Worried us to death, Heiji.

773
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,310
Inspector Otaki.

774
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,910
And, who are you again?

775
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:20,110
I am Shiratori from the Police Department.

776
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,110
I heard that Shozo Sakura who got killed was a member of Genjibotaru,

777
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,810
so I rushed over from Tokyo.

778
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,810
Does it still hurt?

779
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,310
A little.

780
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:34,810
The stolen art was found in Sakura's shop.

781
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,110
Are you awake?

782
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,510
Inspector, where's the short knife?

783
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,510
It's going under tests.

784
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:44,410
Tell me immediately when the result comes out.

785
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,610
If the evidence is not enough,

786
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,610
you can use the wound on my shoulder as well.

787
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,610
What evidence?

788
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,010
The evidence to prove that the short knife

789
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,910
is the murder weapon that killed Mr. Sakura.

790
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,710
Actually, it'll be great if someone had come into contact

791
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,110
with the murderer's skin.

792
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,110
What about the motorcycle? Isn't there a motorcycle?

793
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,810
That was a stolen one.

794
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,910
The evidence to find the murderer.

795
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:17,310
Also, do you understand what this painting means now?

796
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,610
It was tuck into Mr. Sakura's "Chronicles of Yoshitsune".

797
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,310
Are you sure you don't know?

798
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,110
Don't worry then.

799
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,610
Just stay put then.

800
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,410
I'll be going as well.

801
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,910
Take care and feel better soon, Heiji.

802
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,810
I'll give dad a call.

803
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,810
Let me ask the doctor for you.

804
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,010
Conan is with me.

805
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:54,910
Ran.

806
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,010
I'll go out for a bit. please take care of Heiji.

807
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,210
Is it okay? Why don't you stay in the hospital to recover?

808
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,410
It's okay.

809
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,810
But that guy is really strange.

810
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,410
I've never seen that kind of swordsmanship.

811
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,010
He might have added steel bars to the wristband.

812
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,310
I wanted to use the wound to find the murder weapon.

813
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,110
That's why I got myself a cut by the short knife.

814
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,310
I didn't expect him to drop the knife.

815
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,410
Why is that?

816
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,210
Also,

817
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,010
while we were fighting,

818
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,210
the guy actually wanted to pick up this sachet that I dropped.

819
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,610
All things that one can't figure out.

820
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,010
Could the one wearing an old man's mask

821
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,510
be your first love?

822
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,510
You have a point.

823
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,610
How could there be such a thing?

824
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,130
(Mizuo's House)

825
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,010
You were attacked later.

826
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,110
I'm sorry but,

827
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,710
I wanted to ask about Mr. Mizuo's alibi.

828
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:05,210
The murderer wore the mask of the old man in Noh theatre.

829
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,410
Old man's mask.

830
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,610
Also, Mr. Saijo

831
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,410
and Mr. Ryuen's alibis would be greatly appreciated as well.

832
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,110
We have to be questioned, too?

833
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,310
Seriously?

834
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,810
I came here today to talk about the murderer of Mr. Sakura

835
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:21,210
with Suzu Chika in a party of four.

836
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:22,310
Right?

837
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:28,110
It's okay. I went straight home to sleep right after yesterday.

838
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,410
But I'm still single,

839
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,210
and my room is far from my mom's room.

840
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:36,910
I can't prove whether I've been at home all that time.

841
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,310
Same here.

842
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,210
I live alone on the second floor of the store on Teramachi Street.

843
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,110
After I returned to the temple,

844
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:49,010
I read the scriptures in the main hall for a while.
Then I fell asleep.

845
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,810
No witnesses.

846
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:51,910
I see.

847
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:53,710
I have another question.

848
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,410
Has anyone practiced archery?

849
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,610
Archery? No.

850
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,910
I once used a Catalpa Bow for the Noh play called
"Appreciating the Fallen Leaves".

851
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,610
I once used the bow and arrow to disperse evil spirits.

852
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,210
So was there anyone in the tea house that knew archery?

853
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,910
Sounds like Yamakura.

854
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,500
Does that Yamakura use bow and arrows?

855
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,840
(Tae Yamakura)
But she wasn't present at the time.

856
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,310
But she wasn't present at the time

857
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,410
Oh no...

858
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:26,910
Excuse me.

859
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,310
She is coming.

860
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,110
What?

861
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:30,810
What's wrong?

862
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,010
Please.

863
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,210
Are you Miss Suzu Chika?

864
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,710
Yes.

865
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,610
You must be surprised by how different she looks.

866
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:39,910
Please come in.

867
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,510
OK, thanks.

868
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,110
Thanks for visiting last night.

869
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,710
Please come back again.

870
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:59,410
Don't mention it.

871
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,110
Thanks, bye.

872
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,310
Sannou Temple is on Rokkaku street.

873
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,710
This is Ebisu Avenue.

Ane-San-Rokkaku…

876
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,210
So it should be the sixth street.

877
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:26,110
Maru-Take-Ebisu-Ni-Oshi-Oike

878
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,210
What's the song you just sang now?

879
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,810
We call it the Temari song.

880
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,510
It's a song made up with all the major roads
in Kyoto that run east to west

881
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,110
appearing in the order of north to south.

882
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:43,710

Setta-Chara, chara-Uonotana

886
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:01,010
through Rokujo-Santetsu

887
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,510
after Shichijo comes Hachi-Kujo

888
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,210
Kujo, toji comes at the end

889
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,610
Kids in Kyoto

890
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,110
all sing this song to remember the names of the streets in Kyoto.

891
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,210
Then you are also from Kyoto.

892
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,910
Yes.

893
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:22,610
How old are you?

894
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,910
19 years old.

895
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:24,910
19.

896
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,810
Then this is Oike Street.

897
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,010
I'll be going.

898
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:37,810
Goodbye.

899
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:38,910
Goodbye.

900
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,010
Are you thinking that she is…

901
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,410
Absolutely right.

902
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,910
She was born in Kyoto and is two years older than me.

903
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,310
But don't the kids in Kyoto all sing that song?

904
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,410
I've reunited with her at last.

905
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:54,910
Hey.

906
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,510
Heiji, what are you doing?

907
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,210
It's ridiculous to leave the hospital like this.

908
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,810
Officer Otaki.

909
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,610
(Kyoto Prefecture Police)
Let's not talk about this yet.

910
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,010
(Kyoto Prefecture Police)
The results of the blood test came out.

911
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:05,310
The result of the blood test came out.

912
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,310
The blood on the handle of the short knife

913
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:12,610
is found to be of the same blood type as that of Mr. Sakura's.

914
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:17,310
The marks that the sword left are the same as
the marks on Sakura's body as well.

915
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:18,310
Really?

916
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,710
Heiji, I've told you the results.

917
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,610
But don't you mess around.

918
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,910
If anything happens to you,

919
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,310
I won't know what to say to your dad...

920
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,810
I got it.

921
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,710
Thank you, Inspector Otaki.

922
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,210
So it seems that the person who attacked me

923
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:41,810
is the murderer who killed Mr. Sakura.

924
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:48,910
So those four people who couldn't get rid of
the weapon couldn't be the murderer.

925
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,010
Conan, what are you doing?

926
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,610
Why are you guys here?

927
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,510
We solved the riddle of the Doctor,

928
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,410
so he brought us to Kyoto.

929
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,310
But Genta

930
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,110
got lost.

931
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:20,510
Then use the detective badge.

932
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,610
I've called him, and we've been in touch,

933
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,510
but Genta doesn't understand Kanji characters

934
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,610
so he can't tell us where he is now.

935
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,410
So I wanted to use your glasses to find him.

936
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,110
OK, leave it to me.

937
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,310
This is interesting, there.

938
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,010
Yeah.

939
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,710
There seems to be a case in your area, too.

940
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:58,810
Yes, I will tell you the details later.

941
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,710
Wait a minute, Ai, give me the medicine.

942
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,710
What's that?

943
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,810
Hunger suppressing medicine.

944
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:14,810
It's developed by the doctor for those
attending wedding and funeral banquets.

945
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,310
For those who can't drink,

946
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,310
there's a medication that turns one's face red immediately.

947
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:21,910
For those who want to take time off,

948
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,010
there's a medication that shows symptoms
of a bad cold immediately after taking it.

949
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,110
These are all developed by Ai.

950
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,710
So these are useless.

951
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,710
(Rokkaku Temple)
It's here. This is Rokkaku.

952
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,010
He's here!

953
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:38,810
Great!

954
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,610
Mother.

955
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,210
Genta is there.

956
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,110
I'm saved!

957
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,910
Great, Genta!

958
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,510
I thought I would never see you again in my lifetime!

959
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,310
Me, too.

960
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,510
But this thing is really convenient,

961
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,010
the badge with a signal sensor.

962
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:57,810
Yeah!

963
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:02,510
The frequency of the signal from this transmitter
is the same as that of the glasses.

964
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,610
Hattori.

965
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,710
I see.

966
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,210
What's up?

967
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,010
Kudo, could it be?

968
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,710
It must be.

969
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:20,510
Yes.

970
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,710
What the lady heard was indeed the sound
of the murder weapon falling into the river.

971
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,310
So the murderer is indeed one of those four people.

972
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,810
No, one of those three.

973
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:34,710
How could my first love be a murderer?

974
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:36,210
Here we go again.

975
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,810
But there is still something I find strange.

976
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:44,110
The song I just heard is different from the one I remember.

977
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,410
My first love

978
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:50,210
sang "Yome-san-Rokkaku" instead of "Ane-san-Rokkaku".

979
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,210
Why is that?

980
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,710
How would I know?

981
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,010
Found it! The broken pieces of the mask.

982
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,410
Police Department,

983
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,910
What are you thinking?

984
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,110
Is it this one?

985
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,910
Things worn on the three people killed in Tokyo.

986
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,210
One was wearing a hat; one was wearing a scarf.

987
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,110
And another was wearing gloves.

988
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,810
The colors, styles, and textures are the same.

989
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,910
Don't you think it's weird?

990
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,710
Really strange.

991
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,410
What's weird?

992
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:49,410
For example, if Shiratori wore these three
by himself, then it'd feel normal.

993
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,610
But if Inspector Megure wore this hat,

994
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,410
and I wore this scarf,

995
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,710
then Takagi wore these gloves,

996
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,910
wouldn't you think it's weird?

997
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,410
Indeed.

998
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:01,210
It literally feels like Shiratori was dead,

999
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,010
and the three of us divided his belongings.

1000
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,210
That's it.

1001
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,410
What's going on?

1002
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,410
I'm hungry.

1003
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,010
Bear with it.

1004
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:18,010
Suzu Chika's mom worked as a geisha in Miyagawa.

1005
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:20,210
She died of an illness when Suzu Chika was five years old.

1006
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,810
And she was a single mother.

1007
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:27,310
Later, Suzu Chika was adopted by the teahouse owner, Yamakura,

1008
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:28,610
and she was raised by Yamakura.

1009
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,110
What does a single mother mean?

1010
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,410
I was wondering the same thing.

1011
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:36,110
A woman who gives birth to a child without getting married?

1012
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:39,510
Although I don't know who her father is,

1013
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:43,110
there was money sent to her anonymously every month.

1014
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:48,110
But for some reason it suddenly stopped three months ago.

1015
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:52,910
It is quite perplexing indeed.

1016
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,010
Three months ago?

1017
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,810
But how did you find out about this, Inspector Shiratori?

1018
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,110
Did you learn about it from Inspector Ayanakoji?

1019
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,510
No.

1020
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,110
Don't underestimate me.

1021
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,410
I've got my ways in Gion.

1022
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,410
Is that something to be proud of?

1023
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:12,410
Although that guy is my opponent,

1024
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,410
I don't want to be compared with someone
who always carries a chipmunk.

1025
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,710
Chipmunk?

1026
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,910
He always has it in his pocket.

1027
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,310
At least he didn't bring it to the scene of the crime.

1028
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,610
Chipmunk?

1029
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,210
This is Inspector Shiratori.

1030
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,510
This is Megure.

1031
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:32,410
Another possibility emerged in the Benkei and Yoshitsune case.

1032
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,310
Belongings.

1033
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,810
If you think about it this way, the riddle will be solved.

1034
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:43,210
In other words, we reasoned that Benkei or Yoshitsune
might be dead already.

1035
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,210
I see!

1036
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:57,710
Mr. Mouri.

1037
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:01,610
Do you really know who murdered Mr. Sakura?

1038
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:02,610
Yes

1039
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,310
Now, please listen.

1040
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,510
The murderer is you, Ms. Suzu Chika.

1041
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,110
Nonsense!

1042
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,010
What a mess!

1043
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,610
Is he okay?

1044
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:18,710
Anyway, let him finish first.

1045
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:23,410
The motive is to avenge your father who got killed.

1046
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:28,310
Your father is Yoshitsune, the leader of the gang of robbers.

1047
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,110
Yoshitsune was killed by his men who betrayed him three months ago,

1048
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,010
so the money that got sent to Suzu Chika also stopped.

1049
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,210
I see.

1050
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:41,410
You have another accomplice,

1051
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:42,810
Benkei.

1052
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,310
Benkei?

1053
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,510
Who is this Benkei?

1054
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,510
Inspector Ayanokoji.

1055
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,310
It's you.

1056
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:54,710
Ms. Suzu Chika, when you went to the teahouse,

1057
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,910
you had something with you.

1058
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,410
The dagger and the chipmunk raised by Inspector Ayanakoji.

1059
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,310
So cute!

1060
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,810
This chipmunk is the key to the crime.

1061
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:14,010
Ms. Suzu Chika, you pretended to go to the bathroom
in the middle of the banquet,

1062
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,010
and went on to kill Mr. Sakura in the warehouse.

1063
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,110
You tied the short knife on the chipmunk that hid there in advance,

1064
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,010
and then let it out from the glass window.

1065
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:27,510
The chipmunk jumped into the river
and swam to the lower reaches of the river,

1066
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:31,610
where Inspector Ayanokoji awaited to retrieve the knife.

1067
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:35,010
He then used this knife to attack Heiji.

1068
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,210
I see!

1069
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,710
So that splashing sound was caused
by the chipmunk jumping into the water.

1070
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:43,710
Other than the case of Mr. Sakura, the other two crimes
were also committed by the two of you.

1071
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:46,510
Inspector, do you know archery?

1072
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,810
For something so troublesome, how would I know it?

1073
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,310
Is that so?

1074
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,510
But Ms. Suzu Chika,

1075
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,010
I heard that people who practice archery

1076
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:59,610
often get themselves injured at this very spot.

1077
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,210
It's true.

1078
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:05,310
This wound of mine indeed came from archery practice,

1079
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:09,310
but I just started learning it.

1080
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:12,210
How could I possibly kill someone with it?

1081
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,410
That's what I thought, too.

1082
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,610
This should be proof that she's a beginner
because she has a wound near her thumb.

1083
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:20,510
I heard this from my friends in the archery club.

1084
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:24,310
And the deceased had no reason to divide the belongings.

1085
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,810
Mr. Mouri,

1086
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,010
do you really think that this girl is a murderer?

1087
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,010
Well...

1088
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,610
Stop joking.

1089
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:35,010
This kid is very busy with singing, dancing and tea ceremony,

1090
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,710
where does she get the time to kill?

1091
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,010
What?

1092
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:41,310
That chipmunk,

1093
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:44,610
I'm afraid it can't carry a short knife with such a small body.

1094
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,310
So annoying.

1095
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,510
I'll prove it to you.

1096
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,410
Move, chipmunk.

1097
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:56,010
I can't stand it anymore.

1098
01:07:56,310 --> 01:08:00,210
You are acting like this to get out of the crime, aren't you?

1099
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,310
Stop it.

1100
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:06,010
Poor chipmunk, uncle.

1101
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,010
This is animal cruelty.

1102
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,210
Shut up, you kids.

1103
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:12,310
Genta, save the chipmunk.

1104
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,110
Okay.

1105
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:14,610
Kudo.

1106
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,710
Thanks to Uncle, I got the murderer now.

1107
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,410
Me, too.

1108
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:25,110
It had to be someone good at archery to say such a thing.

1109
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,210
We just need evidence now.

1110
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,310
And the whereabouts of that Buddha statue.

1111
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:33,010
Little chipmunk, poor baby.

1112
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,310
Let's feed it with something.

1113
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,210
I have an acorn.

1114
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,510
This feels like the children's song, "Donguri Koro Koro".

1115
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,410
Donguri Koro Koro.

1116
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,510
Could it be...

1117
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,110
What's wrong, Kudo?

1118
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:01,210
It suddenly occurred to me that the copy
of the painting might refer to the name of a street in Kyoto.

1119
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,310
What are you saying?

1120
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:08,010
The first is the east-west street.

1121
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:10,020
If the fifth floor is

1122
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,040
(Fifth Street)
the fifth street

1123
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,540
and the fourth floor

1124
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,310
(Fourth Street)
is the fourth street.

1125
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:18,220
Between the third floor and the second floor,

1126
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,150
that's the middle of the third and second street.

1127
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,120
(Oike Street)
That's Oike Street.

1128
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,700
(Oike Street)
Then the evidence for this is would be...

1129
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,510
Donguri Koro Koro.

1130
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,410
Then there is a north-south road.

1131
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,610
(Ogawa Street)
There is a song called "Ogawa Spring" that talks about violets.

1132
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,810
(Ogawa Street)
So it's Ogawa Street.

1133
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,100
(Karasuma Street)
Tengu is mentioned in "Karasu Tengu".

1134
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,410
(Karasuma Street)
So it's Karasuma Street.

1135
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,800
(Mount Fuji)
Then there is the character of Mt. Fuji,

1136
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,520
(Tominokoji Street)
so it is Tominokoji Street.

1137
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,910
What is that chicken?

1138
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,010
The loach is probably the "Yanagi Pot".

1139
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:49,560
(Yanaginobanba Street)
So it's Yanaginobanba Street?

1140
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,010
Chicken is...

1141
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,410
Isn't it Nishinotoin Street?

1142
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,410
(Nishinotoin Street)
Because the chicken head points to the west.

1143
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,610
That's so hard.

1144
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,910
And what's this?

1145
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,310
The cicada is of the "large brown cicada",

1146
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,920
(Aburanokoji Street)
so it is Aburanokoji Street.

1147
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,800
(Youkoji Street)
Tengu is Toromaru Street.

1148
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,600
Goldfish eats wheat bran,

1149
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,240
(Fuyacho Street)
so it's Fuyacho Street.

1150
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,610
Then the violets and Mount Fuji share the same color.

1151
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:22,110
Chicken and loach, cicada and goldfish

1152
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:24,710
Then connect Tengu with Tengu.

1153
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,710
King? What's with this word "King"?

1154
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,110
There's an extra dot.

1155
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:32,710
It should be like this.

1156
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:39,310
Jade, meaning there's a treasure.

1157
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,010
So this place is...

1158
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,610
Bukkoji Temple.

1159
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:46,810
This is where we find the treasure.

1160
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,510
What's wrong?

1161
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,870
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

1162
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,210
(Rokkaku Temple)

1163
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:16,210
Excuse me.

1164
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,510
How do you feel?

1165
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,410
Much better.

1166
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,010
Hattori.

1167
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:27,610
You sneaked into Sannou Temple eight years ago, didn't you?

1168
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,610
How did you know that?

1169
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,610
Idiot.

1170
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:34,110
I knew everything when I saw your expression
when you were looking at the cherry blossoms.

1171
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:37,310
There happened to be the lattice window you mentioned.

1172
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,910
Yeah.

1173
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:44,210
I found this crystal bead just under the cherry blossom tree.

1174
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,310
I don't want to disappoint you.

1175
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,610
But this crystal bead,

1176
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:51,510
I'm afraid it wasn't from your first crush.

1177
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,110
What are you saying?

1178
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,820
I'm afraid this is

1179
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:59,500
(Urna)
the urna on the forehead of the stolen Buddha statue in Sannou Temple.

1180
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,910
Urna.

1181
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:05,210
Is it the shiny thing in the middle of the Buddha's forehead?

1182
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:05,810
Yep.

1183
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,910
Buddha statues often use crystal beads to make urna.

1184
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:12,110
The masks in Noh plays are also like this.

1185
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,110
This is what I think.

1186
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:18,110
Eight years ago, the Genjibotaru gang

1187
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,710
sneaked into the Sannou Temple,

1188
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,110
and stole the hidden Buddha statue.

1189
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,710
But on the way out,

1190
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,810
the urna fell off.

1191
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,310
The leader, Yoshitsune, noticed this

1192
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:43,110
and sent a subordinate to find it at Sannou Temple.

1193
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,210
Right then...

1194
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:58,610
I want red bean soup.

1195
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,510
I want honey bean ice.

1196
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:07,510
The helpless leader kept the Buddha statue
in the warehouse that Mr. Sakura searched in.

1197
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:10,510
But eight years later, the murderer found out by accident

1198
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:14,210
that you were the boy from eight years ago.

1199
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:15,810
Because of the magazine?

1200
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,110
At the same time,

1201
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,710
there were also incidents inside the gang.

1202
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:26,110
I think the leader might have been seriously ill.

1203
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,110
The leader knows that he's dying,

1204
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:32,110
so he hid the Buddha statue he stole from Sannou Temple elsewhere.

1205
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:36,110
He then divided the hits of the location to his men in pieces.

1206
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:41,110
He left his last words, stating that the one
who solves the riddle will become the new leader.

1207
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,110
He then died.

1208
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:50,410
The men desperately tried to solve the riddle, but failed.

1209
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,310
At that time,

1210
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:54,210
Mr. Sakura

1211
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,510
actively reached out to the murderer for collaboration.

1212
01:13:56,910 --> 01:14:03,210
He used the murderer's swordsmanship
to kill all the other accomplices,

1213
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:07,910
then the two of them would go look for the Buddha statue and urna,

1214
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:11,110
and then split money from selling it.

1215
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,110
Yes.

1216
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:17,210
I'm afraid only Mr. Sakura, the only antique dealer in the gang,

1217
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:20,510
had the channels for selling the stolen goods.

1218
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,910
That's why he firmly believed that he was absolutely safe.

1219
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,310
The murderer pretended to listen to Mr. Sakura.

1220
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:29,610
But he actually had planned to

1221
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:32,110
kill all the accomplices and to take the treasure for himself.

1222
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,810
But to achieve this,

1223
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,400
(Bukkoji Temple)in any case, he had to solve
the riddle of the painting left by the leader.

1224
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,310
So the murderer...

1225
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:43,610
Thought of having the famous detective,
Kogoro Mouri, to solve the riddle for him.

1226
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,410
Bukkoji Temple, we're here.

1227
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:53,310
But is the Buddha statue really hidden here?

1228
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,810
I have a feeling that something's wrong.

1229
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:00,810
What is it?

1230
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,310
Kudo, what have you got?

1231
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,910
This…

1232
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,210
Gyokuryuji Temple

1233
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,910
The point in the painting, could it refer to this?

1234
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,710
Toyama. It's me.

1235
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,710
The girl's with me.

1236
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:24,010
Come to the Gyokuryuji Temple on Mount Kurama alone an hour later.

1237
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:25,910
If you dare call the police,

1238
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,410
she'll be dead.

1239
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:30,210
Heiji, don't come. You'll get yourself killed!

1240
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:31,910
Toyama, Toyama!

1241
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:33,610
Hattori.

1242
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:37,010
It's Toyama. She got kidnapped.

1243
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,610
What?

1244
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,810
He asked me to get to Gyokuryuji Temple on Mount Kurama

1245
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,910
an hour later by myself.

1246
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,210
Gyokuryuji Temple.

1247
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:48,210
Good.

1248
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,910
Let's go together now.

1249
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:56,310
Hattori!

1250
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,180
(Modoribashi Bridge)

1251
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:04,370
The dutiful son who learned of his father's death
hurried back to Kyoto.

1252
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:07,710
It just so happened that the funeral procession passed this bridge.

1253
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:11,390
At that moment, the father suddenly woke.

1254
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,870
Legend has it, the father and the dutiful son got to speak in the end.

1255
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,710
Hello.

1256
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,490
(Mount Kurama)

1257
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:26,540
(Gyokuryuji Temple)

1258
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,510
The leader has instructed

1259
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,010
that the knife will be placed in Benkei's drawer.

1260
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,310
The bows and arrows are in the Rokkaku drawer.

1261
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,810
Benkei's drawer is in...

1262
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,810
Starting from the top, 1 2 3...

1263
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,510
What are you talking about?

1264
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,810
Benkei and Rokkaku drawer.

1265
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:55,810
Bukkoji Temple?

1266
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,910
I heard the two of them saying that.

1267
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:07,810
Seriously, where did those two go?

1268
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:11,010
Toyama didn't answer her phone either.

1269
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,210
Bukkoji Temple.

1270
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,310
I'm hungry.

1271
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,410
Really? We'll be home soon.

1272
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,510
Excuse me,

1273
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:21,310
where is this Gyokuryuji Temple?

1274
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,410
In the deep mountains of Mount Kurama.

1275
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,210
But I heard that it was abandoned a long time ago.

1276
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:28,710
Thanks.

1277
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:32,210
Kurama Mountain.

1278
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:42,310
So slow.

1279
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,210
Knowing that it is a trap, how can one be fooled so easily?

1280
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,010
Really?

1281
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:50,810
Probably just scared.

1282
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,410
Heiji.

1283
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,610
You didn't hurt Toyama,

1284
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,910
did you?

1285
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:17,010
I'm fine, Heiji.

1286
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:20,710
This is what you really wanted, right?

1287
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:27,310
In order to retrieve this crystal bead,

1288
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,110
you attacked me here yesterday.

1289
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,010
But you failed.

1290
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,410
Then, to take this treasure for your own,

1291
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,610
you killed Mr. Sakura at the teahouse in Ponto-cho.

1292
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:43,010
Why did you choose Ponto-cho instead of other places?

1293
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:46,510
Because it was the only place with a river
flowing behind the teahouse.

1294
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,610
River?

1295
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:51,510
After you killed Mr. Sakura who was looking for
the Buddha statue in the warehouse,

1296
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:55,510
you placed the company's anti-theft tracker
used to find missing children

1297
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,710
in an empty bottle with the weapon, and dumped them together.

1298
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:05,710
Then you logged into the security company's webpage
with your mobile phone,

1299
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:08,610
found the location of the tracker and reclaimed it.

1300
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,510
You then hid and waited for me,

1301
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:15,110
trying to kill me with the same short knife.

1302
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:21,510
Although you failed because of Tomoya,

1303
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:25,110
you deliberately left a short knife for disguise,

1304
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:29,110
so that people would think it was the murderer
who fled the tea house with a weapon.

1305
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:31,810
Right, Mr. Saijo?

1306
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,410
No, maybe I should call you Musashibo Benkei.

1307
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:45,610
Indeed the high school detective, Heiji Hattori, from Naniwa Castle.

1308
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,810
How did you know that I am the murderer?

1309
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,710
Because you pretended that you didn't know archery.

1310
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,710
But when you sat,

1311
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:56,410
you moved your right foot back half a step before sitting down.

1312
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,410
(Half-foot drag)
That is called "half-foot drag".

1313
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,940
(Half-foot drag)
People who practice archery have the habit of sitting like that.

1314
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:06,230
(The pronunciation of arrow pillow is the same as Yamakura)
So when asked who knows archery,

1315
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,540
you accidentally said "yamakura".

1316
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:11,410
It seems like Yamakura...

1317
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:14,710
You didn't mean "Yamakura", the owner of the teahouse.

1318
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,020
Instead,

1319
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,910
(Yamakura)
you wanted to say "yamakura, the arrow pillow".

1320
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:21,510
(Yamakura)That is, the second joint of the thumb
at left hand purlicue when shooting an arrow with a bow.

1321
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,710
I think you wanted to say

1322
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:29,410
it seems like Suzu Chika's yamakura is injured.

1323
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,310
However, only those who practice archery
would know the word "yamakura".

1324
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:37,710
Besides, Ryuen doesn't know archery,

1325
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:40,510
and he even mispronounced bow and arrow.

1326
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:46,110
Ryuen and I used to practice in the same kendo field.

1327
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:48,210
But one day,

1328
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,110
I learned that there is an ancient school of kendo
called Yoshitsune in Kyoto.

1329
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:55,310
So I started to study Chronicles of Yoshitsune by myself.

1330
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:58,310
I left the kendo field two years ago,

1331
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:01,510
and became the heir of Chronicles of Yoshitsune.

1332
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:03,810
Benkei's Yoshitsune.

1333
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:08,610
I wanted to be Yoshitsune more than being Benkei.

1334
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,510
Do you know how much I wanted to be Yoshitsune?

1335
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,910
But the position of Yoshitsune was occupied by the leader.

1336
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:20,410
I myself, the noblest in the gang, became Benkei.

1337
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:24,710
If you want to have the Buddha statue to yourself,
sure enough, it's for the money.

1338
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,410
Yes, but not for selfish desires.

1339
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,610
I will use the money to build a dojo in Kyoto.

1340
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:33,510
The Chief Priest has always been leading the temple here.

1341
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:37,010
Even after the temple was abandoned, he has been in charge of it.

1342
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:40,810
I asked him to let me be the dojo of Yoshitsune.

1343
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:44,110
But the leader passed away three months ago.

1344
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:46,010
The temple will be demolished,

1345
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,910
and it can no longer be used as a dojo.

1346
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,310
I want to ask you something.

1347
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,910
Were you just using Mr. Ryuen?

1348
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,710
Yes, I heard him mentioning the Buddha statue before,

1349
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,910
so after I sent the letter to Sannou Temple,

1350
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:04,010
he indeed came to discuss it with me.

1351
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:08,910
I recommended Kogoro Mouri to come here specifically.

1352
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,010
I killed Sakura because even without him,

1353
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:16,610
I'll also be able to find buyers of the Buddha statue.

1354
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:20,910
Thanks to the convenient Internet.

1355
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,710
So, let's stop here.

1356
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,910
Hurry up and hand over the crystal bead.

1357
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,510
I can give it to you, but you have to let Toyama go first.

1358
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:29,610
OK.

1359
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:32,310
Only if you tell me where the Buddha statue is.

1360
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:33,310
What?

1361
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,310
Come on, where is the Buddha statue?

1362
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,210
In this temple.

1363
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,310
What?

1364
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:41,610
This is the so-called riding a donkey to find a donkey.

1365
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:42,710
That's nonsense!

1366
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:45,810
I searched through this temple a long time ago
and it was nowhere to be found!

1367
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:46,810
I'm not talking nonsense.

1368
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,510
Toyama, run!

1369
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:06,310
Heiji!

1370
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:27,010
They are my beloved apprentices.

1371
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,910
Don't move.

1372
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,110
Heiji!

1373
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,810
Stop it. He is not Heiji!

1374
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:55,110
Who are you? Who?

1375
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:57,710
Shinichi Kudo.

1376
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:00,710
A detective.

1377
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:02,110
What?

1378
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,710
What did you say?

1379
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,610
You let him take the medicine?

1380
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:08,110
Kudo called and asked me

1381
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:13,310
if there was a way to temporarily change back to Shinichi Kudo.

1382
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:18,410
But the antidote test product of APTX4869 was gone.

1383
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:23,310
And Paikaru was taken as a cold medicine so

1384
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,810
there are antibodies. It wouldn't work.

1385
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,110
So I suddenly had the idea

1386
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:32,210
that to take the medicine that brings a severe cold first,

1387
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:34,710
and then to have Paikaru afterwards,

1388
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:36,910
done only once,

1389
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:39,710
maybe it could help him change back to his body.

1390
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:41,610
Then what?

1391
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,310
As I expected, the experiment was very successful.

1392
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:48,010
Kudo changed back to himself.

1393
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,410
But because it's a bad cold,

1394
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:52,810
he's very weak.

1395
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:54,810
We can't guarantee his safety.

1396
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,910
What about Heiji?

1397
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:01,910
He has to rest before the comprehensive examination tomorrow.

1398
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,110
So Kudo asked me to take care of him.

1399
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,410
Kudo.

1400
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:20,010
Damn, how dare you lie to me!

1401
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,210
I have to let Toyama get out of here first.

1402
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:34,210
But my body is not responding.

1403
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:40,710
Darn, the Paikaru is losing its effect.

1404
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,810
Although you are invincible as a detective,

1405
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:53,410
as a samurai, you're pretty bad.

1406
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:54,510
Hattori.

1407
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,310
Heiji.

1408
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:56,910
Sorry for the wait, Toyama.

1409
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,710
What do you think? Idiot!

1410
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:01,210
What did you do?

1411
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,110
Kudo.

1412
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,110
You stole my clothes,

1413
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:09,910
and

1414
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:12,610
I don't know what you put on your face

1415
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:14,810
but I'm not that dark.

1416
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,910
Really?

1417
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:19,810
Forget it, leave it to me, go now!

1418
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:22,310
Hide before you change.

1419
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,710
Wait until your body recovers and come back.

1420
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:31,210
Stop. I'm your opponent.

1421
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,310
Toyama,

1422
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:36,510
don't tell anyone about Kudo,

1423
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,510
including Ran.

1424
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,410
Not even Ran? Why?

1425
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:41,810
No reason.

1426
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:46,210
It's better not to know if she can't see him.

1427
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:53,210
The two of you won't leave here alive.

1428
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:58,710
This knife is really bad.

1429
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,610
Hurry up!

1430
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:08,710
Did you find him?

1431
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,010
Not yet.

1432
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:11,010
Look harder!

1433
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:12,910
What happened...

1434
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,510
Hush, be quiet. Don't make a sound.

1435
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,410
Shinichi.

1436
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:32,910
Your expression is still the same as then.

1437
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:38,010
Why are you sweating so much?

1438
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:41,310
And what happened to those people just now?

1439
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,710
Where did they hide?

1440
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:48,410
It doesn't matter now. Let's go back first.

1441
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,710
Sorry Ran.

1442
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,410
I can't meet you yet...

1443
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:15,310
It's locked from the inside. The door won't open.

1444
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:16,110
Think of a way!

1445
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,310
The smell of this tatami…

1446
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,610
This is the room that I got locked in.

1447
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:24,410
Go get the axe, hurry up.

1448
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:28,010
Damn, it's only a matter of time before the door is knocked open.

1449
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:30,810
Is there anything to be used as a weapon?

1450
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:38,310
Why is there a big cabinet with so many drawers?

1451
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:42,310
The knife is in Benkei's drawer.

1452
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,510
Bows and arrows are in the Rokkaku drawer.

1453
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:48,110
Heiji, there is a knife in Benkei's drawer.

1454
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:50,110
What? In this drawer?

1455
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,110
But there are so many drawers.

1456
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:55,610
How do I know which one belongs to Benkei?

1457
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,910
I seem to have seen this before.

1458
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:13,010
Isn't the line on the drawer the same as the streets of Kyoto?

1459
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:24,210
Got it. This line is Karasuma Street.

1460
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,910
This line here is Takoyakushido Street.

1461
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:27,410
Wait.

1462
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:31,810
Is it possible that the drawer is named after places?

1463
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:33,210
Places?

1464
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:38,510
Yes, Rokkaku is Rokkaku-do.

1465
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,410
Benkei's drawer is...

1466
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:45,110
The location of Benkei Stone.

1467
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:47,710
From the third Fuyacho Street...

1468
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:48,710
Right, Temari.

1469
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:51,610
Maru-take

1470
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,310
Maru-take...

1471
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:56,610
What's next?

1472
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,710
Damn it. I can't remember.

1473
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:04,310
Maru-Take-Ebisu-Ni-Oshi-Oike

1474
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:08,710
Yome-san-Rokkaku-Tako-Nishiki

1475
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,410
Heiji, the third line is the second street above Nishiki.

1476
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:13,610
The second street above Nishiki.

1477
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:14,810
East-west road.

1478
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,810
Temple Miyuki Fuyacho Tomi.

1479
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:18,510
Fuyacho is the third.

1480
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:19,510
It's here.

1481
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:23,110
Go to hell.

1482
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:42,410
Unity in and out, with a unique knife pattern.

1483
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:45,010
this knife is Muramasa, right?

1484
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:49,910
Used to deal with the demon possessed by Yoshitsune,

1485
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,910
it could not be better.

1486
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:53,010
What?

1487
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:56,810
Get out of the way!

1488
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,410
What are you guys doing?

1489
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:04,410
Go after him!

1490
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:05,410
Yes!

1491
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:09,810
Listen well.

1492
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:13,010
I'll distract them, and you have to run.

1493
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:15,410
No, I want to be with you.

1494
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,310
Do as I say.

1495
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:19,010
Heiji.

1496
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,010
There they are!

1497
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:21,710
Run!

1498
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,510
You guys go and catch that little girl.

1499
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,310
Yes.

1500
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:42,110
Conan.

1501
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,910
Toyama, where's Heiji?

1502
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:50,010
There.

1503
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:51,910
Hattori!

1504
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,710
Damn it.

1505
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:00,810
I want to call the police, but I have no signal.

1506
01:32:02,610 --> 01:32:03,410
That's it!

1507
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:22,110
Extinguish the fire!

1508
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:28,110
Ok, as long as someone can spot this fire.

1509
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,510
Hey, Ran.

1510
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:34,910
Are you okay?

1511
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,210
Dad.

1512
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,010
Where's Shinichi?

1513
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,310
Are you confused?

1514
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:44,510
Why would he be here?

1515
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:47,810
Speaking of that, why did you fall asleep here?

1516
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:50,210
Dad, why did you come here?

1517
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:51,810
I told him to.

1518
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:54,610
Toyama got kidnapped by the Genjibotaru gang.

1519
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:55,610
Mr. Mouri!

1520
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:12,210
It's time for us to battle for victory.

1521
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:16,210
Can't wait.

1522
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:23,810
I won't be fooled anymore.

1523
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:26,610
Then, how about this?

1524
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,510
A dagger?

1525
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:31,010
This is no ordinary dagger.

1526
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:34,010
The blade is smeared with a poison that kills instantly.

1527
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:35,910
What?

1528
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:39,010
You'll die with a tiny cut.

1529
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:43,010
What a despicable guy.

1530
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,610
It's not good. Heiji is in danger.

1531
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:14,010
There is nowhere to run to now.

1532
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:16,310
There are bows and arrows waiting.

1533
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:23,110
We've got to find a way to save him.

1534
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,010
Conan.

1535
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:25,910
Wait.

1536
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:31,510
Hey, this way!

1537
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:47,810
Watch this!

1538
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,010
Go, Hattori!

1539
01:34:58,210 --> 01:34:59,210
Heiji.

1540
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:29,710
The Benkei who wants to be Yoshitsune, right?

1541
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,810
If you were Benkei,

1542
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:34,910
Yoshitsune would have been killed at the Ataka.

1543
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:36,810
The master got defeated.

1544
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:54,410
Grab them all!

1545
01:35:55,410 --> 01:35:57,110
This is it, Conan.

1546
01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:01,510
Did you call Heiji "Hattori" just now?

1547
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:03,910
I'm sorry, it just came out.

1548
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:04,910
Heiji.

1549
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:06,310
Heiji.

1550
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,610
This temple.

1551
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:23,610
Now all mysteries have been solved.

1552
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:30,810
It seems that the effect of the medicine is only temporary.

1553
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:35,210
But thanks to you, I have collected a lot of important data.

1554
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:38,910
Are you okay? Heiji.

1555
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:40,010
I'm okay.

1556
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:42,910
But where is the Buddha statue?

1557
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,110
Hattori, have you seen Shi...

1558
01:36:50,410 --> 01:36:51,410
What?

1559
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:53,210
Nothing.

1560
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:57,110
Sure enough, it was just a dream.

1561
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,110
(Sannou Temple  Morning)

1562
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:24,010
I'm so sorry.

1563
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:26,810
In the end, I couldn't find the Buddha statue for you.

1564
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:27,810
It's okay.

1565
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:31,310
Don't mention it. It's the Buddha's decision.

1566
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:33,710
Don't worry about it.

1567
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:36,410
Everyone, take care.

1568
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:39,710
Goodbye.

1569
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:49,210
But it's really difficult now.

1570
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:52,910
We only got one hour before the consecration ceremony.

1571
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:54,310
What's so rough?

1572
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:57,210
If you have it, you can show it. If not, then leave it.

1573
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:09,710
Bhaisajyaguru is back.

1574
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,050
(Gyokuryuji Temple  Early morning)

1575
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,110
I found it, Kudo.

1576
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:24,110
Like I said.

1577
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:31,410
Unexpectedly, the shape of the temple was arranged in the word "Jade".

1578
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,010
And the dot sits right at the clock tower.

1579
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:38,210
I didn't even notice it.

1580
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:41,910
Add a cover to "Jade", it becomes “Treasure”.

1581
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:45,110
And treasure cover refers to the roof.

1582
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,610
I see.

1583
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:56,810
It's as good as ever.

1584
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:57,810
Yes.

1585
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:04,410
Those two guys are really the best of partners.

1586
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:07,710
Just like Yoshitsune and Benkei.

1587
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:12,710
Detective Hattori and Mouri?

1588
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:16,110
It seems that you still need practice.

1589
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:22,210
What?

1590
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,710
So next up, Ayumi.

1591
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:29,710
Okay.

1592
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:32,010
It's so cute.

1593
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:34,010
I really want to take you home.

1594
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:37,410
Not this. It's my best friend.

1595
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:41,610
Inspector, you don't have a lot of human friends?

1596
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:47,010
I mistook you two as murderers, so sorry.

1597
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:48,310
No problem.

1598
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:51,810
Actually, I knew who my father was。

1599
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:55,610
And I told him that he didn't have to send me money anymore.

1600
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:57,810
Who is

1601
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:58,910
your father?

1602
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,710
That's a secret.

1603
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:09,010
That old bald donkey.

1604
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:15,410
Maru-Take-Ebisu-Ni-Oshi-Oike

1605
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,310
Yome-san-Rokkaku-Tako-Nishiki…

1606
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:20,110
Not a "yome" but an "ane", fool.

1607
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:22,610
Where did you learn this song?

1608
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,010
From relatives in Kyoto,

1609
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:28,110
when I was in the third grade of elementary school.

1610
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:31,410
I learned it when I went with you.

1611
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:32,510
With me?

1612
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:34,410
You don't remember?

1613
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:38,310
I wasn't even ready but you couldn't wait,

1614
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:41,910
and said you wanted to go and play at Sannou Temple. So you ran out.

1615
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:45,510
My relatives dressed me in a kimono,

1616
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:49,010
and I put my hair in a bun with some makeup.

1617
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:52,310
Then I went to Sannou Temple to look for you.

1618
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:53,510
But I couldn't find you.

1619
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:55,610
So I played with the ball for a while and went back.

1620
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:57,110
Seriously though,

1621
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:59,310
I wanted to let you see

1622
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:02,910
that cherry blossom tree. It was so beautiful
with the cherry blossoms falling down.

1623
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:08,510
Maru-Take-Ebisu-Ni-Oshi-Oike

1624
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:13,510
Yome-san-Rokkaku-Tako-Nishiki…

1625
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:20,810
Finally,

1626
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:22,710
we meet again.

1627
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:25,110
Did you see your first love? Heiji.

1628
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:27,310
Who is it? That geisha?

1629
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:30,510
I won't tell you, ever, idiot.

1630
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:32,710
You petty kid, tell me!

1631
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:36,710
Or maybe I will tell you in 1500 years.

1632
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,510
What?

1633
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:53,610
Conan, what are you doing?

1634
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:00,210
Why are you sweating so much?

1635
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:03,510
Shinichi.

1636
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:08,010
Speaking of that, I called Shinichi

1637
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:11,810
and asked him to act as Heiji to save Toyama,

1638
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:12,710
right?

1639
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:17,510
Yeah, but that guy is really weak.

1640
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:20,110
He ran away midway.

1641
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:23,310
Told me not to tell and he said it first.

1642
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:27,910
That's right.

1643
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:31,910
So it was Shinichi after all.

1644
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,710
I finally saw you.

1645
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:57,010
I want an ice cream.

1646
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:57,610
OK.

1647
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,210
300 yen.

1648
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:04,610
I'm the only one who didn't see the person
I wanted to meet in the end.

1649
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:07,410
Suzuki will definitely see Kyogoku-kun soon.

1650
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:08,510
Most definitely.

1651
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:14,010
But I have no patience to wait for people.

1652
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:16,110
Isn't Ran the same?

1653
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:20,010
I don't hate waiting for someone.

1654
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:24,010
Because the longer you wait,

1655
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,310
when we meet again...

1656
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:31,710
Your expression is still the same as then.

1657
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:33,810
the happier we will be.

1658
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,910
Darn,

1659
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:39,410
I really want Kudo to hear this cheesy line.
