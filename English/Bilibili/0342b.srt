1
00:00:02.394 --> 00:00:06.394
Only one shoe was found by the windmill shed.

2
00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:08.594
This is...

3
00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:09.994
What's going on?

4
00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:12.094
I'm just assuming from the circumstances,

5
00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:16.494
but I think she was dragged away against her will.

6
00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:18.894
No, do you mean she was abducted?

7
00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.394
Don't be ridiculous!

8
00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:23.494
I'm sure she couldn't take staying here and fled.

9
00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:26.194
I checked at the departure gate of Huis Ten Bosch

10
00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:28.794
and found that she hasn't gone outside yet.

11
00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.494
It seems that Akane in the past

12
00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:34.194
had a man that her parent's had decided she get married to.

13
00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:38.494
I think that she is still seeing that man.

14
00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:44.594
And maybe she had planned to embarrass Shinya, to begin with.

15
00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:48.894
No way! I know her best!

16
00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:51.094
Grandma's right.

17
00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:54.194
Shinya, you've been completely deceived.

18
00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:56.494
Like they say from long ago, "Love is blind".

19
00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:57.494
No!

20
00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:01.694
You're talking about the man that was Akane's father's apprentice.

21
00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.894
That's an old story that goes back 10 years ago.

22
00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:05.894
He left 10 years ago

23
00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:09.294
and hasn't contacted her even once, since!

24
00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:13.094
Well, without the bride,

25
00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.994
we can't possibly have the wedding.

26
00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:17.794
After the engagement and all,

27
00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:20.194
if it turns out that the wedding is canceled,

28
00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:21.194
it will be a blow

29
00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:23.094
to the trust that people have in the Ohga Financial Group.

30
00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:26.094
If the wedding is really going to be called off,

31
00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:28.994
then Shinya's promotion to Vice-President of the bank

32
00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:32.594
will probably have to be re-considered.

33
00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:36.194
Dear.

34
00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:40.794
She's slim and her hair is about this long.

35
00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:44.494
I think she was wearing a pink one-piece dress.

36
00:01:44.494 --> 00:01:45.894
I wonder if you mean her?

37
00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:47.394
Have you seen her?

38
00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:50.894
Yes, she went into the windmill shed alone.

39
00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:52.594
About what time was it?

40
00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:56.094
It was just about the time I came back from lunch break.

41
00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:57.694
So, maybe around 1 pm.

42
00:01:57.694 --> 00:01:59.594
About 1 pm.

43
00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:04.194
If in one in a million chances, she was abducted as you say.

44
00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:08.294
Are you saying that the one who took her away is here among us?

45
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.394
I can't say for sure,

46
00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:13.194
but I think the probability is high.

47
00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:16.994
How rude! Do you know what you're talking about?

48
00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:19.594
Calm down, Mochida.

49
00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:22.794
And just what are you planning to do gathering us together like this?

50
00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:28.594
Ms. Akane was seen going into the windmill shed about 1 pm today

51
00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:30.394
by a sales clerk at the cheese store.

52
00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:35.094
So, I'd like to know where you were at around 1 pm.

53
00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:38.094
Checking for the alibi.

54
00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:41.194
I was here adjusting the books.

55
00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:44.794
I was here with my wife all the while.

56
00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:48.994
Around 1 pm, I was horseback riding in Friesian Horse Land.

57
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:53.794
Since the wedding was cancelled, I was drinking at the lounge here.

58
00:02:53.794 --> 00:02:55.094
What about you, Mr. Takahashi?

59
00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:56.894
1 pm?

60
00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:58.694
I think that's just about the time I went to the Glass Museum again

61
00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:01.694
to look at the antique glass.

62
00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:03.694
Just as I thought.

63
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:07.294
-Can I borrow it? -Yes, sure.

64
00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.894
If you want the pictures that are in it,

65
00:03:08.894 --> 00:03:10.994
they'll print it out for you at the front desk.

66
00:03:10.994 --> 00:03:12.894
Okay!

67
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.494
Thank you.

68
00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:18.994
May I ask you something, Mr. Mochida?

69
00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:19.994
What is it?

70
00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:23.194
Is there something special about Ms. Akane's family?

71
00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:27.894
Her father used to be a renowned glass craftsman in Nagasaki,

72
00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:30.294
but passed away 10 years ago.

73
00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:32.894
Anything else?

74
00:03:32.894 --> 00:03:35.294
There are rumors that he committed suicide

75
00:03:35.294 --> 00:03:37.394
because Ohga Bank pressured him

76
00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:39.094
to return the money that we financed him.

77
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.294
Suicide?

78
00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:44.694
The glass workshop that grandma owns in the city used to be his.

79
00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:47.094
Grandma bought the workshop

80
00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.194
that the bank forfeited as collateral.

81
00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:50.594
She wanted the workshop,

82
00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:52.894
so she pressured him to return the money

83
00:03:52.894 --> 00:03:55.094
and got a hold of the workshop.

84
00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:58.194
That is what some people say, but that's wrong.

85
00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:01.094
All we did was carry out a legal transaction.

86
00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:03.594
Well...

87
00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:06.594
Yes. This person came.

88
00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:12.694
He was drinking beer alone right through for about an hour.

89
00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:14.894
Yes, I remember her.

90
00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:17.894
She seemed to have really liked it and rode twice.

91
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:20.594
Oh, I see. Thank you so much.

92
00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:28.194
This isn't the place. It's more to the back.

93
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.094
Here? The long hand fits.

94
00:04:32.094 --> 00:04:34.594
So it's 3:05 pm now.

95
00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:35.594
Wait a second.

96
00:04:35.594 --> 00:04:38.994
Which means that this picture was taken not at 1 pm sharp,

97
00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:40.494
but rather at 2:05 pm.

98
00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:41.694
Since it's a faceless clock,

99
00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:43.394
when the long hand and the shorthand overlaps,

100
00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:45.994
it looks to be 1 pm sharp.

101
00:04:47.094 --> 00:04:48.094
I thought something was wrong.

102
00:04:48.094 --> 00:04:51.294
If the abductor abducted her at the windmill shed at 1 pm,

103
00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:54.194
and is here at 2:05 pm.

104
00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:56.794
Akane is probably confined somewhere

105
00:04:56.794 --> 00:05:01.194
that's not too far away between the windmill shed and the flower clock.

106
00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.494
I've got to find her quick.

107
00:05:08.194 --> 00:05:10.794
You mentioned that you like high places, didn't you?

108
00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:12.194
Right.

109
00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:15.294
-You mean I get to ride that? -Yes.

110
00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:21.294
Gosh. Where is she?

111
00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:32.394
The melody sounds strange.

112
00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:35.394
I get it! Some bells aren't ringing.

113
00:05:36.394 --> 00:05:37.794
Could it be...

114
00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:42.294
Aren't you riding?

115
00:05:42.294 --> 00:05:44.694
No way. I hate high places

116
00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:46.594
and just thinking about it sends chills up my spine.

117
00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:48.594
So go ahead and enjoy yourself.

118
00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:49.894
And you're still so young.

119
00:06:20.794 --> 00:06:22.094
Ms. Akane!

120
00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:25.894
Mr. Takahashi's going to kill Grandma Tae.

121
00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:29.394
Hello.

122
00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:30.594
Conan.

123
00:06:30.594 --> 00:06:33.494
Where's granny? Where's Grandma Tae now?

124
00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:35.594
Grandma is...

125
00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:38.194
She went to ride the balloon with Mr. Takahashi.

126
00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:41.094
Yes, the hot air balloon. Luftballoon.

127
00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:44.894
I feel like a bird.

128
00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.558
That's...

129
00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:21.458
What's that?

130
00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.958
A bomb?

131
00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:28.458
There he is.

132
00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:30.158
We're not going to make it.

133
00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:50.058
What's that?

134
00:07:50.058 --> 00:07:51.758
No! Don't touch it!

135
00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:55.058
It's a triggering device that will set off the bomb set up on the balloon!

136
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.658
That's why don't touch it!

137
00:07:56.658 --> 00:07:58.258
What?

138
00:08:03.258 --> 00:08:08.558
I guess you two saved my life.

139
00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:10.658
I'm so glad, grandma.

140
00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.558
Akane, I'm so glad you're okay.

141
00:08:15.558 --> 00:08:17.258
Shinya, I'm so sorry.

142
00:08:17.258 --> 00:08:19.258
Mr. Takahashi...

143
00:08:19.258 --> 00:08:20.858
Mr. Takahashi?

144
00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:22.958
Akane, did you know him?

145
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:23.958
Yes.

146
00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.558
What is the meaning of this?

147
00:08:25.558 --> 00:08:28.658
What do you mean grandma was in danger?

148
00:08:35.258 --> 00:08:36.958
Sonoko.

149
00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.258
Sonoko!

150
00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:54.258
I'll explain.

151
00:08:54.258 --> 00:08:55.558
What?

152
00:08:55.558 --> 00:08:57.058
Sonoko.

153
00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:59.858
This entire case to begin with,

154
00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:04.258
started with two people with different ideas acting at the same time.

155
00:09:04.258 --> 00:09:07.258
Therefore, it looked as if one person was scheming everything.

156
00:09:07.258 --> 00:09:12.558
Grandma Tae, one of them was you, wasn't it?

157
00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:14.458
What?

158
00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:18.358
Since you were against the marriage between Shinya and Akane.

159
00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:23.358
-Grandmother! -My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

160
00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:25.458
I'll get better after a little rest.

161
00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:31.558
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

162
00:09:31.558 --> 00:09:33.358
How could you do that?

163
00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:34.958
Conan, please bring the thing.

164
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.258
Okay.

165
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:39.858
Ms. Akane, here you go.

166
00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:43.358
You found the ring!

167
00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:44.358
Thank you.

168
00:09:44.358 --> 00:09:46.958
-Conan. -I wonder where it was found?

169
00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.858
You know the fountain by Mauritz Square, don't you?

170
00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:52.258
He seems to have found it there.

171
00:09:53.858 --> 00:09:55.358
Leaving it too close to yourself

172
00:09:55.358 --> 00:09:57.958
would increase the chances of us finding it when we go looking for it.

173
00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:02.158
Since Grandma Tae said so, you hid it at the fountain.

174
00:10:02.158 --> 00:10:03.958
Isn't that right, Ms. Mika?

175
00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.558
Yes, that's right.

176
00:10:05.558 --> 00:10:09.458
Then, what was the picture of the Hydrangea about?

177
00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.858
I was deceived by that, too.

178
00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:14.658
At first because the Hydrangea signifies a change of heart,

179
00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:17.858
I thought it was criticizing Ms. Akane for her change of heart.

180
00:10:17.858 --> 00:10:20.658
But there was another meaning to that picture.

181
00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:22.258
Another meaning?

182
00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:25.958
The water of that fountain flows like that of a waterfall, doesn't it?

183
00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.058
Yes.

184
00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:29.258
The scientific name that was given to the Hydrangea in the beginning

185
00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:31.658
was Hydrangea otakusa,

186
00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:33.658
a name that Siebold had given it.

187
00:10:33.658 --> 00:10:38.258
He called it Otakusa after his wife's name Otaki.

188
00:10:38.258 --> 00:10:41.958
Otakusa. "Otakisan". "Taki" (waterfall), right?

189
00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.858
-That's what it was. -Yes.

190
00:10:43.858 --> 00:10:45.858
Did you know about it?

191
00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:47.058
Yes.

192
00:10:47.058 --> 00:10:50.458
Although that picture looked to be criticizing Ms. Akane,

193
00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:53.758
it was actually indicating where the ring was hidden.

194
00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:55.458
Now you know.

195
00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:57.958
The people who stole the ring are

196
00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.258
grandma and Ms. Mika!

197
00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:06.458
But, Ms. Akane being abducted was a mere coincidence.

198
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:09.858
She felt responsible for losing the ring

199
00:11:09.858 --> 00:11:12.058
and gave up on marrying Shinya.

200
00:11:12.058 --> 00:11:14.858
Then, on her own initiative, she decided to disappear.

201
00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:19.458
What happened after that, Ms. Akane?

202
00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.358
I went out from the waiting room to the back yard,

203
00:11:26.358 --> 00:11:28.858
I coincidentally found Mr. Takahashi

204
00:11:28.858 --> 00:11:31.858
and I secretly followed him.

205
00:11:43.258 --> 00:11:45.458
Mr. Takahashi, what are you doing?

206
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:48.358
I'm going to give it to that old lady.

207
00:11:48.358 --> 00:11:50.758
Have you forgotten?

208
00:11:50.758 --> 00:11:55.058
Your father passed away all because of that old lady.

209
00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:58.458
The one who stole the ring is that woman called Mika, you know.

210
00:11:58.458 --> 00:11:59.458
No way.

211
00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:02.058
Of course, the old lady told her to do so, though.

212
00:12:02.058 --> 00:12:05.458
Please let me go through with what I've planned.

213
00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.358
And, till Conan came to save me,

214
00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:11.258
I was locked up in Carillon Symphonica.

215
00:12:11.258 --> 00:12:13.158
Then he...

216
00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:15.458
Yes, he's the one who had been chosen as Ms. Akane's groom in the past

217
00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:17.158
that Grandma Teo was talking about.

218
00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:18.458
What?

219
00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:20.558
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

220
00:12:20.558 --> 00:12:24.658
When I saw Mr. Takahashi yesterday with Sonoko and the others,

221
00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:26.658
I was really surprised

222
00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:28.358
because it's been 10 years since I last saw him.

223
00:12:28.358 --> 00:12:31.858
Ms. Akane, you saw Mr. Takahashi last night, didn't you?

224
00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:35.258
Yes, I asked him why he came.

225
00:12:35.258 --> 00:12:41.258
He answered that he came to watch my wedding from afar.

226
00:12:41.258 --> 00:12:43.358
But, I was worried whether he was really telling me the truth

227
00:12:43.358 --> 00:12:45.258
and if that was all there was to it.

228
00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:48.558
Mr. Takahashi, isn't it about time you got up?

229
00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:51.158
Just how long do you intend to stay sleeping there?

230
00:12:54.058 --> 00:12:55.958
Since when did you realize what was going on?

231
00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.558
I thought something was strange to begin with,

232
00:12:58.558 --> 00:13:00.858
because although you said you were from Hotaru,

233
00:13:00.858 --> 00:13:03.258
when you saw Ms. Akane in her wedding dress,

234
00:13:03.258 --> 00:13:07.258
you spoke in the Nigasaki dialect and said she was beautiful.

235
00:13:07.258 --> 00:13:09.658
You're the one who tampered with the brakes of grandma's car

236
00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.758
as well as dropped the rock from above the stone wall, right?

237
00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:14.258
Yes, that's right.

238
00:13:14.258 --> 00:13:19.458
Ms. Akane's father was killed by this old lady!

239
00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:22.458
Mister was suddenly pressured to return the money

240
00:13:22.458 --> 00:13:23.758
that Ohga Bank had loaned him,

241
00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:25.758
and committed suicide out of desperation.

242
00:13:26.758 --> 00:13:30.758
I've never forgotten the miserable sight of her father, not even once.

243
00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:34.058
Mister!

244
00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:37.358
Mister, why'd you do this?

245
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.658
How could you leave Akane all alone?

246
00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:43.458
This all happened just because

247
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:46.858
the old lady wanted a glass workshop for her pastime.

248
00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:48.158
Just before all this happened,

249
00:13:48.158 --> 00:13:51.058
we were gradually losing orders from our big dealers.

250
00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:55.158
I went to ask a wholesaler in Hotaru where mister had transactions with,

251
00:13:55.158 --> 00:13:57.058
if he knew what was going on.

252
00:13:57.058 --> 00:14:00.158
He finally admitted that he was reducing order to us

253
00:14:00.158 --> 00:14:02.058
because he was concerned about Ohga Bank.

254
00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:03.658
Wrong!

255
00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:07.258
Father.

256
00:14:07.258 --> 00:14:10.258
My mother liked Mr. Katori's glassworks.

257
00:14:10.258 --> 00:14:12.858
So, wanting him to somehow continue,

258
00:14:12.858 --> 00:14:15.658
she even gave him advice on how to manage the workshop.

259
00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:16.658
What?

260
00:14:16.658 --> 00:14:19.058
However, Mr. Katori who was a craftsman through

261
00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:20.958
and through refused to lend an ear.

262
00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.358
He insisted saying, "My glasswork is only for those

263
00:14:24.358 --> 00:14:26.058
who see the value in them".

264
00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:28.358
He kept making fantastic glassworks spending time,

265
00:14:28.358 --> 00:14:30.658
putting his all into them.

266
00:14:30.658 --> 00:14:32.258
Of course his works were expensive

267
00:14:32.258 --> 00:14:35.258
but they were indeed masterpieces.

268
00:14:35.258 --> 00:14:37.358
However, they didn't make out

269
00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:39.458
and he went more and more into the reds.

270
00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:40.958
As a result...

271
00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.058
As a result, he started delaying payments for the loan he had with us.

272
00:14:44.058 --> 00:14:45.458
First, he delayed 3 days, a week,

273
00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:49.358
then two weeks and so on forth.

274
00:14:49.358 --> 00:14:51.558
We're not all that big a bank either,

275
00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:52.558
so we couldn't afford this to go on forever.

276
00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:53.658
That's a lie!

277
00:14:53.658 --> 00:14:55.158
It's not a lie.

278
00:14:55.158 --> 00:14:56.858
It's a lie.

279
00:14:56.858 --> 00:14:59.358
It's not a lie, Mr. Takahashi.

280
00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:01.958
It's a lie!

281
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.858
Mister isn't such a weak person.

282
00:15:04.858 --> 00:15:07.458
He used to sweat from early morning to late at night

283
00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:12.358
teaching me, who knew nothing, from A to Z.

284
00:15:12.358 --> 00:15:16.258
Grandma, you were against Ms. Akane getting married

285
00:15:16.258 --> 00:15:18.258
because you blamed yourself for not being thoughtful enough

286
00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:21.458
and driving to Ms. Akane's father suicidal, right?

287
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:25.058
That's why it really hurt for you to look at Ms. Akane, right?

288
00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.258
Grandma.

289
00:15:28.258 --> 00:15:30.658
So, since Ms. Akane found out

290
00:15:30.658 --> 00:15:33.458
that Mr. Takahashi was attempting to kill grandma,

291
00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:36.258
she was locked up.

292
00:15:36.258 --> 00:15:39.458
I know it's not something that can be forgiven.

293
00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:43.958
But please forgive Mr. Takahashi.

294
00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.158
Akane.

295
00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:47.258
Grandma.

296
00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:48.758
Please, I beg you.

297
00:15:48.758 --> 00:15:50.258
-Grandma. -Chairwoman!

298
00:15:50.258 --> 00:15:53.658
Mochida, about playing the role of the father of the bride,

299
00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:54.958
although he's quite young yet,

300
00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.258
why don't we have Mr. Takahashi do it?

301
00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:01.258
Of course, I totally agree.

302
00:16:01.258 --> 00:16:02.658
Grandma.

303
00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:06.058
Then, you're approving of them getting married?

304
00:16:06.058 --> 00:16:08.858
The ring was found, so most naturally.

305
00:16:08.858 --> 00:16:10.658
Oh, I'm glad!

306
00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:13.458
Grandma had intended things to turn out this way, to begin with.

307
00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:14.458
What?

308
00:16:14.458 --> 00:16:15.958
She was intending to approve of their marriage

309
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.858
when the ring was found.

310
00:16:18.858 --> 00:16:21.558
How do you know?

311
00:16:21.558 --> 00:16:25.958
The sculpture of that fountain is Aphrodite and Psyche.

312
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:31.158
Aphrodite jealous of Psyche who had fallen in love with her son, Eros,

313
00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:34.058
gives Psyche many trials to accomplish.

314
00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:36.358
However, she finally approves both to see through their love

315
00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:40.258
after Psyche accomplishes everything that was dished out to her.

316
00:16:40.258 --> 00:16:44.358
That fountain describes this final scene.

317
00:16:44.358 --> 00:16:46.958
Grandma knew of this Greek mythology

318
00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.758
and had the ring hidden there.

319
00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:51.658
She even deliberately left the picture of the Hydrangeas behind as a hint,

320
00:16:51.658 --> 00:16:55.058
pointing to "Taki", Siebold's wife,

321
00:16:55.058 --> 00:16:57.258
isn't that right, grandma?

322
00:16:58.258 --> 00:17:02.758
It' so full of western letters that I have no idea what it's about.

323
00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:05.258
-Oh, my. -Just as expected of you, grandma.

324
00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.858
When things get inconvenient for you, you try to brush it off.

325
00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:29.358
I do.

326
00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:31.558
Do you promise

327
00:17:31.558 --> 00:17:33.358
to love him?

328
00:17:33.358 --> 00:17:35.058
I do.

329
00:18:31.258 --> 00:18:34.758
I'm supposed to get married to Mr. Kyogoku!

330
00:18:36.158 --> 00:18:38.158
Sonoko.

331
00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:40.858
Ran took it!

332
00:18:40.858 --> 00:18:43.658
Not my fault.

333
00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:46.558
"Next Episode" -It's because

334
00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:48.058
there have been

335
00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:50.558
a lot of weird people around us lately.

336
00:18:51.558 --> 00:18:54.358
I have a feeling that something bad might happen soon.

337
00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:57.558
What? That brat ran away from home?

338
00:18:57.558 --> 00:18:59.258
How sassy, the next time I see him, I'll...

339
00:18:59.258 --> 00:19:01.658
No, he went to take care of Ai who's sick in bed.

340
00:19:01.658 --> 00:19:02.758
What?

341
00:19:04.558 --> 00:19:06.358
Shinichi.

342
00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:08.958
Ran?

343
00:19:09.558 --> 00:19:10.858
Next Conan,

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:14.858
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 1)"

345
00:19:15.885 --> 00:19:18.085
Next Conan's Hint:
