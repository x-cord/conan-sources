1
00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.424
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.324
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:06.224
A Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament in Kumamoto.

4
00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.024
A cellphone's text message causes big trouble for Ran.

5
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:13.724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:01.011
"Mount Aso"

9
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.611
We are on board our plane flying to Kumamoto.

10
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:11.311
We headed there to enter a tennis match

11
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.311
that Genta won in a lottery.

12
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.411
Ran and Pops is with us as our guardian

13
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:20.111
and Sonoko has also come along paying her own way.

14
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:23.611
Just as would be expected of the daughter of the Suzuki financial group.

15
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:26.111
And, this time there is one more person who came along with us.

16
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.111
It's not usual for her to come along on something like this.

17
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:31.111
Want anything?

18
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:32.511
Oh, well, no.

19
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.911
Okay.

20
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:38.411
Usually you're not interested in these stuff and didn't join us,

21
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:41.311
so I was wondering why you tag along this time.

22
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.911
There's no special reason why I came along.

23
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:49.111
It's because Dr. Agasa kept bugging me to go.

24
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:50.311
And besides...

25
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:54.211
Unless I stay near you, you can't protect me, can you?

26
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:57.711
Only joking.

27
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.011
Oh boy.

28
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:07.311
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 1)"

29
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:10.311
"Kumamoto Airport"

30
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:18.711
"The First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament"

31
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.911
Here we are.

32
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:22.411
It's Kyushu!

33
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.111
It's Kumamoto!

34
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:25.811
Shochu liquor!

35
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.111
Just as expected of your dad, Ran.

36
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:36.711
Come on, dad.

37
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:40.011
Let's hurry and rent a car and go to the hotel.

38
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.011
Hey.

39
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:42.811
-Hold it. -We bring to you

40
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:44.011
the Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament.

41
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:46.911
Playing the semi-finals will be,

42
00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:48.111
-First match, -It's Kyohei Mabuchi.

43
00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:51.511
-Kyohei Mabuchi a local of Kumamoto... -You're right.

44
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:53.911
-vs. America's Richard Woodbridge. -Awesome.

45
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:55.811
-The match will start from 11:00 am. -You're still kids.

46
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.011
-The second match will be played... -The one who's really awesome is...

47
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.311
by Masato Tachikawa, also a local of Kumamoto

48
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.811
-vs. Michael Owen of England, -Masahito!

49
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.411
which will begin at 2:00 pm.

50
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:12.411
We could never beat him, though.

51
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:15.311
Come on, Genta.

52
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.111
We're entering the junior match,

53
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:20.911
but they'reall professionals.

54
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:24.811
We would never end up playing those people.

55
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:26.111
Oh, really?

56
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.811
Right, Genta.

57
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:30.111
What a bummer.

58
00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:32.611
I was kind of hoping to play against them.

59
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.111
"Ninomaru Park"

60
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:53.611
It so spacious and feels good.

61
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:55.311
Yeah.

62
00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:58.311
Kids sure are active no matter what they do.

63
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:02.011
Really, training as soon as they get here.

64
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.311
It's so nice to be young.

65
00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:07.311
You're talking like you're some middle-aged woman or something.

66
00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:08.711
What are you doing, Genta?

67
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.711
I'm...

68
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:16.811
Let's rest a while.

69
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.411
Just what are you talking about?

70
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:20.411
The match is tomorrow.

71
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:24.011
We've come to Kumamoto to win.

72
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:28.511
But, where's Mr. Mouri?

73
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.811
You're right, Ai's not around either.

74
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.311
Well, I do have an idea where they are, though.

75
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.911
Spicy lotus root, raw horse meat and shochu liquor.

76
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:44.911
Viva Kumamoto.

77
00:05:59.311 --> 00:06:00.711
I can't take it anymore.

78
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:06.211
Let's take a five minute break, then.

79
00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:08.811
Only five minutes?

80
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.911
-Are you serious? -Of course.

81
00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:16.011
Mitsuhiko, why don't we call it a day for training

82
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.711
and go look around since we've come all the way to Kumamoto.

83
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:21.811
Agreed. Agreed.

84
00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:23.811
I'm starving too.

85
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:27.711
Hey, Mitsuhiko?

86
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.311
Besides, we don't want anybody to overwork themselves

87
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:31.911
and get hurt or something just before the match, do we?

88
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.511
But, Ran...

89
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:37.311
I know how you feel about wanting to win,

90
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:40.011
but participating in the game is what counts.

91
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:41.511
Have you ever heard this phrase?

92
00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:45.811
I think it's more important to give it all we've got

93
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.611
and to try our best,

94
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:50.911
rather than we win the game or not.

95
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:55.211
Okay.

96
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:58.011
All right! Let's go eat eels over rice.

97
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.511
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:02.911
Pork bones noodle is what Kumamoto is famous for.

99
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:06.311
Ran.

100
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.811
You'll become a good mother.

101
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.411
"The Kumamoto Castle"

102
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:39.111
"Suizenji Park"

103
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.311
What is it, Sonoko?

104
00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:52.411
Look what I found.

105
00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.911
Isn't that a cell phone?

106
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:55.911
We've got to turn it into the police right away.

107
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:56.911
Yeah.

108
00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.411
It's vibrating.

109
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:01.411
Mail?

110
00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:03.411
Yeah, I think so.

111
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:06.011
Shall we take a look at it?

112
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:08.511
No, we shouldn't peek into other people's mail.

113
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:10.011
Who cares?

114
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.311
Besides, it may be from the owner of this cell phone, right?

115
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:14.311
Hey, don't.

116
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:19.311
It says, "Sonoko. I want to see you."

117
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:21.311
It's a love mail.

118
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:23.311
You're blushed.

119
00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:25.911
Hey, what's up, Sonoko?

120
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:27.011
Well...

121
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:29.111
It's nothing, really.

122
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:31.611
This is not kid's stuff.

123
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.611
You better watch out,

124
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:35.711
the police may scold you for looking at other people's mail.

125
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.911
Never mind. The other kids are waiting for you over there.

126
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:40.111
Hurry and go on over there.

127
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:46.111
At any rate, we've got to hurry and take it to the police.

128
00:08:46.111 --> 00:08:47.811
What're you talking about?

129
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:51.811
We're going to deliver this in person tomorrow

130
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:53.411
to the person who sent this mail.

131
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.011
But, we've got the tennis match tomorrow.

132
00:08:57.011 --> 00:08:58.211
Don't worry.

133
00:08:58.211 --> 00:09:01.111
See, this Prefectural Athletic Park

134
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.211
is where the the tennis match is going to be held.

135
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:05.311
Oh, right.

136
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.311
See?

137
00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:09.911
So, it won't hurt to leave for just a while.

138
00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:11.511
I guess so.

139
00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:15.011
That's it. Tomorrow we'll see how this love

140
00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:17.011
as well as the tennis match goes.

141
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:29.711
Finally, tomorrow is the day.

142
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:31.211
Are going to be okay?

143
00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:33.811
Yeah, of course.

144
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:35.511
I give you my word.

145
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:43.411
We will now begin

146
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:49.311
the First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament Junior Match.

147
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:51.011
Before the start of the game,

148
00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:54.311
I, Kenzo Narimasu, Chairman of this tournament

149
00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:56.111
would like to give a welcome speech

150
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:58.611
"Kenzo Narimasu (60)" -to the guardians of the contestants

151
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:01.211
"Congressman" -as well as all the spectators here.

152
00:10:01.211 --> 00:10:04.411
I am being suspected at present

153
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:08.711
for something that I have no knowledge of whatsoever, but...

154
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:10.011
I swear to God that i am innocent...

155
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:11.911
-of all such dubious acts. -What's with that man?

156
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:15.411
He's talking about something irrelevant to tennis.

157
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:19.211
He looks awfully familiar, though.

158
00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:21.311
You probably some him on TV.

159
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:22.811
He's Kenzo Narimasu,

160
00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:24.711
a congressman who was elected

161
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.211
from Kumamoto that has recently been talked about a lot

162
00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:28.811
regarding his corrupted acts.

163
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:31.111
Oh, yes, I've heard of him.

164
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:33.711
The other day, his secretary called Saiki took on all the guilt

165
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:35.811
and committed suicide, right?

166
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:37.011
Yeah.

167
00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.911
So, in order to gain back his reputation with the public,

168
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:43.011
he offered to be sponsor for this tournament.

169
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:44.811
The usual stuff.

171
00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:07.011

172
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:11.811

173
00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:16.611
"Takumi Club 0 vs The Youth Detective Squad 2"

174
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:18.211
We did it.

175
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:20.611
Really, I don't believe it.

176
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:22.911
Great victory for the Youth Detective Squad.

177
00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:25.511
Good work and welcome back everybody.

178
00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:27.011
Were you watching us, Ai?

179
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:29.411
Yes, you're all pretty good.

180
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.411
Now, we get to go on to the semi-finals.

181
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:32.911
We've already come this far.

182
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.111
Victory of the Youth Detective Squad!

183
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:41.711
Hey, where are Ran and Sonoko?

184
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:46.211
I wonder they went sneaking off just a while ago.

185
00:11:46.211 --> 00:11:47.411
I see.

186
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.011
"Cafe Athlete"

187
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:55.111
There's nobody who looks to be the owner.

188
00:11:55.111 --> 00:11:56.511
Nope.

189
00:11:56.511 --> 00:11:58.011
Should we mail him?

190
00:11:58.011 --> 00:11:59.911
Don't, Sonoko.

191
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:02.811
Just joking, only joking.

192
00:12:02.811 --> 00:12:05.311
But, this is so exciting.

193
00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:09.011
I think I kind of got too nervous

194
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.111
that I have to go to the ladies' room.

195
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:13.611
Sorry, Ran, I'll be right back.

196
00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:20.011
Geez.

197
00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:22.011
Sonoko sure is late.

198
00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:26.111
Yeah, she wasn't for it to begin with so...

199
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:30.211
That's why we decided to meet and talk it out, right?

200
00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:33.811
Yeah, but if Sonoko doesn't come...

201
00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:37.611
If so, we wait outside until she succeeds

202
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:39.511
and run for it together.

203
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:43.411
After all, today's the only chance we got to kill that guy.

204
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.811
What shall I do? I've got to get somebody, quick.

205
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:58.111
Cell phone, cell phone. Where's my cell phone?

206
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:03.011
You heard us talking, didn't you?

207
00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:07.111
"Akira Doi, Hideki Mamiya" -Hey, isn't that Sonoko's cell phone?

208
00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.011
No doubt about it. It's Sonoko's.

209
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:14.311
How come you have it?

210
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:17.311
My friend picked it up so, I was going to return it...

211
00:13:17.311 --> 00:13:19.911
You mean Sonoko dropped it?

212
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:23.311
Which means maybe she didn't read our mail.

213
00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:27.011
Either way, we can't let you go, like this.

214
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.411
What the heck? So, you finally made it?

215
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:37.211
What should we do with this girl?

216
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:38.611
Just like Akira says,

217
00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:40.811
we can't let her go as is.

218
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:42.911
Let's take her to the factory for now.

219
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.811
Yeah, I guess so.

220
00:13:54.762 --> 00:13:58.762
What? Ran... Ran is gone?

221
00:13:58.762 --> 00:14:02.762
Right, she disappeared while I was in the lady's room.

222
00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:05.562
Are you sure she's not back at the hotel room sleeping?

223
00:14:05.562 --> 00:14:07.762
I called and asked,

224
00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:10.062
but was told she hasn't come back yet.

225
00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:12.062
I wonder what happened.

226
00:14:12.062 --> 00:14:14.062
That's cause for worry.

227
00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.062
Hey, did you try calling her cell phone? Ran's cell phone?

228
00:14:17.062 --> 00:14:20.662
Yes, but no one answered.

229
00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:22.762
I wonder if she has it on manner mode

230
00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:25.662
and doesn't know it's ringing. Or, it could be that...

231
00:14:25.662 --> 00:14:27.062
Or, it could be that...

232
00:14:27.062 --> 00:14:29.462
she's in a situation that she can't answer.

233
00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:35.062
But, I can't tell if it's an accident or an incident.

234
00:14:44.662 --> 00:14:46.362
Where is this?

235
00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:50.762
Why am I here?

236
00:14:53.562 --> 00:14:56.062
You heard us talking, didn't you?

237
00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.862
Hey, isn't that Sonoko's cell phone?

238
00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:01.462
No doubt about it. It's Sonoko's.

239
00:15:01.462 --> 00:15:03.462
How come you have it?

240
00:15:03.462 --> 00:15:07.062
You mean Sonoko dropped it?

241
00:15:08.162 --> 00:15:09.862
Maybe I...

242
00:15:11.362 --> 00:15:14.562
Don't tell she was kidnapped?

243
00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:15.762
It can't be?

244
00:15:15.762 --> 00:15:18.162
Hey, you guys.

245
00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:20.762
What's with that bummed out look on your faces?

246
00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:23.162
I get it, you guys lost?

247
00:15:23.162 --> 00:15:25.662
No, it's not that.

248
00:15:25.662 --> 00:15:27.162
Ran...

249
00:15:27.162 --> 00:15:29.762
May have been kidnapped.

250
00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.862
What?

251
00:15:37.262 --> 00:15:39.062
There.

252
00:15:39.062 --> 00:15:40.762
Hey, hold it.

253
00:15:40.762 --> 00:15:43.362
Are you sure about this kidnap thing?

254
00:15:43.362 --> 00:15:46.862
Maybe she's lost somewhere near here?

255
00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:49.762
But, she's not answering her cell phone.

256
00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:51.462
She's not back at the hotel either.

257
00:15:51.462 --> 00:15:54.262
But that's not enough to go on...

258
00:15:58.762 --> 00:15:59.862
It's from Ran.

259
00:15:59.862 --> 00:16:03.362
See, how dare you worry me like that.

260
00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:07.462
Hello. Ran, just where the heck are you now?

261
00:16:07.462 --> 00:16:09.162
Sorry, Sonoko.

262
00:16:09.162 --> 00:16:11.862
It's seems as if I've been kidnapped.

263
00:16:11.862 --> 00:16:13.562
You've been kidnapped after all?

264
00:16:13.562 --> 00:16:15.462
-What? -Lend it to me.

265
00:16:16.462 --> 00:16:18.862
Hello, Ran.

266
00:16:18.862 --> 00:16:20.062
Conan.

267
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.762
Do you know where you are?

268
00:16:21.762 --> 00:16:23.262
Where?

269
00:16:23.262 --> 00:16:27.462
It seems to be the locker room of an abandoned factory or something.

270
00:16:27.462 --> 00:16:29.862
Can you look out the window?

271
00:16:29.862 --> 00:16:32.762
Is there anythin that can serve as a hint to where you are?

272
00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:34.262
Anything will do.

273
00:16:34.262 --> 00:16:36.062
Okay, hold on.

274
00:16:40.862 --> 00:16:42.662
How about it, Ran?

275
00:16:42.662 --> 00:16:43.962
Sunflower.

276
00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.462
Right, there are a lot of sunflowers in bloom here.

277
00:16:47.462 --> 00:16:48.562
Anything else?

278
00:16:48.562 --> 00:16:49.962
On the other side of the sunflowers

279
00:16:49.962 --> 00:16:52.162
there is a building that is not in use.

280
00:16:52.162 --> 00:16:53.562
There is a sign.

281
00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:56.062
What's written on the sign?

282
00:16:56.062 --> 00:16:57.662
Wait...

283
00:17:00.662 --> 00:17:03.262
Hirukomachi.

284
00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:05.562
Hirukomachi is what's written.

285
00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:08.162
It's written with "bloodsucker" and "child" characters.

286
00:17:08.162 --> 00:17:10.662
Okay. Hirukomachi, right?

287
00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:13.262
And about the kidnappers?

288
00:17:13.262 --> 00:17:17.262
The kidnappers are the ones who sent the mail to Sonoko.

289
00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:20.262
The ones who mailed Sonoko?

290
00:17:21.362 --> 00:17:23.562
Conan, please listen to me.

291
00:17:23.562 --> 00:17:27.762
Those people were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

292
00:17:27.762 --> 00:17:29.662
Hey, Ran. It's me.

293
00:17:29.662 --> 00:17:30.962
Can you hear me?

294
00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:34.362
Hey! Answer me, Ran!

295
00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:39.662
The line's been cut.

296
00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:42.062
Maybe the kidnappers found her talking on the phone?

297
00:17:45.962 --> 00:17:47.162
What shall we do?

298
00:17:47.162 --> 00:17:49.862
She could've contacted the police.

299
00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:52.062
Maybe we should drop the whole idea after all.

300
00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:54.862
No, we won't let anybody get in our way.

301
00:17:54.862 --> 00:17:56.362
Not anybody.

302
00:18:12.362 --> 00:18:14.262
Thank you for waiting.

303
00:18:14.262 --> 00:18:17.962
I am Officer Tamana from the Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department.

304
00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:19.862
This is Officer Kato.

305
00:18:19.862 --> 00:18:20.962
Hello.

306
00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:26.162
How do you do? I'm Kogoro Mouri.

307
00:18:26.162 --> 00:18:28.362
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

308
00:18:28.362 --> 00:18:29.962
Well, please sit down.

309
00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:30.962
Thank you.

310
00:18:34.062 --> 00:18:36.262
I'm sure you're very worried,

311
00:18:36.262 --> 00:18:37.562
because I was contacted by Inspector Megure

312
00:18:37.562 --> 00:18:40.562
telling me to handle the situation with great care.

313
00:18:40.562 --> 00:18:44.062
Please do let us handle this case completely.

314
00:18:44.062 --> 00:18:45.462
Yes, but...

315
00:18:45.462 --> 00:18:47.062
Mr. Mouri,

316
00:18:47.062 --> 00:18:49.262
I understand how you feel,

317
00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:51.462
but I don't think that you are in a situation

318
00:18:51.462 --> 00:18:53.462
to judge things objectively right now.

319
00:18:53.462 --> 00:18:56.562
This case involves the life of your daughter,

320
00:18:56.562 --> 00:18:58.862
so please bear with us for now and let us handle this.

321
00:18:58.862 --> 00:19:00.762
All right.

322
00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:02.362
I appreciate it.

323
00:19:02.362 --> 00:19:05.662
Now, as to the current situation...

324
00:19:05.662 --> 00:19:07.262
Yes, sir.

325
00:19:08.862 --> 00:19:12.062
As a result of our inquiries within this athletic park,

326
00:19:12.062 --> 00:19:19.162
the said woman victim seems to have been carried away by two men.

327
00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:20.462
That's it.

328
00:19:20.462 --> 00:19:26.662
About the Hirukomachi that the victim had mentioned over the phone,

329
00:19:26.662 --> 00:19:29.362
such a town does not exist.

330
00:19:29.362 --> 00:19:31.962
-What? -Are you serious?

331
00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.862
What the heck is going on?

332
00:19:38.362 --> 00:19:40.762
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.

333
00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:45.262
If I didn't pick up that cell phone...

334
00:19:45.262 --> 00:19:48.462
Don't worry about it, you're not to blame.

335
00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:50.762
The kidnappers are the villains.

336
00:19:53.862 --> 00:19:56.662
This is no time to be playing tennis, is it?

337
00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:57.662
Sure isn't.

338
00:19:57.662 --> 00:20:00.962
We've got to give up the tennis match.

339
00:20:00.962 --> 00:20:04.162
Yeah. I am worried about Ran.

340
00:20:05.862 --> 00:20:07.762
I don't think so.

341
00:20:08.762 --> 00:20:10.662
Like Ran was saying,

342
00:20:10.662 --> 00:20:13.562
the whole point is to participate in the game.

343
00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:17.562
She was for us through and through.

344
00:20:17.562 --> 00:20:21.262
We can't give up the game now.

345
00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.562
Of course I'm worried about Ran too.

346
00:20:24.562 --> 00:20:28.462
But, there's nothing we can do by staying here either.

347
00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:32.762
I think it's way better to show Ran our victory trophy

348
00:20:32.762 --> 00:20:35.762
when she comes back and make her happy.

349
00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:36.962
Yeah, but...

350
00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:38.162
He's right.

351
00:20:39.262 --> 00:20:40.862
Just like Mitsuhiko says,

352
00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:43.762
we can't do anything here anyway.

353
00:20:43.762 --> 00:20:45.262
Let's participate in the game.

354
00:20:45.262 --> 00:20:46.662
Right, Pops?

355
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.962
Huh? Yeah, right.

356
00:20:48.962 --> 00:20:51.262
The police is working on the case

357
00:20:51.262 --> 00:20:53.662
and you guys made it to the finals, right?

358
00:20:53.662 --> 00:20:55.262
If so, go for it.

359
00:20:55.262 --> 00:20:57.062
Okay, we'll do our best.

360
00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:01.062
We've already come this far. Then, let's give it our best shot.

361
00:21:01.062 --> 00:21:03.862
-Okay. -Okay, then let's all do our best

362
00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.462
and show Ran the champion trophy.

363
00:21:05.462 --> 00:21:07.062
-Aye! -Aye...

364
00:21:08.662 --> 00:21:09.862
Hey, Shinichi.

365
00:21:09.862 --> 00:21:13.162
I'll bet you have no intention of participating in the game, do you?

366
00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:16.662
You're planning to go search for her alone, aren't you?

367
00:21:16.662 --> 00:21:21.662
Yeah, although I feel bad for those kids.

368
00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:23.462
You're really something.

369
00:21:27.762 --> 00:21:29.762
If you will excuse me...

370
00:21:29.762 --> 00:21:32.662
Hello, this is Tamana.

371
00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:33.862
What?

372
00:21:33.862 --> 00:21:35.562
And?

373
00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:36.562
Yeah.

374
00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:38.662
Yeah.

375
00:21:39.762 --> 00:21:41.762
Okay, do that, will you?

376
00:21:42.762 --> 00:21:46.162
What's up? Don't tell me something happened to Ran...

377
00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:48.962
No, the kidnappers seem to have called the station directly

378
00:21:48.962 --> 00:21:52.262
demanding ransom, just now.

379
00:21:52.262 --> 00:21:53.262
What?

380
00:21:54.662 --> 00:21:58.062
An officer is on his way here

381
00:21:58.062 --> 00:21:59.662
with the recording of the phone conversation.

382
00:21:59.662 --> 00:22:02.462
Darn those guys, how dare they do this to Ran?

383
00:22:02.462 --> 00:22:04.062
They're not going to get away with this!

384
00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:07.662
What the heck's going on?

385
00:22:07.662 --> 00:22:11.362
Why would they call the police directly for ransom?

386
00:22:11.362 --> 00:22:15.162
Maybe this is no usual kidnapping.

387
00:22:15.162 --> 00:22:17.962
If so, what are they actually after?

388
00:22:19.062 --> 00:22:22.162
The last words of Ran's call was...

389
00:22:23.262 --> 00:22:27.162
They were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

390
00:22:27.162 --> 00:22:29.662
They're going to kill somebody today?

391
00:22:31.262 --> 00:22:33.662
Maybe Ran?

392
00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:08.162
"Next Episode" -Fifty million yen is totally impossible.

393
00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:09.562
Mr. Mouri.

394
00:24:09.562 --> 00:24:11.962
You don't seem to like the idea.

395
00:24:11.962 --> 00:24:13.162
Ai.

396
00:24:13.162 --> 00:24:16.762
You're thinking that it's not just a plain kidnapping case, right?

397
00:24:16.762 --> 00:24:17.962
Right.

398
00:24:17.962 --> 00:24:21.562
Bad news. Conan is nowhere in sight.

399
00:24:21.562 --> 00:24:24.362
-What? -Come to think of it, neither is Ai.

400
00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:25.662
Ai too?

401
00:24:25.662 --> 00:24:28.662
Maybe they both went to look for Ran.

402
00:24:30.162 --> 00:24:31.562
Next Conan,

403
00:24:31.562 --> 00:24:35.762
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 2)"

404
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:38.589
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:38.589 --> 00:24:40.689
"Awards ceremony"

406
00:24:40.689 --> 00:24:41.889
Next time, we are going to save Ran.

407
00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:43.589
Sonoko, I know who the perpetrator are.

408
00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:46.289
Of course, because they are right beside you, aren't they?
