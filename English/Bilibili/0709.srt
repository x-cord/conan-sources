1
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:08,724
I didn't think that it wouldn't be around anymore.

2
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:11,024
I hear they're going to build a condominium.

3
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,624
Too bad, because it was a delicious diner.

4
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,524
Too bad.

5
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:17,924
Well, let's go, then.

6
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:19,024
Come to think of it,

7
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:22,224
there are a lot of new buildings being constructed around here.

8
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:23,924
Over there, too.

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,824
Yes, that used to be a sweet dumplings shop.

10
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,024
Over there, too.

11
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:30,724
There used to be an old apartment there.

12
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:31,924
There, too.

13
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:34,424
That used to be a bookstore, I think.

14
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:35,824
Over here, too.

15
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:37,824
Take a good look. They're renovating the place.

16
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:41,224
Over here, too.

17
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,624
What about here?

18
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,924
This was an old public bath house.

19
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:47,224
I came here a few times, too.

20
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:50,824
It looks like this place is going to be a facility for bathing.

21
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,224
Gosh.

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,924
If so, they should've just left it as is a bath house.

23
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,624
You can say that again.

24
00:00:56,624 --> 00:01:00,024
I guess that's what they call business.

25
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,224
But it's sort of sad to think that

26
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:03,924
things from the past are disappearing.

27
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:05,324
I guess so.

28
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,024
What's the matter?

29
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:22,424
Somebody, call an ambulance!

30
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,724
-Ran, get an ambulance! -Yes, sir.

31
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:26,824
Mr. Inomata's not here.

32
00:01:26,824 --> 00:01:30,524
He was in the smoking room a while ago, so maybe...

33
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,524
Darn it.

34
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,324
Mr. Murase, hurry up!

35
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,824
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,324
Aiming for a 100% solution.

37
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:52,524
Clear all mysteries and codes.

38
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:54,324
Shocking sound at a construction site!

39
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:56,224
An awesome deadly trick is schemed.

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:01:57,824 --> 00:01:59,924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:02,324
His name is Detective Conan!

43
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:52,588
"Unidentified Impact"

44
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:55,388
Okay, give me an outline of this case.

45
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:56,488
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,488
At about noon today, there was an accident

47
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,788
in which the pipes that are used as footings collapsed.

48
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:05,888
The victim is Mr. Yuji Inomata, age 56.

49
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,388
He seems to be the owner of this site.

50
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:10,988
The cause of death is bruises all over his body

51
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,388
due to being buried under collapsed pipes.

52
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,088
They say that it is most likely that he died instantly.

53
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,288
Inspector.

54
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,988
There was a trace on the band bunching the pipes together.

55
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,388
Someone deliberately making a slit on it.

56
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:22,788
I think would be reasonable to say that

57
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:26,988
this is a homicide rather than an accident.

58
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:30,688
But I wonder why Mr. Inomata was there?

59
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,688
There was an ashtray under the pipes that were collapsed.

60
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:36,588
Maybe it was the smoking area or something?

61
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,388
The smoking area?

62
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,688
I see.

63
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:41,988
Come to think of it, there were cigarette butts

64
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,588
found at the feet of the victim.

65
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,888
Mr. Inomata was a heavy smoker.

66
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,988
Anytime he had time, he'd go to take a puff.

67
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:54,288
They are people who were at the scene when the accident occurred.

68
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,788
They're all personnel of this construction site.

69
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:01,188
He's Mr. Inomata's chauffeur, Mr. Masao Kaneda.

70
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:05,988
He's Mr. Takeshi Nojima, the construction director of this site.

71
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,988
And he's Mr. Naoki Murase, an architect.

72
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:11,488
He seems to be in charge of designing this place.

73
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:15,488
Will you tell me your circumstances just before the accident?

74
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:17,688
Back then, I was told by Mr. Inomata

75
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:20,788
to go buy coffee or something for the guest.

76
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,688
I went to the vending machine behind the site to buy coffee.

77
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:28,388
When I got back, the pipes were collapsed.

78
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:31,188
Who was that guest?

79
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:33,088
It's me.

80
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:36,288
I came to talk out about details.

81
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,288
Details?

82
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:40,488
Rather, I came to discuss

83
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,888
the concept of the setting of this place.

84
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:45,488
And while Mr. Kaneda was out buying coffee,

85
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:48,488
I decided to call my office.

86
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:49,588
During that time,

87
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,788
Mr. Inomata left for the smoking area to take a puff.

88
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,688
After a while, I heard a loud noise.

89
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,088
I looked towards the smoking area...

90
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:00,588
I was on lunch break,

91
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:02,888
so I was here at the office.

92
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:06,088
Then, I heard a loud noise.

93
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:08,988
So you all came here

94
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:11,488
since you heard the loud noise, right?

95
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:14,688
No one saw the pipes was collapsing?

96
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:18,288
Is this an accident?

97
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,988
Or maybe...

98
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,988
We haven't put aside the possibility of homicide yet.

99
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,688
If I remember correctly,

100
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:32,788
Mr. Kaneda borrowed money from Mr. Inomata.

101
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:33,788
What the...

102
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:36,188
The other day, I heard Mr. Kaneda say

103
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:40,988
that if Inomata disappears, he can call it a wash.

104
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,788
Hey, hold on!

105
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,188
It's true that I did say that.

106
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:48,788
It was because I was a bit pissed back then.

107
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,688
What makes you think that I'd go as far as to kill somebody

108
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:52,088
just because of something like that?

109
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:55,688
I think you would.

110
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,888
If so, then you're just as prone to, aren't you?

111
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:00,588
You were arguing with Inomata

112
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,088
on whether to lower or higher the architectural fee, weren't you?

113
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,688
That's right. You're the one who specified

114
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,388
that place to be the smoking area too, right?

115
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:09,388
You specified that place so that you could

116
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,388
take your grudge out on Mr. Inomata, didn't you?

117
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,988
I have no grudge against Mr. Inomata.

118
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,988
Don't play dumb with me!

119
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,688
Mr. Kaneda, calm down.

120
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,788
Come to think of it, you're to be suspected too.

121
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:24,088
You were angry after Mr. Inomata turned

122
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,688
your concept of the plan down many times.

123
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,988
No. I would never do that.

124
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:33,888
Well, calm down, everyone.

125
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,688
At any rate, I didn't do it.

126
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,588
Inspector Megure.

127
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,688
From the blade of the knife that was found,

128
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,288
a band made of the same nylon

129
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:50,888
that was holding the pipes together was found.

130
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,688
Judging from the way the substance was stuck on,

131
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,788
there's seems to be no mistake

132
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,188
that the band was severed with this knife.

133
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:58,988
Good work.

134
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:03,488
Well, so this is it.

135
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,288
The culprit is Mr. Kaneda.

136
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,588
It's you.

137
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:08,288
Why me?

138
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,788
There's no use to play dumb.

139
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,688
This is yours, isn't it?

140
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,488
Your name is carved on it.

141
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:19,088
After Mr. Murase went outside to receive a phone call,

142
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,588
you pretended to go out to buy coffee

143
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,788
and went around behind where the pipes were stored.

144
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,288
You used the knife that you had with you

145
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:29,188
to cut the band that was holding the pipes together.

146
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:31,588
And after the pipes collapsed,

147
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:33,588
you ran over to the site of the accident

148
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:34,788
as if you knew nothing of it.

149
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,688
-But I don't think that was possible. -What?

150
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:40,888
Because out of all the pipes that were bundled together,

151
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,788
only the pipes nearest to the smoking area were collapsed.

152
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:45,988
There seems to be no space

153
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:49,688
for anyone to hide in an arm's reach, you see.

154
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:51,488
And yet, if the band holding the pipes together

155
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:52,588
were cut from smoking area side,

156
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:54,588
it would be in clear view from Mr. Inomata.

157
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:55,988
First of all, the culprit would also be at risk

158
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,588
of being struck by the pipes.

159
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:59,588
-So... -Shut up!

160
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:01,888
The culprit somehow managed to follow through.

161
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,688
How he managed it?

162
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,188
At any rate,

163
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:08,188
there's no doubt that Kaneda is the culprit.

164
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:11,088
The knife at the site is immovable evidence.

165
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:14,588
Wrong. I lost it yesterday.

166
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:18,288
You can make up an excuse like that any way you want.

167
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:19,888
Then, Mr. Kaneda,

168
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:21,088
would you please tell us about your knife

169
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:24,188
as well as some other details?

170
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,988
I don't mind.

171
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:27,888
But I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

172
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:31,388
May I excuse myself to go to the restroom?

173
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:34,088
I would like to make a call to my office.

174
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,188
All right.

175
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:37,888
I'd like to also talk to you two later,

176
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:40,188
so please don't leave the premises.

177
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,888
Even from what the forensics came up,

178
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,488
there's no doubt about the fact

179
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,888
that the band was cut with that knife.

180
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,288
But I wonder if anyone would risk doing something like that

181
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,488
knowing that he would also be endangering himself.

182
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,688
Besides, the sound back then...

183
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,388
This is...

184
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,288
Sir, what's this?

185
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,988
Oh, that?

186
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:45,888
That's the plan of the concept

187
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,088
that Mr. Murase showed Mr. Inomata.

188
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:52,088
But he seems to have thrown it away after it was turned down.

189
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:53,788
Isn't that the tile picture

190
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,688
that was in the public bath that used to be here?

191
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,188
It used to be in the bath tub

192
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,388
and looked like there was a real carp inside.

193
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:03,088
The men's restroom. Men's restroom.

194
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,088
Conan, there you are.

195
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,388
Stay put because it's dangerous.

196
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,988
Ran. I have to go to the restroom,

197
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:13,588
but Pops is in there now.

198
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:19,288
I'm so sorry to have to trouble you like this suddenly.

199
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:22,088
No problem at all.

200
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,188
Thank you, director.

201
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,588
Conan, are you all right?

202
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,988
Are you all right?

203
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,688
I'm sorry that it's slippery here

204
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,088
since the floor's just been waxed.

205
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:36,288
No, not at all. We're sorry for troubling you.

206
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,988
May I buy a bottle of tea at the vending machine?

207
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:42,788
Sure. I don't mind the least bit.

208
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,788
Go right ahead.

209
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,088
Huh? It's tepid.

210
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,488
It's still being cooled, I guess.

211
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:52,688
See.

212
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,788
"Cooling" -That's true.

213
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:55,888
Huh?

214
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:59,488
Did the vending machine man come today?

215
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:03,488
No. We're not doing business today because of renovations.

216
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:05,388
Director, could I speak to you for a minute?

217
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,488
Yes, I'll be right over.

218
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:09,788
I'll have to go.

219
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,988
Come again and visit us after we open, okay?

220
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,188
Sure.

221
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:15,688
Okay, let's head back then.

222
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:17,688
Hey, Conan.

223
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,788
You'll fall again, you know.

224
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,388
"Electrical room"

225
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,988
This is...

226
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:47,188
Conan. What's the matter?

227
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,488
Conan?

228
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:07,338
The fingerprints have been verified.

229
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:11,138
The prints on the knife are undoubtedly Mr. Kaneda's.

230
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:17,138
Good work.

231
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:20,738
Then, we'll have Mr. Kaneda come with us to the station.

232
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,638
Why did it turn up like this?

233
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:27,638
May I return to the main office?

234
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:28,838
Me, too.

235
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:31,038
Well then, as to both of you,

236
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,038
we'll be contacting you again if necessary.

237
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:34,838
You may go for today.

238
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,638
Thank you.

239
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:38,138
Is he going voluntarily?

240
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:41,238
I'm sorry, but could you bring the car around?

241
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,938
Roger, sir.

242
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,438
Officer Chiba.

243
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,538
What is it, Conan?

244
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:54,138
-Mr. Mouri? -Yes.

245
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:59,238
Hey, enough already.

246
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,138
I didn't do it, I tell you.

247
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:05,138
We'll hear you out, all you want at the station.

248
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:12,038
Dad?

249
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,038
Please wait, everyone.

250
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,538
Mr. Kaneda is not the culprit.

251
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,638
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

252
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,938
His fingerprints were also found on the knife, you know.

253
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:27,738
Besides, you even said that he was the culprit.

254
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:30,038
It's true I did say that,

255
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:33,738
but I'd like to revise all the deductions I made thus far.

256
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:37,638
The culprit is among the people here.

257
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:39,938
I thought it was strange

258
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,038
that the knife would be left behind at the site.

259
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:46,938
It's true that it's thinkable that the culprit may have dropped it.

260
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:50,038
But if so, what should also be here is missing.

261
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,838
What should also be here?

262
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,438
What is that?

263
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,138
Please take another good look

264
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:58,638
at where the knife was found on the ground.

265
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:01,238
Right near it is the ashtray.

266
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:03,738
Because of the pipes, it's totally crushed.

267
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:04,938
It smashed under the weight

268
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,838
and sunk deep into the ground.

269
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,538
That's true.

270
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:12,138
But what about the knife?

271
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,838
There's no sign of it being sunk in the ground.

272
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:15,338
Exactly.

273
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:18,238
It's heavy enough to kill a person.

274
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,838
Therefore, it's hard to think that

275
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,738
there is no trace of the knife having sunk deep.

276
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,538
What does that mean?

277
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:27,338
It was placed there by the culprit

278
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:31,038
after the pipes collapsed.

279
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,238
What?

280
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,038
Is that true?

281
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:39,138
The culprit probably stole the knife from Mr. Kaneda last night.

282
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:44,938
He used it to inconspicuously slit the back side of the band.

283
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:47,938
Then, he banded the pipes a bit firmly together.

284
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:50,538
After confirming that Mr. Inomata began smoking

285
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:54,038
and Mr. Kaneda left the site,

286
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:56,438
the culprit also left.

287
00:15:57,838 --> 00:16:01,238
Didn't the culprit cut the band with the knife?

288
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:04,238
No. Because if he directly cut the band,

289
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:07,338
he would also be endangering himself.

290
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:11,238
That's why the culprit used a certain something to cut the band.

291
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,938
A certain something?

292
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,438
Please look at the next building behind me.

293
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:18,538
You mean the amusement facility?

294
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:19,538
From the window on the second floor

295
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,138
of the prefab of the construction site,

296
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:23,638
you can see the emergency door next to it, can't you?

297
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:27,038
What about it?

298
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,138
Officer Chiba.

299
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:30,138
From what I confirmed,

300
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,438
the window of the 2nd floor of the prefab was open

301
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,338
and it was possible to look straight at the pipes

302
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:36,538
from the amusement facility.

303
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,838
Don't tell me you're saying that the culprit

304
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:41,638
severed the band holding the pipes together from there?

305
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,538
No way.

306
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:46,038
Officer Chiba, please go ahead.

307
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,538
Yes, sir.

308
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:50,038
The culprit operated the breaker

309
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:52,738
that is on the 1st floor of that building,

310
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:55,038
made a certain something on the 2nd floor move

311
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:57,338
and committed the crime.

312
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:01,438
Mr. Mouri, what is that certain something?

313
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,638
This is...

314
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,638
A pitching machine?

315
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:11,938
Exactly.

316
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:14,138
At around noon today when the incident occurred,

317
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,938
the window of the prefab was open.

318
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,038
When I confirmed further,

319
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,238
the amusement facility was undergoing renovation,

320
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:24,138
so the door of the emergency door was also open.

321
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:28,838
Neither the nets nor the glass was set up yet.

322
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,338
In other words, at the time of the incident

323
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:32,338
from the site where the pipes

324
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:34,638
were to the pitching machine on the 2nd floor,

325
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,638
a path was formed.

326
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,038
The culprit probably set the pitching machine up beforehand

327
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:43,938
to throwing position

328
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,538
and turned down the breaker of the building.

329
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:49,938
After confirming that Mr. Inomata was in the smoking area,

330
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,138
he turned the breaker back on.

331
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:02,238
In other words, the culprit used the impact of the ball

332
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:04,738
going through a narrow path and made the pipes collapse

333
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:08,038
to kill Mr. Inomata.

334
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,338
And the culprit who committed the crime probably...

335
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:20,638
is you, Mr. Murase.

336
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,138
You...

337
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,838
I hope you have evidence to back up what you're saying.

338
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:30,738
The evidence is your shoe.

339
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,138
To be more exact, the sole of your shoe.

340
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:35,738
Ran, show me the sole of your shoe.

341
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:38,738
What? Mine?

342
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,638
Okay.

343
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,638
What's this red yarn?

344
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:48,438
It's the yarn from the rug of the amusement facility, Funfun.

345
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:50,038
If the same thing found on Ran's shoe

346
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,838
is found on the sole of Mr. Murase's shoe,

347
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:55,838
it would be evidence that he went to Funfun.

348
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:58,638
Excuse me, but will you show it to me?

349
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,438
It's there.

350
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:05,238
But this is only circumstantial evidence, isn't it?

351
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,638
I won't have a mere yarn making me as a culprit.

352
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:10,738
It's natural that there's no concrete evidence.

353
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:14,538
However, it's certain that the trace of a ball was found,

354
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,638
together with the prints of Mr. Murase's shoes.

355
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,838
After running over to the scene of the crime,

356
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,038
you hid the ball that is evidence, didn't you?

357
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,938
Where's that proof?

358
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:26,538
Probably inside that debris?

359
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:31,338
After all, Mr. Murase hasn't gone off the premises at all.

360
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,638
Officer Takagi.

361
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,038
Yes, sir.

362
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:42,238
I found it.

363
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,138
This is it, right?

364
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:48,138
Why would Mr. Murase want to kill Mr. Inomata?

365
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:51,838
Because your concept was turned down?

366
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,838
Wrong.

367
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:56,838
It's because...

368
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:58,838
I hated Inomata.

369
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,438
Up until now,

370
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:04,238
he bought up land cheaply using ruthless methods.

371
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:05,738
He established a large scale chain

372
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,838
of multi-purpose bathing facilities.

373
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:10,138
Among one of the lands that he bought at an extremely cheap price

374
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:14,038
was my parental home's public bath house.

375
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,638
My mother fell ill because of this and died.

376
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:22,838
My father committed suicide as if going after her.

377
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:25,538
But I didn't do it because I hated him for that.

378
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:29,938
I found out that this construction site

379
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,038
was once a public bathing house

380
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:34,338
and built in an architectural concept

381
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:37,438
hoping to at least leave a slight trace of what it used to be.

382
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:39,238
But he...

383
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,438
He snickered saying that public bathing houses were out of date.

384
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,538
He remarked that there was no need

385
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,838
for such old fashioned and moldy things anymore.

386
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,038
He called me names.

387
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,638
A lot of memories...

388
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:04,438
of my Dad and I are packed in the public bathing house.

389
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:08,738
All those memories, he had the nerve to...

390
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:19,438
That's why I killed him!

391
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:20,738
All my precious memories,

392
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,538
he stepped all over them and crushed them.

393
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,738
That's why I killed Inomata.

394
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:28,838
Mr. Murase.

395
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:31,838
It's not that I don't understand how you feel.

396
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:34,138
However,

397
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:38,538
just because he stepped all over your memories and crushed them,

398
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:43,038
it doesn't give you the right to kill anyone.

399
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,738
Besides, Mr. Murase,

400
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,038
Mr. Inomata also has a family

401
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,538
and I'm sure they had precious memories, too.

402
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,838
You destroyed their memories, you know.

403
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,138
Dad, hang in there!

404
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:28,538
Shut up!

405
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,738
I'm trying to concentrate.

406
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:36,038
I'll show you my ultra super technique now.

407
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,438
My hips!

408
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:49,938
It sure is an ultra super technique all right.

409
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:55,438
"Next Episode"

410
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:56,838
What?

411
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,638
Homicide.

412
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:04,038
I'm telling you, no matter how you look at it, this is murder.

413
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:11,438
Let's listen to what those three have to say again then.

414
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:12,938
I'm sure they'd have no idea

415
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:16,738
that they would be suspected at such an early stage.

416
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:22,138
Next Conan, "Everyone Was Watching (Part 1)"

417
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:39,938
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,438
"Cleaning robot"

419
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,438
Appetite, sports and maple leaves bring to mind.

420
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:46,938
-Beer! -Autumn, you idiot.
