1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.230
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.060
Conan's logic works great on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.810
Today's case is a midsummer night!
I crush the culprit's dreams!

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.350
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.480
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.060
His name?

7
00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.709
The Triplets Villa Murder Case.

8
00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.079
Summer! You got your sun and your ocean!
Izu

9
00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.239
Summer! You got your sun and your ocean!

10
00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.529
Still, I can't believe Conan-kun's
the only boy on the beach

11
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:55.839
when there's two hot girls here!
How pathetic!

12
00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:57.969
Well, excuse me!

13
00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.429
Obviously! This is
your villa's private beach!

14
00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:03.859
Oh, yeah!

15
00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.399
We're here to get a great tan
and catch guys all summer long!

16
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.289
You're always talking
about guys, Sonoko...

17
00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:17.209
It must be nice to know
who your husband'll be!

18
00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.269
You bought that swimsuit to
show Shinichi-kun, didn't you?

19
00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.509
That... was for me?!

20
00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.629
Since I'm here,
I'll get a closer look!

21
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.889
Yuzo-san!

22
00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.269
Young girls are so nice!

23
00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.379
Tomizawa Yuzo (28) Ayako's Fiancé
I shouldn't have gotten engaged yet!

24
00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.439
Tomizawa Yuzo (28) Ayako's Fiancé

25
00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.329
Oh, you! You're supposed
to be in love with my sister!

26
00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.399
So he's--

27
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.409
Yep!

28
00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.869
Tomizawa Yuzo-san, third son of
the head of Tomizawa Industries!

29
00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.199
He's marrying my sister in the fall!

30
00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.639
Our two family
companies are really close!

31
00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.409
Tomizawa Family Villa
Suzuki Family Villa
Our two family
companies are really close!

32
00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.369
Look! Even our villas are next to each other!
Tomizawa Family Villa
Suzuki Family Villa

33
00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:01.409
Look! Even our villas are next to each other!

34
00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.289
He saw my sister at a party
and had love at first sight!

35
00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.369
You're embarrassing me,
Sonoko-chan...

36
00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.889
She's in our villa
if you're looking for her...

37
00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.179
No, I'm here to introduce
her to my father and brothers!

38
00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.889
So then--

39
00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.139
They're all coming?

40
00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.459
Yeah. My brothers arrive tomorrow,

41
00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.609
but my father should be
at the villa by now.

42
00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.119
I'll give him a call.

43
00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.539
This is the Tomizawa residence.
We're not home right now,

44
00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.789
so please leave a message
after the beep--

45
00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.749
Huh? It's the machine...

46
00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.599
Do you have the time?

47
00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.409
3:10...

48
00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.999
That's weird. He was
supposed to be there at 3:00...

49
00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:50.409
What's wrong, Sonoko?

50
00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.369
Tetsuhara-ojisama is coming!
This is no time to play in the ocean!

51
00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.869
I have to greet him!

52
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.179
Wait! Sonoko!

53
00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:03.809
Oh!

54
00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.959
Dad!

55
00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.519
Oh, Yuzo! I came over here.

56
00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.989
Ugh! I said to wait in the
villa for me to bring her there!

57
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:15.329
Tomizawa Tetsuhara (60) President

58
00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.289
I thought we might enjoy
Tomizawa Tetsuhara (60) President

59
00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.249
I thought we might enjoy

60
00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.949
your future wife's cooking tonight!
Suzuki Ayako- Sonoko's Sister

61
00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.909
He sent it flying!

62
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:29.749
It's gone! Three runs! Kogure sent
it into the right stands in the rain!

63
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:31.079
Yes!

64
00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.839
Dad. You're sure
a big Kogure fan...

65
00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.869
I sure am!

66
00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:38.179
But you didn't have
to watch him here.

67
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:43.789
I had no choice. I'm getting
bad satellite reception.

68
00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:50.079
A pop fly down the center!
The Falcons are on fire now!

69
00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:55.819
It's 9:00, so we bring you
a 5-minute news break!

70
00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:01.039
Typhoon 11 has intensified and
is moving northward from Okinawa.

71
00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.829
As a result, many planes
and boats are delayed.

72
00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:07.489
9:00? It's only the 6th inning...

73
00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:10.119
The rain kept delaying the game.

74
00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:14.119
Ayako-san. Might you have a radio?

75
00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:17.179
It doesn't look like
that game's on the radio...

76
00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:24.179
Now, now! It'll begin soon!
How about some coffee?

77
00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:28.249
Suzuki women are so considerate!

78
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.939
Yuzo! You're one lucky guy!

79
00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.749
My other two sons,
on the other hand...

80
00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:40.949
Taichi, the oldest, ditched the
business and became a novelist instead.

81
00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.999
So he's still single.

82
00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.789
Tatsuji, the middle son,
joined the company

83
00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.669
but got engaged with some
nobody without my consent!

84
00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.629
Stop talking bad about them!

85
00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.629
You too, Yuzo!
With your stupid paintings and all!

86
00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:58.839
Yuzo-san!

87
00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:04.749
I'll be in my studio.
I have an illustration to finish.

88
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:05.639
Yuzo-san!

89
00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:09.459
If only he'd quit being
stubborn and join the business,

90
00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.109
I'd give him a good position!

91
00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:21.029
It's over! The Falcons finally
win 9-8 in the 11th inning!

92
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.409
Yes! Alright! Hurray!

93
00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.499
This is the essence
of Falcons baseball!

94
00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.919
Oh, look at the time.
I should get back to my villa.

95
00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:38.289
Alright, Ayako-san.
I'll bring my sons over tomorrow.

96
00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.759
Is that all right?

97
00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.459
Of course!

98
00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:47.809
Geez! I wonder if he plans to
watch another night game tomorrow...

99
00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:53.539
Oh, it's already 11:30. We should--

100
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:54.569
A power failure?!

101
00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.149
Looks like it.

102
00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.749
See? The lights
are out in the other villa...

103
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:02.949
It must've been the lightning!

104
00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:06.869
What is that?

105
00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:08.819
Someone's there!

106
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:09.869
Who is that?

107
00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:11.619
What's he doing?!

108
00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:18.669
Y-Yuzo-san!

109
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:22.509
Conan-kun!

110
00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:24.719
Stop!

111
00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:29.099
Conan-kun! Wait!

112
00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:37.289
Darn it! I lost him!

113
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:41.989
Sir!

114
00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.489
Sir! Sir!

115
00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.079
What the...

116
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:57.919
I see.

117
00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:04.579
So you witnessed Mr. Tomizawa
being murdered by his son Yuzo

118
00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:06.409
at 11:30 last night?

119
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:07.179
Yes.

120
00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:12.539
Ayako-san. What's all this about?

121
00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:14.399
Yuzo-san!

122
00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.379
Tomizawa Yuzo?!

123
00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:17.619
Y-Yes...

124
00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:18.689
Did something happen?

125
00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:22.749
You know full well
you killed your own father!

126
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:26.539
Eh?! Dad?! That's crazy!

127
00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:29.959
Hey! Let go! I didn't kill him!

128
00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.749
What's going on, Yuzo?

129
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.369
Tomizawa Tatsuji (28) Office Worker
Tatsuji-niisan!

130
00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:35.959
What's all the ruckus?
Tomizawa Tatsuji (28) Office Worker

131
00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.579
Taichi-aniki!
Looks like something happened!

132
00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:42.039
Tomizawa Taichi (28) Novelist
Perfect timing.

133
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.379
I need an idea for a new novel...
Tomizawa Taichi (28) Novelist

134
00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:48.139
Triplets?!

135
00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:52.349
Tomizawa Yuzo! You're under
arrest for the murder of your father!

136
00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:54.999
Detective! Please wait!

137
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.649
We did see the killer's face...

138
00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:02.289
...But we only
saw his eyes and nose!

139
00:09:02.289 --> 00:09:07.819
We didn't know Yuzo-san
had two identical twins!

140
00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:12.789
Which means it was one of you three...

141
00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:17.789
I was in Okinawa
last night on a business trip.

142
00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:21.539
I took the first flight out and
landed at Haneda three hours ago.

143
00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:25.869
The last flight to
Okinawa leaves at 8:00 pm.

144
00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:28.969
I couldn't have been
at the villa when it happened!

145
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.979
Check it out!

146
00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:31.679
Yes, sir!

147
00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:34.639
I thought Okinawa was--

148
00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:39.859
Say, Detective. I'm not
sure I can call it an alibi, but...

149
00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:42.859
You have two messages.

150
00:09:43.579 --> 00:09:45.469
Do you have the time?

151
00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:47.249
3:10...

152
00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:52.039
That's weird. He was
supposed to be there at 3:00...

153
00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.289
3:10 pm.

154
00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:57.749
That was me! I called from the beach!

155
00:09:57.749 --> 00:09:59.559
Hello, this is Taichi.

156
00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:01.249
Here's mine.

157
00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:04.709
Glad to see the Falcons won, Dad!

158
00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:09.409
Kogure pulled that homer to
the right in the bottom of the 6th!

159
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:14.039
What a batter!
Well, see you tomorrow!

160
00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:17.249
11:34 pm.

161
00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:21.189
11:34 pm... The time
the murder took place.

162
00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:26.609
You're certain it
happened around 11:30?

163
00:10:26.789 --> 00:10:31.569
Yes! I had checked the
clock before we saw the killer!

164
00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:37.709
Doesn't look like he did it!
That game was only on satellite!

165
00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:40.789
It ended just after 11:25.

166
00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:43.539
He couldn't have known how
it ended unless he watched it all!

167
00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.459
Confirm that with the
TV and radio stations! Hurry!

168
00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:48.009
Yes, sir!

169
00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:51.869
Say, if neither of us is the killer...

170
00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:54.079
...Yuzo's the only possibility.

171
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.219
Brother!

172
00:10:55.579 --> 00:10:58.079
No! I'd never kill anyone!

173
00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.189
Then where were you last night?

174
00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.959
I was in my studio the whole time.

175
00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:08.649
Yes! A fellow illustrator called
and woke me up! Just after 11:30!

176
00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:10.759
He woke you up?

177
00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:11.539
Yes!

178
00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:15.869
I dozed off! I had to pull
an all-nighter to finish this job...

179
00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:18.249
Then we'll check with him!

180
00:11:18.249 --> 00:11:21.979
Detective Yokomizo!
About that passenger list...

181
00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:29.709
What? My name was there, right?

182
00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:32.249
Yes, it was.

183
00:11:32.249 --> 00:11:35.389
The issue is the
time the plane landed!

184
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:42.249
The plane you were supposedly on
landed at Haneda thirty minutes ago!

185
00:11:42.249 --> 00:11:43.519
That can't be!

186
00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:48.119
I guess the typhoon delayed it!
They said so on the news last night!

187
00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:49.489
Yeah, you're right!

188
00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:54.449
How about you tell us
where you really were last night?!

189
00:11:54.449 --> 00:12:00.459
Tokyo! That's right!
I returned to Tokyo last night!

190
00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:02.159
To Hiromi's place in Tokyo!

191
00:12:02.469 --> 00:12:03.409
Hiromi?

192
00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:07.879
My fiancée.
I heard she had collapsed...

193
00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:12.369
I didn't want my dad to
find out I dropped work for her,

194
00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:14.009
so I had someone cover for me!

195
00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:16.469
It's the truth! Please believe me!

196
00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.209
Can anyone vouch for this?

197
00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:19.219
Hiromi.

198
00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:22.959
Yeah! I just mentioned
how the game ended!

199
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:27.209
No news programs
were covering it at 11:30!

200
00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:31.939
I know, because I flipped channels,
hoping to see that home run again!

201
00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:35.369
Detective Yokomizo.
He's telling the truth.

202
00:12:35.369 --> 00:12:40.449
It was after midnight when TV
and radio stations covered the game.

203
00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:44.659
Say, are you a fan of Kogure?

204
00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:47.669
You were praising him on the phone!

205
00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:54.339
He's awesome! Only he could
hit a home run into the right stands!

206
00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:58.209
Hit?! Explain yourself, Taichi-san!

207
00:12:58.209 --> 00:13:01.329
You said he pulled it
to the right on the phone!

208
00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:03.849
Were you really
watching that game?!

209
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.309
Guess the truth's out.

210
00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:09.019
So you killed your father?!

211
00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:16.209
Nothing of the sort! I meant
that I didn't see the game on TV.

212
00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:20.909
I listened to it all on the
radio while playing pachinko.

213
00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:24.369
I was taking a break from writing...

214
00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:29.079
I guess the only radio broadcast
was in Osaka, where I live.

215
00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:33.549
He's right, only one radio station
in Osaka aired that game.

216
00:13:33.909 --> 00:13:38.639
Besides, I left a message
at the time of the murder.

217
00:13:38.909 --> 00:13:41.099
Yes, that's true...

218
00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:46.189
Who is it?!
One of those three is lying!

219
00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:50.909
And the victim's
missing watch bugs me!

220
00:13:50.909 --> 00:13:53.249
Why would the killer take it?

221
00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.149
To keep the time a secret? Or--

222
00:13:56.409 --> 00:13:59.159
Huh? This VCR is blinking!

223
00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:03.869
Yeah, there was a 10-minute
blackout at 11:30 last night!

224
00:14:03.869 --> 00:14:08.209
Oh, yeah! There was a
blackout just before the murder!

225
00:14:08.209 --> 00:14:09.079
A blackout?

226
00:14:09.789 --> 00:14:13.619
Wait, this is strange!
What he said is impossible!

227
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:16.209
And at the time, it was--

228
00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:19.089
Then the watch
taken from the victim was...

229
00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:21.259
Could it be?!

230
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:27.709
No doubt about it!
The killer is the one telling two lies!

231
00:14:33.953 --> 00:14:36.813
I have to ask all three
of you down to the station!

232
00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:38.613
But...

233
00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:40.363
Hey, this isn't funny!

234
00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:42.033
Why me?

235
00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:43.733
We have no choice.

236
00:14:44.153 --> 00:14:49.783
These folks saw the killer's
face just after the murder!

237
00:14:49.783 --> 00:14:52.583
One that looked just like you three!

238
00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:58.043
In other words,
one of you killed your father!

239
00:14:58.743 --> 00:15:04.003
I know who did it! It's definitely
the one with the strange alibi!

240
00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:08.423
Alright! I'll knock Sonoko
out and make her a detective!

241
00:15:09.093 --> 00:15:10.993
What're you doing, Conan-kun?!

242
00:15:12.243 --> 00:15:14.053
What's with this watch?!

243
00:15:14.053 --> 00:15:14.813
It's--

244
00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:17.203
What's the matter?

245
00:15:17.203 --> 00:15:20.903
He was aiming a weird watch at you.

246
00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:25.113
It's a toy!
Professor Agasa gave it to me!

247
00:15:25.113 --> 00:15:27.733
A BB comes out if you press a button!

248
00:15:27.733 --> 00:15:30.493
You're such a troublemaker!

249
00:15:30.493 --> 00:15:32.493
I gotta use the bathroom!

250
00:15:41.113 --> 00:15:43.883
Sonoko?! Hey, Sonoko!

251
00:15:44.453 --> 00:15:50.453
I've figured it out. I know that
he killed Tetsuhara-ojisama!

252
00:15:51.703 --> 00:15:56.493
Not one of the
three has a clear alibi!

253
00:15:56.493 --> 00:16:00.823
But there's one who's clearly lying!

254
00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:03.313
The killer is Taichi-san!

255
00:16:03.313 --> 00:16:04.993
Taichi-san?!

256
00:16:04.993 --> 00:16:06.983
Sure, kid!

257
00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:11.573
Interesting. But I was in
an Osaka pachinko parlor.

258
00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:14.783
I don't think
I could've been here then.

259
00:16:14.783 --> 00:16:17.413
A pachinko parlor at 11:30?

260
00:16:17.993 --> 00:16:19.373
Yeah, that's right.

261
00:16:20.453 --> 00:16:24.823
Don't you know that pachinko parlors

262
00:16:24.823 --> 00:16:27.803
can only stay open until 11:00 pm?!

263
00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:34.973
Yes, pachinko parlors are generally
forbidden to operate past 11:00!

264
00:16:35.363 --> 00:16:37.243
Even in Osaka!

265
00:16:37.243 --> 00:16:40.613
That means you're lying!

266
00:16:40.613 --> 00:16:42.073
My mistake!

267
00:16:42.073 --> 00:16:45.943
I heard the broadcast in a taxi
on my way home from the parlor...

268
00:16:45.943 --> 00:16:47.493
Honestly?!

269
00:16:47.493 --> 00:16:50.403
Don't be like that.
It was a simple mistake.

270
00:16:50.863 --> 00:16:55.743
Besides, I left a message
when the murder took place!

271
00:16:55.743 --> 00:16:57.783
How do you explain that?

272
00:16:57.783 --> 00:16:59.373
I can!

273
00:16:59.863 --> 00:17:04.083
And the major oversight
you made during the murder!

274
00:17:04.453 --> 00:17:05.673
What?!

275
00:17:06.403 --> 00:17:09.453
You should know; you were there!

276
00:17:09.453 --> 00:17:12.723
The power went out
for ten minutes at 11:30!

277
00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:17.903
Yes! The answering machine
wouldn't work without power!

278
00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:22.103
Its batteries power the clock,
but it can't record messages!

279
00:17:22.703 --> 00:17:27.563
So what's your message
doing there at 11:34?

280
00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:31.573
But you could ask
Yuzo the same thing!

281
00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:35.283
He said he got a call
just after 11:30!

282
00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:37.703
You don't know anything, do you?

283
00:17:37.703 --> 00:17:40.993
You can still make calls
during a power outage!

284
00:17:41.453 --> 00:17:42.953
What?!

285
00:17:42.953 --> 00:17:48.463
It's true. Telephones receive
power through the phone lines.

286
00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:53.153
Someone must've messed with
the clock to frame me--

287
00:17:53.153 --> 00:17:54.883
There's no telling when you'd call.

288
00:17:55.243 --> 00:17:59.853
Nobody could've
matched the times just right.

289
00:17:59.853 --> 00:18:02.743
In other words, when the game ended,
you left a message

290
00:18:02.743 --> 00:18:07.243
on the machine whose clock
you had set ahead in advance.

291
00:18:07.243 --> 00:18:09.863
Glad to see the Falcons won, Dad!

292
00:18:10.363 --> 00:18:14.073
As if you left the message
just when the murder happened!

293
00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:19.283
Then you turned the clock back,
and waited for your father to return.

294
00:18:19.903 --> 00:18:24.003
Your father, who came
next door to see the game!

295
00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:27.463
And that's when you killed him!

296
00:18:27.463 --> 00:18:32.243
But I couldn't have
known when he'd return!

297
00:18:32.243 --> 00:18:36.743
No, you knew.
You used a transmitter to hear!

298
00:18:36.743 --> 00:18:37.843
A transmitter?!

299
00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:45.643
I bugged your villa? Then go ahead
and look! There won't be any!

300
00:18:46.113 --> 00:18:49.243
Nobody said you bugged the house.

301
00:18:49.243 --> 00:18:53.363
Isn't there something unnaturally
missing from the victim?

302
00:18:53.363 --> 00:18:55.073
His watch!

303
00:18:55.363 --> 00:18:58.363
Aha! With a bugged watch,

304
00:18:58.363 --> 00:19:01.823
he could keep tabs on
both the victim and the game!

305
00:19:02.573 --> 00:19:06.363
So the watch was taken
to remove the evidence?

306
00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:07.543
That's right!

307
00:19:08.033 --> 00:19:10.743
Bugging the victim's watch,

308
00:19:10.743 --> 00:19:16.763
and breaking his satellite receiver
to make him come to my villa...

309
00:19:17.453 --> 00:19:21.073
As his son, you could easily do this!

310
00:19:22.243 --> 00:19:26.433
Nice theory. I almost
want to use it for a book.

311
00:19:26.903 --> 00:19:29.323
But it'd be a third-rate novel.

312
00:19:29.323 --> 00:19:34.153
Do you have any proof that I changed
the answering machine's clock?

313
00:19:34.493 --> 00:19:40.783
The times match; even
Yuzo's message had the right time.

314
00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:43.913
You talk big for having no proof--

315
00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:45.243
Quit playin' around!

316
00:19:45.613 --> 00:19:50.323
The fake time and message
on the answering machine

317
00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:54.173
actually prove that you're the killer!

318
00:19:56.073 --> 00:19:57.563
Brother!

319
00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:58.263
It can't be true!

320
00:19:58.263 --> 00:20:01.153
Yeah! This must be a mistake!

321
00:20:01.153 --> 00:20:03.723
You had no reason to kill Dad!

322
00:20:04.033 --> 00:20:09.433
Stop that, Yuzo. I'm not the
great brother you take me for.

323
00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:13.153
Money. I wanted the
old man's inheritance.

324
00:20:13.153 --> 00:20:14.903
So I could keep writing.

325
00:20:15.333 --> 00:20:16.193
Brother!

326
00:20:16.743 --> 00:20:21.493
Things got tough. I suddenly
ran out of work and money...

327
00:20:21.493 --> 00:20:26.203
I found out when
I went to Dad for help...

328
00:20:26.203 --> 00:20:31.663
He had pressured the publishers
to drop each job that came my way!

329
00:20:32.743 --> 00:20:37.993
I guess he wanted me to
quit and follow in his footsteps.

330
00:20:37.993 --> 00:20:39.513
So then you--

331
00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:45.153
Yeah. I used his
visit here to kill him.

332
00:20:45.153 --> 00:20:51.433
That's also why I sent him the
bugged watch and broke his receiver.

333
00:20:51.953 --> 00:20:57.823
Yuzo. I was going
to try pinning it on you.

334
00:20:57.823 --> 00:21:00.153
To increase my
share of the inheritance.

335
00:21:01.323 --> 00:21:04.903
It was all so I could
keep writing my novels...

336
00:21:04.903 --> 00:21:08.623
But it seems I wrote a poor mystery.

337
00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:11.913
To think the power
would go out just then...

338
00:21:13.823 --> 00:21:17.383
I guess fact is
stranger than fiction...

339
00:21:18.743 --> 00:21:22.493
Maybe I didn't have the
skill to be a writer.

340
00:22:55.563 --> 00:22:58.743
What's with Sonoko?
She's spacing out...

341
00:22:58.743 --> 00:23:02.523
She's probably relieved
Yuzo-san wasn't the killer!

342
00:23:04.863 --> 00:23:07.493
Uh oh. She's staring at her arm.

343
00:23:07.493 --> 00:23:10.453
Don't tell me she noticed
I shot a sleeping dart in it...

344
00:23:11.403 --> 00:23:12.663
I failed...

345
00:23:13.453 --> 00:23:16.243
What're you talking about?
That was great detective work!

346
00:23:16.243 --> 00:23:17.083
Detective work?

347
00:23:17.573 --> 00:23:19.543
Just look at my arm!

348
00:23:19.543 --> 00:23:21.753
It's totally white!

349
00:23:22.163 --> 00:23:26.713
I was supposed to get a tan
and catch some guys!

350
00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:32.153
I know, Ran!
Let's go to a tanning salon!

351
00:23:32.153 --> 00:23:36.283
Not now! We have to give our
statements at the police station!

352
00:23:36.283 --> 00:23:37.903
What for?!

353
00:23:39.073 --> 00:23:40.913
What a dumb girl...

354
00:23:45.573 --> 00:23:47.153
What the...

355
00:23:47.573 --> 00:23:48.953
It's an SOS!

356
00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:56.743
Everyone out of the boat!
The tide's rising!

357
00:23:57.823 --> 00:24:01.003
The waves are
too high for us to swim out!

358
00:24:01.703 --> 00:24:04.503
Darn it! This is like a maze!

359
00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:07.713
Which way?! Which way do we go?!

360
00:24:08.363 --> 00:24:09.863
On the next Conan--

361
00:24:09.863 --> 00:24:12.453
The Junior Detective League Shipwreck Case.

362
00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.226
Next Conan's hint:

363
00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:18.166
The Tide's Ebb and Flow.
