1
00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:02.924
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:04.724
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:06.824
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.524
Today is a special of a cursed mask.

5
00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:10.724
A mysterious room and an eerie smile.

6
00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:12.324
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:14.324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:16.324
His name is Detective Conan.

9
00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:57.857
Dad, be careful driving, will you?

10
00:01:57.857 --> 00:01:59.157
She's right.

11
00:01:59.157 --> 00:02:00.457
Remember? You're going to be performing

12
00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:02.257
on a charity show held for children

13
00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:05.357
who have lost their families In traffic accidents next week, Pops.

14
00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.857
If you get into an accident in a place like this,

15
00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:10.357
we couldn't face up to Ms. Beniko Suou,

16
00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:12.957
the hostess of the show who chose you as a guest.

17
00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:14.857
I know.

18
00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:18.457
Ms. Suou invited us to a party today, too.

19
00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:23.057
If I get into an accident, I'll miss out on all the good food.

20
00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:28.057
That person called Suou used to be a famous singer, right?

21
00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:31.457
Yes, she used to be a big star,

22
00:02:31.457 --> 00:02:32.957
once called "Canary of the Orient".

23
00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:35.257
But nowadays, she is busy taking care of a show biz promotion

24
00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:37.757
called "Kurenai Promotion". As its president,

25
00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:40.957
that she rarely stands on stage anymore.

26
00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:50.857
Of all things...

27
00:02:50.857 --> 00:02:52.257
Talk about danger.

28
00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:55.357
Why is this tree in the middle of the road like this?

29
00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:57.457
There's something posted on it.

30
00:02:58.257 --> 00:03:00.157
What's this?

31
00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:06.257
"Don't participate in the charity party held by Beniko Suou.

32
00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:07.957
You'll regret it.

33
00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:10.457
Messenger of the cursed mask."

34
00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.757
What's that supposed to mean?

35
00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:15.257
Messenger of the cursed mask?

36
00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:22.357
"The Cursed Mask Smile Callously"

37
00:03:36.057 --> 00:03:37.557
What a mansion.

38
00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:40.057
This is some mansion.

39
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.257
That guy...

40
00:03:46.257 --> 00:03:48.457
He's the photographer, Masanori Katagiri.

41
00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:50.757
What? You mean the one who travels around the world

42
00:03:50.757 --> 00:03:53.457
taking pictures of beautiful landscapes?

43
00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:54.457
"Masanori Katagiri (45), Photographer"

44
00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:01.457
"Mamoru Matsudaira (24)" -The king of home runs,

45
00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:03.257
"Profesional Baseball Player" -baseball player, Mamoru Matsudaira.

46
00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:06.457
Oh, and you're the renowned detective yourself.

47
00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:09.057
-You are Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right? -Yes, I am.

48
00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:12.357
Are you guests at the charity show to be held next week, too?

49
00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:13.557
Yes.

50
00:04:19.157 --> 00:04:20.857
What a beauty!

51
00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:23.757
She is Haruka Nagara.

52
00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:25.257
You mean the tarot fortuneteller

53
00:04:25.257 --> 00:04:26.757
that is super popular on TV and in the magazines?

54
00:04:26.757 --> 00:04:28.857
Looks like you know her, too.

55
00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:30.457
Every time I stand on the batter's base,

56
00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:33.557
I wear the color of gloves that matches the lucky color of today

57
00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:36.057
that she announces.

58
00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:38.157
And is that how you became the king of home runs?

59
00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:41.657
This is...

60
00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:43.157
What seems to be the matter?

61
00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.057
"Nagara Haruka (25)" -I feel something ominous...

62
00:04:45.057 --> 00:04:47.257
"Tarot Card Reader" -about this mansion.

63
00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:50.457
I feel that there is going to be large disaster.

64
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.957
What an eerie thing to say.

65
00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.757
Well, rather than talk out here,

66
00:04:55.757 --> 00:04:57.657
shouldn't we ask to be let in?

67
00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.457
Why yes!

68
00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:01.857
But, which door do we take

69
00:05:01.857 --> 00:05:03.957
to get into the mansion?

70
00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:07.757
There are two entrances.

71
00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:13.957
Thank you all for coming.

72
00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:16.757
Oh, so that side is the entrance.

73
00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:22.457
Thank you all for coming.

74
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:25.057
What is happening here?

75
00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:26.957
"Shimogasa Honami (21), Suou House Maid" -Will Mr. Mouri and his party

76
00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.057
enter from this side which is the east entrance.

77
00:05:30.057 --> 00:05:31.057
Huh?

78
00:05:31.057 --> 00:05:32.557
Only us?

79
00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:35.757
"Shimogasa Minaho (21)" -Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira and Ms. Nagara...

80
00:05:35.757 --> 00:05:38.557
"Suou House Maid" -come in from here, the west entrance.

81
00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:41.357
Why are we going in separately?

82
00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:45.157
The inside of this mansion is divided to the east and west.

83
00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.957
Those who will be spending the night in the rooms on the west side

84
00:05:47.957 --> 00:05:49.957
enter from the west entrance.

85
00:05:49.957 --> 00:05:52.957
And those who will spend the night in the rooms on the east side

86
00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:55.757
will enter from the east entrance.

87
00:05:55.757 --> 00:05:58.257
It is a tradition practiced here.

88
00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.357
What a strange place.

89
00:06:01.357 --> 00:06:04.257
If we don't stick to traditional practices in this mansion...

90
00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:06.857
Disaster befalls us.

91
00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:08.557
Disaster befalls?

92
00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:10.657
What makes you say that?

93
00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:12.657
Well, because this is the place where...

94
00:06:12.657 --> 00:06:14.657
Because this is the place where...

95
00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:17.657
The cursed mask resides.

96
00:06:21.357 --> 00:06:23.957
Cursed mask?

97
00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:43.857
It's a mask.

98
00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:46.157
There's one on this side, too.

99
00:06:46.157 --> 00:06:49.557
Mrs. Suou likes to collect masks.

100
00:06:49.557 --> 00:06:51.357
This way, please.

101
00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.157
Next, it's the mask of a cat.

102
00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:11.157
Your baggage has already been brought here,

103
00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:13.457
so please wait in the room of masks.

104
00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:15.857
The room of masks?

105
00:07:15.857 --> 00:07:17.957
This room here.

106
00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.057
Mr. Mouri?

107
00:07:27.057 --> 00:07:32.457
So this room connects the east and west wing of the mansion.

108
00:07:32.457 --> 00:07:34.357
This is fantastic!

109
00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:36.257
There are so many masks.

110
00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:53.357
Look at all this.

111
00:07:56.457 --> 00:07:58.257
What is this?

112
00:07:58.257 --> 00:08:00.157
A remote control?

113
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:04.457
What's happening?

114
00:08:04.457 --> 00:08:06.557
What on earth is this?

115
00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:13.157
What's with all these masks?

116
00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:14.957
What is all this?

117
00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:16.657
What are all these masks?

118
00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:18.657
These are called the masks of Chableu.

119
00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:21.157
You are...

120
00:08:21.157 --> 00:08:22.857
"Beniko Suou (63), Singer" -Beniko Suou?

121
00:08:22.857 --> 00:08:26.057
Thank you so much everyone for coming.

122
00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:31.857
"Kazuyo Inaba (40), Suou's Secretary"

123
00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:36.157
How do you like my precious collection?

124
00:08:37.057 --> 00:08:39.457
Yes. Well, I guess you could say so.

125
00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:42.457
You just mentioned the masks of Chableu,

126
00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:44.557
but are you refering to the masks covering the sides wall?

127
00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.157
Yes, it is said that the Spanish sculptor,

128
00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:50.657
Chableu Gonzales made it just before he died.

129
00:08:50.657 --> 00:08:53.057
It was the 200th mask that he made.

130
00:08:53.057 --> 00:08:56.257
It is also called "The cursed mask".

131
00:08:57.257 --> 00:08:58.957
Cursed mask?

132
00:08:58.957 --> 00:09:02.357
What is this cursed mask all about?

133
00:09:02.357 --> 00:09:05.857
Chableu Gonzales is a sculptor of tragedy.

134
00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:07.857
Although overflowing with talent,

135
00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:10.657
trapped by the jealousy of his brother,

136
00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:14.457
his fame, glory and estate were all taken away from him.

137
00:09:14.457 --> 00:09:17.457
Chableu who became very wary of people,

138
00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:21.357
began making masks as if obsessed by something.

139
00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:25.957
After finishing his 200th mask, he killed himself.

140
00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:28.257
The masks that were scattered around his body

141
00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:29.657
were splattered with blood.

142
00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:33.857
And the masks looked to have sucked the blood themselves.

143
00:09:33.857 --> 00:09:36.857
Since then, Chableu's reputation was restored,

144
00:09:36.857 --> 00:09:40.057
and his masks were handed down to various people.

145
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:45.057
However, many who owned the masks seemed to die tragic deaths.

146
00:09:45.057 --> 00:09:50.057
An English head of the bank fell off his horse

147
00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:53.257
the following day after getting hold of one of the masks, and died.

148
00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:57.657
A French jeweler was attacked by robbers and killed.

149
00:09:57.657 --> 00:09:59.857
And with the passing of time, this mask was called,

150
00:09:59.857 --> 00:10:03.257
"The cursed mask" that sips the blood of its owner,

151
00:10:03.257 --> 00:10:05.857
and was feared by people.

152
00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:09.757
Are you all right, owning all 200 of such masks?

153
00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:11.357
No need to worry.

154
00:10:11.357 --> 00:10:16.957
I had a great clairvoyant seal the curse in.

155
00:10:16.957 --> 00:10:20.457
It's starting to get more and more occult around here.

156
00:10:20.457 --> 00:10:22.357
But, Ms. Suou,

157
00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:25.357
the evil will of a living person

158
00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.257
may be even more frightening than a curse.

159
00:10:27.257 --> 00:10:29.257
Oh, what do you mean?

160
00:10:29.257 --> 00:10:31.957
Well, on our way here,

161
00:10:31.957 --> 00:10:33.357
out path was blocked by a fallen tree,

162
00:10:33.357 --> 00:10:35.357
and we found this pinned to the tree.

163
00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:36.557
Oh, my.

164
00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:41.657
Mr. Mouri, I received a similar sort of letter three days ago.

165
00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:43.957
I got one, too.

166
00:10:43.957 --> 00:10:45.257
Same here.

167
00:10:45.257 --> 00:10:47.057
What?

168
00:10:47.057 --> 00:10:49.457
It seems to be more than just a prank.

169
00:10:50.457 --> 00:10:52.957
A similar thing was sent to the agency as well.

170
00:10:52.957 --> 00:10:55.357
Touya, you're late.

171
00:10:55.357 --> 00:10:57.857
"Touya Aikawa (26)" -I'm right in the midst of a nationwide tour.

172
00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.357
"Rock Singer" -Give me a break for being tardy.

173
00:11:01.357 --> 00:11:04.957
-Who is he? -Conan, don't you know him?

174
00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:09.257
He's the most popular rock singer these days, Touya Aikawa.

175
00:11:09.257 --> 00:11:11.257
You received a strange letter?

176
00:11:11.257 --> 00:11:13.157
The name of the sender is not written.

177
00:11:13.157 --> 00:11:15.357
The lettering of the name of the addressee is also odd.

178
00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:21.157
It seems a ruler was used so that the handwriting cannot be identified.

179
00:11:21.157 --> 00:11:23.057
May I open it?

180
00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.557
Yes, please do.

181
00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:31.357
This is...

182
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:35.057
"The cursed mask will sip blood tonight.

183
00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:37.457
From the messenger of the cursed mask."

184
00:11:38.457 --> 00:11:41.757
Ms. Suou, you'd better call the police.

185
00:11:41.757 --> 00:11:44.557
There's nothing to worry about.

186
00:11:44.557 --> 00:11:46.657
Ever since I've started the charity show,

187
00:11:46.657 --> 00:11:49.957
I've been bothered by pranks like these.

188
00:11:54.857 --> 00:11:57.857
Yes, this stew is very delicious indeed.

189
00:11:57.857 --> 00:12:00.957
"Dining Room" -This wine sure is good, too!

190
00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:02.657
Talk about top class!

191
00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:06.657
Ladies and gentlemen, I am greatly thankful

192
00:12:06.657 --> 00:12:09.857
that you have all pleasantly accepted to appear as guests

193
00:12:09.857 --> 00:12:12.757
on the charity show that I will be hosting.

194
00:12:12.757 --> 00:12:16.157
Ms. Suou, may I ask you a question?

195
00:12:16.157 --> 00:12:17.557
What is it?

196
00:12:17.557 --> 00:12:19.757
How did you come across the idea of saving children

197
00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:23.357
whose parents who have become victims of traffic accidents?

198
00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:27.057
I started charity about 15 years ago.

199
00:12:27.057 --> 00:12:29.157
But, to tell the truth, five years before that,

200
00:12:29.157 --> 00:12:34.457
my manager caused a hit-and-run case.

201
00:12:34.457 --> 00:12:35.657
A hit-and-run?

202
00:12:35.657 --> 00:12:37.457
Yes. Ever since then,

203
00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:42.257
I could not stand being indifferent to traffic accidents.

204
00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:46.557
There are people saying that she is a publicity seeker,

205
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:49.357
but it's really not anything like that.

206
00:12:49.357 --> 00:12:52.557
What happened to the manager after the incident?

207
00:12:52.557 --> 00:12:53.657
She committed suicide.

208
00:12:53.657 --> 00:12:54.757
What?

209
00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:57.257
That manager happened to be my mother.

210
00:12:57.257 --> 00:12:58.857
Your mother?

211
00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:01.757
Since I lost my father at a young age,

212
00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:04.657
after my mother died, I was sent around to my relatives' homes.

213
00:13:04.657 --> 00:13:07.157
I really had it tough.

214
00:13:07.157 --> 00:13:11.257
But, Ms. Suou here helped me in every way she could.

215
00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:14.357
I'm what I am today, thanks to Ms. Suou.

216
00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:20.057
Touya's mother was more a cherished friend of mine than a manager.

217
00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:21.657
There are many at Kurenai Productions

218
00:13:21.657 --> 00:13:25.257
that have lost their families in traffic accidents.

219
00:13:25.257 --> 00:13:28.057
Ms. Suou is putting a lot of effort into helping the children

220
00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:30.057
of traffic accident victims, become independent.

221
00:13:31.157 --> 00:13:33.557
What a touching story!

222
00:13:33.557 --> 00:13:37.657
I'll cooperate as much as I can at your charity show next week.

223
00:13:37.657 --> 00:13:39.257
Same here.

224
00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:43.557
In fact, I lost my wife in a traffic accident 20 years ago.

225
00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:45.857
I'm sure that my wife in heaven is happy

226
00:13:45.857 --> 00:13:49.057
that I'm going to be taking part in Ms. Suou's charity show, too.

227
00:13:51.457 --> 00:13:53.357
"West Wing Third Floor" -I'd like you...

228
00:13:53.357 --> 00:13:56.257
"Suou's Living Quarters" -to investigate something for me, Mr. Mouri.

229
00:13:56.257 --> 00:13:57.757
Yes, I know.

230
00:13:57.757 --> 00:14:00.857
You'd like me to figure out the one who sent out those letters, right?

231
00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:02.157
No.

232
00:14:03.157 --> 00:14:07.557
Well, I wonder if you can check in detail

233
00:14:07.557 --> 00:14:10.357
on the traffic accident that took Mr. Katagiri's wife.

234
00:14:10.357 --> 00:14:11.957
Mr. Katagiri's wife?

235
00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:13.757
May I ask you why?

236
00:14:13.757 --> 00:14:16.257
There is something that bothers me.

237
00:14:16.257 --> 00:14:19.157
Would 2 million yen be enough to do it?

238
00:14:19.157 --> 00:14:20.757
2 million yen?

239
00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:23.757
I'd be more than glad to!

240
00:14:29.857 --> 00:14:31.757
You're pretty good, King of home runs.

241
00:14:31.757 --> 00:14:33.757
It's just luck.

242
00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:37.157
Conan, you're pretty good.

243
00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:41.757
Mr. Mouri, this year is a good year for you to begin something new.

244
00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:43.657
Really?

245
00:14:43.657 --> 00:14:45.557
Why then, Mr. Mouri.

246
00:14:45.557 --> 00:14:47.957
How about making a debut as a singer from our company?

247
00:14:48.957 --> 00:14:50.657
I'm sure it'll make a great hit

248
00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:53.657
if it is sung by the detectives of the Heisei Era, Kogoro Mouri!

249
00:14:53.657 --> 00:14:55.657
I guess I'll sing you a song then.

250
00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:57.457
We're sorry.

251
00:14:58.457 --> 00:15:01.657
Everyone, when the clock strikes midnight...

252
00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:05.157
We have a tradition of locking the door of the room of masks.

253
00:15:05.157 --> 00:15:06.457
When the door is locked,

254
00:15:06.457 --> 00:15:07.857
we will not be able to pass back and forth

255
00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:10.257
between the east and west wings.

256
00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:15.057
Therefore, we would like you to go into your rooms before that.

257
00:15:15.557 --> 00:15:19.657
You're kidding. Midnight is still too early to hit the sack.

258
00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:23.557
Is there a reason for locking the doors at midnight?

259
00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:25.957
They masks of Chableu like pranks

260
00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:28.457
and begin playing on their own come midnight.

261
00:15:28.457 --> 00:15:32.257
Therefore, we must lock the doors and keep them confined.

262
00:15:32.257 --> 00:15:34.257
That's ridiculous.

263
00:15:34.257 --> 00:15:35.757
It's true.

264
00:15:35.757 --> 00:15:38.957
Come morning the masks are tilted unnaturally...

265
00:15:38.957 --> 00:15:40.757
Or down on the floor.

266
00:15:40.757 --> 00:15:43.057
This has happened many times until now.

267
00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:47.557
Now, please go into your rooms, everyone.

268
00:15:49.257 --> 00:15:52.157
How occult can they get?

269
00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:50.666
"East Wing, Second Floor, Guest Room"

270
00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:54.766
His snoring is so noisy that I can't sleep.

271
00:16:58.066 --> 00:16:59.666
An extension phone?

272
00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:04.466
Who are you?

273
00:17:04.466 --> 00:17:06.966
Messenger of the cursed masks.

274
00:17:06.966 --> 00:17:09.366
Messenger of the cursed masks?

275
00:17:10.466 --> 00:17:11.666
Hand it over!

276
00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:12.666
Hey!

277
00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:15.466
The cursed masks are starving for blood.

278
00:17:15.466 --> 00:17:17.866
Who will be the sacrifice?

279
00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:18.966
What?

280
00:17:18.966 --> 00:17:21.366
You'd better hurry before it's too late.

281
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:23.866
That bastard!

282
00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:29.766
It's locked!

283
00:17:29.766 --> 00:17:33.266
Ran, Conan, wake Honami up and bring the key to this room!

284
00:17:33.266 --> 00:17:34.366
Okay!

285
00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:57.366
It's locked.

286
00:17:57.366 --> 00:17:59.466
The phone a while ago was from an extension phone.

287
00:17:59.466 --> 00:18:01.566
The person's in this mansion.

288
00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:05.766
Dad!

289
00:18:05.766 --> 00:18:07.166
Honami, please give me the key!

290
00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:08.266
All right.

291
00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:17.266
Oh, no.

292
00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:21.466
The masks of Chableu are gone!

293
00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:24.066
What is the meaning of this?

294
00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:29.166
What was that?

295
00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:30.866
It came from above.

296
00:18:30.866 --> 00:18:33.666
What? Ms. Suou's bedroom?

297
00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:36.766
You can't go that way!

298
00:18:38.466 --> 00:18:41.866
You have to take the stairs on the west side to get to her room.

299
00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:48.366
This door is locked, too.

300
00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:50.566
I'll wake Minaho and make her open the door!

301
00:18:50.566 --> 00:18:52.466
Hey, what on earth is this racket about?

302
00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:53.766
In the middle of the night.

303
00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.566
The masks of Chableu are gone.

304
00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:06.366
What on earth is going on?

305
00:19:14.566 --> 00:19:16.166
Ms. Suou! Ms. Suou!

306
00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:19.366
This door is locked, too!

307
00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.166
Crack that glass!

308
00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:26.466
Mr. Mouri, just what are you going to do?

309
00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:28.866
Is anything wrong with Ms. Suou?

310
00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:42.466
Hey, how's Ms. Suou?

311
00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:45.866
It seems that she's hurt. She bleeding badly!

312
00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:48.766
The masks of Chableu are scattered all over the room!

313
00:19:48.766 --> 00:19:50.366
The masks of Chableu?

314
00:19:51.966 --> 00:19:53.666
Are there any other entrances?

315
00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:56.566
There's another door over there.

316
00:19:56.566 --> 00:19:58.166
That door's no good.

317
00:19:58.166 --> 00:20:00.166
It's been sealed off for quite a while already.

318
00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:04.466
I'll go in from there and check out the inside.

319
00:20:05.466 --> 00:20:06.866
I guess there is no other choice.

320
00:20:09.066 --> 00:20:10.566
Dad, here you go.

321
00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:14.866
We're counting on you.

322
00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:23.666
The door is locked all right.

323
00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:25.066
It's a double lock, too.

324
00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:27.466
Hurry and go check on Ms. Suou!

325
00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:28.666
Yes.

326
00:20:35.866 --> 00:20:37.666
How is it?

327
00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:39.766
No good. It's too late.

328
00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:41.366
Darn.

329
00:20:42.766 --> 00:20:44.166
Ms. Suou...

330
00:20:56.766 --> 00:21:00.466
-Ms. Suou! -Don't come in. Please stay here.

331
00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:06.166
Slashed in the throat in one blow.

332
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:07.766
How cruel.

333
00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.566
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that this is murder?

334
00:21:10.566 --> 00:21:11.866
It can't be!

335
00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:13.966
The door was locked, wasn't it?

336
00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:17.766
From the looks of the corpse, suicide is impossible.

337
00:21:17.766 --> 00:21:19.566
But...

338
00:21:19.566 --> 00:21:22.766
My curse has been fulfilled.

339
00:21:22.766 --> 00:21:25.166
What was that?

340
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:27.566
This is a declaration that a murder will be committed.

341
00:21:27.566 --> 00:21:29.566
From the messenger of the cursed masks.

342
00:21:34.966 --> 00:21:36.066
It's a curse!

343
00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:37.866
The curse of the masks!

344
00:21:37.866 --> 00:21:41.066
She cursed to death by the masks!

345
00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:44.266
Ms. Suou was cursed to death by the masks?

346
00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:45.966
That's ridiculous.

347
00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:48.766
But, the scene of the crime is a locked room.

348
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:52.566
How on earth did the murderer kill Ms. Suou?

349
00:21:59.463 --> 00:22:01.963
The messenger of the cursed masks.

350
00:22:01.963 --> 00:22:03.263
Yes.

351
00:22:03.263 --> 00:22:05.663
Why didn't you report it to the police

352
00:22:05.663 --> 00:22:08.163
when you first found this letter?

353
00:22:08.163 --> 00:22:10.663
Well, the victim, Ms. Suou mentioned

354
00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:11.863
that she had been receiving similar pranks for some time,

355
00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:14.363
and to not worry about it.

356
00:22:14.763 --> 00:22:17.463
So, these are the cursed masks?

357
00:22:17.463 --> 00:22:18.463
Yes.

358
00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:23.263
We heard a groan and a loud crash.

359
00:22:23.263 --> 00:22:26.963
It could've been the sound of the killer scattering the masks.

360
00:22:26.963 --> 00:22:30.863
You said that this door was locked from inside?

361
00:22:30.863 --> 00:22:34.363
Yes, that's why I cracked the glass above the door,

362
00:22:34.363 --> 00:22:38.463
made Conan go inside and verified Ms. Suou's death.

363
00:22:38.463 --> 00:22:41.163
The door was definitely locked.

364
00:22:41.163 --> 00:22:42.463
Both two locks on the door.

365
00:22:42.463 --> 00:22:44.463
-Two locks? -Yes.

366
00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:47.863
Ms. Suou always locked both locks on her door.

367
00:22:47.863 --> 00:22:50.863
This door lock...

368
00:22:50.863 --> 00:22:53.963
and then this padlock.

369
00:22:53.963 --> 00:22:57.663
Why did the victim have two locks on her door?

370
00:22:57.663 --> 00:23:00.863
Well, according to her secretary, Ms. Inaba,

371
00:23:00.863 --> 00:23:02.363
when Ms. Suou went to have the curse of the masks

372
00:23:02.363 --> 00:23:04.063
sealed in by a clairvoyant,

373
00:23:04.063 --> 00:23:08.063
she was told to carry out several things.

374
00:23:08.063 --> 00:23:13.563
One of them was to put two locks on the bedroom door.

375
00:23:13.563 --> 00:23:15.763
A clairvoyant?

376
00:23:15.763 --> 00:23:19.263
Which means that the victim herself opened the door

377
00:23:19.263 --> 00:23:22.763
and let the victim in?

378
00:23:22.763 --> 00:23:25.163
Well, it doesn't seem so.

379
00:23:26.163 --> 00:23:28.563
It seems that Ms. Suou was suffering from insomnia lately,

380
00:23:28.563 --> 00:23:31.963
and was taking sleeping pills.

381
00:23:31.963 --> 00:23:35.763
That's why there were no traces of the victim had struggled?

382
00:23:35.763 --> 00:23:38.363
If the victim locked the door as usual,

383
00:23:38.363 --> 00:23:41.163
had sleeping pills and went to bed,

384
00:23:41.163 --> 00:23:43.563
how did the killer get into the room?

385
00:23:44.663 --> 00:23:46.363
What is this door?

386
00:23:46.363 --> 00:23:48.763
There is a bedroom next door too,

387
00:23:48.763 --> 00:23:52.263
but that door seems to have been closed off for many years.

388
00:23:52.263 --> 00:23:53.963
It seems to be nailed shut,

389
00:23:53.963 --> 00:23:56.663
and there are no traces of it having been opened.

390
00:23:56.663 --> 00:24:01.263
The railing above the door, is that bar removable?

391
00:24:01.263 --> 00:24:04.663
I checked on it, but it was not.

392
00:24:04.663 --> 00:24:06.663
The space between the bars is about 5 or 6 centimeters,

393
00:24:06.663 --> 00:24:09.163
so not even an arm can go through.

394
00:24:09.163 --> 00:24:10.863
How about that window on the other side?

395
00:24:10.863 --> 00:24:13.063
That window is fixed on.

396
00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:15.463
There is nothing abnormal about it.

397
00:24:15.463 --> 00:24:19.863
If so, how and where did the killer go in and out of this room?

398
00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:25.063
The only door that could be opened and shut was locked from the inside.

399
00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:28.263
The door to the bedroom next door is nailed and sealed.

400
00:24:28.263 --> 00:24:30.163
The space between the bars above it

401
00:24:30.163 --> 00:24:32.363
is so narrow that not even an arm can get through.

402
00:24:32.363 --> 00:24:34.063
The windows are both fixed on

403
00:24:34.063 --> 00:24:35.363
and there seems to be nothing wrong with them.

404
00:24:36.263 --> 00:24:39.063
It's also impossible for the victim herself to have opened the door

405
00:24:39.063 --> 00:24:41.863
and let the killer in, because she was under the effect of sleeping pills.

406
00:24:41.863 --> 00:24:45.663
The room is a locked room where you can't get in or get out of.

407
00:24:45.663 --> 00:24:49.263
I wonder if Ms. Suou really drank the sleeping pill herself?

408
00:24:50.263 --> 00:24:52.863
If she didn't drink it herself, who would make her...

409
00:24:53.863 --> 00:24:54.963
Wait a sec.

410
00:24:54.963 --> 00:24:57.063
I've got it, inspector!

411
00:24:57.063 --> 00:24:59.263
What? Is that true?

412
00:24:59.263 --> 00:25:01.563
The killer met Ms. Suou in the middle of the night,

413
00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:03.963
made her drink something with a sleeping pill in it,

414
00:25:03.963 --> 00:25:05.263
put her to sleep.

415
00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:07.563
Then, the killer carries Ms. Suou to her bed on the bed

416
00:25:07.563 --> 00:25:08.763
and kills her there.

417
00:25:08.763 --> 00:25:09.863
I see.

418
00:25:09.863 --> 00:25:13.863
And, how did the killer lock the door when leaving the room?

419
00:25:13.863 --> 00:25:16.363
That? Well...

420
00:25:16.363 --> 00:25:18.363
I don't know just yet.

421
00:25:19.463 --> 00:25:20.663
Yes.

422
00:25:20.663 --> 00:25:24.663
Only half of the locked room mystery can be explained.

423
00:25:24.663 --> 00:25:29.663
The door is the only possible way that the killer could've come in from,

424
00:25:29.663 --> 00:25:32.963
but how on earth did the killer lock the door from the outside?

425
00:25:32.963 --> 00:25:34.663
If the lock were just a handle that could be turned,

426
00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:37.363
then using a string or something may unlock it.

427
00:25:37.363 --> 00:25:39.663
But, the padlock is the problem.

428
00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:42.163
In order to lock this, the door has to be closed first.

429
00:25:42.163 --> 00:25:45.463
Then the door and the metal piece on the door frame has to be matched.

430
00:25:45.463 --> 00:25:47.463
Only after doing so, can the pole

431
00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:50.663
be stuck into the two metal fixtures.

432
00:25:50.663 --> 00:25:55.063
I feel that it is impossible to do all this from outside the door.

433
00:25:55.063 --> 00:25:58.963
What kind of trick did the killer use anyway?

434
00:25:58.963 --> 00:26:00.963
No matter what trick the killer used,

435
00:26:00.963 --> 00:26:02.963
why didn't the killer make it look like a suicide,

436
00:26:02.963 --> 00:26:06.963
after doing all this to kill her?

437
00:26:07.663 --> 00:26:10.663
The killer called our room just before the murder was committed.

438
00:26:11.663 --> 00:26:14.363
As if to let us know beforehand that murder was going to take place.

439
00:26:15.263 --> 00:26:17.463
This knife seems to be the murder weapon.

440
00:26:17.463 --> 00:26:20.663
This is what was decorated in the room of the masks.

441
00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:25.263
It was poked into the bed pole, but there's something odd.

442
00:26:25.263 --> 00:26:29.463
As you can see, the handle of it is also smeared with blood.

443
00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.463
It sure is odd.

444
00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:35.463
If the killer is holding the handle, there should be no blood there.

445
00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:36.663
Talking of blood,

446
00:26:36.663 --> 00:26:41.163
there were masks among the masks that were scattered on the floor

447
00:26:41.163 --> 00:26:43.063
with blood splattered on them, too.

448
00:26:44.363 --> 00:26:47.063
This was found on the bed.

449
00:26:47.063 --> 00:26:50.363
It seems to have been splattered with blood at close range.

450
00:26:50.363 --> 00:26:53.163
I think that the killer was wearing this mask

451
00:26:53.163 --> 00:26:54.563
when committing the murder.

452
00:26:54.563 --> 00:26:59.763
If so, there may be some traces of the killer left.

453
00:26:59.763 --> 00:27:02.563
Are there other masks that have been splattered with blood?

454
00:27:02.563 --> 00:27:05.463
Yes, but it's quite strange.

455
00:27:06.463 --> 00:27:11.363
All the other masks had blood only around the mouth.

456
00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.963
There is a spook story concerning the masks

457
00:27:13.963 --> 00:27:18.163
that says the masks sip the blood of the people who own them.

458
00:27:18.163 --> 00:27:20.763
Don't be silly.

459
00:27:20.763 --> 00:27:23.063
Could the killer have scattered the masks

460
00:27:23.063 --> 00:27:27.263
to confuse investigations with occult stories?

461
00:27:27.263 --> 00:27:29.763
That's most likely.

462
00:27:29.763 --> 00:27:33.863
I wonder if that's the only reason why the killer scattered the masks?

463
00:27:33.863 --> 00:27:36.963
No, I'm sure there is some other reason.

464
00:27:36.963 --> 00:27:38.363
If I could only figure that out...

465
00:27:38.363 --> 00:27:39.563
Inspector!

466
00:27:39.563 --> 00:27:42.463
Officer Kobayashi, how was it?

467
00:27:42.463 --> 00:27:45.363
We checked every nook and cranny surrounding the mansion,

468
00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.263
but maybe because of the snow that has accumulated,

469
00:27:47.263 --> 00:27:50.463
there are no signs of the killer has gone in or out.

470
00:27:50.463 --> 00:27:52.563
Which means that the killer is...

471
00:27:52.563 --> 00:27:55.063
A person that is within the mansion.

472
00:27:55.063 --> 00:27:56.763
Aside from Mr. Mouri and his family,

473
00:27:56.763 --> 00:27:58.763
those who were in this mansion are

474
00:27:58.763 --> 00:28:01.163
the photographer, Masanori Katagiri,

475
00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:04.763
pro baseball player, Mamoru Matsudaira,

476
00:28:05.763 --> 00:28:08.263
popular Fortune-teller, Haruka Nagara,

477
00:28:09.263 --> 00:28:11.663
rock singer, Touya Aikawa,

478
00:28:12.663 --> 00:28:14.963
the victim's secretary, Kazuyo Inaba,

479
00:28:15.863 --> 00:28:18.863
and the twin maids, Minaho and Honami Shimogasa.

480
00:28:19.763 --> 00:28:21.863
A total of 7 people.

481
00:28:21.863 --> 00:28:24.963
We can narrow down the suspects a bit more.

482
00:28:24.963 --> 00:28:26.263
What do you mean?

483
00:28:26.763 --> 00:28:29.463
You can't get to Ms. Suou's bedroom which is on the 3rd floor,

484
00:28:29.463 --> 00:28:32.363
without using the stairs of the west wing.

485
00:28:32.363 --> 00:28:34.163
At the time of the incident,

486
00:28:34.163 --> 00:28:37.663
the doors leading to the east and west wings were both locked.

487
00:28:37.663 --> 00:28:39.663
This has already been verified.

488
00:28:39.663 --> 00:28:42.563
In other words, you couldn't pass from the east wing

489
00:28:42.563 --> 00:28:44.263
to the west wing at that time.

490
00:28:44.263 --> 00:28:46.363
Which means that the killer is someone

491
00:28:46.363 --> 00:28:48.363
who was in the west wing of the mansion.

492
00:28:48.363 --> 00:28:50.563
Who were in what rooms?

493
00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:52.263
First, on the 1st floor of the east wing,

494
00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.963
were Mr. Aikawa and Honami.

495
00:28:53.963 --> 00:28:56.663
In the west wing were Ms. Inaba and Minaho.

496
00:28:56.663 --> 00:28:59.063
On the 2nd floor east wing were we three.

497
00:28:59.063 --> 00:29:01.563
In the west wing, were Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira

498
00:29:01.563 --> 00:29:03.363
and Haruka.

499
00:29:03.363 --> 00:29:04.863
I see.

500
00:29:04.863 --> 00:29:06.863
There are five suspects.

501
00:29:06.863 --> 00:29:10.263
Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira, Ms. Nagara,

502
00:29:10.263 --> 00:29:12.763
Ms. Inaba and Minaho.

503
00:29:12.763 --> 00:29:16.163
Yes, the messenger of the cursed masks

504
00:29:16.163 --> 00:29:18.363
are among the five.
