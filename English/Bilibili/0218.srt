1
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.032
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:22.832
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:24.732
The contents of the hat will finally be disclosed.

4
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:26.632
The mistake that Inspector Megure had made.

5
00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.232
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:30.132
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:32.132
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:56.991
We accompanied Sonoko to the department store

9
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.991
because she wanted to go shopping.

10
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:03.991
However, Pops gets messed up in the decoy investigation

11
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:07.991
that Inspector Megure and the others have set up.

12
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:10.391
The inspector and the others were in the midst of

13
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:12.991
investigating a serial woman attacker case.

14
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.091
Just at that time, Ran finds the dead body of a woman

15
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.091
in the basement parking of the department store!

16
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:29.591
Inspector Megure and the other officers carry out their investigation,

17
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:32.591
but it seems that Inspector Megure is not acting his usual self.

18
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.991
Superintendent. Please let me stay and investigate a bit further!

19
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.891
I know I'm close to getting somewhere!

20
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:45.191
Besides, I have this feeling that the culprit is still somewhere nearby.

21
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:47.791
Well...

22
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.191
Inspector Megure.

23
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.191
Don't tell me that

24
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:57.891
you're not dragging the you know what case inside of you yet?

25
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:03.391
That case that you sealed up inside that hat of yours.

26
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:11.691
"Inspector Megure's Sealed Secret (Part 2)"

27
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:29.191
Mr. Mouri?

28
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:30.891
Please lend me the key to the car.

29
00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.791
I guess it'll take a while longer

30
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:34.391
so I'm going to go put the things in the car

31
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.291
and then go to the restroom.

32
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:41.291
You'd better hurry because it's almost closing time.

33
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.291
Thank you.

34
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:43.691
Take this too, please.

35
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.291
Okay!

36
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.491
There it is!

37
00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:53.791
This is it over here!

38
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.791
Gosh, what's with this car anyway?

39
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.491
What a way to park!

40
00:03:58.491 --> 00:04:01.191
I can't even open the door!

41
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:02.691
Gosh!

42
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:09.591
There we go!

43
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:15.891
Inspector! It's been confirmed!

44
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:16.991
And?

45
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.391
That woman did get off the car after all

46
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.591
and go to the restroom in the park.

47
00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:23.891
I see!

48
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:25.991
I don't understand it.

49
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:28.691
Why would the culprit want to go after

50
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:30.091
modern type girls who are riding cars?

51
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:32.491
Is he after something else or some other thing

52
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:35.791
that the four victims have in common?

53
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:38.891
"Closed for cleaning" -You've got to be kidding.

54
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.091
This one's being cleaned too.

55
00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:44.891
Why don't they clean the restrooms after the department is closed?

56
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:48.191
The next closest restroom is on the eighth floor.

57
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:51.491
I guess I don't jive with restrooms.

58
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.991
Thank you very much for your patronage.

59
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.291
We will be closing in a few minutes.

60
00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.591
Your continued patronage is most welcomed.

61
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.691
Oh, no. This can't be happening.

62
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:04.891
We're carrying the corpse out.

63
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:14.391
Hey! Watch her foot!

64
00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:16.391
Sorry!

65
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:23.391
What? This shoe is too big for her.

66
00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:25.391
Ran!

67
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.591
The thing that you were saying about something being strange.

68
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:29.991
Is it...

69
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:33.691
Right, that's it!

70
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:37.591
All tanned dark and dressed like that is absolutely outrageous.

71
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.091
If so, don't tell me that the culprit is...

72
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.991
Hey... don't turn the lights out on me.

73
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:55.391
I'm still here.

74
00:05:57.091 --> 00:06:00.391
Hey, is anybody around?

75
00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:05.491
"Haido Department Store"

76
00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:06.591
What?

77
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.991
High soled boots?

78
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.791
Are you saying that the victim, Ms. Aizawa,

79
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.491
who was killed in this parking lot

80
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.291
was actually wearing high soled boots?

81
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.691
Yes! Girls who are tanned dark and wearing such flashy clothes

82
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:21.891
would never wear such regular low heeled slip on.

83
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.891
Right, Ran?

84
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:30.291
But why did the culprit go out of his way to change her shoes?

85
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.291
He didn't want anyone to notice.

86
00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:36.091
That he was going around attacking

87
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:39.691
only drivers who are wearing high soled shoes!

88
00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.491
What?

89
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:46.891
Come to think of it, the other three victims were also tanned dark

90
00:06:46.891 --> 00:06:49.491
and wearing flashy clothes when they were attacked.

91
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:52.491
Which means that it is very likely that

92
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.291
they were also wearing high soled boots!

93
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.691
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:59.191
If it's related to high soled boots,

95
00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:03.191
one of the causes that Ms. Aizawa got into that traffic accident a year ago

96
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:07.491
was that she was wearing high soled boots when she's driving.

97
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:11.491
Yumi told me that she couldn't hit the brakes fast enough because of it.

98
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:13.291
Is that true?

99
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:17.791
Yes! The late boys divorced parents

100
00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:20.191
strongly insisted that it was the reason,

101
00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:22.191
but it wasn't acknowledged after all.

102
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.191
His parents were divorced?

103
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:26.891
Yes, the reason was because his father used to get violent

104
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.991
under the influence of alcohol.

105
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.691
If I remember correctly the father's name was...

106
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:35.691
Sadakane, maybe?

107
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:37.691
Right... it was that sort of name!

108
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:39.691
Wait a minute!

109
00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:42.291
The name of the security guard that we talked to a while ago

110
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.691
was also Sadakane.

111
00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:46.691
Hey! Don't tell me the culprit is...

112
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:48.691
that security guard?

113
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:54.891
Takagi, go and check on the case a year ago!

114
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.691
-Yes, sir! -You guys go and look for security guard Sadakane!

115
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:00.591
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

116
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.991
How'd you ever figure it out?

117
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:05.191
It was really easy.

118
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:07.691
Because the culprit is after people

119
00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:10.991
who are wearing high soled boots, right?

120
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.991
You can't tell if the person is wearing that kind of shoes from outside,

121
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:17.491
and the ones attacked were all customers of this department store.

122
00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:20.491
So, it had to be somebody who could watch the customers

123
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.191
gets in and out of their cars in this parking lot.

124
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:25.491
The only person that I could think of as suspicious was the security guard!

125
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:30.191
But, the victims all testified that

126
00:08:30.191 --> 00:08:32.391
the culprit was about 150 cm!

127
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:37.291
That security guard said he was 167 cm!

128
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:39.891
Come on! You are acting again!

129
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.891
All the women who were attacked

130
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:46.191
only said that the culprit was about their height.

131
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.991
So, if the women were wearing boots that were more than 10 cm high,

132
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:53.491
I know that you already realise that 10 cm more have to be added on

133
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.591
to the culprit's height!

134
00:08:57.191 --> 00:09:00.391
I see, we measured their height

135
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:02.291
when they came to headquarters.

136
00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.391
Since they were summoned for interrogation,

137
00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:07.491
they probably avoided wearing high soled boots and flashy clothes.

138
00:09:07.491 --> 00:09:10.691
But if the culprit wanted to avenge his son's death,

139
00:09:10.691 --> 00:09:12.691
why didn't he go directly to her house

140
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:14.891
than ambush her in a place like this?

141
00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:17.591
Did you forget, Mr. Mouri?

142
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:20.291
The victim is 20 years old, isn't she?

143
00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:24.291
At the time of the accident, she was still under age, wasn't she?

144
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:27.591
The address of a juvenile is not publicised.

145
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:30.891
That's probably why he waited for her here,

146
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:32.691
where his son was run over.

147
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:37.691
He believe that the victim will come to this department store again.

148
00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:41.291
I guess he got agitated because she didn't show up.

149
00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:43.991
So, he decided to attack women drivers wearing high soled boots

150
00:09:43.991 --> 00:09:46.991
just to vent out the anger he had within him.

151
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.891
Inspector! I've got what we need!

152
00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:57.991
That security guard is the father of the boy

153
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.791
who died of the traffic accident a year ago, after all!

154
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.891
And, where is he now?

155
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:05.591
Well, his car is in this parking lot,

156
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:07.391
but he's nowhere in sight.

157
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.991
What's up, Ran?

158
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:15.691
Sonoko's not back yet.

159
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:17.191
She said that she was going to take her things to the car,

160
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:19.691
then go to the restroom, but...

161
00:10:19.691 --> 00:10:21.591
Her things to the car?

162
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:24.891
Hey, if I'm not mistaken, Sonoko was wearing high soled boots.

163
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:32.091
Hello?

164
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:33.291
Ran?

165
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:36.691
Now? I'm still in the department store.

166
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.191
Listen to this, it's unacceptable.

167
00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:43.191
I know I was taking my time in the restroom,

168
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:45.391
but the nerve of them to turn the lights off on me.

169
00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:04.091
What is it? Is something the matter, Sonoko?

170
00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:06.991
No, it's nothing.

171
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:09.691
I just thought I sensed something strange.

172
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.980
No!

173
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.680
She saw me...

174
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.280
She saw my face?

175
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.280
Hey, Sonoko? Sonoko?

176
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.880
He's made a mistake!

177
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.980
He's mistaken Sonoko for a driver wearing high soled boots

178
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.280
because she had the keys to the car

179
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.580
and was putting her things in the car!

180
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580
What?

181
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.580
Where did she say she is now?

182
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.580
She said she is in the department store.

183
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.780
Was the phone cut off?

184
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.580
No, it's still connected

185
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.580
but I hear a computer-like voice in the distance.

186
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.280
Computer-like voice?

187
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.880
Please choose the frame of your choice.

188
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.280
Push the button after you take a pose!

189
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.180
It's a picture taking machine!

190
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.580
Is there a picture taking machine in this department store?

191
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.380
Yes, there is!

192
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.580
I'm sure there were two machines

193
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.480
by the stairs of the restaurant arcade on the 10th floor.

194
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.580
I see!

195
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.280
Even though the lower floors are closed,

196
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.480
the restaurants close late.

197
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.380
So, Sonoko must've tried to get down using the elevator there.

198
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.180
Okay! Takagi, you go get the lights turned on!

199
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.480
Megure and Sato,

200
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.280
go around to the top with the elevator,

201
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.080
and the others go from below to the top and take custody of the girl,

202
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.880
as well as nab the suspect!

203
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880
Yes, sir...

204
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.280
Hey! Out of the way! Move!

205
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.480
Inspector Megure is really into this case.

206
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.780
They're very similar.

207
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.580
This case is very similar to the first case that he handled.

208
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.080
Where is your daughter and the boy wearing glasses?

209
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080
What?

210
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.880
There it is!

211
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.180
This is hers!

212
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.980
It's unmistakably Sonoko's cell phone!

213
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.180
The customers at the restaurant arcade don't seem to have seen Sonoko,

214
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.980
so she must've run into the department store.

215
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.980
Hey, Takagi! Can't you get the lights on yet?

216
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.780
You guys are devils!

217
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.780
Moreover,

218
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.880
you're devils pretending to be cute girls while committing crime.

219
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.880
Devils don't deserve to live!

220
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.280
What's happening?

221
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.980
-A black out? -Darn! Why at a time like this?

222
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.880
Sonoko.

223
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.280
Sonoko, where are you?

224
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.480
Sonoko!

225
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.480
Quiet!

226
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.980
It's the sound of a lot of something falling to the ground!

227
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.980
Sand, grains...

228
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.780
No, something bigger.

229
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.280
I think it's the sound of the pebbles

230
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.280
that are used on the floor of aquariums.

231
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.280
The pet shop is on the fourth floor.

232
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.080
She's on the fourth floor, then!

233
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.580
Let's hurry!

234
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.080
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.980
All I wanted to do was teach you a lesson.

236
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.080
But, you saw me, didn't you?

237
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.480
You saw my face.

238
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.580
Sonoko...

239
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.780
It's strange. Nobody's in the pet shop!

240
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.580
Sonoko!

241
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.780
It's strange, nothing is broken, nor is anything on the floor!

242
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.180
Don't tell me that the sound we just heard was...

243
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.880
You saw my face, didn't you?

244
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.180
Inspector.

245
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.680
How?

246
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.580
Do you feel good?

247
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.480
I'm asking you if you feel good about hurting people.

248
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.180
You may be thinking that you are flinging that metal bat of justice

249
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.280
upon young drivers with bad manners,

250
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.680
but unfortunately, she is just a high school girl

251
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.580
who was putting her things in the car.

252
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.180
What you're doing is not for justice

253
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.980
or for the sake of your late son.

254
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.780
It's just an act of unjustified resentment based on misunderstanding!

255
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.580
You took the lives of people who had nothing to do with the case

256
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.880
just for your own satisfaction,

257
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.380
in order to amuse yourself and distract yourself from your grief!

258
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.580
Don't you see what you're doing?

259
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.480
All I wanted was for that woman to apologise.

260
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.780
For her to wear normal shoes

261
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.080
and apologise to my son up in heaven.

262
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.880
I just wanted her to apologise.

263
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.880
That's really how I felt in the beginning.

264
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.480
It's true.

265
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.880
Sonoko!

266
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.880
Ran...

267
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.780
Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

268
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.980
No! I was so scared!

269
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.980
Inspector! How you figured out where she was?

270
00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.480
Well...

271
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.580
This lead me here.

272
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.580
This "go" stone.

273
00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.080
Inspector! Are you all right?

274
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.280
No need for worry.

275
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.680
It's just that the old wound opened up again.

276
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.680
The old wound that I was supposed to have left back way in the past.

277
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880
"Midoridai Police Hospital" -What?

278
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.780
An old wound that he got from a case in the past?

279
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.580
Yes, Megure wears the hat

280
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.580
in order to hide the old wound that he got in the past.

281
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.280
But, isn't a wound equivalent to a medal of award for an officer?

282
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.480
Why should he hide it?

283
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.480
It's been more than 20 years ago.

284
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.480
Yes, it was back then

285
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.980
when Megure had just become a police detective.

286
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.680
I take it you all know about

287
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.980
the case of high school girls being run over, the hit-and-run case.

288
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.480
Yes!

289
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.280
The motive of the criminal was the grudge that he held towards

290
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.480
the delinquent high school girls who blackmailed him for money.

291
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.580
What the criminal did was catch the girls alone

292
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.580
and run them over with his car. Totally outrageous.

293
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.280
Back then, the fad among delinquent high school girls

294
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.580
were skirts worn long below their knees.

295
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.580
He went and ran over every such girl he saw.

296
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.480
At first, he just bumped into them and fled,

297
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.280
but his actions eventually escalated,

298
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.980
and a victim ended up being killed.

299
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.280
Therefore, we warned the high school girls in the vicinity

300
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.280
not to wear skirts like those when going out.

301
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.580
No more cases were reported after that.

302
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.580
However, one day, a high school girl

303
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.280
came up saying that she would like to act as decoy,

304
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.180
so that she could avenge the death of her friend.

305
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.980
Of course we turned her offer down.

306
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.580
But, we had no way of stopping the girl

307
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.280
who had her doubts about the police either.

308
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.980
Therefore, we had Megure watch over her.

309
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.580
The criminal tried to run over her as well as Megure.

310
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.580
Fortunately, Inspector Megure remembered the license plate number.

311
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.880
Although the criminal was caught, but he paid a large price in return.

312
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.280
Although Megure got away with a wound on his head,

313
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.480
the girl slammed her body and head hard against the pavement,

314
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.480
and by the time we got to the scene,

315
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.480
she was covered with blood and totally wasted.

316
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.780
Then, the reason why the inspector doesn't take off his hat is...

317
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.480
Yes, that's right.

318
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.480
It's because most surely anybody would ask him

319
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.280
how he got the large wound on his head if they saw it.

320
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.680
And, each time, he'd have to recall the incident back then.

321
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.580
That's why Megure sealed off the wound with his hat.

322
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.980
That old wound packed with bad memories.

323
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.380
That's why the inspector was so much against the decoy idea.

324
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.880
He doesn't want to let the decoy to be sacrificed again.

325
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.180
Hey...

326
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.880
Although the girl was badly hurt, but she didn't die.

327
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.680
After all, she's Megure's...

328
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.880
Oh, Superintendent Matsumoto.

329
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.880
You've come to visit too.

330
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.880
"Megure's Wife" -Officer Takagi and Shiratori just left.

331
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.880
So they've also come!

332
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.880
Yes, they've all come between working hours.

333
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.180
She has a wound on her forehead?

334
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.480
Don't tell me that...

335
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.280
Hey, Midori. Will you peel an apple for me?

336
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.880
Gosh, he is so spoiled regardless of his age.

337
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.580
I guess I'll go blast him one so that he shapes up

338
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.480
and gets back to work as soon as possible.

339
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.880
Yes, by all means.

340
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.980
Come to think of it, I've heard that Inspector Megure's wife

341
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.280
used to be a delinquent before.

342
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.180
Maybe the reason he never takes off his hat is because...

343
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.180
He doesn't want to be teased about his first encounter with his wife.

344
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.480
Hey! What's taking you so long?

345
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.180
"Next Episode" -You're looking for

346
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.780
a Jr. High School classmate?

347
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.780
If he was that strong when he was in the 8th grade,

348
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.980
he must be participating in some tournament even now.

349
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.880
He is holding something in his right hand?

350
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.280
This is...

351
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.680
What I can't make out is this lady who is full of lies.

352

A mysterious lady makes an appearance in the next episode.
