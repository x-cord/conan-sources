1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.300
Sera suspects that Haibara may
have been turned into a child

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.690
and is trying to get close to her.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.630
In order to dodge her investigation,

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.210
we accepted Professor Agasa's invitation to
visit an antique appraiser along with Subaru-san.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160
However...

6
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.310
Nishitsu-san.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.730
Nishitsu-san?

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.170
What happened?

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.240
Who did this to you?

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.500
Th-This...

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.400
This is the real tray...

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.010
Wh-What's this?

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.650
A crane design?

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.940
In any case, we need to call
an ambulance and the police.

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.440
Oh, no. My phone is in my car.

16
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.880
Nishitsu-san, wait here. I'll be right back.

17
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.200
That's the room.

18
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.620
What's this?

19
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.280
It's no use. He's dead.

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.930
Hey, Conan-kun.

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.640
I don't see a tray anywhere.

22
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.340
What?

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.880
What's going on here?

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
Let's begin by checking the back of
the tray inside Tojima-san's box.

25
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.080
Naturally, whoever owns the bloody
tray will become our prime suspect.

26
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.130
There's blood on this.

27
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.980
What?

28
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.290
Tojima Motoyuki (41)
Securities Company Employee
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President
Sakamaki Suzue (46)
Art Museum Director

29
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.280
Tojima Motoyuki (41)
Securities Company Employee
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President
Sakamaki Suzue (46)
Art Museum Director
I see. So you're the culprit.

30
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.460
I see. So you're the culprit.

31
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.870
N-No! It wasn't me!

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.870
Now, now. Just to be sure,
let's look at the other two trays.

33
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.250
Whoa, whoa.

34
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.710
There's blood on the
backs of all three trays.

35
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.600
What's going on here?

36
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.120
Well, uh...

37
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.560
The culprit probably noticed the
blood on the back of the tray,

38
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.940
and used quick thinking to put the same
bloody mark on the other two trays.

39
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.470
So we wouldn't know which
one is the real tray.

40
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.130
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

41
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.400
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

42
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.220
Three bloodstains conceal the real tray!

43
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.510
As the truth approaches,
new mysteries appear!

44
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.090
Always determining the one truth

45
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.080
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

46
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.570
his name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.570
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part Three)

48
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.660
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part Three)
"The Antique Tray Can't
Be Hidden, Part Three!"

49
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.980
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part Three)

50
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.480
Hey, you.

51
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.610
Making us stay here won't get you anywhere.

52
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.640
B-But...

53
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.780
I'm leaving.

54
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.530
You can't leave.

55
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.750
Judging by the situation,

56
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.620
it's likely that one of you struck Nishitsu-san
the appraiser on the head with a spear,

57
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.050
and used that same spear to stab
him in the back and kill him.

58
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.930
We'd like you to stay a little longer.

59
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.930
How much longer?

60
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.690
How are you going to find the culprit when
none of the appraisers can make it here?

61
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.850
We're currently reaching out to
appraisers from other prefectures.

62
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.190
If you could wait just a little longer...

63
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.200
Inspector Megure.

64
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.580
According to the housekeepers,

65
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.710
the victim said he wanted to see the
shocked expressions on his clients' faces

66
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.210
when he showed them this parcel
during his explanation.

67
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.590
Perhaps his explanation on
the trays is written on it.

68
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.340
There certainly seems to
be something written on it.

69
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.730
But it's written so beautifully
that it's illegible.

70
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.730
That's the box for the dish
I asked him to appraise.

71
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.420
Box for a dish?

72
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.490
Yeah. The surface with
writing on it is the lid.

73
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.430
You can open it by sliding it upwards.

74
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.160
L-Like this?

75
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.430
You're right. There's an antique dish inside.

76
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.580
Excuse me.

77
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.480
May I take a look?

78
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.620
Sure. From the looks of it, it
doesn't seem connected to the case.

79
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.720
Thank you.

80
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.350
Huh?

81
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.720
There's some paint missing
on the back of the dish.

82
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.850
It looks like there are cracks
on the bare spot, too.

83
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.060
That's odd.

84
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.960
When I found it, the
paint wasn't peeling off.

85
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.490
That's it!

86
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080
Hey, Professor.

87
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.750
Huh?

88
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.490
When you flipped over the tray, what was the
orientation of the crane carved onto the front?

89
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.500
The orientation of the crane?

90
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.140
I think it was like this.

91
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.270
Hey, Detective Takagi. Try
flipping their trays over again.

92
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.520
What? Again?

93
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.030
Yeah. Flip them over sideways
like you did before.

94
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.300
Okay, I flipped them over.

95
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.790
Also, Detective Chiba.

96
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.040
What is it, Conan-kun?

97
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.900
On the cushions inside the boxes...

98
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.470
Yeah, there was one.

99
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.720
There was one box that
had a bloodstain there.

100
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.720
I see.

101
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.340
So that's how it is.

102
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.980
I can't stand this any longer.

103
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.320
Staying at the crime scene
is giving me the creeps.

104
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.740
Just look at the tatami mat.

105
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.740
The blood splatter reaches our boxes.

106
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.780
We can put our trays back in
our boxes and leave now, right?

107
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.750
You can finish questioning us another day.

108
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.280
Please wait a little longer.

109
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.670
An appraiser who knows a fair bit
about antiques is on their way.

110
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.470
"Knows a fair bit?" You can't be serious.

111
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.160
If the tray inside our box
is determined to be real,

112
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.230
we'll be suspected of murdering
Nishitsu-san, right?

113
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.720
Such an important responsibility can't be
trusted to someone who isn't an expert.

114
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.020
I agree.

115
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:38.040
Though I'd never kill someone to get
my hands on a real black lacquer tray.

116
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.990
Hey, you guys.

117
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:47.500
What if I told you I could tell the real tray
apart from the fakes without an appraiser?

118
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.880
What?

119
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.280
Remember what you said
earlier, Professor Agasa?

120
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.640
After being struck on the head with a spear,

121
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.090
Nishitsu Hogen-san pointed at the
real tray with his bloody hand.

122
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.520
Y-Yeah.

123
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.520
Nishitsu-san left a bloody
fingerprint on the tray.

124
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:12.450
When you flipped the tray over sideways,
there was a crane pattern on the front,

125
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.660
and its beak was pointing in the same
direction as the bloody fingerprint.

126
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.160
Y-Yeah. That's what I thought, anyway.

127
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.410
But we just finished checking that.

128
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:30.530
We turned each tray so the bloodstain was
pointing straight up and flipped them over sideways,

129
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.720
but none of the cranes' beaks
were pointing straight up.

130
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.290
Then let's check it again.

131
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.640
When you flipped over the tray, the
bloodstain was pointing northeast,

132
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.480
or at 1:30 on a clock face, right?

133
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.980
That's right.

134
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.360
Could you flip the trays over
again based on that information?

135
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.780
This time rotate the trays so
the blood is pointing at 1:30.

136
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.030
And when you flip them over sideways...

137
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.190
That's right. When the trays
are flipped over sideways,

138
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.510
the only crane with a beak pointing at 1:30

139
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.350
is on the tray inside your box!

140
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.670
That's right. When the trays
are flipped over sideways,

141
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.780
the only crane with a beak pointing at 1:30

142
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.530
is on the tray inside your box!

143
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.630
Tojima Motoyuki-san!

144
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.470
But why?

145
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:53.110
Earlier none of the cranes' beaks pointed
in the same direction as the blood.

146
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.300
That's because the trays were rotated
so the blood was pointing straight up.

147
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.820
When a plate-like object with
a mark is flipped over sideways

148
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.100
and there's a mark in the
same spot on the back,

149
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.700
we tend to think the marks are in the same
place on the front and back of the plate,

150
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.630
but that's only true when
mark is at the very top.

151
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.780
Before the professor flipped over the tray,

152
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.790
the bloodstain was pointing
northeast, or at 1:30 on a clock,

153
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.140
so unless the crane's beak was
pointing at 10:30, or northwest,

154
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.280
it wouldn't end up in the same
spot when it was flipped over.

155
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.960
That's why the crane's beak
wasn't pointing straight up

156
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.840
when we flipped over trays with
bloodstains pointing straight up.

157
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.460
I see.

158
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.280
Then it was Tojima Motoyuki-san who stabbed
Nishitsu-san to death with a spear

159
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.100
and swapped his own tray
out for the real one.

160
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.480
Wh-Why would you assume that?

161
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.000
Apparently Nishitsu-san told that Agasa
fellow that "this is the real tray."

162
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.280
We don't know whether the
culprit overheard that or not.

163
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:11.230
It's possible that they simply put
matching bloodstains on all the trays

164
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.760
and returned them to their boxes in
order to throw off the investigation.

165
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.540
S-So the real tray was in my box because mine

166
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.540
happened to be the real
one in the first place.

167
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.300
Hey, don't go making up nonsense.

168
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.420
Don't be so unreasonably stubborn.

169
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.520
But...

170
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.930
That's right.

171
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.680
You're being really stubborn, mister.

172
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.690
What?

173
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.440
After all, the other two
couldn't have done it.

174
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.940
Wh-What do you mean, Conan-kun?

175
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:47.490
The culprit struck the appraiser on the
head with that long heavy spear, right?

176
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.330
Yeah.

177
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.530
The old man and woman aren't strong enough.

178
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.930
If they tried to lift that heavy spear,

179
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.340
they would've staggered, causing the
tatami mat to make a creaking sound.

180
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.710
Nishitsu-san would've noticed.

181
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.710
A sound?

182
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.310
Don't you think so?

183
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.120
Maybe, but...

184
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.220
Kid, I'll tell you something
since you don't seem to know.

185
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.230
Nishitsu-san's hearing
aid was malfunctioning.

186
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.980
So Nishitsu-san wouldn't have noticed

187
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.990
if the culprit staggered or the mat creaked.

188
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.570
How did you know that?

189
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:26.700
What?

190
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:32.200
How did you know Nishitsu-san's
hearing aid was malfunctioning?

191
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.080
Is it because he told you
before you struck him?

192
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.910
No, I...

193
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.840
Did you call me?

194
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.090
In that case, I must apologize.

195
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.590
It seems my hearing aid is acting up again.

196
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.620
We realized the hearing aid was malfunctioning
because the professor sent him a message, right?

197
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.600
Yes.

198
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:04.860
The message the professor sent Nishitsu-san
30 minutes before we arrived hadn't been opened.

199
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.320
If it was unopened because he didn't
hear his phone's notification,

200
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.180
then we can assume his hearing aid
had been malfunctioning since then.

201
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.330
Tojima-san.

202
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:24.650
Didn't you say you didn't realize the object
Nishitsu-san was wearing on his ear was a hearing aid?

203
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.800
Given that Nishitsu-san had been
conversing with you normally,

204
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.810
then as Conan-kun said, you must've learned
his hearing aid was malfunctioning when...

205
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.820
I... didn't mean to kill him.

206
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.280
My daughter has a serious illness that
costs a huge amount of money to treat.

207
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.330
My last hope was the black
lacquer tray I found in storage.

208
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:04.140
Since two other clients had brought in
similar trays, I couldn't help myself.

209
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.590
I came to ask about the
results before the other two.

210
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.500
Take a look.

211
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.220
Look at its dignified and
magnificent appearance.

212
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.580
This is the real black lacquer tray.

213
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.180
Unfortunately, it's not the one you brought.

214
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.440
No...

215
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.730
However...

216
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.110
That's my tray!

217
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.190
Five million...

218
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.500
If I had five million more yen, I
could afford my daughter's surgery.

219
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.680
Your own tray would've been
enough to cover that cost.

220
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.500
What?

221
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.480
The other two trays aren't
fakes, but studies.

222
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.430
Carved by famous engravers
when they were young,

223
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.880
they're impressive works
modeled after the real tray.

224
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.400
They can't compare to the real tray,

225
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.710
but they're probably worth
several million yen.

226
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.770
No...

227
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:07.650
Th-Then what I did was... no...

228
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.620
H-Hey, more importantly,
which box was the real tray in?

229
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.950
Naturally, it was in mine, right?

230
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.580
Actually...

231
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.300
What?!

232
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.090
You don't remember which box it was inside?

233
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.500
Really?

234
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.590
Yes. I know I put the real
tray in my box, but...

235
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.780
Then out of respect for your elders,
shouldn't you let me take it?

236
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.390
You must be joking.

237
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.330
Hey.

238
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.300
I know who had the real tray.

239
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.110
What?

240
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.010
You do?

241
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.860
Yeah, it's simple.

242
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.220
When Tojima-san struck Nishitsu-san—look.

243
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.050
The blood spray reached their boxes.

244
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.620
Because of that, there's some
blood on the boxes and trays, too.

245
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.530
You're right.

246
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.630
Think about it.

247
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:16.140
If the real tray was in front of
Nishitsu-san when he was struck,

248
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.390
then that tray's box would've
been empty at the time.

249
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:26.120
So the person whose cushion inside
their box has blood on it,

250
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.270
Chono-san, is probably the owner
of the real black lacquer tray.

251
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.780
All right!

252
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.840
What am I supposed to tell the owner?

253
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.120
It's all right.

254
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.540
If necessary, I'll lend
my tray to your museum.

255
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.680
I hope you'll offer us a discounted price.

256
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.080
But my dish still remains unappraised.

257
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.020
I guess I'll have another
appraiser look at it.

258
00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.320
That won't be necessary.

259
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.050
What?

260
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.160
The answer is written on the box.

261
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.050
You can read this?

262
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.060
Yes.

263
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:02.640
"The harder you hide, the
more obvious it becomes."

264
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.080
"The harder you hide, the
more obvious it becomes."
The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes.

265
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.680
The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes.

266
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.690
The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes.
It's a saying that means the harder
you try to conceal something,

267
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:12.070
The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes.
the more likely it is that
others will discover it.

268
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.820
The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes.

269
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.570
The harder you hide, the more obvious it becomes.
Kurisuke
And given that the name "Kurisuke"
is written at the end,

270
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.790
your uncle Kurisuke-san
probably repaired a dish

271
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.350
he accidentally broke using glue long ago.

272
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.580
Fearing it would be discovered,

273
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.910
he painted the entire dish with a similarly
colored oil paint to cover it up,

274
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.840
but suffered a severe scolding
for it when he was found out.

275
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.760
I believe he put the dish in a box
inscribed with that saying as a lesson.

276
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.870
Some of the paint had probably peeled off

277
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.140
because Nishitsu-san used
a solvent to remove it.

278
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.110
Really? That's all it was?

279
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.110
Anyway, "the harder you hide, the
more obvious it becomes," huh?

280
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.710
What a fitting saying. Right, you two?

281
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.680
Well, I had fun today.

282
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.920
See you later.

283
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.800
I wonder if she'll be back.
I wish she'd give me a break.

284
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.410
Unbelievable.

285
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.230
This isn't good.

286
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.180
I doubt she'll come that often.

287
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.170
I was able to keep her in check.

288
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:01.190
"Restore the flow of time?"
What do you mean by that?

289
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.950
"Restore" implies there's something
wrong with the current situation.

290
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.450
Or perhaps there's something wrong
with someone other than you.

291
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.950
It's none of your business!

292
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.630
She seems to have her own secrets
she doesn't want examined.

293
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.780
About that...

294
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.220
It's all right. I have some idea.

295
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.720
Although I won't be able to believe
until I see it with my own eyes.

296
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.300
No, he's wrong.

297
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:44.490
It's true that I was going to tell him that
Sera and Akai-san's mother Mary-san took APTX 4869

298
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.730
and is currently a middle school-aged girl.

299
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.640
But I actually wanted to confirm

300
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.200
Mary-san's true identity.

301
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.860
An English woman with that intelligence
and skill in hand-to-hand combat.

302
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.510
Furthermore, she called herself
"the sister out of territory."

303
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:12.490
Removing the abbreviation TER for "territory"

304
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:17.510
from the English word "sister" leaves you with SIS.

305
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.020
In other words, the Secret
Intelligence Service.

306
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:29.180
Also known as MI6, England's
secret information bureau.

307
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:38.020
Since she deliberately told me the name
"sister out of territory" hinting at that,

308
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.930
does that mean she's testing me to see if
I'm competent enough to trust as an ally?

309
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.260
50-50?

310
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.260
My favorite phrase?

311
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.010
Yeah, you sometimes use the expression 50-50.

312
00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.900
Right. Your father Tsutomu-san
said it all the time.

313
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.450
Come to think of it, our late
eldest son picked it up from him.

314
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.080
Shu-nii did?

315
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.010
More importantly, what about that drug?

316
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.610
What?

317
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.410
Will you be able to get your hands on any?

318
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.040
Not for now. I experienced
some odd interference.

319
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.810
Odd interference?

320
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.540
Yeah.

321
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.390
He's a graduate student who lives
next door to the professor.

322
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.930
Is he that interesting a person?

323
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.620
Y-Yeah, I guess so.

324
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.310
That was a 50-50.

325
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.430
You're also at fault.

326
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.040
Yeah, right.
