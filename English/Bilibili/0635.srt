1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,440
The sun is grand.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,140
Let's fill our bodies up with its energy.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,240
Don't tighten up

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,440
but let loose you mind and body.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,640
Right, Conan?

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,440
Yes.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,940
Why do I have to yoga diet anyway?

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Like the fog clears.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,340
Let's see through love and crime as well.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,240
I participated in a diet boarding class.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,040
A scary battle among women occurs.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,840
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:19,982
"Beware of Dieting"

16
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,782
"Yoga Diet Training Studio" -You're just great, Ran!

17
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,082
To win an invitation ticket to a yoga studio

18
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:29,482
that famous people come to!

19
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,982
Yeah, but you didn't have to bring me along too, did you?

20
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:36,582
Okay! I'm going to lose weight as much as I can

21
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,082
in one night two days!

22
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,982
Don't push yourself too much at once.

23
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:42,182
Because if you damage your body,

24
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:44,282
everything you do will be in vain.

25
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,282
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:51,682
This sure is a wonderful yoga studio.

27
00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:55,282
Uh, what does "Chandani" mean?

28
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:59,182
It means the light of the moon in Indian.

29
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,582
It's the same as your name, Tsukiko.

30
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,882
Yes. My parents who previously managed a yoga studio like this,

31
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:07,182
named me Tsukiko in hopes that

32
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,782
I would be able to take in energy from nature

33
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:12,282
and be mentally and physically healthy.

34
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:13,382
Thanks to that concept,

35
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:16,682
I've come this far with the help of all of you here.

36
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:19,082
I really appreciate it.

37
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:22,382
And the food we serve here also has a good reputation.

38
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,982
"Kaoru Iimori (29), Chef" -A plentiful but low calorie menu.

39
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:28,282
We grow all our organic vegetables here on our own!

40
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,182
And most important of all, the food is delicious!

41
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:32,782
Really?

42
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,482
"Atsuko Degawa (26)" -Just like the Chef,

43
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,982
the food was just showy and unsavory.

44
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,682
How dare...

45
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:41,782
Hot! What's with this?

46
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,582
I'll burn my tongue!

47
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:45,082
How dare you serve something like this?

48
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:47,582
Do you want to be fired again like you did at the previous restaurant?

49
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,382
Fired?

50
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,382
Herb tea, unlike Japanese tea,

51
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,182
is to be made using boiling water, you see.

52
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:56,182
Then, why didn't you warn me?

53
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,682
I'll write up on the internet

54
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:01,482
that I got ruthless treatment here.

55
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:02,782
If I do that,

56
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:05,582
the reputation here will take a great plunge, won't it?

57
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:08,682
That's...

58
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,982
Atsuko.

59
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:13,782
I don't think you should go that far.

60
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:17,382
You, an employee's daughter dare talk back to me?

61
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:21,982
That's right!

62
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:24,282
Get down on your hands and knees and apologize.

63
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:27,782
If you do, I don't mind forgiving you.

64
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:29,382
What the?

65
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:34,782
I'm so very sorry.

66
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,682
Tsukiko.

67
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,382
I'd just like you to understand that

68
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:44,882
this is not a complaint, but rather a reasonable opinion.

69
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:54,682
No matter what happens,

70
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:58,882
let's think of how we can make our guests stay here comfortably.

71
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,582
Is she the daughter of the president of Degawa concierge?

72
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:03,582
I've heard before that

73
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:06,482
she's a complainer that's really tough to handle!

74
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,482
Hello? How about it?

75
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:12,982
Did everything end well?

76
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,782
What? You lost the suit?

77
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:20,782
Just what do you think you're doing?

78
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:24,382
How can you not win a suit that is filed against me?

79
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:27,682
Huh? You want out of this case?

80
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:28,782
Fine!

81
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,882
Just don't think that you can work as a lawyer

82
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,782
like you've been up to now!

83
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:34,482
You'll pay for this!

84
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,382
Don't you ever bring that dog

85
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,682
anywhere near me from now on, understand?

86
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:58,282
Is Atsuko being sued for complaining against somebody?

87
00:05:58,282 --> 00:05:59,482
Yes.

88
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,982
Actually, there are a lot of other cases against her too.

89
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,682
I'm sure that she's having it tough inside.

90
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,682
Let's just let her be for now.

91
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:08,682
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:13,982
It looks delicious!

93
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,182
You can say that again!

94
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:18,382
So, this is the buffet that Chandani takes pride in.

95
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:19,782
Please help yourself to whatever you like.

96
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:20,882
-Okay! -Okay!

97
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:25,182
Please keep to each of your set calorie intake.

98
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:29,082
And, also, please take your meals to your rooms and eat there.

99
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,182
We don't want you comparing your meals with others

100
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,082
and be stressed out because you're discontented with what you dish has.

101
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,882
It's not good for your body and mind.

102
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:39,682
This wrap was ripped!

103
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,582
Bring a new one right away!

104
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,382
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:49,382
She just as nasty as ever.

106
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:52,382
She could be bluffing courage, you know.

107
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:54,582
Well, who cares.

108
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:58,882
Well, my intake is up to 600 calories, so...

109
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:01,582
Slightly pickled Queen of the Night.

110
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,082
This smells good!

111
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:07,082
I'm having this!

112
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:09,682
I'll try that, too!

113
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,182
Wait...

114
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:20,182
This dish has more inside, so I'm taking this!

115
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,682
The amount in all of the dishes is the same!

116
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,282
If so, there should be no problem

117
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,882
even if I change the dishes, is there?

118
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,882
Thank you for waiting.

119
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:36,082
With my calorie intake, I can only eat one dish!

120
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:39,782
But, after all, you came here to go on a diet.

121
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:40,882
Oh.

122
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,282
The moon is starting to show from between the clouds.

123
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:46,882
The moon has the powerful strength of purification!

124
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,382
It's good for beauty too,

125
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:50,682
so why don't we do yoga right now?

126
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,082
Not me!

127
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:54,182
I don't want to eat cold food!

128
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,182
Oh, come now!

129
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:57,482
Even if your food gets cold,

130
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,382
you can warm it up in your room.

131
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,782
And if you do what you have to do,

132
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:04,782
we'll serve you these strawberries as a reward.

133
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,382
I guess I don't mind participating then.

134
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:10,682
Okay, everyone.

135
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,282
After taking your meals to your room,

136
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,882
please gather in the yard immediately!

137
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,282
Are you going out?

138
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:23,982
Yes. I'm going to the fields

139
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:27,182
to pick some vegetables for tomorrow's breakfast.

140
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,882
So, let's bathe in the light of the moon

141
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:35,482
everyone and feel purified and refreshed!

142
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:40,382
Atsuko?

143
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:43,082
I could never do this pose!

144
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:44,382
I quit, I quit!

145
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:50,582
Atsuko?

146
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,782
What, quit bugging me, all of you?

147
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,882
I'm having my meal from now, so don't disturb me!

148
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,582
Right! I sweat a lot,

149
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:03,982
so wash it, okay?

150
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,482
Yasuko, are you all right?

151
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,382
I'm just fine. Don't worry about me.

152
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:20,982
Hey, everyone.

153
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,782
Is anything the matter?

154
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,282
No, it's really no big deal.

155
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:28,582
Okay, let's call Yasuko and go back to doing yoga.

156
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:35,282
What's that?

157
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,382
Yasuko?

158
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,682
-Thank you very much! -Thank you very much!

159
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:55,782
Neither Atsuko nor Yasuko came, did they?

160
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:58,882
Yasuko.

161
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,682
Is anything wrong?

162
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:04,782
I went over to Atsuko's room just now to check things out,

163
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:06,382
but the door's locked

164
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:08,282
and she didn't answer the door.

165
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:11,082
That's of concerned.

166
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:12,682
I'll go take a look,

167
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,282
so you all go have tea or something in the dining room.

168
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,682
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,382
Okay...

170
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,382
No!

171
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:51,982
What's the matter?

172
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:06,377
The victim is Atsuko Degawa, 26 years old.

173
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:10,977
The cause of death is potassium cyanide compound poisoning.

174
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,877
There seems to have been the same kind of poison

175
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,877
in the small dish on the table, too.

176
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:17,377
What is the estimated time of death?

177
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,577
Between the hours of 18:30-19:30.

178
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:22,877
That's during the 30 minutes

179
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:26,277
before Ms. Degawa returned from Yoga and was found.

180
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:29,177
Atsuko.

181
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:30,877
During the time her body was found,

182
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:34,377
the door and window were locked from the inside?

183
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,477
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,377
No doubt about it.

185
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:40,877
The room key was found in the pocket of the victim.

186
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:45,277
The spare key is in the safety box with a secret code lock to it.

187
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,677
Ms. Satoyama took it out

188
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,377
and brought it here to open the door of this room.

189
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,977
Suicide?

190
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,877
Atsuko was really shocked about losing the suit

191
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:58,177
that she was fighting over in court.

192
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,377
That's why...

193
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,377
What's this suit about?

194
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:05,377
She was a well-known filer of complaints.

195
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:06,777
Filer of complaints?

196
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:08,977
But she got sued over that,

197
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,777
and it seems several lawsuits had been filed against her.

198
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:15,577
She got a call from her lawyer in the afternoon

199
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,777
telling her that she lost the suit.

200
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:20,677
She stayed confined in her room all afternoon.

201
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:23,977
I'm sure she was depressed.

202
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:29,777
So, she committed suicide depressed over losing the suit.

203
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,777
Huh?

204
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:34,577
There's condensed milk on the strawberries.

205
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,777
True.

206
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:37,577
I guess she brought it in here without permission.

207
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:42,377
Isn't it strange that she forgot to eat her dessert?

208
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,877
Conan.

209
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,977
People who are contemplating suicide aren't composed,

210
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,877
so things like this happen.

211
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:52,077
Suits were filed against Atsuko from many people.

212
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:53,977
She was also hated,

213
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:57,177
so grieving over all that she...

214
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,677
Come to think of it,

215
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,177
weren't you fired from the restaurant

216
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:04,477
that you were working at because of Atsuko's complaint?

217
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:07,477
Is that true, Ms. Iimori?

218
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:09,577
It's true, but...

219
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:13,077
I didn't put any poison inside!

220
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,377
Besides, the food is all self-service.

221
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,377
How would I know what dishes that broad would pick out

222
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:21,277
of the several dishes that are lined out on the table?

223
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:22,977
True.

224
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:27,477
Moreover, she snatched Ran's small dish away from her too.

225
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,877
Then, what were you doing

226
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,677
while Ms. Degawa went to put her meal in her room?

227
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,877
I went to the fields about a 10 minute walk from here

228
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,977
to pick vegetables for tomorrow's lunch!

229
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:38,577
After that, I was in the kitchen

230
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,677
right through making preparations for tomorrow!

231
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:42,477
That's right.

232
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:46,777
I saw her working in the kitchen right through from the yard.

233
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:49,377
See? It's not me!

234
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,977
It could be that you pretended to go to the field,

235
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:56,177
but actually went back secretly to insert the poison.

236
00:13:56,177 --> 00:13:57,277
If I remember correctly,

237
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:59,177
you're also able to take the keys out of the safety box, no?

238
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:01,777
What?

239
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:04,177
Kaoru! Don't tell me that you...

240
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,677
Speak for yourself! Although you pretend to be her friend,

241
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,177
didn't you actually hate her?

242
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,777
-What? -We saw, you know!

243
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:15,777
That you were stepping on her wear in the laundry room!

244
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:18,577
Is that true?

245
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:20,277
-Yes. -Yes.

246
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:24,077
I was doing Yoga with all of you too, right?

247
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,277
After I quit part way,

248
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,677
I was in the laundry room right through.

249
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:30,377
But, after everybody went back to do yoga,

250
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:33,977
you could have secret returned to that broad's room, right?

251
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,577
You could've inserted the poison then.

252
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,577
I didn't do it!

253
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,477
By the way, how about you, Ms. Satoyama?

254
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:42,777
I was doing Yoga with everyone.

255
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,877
She was with us right through.

256
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,877
I'm sorry. I'll get him right away!

257
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:53,177
Hey, wait up, Cookie!

258
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:57,877
There, got you!

259
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:00,277
There, there... Good boy, stay still, will you?

260
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:03,977
-He must've been really scared. -Yep.

261
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,477
I'll go put this away.

262
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:10,277
Put away?

263
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,377
It's gone.

264
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:23,677
The thing that's supposed to be here.

265
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:27,377
There, there, you be good now.

266
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,977
I see! I've got it!

267
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,977
I've figured out the truth of this case!

268
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:37,677
Okay, then, please give us the details at the station.

269
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,277
Yes, sir.

270
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,477
Sonoko, don't tell me...

271
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:55,977
Yeah.

272
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:58,577
Things are going so sluggishly that it's making me sleepy.

273
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,577
What the...

274
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:03,477
I can afford to lose any more of my beauty sleep,

275
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,077
so I'll solve the case right here and now!

276
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,777
What?

277
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,477
First of all, Kaoru...

278
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,977
I don't think you're aware of it,

279
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:15,077
but that yellow stain on your shoulders...

280
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:18,577
That's pollen from the Night Queen, isn't it?

281
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,177
The Night Queen is a flower with a short life span

282
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:25,877
going from bud to full bloom in one night after which it dies.

283
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:29,077
The petals of this flower are also edible.

284
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:32,877
Slightly pickled Night Queen was on tonight's menu, wasn't it?

285
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,977
Therefore, you definitely went to the field

286
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:37,677
to look for the flower.

287
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,977
Conan says he definitely saw yellow powder

288
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,377
on your clothes after you came back

289
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,677
that wasn't there when you went out.

290
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:48,077
Yes, I remember!

291
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:51,077
And, Yasuko!

292
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,177
You're not the culprit either.

293
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:56,377
Let's assume that Yasuko did go to Atsuko's

294
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,977
and inserted poison,

295
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,577
it would've been impossible for her

296
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,077
to lock the room from the outside.

297
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,577
Because the key was in Atsuko's pocket

298
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,677
and the spare in the safety box.

299
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:10,177
In other words, it means that she committed suicide after all?

300
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:14,077
Why don't we let the deceased rest in peace already?

301
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,477
See, the moon is beautiful

302
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:18,377
as if to mourn over the dead.

303
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:20,377
No!

304
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:23,077
The moon is not there to mourn over the dead

305
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:26,477
but rather to shine light on the truth!

306
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:27,777
Tsukiko.

307
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:31,477
The truth is you were the one who murdered Atsuko!

308
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:36,477
Sonoko, just what are you...

309
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:38,177
Tsukiko.

310
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:40,477
You went out of your way

311
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,677
to lure Atsuko out to do Yoga under the moonlight,

312
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:47,677
because you needed to make her take her meal to her room first.

313
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:49,777
Even if I were able to make her take her meal to her room,

314
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,977
I wouldn't have had the time to insert poison in her food.

315
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:55,477
You didn't have to

316
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:58,577
because the poison would've naturally made it into her food

317
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,877
because of Atsuko's certain behavior.

318
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:03,277
Just what do you mean?

319
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,577
Ran, think back at the time

320
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,877
we were worried and went up to her room.

321
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:11,177
What did she do?

322
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,177
Well...

323
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,477
I heard the bell of the microwave oven.

324
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:19,577
So, she could've been warming up her food.

325
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:21,777
Right! I'm sure that she covered her small dish

326
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,577
with Saran Wrap back then.

327
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,677
But, what's strange is,

328
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:29,977
I don't see a trace of the wrap that was used anywhere.

329
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:32,577
Come to think of it, there isn't.

330
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,477
But, what on earth does that have to do with?

331
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:36,877
I'm sure you've all experienced it at one time or another.

332
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:39,077
But when you warm something up after covering it with wrap,

333
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,177
steam turns into vapor droplets that stick to the wrap

334
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,777
and fall into the food in the dish.

335
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:48,477
What if poison was smeared onto the wrap?

336
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,377
I see!

337
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,477
Tsukiko.

338
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:52,977
You smeared poison onto a wrap

339
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:55,677
with a certain amount of length beforehand,

340
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:59,477
dried it and wrapped it back onto the roll again.

341
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:00,577
Then all you had to do was create a situation

342
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:04,177
to get Atsuko to warm up her food using the microwave

343
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,177
no matter what dish she chose and poison her to death.

344
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,277
That's an interesting deduction,

345
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:13,477
but I gave her a new roll of wrap in front of everyone, didn't I?

346
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,477
So, how could I have put poison on it?

347
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:18,777
That's how you schemed it to begin with!

348
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,777
You wanted to show all of us in front of our eyes

349
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:24,977
that you changed the roll of wrap.

350
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,877
I cut the box open and gave it to her, you know.

351
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:30,077
I didn't rig it or anything!

352
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,377
As for the Saran Wrap box,

353
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:33,077
if you tear the box from the side,

354
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:34,077
you can easily take the roll of Saran Wrap out

355
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:35,877
without opening the box from the front.

356
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,377
I see.

357
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,477
See? Doing yoga in the moonlight

358
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:40,877
and exchanging the box of Saran Wrap

359
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:45,177
were all secretly schemed by you!

360
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:47,777
Do you have proof that I did it?

361
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:50,277
In the first place, the wrap with the poison on it

362
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,577
is nowhere in sight, is it?

363
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:55,777
Of course, because you hid it in a certain place.

364
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,077
Huh? Where on earth?

365
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,477
Tsukiko. Why did you bring Cookie

366
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:05,577
who you were told never to bring back to this room again over?

367
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,377
That's...

368
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:11,577
It's because you retrieved the used Saran Wrap with poison on it

369
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,977
and hid it in Cookie's pocket.

370
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:18,277
Officer Chiba, please check inside Cookie's pocket!

371
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:19,677
Okay.

372
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,577
I found it!

373
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:29,277
You deceived everyone saying that you were going to check on her,

374
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:31,077
went to her room.

375
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:33,877
Then when you did, you quickly put the little bottle in the room,

376
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:36,877
put the used Saran Wrap in a plastic bag

377
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:39,277
and hid it in Cookie's pocket.

378
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,777
But, for a dog with a keen sense of smell,

379
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:42,877
the smell of poison is intolerable

380
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:45,177
even if it is put in a plastic bag.

381
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,177
Cookie who got excited started running around

382
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:51,777
and you lost your chance to get rid of the wrap.

383
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:03,377
Yes. I'm the one who did it.

384
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:06,577
Tsukiko. Why?

385
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:10,677
The boarding house that my parents managed three years ago

386
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:13,477
went bankrupt because of that woman's complaint.

387
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,877
And because of that, my parents ended up with a tremendous amount of debt

388
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:18,477
and eventually committed suicide.

389
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,377
Oh, no.

390
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:23,177
Three years since the death of my parents,

391
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:28,177
I established Chandani with blood, sweat and tears.

392
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,977
A week ago,

393
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:34,277
that woman called to make reservations.

394
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:41,377
That woman didn't even remember me, and said...

395
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:42,977
I hear that the number of celebrities

396
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:44,977
going over to your place is increasing,

397
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:48,977
but if you can't satisfy me, I'll run you bankrupt.

398
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,677
I couldn't forgive her!

399
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:53,877
I wasn't going to let a woman like her

400
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,677
do what she wants to Chandani!

401
00:21:56,677 --> 00:22:00,277
That's why I shut her up.

402
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,277
That mouth of hers that knew only how to complain...

403
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:05,177
I shut it up forever!

404
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:30,277
"Several days later" -It's delicious!

405
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,477
Just as expected of you, Ran!

406
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,977
You win a sweets buffet this time!

407
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:38,177
To exercise well, then enjoy eating!

408
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:40,277
Both are important!

409
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:42,377
Exactly!

410
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:45,377
Don't blame me if you end up with a super rebound of weight.

411
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,477
"Next Episode" -I will gladly accept the offer to perform!

412
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:53,077
They're asking Dad to appear on

413
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:54,977
"The Most Useful School in the World" show as an instructor.

414
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:55,777
"The Most Useful School in the World" show as an instructor.
Principal Sakai!

415
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:57,377
Principal Sakai!

416
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:59,077
It's Vice Principal Ueda!

417
00:23:59,077 --> 00:24:01,477
Class representative Arita is also here!

418
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:04,877
About how much does that vase cost?

419
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,277
Around 160 million yen?

420
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,877
This is a super treasure

421
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,477
that even Thief Kid would go pale thinking about!

422
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:13,777
Next Conan,

423
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:17,977
"The Most Useful School in the World Case (Part 1)"

424
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:21,204
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:23,304
"Puffed grains candy machine"

426
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:25,404
The stage of the next episode is that popular program!

427
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:26,704
You mean TV? I'm going on air!

428
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:28,008
I don't think you should.
