1
00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:05.457
Pops and I accompany Ran and Sonoko shopping,

2
00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:08.257
and end up finding the dead body of a woman

3
00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:10.357
in the toilet compartment of a restroom in a park.

4
00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:13.257
We witnessed the victim, Ms. Mihiro Kuze

5
00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:15.857
dressed in Goth Lolita fashion,

6
00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:18.957
at a coffee shop in Shinjuku.

7
00:00:20.357 --> 00:00:22.857
Although Mihiro sits down once,

8
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.257
she gets up to go to the restroom outside the shop

9
00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.557
even before placing her order.

10
00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:31.257
Just then, Yuika, Mihiro's friend

11
00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:33.557
that she had been waiting for, shows up,

12
00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:37.157
but Mihiro never came back to her seat.

13
00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:40.357
Ms. Shodo is counted as one of the suspects,

14
00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:42.957
but she had a perfect alibi.

15
00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:44.757
However...

16
00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:52.057
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

17
00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:54.057
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

18
00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:56.057
Murder case because of warped friendship.

19
00:00:56.057 --> 00:00:58.457
Keep on the look-out for costume that Ran and Sonoko are wearing!

20
00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.257
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:02.257
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:04.257
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:54.321
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 2)"

24
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:57.621
This lady that came first...

25
00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:59.821
Did she order anything?

26
00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:01.421
No, nothing.

27
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.321
She was looking through the menu

28
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:06.421
before going to use the restroom though.

29
00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:10.121
Can I borrow this menu, then?

30
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:12.321
-Yes, sir. -I don't think you'll find...

31
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.721
-Mihiro's fingerprints on it. -Huh?

32
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:16.321
"Yuka Shodo (26)" -I accidentally spilled water

33
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.421
out of the glass cup on the table.

34
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.521
When I tried to pick that cup up,

35
00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:22.421
I carelessly placed the menu on top of the table

36
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.821
soaked with water and wet it,

37
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.021
so I wiped it later.

38
00:03:27.021 --> 00:03:30.421
Of course, I wiped the table and the sofa

39
00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.021
where the water splashed on to.

40
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.821
No trace of Mihiro having come here would be left behind.

41
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.221
Which means that I'm the killer?

42
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.121
Inspector?

43
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.821
No.

44
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.721
But it's a problem.

45
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.921
The cup that Mihiro was holding

46
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:50.021
dropped to the floor and cracked too.

47
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.521
Cracked?

48
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:58.121
If it cracked, isn't it still here, the cup?

49
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.821
Yes! Inside the incombustibles trash bag.

50
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.521
Is this the debris?

51
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:06.621
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.821
This is the only cup that cracked today.

53
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.921
Let's call forensics and have them check it.

54
00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:16.121
If you like, would you like to go to the shop

55
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.621
that Mihiro bought her clothes at too?

56
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:20.621
I have an idea of what shop Mihiro would go to.

57
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:27.221
Yes, it's her.

58
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:29.621
She came yesterday at sundown to buy it.

59
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.221
-Alone? -Yes, sir.

60
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.321
Then, is she the only one who bought that outfit?

61
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:38.721
No. This is an original of our shop

62
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:39.721
that we put on the shelves yesterday.

63
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:40.921
It's really popular,

64
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:43.721
so it sold out on the same day.

65
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.921
Did you see her among the customers who came to buy the outfit?

66
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.121
I wonder.

67
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.321
-I couldn't have bought it, could I? -Huh?

68
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:53.921
I was on a business trip in Fukuoka last night,

69
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.621
and while riding a cab,

70
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.821
I got a call from Mihiro saying that she bought the outfit!

71
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:01.821
In Fukuoka...

72
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:04.921
Yes! I arrived in Haneda Airport this afternoon,

73
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.721
and went straight to that coffee shop in Shinjuku!

74
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:09.221
Really?

75
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.321
You can go ahead and check on it if you want!

76
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.821
I was on that plane together with a colleague of mine!

77
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.621
If that's true,

78
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:19.521
she didn't have a chance to buy that outfit.

79
00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:21.921
But she's probably the culprit.

80
00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.321
How on earth did she do it?

81
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:26.021
Hey, Conan.

82
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.221
Come here.

83
00:05:28.221 --> 00:05:31.821
I borrowed the fitting room in this shop and changed.

84
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:33.021
Hey, hey.

85
00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:36.721
Wearing Lolita clothes when there was a murder?

86
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:38.621
How do you like it?

87
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:44.021
Is it funny, after all?

88
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:47.721
It... It's not funny, but...

89
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:50.521
Oh no! She looks cute!

90
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:56.021
God! It's no use showing this kid, it's a waste of time!

91
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.021
How come you're both wearing the same outfit?

92
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.321
You know nothing about things like this, do you?

93
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.721
This is a type of fashion and...

94
00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:11.021
I see.

95
00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:14.521
Mihiro's fingerprints were found on the cracked piece of glass cup.

96
00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.021
Which means, she's got a perfect alibi.

97
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.921
Then, will you please let me go already?

98
00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:23.121
It's getting pretty late, too.

99
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:28.621
It's already pretty late.

100
00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.621
I see. That's how it is.

101
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.821
Huh? A strangely clean place?

102
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.621
I don't think there was such a place

103
00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:43.321
inside the toilet where the body was found.

104
00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:45.321
Did you check the other toilet compartments too?

105
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.621
No, not yet.

106
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:51.921
The toilet right next to it.

107
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:53.921
Only the cover of the toilet paper holder in that compartment

108
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.521
was strangely really clean.

109
00:06:56.521 --> 00:06:58.021
There!

110
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:03.321
I'm leaving then!

111
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:07.321
I've got to inform my other friends about Mihiro's death too.

112
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:09.621
No, I can't let you go just yet.

113
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:11.821
Something keeps bothering me.

114
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:13.521
I can't understand why Mihiro who was expecting

115
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.421
to meet you at the coffee shop in Shinjuku,

116
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:18.121
left to go to the restroom

117
00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:20.821
and left the shop as well without waiting for you.

118
00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:23.621
Then, for some reason was found killed

119
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:26.221
in a restroom in a park in Harajuku.

120
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:29.821
How should I know?

121
00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:32.121
All I can say is,

122
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:34.621
about 10 minutes after Mihiro left to go to the restroom,

123
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.121
I went into that coffee shop

124
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:38.321
and kept calling Mihiro on her cell phone

125
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:41.121
because she didn't come back. I continued to call her,

126
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:42.721
but she didn't answer her cell phone,

127
00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:45.221
and then when I finally got through...

128
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:50.321
the person who answered was you, Inspector!

129
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:54.721
Or what? Do you still suspect that I'm the culprit?

130
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:57.521
No, it's not that.

131
00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:01.421
Inspector, Ms. Shodo is clear!

132
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:03.721
You mentioned a while ago, didn't you?

133
00:08:03.721 --> 00:08:06.021
That if Ms. Shodo were the killer,

134
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:08.421
after Mihiro left to go to the restroom,

135
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.521
she would've had to call her and tell her to come to the park.

136
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.921
Then, after killing her,

137
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:14.821
Ms. Shodo would have to return to that coffee shop.

138
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:17.821
It takes more than 30 minutes from that coffee shop

139
00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:20.721
in Shinjuku to the park in Harajuku round trip.

140
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:24.521
It's impossible for Ms. Shodo to come to the shop 10 minutes

141
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:26.421
after Mihiro left the shop.

142
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:30.521
Mihiro's fingerprints were detected on the glass cup, weren't they?

143
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:35.921
If so, that is clear fact that Mihiro came to the shop!

144
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:40.121
But I wonder why Mihiro touched that cup?

145
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:43.121
Huh? If they serve you water at a coffee shop,

146
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.021
you'd most naturally drink it, wouldn't you?

147
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:49.521
But that cup that this lady dropped

148
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.721
had no lipstick on it anywhere.

149
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:59.021
Remember? The lady dressed in Goth Lolita fashion

150
00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:02.421
was wearing pitch black lipstick, right?

151
00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:05.021
That's true.

152
00:09:05.021 --> 00:09:08.021
I don't think you know, sonny

153
00:09:08.021 --> 00:09:10.621
but it's manners for a lady to inconspicuously

154
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.921
wipe off from the cup any lipstick that is on the cup with her fingers.

155
00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.121
But I don't think there was any trace of lipstick

156
00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:19.521
being wiped off with her fingers either.

157
00:09:19.521 --> 00:09:25.021
Then, when Mihiro hit the cup as she opened the menu,

158
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.021
maybe she just moved it to the side?

159
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.921
It could be that she didn't drink out of the cup at all,

160
00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:32.121
but rather got up right away to the restroom.

161
00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:35.121
Even when I returned the menu,

162
00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:39.421
I hit the cup, dropped and cracked it.

163
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:43.721
But you were lucky that the cup cracked.

164
00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:46.521
Lucky?

165
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:49.521
Because if it didn't crack,

166
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:51.821
you would've been asked by the Inspector

167
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:53.921
to come to the scene of the crime.

168
00:09:53.921 --> 00:09:56.321
And if after you left the coffee shop,

169
00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:58.921
the employee cleared the cup away, and washed it,

170
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:02.721
don't you think the fingerprints would've come off?

171
00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:06.421
And, why did you sit on the same side

172
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:10.121
where the Goth Lolita woman was sitting?

173
00:10:10.121 --> 00:10:12.321
Usually, when you wait for somebody and meet them,

174
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:15.321
you sit in the seat opposite them, don't you?

175
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:17.721
That's...

176
00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:19.521
If you didn't sit on that side,

177
00:10:19.521 --> 00:10:21.721
you wouldn't have cracked the cup either.

178
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.221
You idiot! Who cares where you sit!

179
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:28.121
Besides, the cracked cup may not have been washed,

180
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:30.021
but it's for sure it would've been thrown away!

181
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:32.021
And if it's collected by the dump truck

182
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:33.921
and taken to Yumenoshima or something, that's it.

183
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:35.821
Just how many officers do you think is needed...

184
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:38.821
-to look for it from within the heap of trash! -Troublesome.

185
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:47.121
Hey, Mouri!

186
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:48.521
Don't tell me it's come again.

187
00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:51.821
Mouri... The Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:53.821
Indeed.

189
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:57.621
I won't let this case go to sleep, though.

190
00:10:57.621 --> 00:11:01.521
I'll explain it so it makes sense.

191
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:03.121
After strangling Ms. Mihiro Kuze to death

192
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.321
in the restroom in the park at Harajuku,

193
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:08.421
you went right away to the coffee shop in Shinjuku

194
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:11.821
to establish an alibi for yourself.

195
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:15.221
Isn't that right, Ms. Yuika Shodo?

196
00:11:28.468 --> 00:11:30.968
Hey, hey, wait a minute there, Mr. Mouri.

197
00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:33.168
You also said that

198
00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:35.668
it'll take at least 30 minutes round trip

199
00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:37.668
to get from the park restroom to the coffee shop,

200
00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:40.568
so how could Ms. Shodo who came to the shop

201
00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:42.868
10 minutes after Mihiro went out to use the restroom, have done it?

202
00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:46.268
It's true that if Mihiro was killed after she stood up

203
00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:49.668
to go to the restroom, it'd be impossible.

204
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:54.268
But if Mihiro was killed before she came to the shop then...

205
00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:56.168
it's possible!

206
00:11:56.168 --> 00:11:58.968
Before she came to the coffee shop...

207
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.468
Which means that the one who came to the shop...

208
00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:05.368
Yes. I think that maybe you felt the same too

209
00:12:05.368 --> 00:12:07.668
when you saw Mihiro's body.

210
00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:10.768
I'm sure you though Goth Lolita fashion is flashy and very strong.

211
00:12:10.768 --> 00:12:12.468
The employee at the coffee shop

212
00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:14.968
along with us, who were there as customers of the shop,

213
00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:18.168
were taken aback by the strong impact of her appearance.

214
00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:20.468
So, we don't really remember what she actually looked like

215
00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:23.268
and can't acknowledge her!

216
00:12:23.268 --> 00:12:26.668
No one would ever imagine that the office lady type woman

217
00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:30.068
that came into the shop 10 minutes later

218
00:12:30.068 --> 00:12:31.868
was in fact the same person

219
00:12:31.868 --> 00:12:34.068
as the one who came in wearing the Goth Lolita outfit!

220
00:12:34.068 --> 00:12:37.968
Huh? What on earth are you talking about?

221
00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:39.668
You said that Mihiro's fingerprints

222
00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:42.268
were found on the glass cup of the coffee shop!

223
00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:44.168
It's no surprise!

224
00:12:44.168 --> 00:12:46.768
Because that cup

225
00:12:46.768 --> 00:12:50.068
is one that you stole from the coffee shop beforehand!

226
00:12:51.668 --> 00:12:52.968
Right.

227
00:12:52.968 --> 00:12:57.468
You probably invited Mihiro over to your house,

228
00:12:57.468 --> 00:13:00.868
poured a drink into that cup and served it to her.

229
00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:04.168
You did so to get her fingerprints on the cup!

230
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:07.768
You hid the cup that was placed before you

231
00:13:07.768 --> 00:13:09.868
when you first came into the shop wearing the Goth Lolita

232
00:13:09.868 --> 00:13:12.068
into your bag,

233
00:13:12.068 --> 00:13:16.668
and switched it with the cup with Mihiro's fingerprints on it.

234
00:13:16.668 --> 00:13:19.968
10 minutes after that, you changed your make-up and clothes

235
00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:21.268
and came to the shop.

236
00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:23.068
You deliberately sat in the same seat you sat in

237
00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.368
when you first came to the shop

238
00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:29.468
so that you could deliberately drop the cup that you had switched.

239
00:13:29.468 --> 00:13:31.368
You wanted to splash the water onto the floor

240
00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:32.668
and crack the cup.

241
00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:38.768
By wiping the place where you were seated 10 minutes ago,

242
00:13:38.768 --> 00:13:41.268
you wanted to create a situation,

243
00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:42.768
in which things wouldn't look strange

244
00:13:42.768 --> 00:13:44.768
even if traces of Mihiro couldn't be found where she was sitting.

245
00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:46.168
In order to use the cup

246
00:13:46.168 --> 00:13:49.268
as the only evidence showing that Mihiro came.

247
00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:50.668
You wanted to crack it

248
00:13:50.668 --> 00:13:53.068
because then the cracked pieces would have to be picked up,

249
00:13:53.068 --> 00:13:54.368
and your fingerprints would also be detected

250
00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:55.468
on the glass cup you switched,

251
00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:57.768
so you could deceive everyone.

252
00:13:57.768 --> 00:13:59.368
But you said a while ago that

253
00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:01.468
if it cracked, it would be thrown away.

254
00:14:01.468 --> 00:14:07.268
That is, if Mihiro's body was found 2-3 days later!

255
00:14:07.268 --> 00:14:08.768
I see!

256
00:14:08.768 --> 00:14:12.368
That's why you kept on calling Mihiro repeatedly!

257
00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:13.668
If the phone keeps ringing

258
00:14:13.668 --> 00:14:15.968
and no one answers or comes out of the toilet,

259
00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:18.868
somebody is bound to check inside sooner or later!

260
00:14:18.868 --> 00:14:23.568
The more so, if it's just the time the toilet gets crowded!

261
00:14:23.568 --> 00:14:25.268
If Mihiro is found,

262
00:14:25.268 --> 00:14:30.068
the police would suspect you, who kept calling her,

263
00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:33.168
and go over to the coffee shop where you promised to meet her,

264
00:14:33.168 --> 00:14:37.368
and you would be able to show the cracked glass cup to the police

265
00:14:37.368 --> 00:14:39.968
before it's disposed of as incombustible trash!

266
00:14:39.968 --> 00:14:41.668
Hold it!

267
00:14:41.668 --> 00:14:45.868
Have you all forgotten that Mihiro came last night

268
00:14:45.868 --> 00:14:49.268
to buy the Goth Lolita clothes she was wearing, alone?

269
00:14:49.268 --> 00:14:52.768
Moreover, it was sold yesterday and only for one day!

270
00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:54.168
Since I came back from my business trip

271
00:14:54.168 --> 00:14:56.968
in Fukuoka this afternoon,

272
00:14:56.968 --> 00:14:58.468
I couldn't have bought it!

273
00:14:58.468 --> 00:15:01.568
The point is not who bought it.

274
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.368
But, rather, how many outfits were bought.

275
00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:10.568
Excuse me. Did Mihiro buy just one outfit like that?

276
00:15:10.568 --> 00:15:12.668
No, she bought two.

277
00:15:12.668 --> 00:15:15.168
She said that she could only come at sundown

278
00:15:15.168 --> 00:15:19.568
so to reserve and keep two outfits for her.

279
00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:21.668
It was a popular outfit

280
00:15:21.668 --> 00:15:23.868
that we put an advance advertisement out for,

281
00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:25.968
so she wanted us to keep it for her before it sold out.

282
00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:29.168
After the police came to confirm with the salesclerk

283
00:15:29.168 --> 00:15:32.068
whether Mihiro came alone to buy the outfit,

284
00:15:32.068 --> 00:15:33.868
you...

285
00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:36.868
Then, was she the only one who bought that outfit?

286
00:15:37.768 --> 00:15:40.668
You interrupted the conversation, didn't you?

287
00:15:40.668 --> 00:15:42.568
You did so to stop the salesclerk

288
00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:48.868
from mentioning that Mihiro bought two outfits, didn't you?

289
00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:51.268
You wanted people to place attention on who bought the outfit,

290
00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:55.468
rather than how many outfits were bought.

291
00:15:55.468 --> 00:15:56.968
Am I wrong?

292
00:15:58.568 --> 00:16:00.568
But, Mr. Mouri...

293
00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:04.068
I understand that Yuika and Mihiro were the same size

294
00:16:04.068 --> 00:16:06.268
and that Yuika made Mihiro bring her

295
00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:10.268
the outfit she bought yesterday, over to her today.

296
00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:13.268
But if Yuika had to completely copy the clothes,

297
00:16:13.268 --> 00:16:15.968
make-up and hairstyle of Mihiro after killing her,

298
00:16:15.968 --> 00:16:17.968
wouldn't it take up a lot of time,

299
00:16:17.968 --> 00:16:21.468
that she would practically have no time to establish an alibi?

300
00:16:21.468 --> 00:16:24.968
It can't be that they both promised each other

301
00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:27.268
to wear the same outfit before the killing either, could it?

302
00:16:27.268 --> 00:16:29.468
-Oh, as to that... -Exactly!

303
00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:31.968
Besides, maybe she bought the two outfits

304
00:16:31.968 --> 00:16:34.668
for herself and not for me.

305
00:16:34.668 --> 00:16:36.268
Because she really liked it, and was keeping one more

306
00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:38.468
so she could wear the other one if one of them get dirty!

307
00:16:38.468 --> 00:16:40.768
Right? There are people like that, aren't there?

308
00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:43.268
Well, yes.

309
00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.368
As to that mystery,

310
00:16:45.368 --> 00:16:49.668
my daughter and her friend will resolve it.

311
00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:51.968
Ran and Sonoko!

312
00:16:51.968 --> 00:16:53.868
What're you hiding for?

313
00:16:53.868 --> 00:16:54.968
Hey.

314
00:16:54.968 --> 00:16:56.768
That idiot!

315
00:16:56.768 --> 00:16:58.568
Pops says to come out quickly

316
00:16:58.568 --> 00:17:01.268
and show us your cute outfit!

317
00:17:01.268 --> 00:17:04.168
-What? -Oh, goodness.

318
00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:07.768
Ta-da!

319
00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:12.668
What's with that look?

320
00:17:12.668 --> 00:17:14.568
Moreover, it's the same clothes!

321
00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:17.368
That's called the twin fashion.

322
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:19.268
Twin fashion?

323
00:17:19.268 --> 00:17:22.468
It's a fashion referring to good friends wearing matching clothes,

324
00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:23.968
the same hairstyles, make-up

325
00:17:23.968 --> 00:17:25.968
and even carrying the same kind of bag,

326
00:17:25.968 --> 00:17:29.168
so they virtually look like twins!

327
00:17:29.168 --> 00:17:31.168
I thought that the person called Mihiro

328
00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:35.368
was going to enjoy twin fashion with a friend of hers.

329
00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:36.768
I see.

330
00:17:36.768 --> 00:17:40.168
You told Mihiro that you'd like to wear twin fashion,

331
00:17:40.168 --> 00:17:43.768
and right after changing clothes in that park restroom,

332
00:17:43.768 --> 00:17:47.668
you strangled her to death!

333
00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.968
Well, I wonder about that?

334
00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.768
If you want to substantiate that, show me, will you?

335
00:17:52.768 --> 00:17:56.868
-Proof that I did it. -There is proof...

336
00:17:56.868 --> 00:18:00.068
on your left arm.

337
00:18:00.068 --> 00:18:03.568
When you looked at your wristwatch a while ago...

338
00:18:04.268 --> 00:18:06.368
It's getting late...

339
00:18:07.368 --> 00:18:08.868
You stopped part way

340
00:18:08.868 --> 00:18:12.468
and looked at your cell phone watch, didn't you?

341
00:18:12.468 --> 00:18:16.468
You probably hesitated because when you strangled Mihiro,

342
00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:20.268
she scratched your left arm and the mark was there.

343
00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:24.368
You've got a scratch.

344
00:18:24.368 --> 00:18:26.768
No! I did this myself when I was half sleeping!

345
00:18:26.768 --> 00:18:28.968
Yes, you have all the reasons in the world

346
00:18:28.968 --> 00:18:31.168
to justify that scratch of yours.

347
00:18:31.168 --> 00:18:36.168
Besides no skin traces were found on Mihiro's fingertips,

348
00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:40.168
so she must've scratched you with her fake nails.

349
00:18:40.168 --> 00:18:42.768
It would be impossible to prove that you did it

350
00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:44.468
as long as the fake nails are disposed of.

351
00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:47.868
That's why despite the fact that

352
00:18:47.868 --> 00:18:52.468
you had to get away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible.

353
00:18:52.468 --> 00:18:55.168
All the fake nails on both her hands

354
00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:58.368
were completely removed using a nail remover.

355
00:18:59.568 --> 00:19:01.768
Why...

356
00:19:01.768 --> 00:19:05.468
You wanted to hide the fact that you were scratched,

357
00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:09.968
along with the fact that the blood that dripped from the scratch

358
00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:14.668
fell onto a certain place in the toilet!

359
00:19:14.668 --> 00:19:17.068
And just where is that certain place?

360
00:19:17.068 --> 00:19:20.068
Officer Takagi should be calling soon about that.

361
00:19:23.668 --> 00:19:25.368
Yes, Megure here.

362
00:19:27.468 --> 00:19:29.868
What? Blood reaction was found

363
00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.868
in the compartment next to the murder site?

364
00:19:31.868 --> 00:19:36.068
Only the toilet paper cover here had no dust on it,

365
00:19:36.068 --> 00:19:38.568
so I had forensics check it,

366
00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:40.168
and luminol reaction was detected!

367
00:19:40.168 --> 00:19:43.268
And? What about the result of the blood test?

368
00:19:43.268 --> 00:19:46.368
It wasn't the victim's blood,

369
00:19:46.368 --> 00:19:48.668
so it's probably the culprit's.

370
00:19:48.668 --> 00:19:51.268
Most probably this is the compartment

371
00:19:51.268 --> 00:19:52.668
where the actual murder took place,

372
00:19:52.668 --> 00:19:55.368
but since her blood dripped,

373
00:19:55.368 --> 00:19:59.268
I think she moved the body to the next compartment.

374
00:19:59.268 --> 00:20:01.468
That seems to be the story!

375
00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:05.368
I would like to take your blood and have it checked.

376
00:20:06.268 --> 00:20:09.168
Take it if you want.

377
00:20:09.168 --> 00:20:13.468
As for me, Mihiro took all and everything from me

378
00:20:13.468 --> 00:20:15.768
and I don't even have blood left for my nose to bleed.

379
00:20:15.768 --> 00:20:17.268
Take everything?

380
00:20:17.268 --> 00:20:18.668
You mean like your boyfriend?

381
00:20:18.668 --> 00:20:21.468
Yes, he's one of them, too.

382
00:20:21.468 --> 00:20:24.868
The first time it happened was when I was 20, I think?

383
00:20:24.868 --> 00:20:26.368
I was down and out,

384
00:20:26.368 --> 00:20:29.168
but to make things worse, I was fired from my company

385
00:20:29.168 --> 00:20:31.068
and evicted from my apartment.

386
00:20:31.068 --> 00:20:34.768
In the end, for some reason, my friends all pulled away from me.

387
00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:36.568
Eventually, the only one left was

388
00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:39.568
my childhood friend, Mihiro.

389
00:20:39.568 --> 00:20:44.368
She got me a job at her parent's company.

390
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:45.568
And I also started to live in her condo

391
00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:48.268
after she introduced me there.

392
00:20:48.268 --> 00:20:50.168
Rather than take things from you,

393
00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:53.368
she seems to have looked after you!

394
00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:57.868
Yes. I used to think so until just recently, too.

395
00:20:57.868 --> 00:20:59.468
Until I found out that I got fired,

396
00:20:59.468 --> 00:21:03.468
was evicted from my place and lost my friends...

397
00:21:03.468 --> 00:21:07.768
All because of the things that Mihiro did behind my back!

398
00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:08.768
What?

399
00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.268
Why would she do something like that?

400
00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.368
I wonder.

401
00:21:11.368 --> 00:21:15.268
I think she just wanted to make sure our bond wouldn't break?

402
00:21:15.268 --> 00:21:19.768
Because I was the only best friend she had.

403
00:21:21.268 --> 00:21:24.668
But I was betrayed.

404
00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:27.068
And I believed her.

405
00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:31.668
That's why I took from her this time.

406
00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:05.068
You two who are living in a fairy tale world

407
00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:07.368
better be careful, too.

408
00:23:07.368 --> 00:23:11.268
There's nothing more uncertain and fragile as friendship.

409
00:23:11.268 --> 00:23:13.568
Well, let's hear the rest of story out at the station.

410
00:23:13.568 --> 00:23:16.568
Are you nuts?

411
00:23:16.568 --> 00:23:19.068
That's why it's good, because it's uncertain and fragile!

412
00:23:19.068 --> 00:23:21.268
That's why when your heart and heart connects,

413
00:23:21.268 --> 00:23:23.068
you feel warm inside!

414
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.968
If it were super hard like a steel plate

415
00:23:24.968 --> 00:23:27.168
working out the way you want it to,

416
00:23:27.168 --> 00:23:29.868
you could never feel the warmth!

417
00:23:32.468 --> 00:23:34.368
Right.

418
00:23:34.368 --> 00:23:38.768
If I could just have talked to her like you do,

419
00:23:38.768 --> 00:23:41.968
maybe we could've have had

420
00:23:41.968 --> 00:23:44.668
a warm relationship like old times too.

421
00:23:52.268 --> 00:23:54.468
Awesome, Sonoko!

422
00:23:54.468 --> 00:23:56.268
Yeah!

423
00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:57.468
I mean... but saying something like that,

424
00:23:57.468 --> 00:23:59.068
dressed the way you are, I don't know.

425
00:24:02.968 --> 00:24:05.868
Where is everybody?

426
00:24:11.968 --> 00:24:13.868
It smells like almond.

427
00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:14.968
What?

428
00:24:14.968 --> 00:24:17.368
Don't tell me that there was poison in this bottle?

429
00:24:17.368 --> 00:24:19.668
We're the Youth Detective Squad!

430
00:24:19.668 --> 00:24:21.768
We've come to help out with the investigation!

431
00:24:21.768 --> 00:24:24.268
A girl called Mayu, who looks like me

432
00:24:24.268 --> 00:24:26.468
was caught in a landslide?

433
00:24:26.468 --> 00:24:29.068
How'd you get that flashlight?

434
00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:31.668
If I remember correctly, back then...

435
00:24:31.668 --> 00:24:36.225
