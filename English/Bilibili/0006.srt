1
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:04,773
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:07,953
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a pill that shrunk him!

3
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:09,213
Doesn't matter if I'm small!

4
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:10,863
My mind is that of a
former great detective,

5
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:12,383
and my powers of deduction are flawless

6
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:13,833
when it comes to cases that
seem absolutely unsolvable!

7
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,833
Valentine's Day is a case of love.

8
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:18,303
Who knows, there may be poison
in that sweet chocolate!

9
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,474
The Valentine Murder Case.

10
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:03,114
So, what are you going to do, Ran?

11
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:04,394
About what?

12
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,074
Your chocolate for Valentine's Day!

13
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,774
This huge event only comes
once a year, you know!

14
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:14,534
We have to use chocolate
to capture men's hearts!

15
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:17,004
Oh, right...

16
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:20,544
You're, like, spacing out or something...

17
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:23,404
Am I?

18
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,234
Oh! What about him?!

19
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,114
Who's "him"?

20
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,114
Oh, come on!

21
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,984
Those two guys who tried to pick us up
at the coffee shop that one Sunday!

22
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:33,904
Remember?

23
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,024
They said they were both medical
students at Beika University!

24
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,734
Especially Minagawa-san!
He's totally cool!

25
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,564
The other one was
Wakamatsu-san, was it?

26
00:02:44,194 --> 00:02:46,444
He's perfect for you, Ran!

27
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:49,234
He seemed really interested
in you, after all!

28
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,944
Hello there, Ran-san!
I've been looking for you!

29
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,824
What good timing!

30
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,384
Don't you agree?

31
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:05,584
We'll solve any case at all,
no matter how difficult it may be!

32
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,954
If you have any problems,
just leave it to us!

33
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:15,634
Conan! Stop loafing around and help!

34
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:20,164
I'm high school detective Shinichi Kudo!

35
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,104
I'm not about to play games
with a bunch of pipsqueaks!

36
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,374
Ran!

37
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:32,084
Ran-san! I'm here today
to ask you something important!

38
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,414
Ran-san!

39
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:36,984
I'm here to ask you on a date!

40
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,784
Date?!

41
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:43,194
Would you come with me
to tomorrow's Valentine party?

42
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,094
Valentine party?

43
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,834
Yes. Girls are supposed to give
chocolate to a boy they like,

44
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,704
and if the boy feels
the same way for her,

45
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,774
he will eat the chocolate
right there on the spot.

46
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,734
Say, will Minagawa-san be coming too?

47
00:03:57,444 --> 00:04:00,204
Of course. The party is taking place
at his house, after all.

48
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,714
We'll come! Ran and
I will both come for sure!

49
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:05,644
Sonoko!

50
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,554
R-Really?!

51
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:11,384
This is great! Thank you very much!

52
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:15,724
Valentine party? Gimme a break.

53
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,764
Well then, I will come
pick you up tomorrow.

54
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,034
Bye!

55
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:25,534
Why did you say that without asking me?!

56
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,234
I guess I was right after all.

57
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,974
You like Shinichi-kun, don't you?

58
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:32,174
You're being faithful to him

59
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,674
and giving all other guys
the old "no thank you" routine!

60
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,644
Don't be stupid! Who would actually
like that big mystery geek?!

61
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,114
Well excuse me.

62
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,384
Then you'll go to
the Valentine party, right?

63
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,754
Of course I'll go!

64
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:47,094
Alright! It's decided!

65
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:51,064
Just you watch, Katsuhiko Minagawa!

66
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:56,534
I'll use my chocolate to melt
even your bone marrow!

67
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:59,504
Sonoko has a new obsession...

68
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,974
Mori Detective Agency

69
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:06,704
I'm the great detective Kogoro Mori...

70
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:11,914
What are you doing, Ran?

71
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,184
Nothing much...

72
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,454
It smells like chocolate!

73
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,624
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day!

74
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,594
You have someone to give
chocolate to then?

75
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,594
How rude!

76
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,424
I wouldn't be making chocolate by hand
if I didn't have someone to give any to!

77
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:31,634
Oh, right! Who knows,
Shinichi might just come back!

78
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,504
Shinichi?

79
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,734
Now that I think about it,
there was a guy by that name...

80
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,744
Hey, now.

81
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,144
I'm going now!

82
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:49,984
OK. Go and catch a rich man.

83
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:53,724
That's weird.
Conan-kun isn't here either.

84
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:56,094
Ran! What're you doing?!

85
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:57,424
We're about to leave without you!

86
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,134
I have no choice but to find out
where that chocolate winds up!

87
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,404
Sorry to keep you waiting!

88
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,874
And away we go!

89
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:15,014
Cheers!

90
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:24,224
Now then, let us introduce our
Beika University tennis club

91
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:27,654
to our guests, Ran Mori-san
and Sonoko Suzuki-san!

92
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,794
You go first, Minagawa!

93
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:33,294
OK. I'm Katsuhiko Minagawa,
the captain.

94
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:35,134
I'm happy to meet you two.

95
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,594
Really?!

96
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:38,134
I'm happy too!

97
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:40,404
Calm down, calm down...

98
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,274
I'm Kaori Sekiya.

99
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:45,344
Sonoko-san. You're still young, but you
shouldn't go overboard like that...

100
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,914
She's envious of me.

101
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:52,584
She's really pretty but obviously
really jealous too...

102
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:56,084
Naomichi. You're next.

103
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,494
Come on. You really are
gloomy, you know that?

104
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,924
I'm Yoshimi Watanabe.
Nice to meet you.

105
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:07,394
And then there's me,

106
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:14,474
the strong, yet sensitive,
Toshihide Wakamatsu!

107
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:19,774
Who does Ran think she is?

108
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,844
She actually looks
like she's having fun.

109
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,414
I'm sorry for the wait!

110
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,784
Here is today's main dish!

111
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:32,654
Thank you ever so much, Mrs. Minagawa!

112
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,754
You're Minagawa-san's mother?!

113
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,754
You're so young!

114
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,094
You certainly know
how to flatter a woman!

115
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:43,194
Hey, lady! Let's play together!

116
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:46,504
Susumu! Go to your room!
You're disruptin' the party!

117
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,974
You're Minagawa-san's younger brother?

118
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:50,544
You're so cute!

119
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:54,074
But he doesn't really look
like Minagawa-san, does he?

120
00:07:56,414 --> 00:08:00,754
How long is that stupid
Ran going to be here?!

121
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,484
I'm so cold and hungry!

122
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:07,754
Oh no!

123
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:10,694
Conan-kun! What are you doing here?!

124
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:18,234
I was just going to a friend's
house but then I got lost!

125
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,904
Do you know that boy?

126
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:25,874
Yes. He's been staying at my house
lately for certain reasons.

127
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:28,444
It must be cold outside. Come in.

128
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:30,914
OK!

129
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:36,084
I think someone should perform something.

130
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:37,724
Naomichi! You do it!

131
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:43,764
You not hear me or something?!
Get this party started!

132
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,124
I'm not very good at that sort of thing.

133
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:49,534
What?! You dare defy me?!

134
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,774
Just looking at your face makes me sick!

135
00:08:56,574 --> 00:08:59,674
Don't you think Minagawa-san's
got a bit of an attitude problem?

136
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:02,074
It's good for guys
to be a little like that!

137
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,014
Anyway, did you bring your chocolate?!

138
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,414
Yeah...

139
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:09,454
Watch! Minagawa-san's down for
the count once he eats my chocolate!

140
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,724
You sure you didn't put
poison in it then?

141
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,994
I, Sonoko Suzuki, humbly offer--

142
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,094
Say, beautiful girls like you

143
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,234
must have hobbies like tea ceremony
and flower arrangement, right?

144
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,804
Karate.

145
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,934
How could Ran-san do
anything so uncivilized?!

146
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,134
Karate.

147
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:32,574
As if such a lovely and charming
woman would ever be into karate!

148
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:39,714
Kaori.

149
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:43,554
Stop treating Naomichi like that.

150
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:48,694
It really pisses me off when you
feel sorrier for him than me!

151
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:51,664
You mean to say you're
worse off than him?

152
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:52,464
What?!

153
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,594
You've changed!

154
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,534
You've become so reckless
ever since then!

155
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:58,064
What do you know?!

156
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,634
I know enough! We grew up
together, after all!

157
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,204
Get a hold of yourself!

158
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:07,374
Will you accept this?

159
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:12,244
Knock it off.
I only want to be friends.

160
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,554
I see...

161
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:16,354
I guess you really do
like Yoshimi the best...

162
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:23,094
What's the matter?

163
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:34,404
It should be OK, right?
It's just her hand...

164
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:35,474
Here goes!

165
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,244
I have to take the initiative!

166
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:48,054
What lovely hands...

167
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,254
Ran-san!

168
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:55,794
Outta the way!

169
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:56,924
Conan-kun!

170
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,494
R-Ran-san!

171
00:10:58,494 --> 00:10:59,594
Yes?

172
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,894
Take that!

173
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,034
Freakin' kid!

174
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,734
Stay away from Ran!

175
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:08,474
Conan-kun!

176
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:11,574
Susumu! How many times
do I have to tell you?!

177
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:15,544
No sweets! Your cavity
still hasn't healed yet!

178
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:19,584
But Kaori gave it to me!

179
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:28,724
Kaori.

180
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,264
It was Katsuhiko, wasn't it?!

181
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:34,934
Did he do something bad to you?

182
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,494
It's none of your business!

183
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,704
Katsuhiko's nothing but human scum!

184
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:42,034
There's no reason for him to hurt
you like that, no matter what!

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,474
Just leave me alone!

186
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,844
Damn that Katsuhiko!

187
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:53,144
Go Minagawa-san!

188
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,054
Katsuhiko! It's 10 years too soon
for you to challenge me!

189
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:03,694
Well, everyone has to be good
at something, I guess.

190
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:08,394
Ran-san must be sick of being
with a guy with muscle for brains.

191
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,804
Minagawa! Are you lookin' for a fight?!

192
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,734
I just call it like I see it.

193
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:14,904
What?!

194
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,744
You're always like this!

195
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:20,514
Why not think about other
people's feelings for once?!

196
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:23,114
You mean you have feelings too?

197
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,244
Why, you...

198
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,944
Now, now, that's enough!

199
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,414
How about something
to work off that alcohol?

200
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:30,724
Let go!

201
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:33,754
Say, Katsuhiko...

202
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,824
What?! You gonna lecture me too?!

203
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,294
I would never.

204
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:43,094
Now then, let's all have dessert!

205
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,864
Ah, here it is!
Mrs. Minagawa's home-made cakes!

206
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,374
I hope you like them...

207
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,404
Of course I will! Thank you!

208
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:00,914
Say, is that cake good?

209
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,154
Both the cake and the coffee are great!

210
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:10,294
Bitter!

211
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,794
Don't drink her coffee!

212
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,664
Here! Have some cake!

213
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,134
Katsuhiko. Aren't you going
to eat your cake?

214
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,674
No. I hate sweets.

215
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,744
Don't you think maybe
you're smoking too much?

216
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:29,974
You should try to cut back a little.

217
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,684
Get off my case and quit annoyin' me!

218
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:37,424
Looks like I got a little drunk.

219
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:38,754
Think I'll go get some fresh air.

220
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:41,554
Empty.

221
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:48,894
You can have mine.

222
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,874
Yoshimi likes him after all...

223
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,244
What does she see in him, I wonder?

224
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,814
Which reminds me, do you have
any chocolate for me, Ran-san?

225
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,554
It's Katsuhiko! He's...

226
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:20,734
K-Katsuhiko! Katsuhiko!

227
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,334
Katsuhiko!

228
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,364
Call for the police and an ambulance!

229
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:25,964
Right!

230
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,674
Katsuhiko!

231
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:32,404
Mrs. Minagawa...

232
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:55,593
Katsuhiko-san passed away earlier.

233
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,933
The cause appears to be agricultural
chemicals used as food poison.

234
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:00,133
Yoshimi Watanabe-san.

235
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,803
He collapsed shortly after eating
your chocolate, did he not?

236
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:04,403
Yes.

237
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:12,543
It goes without saying that
this case is an easy one.

238
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,813
What are you doing here?!

239
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,623
Having received word from my daughter,

240
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:21,023
I, the great detective Kogoro Mori,
hastened to the scene!

241
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:24,763
You did it!

242
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:28,793
You poisoned the chocolate
in order to kill the victim!

243
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,703
Romantic issues were your motive!

244
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:33,563
All we have to do is check the rest
of your chocolate to prove it!

245
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,373
No! It wasn't me!

246
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,543
Yoshimi!

247
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:45,113
Everything's too convenient
for it to have been her.

248
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:50,753
Everyone's eaten the exact
same things as the victim.

249
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:52,083
Even if the sushi was poisoned,

250
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,193
it would be impossible to tell
which ones the victim would eat.

251
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:58,163
Everyone drank coffee that
came from the same pot.

252
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:00,533
Which means it was the cake?

253
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,433
No, the victim didn't eat it!

254
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,933
No. I hate sweets.

255
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,673
What does it all mean?

256
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:12,243
Was Yoshimi-san the murderer after all?!

257
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,313
That's it!

258
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,413
Mister!

259
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,053
Come to think of it,

260
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,353
there was a cigarette butt at
the crime scene, wasn't there?

261
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,123
A cigarette?

262
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,093
That's right! That's a possibility too!

263
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:34,293
So this is the cigarette butt
discovered at the scene of the crime.

264
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,103
Yes, there are ways
to poison cigarettes...

265
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:40,733
I saw it! When Minagawa-san
went outside,

266
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,433
Naomichi-san gave him his cigarettes!

267
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,583
N-Naomichi! How could you?!

268
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:52,243
Well?!

269
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:54,513
We can always find out if we examine
the cigarette butt, you know!

270
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,483
It's true! I did it!

271
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,453
I've hated him for a long time!

272
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:05,093
That damn Katsuhiko was
always making a fool of me!

273
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,963
He even hurt Kaori!

274
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:13,403
So I put poison
in the cigarette filter!

275
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:14,503
The filter?

276
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:21,113
No! He didn't do it!

277
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:24,743
Mommy! My tooth hurts!

278
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,713
She's washing the coffee cups.

279
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:32,083
At a time like this?

280
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,923
That's it! I got it!

281
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:34,323
Here goes!

282
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,993
I call this the Anesthetic Watch Gun.

283
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:43,233
With it, you can make anyone within
close range go to sleep instantly.

284
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:56,913
His voice was Number 59,
if I remember correctly...

285
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,943
One moment, please, Inspector Megure.

286
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,613
He is not the murderer.

287
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:07,823
What are you talking about?
He's confessed to it, you know.

288
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:12,793
He did indeed plan to murder
the victim, but he failed.

289
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,033
Have a look at the cigarette butt.

290
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:22,003
All of the victim's other cigarettes
in the house were unfiltered.

291
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:24,643
After receiving the
cigarettes from Naomichi,

292
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:27,773
the victim removed the filter
before lighting one up.

293
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,983
In other words, he didn't smoke
the part that had the poison in it.

294
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:34,453
Then who did it, Dad?!

295
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,083
The real murderer was...

296
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,953
...you, Katsuhiko-kun's mother!

297
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,093
What are you talking about?!

298
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:50,463
How in the world could I have done it?!

299
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,333
By poisoning the food.

300
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,533
Everyone ate the same food!

301
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,903
Yes. But only Katsuhiko-kun died.

302
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,913
He died because he didn't eat.

303
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:03,243
What do you mean, he didn't eat?

304
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,483
Mrs. Minagawa.

305
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:06,983
I hear you were nearly red with anger

306
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:09,913
when Susumu-kun ate some chocolate.

307
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,823
Yet you let him have some cake!

308
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:15,653
Why was that?

309
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,463
It was because you put
poison in the coffee

310
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:20,333
and the antidote in the cake!

311
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,533
Seeing Susumu-kun drink
the poisoned coffee,

312
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:28,033
you rushed to give him some
of the cake and the antidote!

313
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,703
You knew that Katsuhiko-kun
probably wouldn't eat the cake

314
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,443
since he hated sweets.

315
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:37,483
Then, upon devising this plan,

316
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:41,953
you decided to use the fact that
Yoshimi-san loved him to your advantage!

317
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:46,953
You knew without question that
he would eat her chocolate.

318
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,653
Being the very first
person on the scene,

319
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:53,023
you took the chocolate
he partially ate

320
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:56,363
and replaced it with
poisoned chocolate!

321
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,103
All while trying to make
Yoshimi-san look guilty, of course.

322
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,233
Pure fiction! There's no proof!

323
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:06,543
But there is. In the coffee cups.

324
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:10,683
Before the police came, you washed
the coffee cups as quickly as possible.

325
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:12,983
No matter how much you washed them,

326
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:15,283
detailed examination
will still find the poison!

327
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,083
Even if there isn't
any left in the cups,

328
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,423
there will still be some
in the drain pipes.

329
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:21,653
Mrs. Minagawa.

330
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,023
It appears it's starting to melt.

331
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:29,593
Yoshimi-san's real chocolate bar,
which you hid in your kimono, that is.

332
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,003
Nonsense!

333
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:36,103
How would I know that he would
eat Yoshimi's chocolate?!

334
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,573
Why would I kill my own son?!

335
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:44,613
No! Katsuhiko's real parents
died 7 years ago in an accident!

336
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:48,583
Then you, his father's sister,
took him in!

337
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:54,323
Katsuhiko liked Yoshimi because
she looked like his real mother.

338
00:20:55,293 --> 00:21:00,533
That's how you knew for sure
that he would eat her chocolate!

339
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,833
I'm so sorry, Yoshimi-san!

340
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,403
I just happened to see you
buying chocolate one day

341
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,173
and then the idea suddenly came to me!

342
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,873
I had no other choice!

343
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,943
We desperately needed
Katsuhiko's inheritance

344
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:17,843
because my husband's
business went under!

345
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:23,983
I wanted to protect this house
and Susumu's happiness!

346
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:08,523
A lot sure happened today...

347
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,123
What should I do with
this chocolate now?

348
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,963
Ran-san! Here you are!

349
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:15,893
I could give you a ride
home if you want...

350
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:17,903
No, that's okay...

351
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:21,003
Oh! Is that chocolate for me?!

352
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:22,033
No--

353
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,473
Thank you! I'm utterly delighted!

354
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:25,343
That's enough!

355
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:32,713
Just leave me alone!

356
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:35,413
I'm sorry for bothering you!

357
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:40,793
For Shinichi-kun

358
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,453
Ran...

359
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,093
You can eat it if you'd like.

360
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:49,033
I'm sure Shinichi wouldn't mind either.

361
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:52,103
You followed me to keep me safe, right?

362
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:52,933
Thanks!

363
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:22,393
Sending 25 million yen along with toys
seems too much to be a prank.

364
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:27,373
And that letter... What does
it say they're coming for?!

365
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:34,443
Great work, Shinichi!

366
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,313
It was nothing--

367
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,783
On the next Conan--

368
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:43,913
The Threatening Monthly Presents.

369
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,839
Next Conan's Hint:

370
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:08,843
Next Conan's Hint:
Barcode.

371
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:11,030
Barcode.
