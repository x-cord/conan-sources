1
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.861
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

2
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.821
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

3
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.651
Deciphering codes together with Heiji.

4
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.581
Tokyo-Osaka large scale mystery solving.

5
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.223
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.021
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:47.531
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:34.011
"Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 1)"

9
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:41.901
Bummers, this rain sucks.

10
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.861
Just when we were thinking of playing soccer in the park.

11
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.351
But it started raining the minute we got there.

12
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:52.231
But there was 50% chance of rain,

13
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.741
so we did right to bring umbrellas.

14
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.751
Why don't we play games at Doc's house then?

15
00:02:58.091 --> 00:02:59.801
Yeah! Let's!

16
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.711
Speaking of games, how far did you get in "Titan Hunter"?

17
00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:05.461
I got to rank 7.

18
00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.761
I got the Haoken!

19
00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.121
No joke?

20
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.141
-Really? -Yep!

21
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:18.571
-And? What did you want to talk to me about? -Oh, right.

22
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:20.891
Do you understand...

23
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:24.151
what "Younger sister from another domain" means?

24
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.451
What?

25
00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:30.281
Is that a setting for a late night anime or something?

26
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:31.611
No.

27
00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:35.597
Masumi seems to be hiding an intermediate school aged girl,

28
00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:39.194
who looks just like her at her hotel.

29
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:44.461
It bothered me so much that I texted her about the girl yesterday.

30
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:48.961
She texted back, "She's my younger sister from another domain."

31
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:51.641
Then, she's her younger sister, no?

32
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:55.261
But she said she had no younger sister.

33
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:57.691
And what does "from another domain mean?

34
00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:04.231
Besides, I feel like I've met her somewhere before.

35
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.581
I guess you'll have to start from remembering where it was.

36
00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:13.701
I was thinking the same thing. But all I remember is her snaggletooth...

37
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.741
Ouch...

38
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:21.961
You brat! Watch it!

39
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:24.631
What's this?

40
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:26.471
Tea leaves?

41
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:27.591
Don't touch it!

42
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.881
There he is!

43
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:34.261
Hold it!

44
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.071
Who are those men?

45
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.731
-Probably cops. -What?

46
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:47.311
Judging from his appearance,

47
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:49.771
the one they were chasing is probably a drug dealer.

48
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:54.041
The tea leaves like stuff that you picked up is dried weed.

49
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:56.321
Probably marijuana.

50
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.781
What?

51
00:04:57.901 --> 00:04:59.931
Marijuana?

52
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:03.981
Oh, no! I touched that bag, you know?

53
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.211
Maybe your fingerprints got on it.

54
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:09.571
Your fingerprints on the bag is no big deal!

55
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:12.091
-You sure? -Yeah.

56
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.141
If you explain what happened to the police...

57
00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:17.711
A pocketbook?

58
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.021
That man must've dropped it.

59
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:24.221
Yeah.

60
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:31.961
But nothing seems to be written inside.

61
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.821
No. There's something small written on the edge of the page.

62
00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:39.061
There's an "E" and "2" and a "circled 2".

63
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:40.981
The character "ma" for drugs.

64
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:42.831
Drugs?

65
00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:46.351
Something else seems to be written after the "ma",

66
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.137
but unlike the letters and numbers on the side,

67
00:05:49.257 --> 00:05:51.113
it's written in water-based ink,

68
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.091
so it's smeared by rainwater.

69
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:58.041
There's something written on the next page, too!

70
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.451
Yeah. On the next

71
00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:04.101
and the next page, too.

72
00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:07.051
A total of 12 lines.

73
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.243
All that can be barely read of the blurred words are...

74
00:06:10.363 --> 00:06:12.311
"ma" on the 1st line,

75
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:14.561
"tsuki" on the 3rd line, "nihon" on the 5th line,

76
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:16.111
and "kyobashi" on the 9th line.

77
00:06:16.771 --> 00:06:18.351
I wonder what they are?

78
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.351
Codes, right?

79
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:26.001
Maybe they're code numbers for members of a drug smuggling organization!

80
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.001
Like E22 and S10.

81
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:32.491
What about the circles?

82
00:06:32.611 --> 00:06:35.381
And "tsuki" and "nihon" written after that?

83
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:38.021
And? Did you figure it out?

84
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:39.661
I don't have the slightest idea.

85
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:43.201
No use hanging on to it, so let's take it to the police box.

86
00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:46.161
-You're right. -Yeah.

87
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.391
Yeah.

88
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.401
See you officer!

89
00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:52.771
We're counting on you!

90
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:54.901
-Thank you! -Not at all.

91
00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.731
What now?

92
00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.091
It stopped raining.

93
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.291
Shall we go back to the park to play soccer?

94
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.181
Sorry.

95
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:08.001
I just remembered I had something to do so I'm going home!

96
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:09.801
Okay!

97
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:11.061
Bye!

98
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.671
See you later!

99
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:20.251
Conan's a crummy liar.

100
00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:22.351
It's so obvious!

101
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:25.561
We've learned over time.

102
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.351
So...

103
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:29.591
Ai, let us use the you know what!

104
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:31.061
Please!

105
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:32.311
Yes, yes.

106
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:41.241
Well, I got here.

107
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:43.871
But there's nobody here.

108
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:47.921
Just as I thought, it's no good unless I know what time.

109
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:55.731
The only ones here are the kids...

110
00:07:57.171 --> 00:07:59.511
who secretly came after me.

111
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.691
Oh, what a coincidence.

112
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.601
Do you have business this way, too?

113
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:06.861
Coincidence my foot!

114
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.742
You followed the location of my detective badge

115
00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.266
using those spare tracking glasses!

116
00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:13.601
Because...

117
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:15.561
No fair!

118
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:18.431
You're investigating something, right?

119
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:22.281
Yeah. The stuff that's written in this pocketbook

120
00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:26.411
is probably the place, dates and time of various drug deals.

121
00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:30.431
Drug deals?

122
00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:41.539
Drug deals?

123
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.539
How do you know?

124
00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:47.749
The clues are the notes written in water-based ink

125
00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:50.259
next to the letters and figures.

126
00:08:50.809 --> 00:08:53.153
The finger of the drug dealer was soiled

127
00:08:53.273 --> 00:08:56.579
with the same color ink as the smeared letters.

128
00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:59.769
So the letters were written by the drug dealer.

129
00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:03.071
If so, the codes written by permanent marker

130
00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:04.919
were written by someone else.

131
00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:08.019
It's only natural to think that the other party wrote it, right?

132
00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:14.399
The other party probably sent the drug dealer a pocketbook

133
00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.519
of codes designating the places, dates and time of the deals.

134
00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:21.119
He taught only the drug dealer how to decipher the codes,

135
00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:24.289
so no one else could figure it out even if they saw the pocketbook.

136
00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:28.249
What about the letters in water-based written by that man?

137
00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:33.069
Yeah. He wrote the answers to the codes next to it!

138
00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:36.179
He was probably planning to burn or trash them later.

139
00:09:36.439 --> 00:09:38.729
In other words, E22 to "ma",

140
00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:44.249
Y21 to "tsuki", G11 to "nihon". Each symbolizes a Chinese character.

141
00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:48.669
With these clues, you can tell right off

142
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.089
that they are subway routes and station numbers!

143
00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:52.289
What?

144
00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:59.019
So, E22 refers to the 22nd station on the Oedo Line, Azabu Juban.

145
00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:04.329
Y21 refers to the 21st station on the Yurakucho Line, Tsukishima.

146
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:09.029
G11 refers to the 11th station on the Ginza Line, Nihonbashi.

147
00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.029
Station numbers?

148
00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:12.789
What's that?

149
00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:14.514
Well, let me tell you.

150
00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:18.059
They're the circled letters and numbers

151
00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:22.059
displayed next to the name of the station.

152
00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:23.919
Really?

153
00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.459
Which means, you only remove the circled number

154
00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:29.939
or letter of the station and read it?

155
00:10:30.369 --> 00:10:34.307
Since in E22 of Azabu Juban, the 3rd number is circled,

156
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:37.709
so the 3rd kanji character "ju" is chosen.

157
00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:44.629
Using this rule, if you read up to the 5th line of the code, E22 is "ju"!

158
00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:48.086
C10 is Nijubashimae on the Chiyoda Line,

159
00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:50.363
the 1st letter is circled so it's "Ni"!

160
00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:54.582
Y21 is Tsukishima on the Yurakucho Line, so it's "tsuki"!

161
00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:58.905
M09 is Shinjuku Sanchome on the Marunouchi Line, so it's "san"!

162
00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.677
G11 is Nihonbashi on the Ginza Line, so it's "Nichi"!

163
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:06.070
If you line everything up, it comes out "December 3rd"!

164
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:10.859
Hey! Isn't today December 3rd?

165
00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:14.979
Yeah. So the deal's supposed to be today.

166
00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:19.489
I can't solve the lines below the date from the 6th line!

167
00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:23.409
The dates, location and time should be written, but...

168
00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:27.069
Since in N11 of Korakuen on the Namboku Line, shown on the 6th line,

169
00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:29.379
the 2nd number is circled, so the 2nd kanji character "raku" is chosen.

170
00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:33.769
In Y12 is Edogawabashi on the Yurakucho Line. Shown on the 7th line,

171
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:36.419
since the 2nd number is also circled here, "do" is chosen.

172
00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:39.199
It reads, "Rakudo".

173
00:11:40.609 --> 00:11:42.819
It's totally Greek to me.

174
00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.789
If so, why did we come here?

175
00:11:46.909 --> 00:11:51.134
Since HO2 on the 8th line, is Ebisu on the Hibiya Line,

176
00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:54.759
and there's a circle around it entirely, it's chose as is.

177
00:11:55.199 --> 00:11:58.729
Since on the side of N22, there is a written note "Kyobashi",

178
00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:02.183
and the 2nd number is circled, "bashi" is chosen.

179
00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:06.329
In other words, "Ebisubashi".

180
00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:11.689
That's why I took a guess that this would be the place.

181
00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:14.129
But I could be wrong.

182
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:18.541
I can't figure out why N22 is Kyobashi to begin with?

183
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:22.949
"N" stands for the Namboku Line, but there's no 22nd station.

184
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:26.709
Kyobashi is on the Ginza Line and right next to Nihonbashi

185
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.349
so it should be G10.

186
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:33.439
Besides, what is that arrow on the circle around Ebisu?

187
00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:35.609
Does it mean the next station?

188
00:12:35.969 --> 00:12:39.349
Naka-meguro and Hiroo are the stations on either side of Ebisu.

189
00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:45.319
If so, why isn't it written H01 and H03? Gosh!

190
00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:47.509
Even the last three lines,

191
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:51.409
I02 is Shiroganedai on the Mita Line, so "Shiro" is chosen.

192
00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:56.029
T22 is Baraki-Nakayama on the Tozai Line, so "Bara" is chosen.

193
00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:58.909
But I can't make out C22.

194
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:02.559
The Chiyoda Line ends at the 20th station, Kitahayase.

195
00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.819
Hey, show it to me, will you?

196
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:07.849
That code, hurry, show it to me!

197
00:13:08.128 --> 00:13:10.598
-Hattori? -Yeah!

198
00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:13.299
The kids called to tell me that you were on the verge of tears

199
00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:15.899
because you can't decipher the code.

200
00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:19.899
So, I, a much wiser great detective than you

201
00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:23.049
shall help you out if you want, you know?

202
00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.169
I'm gonna hang up.

203
00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:25.599
Sorry, really!

204
00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:28.769
Please let me help you, all right?

205
00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:31.749
I'll forward it to you now, so hang on.

206
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.969
Why did you have to call him?

207
00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:40.659
Because he's your detective master, isn't he?

208
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:46.509
-Huh? -He told us to call him anytime you needed help.

209
00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:49.199
He's not my master.

210
00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:51.819
Well, it's true that I needed help, though.

211
00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:55.069
I see.

212
00:13:56.359 --> 00:14:00.749
Codes using subway lines and station numbers.

213
00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:03.019
Interesting!

214
00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:06.029
Hey, just whose cell are you talking on?

215
00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:09.409
Oh, Inspector Otaki's!

216
00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:14.369
We just closed a murder case at Shinsaibashi.

217
00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:18.479
You're talking on my cell phone too, Conan.

218
00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:20.879
And? Anything?

219
00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:25.209
Is this G11 really Nipponbashi?

220
00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:27.899
Yeah, it's the station next to Kyobashi.

221
00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:30.889
The alphabet and numbers are all correct, you know?

222
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:35.409
Well, since both Nihonbashi and Kyobashi are subway stations in Tokyo,

223
00:14:35.869 --> 00:14:38.139
it's no surprise that you don't know them.

224
00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.019
What're you talking about?

225
00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:43.599
Nipponbash and Kyobashi are both names of stations in Osaka!

226
00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:45.939
Besides, there are many stations between them

227
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.299
and they aren't next to each other?

228
00:14:47.479 --> 00:14:48.519
What?

229
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:51.849
Moreover, it's pronounced "Kyobashi",

230
00:14:51.969 --> 00:14:54.909
with the accent on the first syllable.

231
00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:58.879
Hey. You've got a station called Kyobashi over there, too?

232
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:03.419
The code says so too, N22!

233
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:07.099
The "N" stands for Nagahori Tsurumi Ryokuchi Line.

234
00:15:07.219 --> 00:15:10.179
The 22nd station on that line is Kyobashi!

235
00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:14.309
Which means... Don't tell me that this code...

236
00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:16.729
"Ebisubashi" -What?

237
00:15:17.319 --> 00:15:19.909
You acquired a clue to deciphering the codes?

238
00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:21.049
Yeah.

239
00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:26.199
If there are stations in Osaka with station names, Nihonbashi and Kyobashi,

240
00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:29.807
the code using line and station numbers

241
00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:32.732
aren't limited to one specific district.

242
00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:36.269
And, if so, the codes that I deciphered

243
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:39.769
from the 1st to the 5th lines to be December 3rd,

244
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:42.019
may be wrong, too.

245
00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:43.249
Could be.

246
00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:48.299
There are stations with numbers in their names like

247
00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:52.839
Higashi-Mikuni, Yotsubashi, and Tanimachi Rokuchome.

248
00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:56.139
It seems that Osaka and Tokyo are the only cities

249
00:15:56.229 --> 00:15:59.239
with the station names Nihonbashi and Kyobashi.

250
00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:03.459
Some of these codes are written to the left

251
00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:06.899
-and others are written to the right, aren't they? -Huh?

252
00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:09.779
True, it looks to be so.

253
00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:12.347
Then! Maybe one side are the stations in Tokyo

254
00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:14.799
and the other in Osaka?

255
00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:16.249
If so,

256
00:16:16.369 --> 00:16:18.209
the codes that you deciphered,

257
00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:21.789
until the 5th line

258
00:16:22.119 --> 00:16:29.459
are all written on the left side, so they're all no good.

259
00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:34.679
-But Nihonbashi in Tokyo is G11, right? -Yeah.

260
00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:38.589
The Nipponbashi in Osaka isn't G11, is it?

261
00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:39.959
No, it isn't.

262
00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:44.439
The Nipponbashi in Osaka is K17 on the Sakaisuji Line,

263
00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:47.939
and S17 on the Sennichimae Line.

264
00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:52.419
If there is a note "Nihon" written beside G11,

265
00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:55.389
it's the Nihonbashi in Tokyo.

266
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:57.829
Hei-chan, I went and got it.

267
00:16:58.249 --> 00:17:00.209
A book that has information of the subway lines

268
00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:02.209
and station numbers in Tokyo.

269
00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:04.409
Oh, I don't need that anymore.

270
00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:06.929
I searched online and found it.

271
00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:08.299
What?

272
00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:10.119
Oh, come on!

273
00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:15.179
I went all the down way to the kiosk in Shinsaibashi Station to buy it.

274
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:18.109
The escalators were under maintenance, so I had to use the stairs

275
00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:20.379
and I'm pooped.

276
00:17:20.499 --> 00:17:23.309
What? Escalators?

277
00:17:23.739 --> 00:17:26.189
-That's right! Escalators! -What?

278
00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.479
When riding escalators,

279
00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:31.819
in Osaka people move to the right and open the left side,

280
00:17:31.939 --> 00:17:33.929
while in Tokyo it's the other way around, right?

281
00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:38.069
That's why the stations written on the right are stations in Osaka

282
00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:41.699
and the ones on the left are stations in Tokyo!

283
00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:43.499
I see.

284
00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:45.599
That's why the page was divided

285
00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:47.899
and the codes were written on the edge of the pages.

286
00:17:48.019 --> 00:17:51.709
If you take an overall look, it looks like stairs.

287
00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:55.319
So, let's say that "December 3rd" is correct.

288
00:17:55.439 --> 00:18:00.469
What stations in Osaka are N11 and Y12?

289
00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:05.609
N11 is Taisho Station on the Nagahori Tsurumi Ryokuchi Line,

290
00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:08.599
and Y12 is Higobashi, on the Yotsubashi Line.

291
00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:12.869
Both have circles around the 2nd number, so "sho" and "go" are chosen.

292
00:18:12.989 --> 00:18:17.489
In other words, "shogo", meaning 12:00 noon!

293
00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:19.479
Twelve noon!

294
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.379
Only 10 more minutes to go.

295
00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:23.749
No joke?

296
00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:27.399
If the drug deal's going to be here at Ebisu Bridge,

297
00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:30.919
-we better hide quickly, or they'll be here! -Yeah.

298
00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:35.189
H02 is written to the left, so it's "Ebisu"!

299
00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:38.263
If N22 is Kyobashi in Osaka,

300
00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:40.921
I think that the deal will be at Ebisu Bridge.

301
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:47.939
I don't know why there's an arrow attached to the circle encircling H02.

302
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:52.909
Hey, Hattori. Is there a bridge called Ebisu there, too?

303
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:54.674
Huh?

304
00:18:55.629 --> 00:18:56.748
Hattori?

305
00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:00.409
There is, here in Osaka.

306
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:03.569
The kanji characters are different,

307
00:19:03.689 --> 00:19:08.738
but there's a bridge that people often use to meet each other!

308
00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:12.639
Is that right? This arrow indicates...

309
00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:16.169
-that it's the Ebisu Bridge in Osaka. -Yeah!

310
00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:20.619
I'm running over right now. I'll get there in two to three minutes!

311
00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.199
-Wow! -He's good!

312
00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:26.639
He's unmistakably Conan's master!

313
00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:30.399
I feel sort of vexed.

314
00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:33.979
By the way, what is "shiroihara"?

315
00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:35.849
I want the answers to the three remaining lines

316
00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:37.649
under the location of the deals.

317
00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:42.989
I02, C22 and T22...

318
00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:45.088
C22 that is written to the right is

319
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:48.488
Takaida on the Chuo Line of Osaka, so it's "i".

320
00:19:48.608 --> 00:19:52.338
I02 and T22 that are written to the left,

321
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:55.738
are Shiroganedai and Haraki-Nakayama in Tokyo.

322
00:19:55.869 --> 00:19:57.204
So, you take "Shiroi" and "hara".

323
00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.143
If you join them together, it reads "Shiroihara (White belly)".

324
00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:02.309
I hope it doesn't mean that they'll be waiting

325
00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:04.109
sticking their white bellies out.

326
00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:07.499
No, it should be read "Baraki-Nakayama",

327
00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:09.389
not "Haraki-Nakayama"!

328
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:12.689
In other words, if you join them together, it reads "shiroibara".

329
00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:17.139
It probably means a "white rose" will be the sign!

330
00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:22.619
Hattori? What's up? Hattori?

331
00:20:22.739 --> 00:20:26.949
-You can't hear him? -Maybe something happened?

332
00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:31.264
Don't tell me he got caught trying to get the dealers.

333
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:35.239
He's so hot-blooded. It's possible.

334
00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:39.169
Hey, Hattori? Answer me, Hattori!

335
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:41.949
-Hattori! -There're three.

336
00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:46.599
I'm looking around Ebisu Bridge,

337
00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:51.159
and I see three people with a rose on, holding it,

338
00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:52.599
or waiting for somebody.

339
00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:57.439
Gosh.

340
00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:01.609
-At least tell me that you're at the bridge. -Sorry.

341
00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:03.869
I got carried away watching them

342
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:06.369
because they look so authentically suspicious.

343
00:21:07.069 --> 00:21:12.119
But, is it true that they're going do the drug deal here?

344
00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:13.749
Yeah, most likely.

345
00:21:14.569 --> 00:21:17.499
The owner of this pocketbook of codes

346
00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:21.499
had at least 4 large bags of marijuana.

347
00:21:21.619 --> 00:21:25.659
Even if one bag were to be about 500 grams, 4 bags would total 2 kilograms.

348
00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:28.319
The street value would be exorbitant.

349
00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:31.019
They weren't packed in small packages

350
00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:35.229
so he was probably gonna sell the entire batch at once.

351
00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:39.759
The deal may have already gone through, but...

352
00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:43.559
If the time arranged was noon,

353
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:47.069
they'd be meeting each other from now.

354
00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:51.259
And? How did the drug dealer look?

355
00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:54.279
He was unshaved, wearing a knitted cap and a parka.

356
00:21:54.399 --> 00:21:56.209
The typical drug dealer type.

357
00:21:56.889 --> 00:21:59.499
He was being chased by men who looked to be cops,

358
00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:01.959
so they may already have arrested him, though.

359
00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:05.839
He could've fled and headed over that way, so be careful!

360
00:22:06.239 --> 00:22:09.489
-I will. -By the way, where's Inspector Otaki?

361
00:22:09.609 --> 00:22:13.679
He went back to the headquarters to get backup.

362
00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.229
After all, I'm using his cell phone now.

363
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:20.449
-There's only 5 minutes to go before noon! -Yeah.

364
00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:23.967
I guess we'll have to narrow down the target

365
00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:25.279
to one by then.

366
00:22:26.649 --> 00:22:28.409
Just the two of us!

367
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:52.866
"Next Episode" -Isn't he the one? The bad guy?

368
00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:54.359
I think so, too!

369
00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:55.579
Me, too!

370
00:23:56.329 --> 00:23:58.369
It's one minute past the time of the deal.

371
00:23:58.899 --> 00:24:00.049
That guy...

372
00:24:01.409 --> 00:24:04.209
Hey, what's with you? What do you think you're doing?

373
00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:06.169
Kazuha!

374
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:10.259
I'll throw you all over down Dotonbori!

375
00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:11.549
Bring it on!

376
00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:13.822
Hey, Hattori!

377
00:24:14.854 --> 00:24:19.794
Next Conan, "Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 2)"

378
00:24:35.639 --> 00:24:37.789
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:39.747
"White rose"

380
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:42.630
-Huh? New Year's monetary allowance? -Please give us!

381
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.880
Big brother, give me some, too!
