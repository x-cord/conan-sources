1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,140
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,540
You must be true to yourself.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,040
A sound echoes from a vacant building.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,540
The rhythmic pattern is the signal of a crime.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,699 --> 00:02:00,499
"Emergency 252 (Part 1)"

9
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,999
Are serious, Conan?

10
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,699
You found the culprit at the Wimbledon Center and nabbed him?

11
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,699
Sort of...

12
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,599
What kind of case was it?

13
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,599
Yeah...

14
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,199
he was a vicious culprit who caused fear throughout London.

15
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,599
He blew up two hospitals!

16
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,399
Just as would be expected of the Grass Court Queen.

17
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,099
Nice centering to right in front of the goal!

18
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,699
My God...

19
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,699
You're really something!

20
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,099
I'll bet it made the news.

21
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,599
Not yet,

22
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,199
it seems a young boy from Japan shouted out loud

23
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,899
and the match was postponed it says...

24
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,799
Was that you?

25
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:01,499
Yeah, I did it inevitably to nab the culprit.

26
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:04,599
Well, I guess you can't really expose what happened, can you?

27
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,899
Because Conan Edogawa is a boy who can't enter Great Britain.

28
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:12,399
Yeah. Dad smoothly deceived everyone for me.

29
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,199
Oh! Kamen Yaiba!

30
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,999
Really!

31
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,799
This is the new figurine that is selling from today!

32
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,499
Yaiba is super awesome after all!

33
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:26,999
Really, it's so well made!

34
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,499
I want it, I really want it!

35
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:33,199
-There's the Laser Police over here too! -And? How was it?

36
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,299
I wish Ma would buy it for me...

37
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,799
You broke your promise with me, drank the antidote,

38
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,199
returned to Shinichi Kudo's body

39
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,299
and met the girl from the detective agency in London, didn't you?

40
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,099
Oh, yeah, thanks for the spare drug.

41
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,599
Don't tell me that you got carried away

42
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,599
and gave yourself away?

43
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,699
Huh?

44
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,699
No. Let me go!

45
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,199
You're such a nuisance!

46
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,699
Huh?

47
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,799
You're a nuisance of a difficult case to solve!

48
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,299
You've got so many extra emotions mixed up

49
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,299
that I wouldn't be able to make things out even if I were Holmes!

50
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,799
Especially when it comes accurately making out

51
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,899
what's going on inside the heart of the girl I love!

52
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,599
Let me tell you again,

53
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:37,899
that you have a body

54
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:41,199
that is capable of returning to normal only temporarily.

55
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,299
Under such conditions, what do you think will happen

56
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,699
if you give yourself away to her who's been waiting for you for so long?

57
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,499
You, yourself said so yourself sometime in the past, didn't you?

58
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,099
That she would miss you even more,

59
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,299
and that it would end up making her sadder.

60
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:58,899
I couldn't help it, could I? I couldn't stop it...

61
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,599
Don't forget, okay?

62
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:04,099
You're an existence that's prohibited from exposing yourself to the public!

63
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,499
You've got to stay hidden, until the time comes, understand?

64
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:11,799
What's this? Are you going to play hide-and-seek?

65
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,799
Let's play kick the can, then!

66
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:17,299
I've got the juice can that Genta just finished drinking up too.

67
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:20,499
Okay, then I know a good place to play!

68
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,799
Let's go...

69
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,899
Let's go!

70
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,199
See, it's this building, over here!

71
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,999
The other day, I came and went inside through the space between the shutter

72
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,999
and found no one inside.

73
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,999
It's amazing you found a place like this, Genta.

74
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,699
It'll be lots of fun playing kick the can here!

75
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,099
Yes!

76
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,999
If I remember correctly, this building is scheduled to come down next week.

77
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,999
But, how careless of them to keep the shutter open.

78
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,299
It's true!

79
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,399
The inside is practically all empty!

80
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,399
-See! -This is just the place!

81
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,599
Come on everybody who wants to play hide-and-seek whatevers...

82
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:17,999
Okay, hide!

83
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,399
Okay!

84
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,499
One,

85
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:27,699
two,

86
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,099
three,

87
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,499
four,

88
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:31,799
five,

89
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,399
six,

90
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,799
seven,

91
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,399
eight,

92
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,799
nine,

93
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,199
ten.

94
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,499
Geez. So, I end up being it after all.

95
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,599
Well, I did warn them to let me know right away

96
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,799
if they find anyone or anything suspicious,

97
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,499
so I guess I don't need to worry.

98
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:51,899
Playing once would probably satisfy them besides...

99
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,799
I guess I'll get it over with quickly then!

100
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,999
There! Found you!

101
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,199
He already found you, Ai?

102
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,799
Sorry.

103
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,399
Well, it can't be helped

104
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,799
because after all, the one who's It, has an almost devilish talent

105
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:15,299
for smoking out people who are desperately trying to hide themselves.

106
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,599
What a rude way to put it.

107
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,999
-I didn't mean to be. -The only one left is Genta.

108
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,299
It's just a matter of time.

109
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:26,499
The only places I didn't look are the third and fourth floors.

110
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,899
Genta is on one of those floors.

111
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,199
Hey, Conan.

112
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,899
It's Genta's voice.

113
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,699
Can you hear me, Conan?

114
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:36,899
What's up, Genta?

115
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,799
There's someone in this building!

116
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,899
Huh? What do you mean?

117
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,999
I heard a sound a while ago!

118
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,499
Like the wall being pounded or something.

119
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,599
Oh, there, again!

120
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,899
Hey, Genta?

121
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,799
There's the sound again!

122
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,599
Somebody is here after all!

123
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,399
Are you sure, Genta?

124
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,599
Yeah!

125
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,499
It sounds like somebody's pounding on the wall in the distance.

126
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,799
Do you hear that sound even now?

127
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:11,399
I don't hear it now, but...

128
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,499
First, I heard it twice, then next five times,

129
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:17,499
I heard two times again, and then it stopped.

130
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,599
252!

131
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,499
Someone is in need of rescue!

132
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:25,399
Isn't that the call code for the Tokyo Fire Department?

133
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,299
Big sis told me so the other day.

134
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,099
She said that if I remembered it, it may come in handy one day.

135
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,499
252 is the code used to notify that

136
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:35,699
there is someone who didn't escape in time,

137
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,399
or that someone is in need of rescue.

138
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,399
254 is a code that tells you to wait where you are.

139
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,299
If the sound that Genta heard was 252,

140
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,799
somebody must be calling for help.

141
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,899
No way.

142
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:53,599
At any rate, let's go to where Genta is.

143
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,999
We'll think things out after that!

144
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,399
Yes!

145
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,599
It was quiet?

146
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:19,399
You mean you heard nothing while we were coming here?

147
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,599
No.

148
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:24,499
I guess we'll just have to look into each room then.

149
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,799
Where did the sound come from?

150
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,699
Over that side.

151
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:34,799
Was it this sound?

152
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,599
Yeah.

153
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,899
But, it's not 252.

154
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,899
I guess we'll just have to check it out.

155
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:47,599
The sound's coming from the floor above.

156
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,699
It's coming from this room.

157
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,399
You guys stay back!

158
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,699
We can't be sure how things are inside.

159
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,199
What're you kids doing here?

160
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,399
No, no! You can't come into this building without permission!

161
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,399
What're you doing, sir?

162
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,999
We're going to be bringing this building down,

163
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,699
so we're checking on how strong the walls are by pounding on them!

164
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,699
Rhythmically, like so!

165
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,299
He always gets carried away and pounds in time to music.

166
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,599
Work seriously now,

167
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:52,699
because we've still got a lot of rooms to check yet.

168
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,899
Yes, sir.

169
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:58,199
Then, what about the 252 that Genta heard?

170
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,199
The rhythm of the music must've coincidentally been 252.

171
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:03,799
Gee whiz.

172
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,399
Say...

173
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,999
Are there only the two of you?

174
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:08,999
Yeah.

175
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,599
Right.

176
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:15,099
But aren't these the left-overs of the convenience store lunch boxes

177
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,799
you bought today for lunch?

178
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,299
There are three lunch box containers here, though?

179
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,899
Oh, he eats two lunches all by himself!

180
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,099
Yeah! I can eat for two just like that.

181
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,399
Hey, kids, this place is off limits, you know!

182
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,799
That's right, so get out of here quickly.

183
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,999
Okay!

184
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,699
Will do!

185
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,799
Hurry on home, and do your homework!

186
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,599
You can play after you're done!

187
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,599
Okay!

188
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,499
Let's go home, then!

189
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,799
Don't work too hard!

190
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:46,699
Oh, that's right,

191
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,299
may I just ask you one last question?

192
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:54,399
How much explosives are going to be used to bring this building down?

193
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,899
Beats me...

194
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,099
because we haven't finished checking yet, can't tell.

195
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:01,399
This building is pretty big,

196
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,799
so I guess quite a lot would be used.

197
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,299
I see! Then, it'll be a pretty big boom!

198
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,599
Yeah!

199
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,199
Come watch!

200
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,899
Okay, bye!

201
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,899
It turned out to be nothing after all.

202
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,299
Yeah, and I was expecting it to be a criminal case or something.

203
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,199
Well, let's come to watch,

204
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:25,499
all of us together when they bring down this building!

205
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:26,499
Yeah, let's watch!

206
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:28,499
It sounds great, doesn't it?

207
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:29,799
No.

208
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,299
I don't think they have such a thing

209
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,899
as bringing down the building using explosives.

210
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,499
When it comes to bringing building down,

211
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,999
the usual procedure would be to lift a heavy duty machine

212
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,599
on the top of the building start destroying the building

213
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:42,399
from the top or the side.

214
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,499
Even more so, when it comes to destroying buildings in the city.

215
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,099
But, I've seen on TV.

216
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,899
When they blew up a big building...

217
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,499
There's a big bang

218
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,799
and the building comes collapsing down really nicely, right?

219
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,499
That's an image of what they do abroad.

220
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,899
In Japan, there are only a few cases

221
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,199
where they blow buildings up and destroy them.

222
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,699
But, the Haido Museum was brought down Doc's bomb, right?

223
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,999
Yes, tropical rainbow!

224
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,399
It was really pretty, wasn't it?

225
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,399
Yes!

226
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,699
It was super awesome!

227
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,899
That method was allowed on that building

228
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,299
because it was combined with a special event and also

229
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:29,399
because there were only dilapidated vacant buildings in the vicinity!

230
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,299
All Doc did was rig the bomb

231
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:37,099
so that it emitted seven colors when the bomb exploded though.

232
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:41,199
And besides, that museum was much larger than this,

233
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,799
so if it were to be brought down by something other than using explosives,

234
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,599
they say the cost would've been too high.

235
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,599
Well, in Japan where the regulations

236
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,999
for handling explosives are so strict,

237
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,099
and being that there is an occupied building right next door,

238
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,699
it's utterly unthinkable

239
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,399
that this building would be brought down by blowing it up.

240
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,999
The amount of explosives to be used

241
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,799
would have to be measured precisely while checking it over

242
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,399
with the blue print of the framework of the building,

243
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,899
it's not the kind of work you can do

244
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,699
without bringing anything but a hammer along!

245
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:15,399
Then, who were those people?

246
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,599
People who were disguised as workers

247
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,599
who confined somebody in this building.

248
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,899
In other words, bad guys.

249
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,599
-What? -What?

250
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,199
Confined?

251
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,099
Yeah, because there were three lunch boxes.

252
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:31,199
So, there's no doubt that they're hiding there's one more person here.

253
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,199
But, they said that the fat man ate two lunches.

254
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,999
There were three used wooden chopsticks left.

255
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,099
If one person ate up two lunches,

256
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,399
he wouldn't open another set of chopsticks, would he?

257
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,999
Then the sound 252 that Genta heard was?

258
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,999
Probably someone who heard our voices playing Kick the Can,

259
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:55,799
and tried to send out an SOS by pounding on the wall.

260
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,299
The someone who's confined...

261
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,899
In other words, inside this building there's a "252"...

262
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,799
a person who needs to be rescued.

263
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,399
There's somebody in here that we've got to save!

264
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:19,246
In other words, inside this building there's a "252"...

265
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:21,346
a person who needs to be rescued.

266
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:23,946
There's somebody in here that we've got to save!

267
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,946
But, it's unbelievable that

268
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:31,246
the two would confine somebody in here.

269
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,946
They were both wearing the same kind of clothes, weren't they?

270
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,546
Can you get something like that ready right away?

271
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:39,646
They were wearing the same overalls to begin with.

272
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:42,546
So, that even if someone saw them come inside,

273
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:44,546
they wouldn't be suspected.

274
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:47,246
That way they'd look like workers of some kind, you see!

275
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:52,246
But, if the person who is caught is sending out "252", asking for help,

276
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:54,646
why not shout it out?

277
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:57,646
Probably because both his hands and feet are tied,

278
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:00,946
and his mouth is gagged.

279
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,346
If under those circumstances,

280
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:05,646
the most you can do is kick something and make a sound, right?

281
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,346
Then, since that sound can't be heard anymore, don't tell me that...

282
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,946
Don't worry! He's still alive!

283
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,746
If they killed the hostage,

284
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:17,246
they would've fled before we got to see their faces.

285
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:20,046
This is probably a kidnap case,

286
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:24,046
so it would be too risky to kill the hostage before the deal is settled.

287
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:27,446
I'm sure they probably knocked him out and locked him in somewhere.

288
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,246
Kidnap?

289
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,446
Well, don't worry yourself too much.

290
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:34,546
All we have to do is report this to the police, and the case is closed!

291
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:39,046
I guess we should call Officer Takagi who can understand things right away.

292
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,346
Huh?

293
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:43,046
Conan, your cell phone standby display is

294
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:45,446
the man at the detective agency!

295
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:49,346
Yeah, when Pops came back drunk the other day,

296
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:51,446
he fooled around with this and the standby display's been this way since.

297
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:55,046
Mine is of me doing sparklers!

298
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:58,146
I've got it in my school bag, so I'll show it to you later.

299
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,546
Mine is Kamen Yaiba!

300
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:02,146
How about you, Ai?

301
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,046
Doc's sleeping face.

302
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:08,546
Mine is of a stray cat living in the neighborhood

303
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:12,046
but I seem to have dropped it while playing kick the can.

304
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,546
-Oh, no! -Really!

305
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,546
Be quiet!

306
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,646
I'm going to call the police now.

307
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:21,146
Where did you say you were going to call?

308
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,746
What a brat.

309
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,646
He talks to us just for a short while

310
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:32,046
and sees through the fact that we're not real workers.

311
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:35,846
Yeah, we were on the verge of being taken in.

312
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,746
You can say that again.

313
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:41,346
We came here to talk to you in person in order to collect proof.

314
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:44,546
We've already contacted the police.

315
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,446
We already reported that somebody is confined here!

316
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,346
Right, Officer Takagi?

317
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:50,446
What?

318
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:53,846
Oh, come on.

319
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:56,146
There's no one there!

320
00:17:57,246 --> 00:18:00,146
-Darn it! -They split!

321
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,746
Okay then, we'll just have to catch them one by one!

322
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,946
Yeah, before they contact the police!

323
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:09,646
Hey, brat, where the heck are you?

324
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:11,446
Come out here you!

325
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:14,746
What makes you think they'll come out saying something like that?

326
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:17,146
If they're not there, they're in another room!

327
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,946
We better hurry, before they get us in trouble!

328
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:20,146
Yeah.

329
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,246
When in a fix, there's no place better than behind the door.

330
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:38,546
Now, hurry!

331
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,646
Okay, I'll call the police now.

332
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,546
Oh, no!

333
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:58,046
You guys go down the stairs and flee outside!

334
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,146
I'll be right behind you!

335
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:00,746
Okay!

336
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:07,146
You brat! Found you!

337
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,746
Before that...

338
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,046
First, I'll get this one!

339
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:16,646
Where's the brat?

340
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,046
What was that?

341
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,946
The door's dented.

342
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:31,646
Hey, look.

343
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,046
The brat's passed out.

344
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,546
I don't know what's happening but we're sure in luck.

345
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:41,446
Let's tie him up with masking tape and lock him up some place.

346
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,846
Yeah!

347
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,746
This brat seemed to be the smartest

348
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:47,346
and the one we would've had a tough time with.

349
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,246
Hey! The shutter's closed!

350
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:55,946
It won't open!

351
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,146
No joke!

352
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:00,746
It seems that the two kept in mind

353
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:04,746
the fact that we may flee before they came to get us and prepared for it.

354
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:06,946
Where's Conan?

355
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:09,446
He said he'd be right behind us, and yet...

356
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:12,446
Maybe Conan fell prey to the hands of the two men.

357
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,946
-What? -What?

358
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,646
We would inevitably have to come down

359
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:20,046
to the first floor here to get outside.

360
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:23,046
It's for sure that they'll be coming after us in a matter of time.

361
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,046
Let's hurry and call the police then.

362
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,946
I could call them, but...

363
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,946
before we finish explaining what's going on,

364
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:30,846
they may come and take the cell phone away.

365
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:34,346
Then, they'll explain to the police

366
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:38,046
that they were playing a police game or something and hang up.

367
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,146
In order to contact the police calmly,

368
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:44,446
we would have to pass them by one more time.

369
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:46,246
But, how?

370
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,646
Let's crack the window and go outside!

371
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,946
Impossible.

372
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:52,546
The windows are all blocked off

373
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,646
and the glass all have steel wires in them

374
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:56,646
and we couldn't possibly crack them.

375
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:59,446
Then, just what do we do?

376
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:02,646
Well, how about this?

377
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,946
Hey. Maybe we've already been reported?

378
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:08,946
Don't worry!

379
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:11,946
We can talk them out of whatever the kid said.

380
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:18,446
The bad people are here!

381
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:21,046
Don't dare come out everybody!

382
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,146
Does she think she's hiding or what?

383
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:26,046
I'll catch that brown-haired girl!

384
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,446
You go get the kids behind the pillar!

385
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,546
Yeah!

386
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:34,246
No, stay away!

387
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:36,146
Stay still!

388
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,546
Hey!

389
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:43,546
Hey! Only the school bags are here!

390
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:48,146
Don't tell me that brat used herself and the school bags as decoys

391
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:51,446
and let the other brats who were hiding elsewhere get away.

392
00:21:57,746 --> 00:21:59,046
Darn!

393
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:02,946
If they flee upwards, it'll be tough looking for them!

394
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,946
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

395
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:06,446
-Call the police, the police! -Hurry!

396
00:22:06,446 --> 00:22:08,746
It's calling now...

397
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:12,146
Hey brats! Can you hear me?

398
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,546
If you dare call the police,

399
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:19,646
the brown-haired girl and boy with glasses are going to die! You get that?

400
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:20,846
What?

401
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,246
Yes! 911...

402
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:26,446
"Calling" -Is something wrong? Is it an accident?

403
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,246
Hello?

404
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:34,846
What on earth am I supposed to do?

405
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:02,746
"Next Episode" -We've got no choice!

406
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:06,046
Let's set this place on fire and split.

407
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:09,146
But, things are looking really bad.

408
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:11,646
In order to get out of this fix...

409
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:14,046
I'll ambush them by the stairs

410
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:15,946
so, scare them with your voice, corner them

411
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:17,746
and we'll sandwich them from both sides!

412
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:21,446
Hey brats, come out here!

413
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:28,509
Next Conan, "Emergency 252 (Part 2)"

414
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,656
Next Conans Hint:

415
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,856
"Standby display of a cell phone"

416
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,156
I will protect you, Ai!

417
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,756
Unlike someone else I know, you're so courageous.
