1
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:02,836
It's Thief Kid.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,336
He's appeared just now, as he has declared he would!

3
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:08,736
Thief Kid!

4
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:10,136
He's come.

5
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:11,736
He's really floating in midair?

6
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:13,036
It... it can't be.

7
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:15,836
How and where on earth did he appear from?

8
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,136
Oh, no. It's started to rain.

9
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:22,336
Cover the equipment!

10
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:23,336
Rain?

11
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:25,536
Oh, no. It's raining.

12
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:27,536
What a time to rain.

13
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:29,136
Despite the sudden rain,

14
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:30,936
the call for Thief Kid goes on!

15
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:35,336
Hey, what's the matter? Chopper no.7, hey?

16
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,536
What is it?

17
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,636
The image from chopper no.7 was suddenly cut off.

18
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:42,836
This is chopper no.7. Everything's under control here.

19
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:46,936
The image probably temporarily went static due to the rain.

20
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:49,236
No. Maybe Thief Kid

21
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:51,236
is making one of his henchmen send out jamming waves,

22
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,236
and is up to something again.

23
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,536
Does Thief Kid have henchmen?

24
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,436
Yes.

25
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:59,536
It is reported to be an aged man or a young lady

26
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,736
or a lot of other characters.

27
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:04,636
But it's certain that he has at least one person helping him.

28
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:07,436
Hey, can you hear me, all men in the vicinity?

29
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:08,536
This is Inspector Nakamori!

30
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:11,736
Check on the double if there is anyone among the crowd

31
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:13,136
that is holding a jamming device!

32
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:16,136
That person may be Thief Kid's henchman!

33
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,236
He's walking!

34
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:20,836
Just like last night, Thief Kid has begun walking!

35
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:23,136
Advisor, please tell us what to do.

36
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:26,036
If things are left as is, he will surely steal the object this time!

37
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:28,836
I'm not going to let him steal anything right before my eyes.

38
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,636
Put the Blue Wonder inside for now!

39
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:32,636
Yes, sir.

40
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,136
It's his intelligence against mine.

41
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,736
Scratch, preconceived ideas,

42
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:38,936
wind.

43
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:41,436
Henchman.

44
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,936
I see. That's the story.

45
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:48,036
I've figured it out, Thief Kid.

46
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:51,736
The trick that you used to appear in midair, walk and vanish.

47
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:56,436
I've also figured out how you plan to steal Blue Wonder now, too.

48
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:58,336
Advisor,

49
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:01,736
we've completed putting Blue Wonder back inside the museum!

50
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:04,336
Okay, we're taking the initiative from here.

51
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:07,736
Turn off all the lights inside the museum right away!

52
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,136
All the lights?

53
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:11,236
Yes.

54
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:16,236
He could be monitoring the image within the museum, right?

55
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,236
Hey, doing something like that

56
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,436
is just what Thief Kid would love you to do.

57
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:23,436
Then, Inspector Nakamori, do you have a better idea?

58
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:26,436
Do you know how to stop the great thief

59
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:28,336
who has appeared out of nowhere as would a mountain hermit,

60
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:32,536
and close in on us walking in midair?

61
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:36,336
But just what do you plan to do turning off the lights of the museum

62
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,736
and taking the treasure inside?

63
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:41,336
In other words, the point is preventing him from stealing it.

64
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:43,536
If the Miracle of the Ocean, Blue Wonder

65
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:47,036
stays out of his reach, I win.

66
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,636
I'd like to make a proposal.

67
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:51,136
In exchange for giving you complete command of this situation,

68
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:54,936
I would like you to lend me a few of your men who can be trusted.

69
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,436
My men?

70
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,136
I'm accepting his challenge.

71
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,736
It's a secret strategy that I stayed up all night thinking up.

72
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:03,836
My dear Thief Kid!

73
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:07,736
My dear Thief Kid, my dear Thief Kid!

74
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:10,036
The helicopters have finally gone to the other side

75
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,936
giving me a good view of him, and with the wind out of my way,

76
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,636
I get an even better view.

77
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,636
But too bad he's so far away.

78
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,536
What the...

79
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:23,436
Thief Kid's less than 100 meters from his object of target Blue Wonder.

80
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,236
Hey, how're things on your side?

81
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:28,236
Perfect.

82
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:31,436
I'm sure that your strategy will outfox Thief Kid.

83
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:35,536
He may be wiretapping us,

84
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,336
so that's enough.

85
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,236
There's nothing to worry about,

86
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,936
the tricks are more than well set!

87
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,636
All we do is watch how everything turns out.

88
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,436
Hey, wait a minute!

89
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:47,936
Inspector!

90
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,636
There's something strange about Thief Kid this time.

91
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:52,836
What is it?

92
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:55,236
You see something that looks like a string?

93
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,236
Really?

94
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,336
Yes, a thing that looks like a thin string

95
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,136
is shining at his shoulders.

96
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:04,836
Hey, if that's true, then Thief Kid's not walking

97
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:07,136
but rather is being suspended from the helicopter?

98
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:09,336
Isn't there something strange about Thief Kid?

99
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:13,136
His legs are moving but it looks like he's being suspended to something.

100
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:16,536
Hey, chopper no.7 that is right above Thief Kid's head, respond!

101
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:19,636
Chopper no.7. Hey, chopper no.7?

102
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:30,136
He vanished. Thief Kid vanished right near the museum just now!

103
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,136
It's chopper no.7 after all!

104
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:34,236
His henchman that was on board chopper no.7

105
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:37,636
picked him up from within the curtain of smoke!

106
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:41,236
Hey, I hope all your choppers are numbered?

107
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:43,436
Yes, sir. Near the tail.

108
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:46,336
All the choppers patrolling the sky, do you hear me?

109
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,236
This is Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Department!

110
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:51,236
Thief Kid is on board chopper no.7 with his accomplice!

111
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:53,336
Report the position of chopper no.7 immediately!

112
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,336
Surround it until the police choppers arrive

113
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,036
and don't let them get away!

114
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:01,436
This is chopper no.14. Chopper no.7 verified

115
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,536
to be waiting at the main entrance of the museum!

116
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,336
Okay! Keep an eye on it and continue the pursuit.

117
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:07,836
Roger.

118
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,236
This is chopper no.35,

119
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:12,036
chopper no.7 is currently right above Shiodome Park.

120
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:16,336
Hey, hold it! Shiodome Park is behind the museum, isn't it?

121
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:17,936
Chopper no.28 here,

122
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:20,736
chopper no.7 has gone a long distance off from Shiodome.

123
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,336
This is chopper no.9. I verify two chopper no.7s

124
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:24,736
in the foreground of Shiodome Park!

125
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,336
Hey, what the hell is going on?

126
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:30,036
Well, the number "7" is written on almost

127
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,936
all the tails of the helicopters around!

128
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:34,436
Thief Kid probably did this beforehand.

129
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:37,036
Idiot! That can't be.

130
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,536
If such a thing were to be done,

131
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,236
somebody would've noticed when boarding the craft!

132
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:43,336
Inspector!

133
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,636
What is it?

134
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,036
There are strange silhouetted figures

135
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,636
in front of the entrance of the museum,

136
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,736
not just one or two figures.

137
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,036
They're the subordinates

138
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,736
that I let into the building a while ago.

139
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:58,736
Don't tell me that Blue Wonder is in the case

140
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,336
that the officer in the middle is holding?

141
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,036
Just what do they think they're doing?

142
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:05,336
It's like they're letting him know that he is carrying it.

143
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:08,236
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

144
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,536
Get in right this minute!

145
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,536
Don't worry, sir.

146
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:14,836
This case is empty anyway, and we're just decoys.

147
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,436
Decoys?

148
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:19,136
Blue Wonder was taken out

149
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,736
from the back door of the museum in a trash bag

150
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,636
by Jirokichi Suzuki disguised as a sanitation man.

151
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:37,136
What's so funny?

152
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,936
Thief Kid.

153
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:41,836
What a crazy thing to say?

154
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:46,136
I laughed because I was able to protect that treasure from Thief Kid.

155
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,836
You idiot. I saw right through you

156
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:52,536
the minute you came to the museum today on this motorbike.

157
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:56,536
Just like now, you didn't have your goggles on earlier.

158
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,636
It would be pretty difficult

159
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:00,936
for one wearing contact lens to ride a motorbike without goggles.

160
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,936
The wind would hurt your eyes and you'd be in tears.

161
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,336
That is, even if you had a windshield,

162
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:08,136
it would be difficult to ride a motorbike.

163
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,936
Well, despite being super-rich,

164
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,836
the old man goes riding around on this flashy motorbike

165
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,936
without any bodyguards.

166
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:17,036
You'd have had more than enough opportunity to put him to sleep somewhere

167
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,336
and switch places with him.

168
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:22,536
By the way, you took the dog Lupin that was riding in this sidecar

169
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:25,336
to a shade in Shiodome Park.

170
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,336
I'm pretty sure it's still asleep though,

171
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:29,936
because of the sleeping drug you made it sniff.

172
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,936
How could I be Thief Kid?

173
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,636
I was right beside you

174
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,936
when Thief Kid appeared just a while ago, too.

175
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:43,636
The same goes for last night when he miraculously walked in midair.

176
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:46,236
That was no miracle.

177
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,236
It's a simple trick that can easily be carried out with an assistant.

178
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,536
Although the men are efficient members of the Suzuki Financial Group,

179
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:54,436
they're not from the police or the military.

180
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,236
It shouldn't be too hard to mix one of your men

181
00:07:56,236 --> 00:08:01,036
among the bunch of professionals that were hired on a temporary basis.

182
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:05,536
You suddenly appeared last night in midair between the buildings

183
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:08,736
and brushed away our doubts about you having been suspended by something

184
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:11,536
by making a helicopter pass over your head.

185
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,836
After that, when the police and I ran up to the roof of the building,

186
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,536
all you had to do was make us confirm

187
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:18,736
that there were no wires connected between the buildings.

188
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:19,736
Since it would really make it look

189
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:21,836
as if you were floating in the air.

190
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,436
But if the pilot of the helicopter that flew over your head

191
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,736
were your assistant,

192
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,636
it's super easy to explain.

193
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:30,636
First of all, you fly on board the helicopter,

194
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,336
over to the two buildings you'll be using to carry out your trick,

195
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,036
and hook the tip of one side of the wire

196
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,936
onto the roof of one of the buildings.

197
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:41,636
Then, with the helicopter, you land on the roof of the other building,

198
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:43,936
hooking the wire onto the roof of that building.

199
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:45,936
You connect the wires from one building to the other,

200
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,936
then use the pulley that is attached to your body,

201
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,836
and move to the center.

202
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:51,736
Then you take off the black outfit you were wearing

203
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,036
together with the curtain of smoke, and dispose of it.

204
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,636
Then Thief Kid appears!

205
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,236
Your henchman comes immediately with the helicopter

206
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,936
and flies over your head.

207
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:03,636
The fish line-like thin wire that you connected yourself

208
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,136
to the helicopter with before getting off,

209
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,736
is pulled until it is taut and wound up!

210
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,536
After that you removed the pulley from your body

211
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,136
and made the helicopter swiftly collect the wire

212
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,436
that you hooked onto both buildings.

213
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:18,336
As a result, it would look as if you're floating in midair,

214
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:21,236
whether viewed from the top of the side.

215
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:23,636
Then, all that's left for you to do is to pretend

216
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,936
to walk together with the helicopter as it moves forward.

217
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:30,536
You used a tape recorder to create the sound of footsteps,

218
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:35,036
matching the sound from it with your stride.

219
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:37,536
In order to deceive people from thinking that you're being suspended,

220
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,536
you used exquisite body performance.

221
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,436
After walking a while, together with the curtain of smoke,

222
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:44,736
you abandoned your white clothes

223
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,236
and moved the position of the searchlight.

224
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,936
The helicopter pulls you up on board,

225
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:51,136
so it looks as if you vanished in midair.

226
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:54,036
Well, tonight's Thief Kid was merely a walking doll

227
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:56,536
that caught the attention of the police.

228
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:58,236
You were probably just pulling the doll in and out of the helicopter

229
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,536
together with the curtain of smoke.

230
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,736
All it was doing was hanging in the air,

231
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,636
so it was more than obvious that it was just a doll.

232
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,936
But, sonny you already climbed the building

233
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,736
that Thief Kid was on, didn't you?

234
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,536
If something was suspended from the helicopter,

235
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:11,636
no matter how thin the string, it would've been seen.

236
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,836
No, because of preconceived ideas and the wind.

237
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,236
Talk about wretched.

238
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,636
The moment the helicopter flew above your head,

239
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,836
I was convinced that you weren't being suspended.

240
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:26,036
I was flustered when I didn't find the wire on the roof,

241
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:28,636
and didn't notice that string.

242
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,636
But, the marks were surely left behind

243
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,336
on the roofs of the two buildings.

244
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,236
The marks left behind by the hooks that you hooked on beforehand,

245
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:37,636
when the wires were collected by the helicopter.

246
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,936
But sonny,

247
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:42,336
you saw the video of Thief Kid last night again and again, didn't you?

248
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:44,236
Although it also depends on the resolution,

249
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,736
if the string is as thin as a fishing line,

250
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:47,836
you would have to be very near and view it with the naked eye.

251
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:50,636
It'd be virtually impossible to view it on the monitor.

252
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:53,336
The only way the string would show is the down shot image

253
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,136
of Thief Kid when the string comes to the foreground,

254
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,836
and the only one who could've filmed this

255
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,036
is helicopter no.7 piloted by your henchman.

256
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:00,436
If you sent the image that was previously

257
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,536
used for airing a special program on the museum,

258
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,536
and you added the image of Thief Kid onto it

259
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:08,936
and made it look as if helicopter no.7 sent it,

260
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:10,936
the string wouldn't be there.

261
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,836
That's why when it began to rain,

262
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:16,036
your henchman stopped sending the image, right?

263
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:17,636
Because on the aerial image back then,

264
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:21,136
there was no one using umbrellas!

265
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:23,236
The flashy demonstration you put on last night

266
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,936
was to make everyone think that you were coming from the sky,

267
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,736
and loosen the tight security on the ground.

268
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,236
You probably did so since you planned to disguise yourself

269
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:31,736
as Jirokichi Suzuki and come through with no check.

270
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,336
But, you goofed,

271
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:36,036
when you came with no goggles on

272
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,436
and that image was clearly on the TV screen.

273
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,536
No, it's not that I came with no goggles,

274
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,536
rather, I couldn't put them on.

275
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,836
Because my disguise would come off!

276
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:50,136
Aren't you worried about your comrade that's on board helicopter no.7?

277
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:53,936
I'm sure the police have surrounded his craft by now.

278
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:58,036
No need to worry, because the police are probably panicked.

279
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,336
They're probably flustered by all the no.7 stickers

280
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,736
on the helicopters.

281
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:03,636
All the stickers?

282
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,036
I see.

283
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,636
You stuck the stickers of the real numbers

284
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:10,836
of the helicopters over the no.7 stickers.

285
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,636
But the stickers of the real numbers were pasted on very lightly

286
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,536
so that the wind would easily blow them off.

287
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,536
Yes.

288
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:20,036
Therefore, the pilots of the helicopters go on board

289
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:22,736
totally unaware that they would be mistaken for being my henchman

290
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,136
and chased around.

291
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:27,236
In the meantime, my comrade splits amidst the commotion.

292
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:31,836
Indeed the great escape of the miracle of the vast sky, Blue Wonder!

293
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,036
The vast sky?

294
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:36,236
The blue of Blue Wonder is the blue of the ocean, you know.

295
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,736
It's the same thing.

296
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:41,336
The blue of the ocean is the reflection of the blue of the sky, right?

297
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,636
It's the same as the detective and the thief.

298
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,736
We seem as different as are heaven and earth.

299
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:46,736
However, if we trace back to the root of the matter,

300
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:49,336
we both force open the door to what people want to keep secret,

301
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,736
using the key of curiosity.

302
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,136
We're both nothing more than two rude men.

303
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:56,336
You idiot. The sky and the ocean are blue

304
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:58,036
due to totally different qualities of the dispersion

305
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:00,836
and reflection of light.

306
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,536
They're not to be thought of as the same!

307
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:05,536
As proof of that, the water in puddles is not blue, is it?

308
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,736
What a drab, wet blanket. You've got no dream.

309
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:11,536
I can't see through the truth chasing after dreams, you see.

310
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:15,536
Are you really thinking of nabbing me with that tranquilizer gun?

311
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:18,936
If I fall asleep at this speed, we're going to have an enormous crash.

312
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:22,236
Don't worry, I won't shoot until this motorbike stops.

313
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,936
And, as for your custody, I already contacted Inspector Nakamori,

314
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,236
who should be on his way here.

315
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:28,036
I'm not stopping.

316
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:31,436
Beside, remember what Gramps Jirokichi was bragging about?

317
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:36,936
This motorbike is rigged with an acceleration function.

318
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,836
See you, great detective.

319
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:43,036
I'll leave that treasure to you.

320
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:46,036
I wasn't after that treasure, to begin with.

321
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:49,336
Besides, all I did was take him on because he challenged me.

322
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,336
That punk.

323
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,736
You've got no dream.

324
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,936
Idiot. Of course, I do.

325
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:12,636
I've got dreams I want to realize too, you know.

326
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:20,336

Right.

Why? Conan's the one who protected the treasure, right?
