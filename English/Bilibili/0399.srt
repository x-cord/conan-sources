1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,340
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,040
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,440
Sense of vision, hearing and smell.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,940
An alibi relying on these three senses.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,740
The clue to invalidating the alibi is a past incident!

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,825 --> 00:02:01,925
"Request from a Queer Family (Part 2)"

10
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,225
In other words, the suspects are...

11
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:07,625
Daisaku, the family head that confined in his room blowing the flute,

12
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,725
Tsugutaka, the oldest son who was illustrating

13
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:14,725
and the second son, Shigehide who was writing a novel.

14
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,425
These three men.

15
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,625
No. Up to now,

16
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,525
all the deductions were made based on Conan leading everyone to them.

17
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,925
It's as if the thoughts that cross an innocent child's mind

18
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:27,225
coincidentally serve as hints to reach a conclusion,

19
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,225
but it can only be done

20
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:32,025
because he is secretly having Shinichi make the deductions.

21
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,125
Even up to now,

22
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:37,325
I've never seen him making phone calls before coming up with an idea.

23
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,125
If so, there is only one thing I can think of.

24
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,325
That this child...

25
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:42,625
Conan himself...

26
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,225
is Shinichi.

27
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,225
That's why all the calls from Shinichi come in with no number display.

28
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,725
So that I can't call him from my side.

29
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:56,525
But during the school festival, they were both together.

30
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,625
Am I taking my imagination too far after all?

31
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,725
No, don't be deceived!

32
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:04,925
I'm sure Shinichi used some kind of trick!

33
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,825
What's the matter, Ran?

34
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,825
No, it's nothing.

35
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,225
I see.

36
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:11,925
I've got to make sure.

37
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,025
Come to think of it, right after I sent the mail to Shinichi,

38
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,825
Conan's cell phone...

39
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:20,425
I'm going to send that mail once more.

40
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:21,725
And this time for sure...

41
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:26,525
I'll get hold of conclusive evidence that he can't get away with.

42
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,025
No way.

43
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:33,825
It's not responding.

44
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,525
A visitor?

45
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,025
Were you expecting somebody?

46
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,825
No.

47
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:41,825
It says my mail's been sent.

48
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,825
So what happened this morning was a coincidence after all?

49
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,025
Well, I guess so.

50
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,625
Conan couldn't possibly be Shinichi.

51
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,025
No, it's Shinichi!

52
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,525
He could be using some method

53
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,925
that is unthinkable for ordinary people to think up.

54
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,625
If you're going to be that way,

55
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,125
I'm not going to take my eyes off you,

56
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,525
not even for an instant, until you expose yourself.

57
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,125
So, you'd better be ready, Shinichi!

58
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,025
I wonder if it's just another prank?

59
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,025
A prank?

60
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:10,125
There are times when the doorbell rings, but there's no one there.

61
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,425
But it's really bad today. It's already happened several times.

62
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,525
It usually happens only once a week.

63
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:19,325
But it's already this time of day to be a prank by children.

64
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:23,525
One of the three probably rang the door chime using some method,

65
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:27,025
and rigged up some alibi trick while the door was being answered.

66
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,025
It's true that the alibi of the three

67
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,625
is being supported by the housekeepers who brought their dinner

68
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,125
during the time of the crime, which was around 7:30.

69
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,025
But they did not directly see any of the three.

70
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:42,025
If so, the most suspicious would be Tsugutaka,

71
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,725
the husband of Tomoko who had been killed.

72
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,625
If he saw the mail in her cell phone

73
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,225
that came from the one she was having an affair with,

74
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:49,725
that would be a motive, too.

75
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,025
If Mrs. Kariya was having an affair...

76
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,225
I don't think Mr. Kariya would have overlooked it.

77
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,125
Why do you think so?

78
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,325
12 years ago when Eisuke, his third son's fiance

79
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:03,925
was killed in the phone booth,

80
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,925
they were actually on a date.

81
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:09,425
The first phone call was from Eisuke asking him if it was okay

82
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,825
to let Motoka spend the night over because she had missed the last train.

83
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,025
Mr. Kariya who was in the living room

84
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,125
asked for Motoka to come on the phone.

85
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:21,725
If a girl like you ever dare come through the door of the Kariya residence,

86
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:23,425
I'll see to it that you do not live!

87
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,525
Was Motoka also having an affair?

88
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,925
I don't know how Mr. Kariya found out, but...

89
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,425
I think they both stayed at the phone booth

90
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,925
without being able to make it home and was killed there.

91
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,925
Was the police notified?

92
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:39,325
I only know that there was a phone call.

93
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:42,125
Shigehide told us that it had nothing to do with the case,

94
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,625
so that it wasn't necessary to report it.

95
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,825
Which means that the only person

96
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,525
that had nothing to do with Tomoko was Shigehide.

97
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,525
About that...

98
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:56,125
We heard Tomoko and Shigehide arguing in the corridor a month ago.

99
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,525
Something about "It's terrible to eavesdrop."

100
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,525
It was about the dialogue of the parents of the main character

101
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,525
that appear in the novel which is to be dramatized soon...

102
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,225
Being very similar to their own.

103
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:09,225
Mrs. Kariya was outraged saying that if the dialogue is not changed

104
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,825
before the dramatization, she would sue him.

105
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:13,125
As a result, Shigehide agreed to change the dialogue

106
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,125
and everything seems to have been settled.

107
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,125
What? You're all still here?

108
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,925
Did you find the killer?

109
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,125
Oh, not yet.

110
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,625
By the way, at around 7:30 when your dinner was delivered to you,

111
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,025
you answered through the sliding paper door,

112
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:31,225
"It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner."

113
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,225
But how did you know it was curry?

114
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:36,725
The aroma. The sliding door was slightly opened.

115
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:39,225
What's this used for?

116
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:43,125
I use it to listen to my flute teacher play and practice.

117
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,225
I'm making process day by day.

118
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:46,825
Now that I don't go out often,

119
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,725
playing the flute is my only favourite pastime.

120
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:55,725
So ever since he hurt his leg at work, he haven't gone out much.

121
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,525
Yes, since he used to stay at home all the time,

122
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:02,025
he found out that his wife was having an affair with someone else,

123
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:03,625
and got a divorce.

124
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:08,925
I see. That's why he is very sensitive to extra-marital.

125
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:12,525
Curry was one of the dishes that his wife was good at.

126
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:15,025
That's why you didn't make curry too often?

127
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,125
Out of consideration for Mr. Kariya.

128
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,925
Yes, we were actually thinking of making beef stew.

129
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,625
But we decided to change it to curry just 10 minutes before serving it.

130
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,925
Hey, come on! That's enough.

131
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,825
I just told you that I was in this room at night around 7:30!

132
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,725
When you were served dinner, you raised your hand and responded.

133
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:36,325
She saw your silhouette through the sliding paper door

134
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,225
but she didn't actually see you in person.

135
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,525
You mean you think I rigged it so that my silhouette

136
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,325
would be reflected on the paper door?

137
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,425
No.

138
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,325
I don't think that's possible.

139
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,125
I can tell whether it is actually the silhouette of a person or not.

140
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,325
I see.

141
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:50,525
So now that you're done, go on home, will you?

142
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,725
Thanks to you police people, I haven't been able concentrate,

143
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,025
and haven't made any progress in my work!

144
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,925
One of his family members has died

145
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,125
and yet he doesn't shed a tear at all.

146
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,725
It's a wonder he's a writer of pure love novels.

147
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,325
He sure doesn't look to be one.

148
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,525
Talking about not looking to be one,

149
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:09,625
when we first met them you were saying...

150
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,625
Hey, Ran?

151
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,825
What?

152
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,525
You were saying that you thought he was much older.

153
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,525
That's because the people who come out in his novels don't dye their hair.

154
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:24,225
Even if people with dyed hair come out, they're treated as delinquents.

155
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,425
That's why I thought he was pretty old.

156
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,625
Besides,

157
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,225
his story usually has scenes in which the main characters are at the place

158
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,625
they're supposed to meet, and yet, they don't get to see each other

159
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,925
because a pillar is in the way. Just like in some old movie.

160
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,425
It's so sad watching the characters waiting and worrying,

161
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:40,725
concerned about their loved ones that don't show up.

162
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,625
They're so different from somebody I know,

163
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,325
that's always close by, yet insists on secretly watching his partner.

164
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,025
You think so too, don't you, Conan?

165
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,425
I can't really tell because I'm just a child.

166
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,725
You think so, don't you?

167
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:55,825
Yes.

168
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,425
Enough.

169
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:01,725
I have nothing more to say than that I was here, right through.

170
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:05,625
But smelling the aroma of the pipe when dinner was brought here

171
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,925
is not enough to serve as proof of an alibi.

172
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,625
Then who was smoking the pipe?

173
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,525
Are you saying that there was Ninja or something around?

174
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:12,725
A Ninja?

175
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:15,725
You ate the curry.

176
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:18,825
By the way, did somebody come again?

177
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,625
I heard the doorbell ring a while ago.

178
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,525
No. It seems that somebody played a prank again.

179
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:29,825
I think that Tsugutaka is quite upset over this prank.

180
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:32,225
Each time he returned from outside,

181
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:34,925
he used to ask if any pranks were played.

182
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:38,125
When we told him there were, he used to get into a foul mood.

183
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,925
And he used to get really upset over crank calls, too.

184
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:42,925
Crank calls?

185
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:45,125
Yes, it rings once, and hangs up.

186
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,625
It rings for some time and then hangs up. We were getting strange calls.

187
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,125
We got a one today, too.

188
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,625
When you came, a little after 8:00.

189
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,925
Was it an undisplayed number?

190
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:55,225
No, the thing is...

191
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,425
Although the phone call came in

192
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,725
it wasn't displayed in the incoming call history.

193
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:00,725
Don't tell me that the chime we heard just a while ago?

194
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,125
Hey, Ran!

195
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,525
What?

196
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,925
You sent mail out a while ago, didn't you?

197
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:06,925
You did, didn't you?

198
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:08,925
Yes, I did!

199
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,225
Is that wrong?

200
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,125
Did you verify the address?

201
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:15,725
I didn't have to verify it because all I did was re-send the mail

202
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,125
I sent out this morning.

203
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,025
Oh, no.

204
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:20,925
Who did I mail this out to?

205
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,625
Just as I thought after all.

206
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,625
That's why she found the cell phone so easily.

207
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,425
Which means that person is the killer.

208
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,925
The killer used the case of 12 years ago

209
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,025
to hide his shadow within the dark.

210
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,325
So that he alone could continue to stay in the light.

211
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:45,488
I guess it's about time we call it a day then.

212
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:46,488
Yes.

213
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:47,688
I think it'll be difficult to undo their alibi

214
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,288
unless we use some sort of magic.

215
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,888
Magic?

216
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:55,388
I saw a fantastic magic show on TV the other day!

217
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:59,088
This lady is in a rectangular box.

218
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:02,788
Her face, hands and legs are sticking out, but her body splits into three.

219
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,188
Talk about shocking!

220
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:08,088
You idiot! There are three people in there.

221
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:10,888
Really? I guess you can't deceive people carrying it out alone,

222
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:13,788
but if there are others to help you, it's possible!

223
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,288
So what?

224
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:21,388
If one of the three helps out, then the alibi trick will work?

225
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,888
It's not possible,

226
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:27,388
because the meals were delivered to three rooms that are apart.

227
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,388
For some reason,

228
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:33,788
Mrs. Kariya finds the cell phone that she had lost in the house,

229
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,288
and as soon as she does so, she is killed.

230
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:40,188
The three men who live in this house are to be suspected, that's for sure.

231
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:44,388
Yes. The cell phone was also missing from the scene of the murder.

232
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:46,088
But, Ran...

233
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,888
Don't you think that the person who is hiding that cell phone

234
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:50,588
-is really stupid? -Huh?

235
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:52,888
Because while we were looking for the cell phone,

236
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:54,688
no matter how many times we called,

237
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:57,188
the person kept answering and hanging up right away, right?

238
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,688
Of course.

239
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,888
Because once his voice is heard, it would be obvious who he is.

240
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,888
But if it were me,

241
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,488
if I knew that such an in convenient phone call would be coming,

242
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:08,588
I would switch off my cell phone.

243
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:13,988
Which means that Shinichi did have his cell phone switched off?

244
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,388
You idiot!

245
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:19,388
He was waiting for Tomoko's man to call or mail her,

246
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,188
that's why he didn't switch off her phone.

247
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:24,888
If so, he could've adjusted the volume of her cell phone.

248
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:28,288
Because he was getting repeated calls.

249
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:32,488
Or, was it that he didn't know how to operate the phone?

250
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:34,188
I'm sure he knew what he was doing

251
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,288
because he knew how to unlock the cell phone.

252
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,588
But even if the cell phone were to be locked, it would be obvious

253
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:42,288
that four digits would have to be entered in order to unlock the phone.

254
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,088
Therefore, even if the killer had no idea how to use the phone,

255
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:47,088
so long as he had time, I'm sure he would've been able to unlock it.

256
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:50,588
Anyone can find out how to use it by just touching it here and there.

257
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:52,788
It took me a while to get used to it though.

258
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:56,988
You're talking about back when you first bought your cell phone, right?

259
00:12:56,988 --> 00:13:00,288
Right, right. There aren't too many people who do not know

260
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,088
how to use a cell phone in this day and age.

261
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:05,388
If that person were to be locked up somewhere for about 10 years or so,

262
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,688
then maybe...

263
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:07,688
10 years?

264
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:08,788
Come to think of it,

265
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,588
the use of cell phone became widespread about 10 years ago.

266
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:14,888
Hey, wasn't it about 12 years ago?

267
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:16,588
That the third son Eisuke's fiance was killed

268
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,288
and his whereabouts became unknown?

269
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:23,588
Could it have been Eisuke that had Tomoko's cell phone?

270
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:26,288
Don't tell me that he's somewhere in this house?

271
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:30,288
Which means that one of the three was hiding him.

272
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:31,588
It's understandable

273
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:34,588
that after being separated from the outside world for 12 years,

274
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:38,688
he finds the cell phone and becomes interested in it, and takes it away.

275
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,188
It was after all,

276
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:43,588
Eisuke's friend who got a call from the cell phone that was lost.

277
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,788
If it were him,

278
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,388
he probably had a lot of time to figure out how to unlock the phone.

279
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:50,288
And when he went to return the phone, Tomoko found him,

280
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,288
so he killed her along with whoever was hiding him

281
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,788
in order to keep her from talking.

282
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:57,088
The alibi would become invalid.

283
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,088
Okay! Go get a search warrant.

284
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:03,588
Eisuke could be the killer of the incident that happened 12 years ago.

285
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:05,388
Yes, sir.

286
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:08,088
The problem is, who's sheltering him?

287
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,888
I think the most suspicious is the head of the household, Daisaku.

288
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:13,088
There was a radio cassette recorder in his room, right?

289
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:15,788
He probably recorded his voice,

290
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,788
"It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner."

291
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:22,388
And at the time of the crime around 7:30, he made Eisuke

292
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:26,088
that he was sheltering push the button in order to establish his alibi.

293
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:30,188
I think I'm kind of hungry.

294
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,488
Would you like to have some curry? There's still some more left.

295
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:36,788
No, it's okay. It was supposed to be beef stew, right?

296
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,388
And you changed it to curry 10 minutes before you served it, right?

297
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:41,688
-So, I'll bet it's not that good anyway. -10 minutes ago.

298
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,588
Means about 7:20.

299
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:47,588
It takes more than 20 minutes to the murder site from here.

300
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:52,788
He'll have to leave by a little after 7:00 to make it in time.

301
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:56,188
Then it's Tsugutaka who was smoking his pipe in the room

302
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,288
and illustrating in his room.

303
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:01,988
As for the aroma from the pipe, all he had to do was make Eisuke smoke it.

304
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:05,488
Curry is my favourite, so maybe I'll have some after all.

305
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,488
Huh?

306
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,288
In fact, I was thinking of taking the curry that was outside the man's room

307
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,388
somewhere else and eat it.

308
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:14,688
But I decided against it.

309
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,388
Because if the plate of curry disappears,

310
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:19,188
it'll be easy to figure out who ate the curry!

311
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:20,488
Wait a second.

312
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:24,388
If Tsugutaka made Eisuke stay in his room to serve his double,

313
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:27,188
why didn't he make him take the curry into his room?

314
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:28,988
That would make it look more like he was in the room.

315
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:31,788
He probably couldn't come out

316
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:34,188
because he's someone that shouldn't be around.

317
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:38,188
Even so, Tsugutaka would've noticed the dish after coming back

318
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,188
from the murder site and would've taken it inside.

319
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,088
If he left it outside his room,

320
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:44,488
it would only give way to suspicion

321
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,888
that he wasn't in his room during the time of the crime.

322
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:51,188
Besides, Tsugutaka had eaten the curry after it had gotten cold.

323
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:53,288
There is no reason why he wouldn't take it into his room.

324
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,188
If so, the remaining suspect would be

325
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,288
the one who was writing a novel in his room,

326
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,788
Shigehide.

327
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:04,188
I killed Tomoko?

328
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,388
I'm sheltering my kid brother Eisuke?

329
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,188
You've got to be kidding!

330
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:11,788
But if so, everything falls into place.

331
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:16,088
You made Eisuke have his hair done like yours.

332
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,988
Then you make him respond through the sliding paper door

333
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:19,188
isn't all that difficult.

334
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,388
Mr. Tsubouchi from the editing section.

335
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:27,188
I'm sort of busy right now.

336
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,588
Yes. I'll call you back.

337
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,988
You're mean, aren't you, mister?

338
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,388
You use a cell phone,

339
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:37,888
but you don't let the characters in your novel use it.

340
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:40,488
Why don't you let them use it?

341
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:43,388
It's not that you didn't know about cell phone, right?

342
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:44,488
It can't be.

343
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:47,188
Were you making your kid brother write the novels?

344
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,988
That's why there weren't too many people who dyed their hair in the novel.

345
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:53,888
12 years ago, not too many people used to dye their hair yet.

346
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,088
Which means it's true

347
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:58,688
that the conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Kariya were used, too.

348
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,688
If he lives in the attic,

349
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:02,888
he'll be able to hear all the conversation that goes on in the house.

350
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,388
Well, that's...

351
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:07,788
It's enough already.

352
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:10,588
It's enough,

353
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:11,588
Shigehide.

354
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:13,588
You're...

355
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:16,888
Yes. I'm Eisuke Kariya, who killed my fiance 12 years ago

356
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:20,188
and was being protected by my older brother all this time.

357
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:23,688
Because of the words of my father that I heard back then through the phone.

358
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:27,988
If a girl like you ever dare come through the door of the Kariya residence,

359
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:29,488
I'll see to it that you do not live!

360
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:34,588
We got into an argument, I lost my temper and killed Motoka.

361
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,088
I was planning to kill myself, too.

362
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:40,888
But I was in shock and found myself at home when Shigehide found me.

363
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,988
Shigehide, I'm in trouble, I killed Motoka.

364
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,388
Don't worry! I'll work something out.

365
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:47,388
And you've stayed in the attic ever since.

366
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,388
Yes. I thought of turning myself in many times,

367
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,788
but just couldn't find the courage to do so.

368
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,788
I had no intention of killing her.

369
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:58,088
Then why did you hit her after you stabbed her?

370
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,388
You hit her, didn't you?

371
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,588
No. I only stabbed her.

372
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:07,188
So it's you who killed Motoka 12 years ago.

373
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,488
What the...

374
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,288
Wait! Why would Shigehide kill Motoka?

375
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:16,888
Maybe because he was the one who was having an affair with Motoka?

376
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,888
I see! If it's an affair within the same household.

377
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,488
It's understandable that Daisuke who didn't go out often

378
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:22,688
would find out about it, too.

379
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:27,388
Yes. And you killed Tomoko who found out about it to shut her up.

380
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:29,688
Using the same method you used 12 years ago.

381
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:33,288
You figured if push came to shove, you would put all the blame on Eisuke.

382
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:34,888
That's ridiculous.

383
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:38,288
Shigehide protected me for the past 12 years.

384
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:41,588
No. He protected you because if the police arrested you,

385
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,388
everything would be disclosed!

386
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,888
The fact is that, after you stabbed Motoka,

387
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:48,988
he killed her with a finishing blow!

388
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:50,788
That's not true, right?

389
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:54,188
No. Why would I do something like that?

390
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:56,488
I remember Mrs. Kariya saying

391
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,888
that the ringtone of the cell phone was a strange one.

392
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,088
Shut up. Be quiet!

393
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:02,888
If you want to set me up as the killer that badly,

394
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,788
show me proof that I did it.

395
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:08,488
Guests again?

396
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,388
No, I think it's the sound for incoming mail.

397
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:17,488
Mrs. Kariya disappeared while looking for the cell phone, remember?

398
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:20,788
She had my cell phone at that time,

399
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:23,588
so she sent mail to her cell phone repeatedly

400
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:26,688
and found her cell phone with the sound of incoming mail.

401
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:27,788
I see.

402
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:30,988
No matter what button I pushed, I couldn't stop this sound.

403
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:33,888
I got all flustered when Tomoko showed up at the attic.

404
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:36,088
I was able to stop the sound of the cell phone, but...

405
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:43,288
The ringtone is the same as that of the Kariya family.

406
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:45,688
I see. If left that way, no matter where in the house you are,

407
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:48,688
you will have an excuse to leave. So you can answer the call or e-mails

408
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,188
from the one you're having an affair with.

409
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:55,288
And the fact that the sound is ringing now

410
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:57,788
means that the cell phone is somewhere in this room.

411
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:01,188
Shigehide, the cell phone that you took from the scene of the murder,

412
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:03,788
Tomoko's cell phone.

413
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,188
You should've thrown it away immediately.

414
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:12,288
He was probably too scared to throw it away

415
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:16,288
until he confirmed whether or not she told anybody about his kid brother.

416
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:19,388
Well, the truth will come out as soon as we check out the fingerprints

417
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:20,688
on the murder weapon and the blood on it.

418
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:25,488
If only she didn't say what she did.

419
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:28,188
Where do you think I found this cell phone?

420
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:31,588
Your very curious kid brother had it.

421
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:34,688
The one inside the dark attic, made to write novels to past his time away,

422
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,788
so that his older brother could get all the glory,

423
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:39,588
that poor kid brother of yours.

424
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,888
Okay. To start things off, give me 10,000,000 yen.

425
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:45,788
We'll talk over the details thoroughly in a different place.

426
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:49,788
That's why you told me to write the novel here tonight and went out?

427
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:52,288
Yes. 12 years ago, too.

428
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:56,288
I first went to see if she was okay because she was stabbed.

429
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,388
Her wound was not serious,

430
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,588
so I was going to take her to the hospital. But...

431
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:01,888
Take responsibility, will you?

432
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,288
Take responsibility and get married to you?

433
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:04,588
You idiot!

434
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:07,488
I would never marry into a house with such an old fart living there.

435
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:09,088
Money!

436
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:11,388
Now that things turned out the way they did,

437
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:12,888
I'm going to leech you till you die and suck you to the bones,

438
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,488
so be prepared!

439
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:16,988
Shigehide.

440
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,088
I'm not worthy of being your brother.

441
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:22,488
If you didn't have the writing talent you did,

442
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:25,788
I probably would have killed you the first chance I had.

443
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:27,288
Shigehide.

444
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:29,488
Well, I guess I didn't do so

445
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:35,788
because I wanted to read the continuation of your novels.

446
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:05,188
But what a queer family they were.

447
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:06,288
You were really fantastic, Pops.

448
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:07,988
You solved the case in no time at all!

449
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,188
Well, it was really no big deal.

450
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:12,888
You're fantastic yourself, Shinichi.

451
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:15,788
Acting out as a slightly intelligent grade school child. How splendid.

452
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:20,988
You're a big centre forward manipulating a small mid-fielder.

453
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:25,288
A fantasista who sends accurate passes and leads the ball to the goal.

454
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:26,588
But why?

455
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,288
Why are you doing this?

456
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,788
Why won't you tell me the truth?

457
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:32,988
I mean we're so close together.

458
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:34,288
Why?

459
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:37,688
We're finally home.

460
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:39,988
Hurry up and get off!

461
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:41,488
I've got to go return the car.

462
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:42,488
Okay.

463
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:47,988
Ran, hurry up.

464
00:23:48,988 --> 00:23:50,888
Make sure you have the bath ready!

465
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:00,888
"Next Episode"

466
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:02,688
I guess he sort of realize it after all.

467
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,988
That I'm suspicious of his true identity.

468
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,088
A married couple who gets along great.

469
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,288
Shinichi, what numbers would you prefer?

470
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,588
If I remember it correctly...

471
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,788
What did Shinichi answer?

472
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:18,988
I can't remember.

473
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,988
There's only one way I can find out.

474
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:29,588
Next Conan, "Suspicious Ran"

475
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,515
Next Conan's Hint:

476
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,715
"The number plate of a car"

477
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:36,215
The next episode is the 400th episode!

478
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:39,519
-A new start in history for you, Conan. -Sure thing.
