1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,470
Pops Kogoro and I headed for the hotel

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,770
to have a talk with spirit detective Gaito Hotta.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,470
But Gaito Hotta was found murdered

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,470
in a room in that hotel.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,770
Moreover, in the room next door...

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,970
Gosh, who is it?

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,070
What's with all the noise?

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,970
You're...

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,170
Huh? You're the guy from the detective agency.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,170
Masumi Sera.

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,170
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,470
Is Masumi the only one in the next room?

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,670
The case turns a deeper shade of black.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,370
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,870
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:41,927
"The Spirit Detective's Murder (Part 2)"

19
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,327
By the way,

20
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:49,227
did this wine belong to Mr. Hotta who was staying in this room?

21
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,527
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:53,227
He said he was planning to see someone,

23
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:57,227
and asked to have snacks and wine glasses for two, which I brought here.

24
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,527
I see.

25
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:02,127
Do you have any idea who that someone was?

26
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:04,227
Not at all.

27
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,927
But this room sure is hot.

28
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,127
It sure is hot.

29
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:11,927
Although it's sort of chilly today,

30
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:14,127
it's not that cold that you need to use a heater.

31
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:18,327
Well, if it was done to shift the ETD of the corpse,

32
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:23,027
this bedroom where the corpse is, should be heated to the max,

33
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:25,127
but on the contrary, the window is opened on this side

34
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,227
and it is rather cold.

35
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:29,027
And Mr. Mouri,

36
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:33,127
did you really see somebody flee from the window?

37
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:35,327
Yes, sir! I saw it clearly with these eyes of mine.

38
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,927
Somebody fled from the veranda just now!

39
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,627
Come to think of it, when that window was opened,

40
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,927
a gust of wind blew!

41
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,927
A gust of wind?

42
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:52,927
That's probably because I opened the front door, I think.

43
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,627
If a suspicious person came out of the room,

44
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:58,127
I wanted to take a picture using my video camera, you see.

45
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:00,627
Why didn't you keep the door closed?

46
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,227
The perp would flee, right?

47
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:07,727
But if I don't let him flee, I'd be attacked, wouldn't I?

48
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,527
True.

49
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:15,327
So, the glass fell to the floor blown by the wind.

50
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,427
No.

51
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:20,327
The glass fell when we opened the front door

52
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,927
and that was before the bedroom door was opened.

53
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,427
Hey, Conan.

54
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,527
I see.

55
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:28,127
When you found the corpse, was that bellboy there too?

56
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,227
Yeah.

57
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:34,327
At first, Pops Kogoro and I came here with Mr. Kokuri,

58
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:37,327
but since there was no answer after ringing the doorbell.

59
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,227
Huh? This is strange.

60
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,727
He's supposed to be in his room.

61
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:47,627
After this, Mr. Kokuri realizes that

62
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:51,027
he received e-mail from Mr. Hotta an hour earlier

63
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:52,727
and checked his mail.

64
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,127
What?

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,727
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

66
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:01,827
So he went to get the bellboy to unlock the door.

67
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:03,927
Really?

68
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:07,127
And the bellboy opened the door right away?

69
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:09,327
No. When he was about to open it...

70
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:10,927
Wait!

71
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,827
An incoming call.

72
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:14,627
Hello, Mr. Hotta?

73
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,627
Are you Mr. Hotta?

74
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,727
I'm sorry. It was a wrong number.

75
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:21,427
I'll open the door then.

76
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,727
Okay.

77
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:26,027
And when he opened the door...

78
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,827
How about it?

79
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:32,027
Did I explain things well enough? To you know who?

80
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:33,227
What?

81
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,227
Who's that somebody, anyway?

82
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:38,027
More importantly,

83
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:41,827
I want to see the part above the window of the veranda.

84
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,227
Okay.

85
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,127
Here goes.

86
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:54,127
How about it, Conan?

87
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:57,127
Yep. It's a bit sticky, though.

88
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:59,327
Like something was pasted on above the window.

89
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,827
I see.

90
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,227
You found a trace of something pasted above the window.

91
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,327
You two!

92
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:09,227
What are you doing there?

93
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,427
Get out of there!

94
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:15,527
Which means that something was pasted on the window

95
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:19,427
but made to blow away when the door was opened?

96
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:24,227
See, because air flows from the warm to the cold, right?

97
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:26,727
But even if something were to have been pasted on,

98
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:30,027
I don't think that the wind would suffice in making it come off.

99
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,727
And even if it did come off,

100
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:36,227
the thing that blew away would have to fall somewhere.

101
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:37,927
You're right.

102
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,227
But, well...

103
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:44,027
Either way, the perp is probably Mr. Kokuri for sure.

104
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:51,927
Inspector Megure, we'll be going then.

105
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,627
Good work.

106
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:56,927
What's this?

107
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:58,427
What's the matter?

108
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,727
Did you find something?

109
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,027
No. When I came inside to use the bathroom,

110
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:06,827
the lid of the toilet opened on its own and I was surprised.

111
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,527
Using the restroom at the scene of the crime...

112
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:14,027
There are a lot of those toilets around these days!

113
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:16,127
-Really? -Yes.

114
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,627
They are equipped with sensors

115
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:20,527
and when people approach, it opens automatically.

116
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:25,827
Opens automatically with sensors...

117
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:28,727
Automatically... With sensors...

118
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:31,527
With sensors...

119
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,927
Okay, let's go then.

120
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:42,727
Huh? Mr. Hotta mailed me an hour ago.

121
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,227
What?

122
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:47,127
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

123
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,527
I'm sorry. It took me a while to explain.

124
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,527
Wait!

125
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:55,727
An incoming call.

126
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,227
It was a wrong number.

127
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:00,227
Mr. Hotta?

128
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:06,327
Somebody fled from the veranda just now!

129
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,027
There's a car parked right below the veranda.

130
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,227
Why is it parked in a place like that?

131
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:14,827
I see. I get the picture.

132
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,227
Hey, Masumi.

133
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,827
Deliver, what?

134
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,527
Gosh!

135
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,527
I've got no choice.

136
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,527
Pops.

137
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,827
I have something I want to show you.

138
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:32,027
Huh? What is it you want to show me?

139
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,627
Just come!

140
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:34,927
Gosh.

141
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,127
The forensics have finished doing their thing already

142
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,427
so there's nothing to see anymore.

143
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,427
Okay. All set for the Sleeping Kogoro!

144
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:53,827
It's kind of dangerous because Masumi's here.

145
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,427
All I have to do next is use the bowtie voice changer,

146
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:59,427
use Pop's voice and deceive everybody...

147
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:03,527
What?

148
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,027
Crap!

149
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:07,427
The voice changer's missing!

150
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:16,594
Crap.

151
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:20,294
I must've dropped my bowtie voice changer somewhere!

152
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:24,594
Without it, I can't perform my Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

153
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:27,094
And I already put Pops to sleep.

154
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:28,594
Mr. Mouri?

155
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:30,994
That pose, don't tell me that...

156
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:34,394
You've figured out the case, right?

157
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,694
Mr. Mouri?

158
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:39,594
Maybe he's really asleep.

159
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:43,394
I think he's just thinking.

160
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:46,594
Gosh. Why on earth is he doing so in that position?

161
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:54,494
This case would be an easy one for Masumi to solve, but...

162
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,594
Okay!

163
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:59,294
She doesn't know about Mr. Kokuri's car, though.

164
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,494
Conan.

165
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,494
Do you want me to help you?

166
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,094
You're in trouble, aren't you?

167
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:08,494
Not really. I'm not in trouble.

168
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,394
How about Pops Kogoro?

169
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,094
Do you need help?

170
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,394
Answer me.

171
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,894
It looks like he's really asleep.

172
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,194
Wait!

173
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:21,594
Sleep is a biological condition of

174
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:25,494
the periodically repeated loss consciousness.

175
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:28,694
-In other words, it is virtually impossible... -It's Pop's voice.

176
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,094
for people to talk when they are asleep.

177
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:31,694
The smartphone is behind his neck?

178
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,294
Of course, there are exceptions like sleep talking.

179
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,194
Where on earth?

180
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:38,394
The words I'm speaking now must sound

181
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:42,694
like senseless sleep talking to you.

182
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:45,094
But since they are the words of the detective

183
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,694
who has solved this ridiculous case,

184
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:50,294
I ask you to listen.

185
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:51,694
-So, you've figured out the case after all? -I get it!

186
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,494
She's using my voice changer from behind the curtains.

187
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:54,794
However, his tone of voice is different.

188
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:56,094
Gosh!

189
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,894
Don't get in the way.

190
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,394
I prefer to be brief,

191
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,494
so I'll get right to the conclusion.

192
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,594
The man who stabbed and murdered spirit detective Hotta,

193
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,694
or whatever his name is, in bed,

194
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:17,894
and made it look as if the killer fled the scene when we arrived is...

195
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:21,294
over there, TV Director Kokuri!

196
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,994
But you said that

197
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,494
the dishes fell to the floor when you opened the front door,

198
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:33,194
then you followed the footprints of the foot

199
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,894
that stepped on the spilt wine

200
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,394
and opened the door of this bedroom,

201
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:41,994
then saw somebody flee from the window.

202
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,994
Construction was underway back then on the floor below,

203
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,294
so it may have shook slightly,

204
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:50,994
but the odds the dishes would've fallen are 50-50.

205
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:53,194
So, it doesn't seem appropriate to use as a trick.

206
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:55,894
No, it was 100 percent!

207
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:59,594
It was impossible for the dishes not to fall!

208
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,294
Impossible?

209
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:03,394
Excuse me.

210
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,494
Yes?

211
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:09,094
I brought the wine glass, wine bottle, plate and salt

212
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,394
that you'll be using for the investigation like Detective Mouri told me to.

213
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:13,994
What?

214
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:20,894
First, set the plate on the very edge of the table.

215
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:24,094
Then pour a large amount of salt next to the plate

216
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,994
towards the center of the table!

217
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,394
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:31,394
I poured the salt!

219
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:34,294
Then stand the wine glass up on top of the salt,

220
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:37,594
so it's leaning towards the plate.

221
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:40,694
Place the wine glass... tilted...

222
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:41,894
The wine glass is standing.

223
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,194
With the wine glass standing, blow away the salt.

224
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:47,894
Don't blow too strong and make sure the glass doesn't fall.

225
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:53,394
Amazing!

226
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,794
It's still standing!

227
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:57,794
Right. The glass is left standing

228
00:12:57,794 --> 00:13:01,194
by just a few grains of salt.

229
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:04,694
Finally, place the bottle against the base of the glass

230
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:06,794
and shake the table.

231
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:11,094
The glass becomes unbalanced. The bottle blocks the glass,

232
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,594
which inevitably falls towards the plate.

233
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,294
Then the glass falls together with the plate onto the floor.

234
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:23,394
If broken plates and glasses are placed under the table beforehand,

235
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,394
all the objects will crack due to the impact

236
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:27,394
as well as make a lot of noise.

237
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:30,994
What was that sound?

238
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:33,194
It sounded like something cracking.

239
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,194
By spilling wine on the floor

240
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:39,194
and creating wine stained footprints leading to the bedroom,

241
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:44,494
it would look as though the killer rain into the bedroom.

242
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:47,494
Furthermore, you created a difference in room temperature

243
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,494
between the living room and the bedroom by turning on the heat.

244
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,694
By doing so, when he door of the bedroom is opened,

245
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:54,794
a breeze would blow through,

246
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:59,294
scattering the small pile of salt that remained on the table.

247
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:00,794
You feared that

248
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:03,794
even a small amount of salt found on the bottom of the glass

249
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:09,294
could lead to the police to figure out your trick.

250
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:12,594
I see! He used that breeze

251
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:16,194
to blow away whatever was stuck on the window frame of the bedroom.

252
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:19,994
And created the illusion of someone having fled from the bedroom!

253
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,794
Are you nuts?

254
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,594
Just think about it!

255
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,894
How could just a mere wind blow something

256
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,494
that's pasted onto the frame of the window away leaving no traces behind?

257
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,094
Let's say it came off.

258
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:34,494
But are you saying that

259
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:38,294
the thing that blew off vanished with nobody seeing it?

260
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,794
Then, how?

261
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:44,294
A thin fishing line was attached to the door.

262
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:47,694
It was rigged to come off when I opened the door.

263
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:51,794
In other words, a cloth of the same color

264
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:54,394
as the curtain on the window frame of the bedroom was attached.

265
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,894
Then that line was pulled through the door

266
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,994
and taped onto the window frame of the veranda.

267
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,894
And on the tip of the line

268
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:03,394
that was pulled through a weight was attached,

269
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:06,294
and suspended from the railing of the veranda.

270
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:09,194
When the door is opened and the fishing line comes off,

271
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:10,394
the cloth that was attached falls

272
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,994
because of the weight attached to the line.

273
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,894
This would give the illusion of someone having fled from the veranda.

274
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:17,594
A stupid trick!

275
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:22,594
But the cloth that fell... Wouldn't it be found by someone?

276
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:23,894
Masumi.

277
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:25,194
Masumi?

278
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:27,794
I don't think you saw,

279
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,594
but Kokuri had his car parked right below the veranda.

280
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,294
His car with a roof that opens and closes, a convertible, that is.

281
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,494
The switch for closing and opening the roof

282
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,994
can easily be put on the key if you ask for it.

283
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:45,794
If you keep holding the button of the switch down

284
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,394
and attach it to the weight that is suspending

285
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:49,094
from the railing of the veranda...

286
00:15:57,194 --> 00:16:00,894
Simultaneous to the cloth falling, the roof of the car closes.

287
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,594
Just the car that is parked in a strange place is left behind!

288
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:08,094
By the way, this trick does not work

289
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:10,494
unless he gets me into this room at 9:00 sharp

290
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:14,294
when the construction stars.

291
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:19,494
That's why the perp set his cell phone to ring a minute before 9:00.

292
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:22,294
Wait!

293
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:24,194
An incoming call.

294
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:26,094
Hello, Mr. Hotta?

295
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:28,194
Are you Mr. Hotta?

296
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:31,494
I'm sorry. It was a wrong number.

297
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:33,294
By doing so,

298
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,394
the timing in which the bellboy uses the key

299
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,594
to open the door can be controlled.

300
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:43,594
If the e-mail asking for help was sent by the victim an hour earlier,

301
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,494
the victim was probably killed at that time, too.

302
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,594
In this country where earthquakes are frequent,

303
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:53,694
it'll not be reasonable to keep the salt trick as if for many hours.

304
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:58,094
If so, it should still be in his car,

305
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:00,694
the heavy weight and cloth that he used for the truck, of course,

306
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:04,294
as well as the murder weapon he used to kill Hotta

307
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:06,694
and clothing splattered with blood.

308
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,594
Yes.

309
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:14,894
The blood splattered clothes are still in the trunk of the car.

310
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:19,794
Together with the knife I used to punish that guy

311
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:22,694
who dared to expose my younger sister's corpse to public view.

312
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:24,994
Your younger sister's corpse?

313
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,594
Several years ago,

314
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,594
my younger sister killed herself on a certain mountain.

315
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:32,494
A death note saying that she hung herself

316
00:17:32,494 --> 00:17:35,294
after going through the shock of a heartbreak.

317
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:39,094
But no matter how hard I looked, I couldn't find her corpse.

318
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,594
And yet!

319
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:42,494
On a TV program,

320
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,494
Gaito Hotta declared that on a certain mountain

321
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:49,094
he smelled death of a different person from the one he was searching for

322
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,894
and discovered the corpse of my younger sister

323
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:53,094
that was buried under the soil.

324
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:55,194
Do you see what I'm getting at?

325
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:59,294
Despite having found my younger sister who hung herself,

326
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:01,094
that guy buried her in the soil

327
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,694
without even reporting to the police!

328
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:04,794
He put on this performance

329
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,694
just to show what spiritual powers he possessed!

330
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:11,694
That's why I...

331
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,294
Gosh!

332
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:20,494
She went back to the room next door.

333
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:24,494
Okay. Let's hear the rest of what you have to say at the station.

334
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,794
Not yet.

335
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,594
I've got to tell her.

336
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:30,494
I've got to go report to my sister's grave

337
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:34,994
that I punished the man who put her death to shame.

338
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:37,394
Hey!

339
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:42,494
Hey!

340
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:45,394
Crap! In the next room, there's...

341
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,594
Who are you?

342
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,394
Gosh!

343
00:18:58,394 --> 00:18:59,794
Move out of my way!

344
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:06,994
Is he dead?

345
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:13,494
No. She accurately hit his vitals and struck him out cold.

346
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:16,694
In the few seconds that it took me to get here

347
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:20,194
with the speed comparable to that of the secret service...

348
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:23,294
The one who did this is... is without doubt...

349
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,894
The untouchable...

350
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,294
Mom!

351
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:31,394
No. Are you okay, Conan?

352
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:32,994
Yeah.

353
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:35,394
Mom?

354
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,494
Well, it's you all right, Mom.

355
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:47,694
To be able to use Conan's bowtie device right on the spot!

356
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:52,194
Yeah. There was a mark on the dial, you see.

357
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:55,994
He was probably using the voice of that detective a lot.

358
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,694
How amazing though...

359
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,394
that the voice of so many different people can be mimicked

360
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,994
with such easy manipulation.

361
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:06,394
I was able to imagine using it in a variety of situations.

362
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:08,394
It's so exciting.

363
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,994
I guess so.

364
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,494
You don't look all that excited, though.

365
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:16,794
And?

366
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:20,694
Did you find out what information Hotta got a hold of?

367
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:21,694
Yeah.

368
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:25,294
Just before being taken to the polite man called Kokuri was saying

369
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:28,594
that somebody saw the bodyguard Asaka who disappeared,

370
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,894
with the hand mirror.

371
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:35,994
It seems that Hotta found out that Asaka was a woman.

372
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,594
He was going to summon the spirit of Koji Haneda

373
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:44,394
and make him scream, "It's a woman! I'm going to be killed by a woman!"

374
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,194
So, that's it? Trash!

375
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,294
More importantly, start packing.

376
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:50,694
We're moving out.

377
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:52,094
What? Already?

378
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:53,294
I was thinking how lucky I was

379
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,394
that I could finally tell Conan what hotel I was staying at, and then...

380
00:20:58,394 --> 00:21:01,594
No one knows Conan's true identity.

381
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,194
Always keep on your guard when around Conan Edogawa.

382
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:09,894
He's a totally different person from the boy we met 10 years ago.

383
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,394
Okay.

384
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:36,994
Asaka's a bodyguard and a woman.

385
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:41,494
If that person is the number 2 of the Black Organization, Rum...

386
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:45,094
Then maybe the one that Ai referred to as an effeminate man

387
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:49,794
is a woman, but one who is as strong as a man inside.

388
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:52,894
If that person was a bodyguard 17 years ago,

389
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:55,794
I'm sure he or she is quite aged by now.

390
00:22:55,794 --> 00:23:01,194
If like me, that person's age rewound to being in intermediate school,

391
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,994
the most likely one would be...

392
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:06,994
The woman that Masumi referred to as Mom.

393
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:09,994
I wonder who she is?

394
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,494
Come to think of it, boss...

395
00:23:17,494 --> 00:23:19,594
It seems he croaked Gaito Hotta,

396
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:23,594
the one who was snooping around about the murder of Koji Haneda.

397
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:29,694
I could care less about the job that Rum goofed on 17 years ago.

398
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:33,294
What bothers me more is the Sleeping Kogoro.

399
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:39,294
It seems that he was involved in solving that case this morning, too.

400
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:43,394
It's not clear what his true identity is

401
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:45,494
but if he's someone deemed to be of danger to us,

402
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:48,294
we've got to kill him while he's asleep.

403
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:56,194
"Next Episode"

404
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:57,494
Call the police!

405
00:23:57,494 --> 00:24:00,094
What? You let it go?

406
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:02,994
You idiot! You don't have to come!

407
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:04,294
Madam...

408
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:10,494
My, what's this party for?

409
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:14,494
Who of the three murdered Naoko?

410
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,294
So, that's the story after all!

411
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:24,294
Next Conan, "A Foul-Mouthed Myna Bird"

412
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:27,237
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:29,237
"A potted plant"

414
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,137
By the way, bro...

415
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,337
-What? -Nothing.
