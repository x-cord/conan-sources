00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,270
Dad! I told you to wait until after dinner to drink beer.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,070
You always fall asleep when you drink.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,970
You never help clean up.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,270
Shut up. I need more than one drink

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,070
after all the unbelievably hard work I did today.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,870
Hold on. Dad.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,770
You may not understand

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,970
but this is my only joy right now.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,470
Yeah... Wait until after dinner, though.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,170
Hello, Mouri residence.

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,670
Officer Takagi.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,070
Yes, Conan's here.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,470
The truth is...

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,570
What? Conan is a witness in a murder case?

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,970
When the countdown reaches zero,

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,470
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,570
A shocking phone call from Officer Takagi!

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,570
What do I have to do with the case?

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,470
His name is Detective Conan!

"The Youth Detective Squad Become Models"

24
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,311
I'll summarize the case.

25
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,211
Please do.

26
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:20,811
"Seiho Kitasono (72)" -The victim is Mr. Seiho Kitasono, 72 years old.

27
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:23,311
He died when he was struck in the back of the head.

28
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:26,711
We believe the weapon was the plaster bust over there.

29
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,811
Mr. Seiho was famous in the world of Japanese painting.

30
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,111
He acted as the chairperson on judging committees

31
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:35,111
for various exhibitions.

32
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,211
His estimated time of death is around 3:30 pm.

33
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:43,311
His body was found by his apprentice, Mr. Kengo Higashio.

34
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:46,411
It was around 3:50 pm when Mr. Higashio entered the studio

35
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:49,611
and found Mr. Seiho on the ground,

36
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:52,711
bleeding from his head.

37
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:56,811
Mr. Higashio then left the studio and returned to the house,

38
00:03:56,811 --> 00:04:00,111
where he reported what he found to housekeeper Ms. Shizu Minamida.

39
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:04,611
At the same time, Mr. Seiho's wife, Mrs. Kinuko, returned home.

40
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,811
They confirmed Mr. Seiho was dead,

41
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:11,911
and Ms. Shizu called the police at 3:58 pm.

42
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:17,611
Later, his other apprentice, Mr. Daiki Nishiyama, arrived.

43
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:21,711
He arrived after us around 5 pm.

44
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,111
I see.

45
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:28,411
Then why is Conan a witness in a murder case?

46
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:29,511
Well...

47
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,711
It's already finished.

48
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,511
It's Conan and his friends.

49
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,611
This is the painting that Mr. Nishiyama, the artist who came late,

50
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,311
was working on at Okuho Lake today.

51
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:46,611
We had Conan come to confirm the time.

52
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:52,611
I think we met Mr. Nishiyama around 11 am.

53
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:56,711
But we left after about 15 minutes of sketching,

54
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:01,811
so I don't know how long Mr. Nishiyama was painting there. But...

55
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,011
But he finished this painting.

56
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:09,311
He must've been there for a while.

57
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,511
He's right.

58
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,011
Well, officer. How is it going?

59
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,011
Have you figured anything out?

60
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:20,111
We're still gathering information.

61
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,811
Nothing so far.

62
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:25,211
"Kengo Higashio (33)" -In any case, Mr. Kitasono wasn't someone

63
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,011
anyone would've hated enough to kill.

64
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:30,011
Oh, my. So you say.

65
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,111
"Kinuko Kitasono (60), Kitasono's Wife" -But, Higashio,

66
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,611
aren't you the one who killed my husband?

67
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,911
Why would you say that?

68
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:42,511
You resented him for not recommending you

69
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:44,811
for the teaching position at the Beika Art School.

70
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,011
This is ridiculous.

71
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:52,611
In that case, weren't you fighting with your husband

72
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:55,511
over the money you were throwing at a young host?

73
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,211
You're more suspicious than I am.

74
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:02,911
Let's not discuss this right now.

75
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:05,911
"Shizu Minamida (55)" -Mr. Kitasono just died.

76
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:07,511
Seriously, Nishiyama?

77
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:10,411
You're suspicious as well.

78
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:15,011
My husband told you he'd select your piece

79
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:17,011
to win an exhibition if you paid him.

80
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,711
"Daiki Nishiyama (26)" -Maybe you killed him

81
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,511
because you couldn't afford it.

82
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,611
I would never!

83
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:27,311
Let me ask again.

84
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:32,011
When Mr. Higashio arrived, the door wasn't locked, correct?

85
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:34,911
Yes. Normally it's locked,

86
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:38,311
but on days like today when he knew we were coming,

87
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,211
he sometimes left it open.

88
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:44,811
According to forensics, the windows were unlocked.

89
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,111
Yes.

90
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,911
He did sometimes work with the windows open.

91
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,111
Working with oil paints

92
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,111
will fill a room with the smell of paint and oil.

93
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:57,111
I see. But he would've noticed immediately

94
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:01,311
if a stranger entered through the door or windows.

95
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,611
Not necessarily.

96
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,511
When he was caught up in his work,

97
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:10,911
he'd forget to eat or use the bathroom.

98
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:15,511
By the way, was there anything valuable in the studio?

99
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:17,911
I'm not sure if they were valuable,

100
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:20,811
but my husband kept a few of his paintings there.

101
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,711
Even if anything's missing, I wouldn't know.

102
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:29,011
At the very least, they'd probably sell for a few million yen.

103
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:31,411
One million yen?

104
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,211
Sorry.

105
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,911
To be accurate, a few million.

106
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:41,511
His larger pieces are worth close to ten million.

107
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:47,011
Which means it may have been a robbery.

108
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,711
Once again,

109
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:53,011
during the estimated time of death between 3:10 pm and 3:40 pm,

110
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:55,811
where were all of you?

111
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:59,311
I was at home all day today.

112
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:03,411
I left after 3 pm and drove here.

113
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:05,711
I went out before noon.

114
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,211
I ate at the Beika department store

115
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:11,511
and visited two other department stores after that.

116
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:16,611
I was on the train from Okuho Lake to Beika City.

117
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:23,011
I left just before 3 pm to go shopping at the nearby supermarket.

118
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:26,711
I returned about five minutes before Mr. Higashio arrived.

119
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:31,611
I see. Do you have anything or anyone

120
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,411
to verify your alibis?

121
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:37,011
-Verify? -Our alibis?

122
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,111
But how can we verify...

123
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,711
You were there this afternoon.

124
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,611
Yeah. You already finished the painting of us.

125
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:48,711
Yeah. I was arrived late because I was working on that.

126
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,911
I'd like to show the others.

127
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:53,111
Can I take a picture?

128
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,011
Of course. Oh, right.

129
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:58,411
That reminds me.

130
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:02,611
Officer, this is a picture I took at Okuho Lake Station.

131
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,311
Does this verify my alibi?

132
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,711
It's certainly clear that you took it at Okuho Lake Station, but...

133
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:14,011
If it'd included the time, it would've verified your alibi.

134
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,611
I see.

135
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:17,811
Let me see.

136
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,211
Sure.

137
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,511
Huh? Look at this.

138
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,411
If you enlarge the sign

139
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:33,211
"Train Departure Time" -behind Mr. Nishiyama... See?

140
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:39,411
That's right. I took the 2:02 pm train back.

141
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,911
From Okuho Lake Station to here...

142
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:45,011
It takes close to two hours.

143
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:48,811
So he's probably got an alibi.

144
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,011
In any case,

145
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:54,211
we're also considering the possibility of theft as we investigate,

146
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,311
but to be on the safe side,

147
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:59,811
we're checking everyone's alibi.

148
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:02,311
We appreciate your cooperation.

149
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:11,311
I can't believe you four are tagging along.

150
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,211
Tagging along? How rude.

151
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,711
We're helping you with your investigation.

152
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:20,511
We remember when he asked us to be his models.

153
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:23,311
Since he has the painting and photos of the station,

154
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,311
Mr. Nishiyama's alibi is as good as verified.

155
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,911
It won't take long.

156
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,611
Yeah, but...

157
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,011
Why are you suddenly dropping in?

158
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,011
We appreciate your cooperation.

159
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,011
What do you want?

160
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:43,911
After canvassing the Mitsuboshi and Marukawa department stores

161
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:48,111
you claimed you visited,

162
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:51,811
we found no one who said they saw you there.

163
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:55,811
Naturally, we checked the security camera footage as well,

164
00:10:55,811 --> 00:11:00,311
but we couldn't find you anywhere during that time.

165
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:06,411
Between noon and 4 pm yesterday,

166
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,711
why don't you tell us

167
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:11,411
where and what you were actually doing?

168
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:16,411
Aohata Station. For Okuho Lake Station, transfer to...

169
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,111
-Look. -So many mountains.

170
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:24,711
Who is it?

171
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:31,711
Mr. Higashio. You said you were at home yesterday at 1 pm,

172
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,811
but the deliveryman who came to your place said

173
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:37,111
no one answered the door.

174
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,811
Oh, please. I was here.

175
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:43,511
I don't like to be seen in my pajamas,

176
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:44,811
so I didn't answer.

177
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,211
I see.

178
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:50,511
We'd like to ask you more about that.

179
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,611
Could you come down to the station with us?

180
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:57,011
"Okuho Lake Station"

181
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:59,711
See? It's just like we said.

182
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,111
That sign that shows the destinations changed

183
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,011
the moment the train started moving.

184
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:08,811
He only could've gotten on at 2:02 pm.

185
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,611
The station attendant said the same thing.

186
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:17,511
Sir, when does the sign switch to showing the next destination?

187
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:22,411
It changes automatically when the previous train departs.

188
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:27,111
After all, Japan has the most punctual trains in the world.

189
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:30,211
The man who made that painting is a good person.

190
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:32,611
You got that, Officer Takagi?

191
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,311
This is Takagi.

192
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:38,911
It's me.

193
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,411
Where are you?

194
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:43,511
Well...

195
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,411
Sorry, Inspector. We just arrived at Okuho Lake.

196
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:51,911
I see. We were able to confirm the housekeeper Ms. Shizu's alibi.

197
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,611
We learned his wife, Mrs. Kinuko,

198
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:58,411
was visiting a male host around that time, too.

199
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:02,911
We're just waiting for confirmation on Mr. Higashio and Mr. Nishiyama.

200
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:07,011
Got it. I'll let you know the moment I learn anything.

201
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:11,511
That's where we got the drawing done.

202
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:15,011
It's right here.

203
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,511
Let's see.

204
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:20,311
It certainly looks exactly the same.

205
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:24,411
Of course it is. It's only been a day.

206
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:27,411
Genta wouldn't lose weight

207
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:30,611
or Conan wouldn't grow in a single day.

208
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,011
By the way, I've been wondering since yesterday.

209
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:38,411
How did you end up being his models?

210
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:41,211
There was a dog here.

211
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:46,411
How cute.

212
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:47,911
What's your name?

213
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:50,811
Are you kids in grade school?

214
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:51,811
Yes!

215
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:54,711
We're first-years at Teitan Elementary School.

216
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,311
Are you on a field trip today?

217
00:13:56,311 --> 00:14:00,611
That's good! Would you like to model for me?

218
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,511
I see. So that's what happened.

219
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,311
Do you get it now?

220
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,611
The four of us can verify his alibi.

221
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,911
Okay...

222
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:16,011
Since his alibi's been verified, we can go now.

223
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:20,111
What? We came all the way here, and we're leaving already?

224
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,311
Let's have some fun first.

225
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,911
We can't. We didn't come here to play.

226
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,811
"Train Departure Time. 14:02 - Aohata"

227
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,411
I see. You're sure, then?

228
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:39,011
Yes. Mr. Nishiyama has an alibi.

229
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,711
That just leaves Mr. Higashio's alibi.

230
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,411
Officer Sato's talking to him now.

231
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,611
I see.

232
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:52,111
I'm hungry. I can't take another step.

233
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:53,811
Okay...

234
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,311
I'll buy you something while we're waiting to transfer.

235
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:00,511
That's not good enough. I want eel.

236
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:04,511
Since we're in the mountains, they'll have wild eel.

237
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:07,711
Wild eel?

238
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:10,811
Lucky me.

239
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:15,611
I get to be interrogated by a beautiful officer.

240
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,311
Hurry up. The train's leaving.

241
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:25,611
This and this and I don't need this, but I do need this.

242
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,811
I'm sorry!

243
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,311
I lied!

244
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:46,511
Wait...

245
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,911
Are you all right?

246
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:50,011
Thank you.

247
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:52,411
"Train Departure Time"

248
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,011
Officer Takagi, look!

249
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,011
Huh?

250
00:15:58,511 --> 00:15:59,811
This is...

251
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,278
Why are we going back?

252
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,378
Are we going to play?

253
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:17,478
There's something I need to check again.

254
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:21,078
Something you need to check?

255
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,778
You didn't notice?

256
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:24,178
Notice what?

257
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,278
The sign at Aohata Station changed,

258
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,578
even though the train hadn't left yet.

259
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:31,578
What?

260
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:34,978
In other words, if the same thing happened

261
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:38,078
when Mr. Nishiyama took that photo,

262
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,578
then Mr. Nishiyama could've boarded the previous train.

263
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,478
This is Takagi.

264
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:50,578
We confirmed Mr. Higashio's alibi.

265
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,478
He was with a married woman at the time.

266
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,978
Could it have been an intruder?

267
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,478
Forensics is saying

268
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:03,378
there are no signs someone entered from outside the house.

269
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,578
What? Yesterday?

270
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:11,178
Yeah. Were there any trains that departed late?

271
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,178
Yeah, there was one.

272
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:15,378
What time?

273
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:18,778
It was the 1:17 pm train to Aohata.

274
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,378
Why was it delayed?

275
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:24,178
It tried to leave on time,

276
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:27,478
but the gates at the crossing just outside the station wouldn't descend.

277
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,478
When the conductor examined it,

278
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:32,378
he found someone had vandalized the crossing gate.

279
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:36,778
Earlier you said the sign changes automatically

280
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:39,478
when it's time for the previous train to leave.

281
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:41,778
Does that mean the sign changed to 2:02 pm

282
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,978
while the previous train was late?

283
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:46,778
Yeah, that's right.

284
00:17:46,778 --> 00:17:50,678
Could you look up what time the delayed train arrived

285
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,078
in Aohata Station?

286
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:54,678
Let's see.

287
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:56,778
It departed five minutes late,

288
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,278
but it made up some time on the way.

289
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:03,578
The train scheduled to arrive at 1:50 pm arrived at 1:53 pm.

290
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:05,978
So, what?

291
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:09,378
If you arrive in Aohata Station at 1:53 pm,

292
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:13,078
you can get on the 1:55 pm special express.

293
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:14,878
But the question is...

294
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,278
They're the same.

295
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,778
There's no mistaking it.

296
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,078
He made this painting here.

297
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:26,978
But we met Mr. Nishiyama around 11 am.

298
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:33,378
He couldn't have painted this in the less than two hours

299
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,078
between when he started and when he got on the 1:17 pm train.

300
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,078
Huh? What's this?

301
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:41,478
He probably accidentally got some paint on it.

302
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,178
It's yesterday's dog.

303
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:51,278
Mister, this dog was tied to this tree yesterday, right?

304
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:54,578
Yeah. I was fishing down there.

305
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,578
There's good fishing here.

306
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,878
Do you live nearby?

307
00:18:58,878 --> 00:18:59,978
Yeah.

308
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:03,678
Could you take a look at something?

309
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:07,078
Do you know what this is?

310
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:10,178
Yeah, it's barricade tape.

311
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:11,978
Barricade tape?

312
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:15,278
They were worried about a dead tree falling,

313
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:17,878
so a crew from town hall cut it down last week.

314
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,578
Last week?

315
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:23,378
Around what time did you take your dog home yesterday?

316
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,478
I went home to eat lunch, so it was around 12:30 pm.

317
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:30,378
There was someone painting here then, right?

318
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,078
No, I didn't see anyone painting.

319
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:35,778
-What? -He wasn't here?

320
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,278
Really?

321
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,778
Thank you.

322
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:46,078
We solved it, Officer Takagi.

323
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:47,778
Yeah.

324
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:51,678
What? Mr. Nishiyama's alibi fell apart?

325
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:56,678
Yes. This is how Mr. Nishiyama fabricated his alibi.

326
00:19:56,678 --> 00:20:01,478
First, he made that painting last week.

327
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:05,378
But that's not enough to prove an alibi.

328
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,878
That's why he asked us to model yesterday

329
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:12,678
and painted us on top of the scenery he'd already painted.

330
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,878
But there was something there that shouldn't have been,

331
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:20,678
the tree that was cut down last week.

332
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:24,478
Then Mr. Nishiyama returned to the station,

333
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:28,278
vandalized the crossing gate, and delayed the train.

334
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:32,178
He waited for the sign to change and took a photo.

335
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:37,478
But since he actually boarded the 1:17 pm train,

336
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:42,678
he was able to board the 1:55 pm special express at Aohata Station.

337
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:45,678
That train would let him arrive at the studio in time

338
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,778
to commit the murder.

339
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:51,078
We don't know his motive,

340
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:55,078
but if he did all that work beforehand,

341
00:20:55,078 --> 00:21:01,278
then Mr. Daiki Nishiyama definitely killed Mr. Seiho Kitasono.

342
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:07,278
It...

343
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:09,778
It wasn't my fault!

344
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:12,878
It's...

345
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:14,978
It's Mr. Kitasono's fault!

346
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:21,578
He made people pay in exchange for selecting them as winners.

347
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:24,078
I couldn't afford it,

348
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:26,378
so I always lost.

349
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:31,878
Mr. Nishiyama, why did you decide to become a painter?

350
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,578
Because you loved painting?

351
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:36,678
Didn't you become an artist

352
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:40,578
so the children who saw your paintings would smile?

353
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:46,378
But you betrayed the children who modeled for you.

354
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:52,078
You deceived your audience and stooped to using them to commit a murder.

355
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:56,078
You've been betrayed as well

356
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:59,178
by the paintings you used to love.

357
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,578
Genta, no fair.

358
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:31,578
You guys said you just wanted drinks.

359
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,778
You didn't say you wanted any.

360
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:36,978
Officer Takagi, we want ice cream, too.

361
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:39,778
Yeah, we wanted you to know without us telling you.

362
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:42,178
You kids are hopeless.

363
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:50,678
Japan has the most punctual trains in the world.

364
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:53,478
-Ice cream! -Ice cream!

365
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:57,678
"Next Episode" -This is The Metropolitan Police Department!

366
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,778
Iwao Takatori!

367
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:02,878
You're under arrest for robbing a jewelry store!

368
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:04,778
You're a bunch of uncultured fools.

369
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,278
How dare you interrupt my coffee time.

370
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:10,378
There's a checkpoint up ahead.

371
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:11,978
What will you do?

372
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:14,378
You can't just keep going forward.

373
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:24,378
Next Conan, "Conan Kidnapped (Part 1)"

374
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,621
Next Conan's Hint:

375
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:29,321
"Chimney"

376
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:30,321
You again?

377
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,321
You're involved in another case again?

378
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:32,521
No fair, Conan!

379
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,021
It's not easy.
