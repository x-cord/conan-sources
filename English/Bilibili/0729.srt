1
00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:04.224
I won't be able to see you anymore.

2
00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:15.224
Please take care of yourself.

3
00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:33.124
"Fin"

4
00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:34.624
Oh, my...

5
00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.224
It's really touching no matter how many times I watch it.

6
00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:39.624
Thank you for watching.

7
00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:45.324
"Misuzu Shirakawa (58)" -It's an old movie,

8
00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:50.224
"Actress" -but I hope young girls like you enjoyed it too.

9
00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:51.924
Yes, of course!

10
00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:54.024
It was really enjoyable.

11
00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:55.224
Mother,

12
00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:58.224
"Kyosuke Shirakawa (23)" -why not show them the room upstairs too?

13
00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.624
"Misuzu's son" -The odds and ends that she used in the movies

14
00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:01.224
are decorated there.

15
00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:04.024
Oh! I'd sure like to take a look.

16
00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.224
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

17
00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:21.124
are slashed by the light of deduction.

18
00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:22.924
A fire breaks out a movie star's residence.

19
00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:25.124
The surprising truth that is hidden behind the artwork.

20
00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:26.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:28.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:31.124
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:08.712
"A Diamond, Artwork and a Great Actress"

24
00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:13.012
All such nostalgic movies.

25
00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:16.712
This is a mini Misuzu Shirakawa Museum, isn't it?

26
00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:18.312
How embarrassing.

27
00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:20.912
These are things that my late husband has collected.

28
00:03:20.912 --> 00:03:22.512
I see.

29
00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.312
This is the room where the costume that she used to wear

30
00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:26.512
and the odds and ends that had been used are.

31
00:03:30.212 --> 00:03:32.212
It's fantastic.

32
00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:37.312
This is mother's bedroom.

33
00:03:37.312 --> 00:03:41.912
Memorable things and valuables are in this glass case.

34
00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:46.112
Is this genuine?

35
00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:48.712
Of course!

36
00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:51.912
Mrs. Shirakawa would never decorate fake things!

37
00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:54.912
Is that genuine too?

38
00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:00.212
"Chiharu Shirakawa (22), Misuzu's daughter" -It's genuine.

39
00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:04.812
I felt sorry keeping it in the glass case right through.

40
00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:08.912
It's a drawing that was used when I filmed "Holiday at Rokumeikan."

41
00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:11.812
But, there was no necklace in the drawing when it was finished.

42
00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:13.712
So I thought...

43
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:14.812
I see.

44
00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:18.512
Hey, Dad.

45
00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:20.212
Watch out!

46
00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:21.512
I know.

47
00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:28.412
What is he doing?

48
00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:30.412
Hey, Mother!

49
00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:31.912
What's the meaning of this?

50
00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:33.812
What's all the commotion about?

51
00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:36.812
"Saori Shirakawa (21)" -Why did you cancel my passing the audition?

52
00:04:36.812 --> 00:04:39.312
Please calm down, Saori.

53
00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:41.412
I heard about it from the producer.

54
00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:42.812
That you called

55
00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:45.812
and canceled my passing the audition.

56
00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:47.212
Audition?

57
00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:51.012
Saori auditioned for a certain movie.

58
00:04:51.012 --> 00:04:53.812
That's because you're not a good singer

59
00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:55.412
and your acting is not good either.

60
00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:57.812
I'm too ashamed to have you perform in public.

61
00:04:57.812 --> 00:04:59.012
Mother.

62
00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:00.712
Stop deciding things on your own!

63
00:05:00.712 --> 00:05:02.312
Enough!

64
00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:06.412
I'm not going to let you throw dirt on my name!

65
00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:09.412
You were an actress long time ago!

66
00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:13.312
Nobody remembers an actress called Misuzu Shirakawa anymore!

67
00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:14.312
Saori!

68
00:05:14.312 --> 00:05:15.612
Let her be!

69
00:05:17.412 --> 00:05:19.812
Okay, let's have lunch.

70
00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:22.912
Yuka, please show everyone to the terrace.

71
00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:24.212
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:38.112
-Conan, what're you doing? -Okay.

73
00:05:41.912 --> 00:05:43.412
How would you like some jam?

74
00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:45.312
Thank you.

75
00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:47.612
I'm sorry about what just happened.

76
00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:51.312
Mother is strict when it comes to acting.

77
00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:52.612
No.

78
00:05:52.612 --> 00:05:55.912
Mother is living in dreamland.

79
00:05:55.912 --> 00:05:59.312
In a land where she used to be a great actress.

80
00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:02.612
That's not nice, Kyosuke.

81
00:06:05.512 --> 00:06:08.712
I'm sorry about what happened a while ago.

82
00:06:08.712 --> 00:06:11.212
It's so embarrassing.

83
00:06:11.212 --> 00:06:14.312
No, don't worry about it.

84
00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:16.612
Well, no matter how old they get,

85
00:06:16.612 --> 00:06:19.012
children are children, you see.

86
00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:20.012
Like they say,

87
00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:22.612
"No child knows how dear he is to his parents".

88
00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:29.712
Yuka!

89
00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:31.012
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:34.012
"Yuka Nakanishi (22)" -This is not the usual rose jam, is it?

91
00:06:34.012 --> 00:06:37.212
"Maid" -I'm sorry, when I looked yesterday,

92
00:06:37.212 --> 00:06:40.512
I thought I had two more bottles, but...

93
00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:42.412
Go buy some right this minute!

94
00:06:42.412 --> 00:06:45.812
You don't have to get all worked up over a bottle of jam, Mother.

95
00:06:45.812 --> 00:06:50.212
Nobody used to forget my favorite at the film studio.

96
00:06:50.212 --> 00:06:53.112
-That was before, Mother. -What...

97
00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.912
I'm sorry. I'll go pick some up right away.

98
00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:03.812
Kyosuke.

99
00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:06.612
It's a bit early but I'll drink my medicine.

100
00:07:06.612 --> 00:07:08.312
Please get it ready.

101
00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:09.512
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.812
Then, Mr. Mouri, if you will excuse me,

103
00:07:11.812 --> 00:07:13.512
I'll see you later.

104
00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:18.912
I'm sorry for all this.

105
00:07:18.912 --> 00:07:20.212
No, don't be.

106
00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:23.012
That's right, if you will excuse me,

107
00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:25.012
I'll go check on Yuka.

108
00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:26.312
Please do.

109
00:07:33.312 --> 00:07:35.312
What's with this house anyway?

110
00:07:36.312 --> 00:07:39.112
I'm sorry for all the commotion.

111
00:07:39.112 --> 00:07:40.312
Not at all.

112
00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:43.012
Where's Chiharu?

113
00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:45.412
She went to check on Yuka.

114
00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:47.012
I see.

115
00:07:47.012 --> 00:07:50.212
Is Misuzu sick or something?

116
00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:54.812
She's going to take an afternoon nap.

117
00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:57.412
Afternoon nap?

118
00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:59.812
Yes. She takes an afternoon nap between the hours of 02:00 pm

119
00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:00.912
and 04:00 pm every day.

120
00:08:00.912 --> 00:08:02.512
That's her daily routine.

121
00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:04.912
She goes as far as to drink sleeping pills to do so.

122
00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:07.512
She says she does it to maintain her health and beauty.

123
00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:28.912
Yuka, are you all right?

124
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:32.312
What happened?

125
00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.112
I'm to blame.

126
00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:35.712
I wasn't looking straight.

127
00:08:35.712 --> 00:08:38.712
I'm sorry, I got out of sorts...

128
00:08:38.712 --> 00:08:42.012
Oh, no. You really went all out.

129
00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:43.512
I was watching.

130
00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:45.512
Chiharu staggered in front of the road

131
00:08:45.512 --> 00:08:50.412
and Yuka who tried to avoid her landed in the pond.

132
00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:52.912
It's not Yuka's fault.

133
00:08:52.912 --> 00:08:55.112
You people!

134
00:08:55.112 --> 00:08:57.512
What's all the commotion?

135
00:08:57.512 --> 00:08:59.012
Hey, that car?

136
00:08:59.012 --> 00:09:02.512
Please forgive me, I was careless.

137
00:09:02.512 --> 00:09:04.712
No! I...

138
00:09:04.712 --> 00:09:06.112
Never mind!

139
00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:11.112
Yuka, pack your bags and leave as of today!

140
00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:12.612
I don't believe this.

141
00:09:12.612 --> 00:09:15.912
The first thing you'd ask is if the person's okay or not, right?

142
00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:18.712
The car can be fixed with insurance!

143
00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:20.512
Enough is enough!

144
00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:23.312
Why are you always so selfish like that?

145
00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.812
Have you ever thought of the feelings of others at all?

146
00:09:26.812 --> 00:09:30.312
Is that how you should be talking to your parent?

147
00:09:30.312 --> 00:09:33.512
I'm tired. I'm going to rest.

148
00:09:37.012 --> 00:09:39.112
Don't worry, Yuka.

149
00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.112
We'll persuade her later.

150
00:09:42.112 --> 00:09:44.412
Then, Mr. Mouri, please help us.

151
00:09:54.912 --> 00:09:57.412
Mr. Mouri, thank you so much.

152
00:09:57.412 --> 00:10:00.012
No, no need to thank me.

153
00:10:00.012 --> 00:10:02.812
All Dad this was press on the gas.

154
00:10:07.612 --> 00:10:09.512
Doesn't it smell like something is burning?

155
00:10:10.912 --> 00:10:13.912
-Madam's room is... -Mother!

156
00:10:13.912 --> 00:10:15.012
Mother!

157
00:10:16.812 --> 00:10:18.412
Misuzu!

158
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:27.812
-Misuzu! -Mother!

159
00:10:28.812 --> 00:10:30.412
Kyosuke, hold that side.

160
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:31.512
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:33.412 --> 00:10:35.112
This is?

162
00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:42.712
Today at around 02:00 pm,

163
00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:45.412
there was a fire at the residence of actress Misuzu Shirakawa,

164
00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:48.612
and Mrs. Shirakawa passed away.

165
00:10:48.612 --> 00:10:51.112
"Police Detective Tamagawa" -Mr. Mouri, when you entered the room,

166
00:10:51.112 --> 00:10:52.712
was Mrs. Shirakawa already...

167
00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:53.912
Yes.

168
00:10:53.912 --> 00:10:57.012
It seems that she drank some sleeping pills before taking a nap

169
00:10:57.012 --> 00:10:58.812
so I guess she inhaled a lot of smoke

170
00:10:58.812 --> 00:11:01.812
without being aware of the fire.

171
00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:03.112
I see.

172
00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:07.112
But, the fire seems to have ignited from a strange place.

173
00:11:07.112 --> 00:11:08.312
True.

174
00:11:08.312 --> 00:11:10.112
Did your Mother smoke cigarettes?

175
00:11:10.112 --> 00:11:11.212
No.

176
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.512
Not only Mother,

177
00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:15.312
but no one smokes cigarettes in this house.

178
00:11:18.312 --> 00:11:19.512
This is?

179
00:11:21.812 --> 00:11:23.212
Maybe...

180
00:11:26.512 --> 00:11:28.912
I get the picture.

181
00:11:28.912 --> 00:11:31.712
Which means that this is a homicide.

182
00:11:31.712 --> 00:11:33.712
Moreover, the perp is...

183
00:11:39.412 --> 00:11:42.012
The perp is that person!

184
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.021
So...

185
00:11:55.021 --> 00:11:56.821
It's already sundown

186
00:11:56.821 --> 00:12:00.321
and hard to conclude if this is a homicide or an accident,

187
00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:01.421
so we'll return to the station

188
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.921
and wait for the results from forensics...

189
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:05.421
Please wait, Officer Tamagawa!

190
00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:08.721
Any problem?

191
00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:10.721
Well, no...

192
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:13.921
Dad?

193
00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:14.921
Mr. Mouri?

194
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:17.821
Don't tell me that this is the Sleeping Kogoro?

195
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:18.821
What?

196
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.821
Everyone.

197
00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.821
The fire was set off deliberately

198
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:25.821
to kill Mrs Misuzu Shirakawa.

199
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:29.521
Are you saying that this is a homicide?

200
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:30.921
Exactly.

201
00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:33.621
Moreover, the perp is here!

202
00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:40.421
But, Dad, back them all of us were near the pond.

203
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.121
Yeah. It's probably a type of fire

204
00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:45.321
caused because of concentrated sunlight to a specific area.

205
00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:47.021
Fire caused by a concentration of sunlight?

206
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:49.321
Fire caused by a concentration of sunlight is fire

207
00:12:49.321 --> 00:12:51.621
that is set off by things like water from a PET bottle

208
00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:55.021
serving the role of a convex lens.

209
00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:58.221
In other words, Mr. Mouri...

210
00:12:58.221 --> 00:13:01.121
are you saying that the sunlight was concentrated on the surface

211
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:03.221
of that portrait and was ignited?

212
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:05.721
But, this room is located on the north side

213
00:13:05.721 --> 00:13:08.121
and sunlight doesn't come in.

214
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.221
Please look out the window.

215
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:12.621
That glass building which looks

216
00:13:12.621 --> 00:13:15.821
to have been diagonally cut off with a knife.

217
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:19.521
Doesn't it remind you of something when you look at it, Kyosuke?

218
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:23.021
That's right.

219
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:25.821
It's true that when I ran into this room.

220
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.421
But even if the sunlight were to have reflected on that building,

221
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.621
it would only hit the wall on the opposite side...

222
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.921
The mirror.

223
00:13:36.921 --> 00:13:38.121
No.

224
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:40.821
Even if it reflected off this mirror,

225
00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:44.421
I still think the light wouldn't hit the portrait.

226
00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:49.521
It's true that there seems to be some difficulty here.

227
00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:52.121
Then, let's confirm it.

228
00:13:53.721 --> 00:13:55.121
Like this?

229
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.821
A little more upwards.

230
00:13:56.821 --> 00:13:58.121
About here?

231
00:13:58.121 --> 00:13:59.121
Okay.

232
00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:01.121
Please turn on the switch then.

233
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:06.721
Just as I thought...

234
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:10.821
The light has gone to the wall opposite the portrait.

235
00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:14.021
Then, Yuka please replace the mirror that is on the floor

236
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:16.121
to its original position.

237
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.221
Yes, sir.

238
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:21.621
It probably fell during the commotion of extinguishing the fire.

239
00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:24.921
Can you see the mark on the stand?

240
00:14:26.821 --> 00:14:28.121
Yes, here it is!

241
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:30.621
There's one on the glass case too,

242
00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:33.321
so can you match it and line it up?

243
00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:34.321
Yes.

244
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:39.721
Please match the vertical angle too.

245
00:14:39.721 --> 00:14:40.921
Yes, sir.

246
00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:45.521
The light hit the portrait!

247
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:48.221
Please do the same with the other two too.

248
00:14:56.821 --> 00:14:59.821
In other words, this is what it is.

249
00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:02.621
The light that reflected off the glass building,

250
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:03.721
went through the window

251
00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:05.821
and reflected on the full length mirror.

252
00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:08.021
On top of that it also reflected

253
00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:10.221
on the three mirrors on top of the glass case.

254
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:13.421
Then, it concentrated on one point of the portrait.

255
00:15:13.421 --> 00:15:16.621
The perp probably set the position of the mirrors

256
00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:19.021
meticulously in place beforehand.

257
00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:21.621
But, please try remembering.

258
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:24.121
When I was shown here before noon

259
00:15:24.121 --> 00:15:27.321
I mistakenly knocked over the mirror.

260
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:30.721
Which means that it was highly likely that the position of the mirror

261
00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.221
may have been displaced from where the perp had placed it.

262
00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:36.121
Despite this, the fire burst out just as

263
00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:38.521
the perp had planned.

264
00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.621
Which means...

265
00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:43.921
The perp returned the position of the mirrors in the right place?

266
00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:48.421
Yes. Moreover, there's only one person who could've done it.

267
00:15:48.421 --> 00:15:51.721
The person who remained back in this room

268
00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:53.821
when all of us went out to the terrace,

269
00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:55.621
Ms. Chiharu Shirakawa!

270
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:59.521
You're the only one!

271
00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:01.821
No.

272
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:03.621
No way.

273
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:05.221
Is that true, Chiharu?

274
00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:07.621
Did you kill...

275
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:10.321
No! Wait a second.

276
00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:14.221
My Mother opened the window for just two or three minutes.

277
00:16:14.221 --> 00:16:18.221
Can something be ignited in such a short time?

278
00:16:18.221 --> 00:16:20.221
Yes, you can.

279
00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:21.721
Chiharu,

280
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:23.821
after you repositioned the mirrors,

281
00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:28.921
you applied a combustible solution most probably something

282
00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.721
like a thinner that is used when oil painting.

283
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:32.921
A thinner?

284
00:16:32.921 --> 00:16:34.121
Yes.

285
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:37.721
In volatile solvents such as turpentine and petrol,

286
00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:40.521
there are those that have flash points below 50��C.

287
00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:45.921
You're the one who hid the rose jam too, aren't you?

288
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.821
Just as expected,

289
00:16:47.821 --> 00:16:51.021
Misuzu sent Yuka off to buy a new bottle of jam.

290
00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:55.121
Then, you jumped in front of Yuka's car.

291
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:07.421
You people!

292
00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:09.721
What's the commotion about?

293
00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:11.421
Hey, that car?

294
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:14.321
Have you ever thought of the feelings of others at all?

295
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:17.421
Is that how you should be talking to your parent?

296
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:22.221
Is it true? Chiharu?

297
00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:26.021
Is it true, sis?

298
00:17:26.021 --> 00:17:27.821
Did you kill Mother, Chiharu?

299
00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:29.821
Where's the proof?

300
00:17:29.821 --> 00:17:32.121
If you're going as far as to say so, Mr. Mouri,

301
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.521
please show me what proof you have.

302
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:36.521
The proof.

303
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:37.521
Yes.

304
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:41.221
What we've heard till now are all assumptions.

305
00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:43.921
Just because I was the last one to leave the room,

306
00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:47.621
does that serve as proof that I changed the position of the mirror?

307
00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:48.721
Ridiculous.

308
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:50.221
Yuka?

309
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:51.221
Yes?

310
00:17:52.221 --> 00:17:55.221
A lily was decorated in this room, wasn't it?

311
00:17:55.221 --> 00:17:58.621
Yes, because Madam used to like it.

312
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:00.721
How about in the other rooms?

313
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:01.721
No.

314
00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:05.421
This is the only room that a lily was decorated in.

315
00:18:05.421 --> 00:18:09.421
Mr. Mouri, just what are you getting at?

316
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.021
Of course about proof.

317
00:18:13.221 --> 00:18:14.421
In other words,

318
00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:18.121
I'm talking about the pollen of the lily

319
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:20.421
that's attached to the outer part of your right sleeve.

320
00:18:28.521 --> 00:18:31.621
What proof will this serve as?

321
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:35.021
Why would the pollen of the lily that is only decorated in this room

322
00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:38.321
be attached to your right sleeve?

323
00:18:38.321 --> 00:18:42.321
It's probably because I touched the lily accidently at some point, no?

324
00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:45.321
-Just because of that you can't... -Accidentally at what point?

325
00:18:45.321 --> 00:18:47.621
I don't remember!

326
00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:49.821
Please carefully try to remember.

327
00:18:49.821 --> 00:18:55.021
The lily was decorated in the vase on top of the glass case.

328
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:58.521
If the pollen got attached to your right sleeve,

329
00:18:58.521 --> 00:19:02.221
it means that you reached over your right hand,

330
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:05.821
to the left of the lily, and did something.

331
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:08.221
Then what was there?

332
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:10.921
Right.

333
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:15.121
Over there was what was used in the experiment a while ago

334
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:19.521
to reflect and concentrate light, the mirrors!

335
00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:25.221
Chiharu.

336
00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:29.121
Chiharu, why? Why did you kill...

337
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:30.421
Miss Chiharu.

338
00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:35.021
That woman, she kept calling me "Miss Chiharu"

339
00:19:35.021 --> 00:19:37.021
for as long as I can remember.

340
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:41.021
You two were always called "Kyosuke" or "Saori", though.

341
00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:43.021
Just because of something like that...

342
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:48.821
Mr. Mouri, my father brought me into this family.

343
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:50.621
When I heard that my Father was going to get married again

344
00:19:50.621 --> 00:19:54.121
and she was to be his new wife, I was really happy.

345
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:57.721
After all, she was the actress of my dreams.

346
00:19:57.721 --> 00:20:01.221
Therefore, I did anything I could to get her to like me.

347
00:20:01.221 --> 00:20:03.521
I tried not to be selfish,

348
00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:06.721
and did household chores of my own intiative.

349
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:09.521
But, all that came back from that woman was,

350
00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:11.721
"Good work, Miss Chiharu",

351
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.721
"Thank you, Miss Chiharu",

352
00:20:13.721 --> 00:20:15.721
"No, Miss Chiharu".

353
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:18.921
Miss Chiharu, Miss Chiharu, Miss Chiharu...

354
00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:25.521
It was just last week.

355
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:30.921
As for her, she has nothing to do with me.

356
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:32.121
It's okay, don't worry about it.

357
00:20:32.121 --> 00:20:35.121
She's just a child of my husband's ex-wife.

358
00:20:36.521 --> 00:20:37.921
Yes, that's right.

359
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:40.721
The only two children who are blood related with me,

360
00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:43.521
Misuzu Shirakwa are Saori and Kyosuke.

361
00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:48.521
I'm not going to give her a cent of inheritance either!

362
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.221
Miss Chiharu.

363
00:20:57.221 --> 00:21:00.321
This is my personal opinion

364
00:21:00.321 --> 00:21:04.121
but I think you tried too hard.

365
00:21:05.721 --> 00:21:07.021
A parent child relationship

366
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:09.121
isn't something you should over work yourself over.

367
00:21:09.121 --> 00:21:13.821
I think you should've been more selfish and assert yourself.

368
00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:18.421
I guess you started off pushing the wrong button.

369
00:22:51.221 --> 00:22:52.621
"Mouri Detective Agency"

370
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:54.321
Hey, Dad!

371
00:22:55.621 --> 00:22:58.521
You went to the horse races again, didn't you?

372
00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:01.121
Idiot, no way.

373
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:04.521
Geez, and you ate curry there too, didn't you?

374
00:23:04.521 --> 00:23:06.621
What're you going to do about dinner?

375
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:08.521
How'd you know?

376
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:13.321
It's on your shirt the curry stain.

377
00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:17.021
Oh, well...

378
00:23:18.121 --> 00:23:19.921
I admit that I ate curry.

379
00:23:19.921 --> 00:23:24.421
-But, it's not that I ate it at the race track. -Pops.

380
00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:28.121
Your ear, your ear.

381
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:32.321
Oh, my God. Why is this on my ear?

382
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:35.021
It's strange. Mysterious things do happen.

383
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:37.021
What a poor sport!

384
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:38.821
I'm cutting your allowance down 50 per cent!

385
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:46.421
Yikes! Please give me mercy my lady!

386
00:23:46.421 --> 00:23:49.921
You're a detective so you should be observant of trivials.

387
00:23:52.921 --> 00:23:55.821
One stab right through the chest.

388
00:23:55.821 --> 00:24:00.921
Aren't you the one who killed Mr. Kitajima, Mr. Hiroto?

389
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:05.121
It's you two, Mr. Hiroto and Mr. Morishita too,

390
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:08.021
I'll bet you two are the perps.

391
00:24:08.021 --> 00:24:09.121
There's one thing in this room

392
00:24:09.121 --> 00:24:12.321
of the same color that is from nature.

393
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.421
Can you tell what is it, everyone?

394
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:16.221
Over there!

395
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.821
Next Conan,

396
00:24:17.821 --> 00:24:21.721
"A Much Too Perfect Figurine".

397
00:24:37.721 --> 00:24:40.021
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:42.221
"Paint".

399
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:43.821
Going to the horse races again?

400
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:45.021
I'm born in the year of the horse.

401
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:46.621
What a horsey justification.
