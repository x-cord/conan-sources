1
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:04,224
I won't be able to see you anymore.

2
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:15,224
Please take care of yourself.

3
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,124
"Fin"

4
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:34,624
Oh, my...

5
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:37,224
It's really touching no matter how many times I watch it.

6
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,624
Thank you for watching.

7
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:45,324
"Misuzu Shirakawa (58)" -It's an old movie,

8
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:50,224
"Actress" -but I hope young girls like you enjoyed it too.

9
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,924
Yes, of course!

10
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:54,024
It was really enjoyable.

11
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:55,224
Mother,

12
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:58,224
"Kyosuke Shirakawa (23)" -why not show them the room upstairs too?

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,624
"Misuzu's son" -The odds and ends that she used in the movies

14
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:01,224
are decorated there.

15
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:04,024
Oh! I'd sure like to take a look.

16
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:19,224
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

17
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:21,124
are slashed by the light of deduction.

18
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,924
A fire breaks out a movie star's residence.

19
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,124
The surprising truth that is hidden behind the artwork.

20
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:26,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:28,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:31,124
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:08,712
"A Diamond, Artwork and a Great Actress"

24
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,012
All such nostalgic movies.

25
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:16,712
This is a mini Misuzu Shirakawa Museum, isn't it?

26
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,312
How embarrassing.

27
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:20,912
These are things that my late husband has collected.

28
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:22,512
I see.

29
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,312
This is the room where the costume that she used to wear

30
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:26,512
and the odds and ends that had been used are.

31
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,212
It's fantastic.

32
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:37,312
This is mother's bedroom.

33
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:41,912
Memorable things and valuables are in this glass case.

34
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:46,112
Is this genuine?

35
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,712
Of course!

36
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:51,912
Mrs. Shirakawa would never decorate fake things!

37
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,912
Is that genuine too?

38
00:03:58,712 --> 00:04:00,212
"Chiharu Shirakawa (22), Misuzu's daughter" -It's genuine.

39
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:04,812
I felt sorry keeping it in the glass case right through.

40
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:08,912
It's a drawing that was used when I filmed "Holiday at Rokumeikan."

41
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:11,812
But, there was no necklace in the drawing when it was finished.

42
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,712
So I thought...

43
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,812
I see.

44
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:18,512
Hey, Dad.

45
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,212
Watch out!

46
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:21,512
I know.

47
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,412
What is he doing?

48
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,412
Hey, Mother!

49
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:31,912
What's the meaning of this?

50
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,812
What's all the commotion about?

51
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:36,812
"Saori Shirakawa (21)" -Why did you cancel my passing the audition?

52
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:39,312
Please calm down, Saori.

53
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,412
I heard about it from the producer.

54
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:42,812
That you called

55
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:45,812
and canceled my passing the audition.

56
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,212
Audition?

57
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:51,012
Saori auditioned for a certain movie.

58
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,812
That's because you're not a good singer

59
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,412
and your acting is not good either.

60
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:57,812
I'm too ashamed to have you perform in public.

61
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,012
Mother.

62
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,712
Stop deciding things on your own!

63
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:02,312
Enough!

64
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:06,412
I'm not going to let you throw dirt on my name!

65
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:09,412
You were an actress long time ago!

66
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:13,312
Nobody remembers an actress called Misuzu Shirakawa anymore!

67
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,312
Saori!

68
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,612
Let her be!

69
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,812
Okay, let's have lunch.

70
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:22,912
Yuka, please show everyone to the terrace.

71
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,212
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:38,112
-Conan, what're you doing? -Okay.

73
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:43,412
How would you like some jam?

74
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:45,312
Thank you.

75
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,612
I'm sorry about what just happened.

76
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:51,312
Mother is strict when it comes to acting.

77
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,612
No.

78
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:55,912
Mother is living in dreamland.

79
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:59,312
In a land where she used to be a great actress.

80
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:02,612
That's not nice, Kyosuke.

81
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:08,712
I'm sorry about what happened a while ago.

82
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,212
It's so embarrassing.

83
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:14,312
No, don't worry about it.

84
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,612
Well, no matter how old they get,

85
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:19,012
children are children, you see.

86
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,012
Like they say,

87
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,612
"No child knows how dear he is to his parents".

88
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:29,712
Yuka!

89
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,012
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:34,012
"Yuka Nakanishi (22)" -This is not the usual rose jam, is it?

91
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:37,212
"Maid" -I'm sorry, when I looked yesterday,

92
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:40,512
I thought I had two more bottles, but...

93
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,412
Go buy some right this minute!

94
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:45,812
You don't have to get all worked up over a bottle of jam, Mother.

95
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:50,212
Nobody used to forget my favorite at the film studio.

96
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:53,112
-That was before, Mother. -What...

97
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,912
I'm sorry. I'll go pick some up right away.

98
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,812
Kyosuke.

99
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:06,612
It's a bit early but I'll drink my medicine.

100
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:08,312
Please get it ready.

101
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:09,512
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,812
Then, Mr. Mouri, if you will excuse me,

103
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,512
I'll see you later.

104
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:18,912
I'm sorry for all this.

105
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,212
No, don't be.

106
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:23,012
That's right, if you will excuse me,

107
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:25,012
I'll go check on Yuka.

108
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,312
Please do.

109
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,312
What's with this house anyway?

110
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:39,112
I'm sorry for all the commotion.

111
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,312
Not at all.

112
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:43,012
Where's Chiharu?

113
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,412
She went to check on Yuka.

114
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,012
I see.

115
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:50,212
Is Misuzu sick or something?

116
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,812
She's going to take an afternoon nap.

117
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,412
Afternoon nap?

118
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:59,812
Yes. She takes an afternoon nap between the hours of 02:00 pm

119
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,912
and 04:00 pm every day.

120
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,512
That's her daily routine.

121
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:04,912
She goes as far as to drink sleeping pills to do so.

122
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:07,512
She says she does it to maintain her health and beauty.

123
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,912
Yuka, are you all right?

124
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,312
What happened?

125
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,112
I'm to blame.

126
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:35,712
I wasn't looking straight.

127
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:38,712
I'm sorry, I got out of sorts...

128
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,012
Oh, no. You really went all out.

129
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:43,512
I was watching.

130
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,512
Chiharu staggered in front of the road

131
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:50,412
and Yuka who tried to avoid her landed in the pond.

132
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,912
It's not Yuka's fault.

133
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:55,112
You people!

134
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:57,512
What's all the commotion?

135
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:59,012
Hey, that car?

136
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:02,512
Please forgive me, I was careless.

137
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:04,712
No! I...

138
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,112
Never mind!

139
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:11,112
Yuka, pack your bags and leave as of today!

140
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:12,612
I don't believe this.

141
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,912
The first thing you'd ask is if the person's okay or not, right?

142
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,712
The car can be fixed with insurance!

143
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:20,512
Enough is enough!

144
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,312
Why are you always so selfish like that?

145
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,812
Have you ever thought of the feelings of others at all?

146
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:30,312
Is that how you should be talking to your parent?

147
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:33,512
I'm tired. I'm going to rest.

148
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:39,112
Don't worry, Yuka.

149
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,112
We'll persuade her later.

150
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,412
Then, Mr. Mouri, please help us.

151
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:57,412
Mr. Mouri, thank you so much.

152
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,012
No, no need to thank me.

153
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:02,812
All Dad this was press on the gas.

154
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,512
Doesn't it smell like something is burning?

155
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,912
-Madam's room is... -Mother!

156
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,012
Mother!

157
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:18,412
Misuzu!

158
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,812
-Misuzu! -Mother!

159
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:30,412
Kyosuke, hold that side.

160
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:31,512
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:35,112
This is?

162
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:42,712
Today at around 02:00 pm,

163
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:45,412
there was a fire at the residence of actress Misuzu Shirakawa,

164
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,612
and Mrs. Shirakawa passed away.

165
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:51,112
"Police Detective Tamagawa" -Mr. Mouri, when you entered the room,

166
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,712
was Mrs. Shirakawa already...

167
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:53,912
Yes.

168
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:57,012
It seems that she drank some sleeping pills before taking a nap

169
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,812
so I guess she inhaled a lot of smoke

170
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:01,812
without being aware of the fire.

171
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:03,112
I see.

172
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:07,112
But, the fire seems to have ignited from a strange place.

173
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:08,312
True.

174
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,112
Did your Mother smoke cigarettes?

175
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:11,212
No.

176
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,512
Not only Mother,

177
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:15,312
but no one smokes cigarettes in this house.

178
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,512
This is?

179
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,212
Maybe...

180
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,912
I get the picture.

181
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:31,712
Which means that this is a homicide.

182
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,712
Moreover, the perp is...

183
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,012
The perp is that person!

184
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,021
So...

185
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,821
It's already sundown

186
00:11:56,821 --> 00:12:00,321
and hard to conclude if this is a homicide or an accident,

187
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,421
so we'll return to the station

188
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,921
and wait for the results from forensics...

189
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,421
Please wait, Officer Tamagawa!

190
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:08,721
Any problem?

191
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,721
Well, no...

192
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,921
Dad?

193
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:14,921
Mr. Mouri?

194
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,821
Don't tell me that this is the Sleeping Kogoro?

195
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,821
What?

196
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,821
Everyone.

197
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:23,821
The fire was set off deliberately

198
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:25,821
to kill Mrs Misuzu Shirakawa.

199
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,521
Are you saying that this is a homicide?

200
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:30,921
Exactly.

201
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,621
Moreover, the perp is here!

202
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:40,421
But, Dad, back them all of us were near the pond.

203
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,121
Yeah. It's probably a type of fire

204
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:45,321
caused because of concentrated sunlight to a specific area.

205
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:47,021
Fire caused by a concentration of sunlight?

206
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,321
Fire caused by a concentration of sunlight is fire

207
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:51,621
that is set off by things like water from a PET bottle

208
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:55,021
serving the role of a convex lens.

209
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,221
In other words, Mr. Mouri...

210
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:01,121
are you saying that the sunlight was concentrated on the surface

211
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:03,221
of that portrait and was ignited?

212
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,721
But, this room is located on the north side

213
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,121
and sunlight doesn't come in.

214
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,221
Please look out the window.

215
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,621
That glass building which looks

216
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:15,821
to have been diagonally cut off with a knife.

217
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,521
Doesn't it remind you of something when you look at it, Kyosuke?

218
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,021
That's right.

219
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,821
It's true that when I ran into this room.

220
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:31,421
But even if the sunlight were to have reflected on that building,

221
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,621
it would only hit the wall on the opposite side...

222
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,921
The mirror.

223
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:38,121
No.

224
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,821
Even if it reflected off this mirror,

225
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,421
I still think the light wouldn't hit the portrait.

226
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,521
It's true that there seems to be some difficulty here.

227
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,121
Then, let's confirm it.

228
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,121
Like this?

229
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,821
A little more upwards.

230
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:58,121
About here?

231
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,121
Okay.

232
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,121
Please turn on the switch then.

233
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:06,721
Just as I thought...

234
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,821
The light has gone to the wall opposite the portrait.

235
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:14,021
Then, Yuka please replace the mirror that is on the floor

236
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,121
to its original position.

237
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,221
Yes, sir.

238
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:21,621
It probably fell during the commotion of extinguishing the fire.

239
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:24,921
Can you see the mark on the stand?

240
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,121
Yes, here it is!

241
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,621
There's one on the glass case too,

242
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,321
so can you match it and line it up?

243
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,321
Yes.

244
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,721
Please match the vertical angle too.

245
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:40,921
Yes, sir.

246
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,521
The light hit the portrait!

247
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:48,221
Please do the same with the other two too.

248
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,821
In other words, this is what it is.

249
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:02,621
The light that reflected off the glass building,

250
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:03,721
went through the window

251
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,821
and reflected on the full length mirror.

252
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,021
On top of that it also reflected

253
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,221
on the three mirrors on top of the glass case.

254
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:13,421
Then, it concentrated on one point of the portrait.

255
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:16,621
The perp probably set the position of the mirrors

256
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,021
meticulously in place beforehand.

257
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:21,621
But, please try remembering.

258
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,121
When I was shown here before noon

259
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:27,321
I mistakenly knocked over the mirror.

260
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:30,721
Which means that it was highly likely that the position of the mirror

261
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,221
may have been displaced from where the perp had placed it.

262
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:36,121
Despite this, the fire burst out just as

263
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:38,521
the perp had planned.

264
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,621
Which means...

265
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:43,921
The perp returned the position of the mirrors in the right place?

266
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:48,421
Yes. Moreover, there's only one person who could've done it.

267
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:51,721
The person who remained back in this room

268
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,821
when all of us went out to the terrace,

269
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,621
Ms. Chiharu Shirakawa!

270
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,521
You're the only one!

271
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:01,821
No.

272
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,621
No way.

273
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,221
Is that true, Chiharu?

274
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:07,621
Did you kill...

275
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:10,321
No! Wait a second.

276
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:14,221
My Mother opened the window for just two or three minutes.

277
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:18,221
Can something be ignited in such a short time?

278
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,221
Yes, you can.

279
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,721
Chiharu,

280
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,821
after you repositioned the mirrors,

281
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:28,921
you applied a combustible solution most probably something

282
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,721
like a thinner that is used when oil painting.

283
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:32,921
A thinner?

284
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,121
Yes.

285
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:37,721
In volatile solvents such as turpentine and petrol,

286
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:40,521
there are those that have flash points below 50��C.

287
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,921
You're the one who hid the rose jam too, aren't you?

288
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,821
Just as expected,

289
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:51,021
Misuzu sent Yuka off to buy a new bottle of jam.

290
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:55,121
Then, you jumped in front of Yuka's car.

291
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,421
You people!

292
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,721
What's the commotion about?

293
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:11,421
Hey, that car?

294
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,321
Have you ever thought of the feelings of others at all?

295
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:17,421
Is that how you should be talking to your parent?

296
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,221
Is it true? Chiharu?

297
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:26,021
Is it true, sis?

298
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,821
Did you kill Mother, Chiharu?

299
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:29,821
Where's the proof?

300
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:32,121
If you're going as far as to say so, Mr. Mouri,

301
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,521
please show me what proof you have.

302
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,521
The proof.

303
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,521
Yes.

304
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,221
What we've heard till now are all assumptions.

305
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:43,921
Just because I was the last one to leave the room,

306
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,621
does that serve as proof that I changed the position of the mirror?

307
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:48,721
Ridiculous.

308
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,221
Yuka?

309
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:51,221
Yes?

310
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:55,221
A lily was decorated in this room, wasn't it?

311
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,621
Yes, because Madam used to like it.

312
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:00,721
How about in the other rooms?

313
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,721
No.

314
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:05,421
This is the only room that a lily was decorated in.

315
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:09,421
Mr. Mouri, just what are you getting at?

316
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,021
Of course about proof.

317
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,421
In other words,

318
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:18,121
I'm talking about the pollen of the lily

319
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,421
that's attached to the outer part of your right sleeve.

320
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,621
What proof will this serve as?

321
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:35,021
Why would the pollen of the lily that is only decorated in this room

322
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:38,321
be attached to your right sleeve?

323
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:42,321
It's probably because I touched the lily accidently at some point, no?

324
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,321
-Just because of that you can't... -Accidentally at what point?

325
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:47,621
I don't remember!

326
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:49,821
Please carefully try to remember.

327
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:55,021
The lily was decorated in the vase on top of the glass case.

328
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:58,521
If the pollen got attached to your right sleeve,

329
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:02,221
it means that you reached over your right hand,

330
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:05,821
to the left of the lily, and did something.

331
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:08,221
Then what was there?

332
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:10,921
Right.

333
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,121
Over there was what was used in the experiment a while ago

334
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,521
to reflect and concentrate light, the mirrors!

335
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,221
Chiharu.

336
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:29,121
Chiharu, why? Why did you kill...

337
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,421
Miss Chiharu.

338
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:35,021
That woman, she kept calling me "Miss Chiharu"

339
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,021
for as long as I can remember.

340
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:41,021
You two were always called "Kyosuke" or "Saori", though.

341
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:43,021
Just because of something like that...

342
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:48,821
Mr. Mouri, my father brought me into this family.

343
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,621
When I heard that my Father was going to get married again

344
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:54,121
and she was to be his new wife, I was really happy.

345
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,721
After all, she was the actress of my dreams.

346
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:01,221
Therefore, I did anything I could to get her to like me.

347
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,521
I tried not to be selfish,

348
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:06,721
and did household chores of my own intiative.

349
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:09,521
But, all that came back from that woman was,

350
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,721
"Good work, Miss Chiharu",

351
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,721
"Thank you, Miss Chiharu",

352
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,721
"No, Miss Chiharu".

353
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:18,921
Miss Chiharu, Miss Chiharu, Miss Chiharu...

354
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,521
It was just last week.

355
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:30,921
As for her, she has nothing to do with me.

356
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,121
It's okay, don't worry about it.

357
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,121
She's just a child of my husband's ex-wife.

358
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,921
Yes, that's right.

359
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,721
The only two children who are blood related with me,

360
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:43,521
Misuzu Shirakwa are Saori and Kyosuke.

361
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:48,521
I'm not going to give her a cent of inheritance either!

362
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,221
Miss Chiharu.

363
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:00,321
This is my personal opinion

364
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:04,121
but I think you tried too hard.

365
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,021
A parent child relationship

366
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,121
isn't something you should over work yourself over.

367
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:13,821
I think you should've been more selfish and assert yourself.

368
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:18,421
I guess you started off pushing the wrong button.

369
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,621
"Mouri Detective Agency"

370
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,321
Hey, Dad!

371
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:58,521
You went to the horse races again, didn't you?

372
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,121
Idiot, no way.

373
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:04,521
Geez, and you ate curry there too, didn't you?

374
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:06,621
What're you going to do about dinner?

375
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,521
How'd you know?

376
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,321
It's on your shirt the curry stain.

377
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:17,021
Oh, well...

378
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:19,921
I admit that I ate curry.

379
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:24,421
-But, it's not that I ate it at the race track. -Pops.

380
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:28,121
Your ear, your ear.

381
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:32,321
Oh, my God. Why is this on my ear?

382
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,021
It's strange. Mysterious things do happen.

383
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:37,021
What a poor sport!

384
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:38,821
I'm cutting your allowance down 50 per cent!

385
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:46,421
Yikes! Please give me mercy my lady!

386
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:49,921
You're a detective so you should be observant of trivials.

387
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:55,821
One stab right through the chest.

388
00:23:55,821 --> 00:24:00,921
Aren't you the one who killed Mr. Kitajima, Mr. Hiroto?

389
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:05,121
It's you two, Mr. Hiroto and Mr. Morishita too,

390
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:08,021
I'll bet you two are the perps.

391
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:09,121
There's one thing in this room

392
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:12,321
of the same color that is from nature.

393
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,421
Can you tell what is it, everyone?

394
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,221
Over there!

395
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,821
Next Conan,

396
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:21,721
"A Much Too Perfect Figurine".

397
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,021
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,221
"Paint".

399
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:43,821
Going to the horse races again?

400
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:45,021
I'm born in the year of the horse.

401
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:46,621
What a horsey justification.
