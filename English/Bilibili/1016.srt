1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,440
Hey!

2
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,310
What happened? Are you all right?

3
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,020
It hurts... It hurts...

4
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,520
Am I going to die?

5
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,860
You'll be fine, as long as
we can stop the bleeding.

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
What's this?

7
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,070
Excuse me, could I borrow your scarf?

8
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,290
Sure.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,920
Mister, should we press
the emergency stop button?

10
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,820
Yeah.

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,680
What's the matter? Did something happen?

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,820
Someone's injured.

13
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,090
A passenger has been wounded.

14
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,300
Call the police and an ambulance.

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,170
Hurry it up! Now!

16
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,450
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,260
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

18
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,590
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,540
Bullets fly into a moving train!

20
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,300
Track down the sniper who disappeared!

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,430
Always determining the one truth

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,180
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,020
his name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,400
The Monorail Sniper Case
(Part One)

25
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,580
The Monorail Sniper Case
(Part One)
"The Monorail Sniper Case, Part One!"

26
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,000
The Monorail Sniper Case
(Part One)

27
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,200
Is everyone all right?
Where's the injured person?

28
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,140
We're fine. We stopped the
bleeding. He's sitting inside.

29
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,660
Mister, let's find the culprit quickly.

30
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,770
You don't have to tell me twice.

31
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,040
Whoops. Preserving the crime
scene is our top priority.

32
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,460
Don't touch anything until
the police arrive. Got it?

33
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,610
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,450
Where did the shot come from?
Which way is the wind blowing?

35
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,070
This way!

36
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,830
Hey, wait!

37
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,090
Hello? There's been a shooting
near the end of the monorail line.

38
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,090
If you close the roads immediately, we can
trap the culprit on the artificial island.

39
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,600
Yes, do it. I'll track down the culprit.

40
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,730
Inspector Megure, you heard him.
What should we do?

41
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,450
Instruct the monorail
company to stop service.

42
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,230
Contact the Wangan Police Station
and have them set up checkpoints

43
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,110
at all Wangan-Toto Station exits.

44
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,660
Toto Artificial Island

45
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,940
Toto Artificial Island
We'll also set up checkpoints on all nine
bridges surrounding the artificial island.

46
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,800
Toto Artificial Island
We'll seal off the entire
island and trap the culprit.

47
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,620
Toto Artificial Island
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,250
The moment the shot was fired, the monorail
was around that spot on the rail.

49
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,450
The bullet entered through the
second window from the front

50
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,560
and struck the victim's arm.

51
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,960
If we can determine the angle
of the hole in the window,

52
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,750
Direction of Travel

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,250
Shooting Victim

54
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,960
Shooting Victim
the location of the shooting victim,

55
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,500
Shooter's Location

56
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,590
Shooter's Location
and the monorail's location at that time,

57
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,970
Shooter's Location

58
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,960
then we can calculate where
the shot was fired from.

59
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,950
The shooter's location was probably...

60
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
It's that building.

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,220
But...

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,870
How do you know that?

63
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,370
What? Uh, my daily horoscope said
my guesses would be right today.

64
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,130
I see. Your horoscope, huh?

65
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,540
Yeah, right!

66
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,800
Who would believe that nonsense?

67
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,140
Hey, look! I saw someone who
might be the culprit over there!

68
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,990
What? Really?

69
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,440
All right, kid! Follow me!

70
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,320
Wait, Mister!

71
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,580
Excuse me, it's an emergency.

72
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,120
Could you open the door?

73
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,250
Judging by the height of the monorail
car, the shot was probably fired from...

74
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,370
Mister, the fifth floor. The second
window from the end was open.

75
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,980
What? Really?

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,320
Yeah, I was watching from
inside the monorail.

77
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,220
It's unlocked.

78
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,510
There's no one here.

79
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,810
They fled.

80
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,770
This place is empty.

81
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,870
There's no sign of the shooter.

82
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,130
Maybe you made a mistake when
you thought you saw the culprit.

83
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,630
That wasn't a mistake, it was a lie.

84
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,990
There's no mistaking it.

85
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,300
The shot was definitely fired from here.

86
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,060
Looks like a man lives alone here.

87
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,800
Mister, could you thoroughly
search this apartment?

88
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,710
I'm going to look around outside.

89
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,620
H-Hey, wait.

90
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,910
We're already unlawfully entering.

91
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,870
Hey!

92
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,820
Hello, this is Takagi.

93
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
What is it?

94
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,970
We've arrived at the monorail.

95
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,700
Forensics is currently
examining the crime scene.

96
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,580
Also, as you suggested, we've
blocked off all the roads.

97
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Also, as you suggested, we've
blocked off all the roads.
Checkpoint

98
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,590
Have you figured out anything else?

99
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,590
Yes, it's about the victim.

100
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,930
His name is Maruta Daisuke-san, 28 years old.

101
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,250
His name is Maruta Daisuke-san, 28 years old.
Maruta Daisuke (28)

102
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,390
Maruta Daisuke (28)
He works for a construction company.

103
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,890
He works for a construction company.

104
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,600
He was shot in the upper left arm,
and he's in no danger of dying.

105
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,860
The bullet has been extracted,
and he's currently resting.

106
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,960
He apparently doesn't know
anyone who owns a gun,

107
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,860
nor has he done anything to
incur someone's ill will.

108
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,200
But that's all according to him.

109
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,640
We'll continue with our investigation.

110
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,730
Got it.

111
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,870
I'll contact you right away
if I find the culprit.

112
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
They're faint,

113
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,020
but there are scuff marks left by something
heavy that was dragged down the hallway.

114
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,080
Huh? Conan-kun? Whatâ€”

115
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,620
It's me. Takagi.

116
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,720
Mori-san, why are you calling
from Conan-kun's phone?

117
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,650
Did you find the culprit?

118
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,720
No, not yet.

119
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,300
Then is there something
you forgot to mention?

120
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,890
I suppose, yes.

121
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,660
Seriously? He must've been talking
to the old man until a moment ago.

122
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,670
Anyway, there's a location I'd like
forensics to examine immediately.

123
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm counting on you.

124
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,020
What are you doing here?

125
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,470
Nothing.

126
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,980
Let's go. Standing around here
is just a waste of our time.

127
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,610
Let's see...

128
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,440
Mister.

129
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,240
What is it?

130
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,580
What do you think this is?

131
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,750
Bloodstains.

132
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,000
They lead that way.

133
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
That's it.

134
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,200
In other words, the culprit
is over there. Let's go.

135
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,260
Okay.

136
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,490
Hey, wait!

137
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
What's the problem?

138
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,760
Hey, Conan. We're pursuing a shooter, right?

139
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,310
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,110
Do the bloodstains have anything
to do with the shooter?

141
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,060
Oh, right...

142
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,620
Checkpoint

143
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,630
Please Stop!

144
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,450
It's Takagi.

145
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,880
Hello?

146
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,190
Mori-san, you were right.

147
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,760
Impressive as always, Detective.

148
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,640
I was right? About what?

149
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,140
Oh, please.

150
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,890
I'm talking about room 505.

151
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,150
As you suspected, we found gunshot residue.

152
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,810
What?

153
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,280
Then the shot was fired from that room?

154
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,280
Yes, but that's not all.

155
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,160
We also observed a luminol
reaction on the floor.

156
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,290
What?

157
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,410
The bloodstains were apparently wiped
away after splattering on the floor.

158
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,800
Judging by the volume,
the victim was probably...

159
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,050
The scuff marks in the hallway.

160
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,320
The scrap of plastic sheet.

161
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,550
The bullet that was fired, and
the bloodstains in the room.

162
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,020
Does that mean your shot
in the dark was right?

163
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,390
It's just a coincidence.

164
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,540
Coincidence?

165
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,310
Yeah, a coincidence.

166
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,070
But I wonder if it was a coincidence that
there were bloodstains in that room.

167
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,660
Coincidence?

168
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,090
Shot in the dark?

169
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,940
The bullet!

170
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,580
Takagi, have you figured out anything
from the bullet that was fired?

171
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,090
Yes, forensics examined the bullet extracted
from the victim's upper left arm.

172
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,280
It's a 30-caliber 7.62 millimeter full
metal jacket Mauser military bullet,

173
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,600
also known as a Tokarev bullet.

174
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,730
You can snipe someone with a
Tokarev from that distance?

175
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm not sure,

176
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,480
but it's hard to imagine the culprit
used a handgun to snipe the victim.

177
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,740
Which means the victim was coincidentally
struck by a stray bullet?

178
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,240
Yes, it does seem that way.

179
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,040
Based on current evidence, the
culprit shot someone in room 505,

180
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,000
and the bullet passed through them.

181
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,320
That bullet flew outside the room,

182
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,810
pierced the monorail window,
and struck the victim's arm.

183
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,270
Is that even possible?

184
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,770
There's a hundred meters between
the window and the monorail line.

185
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,030
It passed through a person's body, pierced
a monorail window, and struck someone's arm.

186
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,780
It's possible.

187
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,030
Tokarevs are designed to
have excellent penetration.

188
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,780
It was a handgun and not a rifle?

189
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,080
Handguns and rifles have
different trajectories,

190
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,540
but striking the first victim must have
applied an angle to the bullet's path.

191
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,790
But that would mean...

192
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,830
It's impossible to do intentionally, but
with the right series of coincidences...

193
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,300
It's not impossible.

194
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,630
In other words, that's the truth.

195
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,300
Hey, Mister.

196
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,310
We found the connection between
the culprit and the bloodstains.

197
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,070
Found it.

198
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,920
Over here, Mister.

199
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,160
We can follow these bloodstains all we want,

200
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,450
but won't the culprit escape
while we're wasting time here?

201
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,710
What's this smell?

202
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,110
Mister, there's a woman tied up in there.

203
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,620
This smell...

204
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,890
Mister, it's gasoline!

205
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,620
Damn it. The door is locked.

206
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,920
We'll have to break the window.

207
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,830
Hurry!

208
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Run, mister!

209
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,610
Mori-san!

210
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,840
Detective Takagi.

211
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,790
Are you hurt?

212
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,910
We're fine.

213
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,920
Did that woman say anything?

214
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,130
Yeah.

215
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,030
Yeah.
Tamura Kiyomi (32)

216
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,340
Tamura Kiyomi (32)
She was rather frightened and distraught,

217
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,420
She was rather frightened and distraught,

218
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,420
but she said while walking around this area,

219
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,070
something was suddenly
placed against her mouth,

220
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,240
and she lost consciousness.

221
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,060
When she woke up after the attack,

222
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,250
she'd been abandoned inside the car.

223
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,710
Does she know who may have
wanted to kidnap her?

224
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,820
She has no idea who it could've been.

225
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,740
Detective Takagi, we've confirmed the
victim's background and questioned her.

226
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,520
We didn't find anything in her background or
testimony that would lead us to the culprit.

227
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,390
I see. Thank you.

228
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,520
Yes, sir. Excuse me.

229
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,590
No clues, huh?

230
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,490
Anyway, the culprit must have rather
violent tendencies to set fire to a car.

231
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,800
They've probably been watching
us tracking them down.

232
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,480
They did this to disrupt the investigation.

233
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,230
So, have there been any
developments with the apartment?

234
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,810
As you suspected, they seem to
have wrapped the victim in a sheet

235
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,230
and are transporting them somewhere.

236
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,110
Detective Takagi, why is the culprit
taking the victim away from the apartment?

237
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,660
Well...

238
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,830
They're obviously trying
to hide the evidence.

239
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:55,030
Don't you think carrying the victim
around with them is too risky?

240
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,090
I suppose.

241
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,090
Perhaps there's a reason
they have to take that risk.

242
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,260
If you were the culprit, what would you do?

243
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,430
What?

244
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,900
Well, normally you'd want to get rid
of the victim as soon as possible.

245
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,620
But you're still carrying them with you.

246
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,770
Where would you take them?

247
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't know.

248
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,230
If you carried something as large
as a body through a normal place,

249
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,270
you'd draw attention to yourself.

250
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,820
Where would it seem natural to
carry something large around here?

251
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,950
That's it. That place would work.

252
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,380
That's right.

253
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,690
There's only one place
on this artificial island

254
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,740
where it wouldn't seem unnatural
to carry something large.

255
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,200
It matches the direction indicated
by the trail of blood, too.

256
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,900
Toto Market, Tokyo.

257
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,120
You certainly wouldn't
stand out at Toto Market

258
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,270
by carrying something large and heavy,

259
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,270
like a tuna or amberjack.

260
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,270
But what is the culprit trying
to accomplish by doing that?

261
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,280
Isn't determining that and
catching the culprit our job?

262
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,550
Toto Market

263
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,080
The culprit should be somewhere in here.
