1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,824
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,624
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:06,224
The abduction case is more than what it seems.

4
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:08,224
But as we look into the mysteries, their motive becomes clear.

5
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:09,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:13,724
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:47,479
We went to participate in a tennis tournament at Kunamoto.

9
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,979
After finding a cell phone that someone had dropped,

10
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,279
Ran and Sanoko went to deliver it back to the owner.

11
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,579
But there, Ran unable to defend herself...

12
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,279
and was kidnapped by someone.

13
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,779
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 2)"

14
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,579
We've kidnapped a high school girl called Ran Mouri.

15
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,079
If you want her back safely, get 50 million yen ready.

16
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,179
Take that money

17
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,179
and get on the Amakusa Pearl Line Cruiser departing at 3:00 pm.

18
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:32,179
We'll contact you again from there.

19
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:36,479
Darn.

20
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,879
Fifty million yen is totally impossible.

21
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,079
Moreover, it's only 2 hours till 3:00 pm.

22
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,779
Mr. Mouri.

23
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,879
Mr. Mouri, about that...

24
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,979
After hearing your name, a local big shot has offered to help.

25
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,879
I want to thank you for that.

26
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,579
Then, let me take the money.

27
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,279
No, that's not...

28
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,479
Please. Let me take it.

29
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,379
I can't just sit here and do nothing, I can't take it.

30
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,779
All right.

31
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:12,079
But, you've got to give me your word that you won't do anything rash,

32
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,479
and that you'll follow our orders.

33
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,679
Okay. I owe you one.

34
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,879
"Kumamoto Prefectural Police Department"

35
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,379
You don't seem to like the idea.

36
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,679
Ai.

37
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:39,079
You're thinking that it's not just a plain kidnapping case, right?

38
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,579
Right.

39
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,579
Why'd the kidnapper call the police department directly?

40
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,979
It's strange because normally no criminal

41
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,279
would want to get in touch with the police

42
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,279
if at all possible.

43
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,579
Besides, there's two hours to go

44
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,679
before the money is to be handed over.

45
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,879
It's as if they're giving the police to get their men together.

46
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,979
Right.

47
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,379
And, there's one more thing...

48
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,579
The last words Ran mentioned over the phone.

49
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,979
They were saying that they're going to kill somebody today...

50
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,979
Which means...

51
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,679
That the kidnapping is just a sham,

52
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,979
and there's a possibility that they kidnapped Ran

53
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,679
so that their murder plan wouldn't be revealed.

54
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,679
Which means that even if the ransom is paid,

55
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,079
that won't guarantee that they'll let her go.

56
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,779
Yeah.

57
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,079
However, although it would've been really simple

58
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,979
to shut Ran up on the spot,

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,479
they went out of their way to kidnap her.

60
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,579
So, they just may let her free.

61
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,179
I guess so.

62
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:43,679
First priority is to figure out where Ran is being confined.

63
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:45,779
Once that's done, everything will co me to light.

64
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,779
Right.

65
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,479
Bad news.

66
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,379
Conan is nowhere in sight.

67
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,179
-What? -Come to think of it, neither is Ai.

68
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,979
Ai too?

69
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:02,679
Really, and the semi-finals is going to be starting soon.

70
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,379
Maybe...

71
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,279
Maybe they both went to look for Ran.

72
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:13,379
No good, there're no clues to the kidnappers left.

73
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,479
Nobody seems to have heard of a place called Hirukomachi either.

74
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,879
Darn.

75
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,279
I searched the internet and hit several sites, though?

76
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,279
But they are all far and most likely not what we're looking for.

77
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,879
Yeah. It took them an hour to call after kidnapping Ran.

78
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,879
If they're traveling by car,

79
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,979
they are within a radius of 40 km.

80
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,079
If there is no place call Hirukomachi within that distance,

81
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,479
she probably read it wrong, or it's somebody's name.

82
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,479
Will you look for the name of a town that is within this distance?

83
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,979
I'll go check out all the names in the phone book.

84
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,979
Hiru, Hiru...

85
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,279
Hey. You guys.

86
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,979
We looked all over for you.

87
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,879
Hey, what about the match, you guys?

88
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,679
How rude. We're worried about Ran too.

89
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,079
Don't take us lightly.

90
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,579
Sonoko was crying at the hotel too.

91
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,579
That's it.

92
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,579
Ran, Ran...

93
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,579
Answer the phone. Please.

94
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,579
Come on, you're a detective's daughter, aren't you?

95
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,979
Ran?

96
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,679
It's you, Conan.

97
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:29,879
Sonoko, about that cell phone that you picked up...

98
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,179
Is there anything else you noticed about it besides the mail?

99
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,279
Come to think of it...

100
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,479
Just before we reached the coffee shop were supposed to meet,

101
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,179
a mail came in.

102
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,679
Come on, why didn't you mention that earlier?

103
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,979
What was it about?

104
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,579
Well... It was kind of strange.

105
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,979
Sonoko, if you can't make it today,

106
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,379
please go offer incense by yourself on the memorial day of his death.

107
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,979
And don't forget to take the sunflower

108
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,579
that is growing behind the factory in Yokomachi.

109
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,979
That's what the content said.

110
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,279
On the other side of the sunflowers,

111
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,279
there is a sign.

112
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,979
It's Yokomachi.

113
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,379
Yokomachi, Yokomachi...

114
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,779
Here it is. It's written "Hirunoko"

115
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,479
but read Yokomachi Clinic.

116
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,079
I found it.

117
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,479
Conan, what's up?

118
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,479
Hey, are you listening?

119
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,379
Hey, how dare you hang up like that on me?

120
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,679
Come to think of it...

121
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:36,179
"The sunflower..." -The sunflowers that Ran saw...

122
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,979
Oh no.

123
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,679
"Cruise ship docks"

124
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,879
"Cruise ship docks and sourvenir shop"

125
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,879
"Cruise ship ticket booth"

126
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,079
Hold on a just a while longer, Ran.

127
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,579
"Akira Doi (25), Factory Worker"

128
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,779
Now, the semi-finals are finally about to begin.

129
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,779
Who is going to win the first match?

130
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,379
Will it be Masato Tachikawa?

131
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,179
Or will it be the new star of hope, Kyohei Umabuchi?

132
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:12,079
Both contestants are exchanging a firm hand shake now.

133
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,679
Masato Tachikawa is his usually composed self.

134
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:18,179
On the contrary, his opponent, Kyohei Umabuchi is full of fighting spirit.

135
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,279
As would be most fitting for the first match,

136
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,179
the finals start off with both contestants who belong to this locale.

137
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,379
Don't move.

138
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,279
"Hideki Mamiya (25), Factory Worker" -You'd better stay still or,

139
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,379
you see this.

140
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,779
"Yokomachi"

141
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,479
Thanks for the lift.

142
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,279
Yeah, take care.

143
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,679
There it is, the sunflower field.

144
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,279
Okay. Here goes the Youth Detective Squad.

145
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,079
Win. You've got to win.

146
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,979
The Youth Detective Squad is here.

147
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,379
Are you all right, Ran?

148
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,379
Thank you, Conan.

149
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,579
I'm glad.

150
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,179
It's good to know you're okay.

151
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,579
Sorry to keep you waiting.

152
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,479
Thank you everybody.

153
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,879
Right. We've got big trouble.

154
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,979
These men were saying,

155
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:32,079
"Today's the only chance to kill that guy."

156
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,379
We've got to get the police right away.

157
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,379
Today's the only chance?

158
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,779
What?

159
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,779
Hideki, how could you? You let her get you?

160
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,379
Darn.

161
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,479
It's hurt.

162
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,179
Get a taste of your own medicine.

163
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,279
Okay. Leave the rest to us.

164
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
Stay still.

165
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,679
Case closed.

166
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,579
Yes.

167
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,879
What? Really?

168
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,879
All right, we'll be right there.

169
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,479
Mr. Mouri.

170
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,279
You don't have to board the cruiser anymore.

171
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:27,179
What's taking the police so long?

172
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:29,179
You're right.

173
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:32,679
By the way, who were you guys thinking of killing?

174
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:37,179
If you don't want to tell me, I'll tell you.

175
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,879
If today's the only chance you have to kill him,

176
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,379
it must be somebody who is involved in today's tournament.

177
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,479
You were watching the TV broadcast too, besides.

178
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,079
When I checked out this map, I didn't notice anything but,

179
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,679
the person who gave us a lift was saying...

180
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,879
that this iron factory is the possession of Kenzo Narimasu,

181
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,779
the host of the tennis tournament.

182
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:06,879
I'll bet you were asked to kill somebody by Mr. Narimasu, right?

183
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,279
Why should we team up with a guy like that?

184
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,679
Stupid. Don't talk.

185
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,179
Which means you were planning to kill Mr. Narimasu after all, right?

186
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,379
What's the matter?

187
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,979
The place that they hit me when they kidnapped me

188
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,179
is starting to hurt.

189
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,979
Hey, are you all right?

190
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,279
Conan, there's another criminal. The one who hit me.

191
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,479
What?

192
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,079
You mean the one they call Sonoko?

193
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,079
No, I think it was a man.

194
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,579
When I passed out, I heard the voice of another man.

195
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:46,179
Maybe that man is still...

196
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,379
He is after Mr. Narimasu's life.

197
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,430
What?

198
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,430
Cancel the tennis match and protect Mr. Narimasu?

199
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,830
Yes, because besides the men who are here,

200
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,430
there is one more of them,

201
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,130
and that man is after Mr. Narimasu's life.

202
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,730
Wait a minute.

203
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,730
So, what you're saying is this was not a kidnap for ransom?

204
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,330
No. But, there's no time now to go into detail.

205
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,830
You've got to hurry or Mr. Narimasu's life is in danger.

206
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,130
Okay. You're going to have to give me the details later, though.

207
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,430
Officer Tamana.

208
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,830
Okay, I'll see to it that they do so immediately.

209
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,230
You have got to be kidding.

210
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,630
"Kenzo Narimasu (60)" -My political life rests on this tournament.

211
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,430
"Congressman" -I'm not going to let the police interfere this tournament

212
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,930
just for their own convenience.

213
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,030
But, your life is being endangered...

214
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,330
Shut up.

215
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,230
That's why I hire them and pay them a lot of money to protect me.

216
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,030
I'm not canceling the tournament.

217
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,030
We're continuing the match as is.

218
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,130
Strange, they're not canceling the match.

219
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,730
I wonder what's going on?

220
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,130
Hey, Conan.

221
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,830
Mr. Narimasu.

222
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,530
What a match.

223
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,330
Do you have any comments as host of this tournament?

224
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,830
Well, I guess this is above all riches and fame,

225
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,530
I couldn't ask for more as a host.

226
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,530
It seems that my life is being sought after,

227
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,030
however I, Narimasu will not be intimidated by such threats.

228
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,030
What?

229
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,730
I am firmly determined to throw my life out

230
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,630
for the local citizens of Kumamoto.

231
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,930
No.

232
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,130
So, who will be going to the award stand

233
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,530
to receive the honorable championship trophy

234
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,430
from the chairman of this tournament Kenzo Narimasu?

235
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,330
Will it be Masato Tachikawa?

236
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,430
Or will it be Kyohei Umabuchi?

237
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,530
What shall we do, Conan?

238
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,130
Too bad. Your efforts have gone down the drain.

239
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,330
I'll tell you something good.

240
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,630
That guy, Narimasu doesn't give a darn about people coming after his life,

241
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,130
because he's spending a lot of money to keep himself protected.

242
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,130
Right.

243
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,030
If they're only after his life,

244
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,630
it doesn't have to be today.

245
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,630
Because even today, he is in fact, being protected by his bodyguards.

246
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,230
But, according to Ran, they were saying

247
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,830
that today's the only chance they have of carrying out the murder.

248
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,630
Why? Why is it today?

249
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,630
Sonoko.

250
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,430
Maybe the one called Sonoko can stop them?

251
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,330
Because wasn't Sonoko against this idea?

252
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,330
Didn't you two actually want Sonoko to stop you

253
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,530
from going through with this?

254
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,930
Isn't that why you sent her that mail?

255
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,330
Shut up. We're avenging his death.

256
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,630
Besides, Sonoko's the one who was most maltreated

257
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,230
by Narimasu among all of us.

258
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,230
That's why this is also for Sonoko's sake too.

259
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,830
But, wasn't already trying to forget everything already?

260
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,630
Maybe that's why she was against this plan?

261
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,530
Hey.

262
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,230
Isn't he Mr. Narimasu's secretary,

263
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,630
Mr. Saiki, who committed suicide the other day?

264
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,930
So, that's the story after all.

265
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,430
Today is Mr. Saiki's memorial day, isn't it?

266
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,930
You all used to visit his grave together, right?

267
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,830
I think Sonoko is waiting for you at the grave.

268
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,430
I'm sure she's waiting for you both to come.

269
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,130
She believes that you'll drop this plan

270
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,030
and come to his grave,

271
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,730
where she's waiting.

272
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,530
It's too late.

273
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,630
Maybe Sonoko could've stopped this plan.

274
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,030
But, no more, not from now.

275
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,430
Hey, Hideki.

276
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,730
The match has already gone this far.

277
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,130
You idiot.

278
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,130
What?

279
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,430
That's it folks, this is the last game,

280
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,930
whether you like it or not.

281
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,530
Tachikawa serves the ball.

282
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,230
I see. I got it.

283
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,730
Now I know why it's got to be carried out today.

284
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,330
So, who will be the one going up to the award stand

285
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,730
to receive the honorable championship trophy

286
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,030
from the chairman of this tournament Kenzo Narimasu?

287
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,830
The bodyguards are going to be some distance away

288
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,930
for just an instant during this match.

289
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,830
But, which of them is it?

290
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,430
Which of them is the killer?

291
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,630
They're both from this locale.

292
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,530
They're ages are more or less the same.

293
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,830
Which of them is it?

294
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,730
Which of them on earth is it?

295
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,930
Darn.

296
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,430
What is it?

297
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,730
This is...

298
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,430
I found him.

299
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,430
The killer is him.

300
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,030
It's a chopper.

301
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,130
I'm sure it's the police.

302
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,330
Ran!

303
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,130
Hey, Ran!

304
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,230
Are you okay, Ran?

305
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,030
I'm fine. I'm okay.

306
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,730
I'm sorry, Ran!

307
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,430
I'll bet you were scared.

308
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,730
Sonoko!

309
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,030
I can understand why you want to kill Mr. Narimasu,

310
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,130
but I'm still not convinced.

311
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,530
A brat like you would never understand how we feel.

312
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,530
Yeah, I don't even want to know how it feels.

313
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,030
Who cares about how somebody feels

314
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,130
about wanting to kill somebody else?

315
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,330
Darn, who the heck are you anyway?

316
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,130
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

317
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,130
Officer. Please head for the tennis tournament grounds immediately.

318
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,530
I've figured out who the other criminal is.

319
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,930
What?

320
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,830
We've got to hurry, or we won't make it in time.

321
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,030
We will now award the winner with the championship trophy.

322
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,130
Winner, Mr. Masato Tachikawa.

323
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,230
You have achieved outstanding performance

324
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:22,030
at the memorable First Land of Fire Cup Charity Tennis Tournament

325
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,030
and will be awarded the Championship Cup.

326
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,230
Mr. Tachikawa, please step up to the award stand.

327
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,530
Congratulations.

328
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,330
It's been a long time, Mr. Narimasu.

329
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,130
I wonder where I have seen you before?

330
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,630
I'm Tachikawa, who was working under Mr. Saiki

331
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,930
at your factory 10 years ago.

332
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,930
10 years ago under Saiki...

333
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,730
Don't tell me that you're...

334
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,630
So, you finally remember.

335
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,830
I'm Masato Tachikawa, who was slave driven at your factory

336
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,630
without being paid decently either.

337
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,830
Don't move.

338
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,630
I was worried when I heard that Mr. Saiki became your secretary

339
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,630
when you became a congressman.

340
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,030
I'll bet you pushed all your wrongdoings onto Mr. Saiki

341
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,330
and killed him, right?

342
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,530
No. Saiki committed suicide.

343
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,530
You made him commit suicide, didn't you?

344
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,430
Darn, how dare you kill such a good person...

345
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,430
10 years ago, when we fled from your factory,

346
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,730
Mr. Saiki's the one who stopped us from taking revenge on you.

347
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,730
But, we should've killed you back then.

348
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,430
If we did, Mr. Saiki wouldn't have had to die.

349
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,930
Don't... please don't.

350
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,430
Go to the world beyond and apologize to Mr. Saiki!

351
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,930
Masato Tachikawa.

352
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,130
Throw down your weapon and let the hostage go.

353
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,330
Shut up, if you come any closer...

354
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,030
Masato, please don't.

355
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,530
It's me, Sonoko.

356
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,330
Sonoko.

357
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,430
Let's stop all this already, Masato.

358
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,830
Today's Mr. Saiki's memorial day.

359
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,930
He'll be lonely if we don't go visit his grave all together.

360
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,330
Okay? Let's all go together, please.

361
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,630
Sonoko.

362
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,530
No. Please.

363
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,430
The tennis that Mr. Saiki approved of,

364
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,330
your tennis is going to get all messed up.

365
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,130
Mr. Saiki was really happy when you became a pro tennis player, remember?

366
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,530
Please don't do anything to make him sad.

367
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,530
Masato.

368
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,730
"Congressman Narimasu Arrested"

369
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,830
Three days later,

370
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,630
congressman Narimasu was arrested on charges of bribery.

371
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,630
It also said in the papers that further investigation

372
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,130
will be conducted as to the truth

373
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,930
behind his secretary Saiki's suicide.

374
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,030
"Congressman Narimasu's True Intentions"

375
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,530
All seems to have ended well.

376
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,830
However, Ai and I have to take responsibility

377
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,230
for losing our chance to win the finals...

378
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,530
No, the semi-finals, that is.

379
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,230
Oh boy.

380
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,330
Conan, shape up.

381
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,630
Break a leg!

382
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,630
You've got three more laps to go.

383
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,130
I'll keep you company.

384
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,130
I guess I'll go take a run too.

385
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,130
Hey.

386
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,330
Good morning, Ai.

387
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,330
Shall we go run too?

388
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,830
Wait for me.

389
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,630
Let's go.

390
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,230
Oh, brother.

391
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,830
"Next Episode"

392
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,430
Amazing.

393
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,130
It's so pretty.

394
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,130
Tamaya!

395
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,930
Mr. Kawai?

396
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,230
Mr. Kawai, please get a hold of yourself!

397
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,430
Mr. Kawai!

398
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,330
This is...

399
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,830
Next Conan,

400
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,830
