1
00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:06.147
Punish the suspicious.

2
00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:09.247
No offense.

3
00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:13.647
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

4
00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:27.247
This can't be happening.

5
00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:41.947
Even gathering the detectives

6
00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.647
did not result in a solution after all.

7
00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:50.147
Cut off? The picture of the hidden camera.

8
00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:52.647
What?

9
00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:56.247
Somebody is inputting data?

10
00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:58.047
Who on earth could it be?

11
00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:05.547
What?

12
00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:08.647
The code of the room has been deciphered.

13
00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:10.647
I'd like to verbally say it directly to you,

14
00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:12.747
so come to the dining room.

15
00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:14.847
The 7th detective!

16
00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:16.847
It can't be!

17
00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.647
It can't be!

18
00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:24.047
All the detectives that I invited should all be dead!

19
00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:26.347
There is no such thing as a 7th detective!

20
00:01:27.147 --> 00:01:30.047
Then, who can it be? Who on earth...

21
00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:38.947
It is difficult to think that

22
00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:42.047
the person who set a bomb to the car ride the car

23
00:01:42.047 --> 00:01:44.047
unless it was a suicidal plan.

24
00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:45.747
However, there are exceptions.

25
00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:50.747
That is, in the case you want to make it look like you,

26
00:01:50.747 --> 00:01:52.447
yourself died in the explosion.

27
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.747
Right?

28
00:01:57.047 --> 00:01:58.847
Detective Senma.

29
00:02:00.947 --> 00:02:03.947
Yes. Before the explosion,

30
00:02:03.947 --> 00:02:06.047
you snuck out of the car,

31
00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:09.347
hid in the bushes, and confirmed the car falling over.

32
00:02:09.347 --> 00:02:12.147
After sneaking back here,

33
00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:15.747
you were watching all of us from a room somewhere in here

34
00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:18.947
through all the hidden cameras.

35
00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:20.047
Don't be ridiculous.

36
00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:21.647
I got out of the car in the nick of time

37
00:02:21.647 --> 00:02:24.847
after I realized the car was going to explode.

38
00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:28.447
I just got back here.

39
00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:30.347
Besides, didn't we decide at that time

40
00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:34.647
who was going to ride the car by tossing coins?

41
00:02:34.647 --> 00:02:35.947
Not really. It was already decided that

42
00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.847
you were going to ride the car even before the coins were tossed.

43
00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:41.447
You set the coin with the head facing up on the back of your hand

44
00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:43.847
even before you tossed the coin.

45
00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:46.247
You covered your right hand over your left hand

46
00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:48.647
from above the coin that you were holding,

47
00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.947
and pretended to catch the coin that you flicked.

48
00:02:50.947 --> 00:02:52.547
You dropped that coin on the ground,

49
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.147
and show the first coin you put on the back of your hand.

50
00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:57.847
No matter how many times you repeat it, you get heads!

51
00:02:57.847 --> 00:02:59.947
Since you had a 10 yen coin on you,

52
00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:03.647
when checking the tea that Mr. Ogami was drinking,

53
00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:05.847
so it would've been able to carry this out, wouldn't you?

54
00:03:05.847 --> 00:03:08.847
"The God Forsaken Child"!

55
00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:11.847
Oh. Are you saying that the host who carried out the supper

56
00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:14.847
and killed Mr. Ogami is me?

57
00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:16.647
Then, tell me.

58
00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:21.547
How did I make only Mr. Ogami take the cyanide in this dining room,

59
00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:26.447
and just how I was able to predict the time?

60
00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:29.347
There was no poison in his tea,

61
00:03:29.347 --> 00:03:33.447
Mr. Mouri was sitting in between Mr. Ogami and me.

62
00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.647
Besides, didn't we play stone, paper, scissors

63
00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:38.547
to decide where to sit?

64
00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:41.047
The seating has nothing to do with it.

65
00:03:41.047 --> 00:03:43.047
Because you had swabbed

66
00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:47.047
everybody's cup with cyanide beforehand anyway.

67
00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:49.047
You swabbed the cyanide in the upper part

68
00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:51.547
where the handle joins the cup.

69
00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:54.447
That is the place where Mr. Ogami's right thumb tip touches

70
00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:57.147
when he holds his tea cup.

71
00:03:57.147 --> 00:03:58.947
It is also very close to his nails

72
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.647
that he unconsciously bites when he thinks.

73
00:04:01.647 --> 00:04:03.147
He started biting his nails

74
00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:05.347
right after the tape recording of you changed voice

75
00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:09.047
announced the code to the hiding place of the treasure.

76
00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:10.347
If you gave instructions to the maid

77
00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:13.647
to serve the tea a little before the tape was to be played.

78
00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:17.247
Mr. Ogami, after hearing about the code, would start thinking

79
00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:20.447
and you would be able to kill him alone just as scheduled.

80
00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:24.747
But, back then, I remember that everyone wiped their dishes

81
00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:27.747
before using them, just to be safe.

82
00:04:27.747 --> 00:04:29.247
True.

83
00:04:29.247 --> 00:04:34.347
It was too careless for a renowned detective, such as Mr. Ogami.

84
00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:39.247
Unless, he was your partner all along.

85
00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:41.747
Being so sure that nothing could ever happen to him,

86
00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:44.347
he skipped the safety precautions that everyone else took.

87
00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:48.347
From the time I heard that when Aki arrived early in the morning,

88
00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:53.647
the Bentz was already parked, I was suspicious of you.

89
00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:55.547
In order for anyone to abandon a Bentz

90
00:04:55.547 --> 00:04:57.547
in such an remote mountain area,

91
00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.047
there had to be someone to ride the Bentz,

92
00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:02.547
as well as, somebody else to come pick you up.

93
00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:05.047
You would need an accomplice.

94
00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:08.547
While I'm at it, the reason why you went out of your way

95
00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:11.347
to wait for Mr. Mouri, and make him give you a lift

96
00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:13.847
was to leave an impression on him, that you don't like cigarettes.

97
00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:14.847
In order to work it out

98
00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:17.847
so that only Mr. Ogami dies in the dining room.

99
00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:19.747
If Mr. Ogami were to put a cigarette in his mouth

100
00:05:19.747 --> 00:05:22.547
after grabbing a cyanide coated cigarette with his fingertips...

101
00:05:23.447 --> 00:05:25.247
He would immediately go to the world beyond.

102
00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:27.647
The reason why you chose Aki to be your maid is because

103
00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:29.747
you found out that she has a habit of biting her fingernails

104
00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:32.447
by watching her through the hidden camera during the interview,

105
00:05:32.447 --> 00:05:33.947
and you figured that you could kill her using the same method

106
00:05:33.947 --> 00:05:36.247
that you used to kill Mr. Ogami at any time.

107
00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:39.947
Yes, you killed Mr. Ogami who was your accomplice,

108
00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:43.347
made yourself look as if you'd been killed by someone,

109
00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:44.747
psychologically cornered all the detectives

110
00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:48.947
that you've invited here into deciphering the code,

111
00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:50.847
and once you found the treasure,

112
00:05:50.847 --> 00:05:53.047
you were going to massacre everyone here.

113
00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:58.047
Just like Renya Karasuma did 40 years ago!

114
00:05:58.047 --> 00:06:01.147
I found the name "Kyosuke Senma" at the end of the words

115
00:06:01.147 --> 00:06:03.647
written in blood on the piano.

116
00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:05.247
That was probably...

117
00:06:05.247 --> 00:06:07.947
That's my father's name.

118
00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:11.747
My father who was an archaeologist

119
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:15.047
was invited to this Twilight Inn 40 years ago.

120
00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:17.347
The story was that a millionaire who was over 100 years of age,

121
00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:19.247
inherited estate from his mother

122
00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:22.747
and found out that there was hidden treasure in the building.

123
00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:26.247
He wanted someone to find the treasure for him

124
00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:29.547
before his time to die.

125
00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:32.047
It seemed to be an easy job that paid well,

126
00:06:32.047 --> 00:06:35.847
and cash was sent to us everyday with a letter,

127
00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:38.447
so my mother and I were delighted.

128
00:06:38.447 --> 00:06:41.547
But, 6 months later, the letters and cash suddenly stopped coming,

129
00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:43.547
and my father who did not tell us where he was going

130
00:06:43.547 --> 00:06:45.747
could not be contacted since then.

131
00:06:45.747 --> 00:06:48.047
We found out the truth,

132
00:06:48.047 --> 00:06:51.347
only after we raised the last letter we got

133
00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:54.347
from my father up to the light.

134
00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:58.047
It was a letter that my father had written by opening holes

135
00:06:58.047 --> 00:07:00.547
using a needle.

136
00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:03.047
The letter was about a code that indicated the location

137
00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:04.547
of the hidden treasure,

138
00:07:04.547 --> 00:07:05.847
that there were many other scientists

139
00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:08.147
other than my father who had been summoned to the place.

140
00:07:08.147 --> 00:07:12.047
And that Karasuma, who was almost at the end of his time,

141
00:07:12.047 --> 00:07:14.447
became impatient and started killing the scientists

142
00:07:14.447 --> 00:07:15.947
as an example of what would happen

143
00:07:15.947 --> 00:07:18.847
if they didn't hurry and find the treasure.

144
00:07:19.747 --> 00:07:21.447
My father had also written that even if the treasure were to be found,

145
00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:24.247
he would not be able to make it out alive.

146
00:07:24.247 --> 00:07:26.347
Did you tell the police about this?

147
00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:28.847
No. I only found out about the letter

148
00:07:28.847 --> 00:07:32.447
written with a needle 20 years later.

149
00:07:32.447 --> 00:07:35.047
And, besides, Renya had already passed away,

150
00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:37.847
and the building was handed over to someone else.

151
00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:40.447
But, it all started when I happened

152
00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:44.347
to talk about this to Ogami 2 years ago.

153
00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:47.547
He went all out and found this place

154
00:07:47.547 --> 00:07:51.247
and started like mad to look for the treasure.

155
00:07:51.247 --> 00:07:54.347
However, he couldn't decipher the code.

156
00:07:54.347 --> 00:07:57.747
He bought this place and had a large debt because of it.

157
00:07:57.747 --> 00:07:59.947
So, unable to reverse what had already been done,

158
00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:02.247
he said the following.

159
00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:03.747
Let's gather all the well-known detectives here

160
00:08:03.747 --> 00:08:04.947
and have them decipher the code!

161
00:08:04.947 --> 00:08:08.347
The bait to get all the detectives to come, is the Thief Kid!

162
00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:10.747
We'll set him up as the host, and set up a game

163
00:08:10.747 --> 00:08:13.247
in which everyone would have to stake their lives on!

164
00:08:13.247 --> 00:08:14.747
By making it look as though both you and me

165
00:08:14.747 --> 00:08:17.447
have been killed part way through the game.

166
00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:22.747
Right! Maybe we should actually kill the maid?

167
00:08:22.747 --> 00:08:25.147
Once they find out that they really have to be risking their lives,

168
00:08:25.147 --> 00:08:27.547
they have no choice but to get serious!

169
00:08:27.547 --> 00:08:31.747
No problem, we'll just put all the blame on the Thief Kid.

170
00:08:31.747 --> 00:08:34.647
Which means the one who chose that maid was...

171
00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.347
Mr. Ogami.

172
00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:38.747
He was delighted saying that he found a maid

173
00:08:38.747 --> 00:08:41.747
with a habit just like his, that he could kill.

174
00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:46.847
I guess he never thought that he'd be killed in the same way.

175
00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:50.247
Yes, he bit his nails at that time,

176
00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:53.947
because I had recorded something he had not expected to hear.

177
00:08:53.947 --> 00:08:59.147
Because he was thinking of killing the maid after the dinner.

178
00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:01.347
But, why did you kill Mr. Ogami?

179
00:09:01.347 --> 00:09:03.247
Because I realized that

180
00:09:03.247 --> 00:09:05.147
he had found the location of the hidden treasure,

181
00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:08.947
and was planning to kill everyone, including me.

182
00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:11.447
By making it look like we all killed each other using the gun

183
00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:14.147
that he had set up in all of our rooms.

184
00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:17.347
If I were to stop Ogami, who was obsessed by Karasuma,

185
00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:20.847
as well as let the detectives continue to decipher the code.

186
00:09:20.847 --> 00:09:23.547
I had no other choice but to carry things out the way I did.

187
00:09:23.547 --> 00:09:26.047
The result ended up the same as 40 years ago.

188
00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:30.547
The code could not be deciphered, and the tragedy was repeated.

189
00:09:30.547 --> 00:09:35.047
I think your father did decipher the code, don't you?

190
00:09:35.047 --> 00:09:36.347
Huh?

191
00:09:36.347 --> 00:09:37.847
Don't you think it's strange that

192
00:09:37.847 --> 00:09:39.747
there is only one clock in this large building,

193
00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:42.447
the one in the dining room. Why?

194
00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.447
Yes. The sentence at the top of the code,

195
00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:47.847
"When the two travelers looked up at the sky" means

196
00:09:47.847 --> 00:09:49.147
when the long hand and the short hand of the clock

197
00:09:49.147 --> 00:09:51.747
point to the same direction at the top, 00:00!

198
00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:55.847
So, let's do that by making the hands of the clock point at 00:00.

199
00:09:55.847 --> 00:09:58.547
And the key to solving the rest of the code

200
00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:00.647
is what your father had left behind by writing in blood,

201
00:10:00.647 --> 00:10:01.747
"the final ace"!

202
00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:04.847
This refers to playing cards in English.

203
00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:08.147
The King, Queen and Jack in the code,

204
00:10:08.147 --> 00:10:11.647
are the King, Queen and Jack of the playing cards.

205
00:10:11.647 --> 00:10:15.447
The treasure is diamond, the chalice is heart

206
00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:18.347
and the dagger is spade.

207
00:10:18.347 --> 00:10:19.347
In other words,

208
00:10:19.347 --> 00:10:21.847
the treasure and the King is the king of diamonds.

209
00:10:21.847 --> 00:10:24.547
The chalice and the Queen is the queen of hearts.

210
00:10:24.547 --> 00:10:28.747
The dagger and the warrior is the jack of spades.

211
00:10:28.747 --> 00:10:31.547
Then you move the hands of the clock

212
00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:36.047
in accordance to the direction their faces are turned.

213
00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:37.947
Left 13.

214
00:10:37.947 --> 00:10:40.147
Left 12.

215
00:10:40.147 --> 00:10:42.847
Right 11, then.

216
00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:53.747
The polish has rubbed off,

217
00:10:53.747 --> 00:10:56.047
and gold is in view on the inside.

218
00:10:56.047 --> 00:10:58.647
Moreover, this clock is heavier than it looks.

219
00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:02.347
I see. The inside of this clock is pure gold.

220
00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:04.247
Well, well...

221
00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:08.447
to think that my father had to die for something like that.

222
00:11:08.447 --> 00:11:11.847
I guess that's life.

223
00:11:11.847 --> 00:11:14.247
So, you promised, Ms. Senma.

224
00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:17.347
Tell me the way out of this place!

225
00:11:17.347 --> 00:11:20.047
There is no way out of here to begin with.

226
00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:23.547
I was planning to bury my bones here.

227
00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:26.547
Although Mr. Ogami did believe me

228
00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:30.147
when I told him that I would tell him the way after dinner.

229
00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:32.347
Just as I thought.

230
00:11:32.347 --> 00:11:33.947
Granny Senma.

231
00:11:33.947 --> 00:11:36.847
What're you going to do about the only valuable I had on me?

232
00:11:36.847 --> 00:11:38.447
Remember, I told you

233
00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:41.047
that something childish like this isn't worth it.

234
00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:44.747
Oh? Complain to sonny over there if you got any gripes.

235
00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:46.947
He's the one who said that she may tell us the way out,

236
00:11:46.947 --> 00:11:50.647
if a child asked to know.

237
00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:52.647
You mean you all pretended to be dead,

238
00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:55.047
just so that I would tell you the way out?

239
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:57.547
Yeah. Because you were even trying to kill

240
00:11:57.547 --> 00:11:59.547
the ones who figured the code out.

241
00:11:59.547 --> 00:12:02.147
We figured that you wouldn't tell us even if we cornered you,

242
00:12:02.147 --> 00:12:04.447
so long as we were alive.

243
00:12:04.447 --> 00:12:09.347
Besides, through the monitor, even ketchup looks like blood.

244
00:12:09.347 --> 00:12:10.947
But, at least...

245
00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:14.047
we did right in putting Ran and Aki to sleep.

246
00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:15.747
This act of bad taste

247
00:12:15.747 --> 00:12:18.747
would have been too harsh on the hearts of young women.

248
00:12:20.447 --> 00:12:22.947
Since when did you know I was the killer?

249
00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:27.047
From the time, that boy over there made I toss the coin.

250
00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:28.247
Back then,

251
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.047
you stretched your hand all the way over to take the coin

252
00:12:30.047 --> 00:12:31.747
that was farthest away from you, right?

253
00:12:31.747 --> 00:12:33.847
That's when it flashed through me.

254
00:12:33.847 --> 00:12:37.447
That you didn't want anyone else to take the 10 yen coin.

255
00:12:37.447 --> 00:12:40.747
If anyone with cyanide on their hands touch the 10 yen coin,

256
00:12:40.747 --> 00:12:42.447
redox reaction would occur,

257
00:12:42.447 --> 00:12:44.547
and the whole trick would be disclosed!

258
00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:47.747
That's why we all took you to be the killer,

259
00:12:47.747 --> 00:12:49.947
and joined hands right off the bat.

260
00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:53.347
I had seen through the trick as soon as I saw

261
00:12:53.347 --> 00:12:55.647
Mr. Ogami's nail of his right thumb.

262
00:12:55.647 --> 00:12:57.247
You little brat.

263
00:12:57.847 --> 00:13:01.847
So, the problem is how do we make it out of here?

264
00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.747
My, what's that sound?

265
00:13:03.747 --> 00:13:06.847
Oh, probably the police choppers that I contacted.

266
00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:08.247
You called them?

267
00:13:08.247 --> 00:13:11.047
Watson probably took the letter that I had attached to his anklet

268
00:13:11.047 --> 00:13:13.347
to nanny who was waiting in the car below the cliff,

269
00:13:13.347 --> 00:13:15.847
as soon as morning came!

270
00:13:15.847 --> 00:13:18.147
I'm glad that I marked the car with an X

271
00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:20.347
so that he'd be able to tell it apart from other cars.

272
00:13:20.347 --> 00:13:22.647
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

273
00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:24.747
Talk about having to put on such a crumby act.

274
00:13:24.747 --> 00:13:27.747
No, that's not only the sound of choppers.

275
00:13:27.747 --> 00:13:31.147
I hear the sound of something collapsing too.

276
00:13:31.147 --> 00:13:32.647
Don't tell me that...

277
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.610
So, the Thief Kid never showed up, huh?

278
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.410
Did you want him to?

279
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.610
Oh, not really.

280
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.210
But, granny.

281
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.410
The thing about psychologically cornering us

282
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.910
was Ogami's idea, wasn't it?

283
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.610
Why did you pretend to be dead after you killed him?

284
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.010
I wanted the code that my father left behind

285
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.110
to be deciphered no matter what the risk.

286
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.410
I wanted to find out in this life time.

287
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.010
I didn't think I could ever have such renowned detectives like you

288
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.810
gather together like this, ever again.

289
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:14.810
Maybe it was I, who was obsessed by Renya Karasuma.

290
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.310
Granny?

291
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.610
What the...

292
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.810
Shoots!

293
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.810
Dad!

294
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.510
Thief Kid?

295
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.610
Hey, granny!

296
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.010
I think you're already too old to rush to your death, huh?

297
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.710
Don't be ridiculous!

298
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.510
I saved you.

299
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.010
As an apology for using your name to hold the supper.

300
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.610
You would've never been able to escape

301
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.910
the grasp of those two boys unless I did it this way.

302
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.510
Especially from the little one that was aiming

303
00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.710
a strange looking watch at you.

304
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.910
Oh, so you knew.

305
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.910
Cigarette. Kogoro Mouri is a heavy smoker.

306
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.710
You didn't smoke one cigarette since arriving at the inn, right?

307
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.010
Who are they, anyway?

308
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:15.710
Lovers that I most definitely do not want to encounter, I guess?

309
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.710
How unfortunate.

310
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.210
You came because you were after Karasuma's treasure, didn't you?

311
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.710
Yeah, at first maybe, but I guess not, after all.

312
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.810
It won't fit into the cloth I carry my stolen goods in.

313
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.210
The walls have collapsed and gold is showing from inside.

314
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.110
That clock was the switch to bring the walls down.

315
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.610
Just a would be expected of a residence owned by Karasuma.

316
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.710
It's worth at least zillions.

317
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.110
I see.

318
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.210
Twilight means the time when the sky glitters yellow at sunset.

319
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.310
It is indeed the Twilight Inn.

320
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.710
Where is my real dad?

321
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.710
Huh?

322
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.310
Over here.
