1
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.820
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.640
It's now 2022, and thanks to all of you,

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.200
the Detective Conan anime
has started its 27th year.

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.140
The previous year and the year
before that were tough,

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.210
but we hope we'll be able to
exit that long tunnel soon.

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880
Take care of your health.

7
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.760
We appreciate your continued support for
the anime, movies, and Shonen Sunday.

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.010
And so...

9
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.940
Happy New Year!

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.460
It comes to visit after falling asleep!

11
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.650
Fall in love with logical deduction and
the pleasure of solving mysteries!

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.480
Taiko Meijin is suspected of cheating?

13
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.150
A shogi board is found at the crime scene!

14
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.590
Always determining the one truth

15
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.350
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

16
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.780
his name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.610
Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board
(Opening Move)

18
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.270
Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board
(Opening Move)
"Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board, Opening Move!"

19
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.010
Taiko Meijin's Shogi Board
(Opening Move)

20
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.270
Oh, right.

21
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.500
What is it, Mitsuhiko?

22
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.900
What are you looking at?

23
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.580
Oh, you know.

24
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.850
Ah! It says online that Japan
won today's afternoon match.

25
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.840
Seriously?

26
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.300
All right!

27
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.880
Come to think of it, there was a game today.

28
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.700
This is unusual behavior for
a soccer fanatic like you.

29
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.220
There's something here
about Higo, Haibara-san.

30
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.170
Really?

31
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.870
Look. It says Double H played
a huge role on Samurai Blue.

32
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.180
Wow!

33
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.240
That's so cool!

34
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.060
Hey, what's Double H?

35
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.110
What?

36
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.770
Wh-What?

37
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.170
You don't know?

38
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.070
Seriously?

39
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.320
Sorry, I guess.

40
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.740
Double H refers to...

41
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.710
Hide

42
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.990
Hide
Tokyo Spirits' Hide and Big Osaka's Higo.

43
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.600
Hide
Tokyo Spirits' Hide and Big Osaka's Higo.
Higo

44
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.370
Hide
Higo
Lately people have been
calling them Double H.

45
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.250
Lately people have been
calling them Double H.
Double H

46
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.750
Oh, really?

47
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.110
So there are things you don't
know after all, Edogawa-kun.

48
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.750
Everyone knows that.

49
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.180
Come to think of it, Haibara-san is an H, too.

50
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.210
You're right.

51
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.760
I don't have time for that right now.

52
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.730
I need to look into Taiko
Meijin's family, the Hanedas.

53
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.720
Anyway, I wonder whose mansion
their mother was working at.

54
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.120
Iori the butler told me.

55
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.190
It's the mansion of a famous
guy you're quite familiar with.

56
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.490
A famous guy?

57
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.770
The hextuple crown shogi player.

58
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.250
It's the home of Haneda Shukichi's family.

59
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.220
What?

60
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.250
Apparently the rest of the world
doesn't know about it yet.

61
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.700
I-I see.

62
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.910
Isn't Haneda Akai-san's younger
brother and Sera's older brother?

63
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.000
17 years ago, his brother-in-law Haneda Koji

64
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.980
was force fed APTX 4869
by someone in America.

65
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.060
In other words, the quadruple
crown shogi player Haneda Koji

66
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.830
was the son of a wealthy family.

67
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.330
These days, when you search for shogi,
this news story keeps coming up.

68
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.640
The discovery of shogi player Nishikido Kimiharu's (pictured left)
dead body has been surrounded by discussion of the victim's
disappearance just prior to his body's discovery and suspicions
of match fixing.

According to those close to the investigation HQ,
it may be some kind of message from the culprit.

74
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.360
According to those close to the investigation HQ,
it may be some kind of message from the culprit.
"The MPD recently announced that
one of the legs on the shogi board

75
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.890
"The MPD recently announced that
one of the legs on the shogi board

76
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.350
left at the crime scene had been cut off."

77
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.510
Why just one leg of the board?

78
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.460
Hey.

79
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.730
What's "happyakunaga?"

80
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.540
Actually, it'sâ€”

81
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.610
It's read as yaocho (match fixing).

82
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.000
It's when someone deliberately loses a game.

83
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.080
You know, like how Edogawa-kun intentionally
loses to you guys at video games.

84
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.620
What?

85
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.500
You've been doing that on purpose?

86
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.460
You noticed?

87
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.250
Aw, man.

88
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.130
How could you do that
deliberately? That's awful.
Actually, that wasn't on purpose.

89
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.260
Where did the term "yaocho" come from?

90
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.720
I don't know. Sumo, maybe?

91
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.020
Maybe it originated from shogi.

92
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.400
It's not from shogi.

93
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.150
It originally comes from go.

94
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.030
Taiko Meijin!

95
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.910
Long ago, there was a yaoya
(greengrocer) named Chobe.

96
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.370
Yaocho

97
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.830
Yaocho
Everyone called him Yaocho.

98
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.190
He wanted his go friends to buy his products,

99
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.580
so he put them in good moods
by deliberately losing to them.

100
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.840
But one day, Chobe-san played a close
match against a skilled go player,

101
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.840
and people discovered how good
he actually was at the game.

102
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.640
Since then, deliberately losing for
the benefit of yourself or others

103
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.310
has been called yaocho (match fixing).

104
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.250
Hey, Taiko Meijin.

105
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.030
Have you ever played against Nishikido,
the shogi player who was found dead?

106
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.240
Yeah. A few times, at events.

107
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.060
He didn't make much of an impression.

108
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.500
But just once, the move he made after
returning from the bathroom

109
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.650
was so unbelievably brilliant it surprised me.

110
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.340
I still managed to win, though.

111
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.650
Huh.

112
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.240
By the way...

113
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.500
Are you going on a date with Yumi-san today?

114
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.640
What? Wh-What makes you say that?

115
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.900
Because normally you have stubble when you're
not wearing a kimono, but you shaved today.

116
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.350
Now that you mention it...

117
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.270
I didn't notice.

118
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.260
N-No, it's because I'm meeting
someone important.

119
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.900
It's not a date.

120
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.570
Well, see you later.

121
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.280
Aw, so it's not a date.

122
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.910
I thought I was right.

123
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.670
What are you doing, Yumi-san?

124
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.050
Wh-What am I doing?

125
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.840
I'm following Chukichi.

126
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.760
Why are you following him?

127
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.400
Did you have a fight?

128
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.080
No, we didn't have a fight.

129
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.900
But lately Chukichi's been acting strange.

130
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.760
He's been getting dressed up and sneaking out a lot.

131
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.220
When I ask him where he's going,
he dodges the question.

132
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:40.540
S-Since we started living together, I've been
seeing sides of him I don't need to see.

133
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.580
I'm probably overthinking it.

134
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.420
In all likelihood...

135
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.970
In all likelihood?

136
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.970
He's having an affair.

137
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.000
You think so, too?!

138
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.240
It's probably because you
started living together.

139
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.890
Apparently it's common for
men to get comfortable

140
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.980
and cheat once they know they've
locked down the woman they love.

141
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.610
Come on, really?

142
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.610
Damn it, Chukichi.

143
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.210
Looks like I'll have to keep
following him after all.

144
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.490
Good luck with that.

145
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:21.790
Gotcha.

146
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.250
Hey, wait!

147
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.760
You're going to help me.

148
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.250
He's less likely to notice I'm following
him if I've got a kid with me.

149
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.450
There they go.

150
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.380
Good luck, Conan-kun.

151
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.970
Welcome.

152
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.520
Hey, listen.

153
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.360
I'm pretty sure he's just buying donuts.

154
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.150
Yeah.

155
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.160
The question is, who is he buying them for?

156
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.030
He's buying a whole lot of them.

157
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.560
Maybe he's getting together
with friends for drinks.

158
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.090
He could also be seeing a girl who eats a lot.

159
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.540
I-I guess so.

160
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.970
More importantly, have you
met Taiko Meijin's parents?

161
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.800
No, not yet.

162
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.260
I heard he was adopted by
some super rich family

163
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.150
when he was trying to become
a professional shogi player.

164
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.660
The son of the family was some kind of shogi
genius, but he died in an accident.

165
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.190
They asked to adopt him so he
could fulfill their son's dream.

166
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.630
So Haneda Koji really was the
son of a wealthy family,

167
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.560
and Taiko Meijin was adopted by them
so he could carry on his dream.

168
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.210
Apparently the biggest reason Chukichi agreed

169
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.670
to be adopted was because he
became obsessed with shogi.

170
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.710
Huh.

171
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.830
Then have you met Taiko
Meijin's biological family?

172
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.720
I haven't met them yet either.

173
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.420
Apparently he's got a mom, an
older brother, and a younger sister.

174
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.230
I bet the whole family's laid
back and carefree like him.

175
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.730
I don't think a single one of them is carefree.

176
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.290
Thank you very much!

177
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.210
He came back out.

178
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.660
Huh?

179
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.490
Star Donut?

180
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.380
Which means...

181
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.460
No way. This place is Star Donut.

182
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.660
The other day I saw it in a magazine

183
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.460
and suggested to Chukichi
that we come here sometime.

184
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.790
Could it be that Chukichi bought those for me?

185
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.300
Hey, guys!

186
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.230
Huh?

187
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.930
W-Women?

188
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.810
Not only that, but...

189
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.810
Two of them?!

190
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.070
No way. This place is Star Donut.

191
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.180
The other day I saw it in a magazine

192
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.080
and suggested to Chukichi
that we come here sometime.

193
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.380
Could it be that Chukichi bought those for me?

194
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.920
Hey, guys!

195
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.770
Huh?

196
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.550
W-Women?

197
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.430
Not only that, but...

198
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.430
Two of them?!

199
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.980
Hey, these are from Star Donut.

200
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.970
Where's the shop?

201
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.290
Just down the street.

202
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.440
You even know about places like Star Donut?

203
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.870
Aw, shucks.

204
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.080
Yeah, because I saw it in a
magazine and told him about it.

205
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.970
Yeah, that's right. Yumi-tanâ€”

206
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.450
Wait, Y-Yumi-tan?

207
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.110
You seem to be having fun, Chukichi.

208
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.370
H-Having fun?

209
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.270
Yumi-tan? As in Taiko Meijin's
girlfriend Yumi-san?

210
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.010
We hear about you from
the Meijin all the time.

211
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.560
What? Uh, hello.

212
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.900
But, Yumi-tan, what are you doing here?

213
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.640
Huh? Oh, uh...

214
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.410
And what's Conan-kun doing with you?

215
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.240
Yumi-san thought you were cheating onâ€”

216
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.190
Conan-kun insisted on getting Star Donut!

217
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.780
So, what are you guys all doing together?

218
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.780
A shogi study session with those girls?

219
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.010
Yeah. They're female shogi players.

220
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.230
They want to hone their skills at
a high level on a regular basis,

221
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.290
so I attend their sessions sometimes.

222
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.420
I see.

223
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.080
I'm actually doing this because
her father asked me to.

224
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.800
That's right.

225
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.690
Her father?

226
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.210
You know, Katsumata Chikara Osho,
the guy I played against

227
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.560
in my Meijin title match in Yamanashi.

228
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.560
It's time to reveal the sealed move.

229
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.150
The sealed move is 5-6 silver.

230
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.780
The sealed move is 5-6 silver.
Katsumata Chikara

231
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.940
Katsumata Chikara

232
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.120
I need to think.

233
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.130
What? Sextuple Crown Haneda
took a taxi to Tokyo?

234
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:27.920
An unspoken rule forbids him from
using a cell phone during a match.

235
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:34.830
I don't know what happened, but he said
he needed to think before he left.

236
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:41.190
He hasn't thrown in the towel against
Meijin Katsumata Chikara yet.

237
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.660
Let's wait for the man attempting to beat me,

238
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.700
take all seven titles,
and become a living god.

239
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.560
What match?

240
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.750
My Meijin title match was today.

241
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.040
Meijin title match?

242
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.250
Where and when is that?

243
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.260
I'd need to get to the Tokiwa
Hotel in Yamanashi by three.

244
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.920
But there's only an hour and half left, so...

245
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.430
Chukichi, don't underestimate this car.

246
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.700
Thirty seconds.

247
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.960
Thank you for waiting.

248
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.630
I don't mind, but are you all right?

249
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.450
You've used up all your clock time
and have less than a minute to play.

250
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:36.410
Yes. Right now, that minute feels limitless.

251
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.910
Oh, that guy.

252
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.000
I'm Katsumata Mina.

253
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.160
I'm Katsumata Mina.

My father has his hands full
teaching his own students,

255
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.790
My father has his hands full
teaching his own students,

256
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.310
so I asked Haneda Meijin to help me.

257
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.160
And this is my rival.

258
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.170
I'm Uryu Shoko.

259
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.560
I'm Uryu Shoko.

Together, Mina-san and I are working
hard to become female Meijins.

261
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.680
Together, Mina-san and I are working
hard to become female Meijins.

262
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.620
So you always get together
with these two to play shogi?

263
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.110
No, it's not just them.

264
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.140
Apparently Hishinuma-san is already back.

265
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.340
You're right.

266
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.290
Hishinuma-san, the Meijin brought his girlfriend.

267
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.700
What? Seriously?

268
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:13.780
I've been learning a lot from the Meijin.

269
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.810
I've been learning a lot from the Meijin.

272
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.730
Hello.

273
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.790
He participates in our study sessions, too.

274
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.120
It's an honor to meet the Yumi-san.

275
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.250
He's a huge Taiko Meijin fan.

276
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.680
He even copied that bedhead
hairstyle from the Meijin.

277
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:36.930
That's right.

278
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.740
I see.

279
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.710
Chukichi's bedhead is all natural, though.

280
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.210
Anyway, we've got a problem.

281
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.810
I only bought enough coffee for us.

282
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:53.130
This place's coffee has gotten worse, so it's not any different from instant.

283
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.590
What? Really?

284
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.460
Yeah.

285
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.160
Want to try some?

286
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.580
Let me see.

287
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.470
You're right. It tastes worse.

288
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.210
And it's not very hot.

289
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.830
Might be perfect for me. I don't like hot stuff.

290
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:16.130
In contrast, the bread I bought is
freshly baked and piping hot.

291
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.460
Seriously? Wow, you're right.

292
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.380
They're so warm. I bet they're tasty.

293
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.020
Huh?

294
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.560
There's no hot curry bread this time.

295
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.940
Sorry, they were sold out.

296
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.190
Were you able to get the ice cream?

297
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.570
It wasn't too busy today, so I was able to get
some freezing cold ice cream right away.

298
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.720
See?

299
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.330
It's so cold!

300
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.840
Hey, quit it!

301
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.490
This is for not getting my curry bread.

302
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.010
It wasn't my fault.

303
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.740
It wasn't my fault.
Let's not stand around here
talking. Let's go inside.

304
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.840
Let's not stand around here
talking. Let's go inside.

305
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.970
Actually, I've been calling the room,
but Genda-san isn't answering.

306
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.310
Who's Genda-san?

307
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.050
He's a shogi player named Genda Yasukiyo.

308
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.930
He's a shogi player named Genda Yasukiyo.

309
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.970

He's another member of our study group
who's waiting for us in the room.

310
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.480
He's another member of our study group
who's waiting for us in the room.

311
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.010
Maybe he got tired of waiting and fell asleep.

312
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.700
No way.

313
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.480
It's been less than ten minutes since we left.

314
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.490
I've got a spare key. We
can use this to get inside.

315
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.580
You're right. I'm kind of worried, too.

316
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.060
Come in.

317
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:33.500
So you're all pitching in to
rent an apartment, huh?

318
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.140
Yeah, for our study sessions.

319
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.130
It's actually pretty cheap split five ways.

320
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.240
Five ways?

321
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.870
Chukichi, are you paying for this place, too?

322
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.640
No.

323
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.580
There was actually another member,

324
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.670
but apparently he became depressed.

325
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.150
I see.

326
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.160
He's not answering.

327
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.540
It's unlocked.

328
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.790
Come on, man. At least lock the door.

329
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.720
Genda-san, we're back.

330
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.330
Genda-san!

331
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.420
Can you hear me?

332
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.780
Hey, Genda-san.

333
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.600
Genda-san?

334
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.180
Genda-san.

335
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.940
That's odd.

336
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.900
He's not in any of the rooms.

337
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.850
Maybe he went out shopping.

338
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.410
Yeah, right. And left the front door unlocked?

339
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.490
Besides, wouldn't he have called
us if he needed to buy something?

340
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.690
I guess so.

341
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.810
Genda-san?

342
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.500
G-Genda-san!

343
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.500
Hishinuma-san?

344
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.630
Genda-san, are you all right?! Genda-san!

345
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.090
What's wrong, Hishinuma-san? No way!

346
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.250
Genda-san?

347
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.100
You're kidding, right?

348
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.570
Genda-san! Genda-san!

349
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.350
It's no use.

350
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.320
He has no pulse. Looks like he was strangled.

351
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.020
Genda-san! Genda-san!

352
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.110
A shogi board with missing legs?

353
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.920
Could it be?

354
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.560
Yumi-san, call the police and an ambulance.

355
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.490
Got it.

356
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.990
Hello, Miwako?

357
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.580
Something's really wrong with Genda-san.

358
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.390
He's not moving.

359
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.220
How is he, Hishinuma-san?

360
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.790
He's not breathing.

361
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.620
N-No...

362
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.550
He's not dead, is he?

363
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.860
Genda-san, wake up!

364
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.530
Open your eyes, Genda-san!

365
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.550
Hey, Genda-san!

366
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.280
I see.

367
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.490
So Yumi suspected her boyfriend
Haneda Shukichi was cheating,

368
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.170
so she followed him.

369
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.650
She learned he meets a group
of young shogi players

370
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.550
at this apartment for study sessions.

371
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.550
When they came to this room where
the study sessions are held,

372
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.060
this man was found murdered.

373
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.850
Looks like he was strangled.

374
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.440
There are Yoshikawa lines indicating
that the victim resisted.

375
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.440
Yes, which means judging by
the marks left on his neck,

376
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:14.330
the weapon was almost certainly this
electrical cord left by the body.

377
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.990
How could you suspect me
of cheating, Yumi-tan?

378
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:24.710
Because you were hiding
where you were going.

379
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.460
You'd get mad if I told you I
was meeting other women!

380
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.220
I'm not that petty!

381
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.350
Actually, you were pretty petty about it.

382
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.970
You two, no chit chat!

383
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:39.810
Yes, ma'am!
