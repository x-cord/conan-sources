1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.840
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.640
Today's mystery involves the Youth Detective League.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.940
The pictures a child draws hold the key to the case.

5
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:15.353
Just as expected of you, this is a terrible picture, Genta.

9
00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:19.353
Hey, come on, talk for yourself, Mitsuhiko.

10
00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:23.053
Say what you like.

11
00:02:23.053 --> 00:02:26.553
A man's value is not to be judged by the picture he draws.

12
00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:28.053
You're right.

13
00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:33.553
But, people who can draw nicely are admirable

14
00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.453
and I really respect them.

15
00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:37.553
I guess so...

16
00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:41.153
Maybe I'll think of commuting to art class starting tomorrow.

17
00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:43.153
Count me in, too!

18
00:02:44.153 --> 00:02:45.653
Really, I tell you.

19
00:02:51.953 --> 00:02:54.353
"Jukichi Sakai (55)"

20
00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.753
I wonder what he's doing?

21
00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:01.253
What a weird man!

22
00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:03.753
I smell a crime.

23
00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:14.753
What?

24
00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:18.253
-Money? -Talk about a large sum of money, too.

25
00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:25.053
Is that...

26
00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:30.053
Hold it, mister!

27
00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:32.153
Why do you have all that money?

28
00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:34.353
Are you a thief?

29
00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:37.153
No! I'm...

30
00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:38.453
Get him!

31
00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.753
Wait, you guys.

32
00:03:44.853 --> 00:03:47.553
Let me go. The boy...

33
00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.953
The boy will be killed.

34
00:03:52.553 --> 00:03:54.653
What does it mean?

35
00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:56.053
Just as I thought.

36
00:03:57.953 --> 00:04:02.953
"The Kidnapper in the Picture"

37
00:04:11.153 --> 00:04:12.953
"Kenzo Tsubakuro"

38
00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:24.953
My hunch was right after all.

39
00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:29.853
Right. It was a kidnap case.

40
00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:33.353
The one who was kidnapped is...

41
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:35.353
"Kenzo Tsubakuro (70)" -Akio Tsubakuro, age 5,

42
00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:37.553
the grandchild of Kenzo Tsubakuro,

43
00:04:37.553 --> 00:04:39.953
the head of the Tsubakuro Financial Gro.

44
00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:43.753
"Akio Tsubakuro (5)" -He likes to draw pictures.

45
00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:46.353
And the bunch of bills

46
00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:49.753
were ransom money for Akio who had been kidnapped.

47
00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:55.753
All right, then. Mr. Tsubakuro, will you please explain the details?

48
00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:57.353
Get out of here.

49
00:04:57.353 --> 00:04:59.253
Mr. Tsubakuro.

50
00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:02.553
What's this?

51
00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:04.953
It's a picture that Akio drew,

52
00:05:04.953 --> 00:05:08.053
that was sent here from the kidnapper.

53
00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:10.653
When did you receive it?

54
00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:12.953
About noon yesterday...

55
00:05:12.953 --> 00:05:16.853
It was in the mailbox together with the blackmail.

56
00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:19.753
I see.

57
00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:25.753
And that's the blackmail.

58
00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:29.753
"Price of your child, 10 billion yen. Clown."

59
00:05:30.553 --> 00:05:31.653
Cool.

60
00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:33.553
How many servings of eel over rice can you eat with that amount?

61
00:05:33.553 --> 00:05:35.753
Come on, Genta!

62
00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:37.453
But, the money we just saw a while ago,

63
00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:40.353
was far from 10 billion yen.

64
00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:41.953
That money was just to display

65
00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:46.553
whether they really had the will to pay the ransom amount or not.

66
00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:48.253
I'm sure that the kidnapper back then was...

67
00:05:56.653 --> 00:05:58.653
Right?

68
00:05:58.653 --> 00:06:00.853
Yes, that's right.

69
00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:03.753
Hey, I appreciate you reporting the case to the police,

70
00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:05.753
but from here, we the police will take care of things.

71
00:06:05.753 --> 00:06:07.453
So, go and hurry on home.

72
00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:14.453
Inspector, you the police are also going home.

73
00:06:14.453 --> 00:06:16.653
But, Mr. Tsubakuro...

74
00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:19.753
Akio is my precious one and only grandson

75
00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:21.853
that my son and his wife had left behind

76
00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:24.353
after they died of a traffic accident last year.

77
00:06:24.353 --> 00:06:26.153
If anything happens to him,

78
00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:29.553
I wouldn't be able to face up to them.

79
00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:34.053
I understand how you feel, Mr. Tsubakuro.

80
00:06:34.053 --> 00:06:35.753
But the moment of contact with the kidnapper

81
00:06:35.753 --> 00:06:38.153
when the ransom money is to be exchanged for the kidnapped

82
00:06:38.153 --> 00:06:41.353
is the best time to arrest the kidnapper.

83
00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:44.053
10 billion yen is quite heavy to carry,

84
00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:45.153
therefore, the kidnapper...

85
00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:46.553
No!

86
00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:49.553
I don't care whether the kidnapper is caught or not.

87
00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:52.753
I don't want to endanger Akio's life.

88
00:06:52.753 --> 00:06:55.653
Besides, I have no intention to give the kidnapper the money.

89
00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:01.253
Just what do you mean?

90
00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:07.753
This was in the mailbox this morning.

91
00:07:08.753 --> 00:07:10.653
Account where the money is to be transferred

92
00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:13.853
to Swiss Fontvelle Bank.

93
00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:17.753
Swiss Bank?

94
00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:20.853
Inspector, we'd better order stop payment

95
00:07:20.853 --> 00:07:24.253
or ask the bank to tell us who the account belongs to.

96
00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:25.353
It's no use.

97
00:07:26.353 --> 00:07:28.753
Switzerland is a bank nation.

98
00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:30.453
If things go that easily,

99
00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:33.853
the existence of the banks in Switzerland would lose their meaning.

100
00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.653
Oh, God.

101
00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:38.553
I hate to say so.

102
00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:41.253
But, it's just as the boy says.

103
00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:43.853
No matter what the case, they are no exceptions.

104
00:07:43.853 --> 00:07:48.753
But if by doing so, Akio is going to come back safe.

105
00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:51.553
So, please. Leave!

106
00:07:53.253 --> 00:07:54.653
Mr. Tsubakuro.

107
00:07:57.653 --> 00:07:59.153
Then...

108
00:07:59.153 --> 00:08:00.353
This is...

109
00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:02.453
A perfect crime?

110
00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:10.553
Inspector.

111
00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:14.153
Don't tell me that you gave up on the investigation.

112
00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:15.653
Of course.

113
00:08:15.653 --> 00:08:18.053
As long as Mr. Tsubakuro wants it that way,

114
00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:21.753
we can't involve ourselves in his paying the ransom.

115
00:08:21.753 --> 00:08:23.353
However, being the police,

116
00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:27.053
we can't let such a ruthless crime go unchecked.

117
00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:29.553
Which means that as soon as the ransom is paid

118
00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:31.853
and Akio is returned safely,

119
00:08:31.853 --> 00:08:35.053
you're going to start an all-out investigation, right?

120
00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:36.953
Exactly.

121
00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.853
But, even if the ransom is paid,

122
00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:46.353
there is no guarantee that Akio will return safely.

123
00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:54.553
Akio really likes to draw, doesn't he?

124
00:08:57.953 --> 00:08:59.053
This is...

125
00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:07.753
What's up, Conan?

126
00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:10.053
Conan?

127
00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:16.253
Mr. Tsubakuro, will you please show me Akio's picture one more time?

128
00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:22.953
Just as I thought, it's here too.

129
00:09:23.953 --> 00:09:26.553
That's Akio's habit.

130
00:09:26.553 --> 00:09:27.753
Habit?

131
00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:29.253
When he draws a picture,

132
00:09:29.253 --> 00:09:33.153
he draws whatever catches his attention as his signature.

133
00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:35.353
Whatever catches his attention?

134
00:09:35.353 --> 00:09:39.653
Come to think of it, I think I've seen the same thing somewhere before.

135
00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:42.753
Really? Where?

136
00:09:44.153 --> 00:09:46.653
I wonder where it was?

137
00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:49.953
Oh, that's right.

138
00:09:49.953 --> 00:09:53.753
When I went to South Beika Kindergarten where Akio goes to,

139
00:09:53.753 --> 00:09:56.953
I was shown a picture that he drew.

140
00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:59.453
South Beika Kindergarten, I got it.

141
00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.653
Mr. Tsubakuro, please lend me this picture,

142
00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:04.453
-I'll bring it right back. -Hey, sonny.

143
00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:10.953
"South Beika Kindergarten"

144
00:10:12.853 --> 00:10:14.853
Excuse me!

145
00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:16.753
Do you want anything, sonny?

146
00:10:16.753 --> 00:10:20.953
I would like to have a look at the picture that Akio Tsubakuro had drawn.

147
00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.853
Akio's drawing?

148
00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:26.553
The one that Akio's grandfather looked

149
00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:29.553
as is probably this picture posted here.

150
00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:33.153
There.

151
00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:34.353
This is the one.

152
00:10:35.753 --> 00:10:39.853
Teacher, where did Akio draw this picture?

153
00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:47.353
No doubt about it.

154
00:10:47.353 --> 00:10:50.453
That signature is the same as the one that Akio drew.

155
00:10:51.453 --> 00:10:55.653
Moreover, the one that was sent over is what he drew in confinement.

156
00:10:58.453 --> 00:10:59.853
Which means...

157
00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:01.953
If I can figure out where this is,

158
00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.953
I'll be able to find where Akio is being confined.

159
00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:07.753
But the problem is...

160
00:11:07.753 --> 00:11:08.753
Conan!

161
00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.553
Just what do you think you're doing, Conan?

162
00:11:11.553 --> 00:11:13.453
It's not fair leaving us out, you know?

163
00:11:13.453 --> 00:11:15.553
No, I didn't mean to...

164
00:11:15.553 --> 00:11:16.853
Don't play dumb with us.

165
00:11:16.853 --> 00:11:20.353
I'll bet you're planning to rescue Akio all by yourself.

166
00:11:20.353 --> 00:11:22.353
We'll help you out.

167
00:11:22.353 --> 00:11:24.653
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:11:24.653 --> 00:11:27.153
We're dealing with a kidnapper, you know.

169
00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:28.453
We can never tell what kind of danger we may be encountering.

170
00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:30.153
But still...

171
00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:33.153
Take a look at this picture, Akio looks so happy.

172
00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:34.153
Yes.

173
00:11:34.153 --> 00:11:37.553
He's enjoying watching TV with the kidnapper and laughing.

174
00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:41.253
-Yes. This is Kamen Yaiba, isn't it? -Yeah.

175
00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:45.453
As far as this picture goes, it doesn't look like he's in any danger.

176
00:11:45.453 --> 00:11:47.353
If we're going to rescue him, it's now.

177
00:11:47.353 --> 00:11:48.853
-Yes. -Yes.

178
00:11:48.853 --> 00:11:52.053
Conan, that's what you were thinking too, right?

179
00:11:52.053 --> 00:11:54.053
You guys...

180
00:11:54.053 --> 00:11:57.753
Besides, this is a case that we brought attention to.

181
00:11:57.753 --> 00:11:59.453
-Right. -Right.

182
00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:02.653
Okay.

183
00:12:02.653 --> 00:12:05.553
But, only until we find the place he's confined in.

184
00:12:05.553 --> 00:12:08.353
After that, we leave everything in the hands of the police!

185
00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:12.153
His signature?

186
00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:13.853
I see.

187
00:12:13.853 --> 00:12:16.953
But, what is it he drew here?

188
00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:18.553
A spaceman?

189
00:12:18.553 --> 00:12:22.753
Isn't this a chimney attached to some building?

190
00:12:22.753 --> 00:12:24.853
No, I'm sure it's a spaceman!

191
00:12:24.853 --> 00:12:27.853
What makes you think he can see a spaceman from here?

192
00:12:27.853 --> 00:12:31.253
But, there's no chimney in the view from here either.

193
00:12:31.253 --> 00:12:33.553
Well, that's true.

194
00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:35.653
This is no time to be arguing!

195
00:12:35.653 --> 00:12:38.053
It doesn't matter whether it's a chimney or a building.

196
00:12:38.053 --> 00:12:40.953
Let's split up and look for the thing that looks like this signature.

197
00:12:40.953 --> 00:12:42.353
Okay...

198
00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:03.953
There it is!

199
00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:08.053
Really, Ayumi?

200
00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:11.153
Look, isn't that it?

201
00:13:11.153 --> 00:13:13.153
It's a water supply tower.

202
00:13:13.153 --> 00:13:15.153
-But... -It sort of looks like it.

203
00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:16.753
But kind of doesn't look like it.

204
00:13:16.753 --> 00:13:20.553
I'm sure that's it!

205
00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:22.553
Really?

206
00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:25.753
How can you be so sure?

207
00:13:25.753 --> 00:13:27.353
Look.

208
00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:30.853
What do you see in the foreground of that water supply tower?

209
00:13:32.953 --> 00:13:35.453
It's a clock.

210
00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:38.553
-A park? -Yeah.

211
00:13:38.553 --> 00:13:39.853
So, what?

212
00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:42.553
A park is not included in his signature.

213
00:13:42.553 --> 00:13:45.753
Take a good look.

214
00:13:45.753 --> 00:13:47.153
There's something that looks like eyeballs

215
00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:49.253
in the middle of the signature, isn't there?

216
00:13:49.253 --> 00:13:50.853
True.

217
00:13:50.853 --> 00:13:53.453
Definitely.

218
00:13:53.453 --> 00:13:56.253
How would you see if the water supply tower

219
00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:57.953
and clock overlap on each other?

220
00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:03.353
Right, the thing that looked like an eyeball on the signature

221
00:14:03.353 --> 00:14:05.253
was that clock.

222
00:14:05.253 --> 00:14:08.953
Which means that Akio is in the water supply tower?

223
00:14:08.953 --> 00:14:11.453
No, he's at a place

224
00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:14.853
where he sees the water supply tower and clock overlap.

225
00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.453
I see.

226
00:14:16.453 --> 00:14:19.553
Let's go to the water supply tower, then.

227
00:14:19.553 --> 00:14:23.253
Maybe we can see where Akio is.

228
00:14:23.253 --> 00:14:25.053
Okay, let's go!

229
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:42.661
How is it, Conan?

230
00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:43.861
Yeah.

231
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:47.761
That place in the view over there is the park with the clock.

232
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:51.461
The eyeball of Akio's signature is drawn

233
00:14:51.461 --> 00:14:55.361
so that it fits right into the center of the water supply tower.

234
00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.961
In other words,

235
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.361
although there may be slight differences,

236
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:03.361
Akio is most likely confined somewhere within this range.

237
00:15:06.361 --> 00:15:08.761
Talk about a lot of houses.

238
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:12.261
It's hard to tell from here, after all.

239
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:13.961
If we all split up and search,

240
00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:15.761
I'm sure we'll find him in no time at all.

241
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:18.361
Okay. Let's give it a try.

242
00:15:18.361 --> 00:15:19.661
Okay...

243
00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:27.361
If you see any suspicious person or house,

244
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.261
use your badge and call immediately.

245
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.561
Don't ever attempt to go after the kidnapper alone

246
00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:34.861
or even think of attempting to rescue Akio on your own.

247
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:00.861
How was it?

248
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:03.861
There were quite a few suspicious-looking places.

249
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:08.061
But there was nothing all that conclusive of any one of those places.

250
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:09.461
There are too many places yet,

251
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:11.761
to really narrow down the place of confinement.

252
00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:14.561
Where's Ayumi?

253
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:15.761
Huh?

254
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:19.161
We were all supposed to meet at the park at 5 pm.

255
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:26.261
Yes. This is Ayumi.

256
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:29.561
Ayumi, where are you?

257
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:30.961
Conan.

258
00:16:30.961 --> 00:16:34.161
I figured Akio might be hungry,

259
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.861
so I was shopping at a convenience store.

260
00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:38.261
Come on!

261
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:41.461
It's way past the promised time, you know?

262
00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:43.461
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.061
I'll be right there, so wait for me just a while more...

264
00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:47.261
Huh?

265
00:16:50.461 --> 00:16:52.561
A clown's mask.

266
00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:56.061
Huh? What did you just say? I couldn't hear you too well.

267
00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:01.761
Ayumi? Is anything wrong?

268
00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:05.861
What's up, Ayumi?

269
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:07.961
I've found a suspicious-looking person.

270
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:09.561
A suspicious person?

271
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.461
The kidnapper?

272
00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:14.761
I'm not sure yet, but the clown that Akio drew was wearing

273
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:18.161
a triangular hat with a star on it, and had green hair.

274
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:21.061
It was holding the remote controller with its left hand, wasn't it?

275
00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:23.261
Wait a sec.

276
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:25.161
Yep, it's exactly as she says.

277
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:26.761
No doubt about it.

278
00:17:26.761 --> 00:17:30.061
It means that the kidnapper is left-handed, right?

279
00:17:30.061 --> 00:17:33.461
Ayumi, don't do anything rash. Listen to me, will you?

280
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:35.661
Oh, wait.

281
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:37.561
Ayumi?

282
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.361
I've found him.

283
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:47.761
I'm sure he's the one who kidnapped Akio.

284
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:49.461
I'm going to go after him.

285
00:17:49.461 --> 00:17:51.661
Don't, Ayumi!

286
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:53.761
It's dangerous, Ayumi!

287
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:55.661
Answer us, Ayumi!

288
00:17:55.661 --> 00:17:56.661
I'll be fine.

289
00:17:56.661 --> 00:17:59.061
But, I don't want the kidnapper to find me out,

290
00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:02.061
so I'll contact you all later, over.

291
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:04.061
She cut us off?

292
00:18:04.061 --> 00:18:05.061
Ayumi.

293
00:18:05.061 --> 00:18:06.461
Ayumi!

294
00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:09.861
Darn it. How could she...

295
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:25.061
Hey, Conan.

296
00:18:25.061 --> 00:18:29.261
How long are we going to wait here for Ayumi to get in touch with us?

297
00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:33.461
If anything should ever happen to Ayumi, it's all our fault.

298
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:39.161
Oh, right.

299
00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:42.661
Can't you track where Ayumi is with that glasses of yours?

300
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:44.361
Genta, I can't...

301
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:48.061
Dr. Agasa is fixing my tracking glasses for me now.

302
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:52.661
Sitting here doing nothing isn't going to get us anywhere.

303
00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:56.361
-Let's go look one more time. -Look where?

304
00:18:56.361 --> 00:18:58.161
It's better...

305
00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:01.461
It's Ayumi!

306
00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:03.561
Hello, Ayumi?

307
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:08.061
"Tohto Paint Factory"

308
00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:41.061
Hi, sonny, I'll bet you're hungry?

309
00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:44.961
I bought you some sandwiches. And crayons and drawing paper, too.

310
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:49.461
Thank you, Mr. Clown.

311
00:19:54.861 --> 00:20:00.261
While you were out shopping, I drew a lot of pictures, Mr. Clown.

312
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:02.361
Oh, really? Good for you.

313
00:20:02.361 --> 00:20:05.561
Who is it?

314
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:08.161
I...

315
00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:10.061
Who are you?

316
00:20:10.061 --> 00:20:14.361
Akio! You'll be all right now because we've all come to save you.

317
00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:15.461
Who are you?

318
00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:16.761
How did you come here?

319
00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:22.861
Hold it!

320
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:24.361
That's it!

321
00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:31.561
Hey! Kidnapper!

322
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:34.161
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad are taking you on.

323
00:20:34.161 --> 00:20:35.861
Give yourself in quietly.

324
00:20:35.861 --> 00:20:36.961
That's right.

325
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:38.661
Darn it.

326
00:20:40.061 --> 00:20:41.661
Come, kid.

327
00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:45.461
Mitsuhiko, there he goes!

328
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.461
You're not getting away.

329
00:20:50.461 --> 00:20:51.961
Conan!

330
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.661
We did it...

331
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:08.661
Akio!

332
00:21:09.661 --> 00:21:12.261
Are you all right, Akio?

333
00:21:12.261 --> 00:21:15.761
I'm all right.

334
00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:20.961
Akio. I'm so glad, really glad that you're safe!

335
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:24.061
We did it, didn't we, Conan?

336
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:26.161
Our strategy worked.

337
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.661
Yeah.

338
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:31.361
A great victory once again for the Youth Detective Squad!

339
00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:03.961
After that, Inspector Megure and the other officers

340
00:23:03.961 --> 00:23:07.761
who got our report came to the scene and arrested the kidnapper.

341
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:10.761
But, as for us...

342
00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:13.461
You idiots!

343
00:23:13.461 --> 00:23:17.661
Just as expected, we were bawled out by Inspector Megure.

344
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:21.961
Bye, bye, Ayumi!

345
00:23:21.961 --> 00:23:26.261
Thank you, big brothers of the Youth Detective Squad!

346
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:27.761
Bye...

347
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:30.861
Let's hang out next time, Akio!

348
00:23:30.861 --> 00:23:33.161
Bye!

349
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:36.061
He said thank you.

350
00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:38.961
It sure feels good to be thanked.

351
00:23:42.061 --> 00:23:45.361
Akio sure draws well after all.

352
00:23:45.361 --> 00:23:46.561
Where? Let's take a look.

353
00:23:52.361 --> 00:23:54.361
-Conan! -Conan!

354
00:23:54.361 --> 00:23:56.161
What?

355
00:23:56.161 --> 00:23:57.861
Wait up, Conan!

356
00:23:57.861 --> 00:24:00.161
How dare you take the frosting and the cake again!

357
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:03.661
Seriously. How come things turn out this way?

358
00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:07.261
"Next Episode" -Mail?

359
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:11.361
Thief! Somebody stop him!

360
00:24:12.361 --> 00:24:13.761
He went into the alley!

361
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:14.861
Don't let him get away!

362
00:24:17.761 --> 00:24:21.061
