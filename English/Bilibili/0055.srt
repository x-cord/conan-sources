1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.510
As long as modern-day
crimes involve people,

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.390
there are no
unsolvable mysteries!

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.210
Today's case is a train trick!

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.260
Schedules are
the basis of judgment!

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.050
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.390
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.220
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.359
The Train Trick Murder Case.

9
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.239
Yu-no-Yama (Mountain Hot Spring Town)

10
00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.659
Yu-no-Yama Station

11
00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.669
Dad! Hurry!

12
00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:53.089
Where're we going?
Aren't we getting on this?

13
00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:56.159
No, this is the Hana-no-Machi Line.

14
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.549
We're riding the one up
there, the Yu-no-Yama Line.

15
00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.909
It doesn't matter which one we take--

16
00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.989
both lines connect
to a Tokyo-bound line

17
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.269
at Hana-no-Machi
Station anyways...

18
00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.809
We'll miss the train
if we don't hurry!

19
00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.659
My head's pounding
from this hangover...

20
00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.149
Don't shout so loud...

21
00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.069
Ugh. I don't feel up to this...

22
00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.909
That was fun!

23
00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.029
The food, the inn, and
the hot spring were all great!

24
00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.379
Don't you agree, Conan-kun?

25
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.089
Yeah!

26
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.319
Thanks, Dad!

27
00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.029
One of your clients invited you on this trip

28
00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.659
as a reward for
solving their case!

29
00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.019
Yeah...

30
00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.229
Though I'm the one
who solved the case, not him...

31
00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.779
I'm gonna sleep for an hour
until we get to Hana-no-Machi.

32
00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:01.909
What the hell?!

33
00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.659
What's your problem, Sato?!

34
00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.159
What's the matter?
You don't need to get so mad...

35
00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.109
You disgust me!

36
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.579
I can't bear to sit
with you any more!

37
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:16.119
I'm going to a different car!

38
00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.839
Hey, Date!
I'm going to a different car!

39
00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.779
Aren't they--

40
00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.409
Yeah, they stayed at the
same inn as us last night.

41
00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.449
Kan'etsu Medical Association

42
00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.559
Pardon me...

43
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.249
Ah, that group of doctors...

44
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.279
Hello!

45
00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.449
Oh, you're from last night...

46
00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.359
Did something happen?

47
00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.489
No, he's just upset.

48
00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.579
Where are the other doctors?

49
00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.819
We all left separately.

50
00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.659
Some took the Hana-no-Machi Line

51
00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.989
while others took the
Yu-no-Yama Line like us.

52
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.209
Both lines end at
Hana-no-Machi Station anyway.

53
00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.129
Well, then. Nighty-night.

54
00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.409
Mizu-no-Kawa! Mizu-no-Kawa!

55
00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.739
Huh? Mizu-no-Kawa Station?

56
00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.199
Oh, it says we can transfer.

57
00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.619
Maybe we should transfer
to the Hana-no-Machi Line here?

58
00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:33.819
Bzzt! Too bad!

59
00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.989
The Hana-no-Machi train
arrived here at exactly 10:30.

60
00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:40.039
That was five minutes ago.
It's long gone by now.

61
00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.049
Bah.

62
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:57.439
Sorry to disturb you.
Tickets, please.

63
00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.889
Here you go.

64
00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.229
Thanks, little boy!

65
00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:06.239
Mizu-no-Kawa Station

66
00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:11.069
Yu-no-Yama Line
Hana-no-Machi Line

67
00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.199
Hana-no-Machi Station

68
00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.199
Thank you for using
the Yu-no-Yama Line today.

69
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.199
This is our last stop,
Hana-no-Machi Station.

70
00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.169
Please look around once more to
avoid forgetting anything onboard.

71
00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.689
Passengers transferring
to the Tokyo-bound train

72
00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.359
will need to switch to Platform 7.

73
00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:30.029
The next train will leave at 11:40.

74
00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.349
Thirty-five minutes of waiting...

75
00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.539
Hey! Sato-kun!

76
00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.489
Sorry about earlier.

77
00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:45.529
I calmed down after looking at
the scenery from the very last car.

78
00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.249
I thought you might!

79
00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.989
Sorry 'bout that!

80
00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.779
Sounds like they made up!

81
00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.449
Yeah!

82
00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.739
Here you are.

83
00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:56.779
Thanks.

84
00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:57.689
Here you go.

85
00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.339
He sure has a lot of change...

86
00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.919
Well, it was nice to meet you...

87
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.049
Likewise!

88
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.259
Hey, Mister! Your button's
about to come off!

89
00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.809
Oh, it's fine.

90
00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:25.269
He wiped it! How odd...

91
00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:30.069
Where was the body found?!

92
00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.989
Inside the Hana-no-Machi
train that arrived five minutes ago!

93
00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:35.369
The victim appears to be a doctor!

94
00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:38.989
What if it's a
doctor from our group?!

95
00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:40.909
Everyone did leave by themselves--

96
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.159
one of them could have been
on the Hana-no-Machi Line!

97
00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.889
Let's check it out!

98
00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:44.519
Yeah!

99
00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.419
I'm going too.

100
00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.579
Dad! What about your hangover?

101
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:52.879
It's long gone.

102
00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.029
I can't stay silent after
hearing there's a dead body.

103
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:58.969
Detective Kogoro Mori's
excitement has been piqued!

104
00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:13.949
It's Utsumi-kun!

105
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.819
So he was in your
medical association?

106
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.199
It's Utsumi-kun.
He was with us last night.

107
00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.539
What's with that look?!

108
00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:33.009
I'm Chief Railway Officer,
Yosuke Kobayashi.

109
00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.529
It's an honor to meet you,
Detective Mori!

110
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:38.509
Your cooperation is
greatly appreciated!

111
00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.519
No problem. I'm glad to help.

112
00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.399
So, what was the cause of death?

113
00:07:49.109 --> 00:07:51.159
We won't know for
sure until the autopsy,

114
00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.069
but my guess is cardiac arrest.

115
00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.239
If so, I'm of no use here.

116
00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:59.489
Say, isn't that a syringe mark?

117
00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:02.659
You keep quiet! Wait, a syringe?

118
00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:05.039
Look at the vein on his arm.

119
00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.359
There's a needle
mark with blood on it.

120
00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:09.889
A mark from a hypodermic needle?

121
00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:12.669
There's no doubt about it.

122
00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:16.779
When intravenously given high
doses of potassium chloride,

123
00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.319
people can die with
symptoms just like cardiac arrest.

124
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:20.889
Shut up!

125
00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:25.229
Hospitals have potassium
chloride and syringes, right?

126
00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:29.359
Wow. You sure know a lot, little boy!

127
00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:33.029
I really like science stuff!

128
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:34.719
That was close!

129
00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:39.009
But I don't see
any syringes anywhere...

130
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:40.449
Which means...

131
00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:42.909
This was neither
an accident nor a suicide!

132
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.409
It was a homicide! A murder!

133
00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:46.159
Why, you...

134
00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.949
You're in the way! Go outside!

135
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:49.499
Alright!

136
00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:52.609
Now, then. The question is motive.

137
00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:53.959
It was a simple robbery.

138
00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:56.929
There's not a
single yen left in his wallet.

139
00:08:57.819 --> 00:08:59.889
And why are his fingers broken?

140
00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:02.489
The killer was macho!

141
00:09:02.489 --> 00:09:04.569
The killer held him down
so hard that it broke his fingers,

142
00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:08.189
prevented him from fighting back,
and then committed the crime!

143
00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:11.199
Would they really go through
the trouble of giving him a shot

144
00:09:11.199 --> 00:09:12.399
just for that?!

145
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:16.069
The Hana-no-Machi line runs
parallel to the Yu-no-Yama line,

146
00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:17.279
which we took.

147
00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:20.239
The Yu-no-Yama
and Mizu-no-Kawa stations

148
00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:22.239
are the only places they meet.

149
00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:24.319
The train this happened on

150
00:09:24.319 --> 00:09:28.489
stopped at Mizu-no-Kawa
Station at 10:30.

151
00:09:28.489 --> 00:09:30.749
The question is
the time of the murder...

152
00:09:30.749 --> 00:09:35.799
So the victim bought the
canned coffee at around 10:50?

153
00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:36.909
Yes.

154
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.239
We had almost arrived
at Hana-no-Machi,

155
00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:41.969
and he was my last customer...

156
00:09:41.969 --> 00:09:44.139
I didn't have any 1000-yen
bills to give him change with,

157
00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:47.669
so I gave him his change in coins,
which is why I remember him.

158
00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:52.159
Was he sitting
by himself at the time?

159
00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:54.269
Yes.

160
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.489
And immediately afterward,

161
00:09:56.489 --> 00:10:01.029
a mustached-man in a dark blue
jacket and sunglasses sat next to him,

162
00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:03.489
so you got up and left.

163
00:10:04.489 --> 00:10:05.369
Yes.

164
00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:07.619
A dark blue jacket?!

165
00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:12.539
So the crime took place between
10:50 and 10:52 or 10:53.

166
00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:18.049
That Dr. Date's
jacket is reversible!

167
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:19.719
The other side is dark blue!

168
00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:24.819
Maybe his button
was about to come off

169
00:10:24.819 --> 00:10:27.099
because the victim had grabbed it?!

170
00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:30.439
He broke his fingers
trying to remove it!

171
00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:32.859
So that's why he--

172
00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:33.939
There's no doubt about it!

173
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.069
He wiped the front of the button

174
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:38.809
to remove the victim's fingerprints!

175
00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:42.409
And the victim died from an
injection of potassium chloride,

176
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:45.409
which would be difficult
for anyone but a doctor to get!

177
00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:48.329
Plus his reaction when
he heard the old man's name!

178
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:51.909
Dr. Date's probably the one responsible!

179
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:57.379
But how could he have killed
someone on a different train?!

180
00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:03.989
Say, aren't you
going to do your job?

181
00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:05.279
Of course not.

182
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.989
They've got a search
out for the robber.

183
00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:09.469
My job here is done.

184
00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:12.309
But was this really a robbery?

185
00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:15.019
What do you mean, Conan-kun?

186
00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:20.989
That witness lady seems
a lot richer than the victim.

187
00:11:20.989 --> 00:11:23.159
And she was sitting nearby, right?

188
00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:28.199
Why would the killer go after
the man instead of the woman?

189
00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:31.109
That's a good question...

190
00:11:31.109 --> 00:11:33.159
That is strange...

191
00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:36.129
Say, why do you suppose
that guy's sweating so much?

192
00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.169
Dr. Sato.

193
00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:42.859
You wouldn't happen to
know something, would you?

194
00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:45.139
Eh? No, not really...

195
00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:48.659
I don't mind.
Tell him, Sato-kun.

196
00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:54.099
Tell him that I had a big argument
with Utsumi at the inn yesterday.

197
00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:57.529
An argument? With the victim?

198
00:11:57.529 --> 00:11:59.109
Is this true?!

199
00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:01.069
Yeah. It was a big one, too.

200
00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:03.069
What caused it?

201
00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:05.529
An unfounded accusation...

202
00:12:06.529 --> 00:12:10.449
...that I was receiving kickbacks
from a pharmaceutical company.

203
00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:13.959
Of course, I'm completely innocent.

204
00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:17.919
Oh, man. You don't seriously
think I killed him, do you?

205
00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:19.949
No, nothing of the sort.

206
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:23.159
It's clear that you and the
victim were on different trains

207
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:27.089
from what Mori-san
and the others have said.

208
00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:30.049
Yes, Dr. Date does have an alibi.

209
00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.859
Say, why did you
take the Yu-no-Yama Line

210
00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:37.819
instead of the Hana-no-Machi Line?

211
00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:40.449
I could have ridden either one,

212
00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:42.729
but Dr. Date bought me the ticket, so...

213
00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:44.689
Then what was
that argument earlier?

214
00:12:45.489 --> 00:12:48.029
I tried to pay
him back for my ticket,

215
00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:50.239
but he refused to accept my money.

216
00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:54.039
He suddenly got angry
when I insisted he take it...

217
00:12:54.739 --> 00:12:56.659
I didn't know what to
think when he blew up like that...

218
00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:59.449
So Dr. Date suggested
taking the Yu-no-Yama Line

219
00:12:59.449 --> 00:13:04.589
and then faked an argument
to move to the rear car...

220
00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:07.659
Hey, Ran.
Can I see the train schedule?

221
00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:09.989
The train schedule? Sure.

222
00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:11.159
Here you are!

223
00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.599
Thanks!

224
00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:18.559
If he had transferred
to the Hana-no-Machi Line...

225
00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:22.029
...Mizu-no-Kawa Station
would be the only place to do it!

226
00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:26.529
But the Hana-no-Machi
train the victim was on

227
00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:29.559
arrived at Mizu-no-Kawa
Station at 10:30.

228
00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:35.699
Our Yu-no-Yama train
arrived five minutes later.

229
00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.159
The Hana-no-Machi train
was long gone by then!

230
00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:40.459
Maybe he couldn't
have done it after all?

231
00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:42.379
Wait a second! Didn't it say--

232
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.359
The Yu-no-Yama Line is Line 1.

233
00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:47.339
The Hana-no-Machi Line is Line 6.

234
00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:51.919
An overpass connects
Platforms 3 and 4.

235
00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:55.659
The stairs are right
next to the rear car,

236
00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:58.539
which Dr. Date had all to himself!

237
00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:03.859
Hey. Sounds like I'll
be held up a little bit longer.

238
00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:05.909
Can you close
the office up for today?

239
00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:07.989
Great. Thanks.

240
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:10.489
A phone?

241
00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:11.449
A cell phone!

242
00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:16.239
Oh no! I left Sonoko's
present on the train!

243
00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.409
That's it!

244
00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:22.069
Now I understand the trick
Dr. Date used to switch trains!

245
00:14:29.737 --> 00:14:32.607
Come on.

246
00:14:32.607 --> 00:14:34.797
If you forgot something,
then ask Ran!

247
00:14:35.607 --> 00:14:39.567
No! It's the killer
I want you to find!

248
00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:46.097
Oh? Is it my hangover?

249
00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:52.237
Thank you so much!

250
00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:54.487
This is Kogoro Mori.

251
00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:58.607
Would those involved please
assemble in the staff room?

252
00:14:58.607 --> 00:14:59.657
Dad!

253
00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:04.277
I've identified the real person
responsible for this incident.

254
00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:07.877
Dr. Date and Dr. Sato.
Please come as well.

255
00:15:08.397 --> 00:15:09.947
The real person responsible?!

256
00:15:09.947 --> 00:15:11.707
It wasn't a robbery?

257
00:15:15.237 --> 00:15:17.607
We're busy, you know.

258
00:15:17.607 --> 00:15:19.507
What is this all about, Mori-san?

259
00:15:19.777 --> 00:15:24.477
Don't worry, the truth will become
clear in only fifteen minutes.

260
00:15:24.937 --> 00:15:27.897
You're saying you'll point out
the killer and have him arrested

261
00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:29.437
in those fifteen minutes?

262
00:15:29.437 --> 00:15:31.437
Indeed, I am, Dr. Date.

263
00:15:34.687 --> 00:15:36.987
In other words, you're going
to try to arrest me.

264
00:15:36.987 --> 00:15:39.437
Yes. The real person
responsible for this incident

265
00:15:39.437 --> 00:15:41.947
is you, Dr. Date!

266
00:15:41.947 --> 00:15:43.107
What?!

267
00:15:43.107 --> 00:15:44.247
No way!

268
00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:45.647
But, Dad!

269
00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:49.077
He was on the same
Yu-no-Yama train as us!

270
00:15:49.077 --> 00:15:53.527
We can only confirm that for the first
five minutes after the train departed.

271
00:15:53.527 --> 00:15:56.757
We didn't see him again until we
arrived at Hana-no-Machi Station.

272
00:15:57.897 --> 00:15:59.777
That's true...

273
00:15:59.777 --> 00:16:01.217
Did he transfer?

274
00:16:01.217 --> 00:16:03.677
Yes. At Mizu-no-Kawa Station.

275
00:16:03.677 --> 00:16:05.527
At Mizu-no-Kawa?

276
00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:07.887
But isn't that impossible, time-wise?

277
00:16:08.737 --> 00:16:09.847
Take a good look.

278
00:16:10.357 --> 00:16:15.737
The Yu-no-Yama train arrived on
Platform 1 of Mizu-no-Kawa Station

279
00:16:15.737 --> 00:16:18.277
at 10:35.

280
00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:22.777
Long after the Hana-no-Machi
train on Platform 6 had left!

281
00:16:22.777 --> 00:16:24.827
How could I have
possibly transferred trains?!

282
00:16:24.827 --> 00:16:28.537
A single phone call
would make it possible.

283
00:16:30.237 --> 00:16:31.457
A phone call?

284
00:16:31.817 --> 00:16:34.187
If you call from a cell
phone one train stop ahead

285
00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:38.107
and ask them to hold
the Hana-no-Machi train

286
00:16:38.107 --> 00:16:40.717
because you left something on it...

287
00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:45.527
10:35.

288
00:16:45.527 --> 00:16:47.737
Before you arrived
at Mizu-no-Kawa Station,

289
00:16:47.737 --> 00:16:51.277
you turned your
reversible jacket inside-out

290
00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:53.737
and disguised yourself with
a fake mustache and other props.

291
00:16:55.437 --> 00:16:57.397
When you arrived at the station,

292
00:16:57.397 --> 00:16:59.187
you ran up the overpass

293
00:16:59.187 --> 00:17:02.157
and headed for
Line 6 as fast as possible.

294
00:17:02.737 --> 00:17:05.117
That's why you started
an argument with Dr. Sato

295
00:17:05.117 --> 00:17:09.397
and moved to the last car
immediately after the train departed.

296
00:17:09.397 --> 00:17:11.777
You had the train employees
search for a missing item

297
00:17:11.777 --> 00:17:13.937
to delay the Hana-no-Machi
train's departure,

298
00:17:13.937 --> 00:17:17.127
allowing you to
get on in the nick of time.

299
00:17:17.567 --> 00:17:20.337
You had probably
instructed the victim to sit there

300
00:17:21.237 --> 00:17:23.897
before you killed him.

301
00:17:25.027 --> 00:17:26.397
I see.

302
00:17:26.397 --> 00:17:29.817
Mori-san's right; there was
both a phone call and a search.

303
00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:32.067
The man was distressed because
he had forgotten a contract

304
00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.277
more important than his life,

305
00:17:34.277 --> 00:17:37.237
but it never turned up.

306
00:17:37.237 --> 00:17:40.767
Wow. But how exactly is that proof?

307
00:17:40.767 --> 00:17:45.067
Was the call recorded and
voice-matched with my voice?

308
00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:46.397
Get serious!

309
00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:49.367
I was on the Yu-no-Yama
train the whole time.

310
00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:52.397
Then please show us your ticket.

311
00:17:52.397 --> 00:17:57.087
Ticket inspection took place on
the Yu-no-Yama train at around 10:40.

312
00:17:57.687 --> 00:18:01.467
If you didn't transfer,
then it should have a stamp.

313
00:18:02.357 --> 00:18:05.607
Can we see your ticket, Date-san?

314
00:18:05.607 --> 00:18:07.507
Sorry, but I lost it.

315
00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:08.927
You lost it?!

316
00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.887
Would you like to do a body search?

317
00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:15.737
Basically, there's no proof
I was on the train the entire time,

318
00:18:15.737 --> 00:18:18.357
but there's no proof
I transferred, either.

319
00:18:18.357 --> 00:18:22.397
"Innocent before proven guilty."

320
00:18:22.397 --> 00:18:23.107
Right, Detective?

321
00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:27.687
Sorry, but I can't waste
any more time here.

322
00:18:27.687 --> 00:18:28.527
I'm busy.

323
00:18:29.187 --> 00:18:31.617
Which platform for
the train to Tokyo, again?

324
00:18:32.367 --> 00:18:34.127
Mori-san...

325
00:18:36.397 --> 00:18:37.997
Dr. Date.

326
00:18:42.687 --> 00:18:43.917
Is there still something left?

327
00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:47.847
You certainly had a
lot of change in your wallet.

328
00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:53.937
So?

329
00:18:53.937 --> 00:18:57.567
It's entirely possible that
the killer took the victim's money

330
00:18:57.567 --> 00:19:01.107
from his wallet--
including all of his change--

331
00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:04.237
to make it look like a robbery.

332
00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:06.697
What's your point?

333
00:19:06.697 --> 00:19:09.157
The fingerprints.

334
00:19:09.487 --> 00:19:13.647
Sorry, but Utsumi-kun
was with me last night.

335
00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.277
We both chipped
in to buy cigarettes,

336
00:19:17.277 --> 00:19:21.817
so it wouldn't be that
odd to find his fingerprints

337
00:19:21.817 --> 00:19:24.087
on the money inside my wallet.

338
00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:26.547
He's right, Mori-san!

339
00:19:26.937 --> 00:19:28.277
No.

340
00:19:28.277 --> 00:19:31.557
I'm not referring to
the victim's fingerprints.

341
00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:32.767
What?!

342
00:19:34.237 --> 00:19:37.727
What do you mean?
Whose fingerprints would there be?

343
00:19:39.397 --> 00:19:41.237
Think back.

344
00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:42.937
Right before he was murdered,

345
00:19:42.937 --> 00:19:46.107
the victim bought canned
coffee from the onboard vendor.

346
00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:49.157
He was the last customer,
and he pulled out a 10,000-yen bill,

347
00:19:49.567 --> 00:19:51.117
so the vendor remembers him!

348
00:19:56.457 --> 00:20:00.377
Yes. That train
vendor's fingerprints.

349
00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:04.837
Dr. Date.

350
00:20:05.357 --> 00:20:08.027
The fingerprints of the vendor
on the Hana-no-Machi train,

351
00:20:08.027 --> 00:20:09.757
which you supposedly weren't on.

352
00:20:12.567 --> 00:20:17.177
If they happen to be on
any of the coins in your wallet...

353
00:20:35.647 --> 00:20:38.827
So the rumor really was true?

354
00:20:38.827 --> 00:20:41.397
Yes! It's true!

355
00:20:41.397 --> 00:20:45.147
I was receiving kickbacks!

356
00:20:45.147 --> 00:20:48.837
Then he caught me and
tried to blackmail me!

357
00:20:49.527 --> 00:20:51.397
He demanded money.

358
00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:54.237
He said if I didn't pay up,
it would become more than a rumor.

359
00:20:54.237 --> 00:20:56.067
He threatened to send
incriminating photographs

360
00:20:56.067 --> 00:20:58.987
to my medical association
and the hospital I work at!

361
00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:03.567
That's when I decided to
agree to a deal to get the film

362
00:21:03.567 --> 00:21:05.147
and kill him on the train!

363
00:21:05.737 --> 00:21:10.067
I found it hard to believe he
would hand over all the negatives!

364
00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:10.897
Plus--

365
00:21:10.897 --> 00:21:13.987
Someday the rumor would
become the target of investigation.

366
00:21:13.987 --> 00:21:19.237
So instead, you planned to
use an alibi trick involving trains

367
00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.617
to avoid suspicion.

368
00:21:22.107 --> 00:21:24.567
It was the perfect plan!

369
00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:26.747
Like all of my big operations!

370
00:21:27.737 --> 00:21:30.147
Even the most skilled
physicians are human.

371
00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:33.297
Unfortunate as it may be,
even they make bad diagnoses!

372
00:21:33.817 --> 00:21:38.767
People are imperfect-- no crime
they commit will ever be flawless!

373
00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:16.567
What a nice nap...

374
00:23:17.147 --> 00:23:19.027
Hana-no-Machi?

375
00:23:19.027 --> 00:23:20.527
Why are we still here, again?

376
00:23:21.237 --> 00:23:24.897
Since we're already here,
let's stay another night at a hot spring!

377
00:23:24.897 --> 00:23:26.987
Hana-no-Machi Hot Spring!

378
00:23:26.987 --> 00:23:28.067
Another night?!

379
00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:29.457
Sounds great! Let's do that!

380
00:23:29.987 --> 00:23:31.987
Wait a minute, Dad!

381
00:23:31.987 --> 00:23:34.567
But another night
does sound like fun!

382
00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:37.237
Hurray!

383
00:23:55.187 --> 00:23:56.237
Here we go!

384
00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:58.567
It's not much, but there's
a fresh scratch mark here

385
00:23:58.567 --> 00:23:59.907
from something thin!

386
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:05.357
I thought so!

387
00:24:05.357 --> 00:24:08.537
No question about it!
This was a murder, not an accident!

388
00:24:09.237 --> 00:24:10.737
On the next Conan--

389
00:24:10.737 --> 00:24:12.937
The Ojamanbo Murder Case.

390
00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:17.222
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:17.227
Next Conan's Hint:
Security Camera.

392
00:24:17.227 --> 00:24:19.313
Security Camera.
