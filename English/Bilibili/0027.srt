1
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:05,693
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:08,893
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:11,513
Although smaller, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:14,763
Time for another two-part episode!
Kogoro's club reunion!

5
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:18,523
Even when old friendships fall apart,
there's always only one truth!

6
00:01:55,632 --> 00:02:00,792
Kogoro's Reunion Murder Case (Part 1).

7
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:04,212
Why won't you
take us to your reunion?!

8
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:07,842
What do you mean why?
It's my reunion...

9
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:10,092
You took me to the one
five years ago, though.

10
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:12,842
But we can't
let the office close;

11
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,512
what if something big happened?

12
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:19,812
But with you on vacation, the office
would be closed no matter what.

13
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:23,172
We want to go to the hot
spring, too! Right, Conan-kun?

14
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:24,442
Yeah.

15
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:29,572
Actually, I was going to treat you
to a fancy meal instead of taking you!

16
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:32,412
Then we'll pass on the meal
and take the hot spring trip instead!

17
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,672
Don't be stupid!

18
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,092
Domestic flights are even more
expensive than international ones lately!

19
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:40,332
I don't wanna pay for three stinking people!
Put yourself in my shoes!

20
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,462
So the truth comes out.

21
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:45,092
He just robbed the bank!

22
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,762
Why you!

23
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:49,512
Wait, you two!

24
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:52,262
Stop! You're not getting away from me!

25
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,642
Damn it! Stay back or I'll shoot!

26
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:02,982
Why, you!

27
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:15,382
Amazing! You caught
a bank robber, Dad!

28
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,632
It's like taking candy from a baby

29
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,712
when the great detective
Mori Kogoro is on the case!

30
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:24,052
But...

31
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:27,422
Boy! How did you
make that brick do that?

32
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,762
Yikes!

33
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:32,422
I thought he was going to shoot
you so I kicked it without thinking

34
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:35,142
and it just happened
to hit the robber's gun...

35
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:39,382
So you saved his life?

36
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:40,852
I guess so...

37
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:44,382
Then you're obligated
to take the person

38
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:48,092
who saved your
life to the hot spring!

39
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:51,192
And I'll come as
Conan-kun's guardian!

40
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,882
This has nothing to do with that!

41
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:56,322
Mori-kun!

42
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:59,032
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:00,632
Yumi!

44
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,302
What are you doing here?

45
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:06,012
My company's right nearby.
I came to have lunch.

46
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,252
You're Horikoshi-san, right?

47
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,852
Oh? Is that you, Ran-chan?!

48
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:11,472
It is!

49
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:13,132
It's been so long!

50
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:15,432
Are you coming to the reunion
at the hot spring again?

51
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,592
Of course I am!

52
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,262
Hey! Who said--

53
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,472
I can't wait to see you there!

54
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:23,102
Wait, Yumi! Ran's not-

55
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,652
I can't believe you guys!

56
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:31,802
Excellent work,
Mori Kogoro-dono!

57
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:34,052
Thank you for your assistance!

58
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,952
This was nothing at all!

59
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:43,422
Hey, you're not going to take
the gun the robber had?

60
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:45,662
Oh, yeah. Over here.

61
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:52,882
That's strange. I'm almost certain
that his gun landed over here...

62
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:54,342
It's gone?!

63
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,722
Don't tell me someone
on this street ran off with it

64
00:04:57,722 --> 00:04:59,472
during all the commotion!

65
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:01,382
Eh?! This is bad!

66
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:03,432
We need to tell HQ
and get it back now!

67
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:05,222
What the heck?!

68
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,512
We only looked away for a second!

69
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,792
Who could've taken it?!

70
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:22,662
Eating while on a trip
is the best thing ever!

71
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:23,842
Yeah!

72
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:27,622
Why do I have to take
that little brat to the reunion?

73
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:32,542
What's the problem? You took
me to the one five years ago.

74
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:38,422
You were little at the time,
so I couldn't leave you at home alone.

75
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,172
You wouldn't be able
to attend this reunion

76
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:44,012
if Conan-kun hadn't
saved your life, you know!

77
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,942
I could've caught that guy
easy enough without the kid's help!

78
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:54,732
Say, did they ever find
that missing gun?

79
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:58,722
Yeah, what's the deal?
The police haven't announced anything...

80
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:02,922
Apparently the police
are investigating really hard,

81
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:05,512
but it hasn't been used
in any other crimes

82
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,842
and they don't seem
to have any leads, either.

83
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:11,842
The gun was a
Smith and Wesson M439.

84
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:15,052
That robber doesn't know
much about guns.

85
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:16,922
He paid a lot of money for it,

86
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:20,052
but he didn't know the difference
between a real gun and a model.

87
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,472
I hope it's just a model gun...

88
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:27,352
No, the gun didn't
break when I hit it!

89
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:32,842
So if he actually
did pay money for it,

90
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,612
it was probably the real thing!

91
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:41,032
Hot Spring Resort - Benkei

92
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,592
It sure is good
to see you all again.

93
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,762
Agreed!

94
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,972
It's the first time since our
last reunion five years ago...

95
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:11,892
...that everyone from the Beika
University Judo Club has been together.

96
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:16,112
This sure brings back memories
of all those days of intense practice...

97
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:20,322
Who're you to talk?
You rarely ever came to practice!

98
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:23,302
That's right!
You constantly ditched practice

99
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:27,472
because you thought geniuses
didn't need to train! Right, Mori-kun?

100
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:31,542
In the end, you were the only
one who never won a single match.

101
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:33,842
But that was because-

102
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:34,902
I knew it.

103
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,672
Ran!

104
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,422
You were lying whenever you
boasted that you were invincible

105
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,512
during your college days,
weren't you, Dad?

106
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:44,012
Hey, Ran-chan!
It's good to see you again!

107
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:48,142
I ran into her earlier today...
She really has grown up!

108
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,382
Thanks!

109
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:53,132
Where've you been this entire time?!

110
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,422
The open-air bath.

111
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,762
The open-air bath?!

112
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:58,152
That's a mixed-gender bath!

113
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:00,822
It's alright, there was nobody there.

114
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:02,492
Right, Conan-kun?

115
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:04,282
Yeah...

116
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:08,422
You mean you two took a bath together?!

117
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:09,342
Yeah!

118
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:12,752
It was hard to get Conan-kun to go,
he was so embarrassed!

119
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:18,302
But that sure was fun,
scrubbing each other's back!

120
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:19,842
A nosebleed?

121
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,712
The bath must've rushed
the blood to your head.

122
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:25,552
You sure he's not overexcited
from seeing you naked?

123
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:29,512
Of course he's not!
He's still a kid, you know!

124
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:33,732
I am so dead if she
finds out who I really am!

125
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:37,722
Oh, so this is the boy
Mori-kun is taking care of!

126
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,342
What a cute kid!

127
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,612
It's nice to meet you...

128
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:45,222
I'm Beika University's
judo ace, Ayashiro!

129
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,572
Nice to meetcha, kid!

130
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,672
I'm Omura Jun, our judo club's
biggest risk-taker.

131
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:53,042
I was our so-called
"point-getter"!

132
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:57,502
I'm Horikoshi Yumi, the beautiful
manager of the judo club!

133
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,422
My name used to be Kimoto Noriko,

134
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:02,842
and I also was the manager
and idol of the judo club!

135
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,972
Now I'm this man's wife!

136
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:10,262
I'm Nakamichi Kazushi; I was
captain and central pillar of the team!

137
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:12,432
I'm a police detective
in Chiba prefecture!

138
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:17,052
Of course, unlike this guy,
I haven't quit my job halfway through.

139
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:17,892
That's enough!

140
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:24,232
Every one of them
is a judo ace or idol...

141
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:31,262
And, as you all know, I'm Beika's
greatest judo master and detective-

142
00:09:31,262 --> 00:09:32,202
What's that?

143
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:35,092
Is that our old college album?

144
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,582
Yeah! I brought it
so we could all look at it!

145
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,882
Hey, now!
Can't you hear people out?!

146
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,412
May I see?

147
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,012
Sure, go right ahead!

148
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:51,012
Oh, this is from when we won
2nd place at the city tournament!

149
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,012
Yeah, I remember that!

150
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,512
We're all so young!

151
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,432
Now that I think about it,

152
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:01,402
Nakamichi and Yumi
were an item back then, huh?

153
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:06,052
Yup. We cried together
back then, didn't we, Omura?

154
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:06,782
Oh?

155
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:11,162
You were definitely
the judo club's Madonna!

156
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:15,262
That's enough.
You're my husband now!

157
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,162
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:19,422
So, are the two of you still-

159
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:23,132
Don't be silly! I dumped
this clod a long time ago!

160
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,172
And besides, he's already
chosen someone to marry...

161
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:27,802
Oh?

162
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:28,762
Hey, now...

163
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,472
You're getting married,
Nakamichi-kun?!

164
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:32,722
For reals?!

165
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:37,172
Yeah, well I had hoped to
formally announce it to you guys,

166
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:38,982
but the ceremony's going to
be sometime this year!

167
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:40,352
So who is she?!

168
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,722
My boss's daughter...

169
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,172
We met six months ago.

170
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,152
I'll introduce her
to you guys sometime!

171
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:52,592
Conversely, the former Madonna
is still a single woman...

172
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:57,042
On top of that, I might lose my
job because of the bad economy...

173
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:59,992
I really wish I were dead...

174
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:06,672
Just kidding! I just wanted
to see how you would react!

175
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:09,512
Don't scare us like that, Yumi!

176
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:15,802
But that means me and Omura-kun
are the only unmarried ones left.

177
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:18,552
Maybe we should get married!

178
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,522
B-But...

179
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:23,942
You're so stupid! It was a joke!
Don't take it seriously!

180
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:32,972
Oh? Isn't this picture from when
we came here five years ago?

181
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,032
Look! I'm in the picture too!

182
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:36,552
Oh yeah!

183
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:39,172
We took this picture
in the ping-pong room!

184
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,502
I stuck this photo in here too!

185
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:44,722
Oh yeah! What do you say
we play some ping-pong now?

186
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:45,712
That sounds great!

187
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,172
Let's play!

188
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:51,132
But we're supposed to watch
the fireworks in the evening!

189
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:54,472
Don't worry.
The fireworks start at 6:30.

190
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,092
We still have over three hours!

191
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,012
If we end before 6:00,
we'll make it in time.

192
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:00,522
I'll pass.

193
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:03,812
I'm tired for some reason.
I'll be resting in my room.

194
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:06,172
She's still the same as ever...

195
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,512
She does everything
at her own pace...

196
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:11,732
She just doesn't want
people pulling her down.

197
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:14,262
Anyway,
let's play some ping-pong!

198
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:17,092
Hot springs and ping-pong
go perfect together!

199
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,472
I haven't been this raring
to go for a long time!

200
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,672
As a gym instructor, I can't
afford to lose to the lot of you!

201
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,662
Ping-Pong Room

202
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,132
Yes! Get ready for another!

203
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:32,572
Bring it on!

204
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:33,282
Where are you going?

205
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:34,262
To the bathroom.

206
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,882
You're up next, so hurry on back.

207
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,012
Got it.

208
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,512
Say...

209
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:43,772
Didn't you win an individual award
at a national championship before?

210
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:47,192
Yeah, only once,
when I was a junior in college.

211
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:52,052
So you must've been the
best member of the club, huh?

212
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:55,172
No, there was a guy
who was much better than me.

213
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:58,802
I never beat him even once.

214
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,452
You had someone
that good in your club?

215
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:04,372
You know him too, Ran-chan.
He's even staying at this inn.

216
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,582
Who is he?!

217
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,792
Curveballs aren't fair!

218
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,572
He's--

219
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:18,222
What happened?
That was pretty fast...

220
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:19,762
No, nothing...

221
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,502
Here you go, Yukio-san!

222
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:37,152
Heads up, Noriko.

223
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:38,942
You're so silly!

224
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:42,752
Come on, how long are you
two going to play so stupidly like this?

225
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,712
Hey, isn't it time?

226
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,632
Ack! It's already past 6:00!

227
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:53,602
Oh no! We have to hurry!
The place'll be crowded!

228
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:55,142
Ok, let's hurry!

229
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:00,652
I'll return the rackets and stuff;
you go find us a spot.

230
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:02,322
Got it!

231
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:07,692
We forgot to wake up Yumi-san!

232
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:10,652
Forget about her.
It's about to start!

233
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:12,772
I'm sure someone's woken her up.

234
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:14,442
But what if we all forgot?

235
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,972
I'll go make sure!

236
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,362
Me too!

237
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,232
Hey, wait!

238
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,042
Ugh. They really
should've left her alone...

239
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:32,192
Oh no! It started!

240
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,692
We have to wake her up right away!

241
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,652
Room 201. This is her room.

242
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,192
Yumi-san?

243
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,522
Yumi-san.

244
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,862
The fireworks have started already!

245
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,732
I'm coming in, Yumi-san...

246
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:01,232
Oh? What are you two doing here?

247
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,572
Nakamichi-san!

248
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,772
Didn't you go on ahead?

249
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,212
We came to wake up Yumi-san...

250
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,822
You'd better not.

251
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,802
She gets real grouchy
whenever somebody wakes her up.

252
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:15,222
What are you doing here,
Nakamichi-san?

253
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:18,072
I worked up a sweat playing
ping-pong, so I took a quick bath.

254
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,772
That's when I heard you two running...

255
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:26,062
I thought it was strange, since we're
the only ones staying at this inn.

256
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:29,402
What are you still doing here?!

257
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,862
I could ask you the same thing...

258
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:35,372
Oh, so you were
washing off your sweat too?

259
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,872
Yup. But I was in
the public bath unlike you.

260
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,862
But Ran-chan! It was definitely
best that you didn't wake Yumi up!

261
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:46,232
She's really grouchy
when she wakes up!

262
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:46,882
I see...

263
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:51,402
She'll still be mad
we didn't wake her up, though.

264
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:52,802
Of course she will!

265
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,972
It sure is crowded!
Don't let go of my hand, Conan-kun!

266
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:04,192
Hey, Ran! Over here!

267
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:06,942
Is it just you two?

268
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:09,692
Huh? Everyone was just with us...

269
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:12,402
They got separated
from us in the crowd.

270
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,612
In that case,
I'll look around for them.

271
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:17,652
Wait, Omura!

272
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:20,652
He seems like a restless
kind of guy, huh?

273
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,322
Yeah...

274
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,542
I can't believe you guys!

275
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,692
Me and Omura went through
the trouble to find a spot,

276
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,362
but not a single one of you came!

277
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:30,592
Sorry about that!

278
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:33,772
And Omura went to look
for you but never came back,

279
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,442
as is often the case...

280
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:38,482
Sorry, I forgot where our spot was...

281
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,312
Have some sake and forget about it!

282
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,732
You guys do things
your own way far too much!

283
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:46,272
Hey, Yumi-san's still not up?

284
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,232
Oh? Yeah, now that you mention it...

285
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,072
She should be awake by now...

286
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:56,482
She must be pouting because
she missed the fireworks...

287
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,982
Damn it! You're all the same!

288
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:00,492
Looks like we
have no other choice.

289
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:05,042
What do you say we all go and
wake up the judo club's Madonna?

290
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,232
Yeah, let's go!

291
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:10,482
There's nothing to fear if we wake
up the carefree woman together, eh?

292
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,012
Careful now,
don't say that in front of Yumi!

293
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:17,362
Hey, Yumi! It's dinnertime!

294
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:19,022
Yumi!

295
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,012
That's odd...

296
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:23,472
Hey, are you still asleep?
I'm turning the light on...

297
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:39,202
Yumi!

298
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,162
Don't touch her!

299
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:44,522
Nobody but me and Mori are to
come in here, since we're detectives!

300
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,082
Ran-kun!
Call the police immediately!

301
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:48,342
Hurry!

302
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,252
Right!

303
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,322
Yumi!

304
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,172
She's dead.

305
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,632
A bullet hole in her temple...

306
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,342
A gun in her right hand...

307
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:06,562
Hey! Isn't that the gun
the bank robber had!

308
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:07,932
What?!

309
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:11,902
The gun is a Smith
and Wesson M439!

310
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:15,442
And the barrel looks like
it's been struck by something!

311
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:19,032
What's more,
Yumi was at the scene...

312
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,742
What are you doing here?

313
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:23,402
Yumi!

314
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,072
What are you doing here?

315
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:28,712
My company's right nearby.
I came to have lunch.

316
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:34,422
So Yumi picked up the gun because
she had intended to use it from the start...

317
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:39,572
Which means she had planned
to commit suicide at our reunion...

318
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:40,702
No way!

319
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,072
Why?

320
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:44,482
No, it's too early
to make any conclusions!

321
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,182
Let's wait until
the police get here.

322
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:48,602
Yeah, good call...

323
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:53,522
Why, Yumi?
Why did you have to die?!

324
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:10,792
What? Two hours
until the police get here?!

325
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,022
Yeah.

326
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:15,502
They said the streets are crowded
because of the festival today.

327
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,442
Damn it!
We can't wait two hours!

328
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:21,322
We have no choice!
We'll have to do the autopsy ourselves!

329
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,112
Yeah.

330
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,472
Does anyone have a camera?

331
00:19:24,472 --> 00:19:26,142
I brought one...

332
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:27,612
Let us borrow it!

333
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,312
I'll go get it from my room.

334
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:33,942
Who would've thought we
would be giving Yumi an autopsy...

335
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,272
Yeah...

336
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:43,192
All finished here, Mori.

337
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,572
Alright.

338
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,982
Her toes are beginning
to stiffen too...

339
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,692
Quite a bit of time
has passed since she died...

340
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,982
What do you say we check
for death spots as well?

341
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:57,772
Good idea.

342
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:01,132
But given the amount of blood
that she's lost, she might not have any...

343
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:05,112
Hey, she's not wearing
anything underneath!

344
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:06,482
What's the deal?!

345
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,692
You've got me...

346
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:10,692
That's not all that's strange.

347
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,942
Look, she's wearing a large yukata.

348
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,562
She was wearing a small one
when she was in the lobby.

349
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:19,772
And the index finger of the
hand that's holding the gun

350
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:22,032
isn't on the trigger!

351
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:25,192
But the strangest thing
is that this bullet wound-

352
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:29,362
Why, you little--!

353
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,502
You're always getting in
the way of my investigations!

354
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:33,502
Lousy kid!

355
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,542
Did you find anything out, Dad?

356
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:38,572
Judging from the state
of her rigor mortis,

357
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,512
Yumi died over seven hours ago.

358
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:45,612
Seven hours ago...
Which means around 3:00 PM?

359
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,972
That's when we were in the
ping-pong room, after she left us.

360
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:52,942
Yeah. Most likely
she returned to her room

361
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:55,982
and shot herself in the head
with a gun she had hidden.

362
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,522
Then there's no question
it was a suicide...

363
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,692
But why would she kill herself?!

364
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:04,152
Come to think of it,
she did say something...

365
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:07,612
I really wish I were dead...

366
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:10,332
She really must've
been thinking about it!

367
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,232
And then she did it...

368
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,692
Just my imagination

369
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:48,732
Playing with threads around my finger
while drinking lukewarm tea

370
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:57,752
Let's walk lightly
to the bossa nova rhythm

371
00:21:57,752 --> 00:22:02,862
The puzzle pieces are in my hands

372
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:09,152
That's right...

373
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:19,442
I was in the same place last week
but with different clothes

374
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:25,862
Step by step,
there's no reason to be anxious

375
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:32,772
Case by case,
I don't care if you laugh

376
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:43,652
Beyond the countless days,
she's waiting for me

377
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:45,592
I gotta go my own way

378
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:50,652
Say, how did Yumi-san
shoot herself in the head?

379
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,272
What are you talking about,
Conan-kun?!

380
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:53,482
Don't ask strange questions!

381
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:54,182
How?!

382
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:56,152
Isn't it obvious?

383
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:59,322
She put the gun
up to her head like so and--

384
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:04,362
Wait! Mori! What is it?!

385
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:06,982
Mori!

386
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,232
Tell me, Nakamichi.

387
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:10,192
Normally when someone
commits suicide with a gun,

388
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:12,862
they stick the barrel
against their head, right?

389
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:13,572
Yes...

390
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:17,192
Then her bullet wound
is missing something vital.

391
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:23,042
You're right! Burn marks!

392
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,822
Yes.

393
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:29,772
When you shoot a gun, a stream
of hot air accompanies the bullet!

394
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,022
If you shoot with
the gun against your head,

395
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:34,512
it would have to leave
burn marks behind!

396
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,772
The fact that there are
none here means...

397
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:39,932
...that someone else shot her?!

398
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:45,072
Someone shot her and then
tried to make it look like a suicide!

399
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,902
Someone in this inn.

400
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:17,362
Tell me! What are you hiding?!

401
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:19,472
I saw her!

402
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:21,472
Saw who? The killer?!

403
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:26,102
I saw the supposedly-dead Yumi
in a window upstairs!

404
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:31,232
I'm going to catch
whoever killed her!

405
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,702
I've finally figured out
the trick the killer used!

406
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:36,912
You were the one who killed Yumi!

407
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:40,982
On the next Conan--

408
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:44,872
Kogoro's Reunion Murder Case (Part 2).

409
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:03,152
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:04,572
"Benkei."
