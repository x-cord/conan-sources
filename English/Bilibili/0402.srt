1
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.440
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.240
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.940
When The Youth Detective Squad combines its strength,

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.640
they could solve the trick of teleportation.

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.540
Find the brooch and let Tagaki's love begin.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.525
After school, on the way home,

10
00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:01.425
we saw Officer Takagi walking into a jewelry store.

11
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.625
We followed him and went inside the jewelry store out of curiosity.

12
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.925
Surprisingly, we bumped into a jewel robber inside the store!

13
00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:14.325
Officer Takagi and we chased the robber.

14
00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:16.925
But he jumped off the roof of a building and died!

15
00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:21.625
Do you know him?

16
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:25.625
Yes. The robber fell on the moving truck,

17
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:31.125
which was carrying the stuff of Mr. Nekota, the man over there.

18
00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.625
Have you met these officers before?

19
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.925
No. Why would I have?

20
00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:39.925
I've never done anything bad before!

21
00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:45.425
Below that office is his living space.

22
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:48.425
That office is four stories above which is the ninth floor.

23
00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:50.025
So this house is on the fifth floor.

24
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.225
-What is this? -It's a strange helmet, isn't it?

25
00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:55.225
Hey!

26
00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:57.325
Is that for a sports bicycle?

27
00:02:57.325 --> 00:03:01.525
Yes, I was into triathlon when I was young.

28
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.125
Where is the bedroom?

29
00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:08.725
I found it!

30
00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:11.525
It's here!

31
00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.325
If my deduction is correct...

32
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:16.425
Then, probably...

33
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:21.125
It's wet!

34
00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:24.325
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

35
00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.625
Mr. Atomura was murdered by Mr. Nekota,

36
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.525
who disguised the murder as a suicide.

37
00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:38.625
With the time lag and the gap between the buildings.

38
00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:45.925
"A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 2)"

39
00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:48.725
Anyhow...

40
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:50.725
It's a concrete fact that Takagi bumped into this robber

41
00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:52.825
in the jewelry store and chased him.

42
00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.525
Chased him up to the roof of the building.

43
00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:56.525
But Takagi just let him jump off the building

44
00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:59.225
and die right in front of him.

45
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.725
It's a hard fact.

46
00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:04.425
Right. It seems more than just a coincidence though.

47
00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:07.125
The robber crashed onto a moving truck

48
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:10.225
which was helping the office transfer of the company

49
00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:12.625
that he used to work for but was fired recently.

50
00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.925
Yet, it seems there's no doubt about that suicide.

51
00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:22.825
Then, I guess that's it for today.

52
00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.225
Sorry, Mr. Nekota,

53
00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:27.525
we need you to come down to the station later.

54
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:29.725
What? Why do I need to?

55
00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:32.625
Well, we need to ask you some questions

56
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:34.525
because you were Mr. Atomura's former boss.

57
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.125
Things like what kind of person he was or whether he had financial problems

58
00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.325
and all that.

59
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:42.325
"Sakanobu Nekota (51)" -Okay, I understand.

60
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:46.025
Down a little! Down...

61
00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:47.625
Just a little more!

62
00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.325
It's cold!

63
00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:54.125
Guys, what are you doing?

64
00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:55.525
Nothing!

65
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.925
By the way, I have questions.

66
00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:00.925
Questions?

67
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:01.925
Right.

68
00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:04.225
A couple of questions for Mr. Nekota.

69
00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:08.925
For me?

70
00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:26.025
I remember what you said to Officer Takagi

71
00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.325
when you first came to the scene of the suicide.

72
00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:32.925
You said, "Call your friends and do what you have to do. Just be quick!"

73
00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.325
Right.

74
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:36.725
I'm wondering why you said that.

75
00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:39.425
Well, you know, I got a schedule.

76
00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:40.625
We're not talking about that!

77
00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:43.725
We're asking, how did you know that this

78
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:47.425
Mr. Ordinary with the boring polo-shirt,

79
00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:50.025
was actually...

80
00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.525
was actually a police officer?

81
00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:54.025
That's what the question means!

82
00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:03.225
Yeah, I mean, why not?

83
00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:05.225
A person died, right?

84
00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.225
Isn't it natural to think that the police are here?

85
00:06:08.225 --> 00:06:10.525
Yeah, but remember what you actually said?

86
00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:13.325
You asked, "What's going on?"

87
00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:18.225
And you also said that you never met Officer Takagi before!

88
00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:20.425
I see.

89
00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.625
You didn't know about the situation,

90
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.225
and neither ever met Takagi before.

91
00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:27.025
It's something that you knew that he is a police officer.

92
00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:30.425
That was probably the atmosphere that made me think so!

93
00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:32.825
You know, something bad happened,

94
00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:36.425
so I just felt the police were here.

95
00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:39.425
Fair enough, next question then!

96
00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:43.125
It's been a while since we got here.

97
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:46.725
But why are you not getting mad at us?

98
00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:54.525
We're kids, you know?

99
00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:57.725
You might have thought that we're officers if we're adults.

100
00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:00.625
But we're kid and you just let us in without saying anything to us.

101
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:02.725
A normal person would say,

102
00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:06.925
"Who the heck are those kids?"

103
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:08.425
Oh, that...

104
00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:10.925
You didn't say anything,

105
00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:14.025
because you knew us, right?

106
00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:19.225
You knew that we were important witnesses of the jewel robbery.

107
00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:27.125
Is that true?

108
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.625
-No. -Wait a minute.

109
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.525
You knew that I was a police officer.

110
00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:34.525
And you also knew that these kids were involved in the robbery.

111
00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:37.825
It can't be!

112
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:40.525
"Put the jewels in this bag!" -The jewel robber!

113
00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:42.725
It was you, wasn't it?

114
00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:44.325
It's possible.

115
00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:46.025
If that is true,

116
00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:49.225
then it will answer Mitsuhiko's questions.

117
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:50.625
Oh, please!

118
00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.725
Don't you remember?

119
00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:56.425
The robber jumped off the building opposite here

120
00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:59.025
and crashed onto the moving truck!

121
00:07:59.025 --> 00:08:01.325
Let's say I was the robber.

122
00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:05.525
Then where did I go, after jumping off the building?

123
00:08:05.525 --> 00:08:10.225
Isn't it Atomura who fell on the truck?

124
00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:14.525
Also, I'm already 51 years old.

125
00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:16.825
Do you think I have the body to pull away from a police officer

126
00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:19.625
and run up to the roof of a building?

127
00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:23.525
Triathlon!

128
00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:24.625
What?

129
00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:30.025
If you're still into that iron man race,

130
00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:31.825
then that's probably nothing to you, right?

131
00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:36.425
Is that you, Conan?

132
00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:39.325
I was wondering where you were.

133
00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:42.225
Now, where are you, Conan?

134
00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:44.225
I'm in the building opposite!

135
00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:46.025
The robber jumped off, right?

136
00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:49.425
Now I'm going up the stairs to the roof where the robber jumped off!

137
00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.225
There's something I wanted to try.

138
00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:53.925
So I told them to throw the questions until I'm ready!

139
00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:56.225
What is it, then?

140
00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:08.725
Can you see me from there?

141
00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:16.225
Yeah, I can see you.

142
00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:18.325
But what are you exactly trying to do?

143
00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:20.225
Hey, don't you remember?

144
00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:24.525
I mean, about what the lady living right above that house said.

145
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:25.525
She woke up in 2 am midnight

146
00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:28.325
because she heard a noise from the window.

147
00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:30.825
As she looked at the window,

148
00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:36.425
there was a shadow of a thin long stick on the curtain.

149
00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:38.325
I think I got the mystery behind it,

150
00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:40.725
and now I'm going to show that to you all!

151
00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:42.225
Conan?

152
00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:43.725
Okay, that's enough!

153
00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:46.325
I'm helping you guys because it's my former staff

154
00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:48.525
who robbed and killed himself!

155
00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:52.225
It looks like these kids really want me to be the robber.

156
00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.225
But it's only kid's shallow cleverness after all.

157
00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:56.925
I can't believe you're actually listening to them!

158
00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:00.225
Again, like I said,

159
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.625
if I was the robber,

160
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.525
then how did I vanish after jumping off the building?

161
00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:07.625
It's impossible! There's no way I could've done it!

162
00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:09.125
Unless I have supernatural powers

163
00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.425
to use teleportation or something!

164
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:14.925
Yes, you can.

165
00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:15.925
What?

166
00:10:27.425 --> 00:10:30.925
You can do it without supernatural power.

167
00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:32.425
Just like that!

168
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:33.725
Conan?

169
00:10:34.825 --> 00:10:37.325
How did you get here?

170
00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:38.625
I just used this rope

171
00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.525
that I borrowed from the people at moving company.

172
00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:45.025
Rope?

173
00:10:45.025 --> 00:10:46.525
First of all, you measure the length

174
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:48.625
between the balcony of old office in ninth floor

175
00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:52.325
and the balcony of this house that four floor below it.

176
00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:54.725
Next, you get a rope twice the lengths

177
00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:57.625
and put it through the handrail of the balcony in the old office.

178
00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.325
Then tie both ends to make a loop!

179
00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:03.325
After that, you connect a little loop to the rope

180
00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:05.325
so it can carry your body.

181
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:08.025
You throw the rope with the little loop from the balcony

182
00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:10.325
to the roof of the building opposite,

183
00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:12.025
then you're all set!

184
00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:13.825
All you need to do is to rob the jewelry shop

185
00:11:13.825 --> 00:11:18.825
and pretend that you are being chased up to the roof of the building.

186
00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:20.925
There, you cover the rope with the long raincoat,

187
00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:24.125
with the little loop around your waist and jump off the roof.

188
00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:35.525
This brings you straight down to this balcony.

189
00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:38.225
After which you can hid the rope away

190
00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:40.325
by untying the knot.

191
00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.525
I see.

192
00:11:45.525 --> 00:11:47.725
I'm actually surprised that you are not hurt at all.

193
00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:50.525
The impact must've been violent when you landed on the balcony.

194
00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:54.225
Just like the robber, I was wearing a helmet.

195
00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:55.725
And also right before the impact,

196
00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:58.425
I blew up a soccer ball with this ball-ejection belt Dr. Agasa invented,

197
00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:01.525
in order to absorb the impact.

198
00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:02.525
That's why I'm totally fine!

199
00:12:07.725 --> 00:12:11.225
In Mr. Nekota's case, he set the bed mattresses in the balcony,

200
00:12:11.225 --> 00:12:13.525
in order to absorb the impact.

201
00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:37.047
Mattresses?

202
00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:40.147
Yeah, they were wet when I checked them a little while ago!

203
00:12:45.647 --> 00:12:48.747
I see! Because they were exposed to the rain, right?

204
00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:52.847
Then, Mrs. Isaka saw and heard the shadow and noise that night,

205
00:12:52.847 --> 00:12:56.447
because you were rehearsing this trick.

206
00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:57.647
Wait a minute!

207
00:12:57.647 --> 00:12:59.147
There was a dead body on the moving truck

208
00:12:59.147 --> 00:13:03.547
when you guys looked down right after the robber jumped off, right?

209
00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:06.247
How would you explain this?

210
00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:09.547
He was on the moving truck from the beginning.

211
00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:15.447
The truck was parked in the back of this building

212
00:13:15.447 --> 00:13:18.447
in order to move things out of the old office above.

213
00:13:20.047 --> 00:13:21.247
Probably...

214
00:13:21.247 --> 00:13:23.747
you told Mr. Atomura to help move, or something like that.

215
00:13:38.947 --> 00:13:42.347
Then you pushed him over the window of your old office.

216
00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:46.047
Yeah, I remember you said,

217
00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:50.347
the whole ninth floor was your old office.

218
00:13:50.347 --> 00:13:51.447
So it was possible to drop him

219
00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:54.147
on the truck even if it was parked in the back alley.

220
00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:55.747
Well, what about the noise?

221
00:13:55.747 --> 00:13:57.247
Well, someone would hear the noise,

222
00:13:57.247 --> 00:14:00.447
if a person falls on the truck, right?

223
00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:03.847
No, because there is water supply work around here,

224
00:14:03.847 --> 00:14:06.347
and it doesn't end until evening everyday.

225
00:14:10.547 --> 00:14:15.047
It's likely that the the water supply work shut off the noise.

226
00:14:15.047 --> 00:14:17.047
I'm sure there was to the truck when the body fell.

227
00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:20.447
So some movers may have noticed something.

228
00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:21.647
Yes, and that's why you told everybody

229
00:14:21.647 --> 00:14:24.347
including the driver to come up to the office, right?

230
00:14:24.347 --> 00:14:27.547
Because you wanted to tell them which things go first and stuff...

231
00:14:27.547 --> 00:14:32.447
The moving people told me that they had to wait for a while in the doorway.

232
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:35.547
That was probably when you pushed Mr. Atomura over the window,

233
00:14:35.547 --> 00:14:37.447
and threw the rope to the other building.

234
00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:40.047
And then, you closed the blinds!

235
00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:44.947
So that nobody would see the trick when it came in to the office!

236
00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:48.547
I see. So, to sum it up.

237
00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:51.047
First of all, you told the movers

238
00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:52.847
including the driver to come up to the old office,

239
00:14:52.847 --> 00:14:55.447
which was on the top floor of this building.

240
00:14:55.447 --> 00:14:57.247
Then, while you kept them waiting in the doorway.

241
00:14:57.247 --> 00:14:59.447
You pushed Mr. Atomura over onto the moving truck

242
00:14:59.447 --> 00:15:01.147
which was parked in the back of this building.

243
00:15:02.247 --> 00:15:05.747
Next, you threw the rope to the roof of the opposite building.

244
00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:08.747
And then, while the movers were moving the stuff

245
00:15:08.747 --> 00:15:11.747
from the old to the new office,

246
00:15:11.747 --> 00:15:14.047
"Put the jewels in this bag!" -you robbed the jewelry store!

247
00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:18.047
Then Officer Takagi chased you up to the roof of the new office building.

248
00:15:18.047 --> 00:15:21.047
All of these were done just to make this incident look like

249
00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:22.947
the robber committed suicide

250
00:15:22.947 --> 00:15:26.347
after being chased by a police officer!

251
00:15:26.347 --> 00:15:28.147
You got that right! Also, when he jumped off,

252
00:15:28.147 --> 00:15:29.947
he dropped the bag with the jewelries

253
00:15:29.947 --> 00:15:32.447
and the spare helmet which he left on the roof beforehand.

254
00:15:32.447 --> 00:15:36.347
As these things hit the truck,

255
00:15:36.347 --> 00:15:42.547
the people would notice that something fell on the truck!

256
00:15:42.547 --> 00:15:47.047
That's probably why the helmet wasn't on Mr. Atomura's head!

257
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:49.747
So the robber smiled when I told him,

258
00:15:49.747 --> 00:15:51.847
that I was from the police.

259
00:15:54.647 --> 00:15:58.547
Because he needed someone to chase him

260
00:15:58.547 --> 00:16:03.547
and someone to witness the suicide on the roof.

261
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:06.447
Yeah. If you weren't there,

262
00:16:06.447 --> 00:16:08.447
he would've probably waited until other police officer came

263
00:16:08.447 --> 00:16:11.747
to the jewelry shop.

264
00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:16.147
Talk about a trick that is unbelievably reliant on luck.

265
00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:18.147
Until you jumped off the building,

266
00:16:18.147 --> 00:16:19.747
surprisingly no neighbors or passersby

267
00:16:19.747 --> 00:16:23.647
actually saw the rope or the dead body.

268
00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:26.347
Well, I guess it was the sloppiness of your plan that

269
00:16:26.347 --> 00:16:28.347
made it possible to solve even for kids.

270
00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:30.947
It wasn't just his luck that people went blind!

271
00:16:30.947 --> 00:16:32.347
What?

272
00:16:32.347 --> 00:16:34.047
It was because of this weather!

273
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.447
You mean the rain?

274
00:16:38.447 --> 00:16:41.447
I get it! When it's raining, people put up their umbrella

275
00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:43.147
and stay away from balcony.

276
00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:44.847
As long as people hold their umbrella,

277
00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:47.147
they won't see what's above their head.

278
00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:49.047
Likewise, as long as people stay away from balcony,

279
00:16:49.047 --> 00:16:51.847
they won't see what's below.

280
00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:55.047
Plus, the mover used the backstreet when they moved the truck

281
00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:57.947
and there were not many passersby on that street.

282
00:16:57.947 --> 00:16:59.147
Under this circumstance,

283
00:16:59.147 --> 00:17:02.947
you would have been the unluckiest person to make people see those things.

284
00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:04.047
That's true.

285
00:17:05.647 --> 00:17:07.147
Yeah, but still,

286
00:17:07.147 --> 00:17:11.347
it was a coincidence that he took action on a rainy day, right?

287
00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:13.347
It wasn't a coincidence!

288
00:17:13.347 --> 00:17:16.247
You canceled moving twice

289
00:17:16.247 --> 00:17:18.147
and postponed it to today, right?

290
00:17:20.147 --> 00:17:21.947
Now, all we need is evidence.

291
00:17:21.947 --> 00:17:24.047
That, I think is somewhere in this house

292
00:17:24.047 --> 00:17:27.247
or around this building. I'm pretty sure!

293
00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:28.447
Because Mr. Nekota showed up at the scene of the suicide

294
00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:32.047
soon after the robber jumped off.

295
00:17:32.047 --> 00:17:34.347
So it must be somewhere around here!

296
00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:37.347
The evidence includes the rope, helmet and raincoat that he used.

297
00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.147
Also the thing that he picked up

298
00:17:39.147 --> 00:17:41.447
and put in his pocket at the jewelry shop.

299
00:17:46.047 --> 00:17:49.147
And the brooch that I was going to buy.

300
00:17:50.347 --> 00:17:51.847
I see.

301
00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:55.347
Now, it's whether you hid them or dumped them.

302
00:17:55.347 --> 00:17:57.947
The helmet and raincoat are somewhere in the same place together,

303
00:17:57.947 --> 00:18:01.847
since you didn't have enough time to go far.

304
00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:04.847
We'll probably find the raincoat with that brooch,

305
00:18:04.847 --> 00:18:09.247
as well as the helmet with your fingerprints and hair on it.

306
00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:12.247
Mr. Nekota.

307
00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:16.647
I think it's time you confess.

308
00:18:31.247 --> 00:18:34.647
I don't understand why did you have to take that brooch?

309
00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:38.847
Redemption. I guess?

310
00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:40.747
Redemption?

311
00:18:40.747 --> 00:18:44.747
My company was heavily in the red.

312
00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:49.747
It was necessary to fire those who were close to their retirement age

313
00:18:49.747 --> 00:18:52.147
and those who were on a decline work-wise.

314
00:18:55.547 --> 00:18:58.147
He happened to be one of those people.

315
00:18:59.747 --> 00:19:02.647
I will spill the secret if you fire me.

316
00:19:02.647 --> 00:19:04.547
The things this company has been hiding.

317
00:19:04.547 --> 00:19:07.747
You know, about the deceptive food labeling.

318
00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:12.047
All I'm asking is for is you to let me stay here until my retirement age.

319
00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:13.347
All I need is a life in which I can afford a brooch

320
00:19:13.347 --> 00:19:17.047
like this for my wife's birthday.

321
00:19:17.047 --> 00:19:19.647
Well, my wife might ask me to buy her jewelry

322
00:19:19.647 --> 00:19:23.247
that is more expensive than this, after my retirement age.

323
00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:26.047
But for now, you don't need to worry about that, President.

324
00:19:27.147 --> 00:19:28.547
That's why you killed him.

325
00:19:28.547 --> 00:19:30.747
Yes.

326
00:19:30.747 --> 00:19:35.147
I thought I would be in a morass if I let him keep blackmailing me.

327
00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:37.947
But, why that brooch?

328
00:19:37.947 --> 00:19:42.547
I was thinking of giving it to his wife on her birthday.

329
00:19:42.547 --> 00:19:47.147
And saying it was a present that he left with me before his death.

330
00:19:48.447 --> 00:19:50.247
In fact, it's true that he'd been working very hard

331
00:19:50.247 --> 00:19:53.347
since the company was established.

332
00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:59.247
And not only have I made such person a criminal

333
00:19:59.247 --> 00:20:04.047
but also killed him, I just wanted to run away from the sense of guilt.

334
00:20:04.047 --> 00:20:06.347
So I impulsively took the brooch.

335
00:20:19.047 --> 00:20:20.747
It's ironic. The brooch was supposed to help me flee,

336
00:20:20.747 --> 00:20:23.447
but it actually helped you guys arrest me.

337
00:21:56.247 --> 00:21:59.547
All right. So where is the raincoat with that brooch?

338
00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:02.847
It's in the closet in my bedroom.

339
00:22:02.847 --> 00:22:04.447
Did you hear that, Officer Sato?

340
00:22:04.447 --> 00:22:05.647
Please go and check!

341
00:22:05.647 --> 00:22:07.147
Oh, okay.

342
00:22:12.847 --> 00:22:13.947
I found it!

343
00:22:15.047 --> 00:22:16.647
This wet one, right?

344
00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:20.847
I'm pretty sure you'll like it!

345
00:22:23.147 --> 00:22:26.547
It took at a long time for Officer Takagi to decide!

346
00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:28.847
It looks amazing even without diamonds!

347
00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:32.347
I'm surprised he has pretty good taste.

348
00:22:32.347 --> 00:22:33.847
Why don't you take a look?

349
00:22:37.447 --> 00:22:39.247
Yes.

350
00:22:39.247 --> 00:22:41.847
Officer Sato. Please take a look at it!

351
00:22:43.647 --> 00:22:45.147
That must be it!

352
00:22:45.147 --> 00:22:47.747
Trust me. Miwako was staring at this brooch.

353
00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:49.947
She wasn't even blinking at all!

354
00:22:49.947 --> 00:22:52.747
It's a perfect present for her, isn't it?

355
00:22:52.747 --> 00:22:55.647
But you didn't hear this from me, okay?

356
00:22:55.647 --> 00:22:58.647
Look, coincidence makes girls believe in destiny

357
00:22:58.647 --> 00:23:00.247
and that's where the love deepens!

358
00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.547
Let us deepen...

359
00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:06.147
Our love story.

360
00:23:06.147 --> 00:23:08.047
Oh?

361
00:23:08.047 --> 00:23:10.147
This is...

362
00:23:11.547 --> 00:23:14.647
A brooch.

363
00:23:14.647 --> 00:23:17.147
This is the brooch Yumi wanted!

364
00:23:20.447 --> 00:23:23.047
-Officer Yumi? -Yeah.

365
00:23:23.047 --> 00:23:25.547
She was all hyper when she saw this in a magazine.

366
00:23:25.547 --> 00:23:26.847
Speaking of jewelries,

367
00:23:26.847 --> 00:23:30.147
I think Yumi was wearing a bracelet that looked just like

368
00:23:30.147 --> 00:23:32.747
the one that I gave you a few days ago.

369
00:23:32.747 --> 00:23:35.347
Oh, that! I lent it to her!

370
00:23:36.447 --> 00:23:37.747
Cause she said she'd been looking

371
00:23:37.747 --> 00:23:39.447
for a bracelet just like that.

372
00:23:41.947 --> 00:23:45.647
I'm not interested in those shiny things at all.

373
00:23:47.647 --> 00:23:50.847
This necklace looks fabulous!

374
00:23:52.947 --> 00:23:54.047
All right!

375
00:23:54.047 --> 00:23:57.147
I'm gonna try Lieutenant Takano next time.

376
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.847
"Next Episode" -Hey Conan! Come over here! Right now!

377
00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:06.147
We got a client for the Youth Detective Squad!

378
00:24:06.147 --> 00:24:08.447
Just come, we got a nice one.

379
00:24:18.247 --> 00:24:19.347
Watch out!

380
00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:22.947
Guys, get off the floor...

381
00:24:24.147 --> 00:24:29.635
Next Conan, "Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 1)"

382
00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:32.174
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:32.174 --> 00:24:34.974
"Raging bull"

384
00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:36.574
Next time, I'll get what's best for her.

385
00:24:36.574 --> 00:24:37.674
What? A cow?

386
00:24:37.674 --> 00:24:38.874
It's no good?
