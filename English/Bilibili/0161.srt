1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.466
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.066
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.666
Today's setting is an unusual restaurant,

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.666
the crime arrives by water.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.266
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.266
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.566
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.104 --> 00:02:00.004
"Murder at Ryusuitei"

9
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.404
"Ryusuitei"

10
00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:13.004
Gosh. We are 30 minutes early for our reservation.

11
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.304
This is a very popular place.

12
00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:18.304
If we are late, they will cancel our reservation.

13
00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.304
I'm tired of waiting and I'm getting hungry.

14
00:02:31.804 --> 00:02:34.204
All right, Room 4's sake is ready!

15
00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:35.404
Got it!

16
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:43.804
Okay!

17
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:56.404
I see. A restaurant where the food is served by boat.

18
00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:58.004
No wonder it's popular.

19
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:00.304
Do you like it?

20
00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:03.104
There are bigger boats too.

21
00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:05.604
What happens to the boat once it gets to the room?

22
00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:07.604
The customer takes the dishes off the boat

23
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.004
then pushes a button in the room

24
00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:11.504
and it goes back automatically.

25
00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:13.404
Wow, that's neat!

26
00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:14.904
Excuse me.

27
00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:17.904
-Yes? -We have reservations.

28
00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:20.704
Mr. Kaneda, you reserved Room 8, didn't you?

29
00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:22.104
Huh?

30
00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:23.604
Hey, Kaneda.

31
00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.804
Not me. There must be a mistake.

32
00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.804
Hey, Kaneda, Arai!

33
00:03:28.804 --> 00:03:31.704
You're late. I was getting tired of waiting.

34
00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:34.504
Sorry. Kaneda was late.

35
00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:37.004
Go on, apologize.

36
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.204
This wasn't my idea.

37
00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:42.604
Come on! This is to celebrate your promotion to assistant professor,

38
00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:44.404
the Professor's treat!

39
00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:45.404
Just because we were hired the same time

40
00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:47.604
doesn't mean we're friends.

41
00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:49.804
Starting today, address me as Assistant Professor Kaneda.

42
00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:51.804
Understand?

43
00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:54.304
And you're my assistant, Arai.

44
00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:58.504
Out of my way.

45
00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.704
Hey, you. What's the most expensive dish you have?

46
00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:04.304
It's blowfish milt.

47
00:04:04.304 --> 00:04:06.404
Then bring us three of those.

48
00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:08.404
You don't mind, do you, Professor?

49
00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:10.904
No, it's fine with me.

50
00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:13.704
Tonight is your night.

51
00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:16.804
We'll have three orders of blowfish milt.

52
00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:18.604
Yes, right away.

53
00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:20.804
Let's go inside.

54
00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:29.404
Did you see that? That Kaneda's a real stinker!

55
00:04:29.404 --> 00:04:34.804
I wonder why Professor Iwama always orders so much food?

56
00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:37.404
Maybe he likes a full table.

57
00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:40.604
But he usually leaves without eating much.

58
00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:47.104
I'm dying of hunger!

59
00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:53.204
Those men are next door.

60
00:04:56.304 --> 00:04:58.204
Here it comes!

61
00:04:58.204 --> 00:05:00.104
What a huge boat!

62
00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:02.904
Look at all the food! I won't be able to...

63
00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:04.004
Huh?

64
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:06.404
Gosh, it wasn't ours.

65
00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:08.904
Professor, there sure is a lot of food, isn't there?

66
00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:10.604
It's a celebration.

67
00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:14.204
By the way, I wonder where Kaneda went off to.

68
00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:17.104
He probably went to the toilet. He'll be back soon.

69
00:05:17.104 --> 00:05:19.004
"Room 2"

70
00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:25.404
Delicious!

71
00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:30.504
Conan, how's the sashimi?

72
00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:31.504
Yes.

73
00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:33.404
Hey, where'd it go?

74
00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:37.304
I dropped my contact lens!

75
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.604
Oh no, now I've done it!

76
00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:44.804
Here. I found it! What a relief!

77
00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:48.004
For a professor, he's quite a scatterbrain.

78
00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:52.904
Boy, that was the best!

79
00:05:52.904 --> 00:05:56.504
If there were geishas here, it'd be heaven!

80
00:05:56.504 --> 00:05:57.704
Dad!

81
00:05:57.704 --> 00:06:00.604
Hey, hey. There's a child present.

82
00:06:00.604 --> 00:06:02.904
I was kidding. It's a joke.

83
00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.104
Huh?

84
00:06:14.904 --> 00:06:17.404
Hey, Ran. We're out of sake.

85
00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:19.304
Order me another.

86
00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:21.304
One bottle is enough.

87
00:06:21.304 --> 00:06:24.304
We're going to have a delicious dinner now.

88
00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:26.704
Gosh. It's not just her personality,

89
00:06:26.704 --> 00:06:29.504
now she's even beginning to sound like her mother Eri.

90
00:06:31.804 --> 00:06:33.704
What?

91
00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:40.704
Somebody come quick!

92
00:06:40.704 --> 00:06:42.204
What's going on?

93
00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:51.504
What happened?

94
00:06:51.504 --> 00:06:53.104
The customer is...

95
00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:00.904
That's...

96
00:07:00.904 --> 00:07:02.604
Ka... Kaneda!

97
00:07:09.104 --> 00:07:10.904
He's dead.

98
00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:14.604
This is a murder.

99
00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:17.104
Notify the police immediately.

100
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.204
Yes!

101
00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:23.304
Professor Iwama, what happened?

102
00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:26.904
Kaneda is dead in this room!

103
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.504
What?

104
00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:31.504
Listen! A murder has just taken place!

105
00:07:31.504 --> 00:07:32.804
Until the police arrive,

106
00:07:32.804 --> 00:07:35.504
I want everyone to wait in their rooms!

107
00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:39.004
The police will probably want to question everyone.

108
00:07:39.004 --> 00:07:41.004
Your cooperation will be appreciated.

109
00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:48.604
Since he fell at this angle,

110
00:07:48.604 --> 00:07:50.204
I guess Mr. Kaneda, who was sitting at the far end of the table,

111
00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:52.504
greeted the killer

112
00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:55.104
and was stabbed in the chest while facing him.

113
00:07:55.104 --> 00:07:57.904
Then he fell onto the table.

114
00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:08.604
If the killer came here by the waterway,

115
00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:11.304
this room should be sopping wet

116
00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:13.004
but it's not.

117
00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:20.304
What is this black thing on his thumb?

118
00:08:23.104 --> 00:08:24.404
This smell is...

119
00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.804
How many times do I have to tell you

120
00:08:27.804 --> 00:08:29.904
not to wander around the crime scene!

121
00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:36.604
The victim is Keizo Kaneda,

122
00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:39.904
assistant professor of science at Jomon University, 29 years of age.

123
00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:43.204
He was stabbed in the heart with a dagger and died instantly.

124
00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:47.204
Time of death is estimated to be at about 19:50.

125
00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:51.604
Also, we have confirmed the alibis of all the restaurant employees.

126
00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:55.204
This is Professor Iwama and Mr. Arai is an instructor,

127
00:08:55.204 --> 00:08:57.904
both men work with the victim at the university.

128
00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:01.004
We were celebrating Kaneda's promotion

129
00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:03.004
to assistant professor tonight.

130
00:09:03.004 --> 00:09:06.404
I thought he was in the toilet.

131
00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:08.904
Who would've thought something like this was possible?

132
00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:12.004
And a certain party just happened to be on the scene.

133
00:09:12.004 --> 00:09:15.304
Yes! The famous private detective Kogoro Mouri here!

134
00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:16.704
Inspector Megure!

135
00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:21.904
And Kyoko Anzai, you were the first to discover the body.

136
00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:24.104
Yes. The customer went into the room

137
00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:25.704
but never placed an order,

138
00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:28.804
so I went in to check on him. That's how I found him.

139
00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:32.404
But why was he in Room 8?

140
00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:36.404
Didnt he say he didn't make that reservation?

141
00:09:36.404 --> 00:09:39.204
That's why I called out to him

142
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.604
when he started to head for that room.

143
00:09:40.604 --> 00:09:44.004
But he said he was meeting someone there.

144
00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:49.404
So he was meeting someone secretly.

145
00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:52.504
That person must have killed him.

146
00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:56.904
Did you see anyone besides the victim enter the room?

147
00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:58.404
No, no one.

148
00:09:58.404 --> 00:10:00.304
You're positive?

149
00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:02.104
Yes. I was standing at the register

150
00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:04.304
and looking out at the garden.

151
00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.004
The front door is the only way to get in

152
00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:09.004
and everyone has to cross the bridge to get to their rooms.

153
00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:13.204
Then how did the killer get into the room?

154
00:10:13.204 --> 00:10:15.704
Inspector, from the waterway.

155
00:10:15.704 --> 00:10:19.004
It was designed to go past each room,

156
00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:22.404
so you can get to the room by using it.

157
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:26.604
I see. So you're saying this is an inside job.

158
00:10:26.604 --> 00:10:28.404
All right, Takagi.

159
00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:33.304
Ask all the customers if they saw someone using the waterway.

160
00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:34.304
Yes, sir!

161
00:10:34.604 --> 00:10:36.504
"Room 4"

162
00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:38.804
We were looking at the waterway a lot

163
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.204
but we didn't see anyone on it.

164
00:10:41.204 --> 00:10:42.604
"Room 5"

165
00:10:42.604 --> 00:10:44.804
No, no one like that.

166
00:10:44.804 --> 00:10:46.604
I didn't see anyone either.

167
00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.204
"Room 6"

168
00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:51.504
-No idea. -No one went by.

169
00:10:51.504 --> 00:10:53.104
"Room 7"

170
00:10:53.104 --> 00:10:56.604
If someone was walking in the water, we'd notice.

171
00:10:56.604 --> 00:10:58.704
Only boats went by.

172
00:10:59.404 --> 00:11:01.304
No one saw anything?

173
00:11:01.304 --> 00:11:05.404
No. All the other rooms were parties of four or more

174
00:11:05.404 --> 00:11:07.804
but no one saw anything other than boats go past.

175
00:11:07.804 --> 00:11:09.904
Maybe the killer went underwater?

176
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:12.804
No. The water's only about 50 centimeters deep,

177
00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.404
it's not possible to swim underwater.

178
00:11:14.404 --> 00:11:16.404
Besides, if the killer went underwater,

179
00:11:16.404 --> 00:11:19.304
the room would be sopping wet.

180
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.304
Did you say something?

181
00:11:21.304 --> 00:11:23.904
No, I was talking to myself.

182
00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:27.304
Either way, since coming in from the outside is impossible,

183
00:11:27.304 --> 00:11:29.304
it must be an inside job.

184
00:11:29.304 --> 00:11:32.204
We've got to confirm everyone's alibi.

185
00:11:32.204 --> 00:11:36.104
Mr. Iwama, where were you at about 7:50?

186
00:11:36.104 --> 00:11:39.004
I never left our room, Room 3.

187
00:11:39.004 --> 00:11:44.104
Isn't that about the time you were shouting?

188
00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:46.004
Yes, that's right.

189
00:11:46.004 --> 00:11:47.604
While I was looking for my contact lens,

190
00:11:47.604 --> 00:11:49.904
I knocked some dishes over.

191
00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:53.704
After that, I saw the screen close in your room,

192
00:11:53.704 --> 00:11:56.304
so your alibi is okay.

193
00:11:56.304 --> 00:12:01.404
Mr. Arai, you came back to the restaurant after the murder.

194
00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:03.404
After Kaneda left,

195
00:12:03.404 --> 00:12:06.204
the professor asked me to buy him a pack of cigarettes

196
00:12:06.204 --> 00:12:08.704
so I went to the convenience store.

197
00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:12.704
I told him where to go.

198
00:12:12.704 --> 00:12:16.104
We didn't have the brand he wanted at our register.

199
00:12:16.104 --> 00:12:18.704
It took me about 10 minutes to walk there.

200
00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.404
I have a receipt.

201
00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:26.404
The time on the receipt is 19:52.

202
00:12:26.404 --> 00:12:30.204
Which means these two men have perfect alibis.

203
00:12:30.204 --> 00:12:33.804
The killer must be one of the other customers.

204
00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:39.704
No. With the other parties of four or more,

205
00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:40.904
the killer would have to fool the others

206
00:12:40.904 --> 00:12:43.504
as well as Mr. Anzai to get to that room, so it's impossible.

207
00:12:44.304 --> 00:12:48.204
These two are the only ones who were able to be alone

208
00:12:48.204 --> 00:12:50.404
and commit the crime.

209
00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:54.404
Takagi. Let's split up and verify the other customers' alibis.

210
00:12:54.404 --> 00:12:56.104
Yes, sir!

211
00:12:56.104 --> 00:12:58.304
Madam, I want to see the boats.

212
00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.704
Not now, Conan. It's a bad time.

213
00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:03.804
It's all right. I have nothing to do now.

214
00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:05.204
Thank you so much.

215
00:13:17.104 --> 00:13:18.504
See, this is it.

216
00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:21.004
Is the door always locked?

217
00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:22.304
Yes, that's right.

218
00:13:22.304 --> 00:13:24.704
We don't want just anyone going in and out of here.

219
00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:27.904
I'm the only employee with a key.

220
00:13:29.104 --> 00:13:30.404
Here we are, go on.

221
00:13:31.804 --> 00:13:34.904
Five boats altogether

222
00:13:34.904 --> 00:13:37.404
and one of them is huge.

223
00:13:43.204 --> 00:13:47.204
This is the same stuff that was on Mr. Kaneda's finger.

224
00:13:48.004 --> 00:13:52.904
But he wasn't there when the food got to their room.

225
00:13:53.704 --> 00:13:58.204
Was the whiskey and ice on this boat just now?

226
00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:02.304
Yes. The reservation specifically stated this boat was to be used,

227
00:14:02.304 --> 00:14:07.404
the food was to be served at 7:30 and the drinks at 8:00.

228
00:14:12.504 --> 00:14:15.204
A small motor and sensor...

229
00:14:15.204 --> 00:14:17.304
There's a lot of space inside.

230
00:14:17.304 --> 00:14:20.104
So all that's left is the alibi.

231
00:14:22.804 --> 00:14:24.304
Thank you very much.

232
00:14:47.904 --> 00:14:50.404
There's one wrapper missing.

233
00:14:52.404 --> 00:14:54.104
This is...

234
00:14:54.104 --> 00:14:55.904
I see.

235
00:14:55.904 --> 00:14:58.304
So that's why that person did that.

236
00:15:02.304 --> 00:15:03.504
I found it.

237
00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:06.604
A tiny hole and a wet spot.

238
00:15:06.604 --> 00:15:08.904
That person's alibi has just been cracked.

239
00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:12.904
On top of that, I've got undeniable evidence.

240
00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.893
Pops, may I talk to you?

241
00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:23.293
Go away! You're bothering me!

242
00:15:23.293 --> 00:15:26.693
I found something really weird.

243
00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:28.393
Something weird?

244
00:15:29.693 --> 00:15:32.293
What? I can't hear you.

245
00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:38.193
Inspector, all the customers in Room 7 have alibis.

246
00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:41.493
Excuse me. How much longer do we have to stay?

247
00:15:41.493 --> 00:15:45.293
Yes, you're right. I suppose you two can go.

248
00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:47.593
Not yet! It's too early.

249
00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:48.893
What?

250
00:15:48.893 --> 00:15:53.893
The truth is, I know how the killer got to the room.

251
00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:56.993
You do? Why don't you explain?

252
00:15:56.993 --> 00:16:01.893
We were right the killer did use the waterway.

253
00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:04.793
-Come on. -Listen, Mr. Mouri.

254
00:16:04.793 --> 00:16:08.593
All the witnesses agree there were only boats on the waterway.

255
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:12.193
That's right. The killer used a boat.

256
00:16:12.193 --> 00:16:13.593
A boat?

257
00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:18.593
A small person could hide in the big boat.

258
00:16:18.593 --> 00:16:20.893
There's enough room.

259
00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:22.393
First, the killer requests

260
00:16:22.393 --> 00:16:27.693
that the larger boat be used to serve their complete meal.

261
00:16:27.693 --> 00:16:30.793
He takes the food off and removes the clapboard

262
00:16:30.793 --> 00:16:33.093
then he gets in.

263
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:35.993
The boat returns to its berth by sensor.

264
00:16:35.993 --> 00:16:37.693
Before it gets there,

265
00:16:37.693 --> 00:16:40.993
he turns the sensor off using his foot.

266
00:16:40.993 --> 00:16:42.593
The boat's motor goes off

267
00:16:42.593 --> 00:16:45.293
and it reaches Room 8.

268
00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:48.593
Kaneda must have been really surprised at first.

269
00:16:48.593 --> 00:16:51.293
But he wasn't worried after all.

270
00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:57.493
He would never suspect a friend would come to kill him.

271
00:16:57.493 --> 00:17:00.093
The killer used this element of surprise...

272
00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:03.493
and killed him.

273
00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:08.293
So no one would think he came in through the waterway,

274
00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:11.693
the killer made Mr. Kaneda face the doorway.

275
00:17:11.693 --> 00:17:13.493
I see.

276
00:17:13.493 --> 00:17:17.693
But then, how did the killer get back into his own room?

277
00:17:17.693 --> 00:17:19.493
It's simple.

278
00:17:19.493 --> 00:17:21.293
He got back into the boat

279
00:17:21.293 --> 00:17:23.793
and turned the sensor back on,

280
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:27.693
the boat will automatically go back to the dock.

281
00:17:27.693 --> 00:17:31.093
All he needs to do now is wait.

282
00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.593
As directed,

283
00:17:33.593 --> 00:17:36.093
the boat would carry their drinks to the room at 8:00.

284
00:17:38.193 --> 00:17:41.093
But unfortunately for the killer,

285
00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:44.793
I noticed something.

286
00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:46.893
What was that?

287
00:17:46.893 --> 00:17:49.493
The waterline.

288
00:17:49.493 --> 00:17:52.593
There was only that whiskey set on the boat,

289
00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:55.493
yet the waterline was extremely high.

290
00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:02.793
What it proves is that the killer had been in the boat.

291
00:18:03.593 --> 00:18:05.593
Wait a minute!

292
00:18:05.593 --> 00:18:07.993
The only one who could have remained in the room alone

293
00:18:07.993 --> 00:18:10.893
and who was a friend is...

294
00:18:10.893 --> 00:18:14.493
Yes. The murderer is Professor Iwama!

295
00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.693
It could only have been you.

296
00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:18.593
What?

297
00:18:18.593 --> 00:18:21.293
Professor...

298
00:18:21.293 --> 00:18:23.593
You probably told him

299
00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:27.493
you wanted to speak to him in private in another room

300
00:18:27.493 --> 00:18:30.493
and had him reserve Room 8.

301
00:18:30.493 --> 00:18:32.493
And when the food arrived,

302
00:18:32.493 --> 00:18:35.893
you sent Mr. Arai out to buy your cigarettes.

303
00:18:35.893 --> 00:18:39.293
Deliberately asking for a brand they don't sell at the register

304
00:18:39.293 --> 00:18:41.393
so he'd have to go to a convenience store.

305
00:18:41.393 --> 00:18:43.393
Hold it right there, Mr. Mouri!

306
00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:44.693
You yourself testified that

307
00:18:44.693 --> 00:18:48.393
I was in my room at the time of the crime!

308
00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:53.493
With that alibi, how could I have killed Kaneda?

309
00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:57.293
You have a tape recorder, don't you?

310
00:18:58.293 --> 00:18:59.593
Of course I do.

311
00:18:59.593 --> 00:19:04.293
It's a small one I carry around in my bag for meetings.

312
00:19:04.293 --> 00:19:06.693
Even if I could use it to tape voices and sounds,

313
00:19:06.693 --> 00:19:08.893
how would I close the sliding door?

314
00:19:08.893 --> 00:19:12.093
How about by using a rubber band, a pin,

315
00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:14.493
a chopstick wrapper and ice?

316
00:19:16.793 --> 00:19:19.693
First, you use the pin to hold the rubber band in place

317
00:19:19.693 --> 00:19:21.693
to the sliding door and it's frame.

318
00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.293
Then you stuff the chopstick wrapper

319
00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:25.693
into the sliding door on the other side

320
00:19:25.693 --> 00:19:28.293
and tack one end down.

321
00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:31.093
Then you pull the door with the rubber band

322
00:19:31.093 --> 00:19:33.393
attached to the chopstick wrapper

323
00:19:33.393 --> 00:19:37.193
and pin it through the chopstick wrapper.

324
00:19:37.193 --> 00:19:39.693
The finishing touch, you took ice from the food

325
00:19:39.693 --> 00:19:43.393
and put it on the wrapper circle.

326
00:19:43.393 --> 00:19:45.793
The ice will melt making the paper wrapper soft

327
00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:47.193
and when it breaks...

328
00:19:47.993 --> 00:19:51.693
the rubber band will snap back closing the door.

329
00:19:51.693 --> 00:19:53.093
I see.

330
00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:55.593
When you returned to the room, Mr. Iwama,

331
00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:59.493
you got rid of the rubber band and tacks and erased the tape.

332
00:19:59.493 --> 00:20:02.493
And if you threw the wrapper into the waterway,

333
00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:05.893
there'd be no evidence left.

334
00:20:05.893 --> 00:20:08.793
That's right. There's no evidence.

335
00:20:08.793 --> 00:20:11.393
If you're accusing me of killing Kaneda,

336
00:20:11.393 --> 00:20:13.893
show me the proof show me! Show me!

337
00:20:13.893 --> 00:20:15.293
Mr. Arai.

338
00:20:15.293 --> 00:20:17.293
When you took the food off the boat

339
00:20:17.293 --> 00:20:20.893
did you spill the sauce for the blowfish milt?

340
00:20:20.893 --> 00:20:22.893
Yes, I did.

341
00:20:22.893 --> 00:20:25.993
I spill it on the clapboard.

342
00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.493
Mr. Iwama.

343
00:20:27.493 --> 00:20:31.293
When Miss Anzai screamed and you came out of the room,

344
00:20:31.293 --> 00:20:33.693
you had your jacket on, didn't you?

345
00:20:33.693 --> 00:20:37.893
No one would bother to put their jacket on in an emergency.

346
00:20:37.893 --> 00:20:40.593
But you did because the sauce got on your shirt

347
00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:45.293
when you got into the boat, isn't that right?

348
00:20:45.293 --> 00:20:49.993
Mr. Iwama. Will you remove your jacket?

349
00:20:49.993 --> 00:20:53.293
I do have a sauce stain on it.

350
00:20:53.293 --> 00:20:55.893
But I got it when I spilled the sauce

351
00:20:55.893 --> 00:20:58.693
while I was looking for my contact lens.

352
00:20:58.693 --> 00:21:00.493
I wonder.

353
00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:03.993
Mr. Kaneda left the room before the food arrived

354
00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:07.193
but he had some sauce on his thumb.

355
00:21:07.193 --> 00:21:08.793
What?

356
00:21:08.793 --> 00:21:11.793
I wonder when he got it?

357
00:21:13.593 --> 00:21:15.693
It... it can't be...

358
00:21:15.693 --> 00:21:16.793
That's right.

359
00:21:16.793 --> 00:21:21.093
When you stabbed him, he grabbed you there.

360
00:21:21.093 --> 00:21:23.993
Right on that stain on your shirt.

361
00:21:23.993 --> 00:21:30.293
Consequently, Mr. Kaneda's fingerprint is on your shirt.

362
00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:36.093
Kaneda heard that in the past,

363
00:21:36.093 --> 00:21:39.393
I had put my name on a student's thesis paper

364
00:21:39.393 --> 00:21:40.993
and passed it off as my own.

365
00:21:40.993 --> 00:21:42.793
He threatened to make it public

366
00:21:42.793 --> 00:21:44.093
if I didn't recommend him

367
00:21:44.093 --> 00:21:47.693
for the assistant professor's position to the selection committee.

368
00:21:47.693 --> 00:21:51.493
On top of that, he wanted me to give him 5 million yen.

369
00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:54.293
I couldn't put up with it anymore!

370
00:21:56.093 --> 00:22:00.593
The blowfish milt was an unexpected order.

371
00:22:00.593 --> 00:22:04.093
If he hadn't ordered it, I would have gotten away.

372
00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:33.893
"Mouri Detective Agency"

373
00:23:38.493 --> 00:23:39.893
Remenber "Ryusuitei"?

374
00:23:39.893 --> 00:23:43.293
Since the murder, they've gotten popular again.

375
00:23:44.493 --> 00:23:47.093
Hey, dad. Take us there again.

376
00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:49.793
Sure, as long as there are geishas there.

377
00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:56.693
How about if I serve you then?

378
00:23:56.693 --> 00:23:59.093
No, no thank you!

379
00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:02.493
Scary.

380
00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:05.793
"Next Episode"

381
00:24:16.693 --> 00:24:18.493
I don't know anything.

382
00:24:18.493 --> 00:24:21.693
But I'm excited.

383
00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:24.393
The more I don't know, the more it excites me!

384
00:24:24.393 --> 00:24:27.393
That unsurpassable curiosity inside of me!

385
00:24:27.993 --> 00:24:29.693
Next Conan,

386
00:24:29.693 --> 00:24:33.493
"Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun (Part 1)"

387
00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:36.195
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:36.195 --> 00:24:38.595
"Motion sickness pills"

389
00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:39.995
The next episode is a 1 hour special.

390
00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:43.295
That long lost hero takes control.
