1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.270
As long as people are
involved in modern-day crimes,

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.670
there are no unsolvable mysteries!

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.640
Today's case is about
a mysterious murder weapon!

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.180
Let's use our heads
to figure it out!

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.190
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.640
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.180
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:38.007
The Case of the
Mysterious Murder Weapon.

9
00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:44.497
It's nice to take a leisurely
walk together once in a while!

10
00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:45.997
Yeah!

11
00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:48.917
What's so fun about
walking with that runt?!

12
00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.497
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

13
00:01:57.457 --> 00:01:59.387
What is it, Conan-kun?

14
00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:01.577
A little bird...

15
00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:02.917
Is it dead?

16
00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.787
No. It looks okay.

17
00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:06.107
It's still alive.

18
00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.397
It doesn't seem to be hurt...

19
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.277
It flew off...

20
00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:19.577
What a weird bird. Maybe
it had an anemic attack?

21
00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:23.497
It's coming from
that apartment building!

22
00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:32.607
Whoops...

23
00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:40.807
There are only two
apartments occupied here!

24
00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:42.787
Can I help you?

25
00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:46.577
We just heard a woman
scream from this building!

26
00:02:46.577 --> 00:02:50.647
Are you sure?
I didn't hear anything...

27
00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:55.117
Welcome back. You're back early.

28
00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.577
Is something the matter?

29
00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:58.747
Well, these folks here--

30
00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:01.867
Are you all right?!

31
00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.997
It's horrible! My husband!

32
00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:06.587
My husband was
murdered on our veranda!

33
00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.457
I'm Detective Mori.

34
00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.537
I take it you're
the one who screamed?

35
00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:14.957
Which room is yours?

36
00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:17.177
Room 715.

37
00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:23.077
Say, I looked at
the mail board earlier.

38
00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.867
Hardly anybody lives here, huh?

39
00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.247
This place is going to
be demolished this month.

40
00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:29.747
So the only ones living here now

41
00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:34.407
are Imoto, who runs his own business,
and Terasawa-san here.

42
00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.407
Allow me.

43
00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:51.507
High heels and two
pairs of men's shoes...

44
00:04:00.097 --> 00:04:03.307
Real Estate Agent
Ryusuke Imoto, 39 years old

45
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.247
He's been hit in the back of the head.

46
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.537
The murder weapon appears to
have been a flower pot or the like.

47
00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:11.577
Who are you?

48
00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:13.777
My name is Dobashi.

49
00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.917
Did you kill him?!

50
00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:17.277
No!

51
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.877
So the cause of death was brain damage...

52
00:04:29.877 --> 00:04:34.417
The killer most likely lifted
up a flower pot from behind him

53
00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:36.867
and brought it down
as hard as possible.

54
00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:38.797
Hey, Inspector.

55
00:04:39.077 --> 00:04:41.257
There's a mark here,

56
00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:44.367
maybe it has something
to do with the murder--

57
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.387
Alright, you!

58
00:04:45.747 --> 00:04:50.807
Will you ever learn to stop
butting in during our investigations?!

59
00:04:54.457 --> 00:04:55.577
Interesting.

60
00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.857
There definitely is a mark here.

61
00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:03.327
It seems extremely new
compared to all the other marks.

62
00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:08.707
The victim was Mr. Ryusuke
Imoto, 39 years old

63
00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:11.787
and president of NEED,
a real estate agency.

64
00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:16.667
It was his wife, Takako-san,
who found him. Correct?

65
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:17.627
Yes.

66
00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:21.667
And the person found
standing in front of the body

67
00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:23.597
when Mori-kun and
the others came rushing in...

68
00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:28.117
My name is Dobashi.
I manage an import company.

69
00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:32.037
I'm Imoto-kun's former boss and
the one who introduced him to his wife.

70
00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:35.067
I came to see him today
about a business matter.

71
00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:37.497
His matchmaker, eh...

72
00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:39.107
And you are?

73
00:05:39.107 --> 00:05:43.957
Terasawa. I live on
the 5th floor of this building.

74
00:05:43.957 --> 00:05:45.947
I used to run a fishing goods store.

75
00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:48.407
"Used to"?

76
00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:52.167
Imoto took control of my store!

77
00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:54.877
He used some dirty
legal loophole to do it!

78
00:05:55.247 --> 00:05:58.297
He was a terrible man!

79
00:05:58.537 --> 00:06:04.047
My guess is he did the same
sort of things to these people too!

80
00:06:04.327 --> 00:06:07.077
Well, you two?

81
00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:08.117
Yes.

82
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:12.037
As their matchmaker,
I shouldn't be saying this,

83
00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.617
but he and his wife were in
the middle of getting divorced

84
00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:17.247
and there was trouble
about the compensation.

85
00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:18.667
But that wouldn't matter if he died--

86
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.327
she'd get his inheritance instead!

87
00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.317
What are you talking about?!

88
00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:24.457
I heard my husband constantly
refused your requests for a loan

89
00:06:24.457 --> 00:06:28.417
because your company was on
the verge of going out of business!

90
00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:30.787
So you couldn't
handle it and killed him!

91
00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:32.617
What?!

92
00:06:32.617 --> 00:06:35.037
Now, now. Calm down, ma'am.

93
00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.117
By the way, Apartment Manager.

94
00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:41.007
Is that main door the only way
in and out of this building?

95
00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:43.217
Yes.

96
00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:47.257
And the only ones who
entered besides the victim...

97
00:06:47.257 --> 00:06:52.687
...were his wife, Dobashi-san,
and Terasawa-san.

98
00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:57.497
Moreover, each of you had a
decent enough motive to kill the victim.

99
00:06:57.497 --> 00:07:02.397
In other words, one of
you three murdered him.

100
00:07:02.747 --> 00:07:04.667
You can't be serious!

101
00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.247
First you, ma'am.

102
00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:09.367
Please explain the situation
when you found the body.

103
00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:18.867
It was a little after 5:00
when I arrived here.

104
00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:21.377
More precisely,
it was just after 5:05.

105
00:07:21.377 --> 00:07:24.967
I record when everyone
enters or leaves the building.

106
00:07:25.247 --> 00:07:28.457
That'll be very handy for us!

107
00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:30.927
Please continue.

108
00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.617
The reason I came here today

109
00:07:33.617 --> 00:07:36.537
was to discuss the compensation
with my husband one more time,

110
00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:38.867
just as Dobashi-san mentioned earlier.

111
00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:42.107
He and I have been living
apart for quite a while now.

112
00:07:42.577 --> 00:07:44.247
When I came in,

113
00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:47.577
my husband was practicing
Tai Chi on the veranda by himself.

114
00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:48.827
Tai Chi?

115
00:07:48.827 --> 00:07:49.917
Yes.

116
00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:54.037
My husband did it every
morning and evening for his health.

117
00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:57.327
He didn't notice
when I entered the room,

118
00:07:57.327 --> 00:07:59.457
and I didn't call out to him.

119
00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:04.797
When I looked out the veranda
again after using the bathroom...

120
00:08:08.997 --> 00:08:11.217
...my husband was dead!

121
00:08:11.577 --> 00:08:16.537
So basically, your husband died
while you were in the bathroom?

122
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:17.917
Yes.

123
00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:22.147
Pardon my asking, but how
long were you in the bathroom for?

124
00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:26.207
Only about two minutes, I think...

125
00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:30.487
Which means your husband
died at approximately 5:08.

126
00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:32.327
While you were in the bathroom,

127
00:08:32.327 --> 00:08:35.957
did you hear any
sounds or people talking?

128
00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:37.867
No.

129
00:08:37.867 --> 00:08:41.387
Say, when you entered the apartment,

130
00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.587
were there any shoes by the door?

131
00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:48.007
Yes, just a pair of my husband's shoes.

132
00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:49.957
Thank you.

133
00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:51.717
Now you, Dobashi-san.

134
00:08:52.207 --> 00:08:55.917
Around what time did you first arrive?

135
00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:59.707
A little before 5:00, I believe.

136
00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:02.937
I was to meet with Imoto-kun
at 5 o'clock, you see.

137
00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:05.897
More precisely, 4:58.

138
00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:09.417
Just as his wife said,
the reason I came here

139
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:12.867
was to ask for a loan one last time.

140
00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:13.957
But...

141
00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:18.707
It's pointless,
no matter how hard you try!

142
00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:23.537
I have no desire
or reason to help you out!

143
00:09:23.537 --> 00:09:26.167
Now please leave.

144
00:09:26.577 --> 00:09:29.867
After that, I went to the roof.

145
00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:31.367
To commit suicide.

146
00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:32.367
Suicide?!

147
00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:35.767
But I couldn't do it.

148
00:09:35.767 --> 00:09:39.327
I stood there for a while, in a daze.

149
00:09:39.327 --> 00:09:44.277
It was then that I heard her scream
from the other side of the roof!

150
00:09:45.997 --> 00:09:48.647
Then, when I rushed into the room...

151
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:52.827
...Imoto-san was dead
on the veranda, correct?

152
00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:54.117
Yes.

153
00:09:54.537 --> 00:09:57.287
How about you, Terasawa-san?

154
00:09:58.327 --> 00:10:02.417
What do I have to do with it?
I wasn't in the building.

155
00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:04.247
We just need to make sure.

156
00:10:04.247 --> 00:10:07.327
Around what time did
you leave the building?

157
00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:11.087
I believe it was
a little before 5:00...

158
00:10:11.087 --> 00:10:13.577
4:50, to be precise.

159
00:10:13.577 --> 00:10:17.827
And he didn't
return until just after 5:12.

160
00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:18.637
But...

161
00:10:18.637 --> 00:10:19.637
"But"?

162
00:10:19.637 --> 00:10:25.857
He came back from his golf
practice rather earlier than usual...

163
00:10:25.857 --> 00:10:28.917
I changed my mind on the way there.

164
00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:31.537
I've always been a
bit spur-of-the-moment!

165
00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:37.917
What do you think, Mori-kun?

166
00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:42.917
First, Terasawa-san.

167
00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:48.077
You weren't in the building
when Imoto-san was killed,

168
00:10:48.077 --> 00:10:49.677
so you're not the killer.

169
00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:54.337
The issue here is with
his wife and Dobashi-san.

170
00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:55.927
First you, ma'am!

171
00:10:55.927 --> 00:11:00.887
You said you found your husband's
body after you left the bathroom,

172
00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:04.247
but there's the possibility that
you never went to the bathroom,

173
00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:08.207
and that you killed your husband,
pretended to find him,

174
00:11:08.207 --> 00:11:09.577
and then screamed!

175
00:11:09.577 --> 00:11:11.107
What?!

176
00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:12.707
And you, Dobashi-san!

177
00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:16.167
You said you went up to the roof

178
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:18.097
after Imoto-san refused
to lend you money,

179
00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:21.327
but there's a possibility
you were actually in his office

180
00:11:21.327 --> 00:11:24.917
or with him on the veranda!

181
00:11:25.207 --> 00:11:28.247
All you can see from here
is a small part of the veranda.

182
00:11:28.247 --> 00:11:32.117
It's also possible
that when his wife came in,

183
00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:34.497
you were on the
veranda or in his office,

184
00:11:34.497 --> 00:11:37.167
killed the victim while
she was in the bathroom,

185
00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:38.807
and then went up to the roof.

186
00:11:39.117 --> 00:11:40.417
You got it all wrong!

187
00:11:40.417 --> 00:11:44.577
I was already on the roof by
the time she came in here!

188
00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:48.227
She even said that only
Imoto-kun's shoes were by the door!

189
00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:51.997
It's also possible that
she didn't remember correctly!

190
00:11:51.997 --> 00:11:56.447
Or do you have proof that you
were on the roof the whole time?!

191
00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:58.207
Proof?

192
00:11:58.207 --> 00:12:01.747
No, there was no one on the roof, so...

193
00:12:01.747 --> 00:12:04.537
That's right! I heard a sound!

194
00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:05.667
A sound?!

195
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:09.247
Yes. It was a loud, metallic sound.

196
00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:11.037
It came from the
area around this veranda.

197
00:12:11.037 --> 00:12:13.247
You heard a sound?

198
00:12:13.247 --> 00:12:15.587
Yes. A metallic one.

199
00:12:15.587 --> 00:12:20.347
Hey, could that sound have been
something hitting the handrail?

200
00:12:20.617 --> 00:12:23.517
See, there's a fresh mark on it!

201
00:12:26.557 --> 00:12:30.517
It appears something
hit it from below...

202
00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:34.857
That's it! That's the sound!

203
00:12:36.997 --> 00:12:39.117
The marks look similar...

204
00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:43.367
But the other mark
was made coming up...

205
00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:44.367
Yes.

206
00:12:44.367 --> 00:12:47.577
But there's no question
that someone hit it.

207
00:12:48.077 --> 00:12:50.787
Did you hear the sound, ma'am?

208
00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:52.367
No.

209
00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:56.217
I probably didn't hear it
because I was in the bathroom.

210
00:12:56.217 --> 00:12:57.867
That's odd...

211
00:12:57.867 --> 00:13:01.427
Why would someone put
a mark in a place like that?

212
00:13:02.327 --> 00:13:04.207
It makes no sense...

213
00:13:04.207 --> 00:13:06.417
This handrail seems suspicious,

214
00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:10.647
but in my opinion none of
them seem to be lying, either.

215
00:13:10.647 --> 00:13:11.997
But Inspector!

216
00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:13.997
Just because Dobashi heard
a sound from the handrail

217
00:13:13.997 --> 00:13:17.247
that isn't proof that
he was on the roof!

218
00:13:17.247 --> 00:13:18.667
He or the victim
might've made the sound

219
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:22.077
while he was on the veranda!

220
00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:25.917
Besides, if the
killer was someone else,

221
00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:29.077
that means they flew in
like a bird to kill the victim,

222
00:13:29.077 --> 00:13:32.417
then flew off the exact
same way they came!

223
00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:34.827
Which would never, ever happen!

224
00:13:34.827 --> 00:13:37.127
You do have a point...

225
00:13:37.577 --> 00:13:41.627
A bird? A bird?!

226
00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:47.177
Come to think of it,
the spot where the bird fell--

227
00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.617
--was over there!

228
00:13:50.617 --> 00:13:53.147
Directly in front of the
mark on this handrail!

229
00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:55.607
The location where
the victim collapsed...

230
00:13:55.607 --> 00:13:57.457
The location where the bird fell...

231
00:13:57.457 --> 00:13:58.677
The mark on the handrail!

232
00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:03.787
An abandoned building
across the street?

233
00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:06.787
Now I see!

234
00:14:06.787 --> 00:14:08.707
This is the killer's trick!

235
00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:11.117
The murder weapon
wasn't a flower pot!

236
00:14:12.577 --> 00:14:14.647
The killer was that person!

237
00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:22.915
My deductions
can't possibly be wrong.

238
00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:25.775
She's his wife,
who lives separately from him.

239
00:14:26.945 --> 00:14:29.195
He's the president
of an import company.

240
00:14:29.195 --> 00:14:33.135
And he's the former owner
of a fishing goods store.

241
00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:34.995
Which means the killer is...

242
00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:37.265
Say, Inspector.

243
00:14:37.265 --> 00:14:40.225
I'll be returning
to my apartment now...

244
00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:41.905
Oh, right.

245
00:14:41.905 --> 00:14:42.865
You can go for today...

246
00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:44.695
I can't let that happen!
You can go for today...

247
00:14:45.115 --> 00:14:47.215
I have to make the
old man realize it somehow!

248
00:14:54.785 --> 00:14:55.825
Found it!

249
00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:05.625
Have you figured
anything out, Mori-kun?

250
00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:10.075
No, nothing at all...

251
00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.305
In that case, you may
leave, Terasawa-san.

252
00:15:13.305 --> 00:15:14.535
Alright.

253
00:15:14.535 --> 00:15:16.405
What's going to happen to me?

254
00:15:16.405 --> 00:15:17.265
And me?

255
00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:21.315
This is fun!

256
00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:27.665
Stupid kid...

257
00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:42.665
Come on, realize it!

258
00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:45.915
Mori-kun!

259
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.545
This is the spot where
the victim collapsed.

260
00:15:51.365 --> 00:15:56.385
And this is the mark on the handrail.

261
00:15:57.945 --> 00:15:59.785
What are you doing?

262
00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:03.655
Conan, that bird
fell down there, right?

263
00:16:03.655 --> 00:16:04.975
Yeah, that's right!

264
00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:12.655
That's it!

265
00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:16.495
The victim, the mark, that bird,
and that abandoned building!

266
00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:18.455
They're all directly lined up!

267
00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:21.655
I know who did it, Inspector!

268
00:16:21.655 --> 00:16:24.415
Really? Who?!

269
00:16:24.945 --> 00:16:26.865
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

270
00:16:26.865 --> 00:16:30.965
I'll explain everything atop
that abandoned building!

271
00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:32.635
Come again?

272
00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:49.565
Come on, Mori-kun.

273
00:16:49.565 --> 00:16:52.655
What are you checking
for in a place like this?

274
00:16:52.655 --> 00:16:54.825
I don't see what this
has to do with the murder...

275
00:16:59.405 --> 00:17:02.535
Everyone gather around here, please!

276
00:17:06.195 --> 00:17:08.655
First, allow me to ask.

277
00:17:08.655 --> 00:17:11.035
Ma'am, Dobashi-san,
Terasawa-san...

278
00:17:11.035 --> 00:17:14.005
Have any of you
ever been here before?

279
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.325
Of course not.

280
00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:18.365
Me neither.

281
00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:21.195
Nor have I.

282
00:17:21.195 --> 00:17:23.095
Then allow me to explain.

283
00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:27.065
You can see the victim's
veranda from here, can't you?

284
00:17:27.785 --> 00:17:31.275
Yes, but what does that
have to do with anything?

285
00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:34.695
Have you ever heard
of surf casting, Inspector?

286
00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:36.195
Surf casting?

287
00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:41.325
It's a type of fishing that
uses a so-called "spinning reel"

288
00:17:41.325 --> 00:17:45.155
to allow the fisher to cast the
line some dozens of meters out.

289
00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:47.575
The killer used
this technique from here

290
00:17:47.575 --> 00:17:52.415
to hit the victim's head with a
weight as he stood on the veranda!

291
00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.625
What?!

292
00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:55.385
That's insane!

293
00:17:58.655 --> 00:18:01.555
This footprint is the proof.

294
00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:05.265
The left foot is in front
and with a lot of weight on it.

295
00:18:05.615 --> 00:18:09.755
This was made when the killer
flung the pole in an overhand fashion.

296
00:18:10.855 --> 00:18:11.775
Like this!

297
00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:18.655
When he was killed,
the victim was performing Tai Chi,

298
00:18:19.155 --> 00:18:21.325
which is known
for its slow movements.

299
00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:23.695
Using this fact,

300
00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:27.825
the killer swung the fishing
pole when he turned away!

301
00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:38.175
And as it was reeled in--

302
00:18:38.175 --> 00:18:40.885
--the weight hit the handrail.

303
00:18:40.885 --> 00:18:43.635
So that's the sound I heard?

304
00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:44.905
Correct.

305
00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:50.105
The killer didn't realize the weight
had left a mark when it happened.

306
00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:55.195
And there was one other
miscalculation on the killer's part.

307
00:18:55.195 --> 00:19:00.115
As the weight was being
reeled in, it hit a bird in mid-air.

308
00:19:03.405 --> 00:19:08.075
The bird you picked up had
probably received a concussion.

309
00:19:08.075 --> 00:19:12.785
But Mori-kun, it's over
thirty meters to that veranda.

310
00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:17.155
Could someone really cast a
weight that far with such precision?

311
00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:19.085
With enough practice, yes.

312
00:19:19.365 --> 00:19:22.805
Especially for someone
who's good at surf casting.

313
00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:25.765
Isn't that right, Terasawa-san?

314
00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:29.365
Terasawa-san.

315
00:19:29.365 --> 00:19:32.725
Those shoes you're wearing right now

316
00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:35.655
should undoubtedly
match these footprints.

317
00:19:35.655 --> 00:19:39.325
And if we look hard enough
around this abandoned building,

318
00:19:39.325 --> 00:19:40.405
we'll probably--

319
00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:43.725
Hey! There's something
on the ground here!

320
00:19:46.695 --> 00:19:47.905
What's that?

321
00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:50.195
I know what this is!
It's a pole grip!

322
00:19:50.195 --> 00:19:51.495
A pole grip?

323
00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:52.285
Yeah!

324
00:19:52.285 --> 00:19:56.195
Sometimes after fishermen
connect fishing rods together,

325
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.045
they won't come undone.

326
00:19:58.045 --> 00:20:00.195
So to prevent their
hands from slipping,

327
00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:04.845
they place rubber tubes or rubber
bands near where the rods connect,

328
00:20:04.845 --> 00:20:07.675
and then pull the rods apart while
twisting them in opposite directions!

329
00:20:07.945 --> 00:20:10.905
You're pretty smart to know that...

330
00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:13.865
I just happened to see it
on a TV fishing show yesterday.

331
00:20:13.865 --> 00:20:16.995
Come to think of it, they had their
gloves off when they used these.

332
00:20:16.995 --> 00:20:18.495
Because they would slip!

333
00:20:18.495 --> 00:20:21.905
Which means the killer's
fingerprints should be on it!

334
00:20:22.695 --> 00:20:25.945
Terasawa-san. Your fingerprints!

335
00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:32.665
I can't help but laugh.

336
00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:36.845
He took over my store

337
00:20:36.845 --> 00:20:39.995
and said he was going to build
a fashion building in its place!

338
00:20:39.995 --> 00:20:44.795
I said I'd give up ownership
if he'd just spare the store, but...

339
00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:50.155
There's no point in keeping
this dinky store around.

340
00:20:50.155 --> 00:20:53.305
What's so fun about
catching fish, anyway?

341
00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:54.745
What a joke!

342
00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:57.145
What do you losers
see in it at all?

343
00:21:10.155 --> 00:21:12.825
My precious fishing rod!

344
00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:16.085
He destroyed it
before my very eyes!

345
00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:25.295
I absolutely couldn't
let him get away with it!

346
00:23:03.335 --> 00:23:06.405
Your detective work last
night was amazing, Dad!

347
00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:08.625
My opinion of you
keeps getting better!

348
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:13.625
Cases like that are
a piece of cake for me!

349
00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:19.455
Did he actually
make that fishing rod toy

350
00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:21.365
to make me realize it?!

351
00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:23.635
