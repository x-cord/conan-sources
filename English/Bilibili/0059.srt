1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.800
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet,

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.840
a pop-up doll,
and broken ceramic!

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.470
Mystery-solving logic is helpful
against people's dry hearts!

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.000
Today is an exciting first errand!
Exhilaration turns into terror!

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.720
He sees the
single truth for what it is--

6
00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.659
The First Errand Murder Case.

7
00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.759
Beika Shopping Street--
First Errand Competition

8
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.729
I'm so glad it's sunny out!

9
00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:17.769
Ugh.

10
00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:22.859
You can do it!
Good luck!

11
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:36.189
Group â™ª1 has just left Beika Park!

12
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.789
What place will the Junior
Detective Club's own Wataru-kun get?

13
00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.839
We're counting on you guys!

14
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:44.499
Right!

15
00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.789
Get good shots, Mitsuhiko!

16
00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.379
You too, Genta-kun!

17
00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.259
Conan-kun! Don't get left behind!

18
00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.979
I won't!

19
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.229
Why do I have to do this too?

20
00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.059
Kids'll be kids. Go get 'em.

21
00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.149
Dad! Act more enthusiastic!

22
00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.069
The shopping street has
some of your biggest clients!

23
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.519
Hi, there!

24
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.419
Why did we accept this job?!

25
00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.879
Isn't it obvious?

26
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.349
So the public will love us!
We asked really hard for the job!

27
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.899
What? So we asked for the job?!

28
00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.809
Got a problem with that, Conan?!

29
00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.899
Never heard of such
a detective group...

30
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.149
Wataru-kun has just passed
the vegetable store! Oh no!

31
00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.579
Now he can't buy a daikon!
What will come of this?!

32
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:08.559
The Junior Detective League was
put in charge of recording the event.

33
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.109
It would later be aired on local TV,
and the children would get prizes

34
00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.049
depending on their rank.

35
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.509
The rules are simple.
Go alone from Beika Park

36
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.969
to Beika Shopping Street,
some 500 meters away,

37
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.359
buy the items on
the shopping list, and return.

38
00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:28.939
However, no parents or onlookers
can talk to or help them--

39
00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.279
they can only watch.

40
00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.609
But it's actually tough.

41
00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:37.869
Some kids keep coming back
to ask their mothers for help,

42
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:39.939
some kids get lost,

43
00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:45.789
some buy toys and
candy for themselves,

44
00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:49.799
and some spend all
their time in arcades.

45
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.259
Kids these days!

46
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.519
I can't watch this...

47
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.219
For sure...

48
00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:57.179
You guys are kids too.

49
00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.179
You can do it!

50
00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.859
His group's up!

51
00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:07.399
That's Hiroshi-kun;
he lives in my neighborhood!

52
00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:09.149
He hasn't started yet...

53
00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.109
Alright! Let's get 'em!

54
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.069
He's playing by himself?

55
00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.939
What're you doing? Come on!

56
00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.689
Hiroshi-kun's items are a toothbrush,
fried tofu, and a shugi-bukuro.

57
00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.079
What's a shugi-bukuro?

58
00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.329
You got me.

59
00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:29.269
Isn't it a bag for kings,
bishops, and pawns?

60
00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:30.229
That's it!

61
00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.019
That's 'shogi'! (chess)

62
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:36.969
Geez! Maybe you should enter too!
It'd be a good match!

63
00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.839
There he goes!

64
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.649
Let's follow!

65
00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.369
Where did he go?

66
00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:54.789
I don't see him anywhere...

67
00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.859
He couldn't have gotten far.

68
00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:00.079
This area is near your house, right?

69
00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:01.359
That's right.

70
00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:04.829
Which means that
his house is also nearby.

71
00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.169
Maybe he--

72
00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.039
went home?!

73
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:12.249
I didn't mean that.
Hiroshi-kun is a loner, right?

74
00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.149
Yes, but...

75
00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:20.219
So was I. I often
played alone, just like him.

76
00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.689
In my own home, or nearby...

77
00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.189
You did it!

78
00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:28.689
Impressive!

79
00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:33.649
Ayumi-chan. Does he often
play alone around here?

80
00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:38.109
The empty lot!
He's always playing there!

81
00:06:38.109 --> 00:06:39.229
Let's check it out!

82
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.539
There he is!

83
00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.959
Hiiiya!

84
00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:52.789
Geez, not again!

85
00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.259
He disappeared again...

86
00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:06.019
A bicycle track!

87
00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:10.689
It's fresh, and suddenly gets deeper.
It must've gotten heavier.

88
00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:14.149
In other words, Hiroshi-kun
got on the back of it...

89
00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.169
Conan-kun!

90
00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:18.729
Where are you going?!

91
00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:19.949
Wait for us!

92
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.829
Where to, Hiroshi-kun?

93
00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.659
Let me think...

94
00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:36.109
Bye bye!

95
00:07:36.109 --> 00:07:36.959
Bye!

96
00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.349
Hello!

97
00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:57.419
There he is!

98
00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:58.609
It's him!

99
00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.729
He waved and ran off...

100
00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:06.909
Is he playing a joke on us?

101
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:09.399
I don't think so...

102
00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:16.269
An abandoned building?
What was he doing here?

103
00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:17.919
Playing by himself again?

104
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.439
He finally made it.

105
00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:24.339
He sure is troublesome.

106
00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:30.229
He's finally at the shopping street!
Will he be able to do his errands?

107
00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:31.809
First is the toothbrush!

108
00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:37.559
Oh no! He has to buy
the toothbrush here!

109
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.529
Maybe he's gonna get
the fried tofu first?

110
00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:50.419
This is hopeless.

111
00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:52.119
Oh, Hiroshi-kun...

112
00:09:08.609 --> 00:09:11.929
What the... Someone cut this!

113
00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:15.269
What're you doing,
Conan?! Let's go!

114
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:16.189
Right!

115
00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:22.219
A stationery shop?

116
00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:24.609
What's he buying here?

117
00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:27.529
One shugi-bukuro, please!

118
00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:29.449
Sure thing!

119
00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:33.829
Here you are. That'll be 200 yen.

120
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:36.479
That's a shugi-bukuro?!

121
00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:38.019
Wow, Hiroshi-kun!

122
00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:39.309
It was pure luck.

123
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:42.299
Only two left! What will he do?!

124
00:09:42.729 --> 00:09:43.419
Here you are.

125
00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:44.149
Thank you!

126
00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:01.589
Hiroshi-kun! Look out!

127
00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:06.439
Hey!

128
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.109
We won't make it!

129
00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:09.359
Alright!

130
00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:12.119
Go!

131
00:10:20.189 --> 00:10:22.209
That was close...

132
00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:27.169
No way! I put the side brake on!

133
00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:31.139
That rope and this car!
What's going on?!

134
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.819
Where's Hiroshi-kun?

135
00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:34.169
Oh, crap!

136
00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:36.149
Did we lose him again?!

137
00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:39.239
It's because you weren't filming!

138
00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:40.309
It's because you weren't!

139
00:10:40.309 --> 00:10:41.099
What?!

140
00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:44.569
Is someone out to get
Hiroshi-kun?!

141
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:45.929
Hey! Conan!

142
00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:46.859
What is it?!

143
00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:48.709
Let's find Hiroshi-kun!

144
00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:05.839
This is Hiroshi's Yaiba figure!

145
00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:07.059
But where is he?!

146
00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:09.479
He finally started his errands!

147
00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:10.189
No!

148
00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:15.309
He treasures this figure.
It's weird for him to just leave it here.

149
00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.889
Then where did he go?

150
00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:19.309
I don't know!

151
00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:22.899
But he didn't go of his
own accord! He was taken!

152
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:24.609
He was kidnapped!

153
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:26.459
What?!

154
00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:27.229
By who?!

155
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:32.699
I don't know! But someone tried
to kill him in fake accidents!

156
00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:36.199
But they failed twice, so then--

157
00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:38.569
That's bad!

158
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:40.059
He'll be killed!

159
00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:42.169
Let's call the police!

160
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.939
But this is just a theory!

161
00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:47.129
I'm not sure they'd believe us...

162
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:49.089
What should we do then?

163
00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:51.649
First, let's find Hiroshi-kun!

164
00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:55.789
Then we can call the police!
I hope I'm wrong, though...

165
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:19.511
No luck!

166
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:20.811
He's not that way, either!

167
00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:23.411
Maybe we should go to the cops...

168
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:28.011
Wait! If he is being targeted, then why?!

169
00:12:28.011 --> 00:12:30.371
Maybe that'll tell us where he is!

170
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:37.211
Genta. Mitsuhiko. Play back all
your footage of Hiroshi-kun!

171
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.511
Did they tape something suspicious?

172
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:46.071
I didn't notice anything...

173
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:47.141
Me neither...

174
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:51.521
No! Go back a little!

175
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.361
Go back more!

176
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.141
Play that part again and pause it!

177
00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:14.091
That's it!

178
00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:15.181
Huh?

179
00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:17.381
What did you find?

180
00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:22.601
Look closely. In Genta's camera,
he looks like he's waving at us...

181
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:25.801
...but in Mitsuhiko's camera--

182
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.291
What is this?

183
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:28.641
A curb mirror?

184
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.441
So Hiroshi-kun was waving at this?

185
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:33.681
Exactly.

186
00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:37.471
More precisely, at a reflection
of something in this mirror.

187
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:49.911
The window!

188
00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:52.671
Ah! Now I get it!

189
00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:56.181
He was waving to
someone in that window!

190
00:13:56.181 --> 00:14:00.261
That's right.
He didn't stop here to play.

191
00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:04.011
He had some kind of reason!

192
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:08.471
But what does that have to do
with him being kidnapped?

193
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:11.221
That's what we're checking.

194
00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:17.061
Looks like I'm right!

195
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:19.821
Hiroshi-kun's hat!

196
00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:21.851
Does that mean he's inside?

197
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:25.491
Danger- Building Demolition

198
00:14:25.491 --> 00:14:29.811
The demolition is today!
We don't have much time!

199
00:14:29.811 --> 00:14:32.451
Alright! I'll go in alone...

200
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:35.011
Let's go, Junior Detective League!

201
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:50.141
Careful-- the floor is fragile.

202
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.221
Doesn't seem to be in here...

203
00:14:58.891 --> 00:15:00.731
Let's check upstairs!

204
00:15:00.731 --> 00:15:03.441
No Entrance

205
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.931
We can't go any further.

206
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:08.781
That means nobody's upstairs.

207
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:11.121
We can go downstairs, though!

208
00:15:11.531 --> 00:15:12.641
A basement?!

209
00:15:18.311 --> 00:15:20.221
Do you think he's down here?

210
00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:22.131
Hiroshi-kun! Are you there?

211
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:25.311
It's too dark to see anything...

212
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.811
Hiroshi-kun!

213
00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:36.911
A dead guy!

214
00:15:36.911 --> 00:15:38.191
Is Hiroshi-kun dead too?!

215
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:43.181
It's alright. He's alive.

216
00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:47.141
An anesthetic!

217
00:15:47.141 --> 00:15:50.531
So he was kidnapped and
brought here... by the killer!

218
00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:53.601
But what is a dead body doing here?

219
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:55.441
And why Hiroshi-kun?

220
00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:03.221
The killer planned to make the
murder look like a demolition accident.

221
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:11.141
The first floor was fragile;
if any debris fell during the demolition,

222
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:15.471
the basement would be wrecked.
That was the plan.

223
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:19.261
But then Hiroshi-kun showed up.

224
00:16:20.141 --> 00:16:21.441
Hello!

225
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:29.391
Judging from his actions, I doubt
he witnessed the actual murder.

226
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:33.071
But the killer didn't
know how much he saw.

227
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:36.181
So they ran ahead
to the shopping street--

228
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.671
--but failed.

229
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:49.091
The killer eventually decided
to fake his death too.

230
00:16:49.891 --> 00:16:51.051
That's right.

231
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.891
You're pretty smart
for a couple of kids.

232
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:57.811
But this is the end.

233
00:16:58.971 --> 00:16:59.891
Oh no!

234
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:12.021
He's going to kill us too!

235
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:13.641
No way!

236
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:15.271
This can't be happening!

237
00:17:15.271 --> 00:17:16.621
No!

238
00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:21.721
What's taking them so long?

239
00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:25.931
Hiroshi-kun isn't back yet, either.
What could they be doing?

240
00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:30.051
Probably loitering around
somewhere. Kids'll be kids.

241
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:34.011
Let's get this done quickly.

242
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:44.391
No good. It won't budge.

243
00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:47.721
I don't wanna die down here!

244
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:49.641
Mommy!

245
00:17:49.641 --> 00:17:51.321
Ayumi-chan! Calm down!

246
00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:55.431
This is all because you
wouldn't call the police!

247
00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:59.471
But you're the one
who wanted to come in here!

248
00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:01.331
Yeah, but--

249
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:05.531
An earthquake?!

250
00:18:05.531 --> 00:18:09.011
No! The demolition's started!

251
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:23.401
It's all over!

252
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:24.721
It's hopeless!

253
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:25.641
Mommy!

254
00:18:34.851 --> 00:18:37.661
Running water? Could it be?

255
00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:40.511
We might survive, guys!

256
00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:54.341
Stop worrying!
They'll come back! Kids'll be kids!

257
00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:57.511
But what if something bad
has happened to them?!

258
00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.591
Let's look for them!

259
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:02.471
Stop pulling so hard!

260
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:06.021
What's that sound?

261
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:23.201
How did you...

262
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:25.241
Surprised?

263
00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:26.931
You shouldn't underestimate us!

264
00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:29.241
We're the Junior Detective League!

265
00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:30.891
Too bad, Mister.

266
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:35.171
We should've been crushed
along with that dead body,

267
00:19:35.171 --> 00:19:39.471
but thanks to the weak support struts,
the basement wall crumbled.

268
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.351
Luckily, it led right
into an underground tunnel...

269
00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:05.641
Mister! You have another store, right?

270
00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:07.011
That's great!

271
00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:13.001
Fried tofu and one toothbrush, please!

272
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:28.891
What?

273
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:31.011
What's going on?

274
00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:35.321
Oh! That was your
convenience store, wasn't it?

275
00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:36.581
That's right.

276
00:20:37.761 --> 00:20:41.891
A dirty stockbroker tricked me,
and I racked up more debt

277
00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:46.241
than I could ever pay off,
and my family ran out on me.

278
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:48.721
It was that
stockbroker that I killed.

279
00:20:52.431 --> 00:20:56.101
My store was
repossessed and shut down.

280
00:20:57.601 --> 00:21:00.851
It wasn't as popular as stores
on the shopping street--

281
00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:03.681
it would be quickly forgotten.

282
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:06.311
But Hiroshi-kun remembered it!

283
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:10.101
He came to buy from
your store for his first errand!

284
00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:14.021
Hello!

285
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:16.481
He did...

286
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:19.941
The very same Hiroshi-kun
that you tried to kill...

287
00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:23.351
I'm sorry, little boy! Forgive me!

288
00:21:24.181 --> 00:21:25.641
Conan-kun!

289
00:21:25.641 --> 00:21:27.371
What're you guys doing?!

290
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:32.491
A huge victory for the
Junior Detective League!

291
00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:04.671
Wow! That's what happened? Good job!

292
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:10.141
I guess kids'll be kids. How boring.

293
00:23:10.141 --> 00:23:13.261
Guess I'll have a bath, some booze,
and get some shut-eye!

294
00:23:13.971 --> 00:23:15.021
Dad!

295
00:23:16.971 --> 00:23:19.011
Oh? Where's Hiroshi-kun?

296
00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:20.891
He disappeared again?

297
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:22.111
There he is!

298
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:28.431
What were his last two things again?

299
00:23:28.431 --> 00:23:30.111
Um, fried tofu and--

300
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:31.431
A toothbrush!

301
00:23:31.431 --> 00:23:33.871
Alright! Let's go,
Junior Detective League!

302
00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:42.791
What the heck am I doing?
Why am I stuck doing this?

303
00:23:43.711 --> 00:23:45.921
What're you looking at, Conan-kun?

304
00:23:46.721 --> 00:23:49.141
I was watching that
apartment's veranda.

305
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:54.561
She jumped off!

306
00:23:56.141 --> 00:23:59.891
This was a murder!
Meaning the most suspicious person is--

307
00:24:00.931 --> 00:24:03.571
--the guy on the phone
who told her not to jump.

308
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:07.691
But how could he do it
from so far away?!

309
00:24:07.691 --> 00:24:09.351
On the next Conan--

310
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:12.881
The Illustrator Murder Case.

311
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:18.687
Next Conan's hint:
Contact Lens Set.
