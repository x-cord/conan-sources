1
00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.199
Anniversary.

2
00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:04.199
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:05.699
This never happened before.

4
00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:09.099
Ran explodes at her mother who takes off her wedding ring.

5
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.499
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:11.999
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.199
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.365
Ms. Kuriyama, please answer the door.

9
00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:44.765
Ms. Kuriyama.

10
00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.765
Ms. Kuriyama...

11
00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.065
That's right.

12
00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:51.765
She's out doing an errand for me.

13
00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:01.565
Yes!

14
00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:04.765
But who could it be, so early in the morning?

15
00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.565
Huh?

16
00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.565
Congratulations! Mother!

17
00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:16.965
Ran?

18
00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:19.065
And Conan, you too?

19
00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:24.965
Well? Congratulations for what?

20
00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:27.365
Don't tell me you forgot?

21
00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:29.265
It's your anniversary.

22
00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:31.365
Anniversary?

23
00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:33.465
It's not my birthday.

24
00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:34.765
Not that.

25
00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:36.865
Today is your... Remember, remember...

26
00:03:36.865 --> 00:03:39.665
Today is the day you and dad dated for the first time.

27
00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.965
It's the anniversary of your first date!

28
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:47.265
What's with the excitement?

29
00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.365
I was cleaning up the bookshelf last night

30
00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:51.865
and found an old album.

31
00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.165
Other than the pictures,

32
00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:55.965
I found a lot of things handwritten by you, mom.

33
00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:58.565
First hand-made dish anniversary.

34
00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:01.065
First argument anniversary.

35
00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:03.965
Dad's first successful job anniversary.

36
00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:05.965
Right, Conan?

37
00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:07.965
Oh, yeah.

38
00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:11.465
I guess you could call it the indiscretions of youth.

39
00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:13.865
So as your daughter,

40
00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:16.465
I thought I should congratulate you on this anniversary.

41
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.565
Sorry.

42
00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:21.965
I'm afraid I just don't happen to be in the mood

43
00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:24.465
to linger on the memory of such an old mildewed story of the past.

44
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:33.365
"Attorney Eri Kisaki Falls in Love"

45
00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:38.765
And next time,

46
00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:41.765
please don't bring me flowers again.

47
00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:44.265
Because he'll eat them.

48
00:04:44.265 --> 00:04:48.565
There seems to be flowers that are poisonous to cats.

49
00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:50.465
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:50.465 --> 00:04:53.565
Then I guess I'll decorate them in the bathroom here.

51
00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:56.065
Let's see...

52
00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:59.765
A flower vase...

53
00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.465
Will you get that vase for me, Conan?

54
00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:07.665
Okay.

55
00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:11.065
Here goes.

56
00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:14.365
No, not this.

57
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.365
Can you use the flower vase that's on the shelf?

58
00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.265
Okay.

59
00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:22.265
Hey...

60
00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:25.265
Are you angry about something?

61
00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:26.565
Huh?

62
00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:28.565
No, I'm not.

63
00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:31.565
But you seem a bit annoyed since we came here.

64
00:05:40.665 --> 00:05:42.365
Hello.

65
00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:44.265
This is the Kisaki Law Office.

66
00:05:46.065 --> 00:05:48.265
What? Right now?

67
00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:51.965
Yes, I don't mind.

68
00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:54.065
Thank you very much!

69
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:55.765
I'll be right over then.

70
00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:57.565
Yes. Yes.

71
00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:00.765
I'm sorry, Ran.

72
00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:02.765
I'm going out for a while.

73
00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:11.565
Please take care of Goro for me, okay?

74
00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:13.565
It's just about time for him to use the litterbox.

75
00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:20.165
I'm sure Ms. Kuriyama will be back soon, too.

76
00:06:26.165 --> 00:06:27.565
I wonder who it was?

77
00:06:27.565 --> 00:06:29.265
The person who called her on the phone.

78
00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:31.465
I don't know.

79
00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:34.765
Maybe it's some lawyer that she owes something to?

80
00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.265
Oh, hey! Don't go in there!

81
00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:48.465
Don't go in there, kitty.

82
00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:51.465
Huh? A picture?

83
00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:53.765
It must've been inside this vase.

84
00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:01.165
I wonder who's the man in the picture with mom.

85
00:07:03.265 --> 00:07:06.665
He must be the one who just called her a while ago.

86
00:07:06.665 --> 00:07:09.165
Huh? Why do you say that?

87
00:07:09.165 --> 00:07:12.165
There's a phone number written in back of the picture, right?

88
00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:19.365
It's the same phone number in the calls history list.

89
00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:24.365
But this man sure doesn't look like a lawyer

90
00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:28.265
that she owes something to, does he?

91
00:07:30.065 --> 00:07:31.365
I guess not.

92
00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:36.365
It couldn't be that mother was hiding this picture,

93
00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:39.265
that's why she didn't want me to use this vase, could it?

94
00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:42.165
I think your imagination is getting the better of you.

95
00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:44.865
But there's only trash inside!

96
00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:47.365
I'm sure she set it up, so if I looked in here,

97
00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:49.165
she could claim it was a waste paper basket.

98
00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:54.265
Her wedding ring.

99
00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:58.565
Come to think of it, she wasn't wearing her ring.

100
00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:05.465
Which means that maybe...

101
00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:08.265
She's having an affair?

102
00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:11.165
Let's go after her, Conan!

103
00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:14.765
I think we can still make it if we go now!

104
00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:16.265
Huh?

105
00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.065
I'm back.

106
00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:24.865
Huh?

107
00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.765
Ms. Kisaki? Ms. Kisaki?

108
00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:31.665
The vase is on the floor

109
00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:34.065
and trash is scattered,

110
00:08:34.065 --> 00:08:37.165
and a mysterious bouquet of flowers.

111
00:08:38.565 --> 00:08:40.765
I smell a case.

112
00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:46.065
I guess not.

113
00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:57.165
All right.

114
00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:58.165
Conan!

115
00:08:58.165 --> 00:09:00.665
Yeah. I'll be right there!

116
00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:08.465
There she is!

117
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.065
There's no doubt about it.

118
00:09:10.065 --> 00:09:12.765
It's that guy...

119
00:09:12.765 --> 00:09:14.065
Ran.

120
00:09:17.065 --> 00:09:19.765
Welcome. A table for two?

121
00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:21.365
Oh, yes.

122
00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.665
But why?

123
00:09:28.665 --> 00:09:30.365
Why would mother...

124
00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:34.665
There's no use thinking.

125
00:09:34.665 --> 00:09:36.865
I'll go ask her directly.

126
00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:39.665
Why don't you wait and see?

127
00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.565
We don't know if he's a bad guy or not.

128
00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:45.465
Well, that's true...

129
00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:51.865
Meg.

130
00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:54.065
You're as beautiful as ever, sweechi.

131
00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:57.065
Thank you!

132
00:09:57.065 --> 00:09:58.765
Sweechi?

133
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.665
What's with the baby talk?

134
00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:05.165
But he doesn't look like her love mate.

135
00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:08.465
I don't think he is Ms. Kisaki's type.

136
00:10:08.465 --> 00:10:11.565
But Dad also does that when he gets drunk.

137
00:10:11.565 --> 00:10:16.365
"Ran, sweechi. Could you get me another drinky?"

138
00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.665
I mean, he baby talks a lot.

139
00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:22.165
And everyone knows that dad likes women.

140
00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:25.965
So although very unlikely, he could be mom's type.

141
00:10:29.965 --> 00:10:31.065
Look, Conan!

142
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:34.665
Look at the guy's arm.

143
00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.565
It's full of scratches.

144
00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:40.465
I guess he's not that much of a good person after all.

145
00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:42.565
Oh, hey.

146
00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:48.265
Mom.

147
00:10:48.265 --> 00:10:50.265
She's shaking?

148
00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:52.165
The shaking...

149
00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:54.665
No matter what I do,

150
00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:56.165
the shaking won't stop.

151
00:10:58.565 --> 00:11:00.265
She's crying.

152
00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:04.765
Mom rarely ever sheds tears.

153
00:11:07.765 --> 00:11:09.965
Why would she...

154
00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:12.265
cry over a womanizer, baby talker like him?

155
00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:14.365
Why him?

156
00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:17.365
Wait a second.

157
00:11:17.365 --> 00:11:21.265
The picture, trash and ring that were hidden in the vase,

158
00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:24.265
the impulsive baby talk,

159
00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:26.865
the many scratches on his arm,

160
00:11:26.865 --> 00:11:30.365
and the words that came out with tears,

161
00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:31.865
"The shaking won't stop."

162
00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:36.665
How can I...

163
00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:38.165
Don't worry.

164
00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:41.465
I'm sure it's just a dream.

165
00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:43.665
It's all just a dream.

166
00:11:43.665 --> 00:11:45.465
Huh?

167
00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:49.665
So after seducing mom and making her cry,

168
00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:51.965
he's convincing her that it was just a dream and dumping her!

169
00:11:52.965 --> 00:11:54.865
I won't forgive him.

170
00:11:54.865 --> 00:11:59.865
I'll never forgive that guy!

171
00:12:11.574 --> 00:12:14.874
I see. So that's what it was.

172
00:12:14.874 --> 00:12:18.674
If my deduction is correct, that guy is...

173
00:12:18.674 --> 00:12:20.674
From the way he baby talks,

174
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:24.174
the many scratches on his arms

175
00:12:24.174 --> 00:12:27.174
and the fact that she's meeting him at a place like this.

176
00:12:27.174 --> 00:12:32.974
Her shedding tears in front of him saying, "The shaking won't stop."

177
00:12:32.974 --> 00:12:35.674
And the reply he gave her.

178
00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:39.674
Don't worry. I'm sure it's just a dream.

179
00:12:39.674 --> 00:12:41.874
It's all just a dream.

180
00:12:41.874 --> 00:12:45.674
Everything falls into place.

181
00:12:45.674 --> 00:12:49.374
The reason the wedding ring along with the crumpled papers

182
00:12:49.374 --> 00:12:53.874
was found inside the flower vase was probably...

183
00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.974
Ran, it's a mistake.

184
00:12:57.974 --> 00:13:00.774
That guy is not having an affair with your mother.

185
00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:04.874
I won't forgive him.

186
00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:08.074
That guy, never...

187
00:13:22.674 --> 00:13:24.274
Shoots!

188
00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:26.174
-Huh? -Huh?

189
00:13:26.174 --> 00:13:27.874
You've got it all wrong!

190
00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:28.874
Ran?

191
00:13:32.074 --> 00:13:33.174
That guy is...

192
00:13:34.374 --> 00:13:35.974
He's just a vet!

193
00:13:38.674 --> 00:13:39.974
A vet?

194
00:13:41.574 --> 00:13:45.474
This baby talk womanizer?

195
00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:48.574
I don't think he's a womanizer.

196
00:13:48.574 --> 00:13:52.974
But he was making passes to the woman just a while ago!

197
00:13:52.974 --> 00:13:56.074
Meg. You're as beautiful as ever, sweechi.

198
00:13:56.074 --> 00:13:57.174
Right?

199
00:13:57.174 --> 00:13:59.574
He wasn't saying that to the lady,

200
00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:03.774
but to the dog she was carrying.

201
00:14:03.774 --> 00:14:10.274
They say there are many vets who baby talk when examining animals.

202
00:14:10.274 --> 00:14:12.674
I think he just talked that way impulsively?

203
00:14:12.674 --> 00:14:15.074
Isn't that right, sir?

204
00:14:15.074 --> 00:14:16.374
Yeah.

205
00:14:16.374 --> 00:14:20.974
By the way, the scratches on his arms were made by animals.

206
00:14:20.974 --> 00:14:24.574
Not all animals are quiet when they're being examined.

207
00:14:25.774 --> 00:14:29.474
Besides, he was also flipping over the dog's ear.

208
00:14:29.474 --> 00:14:30.974
Ear?

209
00:14:30.974 --> 00:14:32.374
Yeah.

210
00:14:32.374 --> 00:14:34.574
He was checking the inside of the ear

211
00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:38.574
and smelling it to see if the dog was sick or not.

212
00:14:38.574 --> 00:14:40.574
That's how I figured it out.

213
00:14:40.574 --> 00:14:43.374
Only a vet does something like that.

214
00:14:46.774 --> 00:14:50.474
I heard them saying that on a special program of vets on TV.

215
00:14:50.474 --> 00:14:54.174
But you were crying, mom.

216
00:14:54.174 --> 00:14:56.174
You said you couldn't stop shaking.

217
00:14:56.174 --> 00:14:58.574
You were also shedding tears.

218
00:14:58.574 --> 00:15:01.974
And he answered that it was a dream or something to that effect.

219
00:15:01.974 --> 00:15:04.474
How silly.

220
00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:09.174
I was talking about Goro, not me.

221
00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:10.674
Goro?

222
00:15:10.674 --> 00:15:16.274
Goro suddenly began twitching in his sleep.

223
00:15:16.274 --> 00:15:18.174
The twitching wouldn't stop for some time.

224
00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:22.574
The cats I had before have never acted like that.

225
00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:26.974
I was worried sick that it might be some kind of illness.

226
00:15:26.974 --> 00:15:30.574
That's why I came to talk it over with Dr. Tobe.

227
00:15:30.574 --> 00:15:32.174
I was so busy with work

228
00:15:32.174 --> 00:15:35.274
and couldn't make it while his clinic was open,

229
00:15:35.274 --> 00:15:40.574
so I called to ask him if he could somehow make time for me somewhere.

230
00:15:40.574 --> 00:15:43.974
And today he returned my call.

231
00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:46.474
He told me there's a dog cafe that he visits every morning.

232
00:15:46.474 --> 00:15:49.574
He would like to hear my concern out here.

233
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:53.574
You mean that was the call you got when we were at your office?

234
00:15:53.574 --> 00:15:55.374
Yes.

235
00:15:55.374 --> 00:15:57.474
I wanted to bring Goro here with me

236
00:15:57.474 --> 00:16:00.374
and have Dr. Tobe examine him directly.

237
00:16:00.374 --> 00:16:03.474
But since this is a dog cafe...

238
00:16:03.474 --> 00:16:06.374
Then the dream was...

239
00:16:06.374 --> 00:16:09.174
It is the cause of the shaking.

240
00:16:09.174 --> 00:16:11.174
It happens sometimes.

241
00:16:11.174 --> 00:16:13.174
Some cats dream that they are playing in their sleep

242
00:16:13.174 --> 00:16:17.174
and twitch because their nerves react.

243
00:16:17.174 --> 00:16:21.474
Remember? Pops usually flings his arms up in joy when sleeping.

244
00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:22.774
It's the same thing.

245
00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:24.974
There it comes! It's a dark horse!

246
00:16:26.074 --> 00:16:28.074
Cats do stuff like that, too?

247
00:16:28.074 --> 00:16:32.374
Yeah, cats and humans are alike in that aspect.

248
00:16:32.374 --> 00:16:33.874
They talk in their sleep, too.

249
00:16:35.774 --> 00:16:39.474
So, I don't think there's anything to worry about, Mrs. Mouri.

250
00:16:39.474 --> 00:16:42.374
I see. I'm glad.

251
00:16:42.374 --> 00:16:43.774
Really.

252
00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:46.374
But, mom, how terrible!

253
00:16:46.374 --> 00:16:49.974
How could you throw your wedding ring in the trash?

254
00:16:49.974 --> 00:16:51.474
Trash?

255
00:16:51.474 --> 00:16:54.274
The vase that I tried to put the flowers in this morning

256
00:16:54.274 --> 00:16:56.874
and you told me not to.

257
00:16:56.874 --> 00:17:01.974
I found it thrown away along with crumpled paper after you left.

258
00:17:01.974 --> 00:17:05.474
I thought I lost it somewhere,

259
00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:08.874
but that's where it was.

260
00:17:08.874 --> 00:17:11.374
You mean you didn't put it in there?

261
00:17:11.374 --> 00:17:13.974
That's Goro's toy box.

262
00:17:13.974 --> 00:17:17.074
Those crumpled piece of papers are Goro's toy.

263
00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:19.674
He plays soccer with them.

264
00:17:19.674 --> 00:17:21.574
He's such a good boy

265
00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:25.274
that he puts everything inside that vase after he finishes playing.

266
00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:28.274
I did see him playing with that ring once.

267
00:17:28.274 --> 00:17:30.774
He must've found it on the desk or something

268
00:17:30.774 --> 00:17:32.974
and put it away together with the other things.

269
00:17:32.974 --> 00:17:36.574
He put Dr. Tobe's picture in there, too.

270
00:17:36.574 --> 00:17:40.774
So you weren't the one who hid it there.

271
00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:43.674
I see.

272
00:17:43.674 --> 00:17:44.974
You thought that I hid the ring

273
00:17:44.974 --> 00:17:48.774
and was seeing a man you didn't know.

274
00:17:49.774 --> 00:17:52.574
You thought I was having an affair?

275
00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.574
Yeah.

276
00:17:56.574 --> 00:18:00.674
Well, you looked sort of annoyed before you left.

277
00:18:00.674 --> 00:18:03.874
But after the phone call, you went out looking happy.

278
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.774
I couldn't help it.

279
00:18:05.774 --> 00:18:08.374
I was worried about Goro

280
00:18:08.374 --> 00:18:12.674
and I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to make you worry.

281
00:18:14.774 --> 00:18:18.374
Now that you know what's going on, go home!

282
00:18:18.374 --> 00:18:22.774
You're going to the karate club camp this afternoon, right?

283
00:18:22.774 --> 00:18:24.374
Oh, right.

284
00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:27.274
She's scary.

285
00:18:32.774 --> 00:18:35.174
Nice meeting you. Goodbye!

286
00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:37.174
Conan!

287
00:18:37.174 --> 00:18:38.274
Let's go!

288
00:18:40.574 --> 00:18:42.174
Thank you.

289
00:18:43.874 --> 00:18:45.274
Goodness.

290
00:18:45.274 --> 00:18:47.274
But too bad.

291
00:18:49.074 --> 00:18:53.574
I was kind of expecting a kind of...

292
00:18:53.574 --> 00:18:56.674
love affair, you know?

293
00:18:56.674 --> 00:18:58.074
Huh?

294
00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:04.274
What's the matter?

295
00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:09.074
Something about how mom's acting today bothers me.

296
00:19:09.074 --> 00:19:12.674
She doesn't seem to be her usual self.

297
00:19:12.674 --> 00:19:15.974
Like she said, that's because she was worried about Goro.

298
00:19:15.974 --> 00:19:18.574
No, that's not it.

299
00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:20.674
She just didn't seem to be herself.

300
00:19:26.074 --> 00:19:27.374
So...

301
00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:30.874
That outfit you're wearing with the chest part being open like that.

302
00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:34.574
You usually don't dress like that.

303
00:19:34.574 --> 00:19:37.474
I thought that maybe you were using your cat

304
00:19:37.474 --> 00:19:40.774
as an excuse to come to see me.

305
00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:47.174
You know that I'm hurt over having separated from my wife last year.

306
00:19:49.174 --> 00:19:50.374
Am I wrong?

307
00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:52.174
Oh, well...

308
00:19:52.174 --> 00:19:54.974
That's not really...

309
00:19:54.974 --> 00:19:57.174
That's right! It's what she was wearing!

310
00:19:57.174 --> 00:20:01.174
She usually doesn't wear something provocative like that.

311
00:20:02.874 --> 00:20:06.674
I'm sure that mom did have some feelings for him after all.

312
00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.174
Oh, wait.

313
00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:10.574
I'm going back to that cafe again!

314
00:20:10.574 --> 00:20:11.874
Ran!

315
00:20:13.974 --> 00:20:14.974
Why did we go there?

316
00:20:14.974 --> 00:20:16.774
Huh?

317
00:20:16.774 --> 00:20:18.874
Why did we go there?

318
00:20:18.874 --> 00:20:24.674
Look. Why did we go to your mother's office?

319
00:20:24.674 --> 00:20:25.974
Did you forget?

320
00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.074
We were cleaning the bookshelf

321
00:20:28.074 --> 00:20:30.674
and found an old album.

322
00:20:30.674 --> 00:20:33.974
Inside the album, there was a picture of mom and dad

323
00:20:33.974 --> 00:20:35.674
on their first date.

324
00:20:38.774 --> 00:20:40.674
The picture...

325
00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.474
First date anniversary?

326
00:20:44.674 --> 00:20:46.574
You're wearing the same outfit you wore then?

327
00:20:46.574 --> 00:20:49.074
Yes. I'm a bit too old for this already, but...

328
00:20:50.774 --> 00:20:57.074
Today after work and after I had you examine Goro,

329
00:20:57.074 --> 00:21:01.174
I was planning to go to dinner with him.

330
00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:06.974
I figured if I met him wearing this outfit, we could laugh and make up.

331
00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:11.674
Then, why don't you two hurry and get back together again?

332
00:21:11.674 --> 00:21:14.374
It's not all that simple.

333
00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:18.274
Besides, my daughter found out that today was the day,

334
00:21:18.274 --> 00:21:21.874
so I pretended not to care.

335
00:21:21.874 --> 00:21:24.974
I guess I'm going to call off my plan.

336
00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:30.174
What a lucky guy your husband is.

337
00:21:30.174 --> 00:21:33.974
Having you think of him that much.

338
00:21:33.974 --> 00:21:36.274
Thank you.

339
00:21:36.274 --> 00:21:40.274
But I'm sure he's already forgotten.

340
00:21:41.574 --> 00:21:45.374
That nice day is an old memory after all.

341
00:23:12.174 --> 00:23:14.574
Hey, Kogoro!

342
00:23:19.974 --> 00:23:23.674
No good, he's totally wasted.

343
00:23:23.674 --> 00:23:24.874
Strange.

344
00:23:24.874 --> 00:23:29.974
Just until a few minutes ago, he was grumbling and glaring at his phone.

345
00:23:29.974 --> 00:23:33.474
I wonder why he's dressed up like this though.

346
00:23:33.474 --> 00:23:36.374
It's as if he's ready to go on a date or something.

347
00:23:37.474 --> 00:23:40.874
Look at him, all sprawled out.

348
00:23:40.874 --> 00:23:43.374
Gosh. I wonder who he took after.

349
00:23:45.774 --> 00:23:47.174
Really?

350
00:23:47.174 --> 00:23:49.274
I wonder who he took after.

351
00:23:55.474 --> 00:23:58.474
How can I focus on camp now?

352
00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:06.274
"Next Episode"

353
00:24:06.274 --> 00:24:07.774
We need an ambulance right away!

354
00:24:08.674 --> 00:24:10.874
He looks familiar.

355
00:24:10.874 --> 00:24:14.874
Who was the car after at that time? Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?

356
00:24:15.874 --> 00:24:19.774
I wonder if this case is really that simple.

357
00:24:21.374 --> 00:24:24.974
If so, there must be somebody who saw the culprit!

358
00:24:25.774 --> 00:24:31.174
Next Conan, "Bad Luck Grand Prix"

359
00:24:46.974 --> 00:24:49.074
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:49.074 --> 00:24:51.174
"Luck of a bad person"

361
00:24:51.174 --> 00:24:52.674
Detective Conan is not going to be aired again next week.

362
00:24:52.674 --> 00:24:53.974
I wonder if I'm a jinx.

363
00:24:53.974 --> 00:24:55.774
After this break, there will be no break for a consecutive 10 weeks!
