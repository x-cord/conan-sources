1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,006
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,676
Today's stage is a villa!

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,511
A black shadow
beneath a chandelier!

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,555
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,765
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,184
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,408
The Wealthy Daughter
Murder Case (Part 1).

8
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,915
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

9
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,718
Yotsui Reika (24)
Daughter of Yotsui Group President

10
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,846
Happy 24th birthday, Reika!

11
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,515
Thank you, Father!

12
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:28,773
I humbly thank you
all for being here today!

13
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:33,319
May both she and the
Yotsui Group continue to prosper!

14
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,366
Stop eating like a pig!
You're embarrassing me!

15
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,494
Oh, come on! You guys should eat too!

16
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,580
It's not often you see food like this!

17
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,418
Gotta love that vintage wine!

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:55,758
Now then, allow me to
introduce our special guest!

19
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,052
The great Mori Kogoro-sensei!

20
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,140
Could I get a box to go?

21
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,559
It'd be a crime to waste any!

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,935
Mori-san!

23
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,984
- Wow! The modern-day Akechi Kogoro?!
- You're too kind!

24
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:17,905
The truth is, he helped
my daughter just yesterday!

25
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,324
Oh, it was nothing!

26
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,410
What did you do for her?

27
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,621
Just a tough little case.

28
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,582
A tough case?

29
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,626
I heard about that, Detective Mori!

30
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:34,964
You found Miss Reika's dog,
Bubble-chan!

31
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,216
It was nothing!

32
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,679
My name is Ichieda!

33
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,475
It's a real honor to meet you!

34
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,643
You're too kind!

35
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:51,731
Seriously. One look
from those sharp eyes

36
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,318
is all it takes to make
a criminal confess.

37
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,322
The young lady
was wise to choose you.

38
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:03,618
That's enough, you brown-nosers.

39
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,494
Mifune?!

40
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:14,587
I don't know about you, but he seems
like a middle-aged airhead to me.

41
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,671
What was that?!

42
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,380
How rude!

43
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,840
He's good!

44
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,927
Don't you agree?

45
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,136
Yes...

46
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,805
I looked forward to today,

47
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,433
but he's not
quite what I imagined...

48
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,187
How dare you!

49
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,148
Goes to show how childish you are.

50
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,443
Haven't you heard the saying,

51
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,611
"Still waters run deep?"

52
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,281
Playing dumb to catch
an opponent off guard

53
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,910
is a preferred tactic
of all great detectives.

54
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,995
Isn't that right, Mori-san?

55
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,039
Oh! Yeah!

56
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,874
Some tactic.

57
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
She anticipated that very fact.

58
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,338
She's really something.

59
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,800
Not to mention
beautiful and refined!

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,762
I wonder who won her heart?

61
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,100
I dunno, but he's
gonna be one happy guy.

62
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,270
He gets to be the next
head of the Yotsui Group!

63
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,360
Bathroom... Bathroom...

64
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,571
This hallway sure is dark...

65
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,949
Why aren't the lights on?

66
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,575
Here we go.

67
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,871
A closet?

68
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:33,541
Shower room...

69
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,252
Here's the bathroom!

70
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,506
Huh? The lights won't turn on.

71
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,384
What are you doing there?

72
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,885
I need to use the bathroom...

73
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,888
The lights in this
washroom don't work;

74
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,099
use the one across the way.

75
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,059
Okay.

76
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:57,565
But that's odd. None of the
lights around here work.

77
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:02,028
I thought I changed
them all just recently...

78
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,155
Sir!

79
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,825
Your daughter's car has a flat tire!

80
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,576
What?!

81
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,870
What should we do?

82
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,998
Shall I take you home in my Ferrari?

83
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,417
No, I'll take you in my Porsche!

84
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,002
How about my Benz?

85
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,545
Um...

86
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,631
All three of your
cars have flats, too...

87
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,175
- Eh?!
- Eh?!

88
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:29,597
Damn it! They got my car too!

89
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,599
Mine, as well.

90
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,768
Who the hell did this?!

91
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,146
Dad's rental car seems fine.

92
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,855
Yeah.

93
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,734
Six cars have flat tires.

94
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,905
The six of you will
have to share cars with--

95
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,822
No!

96
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,534
Today is my birthday!

97
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:53,329
I refuse to be stuffed
into someone else's car!

98
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,997
Now, now, Reika...

99
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,793
I'm staying here
with Yone tonight!

100
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,003
Come send for me in the morning.

101
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,923
Then I'll stay too.

102
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,007
Me too!

103
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,674
And me!

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,011
Then I, too, will spend
the night and protect her

105
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,388
from these young wolves.

106
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:14,934
Good idea. I can rest
easy with you on the job.

107
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,103
I leave her in your hands.

108
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,896
Very good, sir.

109
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,069
Right this way.

110
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:31,534
Fools. Her husband was
already decided two years ago.

111
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,538
Everyone left?! Then we should go--

112
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,165
We can't! Not until you sober up!

113
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:43,045
Yes! Stay a little longer
and tell us about your cases!

114
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,547
Splendid idea.

115
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:49,218
What do you say we all play cards?

116
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,262
Count me out.

117
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,057
Detective. I'll drive you home.

118
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,268
Gimme your car keys.

119
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,353
Oh, are you leaving?

120
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:04,233
That's a pity. You were
one of my candidate suitors.

121
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,237
I only came here to make sure the deal

122
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:13,159
between my company and
your old man's goes through.

123
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,120
Sorry, but I'm not interested in you.

124
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,038
Hey now, Mifune!

125
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,206
Forget him.

126
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:22,585
Yeah. The fewer rivals the better.

127
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,754
So there you have it, Detective.

128
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:27,173
The key, please.

129
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah...

130
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,096
What was that for?!

131
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,056
If you want to leave, then leave!

132
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:40,436
But you can say goodbye to your deal!

133
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,395
You can't be serious!

134
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,981
Yone. I'm going to change upstairs.

135
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,982
Very good.

136
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,612
You're nothing but caged birds.

137
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,157
You can't survive unless I feed you.

138
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,870
All you can do is
chirp to soothe your owner!

139
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,131
You were all members
of the same yacht club?

140
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:13,093
We used to sail around
nearby islands in her boat!

141
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,888
Those were great times!

142
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,556
They sure were.

143
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,893
Until the accident
two years ago, anyway!

144
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,189
Accident?

145
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,566
It's old news.

146
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,110
We promised never
to talk about it again!

147
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,822
She certainly is taking a long time...

148
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,866
What do you suppose she's doing?

149
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,326
Forget about her.

150
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,745
We don't need her selfish attitude.

151
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:46,210
Hasn't it been a little too long?

152
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,545
Alright, then.

153
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,715
Sorry, but could you
take a look in her room?

154
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,217
Certainly.

155
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,261
I'll go check the other rooms.

156
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,887
Then I'll go, too.

157
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,721
Me too.

158
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,764
Same here.

159
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,141
Reika-sama!

160
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,354
That's strange.
She isn't anywhere.

161
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,899
Maybe she left
and got lost in the forest?

162
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:15,072
Our only choice is to
split up and search the forest.

163
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,117
What a nuisance.

164
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,787
Reika-sama!

165
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,123
Hey! Where are you?!

166
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,875
Reika-san!

167
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,588
Damn, where on earth did she go?!

168
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,802
It's starting to come down!

169
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,220
What now?

170
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,348
Let's go back for now.

171
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:42,266
Okay.

172
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,563
Huh?

173
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,523
Isn't that Nikaido-san?

174
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:54,028
Hey now, this is no time to be napping--

175
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,340
Hey, Nikaido! Hey!

176
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,967
It's no use. He's dead.

177
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,469
What?!

178
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,846
He was drowned.

179
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,893
Someone probably
held his head in this fountain.

180
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,062
You can't be serious!

181
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,731
He was alive just a few minutes ago!

182
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,902
Yes. Meaning he was killed just now

183
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,114
by someone near this lodge!

184
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,117
That's terrible!
Who would do such a thing?!

185
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,496
I can think of someone suspicious.

186
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,583
The missing Reika-sama!

187
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,462
She would never!

188
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,173
No, there's still no telling who.

189
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,677
For all we know, she could be dead too.

190
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,806
For now, let's call the police.

191
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,391
We can talk after that.

192
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,935
Eh? The phones are out?!

193
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,479
Yes, all of them!

194
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,856
How can that be?!

195
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,649
Is this the killer's doing?

196
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,819
I'll use my cell phone!

197
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,614
Don't bother. There's
no phone reception out here.

198
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,535
Our only option now is
to use the detective's car.

199
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,372
Yeah. Someone could
take it and get the police...

200
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,588
Well, now my tires are flat too.

201
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:42,303
Which means someone
wants to keep us here.

202
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,679
What the hell?!

203
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,309
We'll just have to wait
until the cars come tomorrow.

204
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,853
Yone-san. Please make us some coffee.

205
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,937
Certainly.

206
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,065
I'll help you!

207
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,526
Hey, Mifune! Where are you going?

208
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,320
The john.

209
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,738
Then I'll come too.

210
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,031
Me too!

211
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,326
I'll get some towels
from the washroom.

212
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,037
Everyone's dripping wet from the rain.

213
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,455
Thanks.

214
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,501
You sure know this place well, Mister!

215
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,505
We used to come here a lot.

216
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,094
Oh, that's odd.

217
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,346
What is?

218
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,598
I can't find any sugar.

219
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,559
Could you check up there for me?

220
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,936
Sure!

221
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,532
There's none up here...

222
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,869
Oh! Here's some!

223
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,706
I forgot we hoarded
some five years ago!

224
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,543
Is that sugar still any good?

225
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,879
Say, what kind of accident
happened at the yacht club

226
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,297
two years ago?

227
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,885
Don't be stupid.
That's got nothing to do with this.

228
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,014
Before he was killed,
Nikaido-san said that

229
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,309
Reika-sama's husband
was decided two years ago.

230
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,602
What?!

231
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,107
It might have something
to do with this.

232
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,362
Yeah. Looks like
we'll need you to talk

233
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,699
about this accident of yours.

234
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,536
It happened during a storm.
Most unfortunate.

235
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,706
On that day two years ago,

236
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,878
we landed on a small island
and went off on our own.

237
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,171
Little did we know
a storm was coming.

238
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,634
Nearly everyone escaped
back onto the boat,

239
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:50,556
except for Nikaido and Reika-sama.

240
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,270
The island was so small
that the full tide could submerge it.

241
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,191
One of us took
a life raft to rescue her.

242
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:08,532
We found them half a
day later with life vests on,

243
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,201
but the person who went to
get them was never seen again.

244
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,666
Until the drowned body was
found three days later, anyway.

245
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,878
Who was it?!

246
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,547
My granddaughter, Yaeko.

247
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,381
Yone-san!

248
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,011
She sacrificed her life
to rescue Reika-sama.

249
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,597
It was probably worth it to her.

250
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,807
Well, your coffee's ready!

251
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,185
Thank you!

252
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:43,484
At any rate, first we need
to find Reika-sama.

253
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,155
Let's split into two groups
and check the house again.

254
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:53,077
But since one of us could be the killer,

255
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,662
let's make sure
no one gets separated.

256
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,249
Good idea! It's safer
if we watch each other!

257
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,044
We'll start once we're done here.

258
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,716
At a time like this?!

259
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,177
Sorry, I'm suddenly sleepy...

260
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,013
You must be tired
from all that's happened.

261
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:17,017
You can take a nap on this sofa.

262
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,187
I'll stay with you.

263
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,397
Okay...

264
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,856
Find her?

265
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,607
Nope.

266
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,566
How about you?

267
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,734
Not here!

268
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,696
She doesn't seem to be anywhere.

269
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,072
Geez...

270
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,366
Reika-sama!

271
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,368
What're you doing?!

272
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,578
Let's move on.

273
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,542
Reika-sama!

274
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,835
Where'd she disappear to?

275
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,133
Yaeko...

276
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,679
Not in here...

277
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,638
Or in here.

278
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,101
That takes care of the first floor.

279
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,980
She must be in the forest after all...

280
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,482
The power's out.
Did something happen upstairs?!

281
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,942
Where's the circuit breaker?

282
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,360
Across from the kitchen.

283
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,575
What was that?!

284
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,660
It's close by!

285
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,749
Who shut off the power?!

286
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,002
We just got here...

287
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,712
It was the killer.

288
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:33,385
With us checking the house,
they had nowhere to run,

289
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:38,265
so they cut the power
and escaped out this window!

290
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,267
The bastard!

291
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,269
You're not getting away!

292
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,145
Mifune!

293
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,731
Oh no! Stop them!

294
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,489
Damn! Where'd everyone go?!

295
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,453
People often get lost in this forest...

296
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,082
Yone-san!
What are you doing here?!

297
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,377
I followed you
when you scurried outside!

298
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,129
Wait a minute!

299
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,340
That means Ran's all alone!

300
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,012
Who is this person?

301
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,183
Water?

302
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,026
Ran!

303
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,447
Ran!

304
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,034
Hey, Ran! Wake up! Ran!

305
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,208
Shinichi?!

306
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,210
What happened?!

307
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,672
Someone held my head underwater...

308
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,968
But I'm glad you came, Shinichi...

309
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,972
Ran! Ran!

310
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,437
Whew, she's just asleep.
She had me scared!

311
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,150
But that's strange.

312
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,443
This would normally
wake a person up.

313
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,406
Was there sleeping
medicine in her coffee?!

314
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,993
But why Ran?

315
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,621
Huh? Didn't the
old man leave this open?

316
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,500
It's warm. How come?

317
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,212
What? Ran was attacked?!

318
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,424
I think someone
gave her sleeping pills.

319
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,634
Sleeping pills?

320
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,347
It was probably in the coffee.

321
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,477
Didn't you and
Ran make the coffee?

322
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,480
But I would never--

323
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,859
You didn't attack her--

324
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,154
you were in the forest with us.

325
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,617
The fact that she was attacked
just because she was here

326
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,330
means that these might
be random murders!

327
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,755
You were with her when
the power went out, right?

328
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,881
Yes.

329
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,758
Did anything strange happen?

330
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,845
There was a warm breeze,

331
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,224
and then the lights went out...

332
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,601
A breeze?

333
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,728
The air conditioner?!

334
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,694
12:30! That's when
the power went out!

335
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:49,081
All the air conditioners
were set to go on at 12:30!

336
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,543
Now I know how
the killer cut the lights!

337
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,464
The killer is someone
in this mansion!

338
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,385
It's too dangerous
to stay in your room alone!

339
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,388
He's right, Mifune! It's past 4:00!

340
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,265
The cars will
be here in three hours!

341
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:11,103
Ha! I can't stay with you guys

342
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,355
when one of
you might be a killer!

343
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,651
I'll be in my room too.

344
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,613
We'd all be safest together...

345
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,384
It's 7:00...

346
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,262
I'm going to the bathroom...

347
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,097
Then I will too.

348
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,598
Me too.

349
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,394
Here is today's
weather for the Kanto region.

350
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,231
They've been gone a while...

351
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,860
There are three of 'em.

352
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,779
Oh? What's with the coffee?

353
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,241
They made it while
I was in the bathroom.

354
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,326
I thought it would help wake us up.

355
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,081
Don't worry, I didn't drug it!

356
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,126
Hot!

357
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,462
Where's the bathroom?!

358
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,005
Sorry!

359
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,468
It'll leave a stain if we don't hurry--

360
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,456
The two murders
were done the exact same way!

361
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,291
Was it you?

362
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,667
I didn't do it!

363
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,628
Ichieda-san isn't the killer!

364
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,923
Mifune-kun. You did it.

365

367
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,975
