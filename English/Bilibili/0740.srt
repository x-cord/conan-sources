1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,840
Don't tell me that the couple...

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,540
If they were Bourbon and Bellmot...

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,040
If they heard the conversation I had with Jodie...

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,840
At any rate, I have to hurry and meet Ai and confirm.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,340
Darn! Why didn't I notice right away?

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,440
If she said that her husband, Tohei, was also a hostage back then,

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,440
nothing fits into place.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,640
After goofing things up like that...

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,540
Goofing things up?

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,740
This is maybe a trap!

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,340
You're asking if I haven't been sensing the organization lately?

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,840
Yeah.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,340
I mean, you used to say that you smelled something before, didn't you?

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,240
I haven't been sensing them.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
But I wasn't working my antennas out for them either.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
You also told me that the organization already thinks I'm dead.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,740
I see. I guess it's okay then.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,440
What? Don't tell me that they found out that I'm still alive?

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,240
I was just confirming, just confirming!

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Sorry for calling you so late.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,440
"Ai Haibara"

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,740
Keep cool, keep calm. That's the way to go.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,240
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,140
are slashed by the light of deduction.

25
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,740
While investigating with Sera, Ran collapses to the floor.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,840
What on earth has happened?

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,840
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:21,627
"The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 1)".

31
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:26,727
Hey, Conan.

32
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,827
Conan!

33
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:33,827
What is it?

34
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,627
What do you mean what?

35
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,627
All you've been doing for a while is looking around.

36
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,427
Is there anybody suspicious around?

37
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:41,827
Don't let it bother you.

38
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,427
It's nothing.

39
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:44,827
Really?

40
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,627
Shoots.

41
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,527
Ever since then, I keep feeling like someone's watching.

42
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:55,927
I already told Jodie that I thought that the couple

43
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,227
was a member of the organization of the men in black

44
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:03,227
but if they noticed what happened...

45
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,227
Cool it. Everything'll be fine.

46
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:07,527
Everything's still okay.

47
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,927
Are you feeling sick or something, Conan?

48
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,627
You're perspiring profusely.

49
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:21,827
I'm planning to eat lunch with Mom at Chinatown after this

50
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,827
but would you like to call it off and go home?

51
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,027
I'm fine!

52
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,927
I was just thinking of something.

53
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,427
Really?

54
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:33,027
I have this hard homework to figure out, you see.

55
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:37,827
The sound of a shutter?

56
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,427
I'm not just imagining things!

57
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:47,727
Just as I thought.

58
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,527
Somebody's watching me after all.

59
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,127
But, who on earth could it be?

60
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,227
Why?

61
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,527
Again! It's closer than before!

62
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:57,727
Where's it coming from?

63
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,227
Where's the picture being taken from?

64
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,127
Hey, hi you guys!

65
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,427
What're you doing in a place like this?

66
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,427
Masumi, what brings you here?

67
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,427
I'm here on work.

68
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:16,427
Do you know about a girl called Keiko Kitao that's in Class A next door?

69
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,627
You mean Kei?

70
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,327
I was introduced to her older sister by her.

71
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,827
And her older sister asked me to find something out for her.

72
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,627
See.

73
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,627
She's sitting in that chair over there.

74
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,527
"Rumi Kitao (21), University student" -Ms. Rumi Kitao,

75
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,327
a junior in university.

76
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:32,327
And the man sitting next to her is

77
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,727
"Kenya Settsu (22), University student" -Mr. Kenya Settsu,

78
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:36,127
a senior in university.

79
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,727
They've been going with each other from about six months ago, you see.

80
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:43,827
She wants to introduce him to her parents as her fiance,

81
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,127
but rumor has it that he's a playboy.

82
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,427
And besides, she suspects

83
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:50,427
that he hasn't broken off with his ex-girlfriend yet.

84
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:55,627
That's what I was checking!

85
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:58,227
So, she's doing a "is he having other affairs" check, huh?

86
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,427
And? How about it?

87
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,927
I guess you could say, things are gray for now.

88
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,327
It seems that he hasn't returned

89
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,327
the spare key to his ex-girlfriend's room yet.

90
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:10,827
This is his ex-girlfriend's condo too.

91
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:14,727
But is it okay for you to be telling us something like that?

92
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,427
Don't worry about it!

93
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,527
You guys aren't blabbermouths, are you?

94
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:23,427
And, by the way, what're you guys doing?

95
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,327
This is the Kanagawa prefecture, you know.

96
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:28,227
My mom's client who lives in this condo

97
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,427
is talking things over with her right now.

98
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,427
After she's finished with that,

99
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:34,027
we were supposed to go have a meal with her.

100
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:37,827
It's from Mom.

101
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:42,127
No joke, you mean you can't come?

102
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,827
But I'm already starved.

103
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:48,527
I'm sorry. The talk's going to take a while longer.

104
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:49,927
If you're hungry,

105
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,327
go ahead with Conan and get yourselves something to eat.

106
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,927
I'll meet you again at sundown in this lobby, okay?

107
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,427
Okay.

108
00:06:57,427 --> 00:07:00,427
Maybe we should get some rice balls or something nearby.

109
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:04,127
Why don't you have them treat you guys to something then?

110
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:08,527
It seems that they're having a lunch date with his ex-girl today, you see.

111
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,427
You got to be kidding.

112
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:12,527
We've never even met them.

113
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,427
This is an undercover investigation, you know.

114
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:16,627
Undercover?

115
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,927
For the sake of Keiko of Class A.

116
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,627
No joke.

117
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:24,827
Isn't your younger sister coming later?

118
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,527
It was really difficult

119
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,627
to get a reservation for your younger sister

120
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:31,027
being that the restaurant is quite famous.

121
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,727
It can't be helped.

122
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:35,527
She said she suddenly had to attend to an urgent business of her friend.

123
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:39,627
What's this? Don't tell me you're going after my sister?

124
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,827
No! I just thought that with your younger sister around,

125
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:44,227
the atmosphere would be a bit more comfortable.

126
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:45,327
I mean, today,

127
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:48,427
we're eating together so that Waka and I can smooth things out, right?

128
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:52,427
I haven't talked to her since we broke up, you see.

129
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:53,727
I guess so.

130
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,727
I'm sure that Mr. Kaga who'll be coming later

131
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,327
will help keep the atmosphere exciting.

132
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,627
Excuse me.

133
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:03,327
Are you by chance, Kei's older sister?

134
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,227
Yes.

135
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:10,127
I'm Ran Mouri who used to be in the same class as her last year.

136
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,927
Since she's showed me a picture of you several time before,

137
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,927
I thought that you may be...

138
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,027
Oh, is that so?

139
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,827
What a coincidence.

140
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,227
The fact is,

141
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:27,227
I was supposed to join you for a meal in place of Keiko of Class A today.

142
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:30,027
If that man is a playboy as he's rumored to be,

143
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:31,827
I figured he'd sneakily try to give me the eye

144
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,727
when he thinks she's not watching.

145
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,527
But you've got a way better figure than me and you're also much cuter.

146
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,727
So, won't you please play the role for me?

147
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,427
If he's really that kind of guy,

148
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm sure that he'll jump at the bait as soon as it's laid out before him.

149
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,227
Okay. I'll just sprinkle a bit of bait to begin with.

150
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,927
So...

151
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,927
Conan, I know you're hungry

152
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:06,027
but you haven't decided what you want to eat yet, have you?

153
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,027
No.

154
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,027
You're so obvious.

155
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,427
Why don't you come and eat with us then?

156
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,527
One child more is no big deal.

157
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,927
Thank you so very much.

158
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:21,727
Talk about an easy catch.

159
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,227
Good job.

160
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:29,427
Waka sure is late, isn't she?

161
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:31,427
It's after noon time already.

162
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:33,427
It can't be helped.

163
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,827
She was drinking till 05:00 this morning, you know.

164
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:37,927
"Mitsuaki Kaga (22), University student" -I'm sure she still sleeping.

165
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:40,627
There you are, Kaga!

166
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:43,127
Was there a restroom in this lobby?

167
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:46,127
Yeah. It's on the other side of the elevator.

168
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,827
I guess I'll go use the john then.

169
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:52,427
If so, I'll go see on Waka.

170
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,227
If you're going to Waka's room...

171
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,927
Can you give this spare key back to her?

172
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:02,327
I don't need it anymore, you see.

173
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:03,727
Kenya...

174
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:09,027
Hey, hey, don't drop it.

175
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,527
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,227
And, he's left all alone with Ran.

177
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:15,827
If he's going to reveal his real self,

178
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:18,427
this'll be the time.

179
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:21,527
Sorry, but can you go with her?

180
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:26,027
If Waka' not sober yet,

181
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:29,127
she may bite at Rumi, you see.

182
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,527
True.

183
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:35,727
I'm the one who took Waka's boyfriend.

184
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,327
If somebody who she doesn't know is with me,

185
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:39,727
maybe Waka will be a bit calmer.

186
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,627
I don't mind.

187
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:44,427
Okay, then please come with me.

188
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:45,727
Yes.

189
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:53,527
It could be that she just suddenly felt like not wanting to see me again

190
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,827
and is just cooped up in her room.

191
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:58,027
If so, won't you tell her that I'd like to see her personally

192
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,327
and apologize for a lot of things.

193
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,327
He's got more...

194
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:08,027
-common sense than I thought. -Common sense than I thought.

195
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:11,027
"Hashitani"

196
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,427
There's no answer.

197
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:19,027
I wonder if she's still sleeping after all.

198
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:22,127
Then, maybe I should use this.

199
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,627
Waka?

200
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,227
Are you asleep?

201
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,727
I'm sorry, it's a call.

202
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:36,227
I'm sorry, but can you go wake Waka up?

203
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:37,527
"Kenya Settsu"

204
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,927
When she comes home drunk,

205
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,227
Waka has a habit of sleeping in weird places, you see.

206
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,927
Please look inside the closet and other places too, okay?

207
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:51,427
Okay.

208
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:54,727
Sorry to keep you waiting.

209
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,527
Is the connection unclear?

210
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,627
I'll be out on the veranda, then.

211
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:04,327
Waka? Are you there?

212
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,427
Waka?

213
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,427
Waka?

214
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,027
What shall I do?

215
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,827
She's nowhere in sight.

216
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,327
The bathtub room?

217
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:23,627
I'm Rumi's younger sister's friend

218
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:26,527
and I was told to come and get you, Waka.

219
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,927
Waka?

220
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:34,727
Are you all right?

221
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:37,627
Waka?

222
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:43,127
Please get a hold of yourself! Waka!

223
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,527
Waka...

224
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:02,261
Ran.

225
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,761
Ran, wake up!

226
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,961
Ran! Ran!

227
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,161
Conan.

228
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,261
I'm glad! You're back.

229
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,561
Are you okay?

230
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,561
I'm sorry for all this.

231
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,861
Masumi.

232
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,761
What happened to me?

233
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,561
Ouch.

234
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:25,061
You were collapsed in the bathroom.

235
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:30,261
It's terrible! I found Waka in the bathroom floor bleeding!

236
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:32,861
Yeah. So, see.

237
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,461
The police are here now and investigating.

238
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,261
What happened?

239
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:43,461
I heard the sound of the shower coming from the bathroom.

240
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:47,561
I went inside and found Waka inside the steam.

241
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,261
I tried to carry her up

242
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,661
but I suddenly felt faint.

243
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:53,761
Didn't you see anybody suspicious?

244
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,161
Nope.

245
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,661
I searched in the closet too,

246
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,361
but found nobody.

247
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:01,061
Why the closet?

248
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:05,061
Waka has a habit of sleeping in strange places when she comes back drunk.

249
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,561
Rumi who was with me told me so...

250
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,961
Come to think of it, what about Rumi?

251
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,661
I'm fine.

252
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:16,361
I'm sorry I got you messed up in something terrible like this.

253
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,661
Rumi!

254
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:18,961
Unfortunately,

255
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:24,161
I fainted in the bathroom too after finding you and Waka.

256
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,061
I didn't see the culprit though.

257
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:30,061
Kenya, you and the others came to look for us

258
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,261
because we didn't return for quite a while, right?

259
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,661
Yeah.

260
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:36,461
You weren't back even after 30 minutes,

261
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,361
so I called you on the cell but got no answer either.

262
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,161
We told the manager of this condo what happened

263
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,961
and had him open the door for us.

264
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:45,661
-Right? -Yeah.

265
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:49,561
Then, we found all three of you collapsed on the floor.

266
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:52,861
We rushed and called the police.

267
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,461
But, what was that smell?

268
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,861
I felt faint at the bathtub.

269
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,961
Chloroform.

270
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,461
It's a kind of anesthesia

271
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:09,161
and if a lot is inhaled, you pass out.

272
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,861
There are cases when it can kill you too.

273
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,861
It evaporated in the bathtub and filled the entire room.

274
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:21,361
Well, this boy turned on the ventilation right away,

275
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:24,261
so it's all right now.

276
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,761
So, the anesthesia got to Waka...

277
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:30,361
Can't you see for yourself?

278
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,561
She was slugged to death!

279
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:37,261
She was hit on the head with a blunt object and killed.

280
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:40,561
But, why was the anesthesia used?

281
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,461
Besides, is the one who's dead really Waka?

282
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:46,161
We can't see her face through that facial pack.

283
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:49,161
Then, please confirm it, will you?

284
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,161
Waka!

285
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,561
Watch it!

286
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,261
Don't go inside.

287
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:01,461
Talk about a strange corpse.

288
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,261
She's winking.

289
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,161
Besides,

290
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:07,561
something's dripping out from the corner of her eye.

291
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,061
Mascara?

292
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,561
At first glance, it looks as if someone struck Waka on the head

293
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:20,761
just as she was getting ready to take a bath.

294
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,761
This may be...

295
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,861
Then, this is what happened?

296
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:33,261
You four had arrangements to have lunch together today.

297
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:38,661
And, you were all going to gather here at the condo of the victim at noon.

298
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:43,061
But, since you got worried that she didn't come down at all,

299
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:46,061
Ran who coincidentally happened to meet Rumi

300
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,961
came to check things out at this room together

301
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,261
but even after the doorbell was rung, there was no answer.

302
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,661
So, you used the spare key

303
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:56,161
that Mr. Settsu who used to go with the victim gave you,

304
00:16:56,161 --> 00:17:00,161
opened the front door and came inside.

305
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,761
Then, at that time,

306
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,561
Mr. Settsu called you, Rumi, on the phone.

307
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:07,861
So, Ran ended up having to go to look for Waka alone.

308
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,961
And found her collapsed on the bathroom floor,

309
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,261
but she collapsed from inhaling the chloroform.

310
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:17,061
Rumi, who came along later, also fell asleep.

311
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,961
Then, 30 minutes later,

312
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:21,061
worried about the two that didn't come back for some time,

313
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:23,161
all of you came up here to check.

314
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,961
As a result, you found the three collapsed on the floor in the bathroom.

315
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:30,261
Yeah, that's about right.

316
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,161
The front door was locked

317
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,761
and we had some difficulty trying to open it,

318
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,261
so reporting to the police was a bit delayed.

319
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,661
I happen to be a worrier,

320
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:42,961
so I have a habit of locking doors no matter where I am.

321
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:45,161
By the way,

322
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:48,861
is it true that the victim was drinking liquor till 05:00 this morning?

323
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,961
Yeah, she was drinking with me in this room, just the two of us.

324
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,961
We invited Settsu and Rumi to come too,

325
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,361
but they didn't come saying they'd be seeing us tomorrow anyway.

326
00:17:56,361 --> 00:18:00,361
I had to listen to a load of stink talk about her ex-boyfriend, Settsu,

327
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,861
until she fell asleep wasted.

328
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:05,161
Then, what about the key to the front door?

329
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,861
Of course,

330
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,761
I woke Waka up before I left

331
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,561
and made her lock the door.

332
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,361
But this sure is a fine condo to be living alone in.

333
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:20,961
Waka's father is an executive of a famous company, you see.

334
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:24,461
Well, the only one who wasn't surprised at seeing this room

335
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:28,461
was a freshman who entered our circle this year.

336
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:29,761
Her father

337
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,361
seems to be the chairman of a company affiliated to Waka's father's.

338
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,361
Hey.

339
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:39,361
When you came in here with Ran using the spare key,

340
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,961
Mr. Settsu seems to have called you,

341
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,661
but what did he call you for?

342
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:45,861
He asked me to look for something for him.

343
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:50,161
He forgot something here when he was going with Waka.

344
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:53,161
He asked me to look for it and bring to him.

345
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,661
Well, he asked me for it before,

346
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:58,661
so I was going to bring it to him even without the phone call, though.

347
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:00,861
What did you forget?

348
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:04,361
A wristwatch. It was my favorite.

349
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:08,561
I thought I left it somewhere in the living room, you see.

350
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:11,061
If Waka was still asleep,

351
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:12,161
I was going to ask her to go in with the spare key

352
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:15,961
and secretly retrieve it.

353
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:18,161
It seems that she couldn't find it,

354
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,861
so Waka may have found it and got rid of it.

355
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:25,561
The living room is the large room where the veranda is, right?

356
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,261
Yes.

357
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:30,061
I got the call and went out to the veranda,

358
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,361
so it was great timing for me to look for it, but...

359
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,661
Since this is a skyscraper,

360
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:37,661
unless I go out to the veranda, the connection is bad, you see.

361
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:41,361
That's why I asked you to go look for Waka.

362
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:42,461
Yes.

363
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:45,761
Which means...

364
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:49,561
Rumi went in from the front door over to the living room to the left

365
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:53,661
and Ran went to look on the right side where the bedroom is.

366
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:55,761
Talking of the veranda,

367
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,961
there were times when Waka came home drunk

368
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,061
and slept on the veranda too, right?

369
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,961
Yeah, I heard about that some time ago.

370
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,261
She was really wasted and called me

371
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:09,461
saying that she was trying to sober up by getting some breeze.

372
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:12,261
But, she fell asleep on me on the phone.

373
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,961
I got worried and came to check,

374
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,761
and found her leaning against the veranda fast asleep.

375
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:19,161
There were times when she fell asleep under the bed too.

376
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:21,361
But this time,

377
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:23,961
she didn't sleep on the veranda or under the bed,

378
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:27,661
but was sleeping in the bathroom as a corpse.

379
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,761
And the person who did this to her

380
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,561
is the one who had the key to this room.

381
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:39,461
In other words, one of you two.

382
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,361
-Hey! -Hold it.

383
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:44,261
Her ex-boyfriend, Settsu had a spare key,

384
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:45,661
but I didn't have any key.

385
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,061
I'll bet you drank with the victim till early in the morning today,

386
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,661
got her wasted

387
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,661
and secretly took the key home with you.

388
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:53,161
As long as you come running over,

389
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:56,561
and throw the key out somewhere here, you could easily deceive everybody.

390
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,661
It's possible that you were here until noon

391
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,761
when you were supposed to meet with everyone else too.

392
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:04,161
If... if it's the key, Rumi may also have had it.

393
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,961
Because until Settsu and Waka started going with each other,

394
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,461
she was room sharing here with Waka.

395
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,861
I returned the key to her long ago!

396
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,461
I see.

397
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:20,261
If there's a possibility that all three of you had the key,

398
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:23,461
all three of you could've committed the crime.

399
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:24,861
No.

400
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:31,561
The only ones who could've killed Waka by the time Ran found her...

401
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:35,161
are Mr. Settsu and Mr. Kaga.

402
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,661
What the...

403
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:44,661
Mr. Kaga came just before Ran and Rumi went to call Waka at her room.

404
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:46,661
Just about 30 minutes before that,

405
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:50,061
Mr. Settsu left to go to the restroom, right?

406
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:54,561
If the two had the key to Waka's room...

407
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:58,061
If you use the stairs where they are no surveillance cameras...

408
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:02,861
it's possible to kill Waka without being seen by anyone.

409
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:06,861
As to that, Rumi was with me right through until we all came here.

410
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,361
She didn't even go to the restroom

411
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:12,961
until we went to Waka's room.

412
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,461
She couldn't have committed the crime.

413
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:16,261
You were with Rumi?

414
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:18,361
Rather, who are you?

415
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:19,461
A detective...

416
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,361
Who was hired by Rumi.

417
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,261
"Next Episode" -At any rate...

418
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,961
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:02,361
Thank you for helping me pick them up!

420
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,661
Here you go.

421
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:05,561
Be careful not to drop it again.

422
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:10,761
If that corpse wasn't Waka,

423
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,361
it would be a different story.

424
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,861
What?

425
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:17,361
Next Conan,

426
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:21,261
"The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 2)".

427
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:38,761
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:41,461
"Wink".

429
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:43,361
-It's almost June. -From May to June.

430
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:45,261
Mascara from the eyes.
