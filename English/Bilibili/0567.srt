1
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,907
I'm tired.

2
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,607
What? Outdoor Spa?

3
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:12,707
Looks like fun to me.

4
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:15,207
Let's give it a try.

5
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,007
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

6
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,107
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

7
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,807
What is the alibi trick that was used?

8
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,607
Taking advantage of the blind-spot?

9
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:28,507
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:30,607
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:33,007
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:23,187
"Murderous Intent Raining on an Outdoor Spa"

13
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:28,987
There's no use in stalling!

14
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,987
"Hideaki Umezu (70)" -Why don't you just hurry up

15
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,487
"Mortgage Company President" -and sign this contract?

16
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,287
"Kouichi Maekawa (50)" -I told you many times

17
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,287
"Hot Springs Park Manager" -that I have no desire to sell this place!

18
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:38,987
What an incapable successor!

19
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:41,187
You seriously think you can gather customers

20
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:42,587
by selling octopuses here?

21
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:45,687
It's because of a certain gargoyle perching over my place

22
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,787
that the customers are being driven away.

23
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,387
Welcome.

24
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:56,287
Be prepared to be disappointed by like this lousy hot spring.

25
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,087
-What? -Why?

26
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:01,387
-Now... -It's all right, just ignore him.

27
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,287
"Mari Ehara (35)" -This happens all the time,

28
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:04,487
"Hideaki's First Daughter" -so don't mind him.

29
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:05,587
"Yasuko Umeza (28)" -That's right.

30
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:08,887
"Hideaki's Second Daughter" -My dad always here to pick fights.

31
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,687
Enough of that! You're all grown up yet all,

32
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:14,087
you can do is mooch off of me.

33
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,587
I'll have you know that you're to be quiet and respect my decisions.

34
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,287
Ouch!

35
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,487
"Shousuke Yagihashi (27)" -The reason our president comes

36
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,387
"Hideaki's Secretary" -to this place is for business.

37
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,687
You got that right.

38
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,487
-Let's head inside! -Yes, sir.

39
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:35,987
He says we'll be disappointed? Yet he goes in anyway.

40
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:38,587
Two adults and one child.

41
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:40,287
I sincerely apologize

42
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,787
for embarrassing you with our fight earlier.

43
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:45,187
Who's that guy pushing his weight around?

44
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,587
He's the president from a mortgage company.

45
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:52,587
Over the past month he's been frequenting our private spa.

46
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,987
Business harassment.

47
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,387
We're going to prepare some freshly caught octopuses.

48
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,087
So please come to our restaurant after your baths.

49
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,187
Looks tasty!

50
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:09,187
All right, spa first and octopus later.

51
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,287
Looks like we're starting to run low on octopuses,

52
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,187
so I'll go to the coast and catch some.

53
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,187
I'll leave this place to you.

54
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,387
Huh? But low tide is at 8:02 pm today.

55
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,287
One hour earlier won't make a difference.

56
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,887
Amazing! Look at all the variety of baths.

57
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:32,787
I can't decide.

58
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,787
Let's check out the iron tub first!

59
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:41,087
Such a nice bath!

60
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,087
Ran, the heat's starting to get to me.

61
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,287
Huh? Already?

62
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:52,087
Hey, is it all right for you to get in the spa even when you're injured?

63
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:56,187
No, that's why I'll only take a light dip in the Jacuzzi.

64
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,687
I can't wring a towel while I'm like this after all.

65
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:05,287
Conan, this spa is fabulous.

66
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:07,287
My body's floating on the water.

67
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,687
I... I'm heading out now.

68
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:12,687
Weird child.

69
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,387
Wasn't she...

70
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,687
So good.

71
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:32,587
Drinking beer again, aren't you going to driving later?

72
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:37,587
No need to worry. I've decided that we'll stay at a nearby hotel tonight.

73
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,087
That was actually your plan all along, wasn't it?

74
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,887
No, the octopus suckers are getting on me.

75
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:46,687
The arms will move even after they're cut off.

76
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,987
Aren't they fresh?

77
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:50,587
I used a harpoon to capture these during low tide.

78
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:54,287
But at other times, I use octopus pots or long-lines to trap them.

79
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,387
How do you figure out where to place the pots and long-lines?

80
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:59,987
I float a buoy to mark the spot.

81
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:03,487
Do other people around here fish for octopuses too?

82
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:06,387
Just me, since I'm specially trained as a fisherman.

83
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:07,887
But I only did when I felt like it.

84
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,587
And my dad suddenly died a year ago,

85
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,387
so I've become this place's manager on short notice.

86
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,287
What was that sound?

87
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:20,687
It was probably from the private outdoor spa.

88
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:24,687
Hey! Go check out the private outdoor spa.

89
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:25,887
Sure!

90
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:47,987
President...

91
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,687
Dad...

92
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:51,387
No way.

93
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:55,087
It's no use, he's already stopped breathing.

94
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,287
Please call the police and an ambulance!

95
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,587
Ah, right!

96
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,287
The deceased is mortgage company president,

97
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:16,187
Hideaki Umezu is frequented this private outdoor spa every night, right?

98
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,687
That's right.

99
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,787
You found him bleeding from his head and sitting in the spa?

100
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:23,487
It was at exactly 8:00.

101
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:27,587
A loud tumbling and splashing sound came from this outdoor spa.

102
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:30,387
A rock on the cliff was close to tumbling off,

103
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,887
and I was about to schedule a maintenance appointment.

104
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,587
Safety management is a great responsibility, you know!

105
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,787
I'm truly sorry.

106
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:41,287
So this was an accident. The rock fell from that cliff

107
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,987
and hit Mr. Umezu's head.

108
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:46,587
Hey, retrieve that rock immediately!

109
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:48,187
Yes, sir!

110
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:53,287
Ah, let me help too.

111
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,387
We don't require your help.

112
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,387
Oh, I see.

113
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,287
This rock is covered in quite a bit of moss.

114
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,187
Bloodstains and hair are attached on it.

115
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,287
Looks like the rock broke off and fell from here.

116
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,887
Hey, there are friction marks

117
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,987
on the nearby rocks around that hole.

118
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:23,787
What? This is...

119
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:26,887
Don't tell me someone tried to force the rock out.

120
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,787
And caused the scratch marks by wiggling the rock around?

121
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:30,787
In other words,

122
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:34,787
the rock didn't naturally fall off the cliff and hit Mr. Umezu.

123
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:37,187
Rather, someone stood on top of the cliff

124
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:40,587
and threw the rock directly at Mr. Umezu.

125
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,187
This is not an accident, but a murder!

126
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:47,287
But, we did hear sounds resembling a rock rolling down the cliff.

127
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,387
Since the rock was heavy, the culprit rolled it over the edge.

128
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,287
I see.

129
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,087
At this height, it was impossible for anyone to enter from the outside.

130
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:03,787
In that case, the only passage to get here is from that glass door.

131
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,387
A crime committed by someone

132
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:07,187
from this hot springs park at 8:00,

133
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,387
so it seems...

134
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:12,987
All right, everyone gather in the lobby!

135
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:19,587
I'll bring some tea here.

136
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:21,087
Watch out!

137
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:26,187
Hey, you! Where were you looking?

138
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:28,787
I'm terribly sorry!

139
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,687
My apologies.

140
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:35,687
I can't believe that.

141
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:39,487
Mr. Maekawa, there's no need for tea, so please come here.

142
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:42,687
All right.

143
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,787
What do you want to talk to us about?

144
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:49,487
Mr. Umezu was apparently murdered by someone!

145
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,387
During the estimated time of death around 8:00 pm.

146
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:55,187
The relevant parties in the spas

147
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,287
of this hot springs park were you three people!

148
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:59,387
I would like to ask what you were doing

149
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,787
and your whereabouts during that time.

150
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:03,087
Nonsense!

151
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,087
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us?

152
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,887
First, I'll question the person who met with Mr. Umezu last,

153
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:11,887
Secretary Yagihashi, if you please!

154
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:14,387
Yes, at around 7:00,

155
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:17,787
I was helping the president get changed in the locker room.

156
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,287
After I sent the president off,

157
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,087
I received a call from work and I returned to the spa

158
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:26,787
about 5 minutes after Mr. Mouri and the others.

159
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:28,987
Where were you at around 8:00?

160
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:33,387
I was taking a shower. After that I heard the commotion.

161
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:39,687
Well, it's only a short distance from the showers to the crime scene.

162
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,387
No way!

163
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,287
And the eldest daughter, Mari?

164
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:47,887
I entered the spa some time after the detective's daughter did.

165
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,987
And once there, I was in the Jacuzzi the whole time.

166
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:52,987
Here, you can smell the jasmine from my hair, can you?

167
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,887
Jasmine?

168
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,287
In order to enhance the healing effects of our Jacuzzi,

169
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,587
we supplement it with herbs.

170
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,787
Ran, is that correct?

171
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,887
Yes.

172
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:08,787
I went in the spa earlier than both Mari and Yasuko.

173
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:13,287
The Jacuzzi is right next to the private outdoor spa, too.

174
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:16,487
Looks like Mari had an opportunity to commit the crime as well!

175
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,487
Stop blurting out nonsense!

176
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,287
And the younger daughter, Yasuko?

177
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:23,387
I was talking to a friend on the phone,

178
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:27,587
so I got in the spa about five minutes later than my sister did.

179
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,087
I was at the reclining spa in the far back.

180
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:33,287
But sometime before 8:00,

181
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:37,587
I saw Yasuko headed for the mist sauna.

182
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,987
Mr. Yagihashi was there too.

183
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:44,087
Oh, my. What were you two doing in the mist?

184
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:47,187
We happened to bump into each other at the sauna!

185
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:50,887
And officer, you forgot about the most suspicious party.

186
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:54,187
Our president was about to buyout this hot springs park.

187
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,487
Couldn't the manager, Maekawa have held a grudge over this?

188
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:00,187
The female staff member was confirmed

189
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,487
to be at the front desk by the security camera,

190
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,687
But Mr. Maekawa, you were not present at all times.

191
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:07,487
Well, since we were running low on octopuses,

192
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:10,687
I went out to catch some at sea around 7:00.

193
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:13,687
From 7:30 to 8:00 I was in the restaurant,

194
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,887
and Mr. Mouri can attest to that.

195
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,287
Is that true?

196
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:22,787
Yeah, Mr. Maekawa was with me in the restaurant the whole time.

197
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:25,587
I see.

198
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:29,287
To recap of the four people relating to Mr. Umezu,

199
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:32,187
all of you except Mr. Maekawa, were in the hot springs park.

200
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:34,787
And had the opportunity to murder him.

201
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,187
The older daughter, Mari, was at the Jacuzzi.

202
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:39,387
The younger daughter, Yasuko was at the reclining spa.

203
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,787
And the secretary Yagihashi was in the showers.

204
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,387
These two have motives, as well.

205
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:47,487
Father was fiercely opposed to the two of them getting married!

206
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,187
If you're trying to incriminate us,

207
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,187
you'd also be one to benefit from this!

208
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,487
How dare you!

209
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:57,387
After all, your business did poorly and you're in debt now, aren't you?

210
00:12:57,387 --> 00:13:01,087
You sunk your claws into dad's assets in order to pay it off, didn't you?

211
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:04,487
Don't just go saying whatever you please!

212
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:07,387
Regardless, is it true that you merely

213
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,487
"happened" to run into Yasuko at the sauna?

214
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,587
That is...

215
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,787
I called him there.

216
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,287
Yasuko!

217
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:18,787
I figured since dad opposed our marriage,

218
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:22,287
we had no choice but to elope.

219
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:26,687
We had planned to do just that after this park was bought out.

220
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,787
You're just spitting a bunch of rubbish out of your mouth.

221
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,487
Officer, don't be fooled by this man's words!

222
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,287
Because of his attempt to marry Yasuko,

223
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:37,687
father angrily told him to learn his place!

224
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:41,187
That's why he held a grudge. You ungrateful goon!

225
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:51,687
This is...

226
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,087
I see.

227
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,887
Mr. Mouri, did you figure out who did it?

228
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:58,087
Yeah, I got it.

229
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,487
I bet that the culprit didn't want to leave their fingerprints behind.

230
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,787
So they used a towel to wrap around the rock

231
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,687
before throwing it at Mr. Umezu.

232
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:12,387
In that case, the towel should have moss that rubbed off the rock.

233
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:15,787
You can see the smudges here, can't you?

234
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,187
Could it be that towel...

235
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,787
I don't know anything about it.

236
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:22,587
Why was something like that inside my bag?

237
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,887
Mari, it won't do you any good to say and talk your way out of this.

238
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:29,387
We'll find out for ourselves after having this towel explained.

239
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:30,587
Now, everyone,

240
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,887
I'll explain everything in detail.

241
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:35,287
Please, come to the private outdoor spa!

242
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:38,087
As expected of Mr. Mouri!

243
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:42,187
No good, at this rate...

244
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,587
Ran, what's up?

245
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,487
Well, I was just wondering

246
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:51,087
why I was able to stay on top of the water in the float spa.

247
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,187
That's easy.

248
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,387
Like the Dead Sea, it contains a high concentration of salt

249
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:58,387
which makes you float.

250
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,587
Float?

251
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,487
Don't tell me...

252
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:04,587
Wait, Conan!

253
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:13,887
Found it!

254
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:18,887
This is it.

255
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:22,487
Now I've figured out the trick that the culprit used!

256
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:39,293
Conan! You're always running off at the drop of a hat.

257
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,193
Ah, sorry.

258
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:44,993
Actually, Pops asked me to do something...

259
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:48,893
Got it!

260
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:51,993
All right, let's get things started!

261
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,493
The reason I named Mari as the culprt it was...

262
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,693
Just for laughs!

263
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:05,893
Mr. Mouri, this is no time for jokes!

264
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,993
Well, quiet down and listen!

265
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:11,693
Mari, your right hand is injured, isn't it?

266
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,493
Yeah...

267
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,293
With a wound like that,

268
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,493
it would be difficult to tightly wring a towel.

269
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:22,793
Wring tightly...

270
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:26,193
But that towel was tightly wrung!

271
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,193
That's right.

272
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:31,693
In other words, that towel did not belong to Mari.

273
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:35,393
However, the towel did come out of her bag.

274
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:40,193
The culprit put it there. In order to place the blame on Mari!

275
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:42,093
What was that?

276
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:45,293
However, it ended up exposing him.

277
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:48,793
He didn't think deep enough about Mari's wound.

278
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:50,793
So, how did the culprit do it?

279
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,993
The only one who was able to put the towel in the bag

280
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:56,193
that Mari carried all along is...

281
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,193
I'm terribly sorry.

282
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,593
Mr. Maekawa, it was you.

283
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:05,993
But Mr. Mouri, at the time of the crime,

284
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:09,293
Mr. Maekawa has an alibi of being with you.

285
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:12,493
Mr. Umezu's fingernails were ragged and dirty.

286
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:18,893
It's possible that Mr. Umezu didn't die after being hit by the rock.

287
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:23,293
But from having his head forced under the water. And being drowned.

288
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,493
The reason why Mr. Umezu's fingernails were ragged and dirty

289
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:30,193
was because he was struggling and scratching at the bottom of the spa.

290
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:31,793
Verify this with forensics!

291
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:32,993
Yes, sir!

292
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:38,193
However, we rushed here soon after we heard the noise made by the rock.

293
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:41,793
It's impossible to drawn a person in such a short time.

294
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:44,193
Then, when was Mr. Umezu drowned?

295
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:47,493
Look at the disposable shampoo and soap.

296
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,393
None of them were used.

297
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,393
The seats weren't used either.

298
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:55,093
You're right! They weren't used at all.

299
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:59,793
In other words, Mr. Umezu was killed as soon as he entered the spa!

300
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,993
What? Around 7:00?

301
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,793
Meanwhile, Mr. Yagihashi,

302
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:08,493
Yasuko and Mari were in the locker room.

303
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:10,293
The only person capable of committing the crime

304
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:13,093
was Mr. Maekawa.

305
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,293
At that time you went to catch octopuses.

306
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:18,593
Despite the fact that it was an hour too early for low tide.

307
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:23,493
You actually didn't go to catch octopuses, didn't you?

308
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:26,793
And without his suspecting anything,

309
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:30,493
you brained Mr. Umezu with the rock.

310
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:34,293
Then, you forced his head under the water... Drowned him.

311
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:37,093
What are you talking about?

312
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:41,693
You heard the noise at 8:00 as well, didn't you?

313
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,993
Let's see, if the time of the crime was 7:00,

314
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:48,093
then who rolled the rock at 8:00?

315
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,593
After all, Mr. Maekawa was in the restaurant at that time.

316
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:53,693
He used a trick.

317
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:56,593
Conan, do what I just taught you!

318
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,793
Right.

319
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:03,493
Inspector Yokomizo, carry that rock and climb up this cliff!

320
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,593
Sure.

321
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,193
This rock sure is heavy.

322
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:13,793
You can see a small harbor down there, right?

323
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:16,293
-Oh, yes. -Ran!

324
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,893
Here!

325
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:25,593
This rope was tied to the buoy near the harbor.

326
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:28,293
It's a type of rope called a long-line.

327
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,293
Long-line?

328
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:34,293
Grab the long-line and pull it straight.

329
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,293
Next, tilt the rock just brought up

330
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,193
forward at the edge of the cliff.

331
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:41,293
Then use the wooden rod to support the rock.

332
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:43,393
With this, we're all set.

333
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,693
Ran!

334
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:51,593
All right!

335
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:00,193
What's this?

336
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:06,793
The sea entered low tide at 8:00 and had the lowest water level.

337
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:11,093
As such, the buoy floating in the sea went down as well.

338
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,593
The buoy pulled the line down,

339
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:16,293
which removed the rod and caused the rock to fall.

340
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:20,093
In other words, he used low tide as his time difference trick.

341
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,293
Low tide?

342
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:23,993
The rope and rod that would've served as evidence

343
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:27,193
flew off the ledge and headed straight into the sea.

344
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,893
It's true.

345
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,893
See the part of the ledge that has been clipped away?

346
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,493
Oh, yes.

347
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:38,193
Those friction marks were made by the hooks attached to the long-line.

348
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,193
That was pretty telltale.

349
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:43,593
I see, using this method...

350
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,793
He could cause the rock to roll down at 8:00

351
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:48,293
even if he were in a different place.

352
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:50,093
It's an interesting deduction,

353
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:53,193
but that's all circumstantial evidence, isn't it?

354
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:55,193
Do you have any concrete evidence?

355
00:20:55,193 --> 00:21:00,893
Mr. Maekawa, why have you kept your pants rolled up all the time?

356
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,293
Why don't you roll them down?

357
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:04,593
What was that?

358
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,293
You can't, right?

359
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,793
When you brained Mr. Umezu with the rock,

360
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:11,793
his blood splattered on your pants.

361
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:15,793
You only noticed it after you saw forensics roll up his pants

362
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:18,093
to retrieve the rock from the spa.

363
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:21,793
You then unconsciously glanced at your pants.

364
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:24,793
And hurriedly rolled them up!

365
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:28,893
The police had already started their investigation,

366
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:32,793
so you couldn't change them without raising suspicion.

367
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,293
We now have decisive evidence.

368
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,893
As I thought, you held a grudge against our president

369
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:43,593
because he tried to buyout your hot springs park!

370
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,593
It wasn't just that.

371
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:49,993
A year ago, my father was driven to despair by his debts to Umezu

372
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:53,493
deliberately got drunk and ended up drowning in the spa.

373
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:56,493
I followed my father's will and used his life insurance

374
00:21:56,493 --> 00:22:00,493
to reconstruct this hot spring park and tried to regain prosperity.

375
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:04,093
But after all, I'm a man of the sea.

376
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:07,993
In the end, I couldn't do anything about Umezu's buyout,

377
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,193
so I figured if he were going to rob me of the place,

378
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:15,993
I'd think up a plan to just bury him

379
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:18,693
with the entire hot spring park.

380
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:53,493
His snoring is so load I can't sleep.

381
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:04,293
Now I can't sleep at all!

382
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,993
"Next Episode" -Here!

383
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:11,893
Officer Shiratori, thank you for your work.

384
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:18,393
She is my destiny, the one who changed my life.

385
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:21,593
Another premonition of love?

386
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,393
A stalker?

387
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:27,793
Oh, yes, I've been feeling such a presence since the other day.

388
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:32,593
Next Conan,

389
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:36,434
"Officer Shiratori Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 1)"

390
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,704
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:55,804
"Monster Movie"

392
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,904
Out next episode is about the inspector's love story.

393
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:59,604
What? Inspector Megame's love story?

394
00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:00,804
No, not him.
