1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,970
The news of Ryusuke Higo and Idol Yoko Okino

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,070
being passionately in love with each other is publicized.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,370
Ai and Kogoro who cannot believe this,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,370
go after the two.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,670
They discover the two at a restaurant in Haidocho.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,470
It seems that the two came to visit their friend

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,270
as well as their senior in High School, Mr. Teiya Asuka.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,970
That was Yoko's scream!

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,570
Yoko!

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,070
Hey, Mr. Asuka?

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,870
Get a hold of yourself! Hey!

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,370
Mr. Asuka?

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,370
Mr. Asuka!

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,870
When you searched the storeroom,

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,170
you didn't see the owner there?

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,170
No.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,470
But the next time, I was told to search the back room

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,370
so I went back about 10 minutes later.

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,570
Then, I found the owner there.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,470
-You found the owner? -Yes.

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,170
He was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket over his head.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,870
His shoes were placed near the sofa too, so I'm sure!

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,870
And, what's after that?

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,670
After she told me this,

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,770
I went to wake him up about 10 minutes later.

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,170
Back then, he wasn't asleep on the sofa.

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,770
Just about that time, I got an e-mail from the owner

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,270
telling me if I could bring Mr, Higo and Yoko to the storeroom

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,270
without being noticed by anyone.

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,270
About what time was it?

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,870
About 7:30 p.m.

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,870
That's why I brought those two to the storeroom, you see.

33
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,170
I called him just before going into the storeroom,

34
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,770
but there was no answer.

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,270
Since he didn't come out,

36
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,770
I thought he went back to the back room.

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,070
I left the two at the storeroom and went to the back room,

38
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,070
but only Mr. Yamada was there.

39
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,770
When all three of us were wondering where the owner went...

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,270
We heard Yoko scream.

41
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,270
Although there are 5 suspects,

42
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,070
the suspicious ones are those three.

43
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,870
How on earth did the perp commit the crime?

44
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,370
A canvas stained black with crime.

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,070
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

46
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,070
The truth of the case and couple is ambiguous.

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,170
What happened in the back room?

48
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

49
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,170
His name is Detective Conan!

51
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:16,828
"The Suspects are Passionate Lovers (Part 2)"

52
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,528
And?

53
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:23,628
Just what do you intend to do to Yoko?

54
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:25,728
What... what am I intending to do?

55
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:29,528
That's not my question.

56
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:33,028
When you two entered the storeroom where you found the corpse,

57
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,528
was the door really locked?

58
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,828
Yes, I'm sure the waiter unlocked it.

59
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:41,828
Then, after calling Mr. Asuka several times,

60
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,228
he told us to wait there and left.

61
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,728
He didn't come back for a while.

62
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:49,228
In the storeroom, we saw a lot of things from abroad,

63
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:52,228
like canned goods and such that we never saw before,

64
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:54,528
so we were looking around.

65
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,028
Then we noticed

66
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:59,928
something that looked like blood on the floor beyond.

67
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,128
So we went to check on it.

68
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:07,928
Then we found Mr. Asuka dead.

69
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,028
I see.

70
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,228
By the way, Mr. Higo,

71
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,528
you mentioned that you lost your cell phone,

72
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:18,428
but do you have any idea where you could've lost it?

73
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:23,528
No. I seem to forget it on the table of restaurants that I go to.

74
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,728
Come to think of it,

75
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:28,728
the waitress spilled wine and changed the tablecloth.

76
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,328
It could be in the restroom, too.

77
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:34,128
Because I usually keep it in my pocket together with my handkerchief.

78
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,728
When I take out my handkerchief,

79
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:38,928
I forget to put my cell phone back.

80
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:40,628
Haven't you experienced similar cases?

81
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:41,928
Yes, I guess.

82
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,828
Yes! I do, I do!

83
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:45,728
I often forget my cell phone, too.

84
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,428
You never forget it.

85
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:51,828
So, while you were in the restaurant,

86
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,528
you couldn't make contact with the owner?

87
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,528
No.

88
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:57,728
But you could've borrowed Yoko's cell phone.

89
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:01,528
The thing is... I brought my cell phone,

90
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,028
but I forgot to charge it last night before going to bed.

91
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:08,128
When it came time to call him, the battery was dead.

92
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,728
Things like this happen, right?

93
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,828
-Never! -What?

94
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:14,628
They do happen.

95
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,128
They do happen, Yoko.

96
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,728
Okay.

97
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:25,228
And what favor did you come to ask the victim today?

98
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:26,728
-Well... -That's...

99
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:28,628
What?

100
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,928
This blanket is the one that Mr. Asuka was using

101
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,128
when he was asleep, right?

102
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,828
It should be.

103
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,328
Is something the matter, Conan?

104
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:38,528
Right over here.

105
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:43,228
There's a tiny hole and a reddish black stain is around it.

106
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,228
What?

107
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:48,028
Hey! Don't tell me that it's blood?

108
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:51,228
Nope, because it smells like wine.

109
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:52,728
Seriously.

110
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,728
Stop surprising me like that.

111
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,528
But, how did it get here?

112
00:06:57,528 --> 00:07:00,128
The smell is clear,

113
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,828
so not much time has passed since it got here.

114
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,028
At most, it was probably just a few hours ago at the most.

115
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:06,928
Which means, he could've gotten involved in an incident.

116
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,528
Even after I cleaned the place thoroughly,

117
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,428
I could hear the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

118
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:15,828
He was sleeping on the sofa with a blanket over his head.

119
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,628
But when we came here the first time,

120
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,928
the only thing here was the blanket

121
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,628
and there was no one here.

122
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:22,728
-Hey! -I see.

123
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:24,628
-Are you listening to me? -Which means that maybe...

124
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,428
In here.

125
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,828
Found it. There's a hole.

126
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:34,328
Moreover, there is a slight bit of wine stain on this, too.

127
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,728
-Hey, Conan, don't! -It's just as I thought.

128
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:42,528
He established an alibi in an instant

129
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:48,028
by cleverly using those convenient items.

130
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,828
So, summarizing what you all said,

131
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,528
since the owner of this restaurant,

132
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:59,228
Mr. Teiya Asuka was late coming back,

133
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,028
sommelier Mr. Yamada,

134
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:06,628
waiter Mr. Konoe and waitress Ms. Banba decided to look for him.

135
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:10,028
Mr. Yamada and Mr. Konoe came to search

136
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,028
this back room where the staff takes breaks,

137
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:15,528
but the owner was nowhere in sight.

138
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,728
Although Ms. Banba went to look for him in the basement storeroom,

139
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,728
he wasn't there either.

140
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:20,928
That's right.

141
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,828
Then, ten minutes later,

142
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:26,428
the three of you decided to search for the owner again.

143
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,728
This time, Mr. Yamada searched the storeroom,

144
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:30,528
Mr. Konoe searched the restroom,

145
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,828
and Ms. Banba searched the back room.

146
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,328
And it was then that you found the owner asleep on the sofa

147
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:40,628
with the blanket over his head, correct, Ms. Banba?

148
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:44,128
Yes. I couldn't see his head since it was covered with the blanket,

149
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,828
but his shoes were by the sofa, too.

150
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,528
And then 10 minutes after that,

151
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:54,128
Mr. Yamada came to the back room again

152
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:57,928
but the owner was no longer under the blanket and missing.

153
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,128
Just about the same time,

154
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:02,528
Mr. Konoe receives an e-mail on his cell phone from the owner

155
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:05,828
telling him to bring Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom

156
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,428
without anyone noticing.

157
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:12,028
So, Mr. Konoe escorts the two to the storeroom

158
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:14,428
and calls out to the owner but gets no answer.

159
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,928
Therefore, he leaves the two at the storeroom

160
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,928
and goes off to search for the owner.

161
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:21,628
After that, you two who were waiting at the storeroom,

162
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,928
discovers the owner's dead body.

163
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,528
Is that correct?

164
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:27,128
-Yes. -Yes.

165
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:31,828
The back room and the storeroom are always locked.

166
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,428
The keys are hanging at the entrance of the corridor,

167
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,528
in clear view of the staff,

168
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,928
and are to be left on the premises.

169
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,628
And the only one who has the spare keys is the owner.

170
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:46,228
Moreover, when Mr. Konoe took Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom,

171
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:49,928
if the door of the storeroom was properly locked...

172
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,328
The only ones left, capable of committing the crime

173
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:56,628
are the two who were waiting in the storeroom, Mr. Higo and Yoko.

174
00:09:56,628 --> 00:10:00,528
-What? -Wait... wait, Inspector!

175
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:02,828
I don't know about that soccer guy.

176
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:06,928
But such a lovely girl like Yoko would never commit murder!

177
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:08,728
But considering the circumstances...

178
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:14,028
So, the owner who was actually a big fan of Yoko,

179
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,828
hid in the storeroom waiting for her to be alone,

180
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,428
so he could attack her.

181
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,728
But the soccer guy was still there.

182
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,728
They got into a fight and he killed him!

183
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:27,428
Yoko's only protecting the soccer guy because she's kind!

184
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,828
That means she's helping a criminal avoid arrest.

185
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:33,828
Please overlook that part for her, will you?

186
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:38,328
Mr. Mouri?

187
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:40,628
Please pour more wine for me.

188
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:45,628
Don't tell me you really believed that I'd say something like that?

189
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:48,828
It's harder for me to believe that attitude of yours.

190
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,828
Don't you think it's strange?

191
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:54,228
What is?

192
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:58,028
The number of people who initially searched this back room.

193
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,328
-What? -In a room like this,

194
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,628
you can tell at first glance whether someone here or not.

195
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:08,028
Yet, Mr. Yamada and Mr. Konoe both searched this room.

196
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:11,628
The storeroom on the other hand has lots of shelves and blind spots,

197
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:14,628
so more people could've been sent over to search it,

198
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:18,228
but Ms. Banba went there alone.

199
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:20,528
It sure is strange.

200
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,128
Why did they do something like that...

201
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:28,928
It was because they wanted a third party to confirm

202
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:31,828
that the owner was not in this room.

203
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:34,228
In order to complete the murder trick!

204
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,895
Why did they do something like that...

205
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:56,395
It was because they wanted a third party to confirm

206
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:59,195
that the owner was not in this room.

207
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:02,495
In order to complete the murder trick!

208
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:04,095
Which means...

209
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:06,295
Mr. Yamada, Mr. Konoe,

210
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:08,795
one of you is the killer.

211
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:13,395
Mr. Yamada's the one who said we should search the room together.

212
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:15,695
Right?

213
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:19,095
Yes, I did say so, indeed.

214
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:23,595
Because there are lockers and cabinets in this room!

215
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:27,695
Did you think that the owner would be hiding in places like that?

216
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:30,395
You never know, right?

217
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:35,195
Besides, why should I have to make him confirm that the owner isn't here?

218
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:38,995
Back then, we were here only for a matter of minutes, you know?

219
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,695
No, it wasn't for a matter of minutes.

220
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,895
Just an instant.

221
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:48,195
Back then, you set it up in an instant.

222
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:51,595
The image of the ownerleeping sleeping on the couch

223
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,495
with a blanket over his head!

224
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,495
Don't be ridiculous!

225
00:12:55,495 --> 00:13:00,295
Are you saying that I stuck something inside the blanket back then?

226
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,495
I didn't do anything of that sort, did I?

227
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:05,295
No. Besides, there was nothing near the sofa

228
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,195
to do something like that in the first place.

229
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,595
I bought what you asked for, Mr. Mouri!

230
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:12,295
A blanket, an ice pick, a vacuum bag,

231
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:15,295
and five sets of heavy clothing!

232
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,195
But what are you going to do with these items?

233
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,195
Okay, let's start the experiment!

234
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:23,695
Hey, Conan! Do exactly as I told you to.

235
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,495
Yep, I got it!

236
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:33,395
First, you put the clothes into the vacuum bag.

237
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,195
Then use a vacuum cleaner to remove the air from inside the bag

238
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,795
and flatten it.

239
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,295
I see. So that's what the owner was doing

240
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:43,095
when I heard him using the vacuum cleaner.

241
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:47,495
Put the vacuum bag with the clothes inside on the sofa.

242
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:50,795
Then put the blanket over it, and it's ready!

243
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:55,995
See? This way it just looks like there's a blanket on the sofa, right?

244
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:57,095
Yeah.

245
00:13:57,095 --> 00:14:01,095
But, if you stab it with the ice pick,

246
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:02,995
so it reaches the very bottom, like this.

247
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:08,895
Air begins entering the bag from the hole and...

248
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,595
See! Now it looks like someone is sleeping under it, right?

249
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,295
Right!

250
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:17,295
Then, you just have to pull the owner's shoes

251
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:22,295
that were hidden under the sofa out like this, and all done!

252
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,495
He would've had enough time to do all this just before leaving the room

253
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:28,295
without Mr. Konoe noticing, right?

254
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:32,995
But Mr. Konoe could've pulled the trick off as well.

255
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:34,795
-What? -No.

256
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,695
You're the one who did it, Mr. Yamada.

257
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,095
Why? Because...

258
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:43,395
The blanket in this room had a small hole

259
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:47,295
with a wine stain around it.

260
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,395
In other words, it's proof that you used it

261
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,095
when opening a hole in the vacuum bag.

262
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,095
An essential tool for a sommelier,

263
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,095
the sommelier's knife!

264
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,695
You poked the blanket

265
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:02,295
with the tip of the corkscrew of your sommelier's knife

266
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:05,395
that you use to open wine bottles.

267
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:08,195
That's why there were wine stains

268
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:11,795
around the hole of the blanket and clothes.

269
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:13,895
Wait a minute, Mr. Mouri.

270
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:16,895
According to a sommelier friend of mine,

271
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:21,795
he said that he doesn't pierce the cork all the way.

272
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,995
Because otherwise, pieces of cork will fall into the wine.

273
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:29,995
In the case of the old corks of super expensive aged wine,

274
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,395
he told me that there are times he pierces the cork right through.

275
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:35,195
But I wonder if there's such wine in this restaurant.

276
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:36,395
No, there aren't!

277
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,995
We're not a three-star restaurant, you know!

278
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:42,295
That's why I'm saying somebody did this to frame me.

279
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,395
That's true.

280
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,395
Normally, there is no blood stain

281
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,895
on the corkscrew of the sommelier's knife.

282
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:53,795
That is, if you, Mr. Yamada is a real sommelier!

283
00:15:56,095 --> 00:16:00,695
After you uncorked the wine at Mr. Higo and Yoko's table,

284
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:05,095
you put that cork on the table without sniffing it, correct?

285
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,895
A sommelier would never do that.

286
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:10,595
Known as bouchonne,

287
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,195
about one in every ten or twenty wines,

288
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,195
because of the remains of cleansing fluid

289
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:15,995
used in the process of making cork,

290
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:20,695
the wine is degraded and smells of cork.

291
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:23,895
Why did you fail to confirm this?

292
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,995
Besides, you smoke cigarettes.

293
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,495
A sommelier who values the sense of taste,

294
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,195
would never smoke.

295
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:35,595
The load of cigarette butts that were found in the men's room

296
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,695
was of the same brand,

297
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:41,395
but some were long and the filters were chewed on,

298
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:45,995
while others were smoked down to the end and then snuffed out.

299
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:49,495
In other words, the cigarette butts were of two different men.

300
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,995
Judging from the amount of cigarettes,

301
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:54,295
they were not of the customers but of the staff of this restaurant.

302
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:57,395
Mr. Konoe probably smoked half of them,

303
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,195
while Mr. Yamada smoked the other half.

304
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:04,895
Examination of the saliva on the filters will easily reveal

305
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:07,495
that you're a fake sommelier!

306
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,095
The cell phone that Mr. Higo forgot in the men's room

307
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,695
was what triggered you to commit the crime.

308
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:16,995
Correct?

309
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,795
Reading the mail on his cell,

310
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:22,995
you found out that Mr. Higo and Yoko

311
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,795
were coming here today to meet the owner.

312
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,195
Therefore, you thought about committing this crime,

313
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,195
took out about 5 sets of clothes that were vacuum packed

314
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:32,195
in the owner's locker in the back room,

315
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:36,695
put them on the sofa and put a blanket over them.

316
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:40,195
You probably sent the owner a mail

317
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:42,995
asking him to buy some additional items to delay his return

318
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,195
so the other staff members

319
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:47,095
would suggest looking for him because he was late.

320
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:50,495
And of course, it turned out as you planned.

321
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:53,695
First, you decided to search the back room together with Mr. Konoe,

322
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:56,595
and after making him see that the owner wasn't there.

323
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,195
On your way out,

324
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:01,995
you opened a hole in the vacuum bag, inflated the blanket

325
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:05,195
and took the owner's shoes out from under the sofa.

326
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:08,195
Then you sent mail out from Mr. Higo's phone

327
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:09,695
saying that you wanted to meet him in private

328
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:13,695
so to wait for him in the storeroom.

329
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,795
You then pretended to search for the owner once again

330
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,495
and went to the storeroom where you killed him.

331
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,695
You tricked Ms. Banba and Mr. Konoe

332
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:21,795
into thinking that the owner was in the back room,

333
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:24,195
asleep on the sofa with a blanket over his head,

334
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:28,695
and went back there 10 minutes later to wake the owner.

335
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,995
And while doing so,

336
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:33,195
you sent mail to Mr. Konoe from the phone of the owner

337
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,495
that you took when you killed him,

338
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:37,095
telling him to take Mr. Higo and Yoko to the storeroom.

339
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,595
You went back to the back room,

340
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:41,495
took the clothes out of the vacuum bag that was left on the sofa,

341
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,095
put them back into the owner's locker

342
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,795
and hid all proof of the crime.

343
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:49,495
Isn't that right?

344
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,495
Proof.

345
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:55,695
Where on earth are the vacuum bag and cell phones then?

346
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:57,795
Inside the trash box in the kitchen!

347
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,095
I just found them

348
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:04,595
and the forensics are checking them out now!

349
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,295
You probably went into the kitchen

350
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:11,295
during the commotion when the owner's body was found

351
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:13,295
and dumped the vacuum bag and cell phones you had in your pocket

352
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,595
into the trash box.

353
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:18,895
You didn't have time to wear gloves,

354
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:21,995
so I'm sure your fingerprints are all over them.

355
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,595
So, give yourself up!

356
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,895
You killed him, didn't you?

357
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,695
I... I had no choice

358
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:38,295
because the owner found out.

359
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:41,995
That I was sticking fake labels on cheap wine,

360
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:44,595
selling them as expensive wine.

361
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:45,995
The profits went into the business,

362
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:49,195
and I even gave kickbacks to the wine dealers.

363
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,895
I told him straight

364
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:54,595
that customers who come to a former J-Leaguer's restaurant are not experts,

365
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,995
and know nothing about the taste of wine,

366
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:01,195
so let's make money this way and enlarge the shop!

367
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:04,695
But the owner wouldn't listen.

368
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:09,295
Moreover, he declared that he'd turn me in for fraud.

369
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,795
That's only natural.

370
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:14,495
Mr. Asuka, used to be a famed player,

371
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:20,495
who always played fair and square and never once received a red card.

372
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:01,795
And? What favor did you want to ask the victim?

373
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:06,395
One of our teachers from the high school

374
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:11,195
that Mr. Asuka, Yoko and I used to attend is retiring.

375
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:14,495
So, we went to choose a wristwatch

376
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,695
to give him as a gift for his retirement

377
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:18,795
and was hoping that Mr. Asuka would also

378
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,795
write a celebratory message to him.

379
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:23,995
After all, Mr. Asuka's the first celebrity

380
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:26,195
out of Konan High School, you see.

381
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:29,095
Why didn't you say so in the beginning then?

382
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:30,495
We tried to say so.

383
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,995
But we were interrupted each time.

384
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,295
It's me.

385
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:37,695
Which means you two aren't going with each other?

386
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:41,195
No. Because my love is soccer and it will be for some time yet.

387
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,695
Mine are singing and acting!

388
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,095
I see. I wish you both luck in whatever you do!

389
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,295
-Thank you! -Thank you!

390
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:52,295
At any rate, I'm sorry for all the worry we caused you.

391
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:53,595
And Mr. Mouri,

392
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:57,195
thank you for pointing out the perp who did what he did to Mr. Asuka.

393
00:22:57,195 --> 00:23:01,795
And Conan, thank you for helping out with the deduction!

394
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:05,695
And you.

395
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:08,595
Thank you for finding the evidence for us!

396
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,695
Nice assist!

397
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:16,495
I wish you could play on our team in place of Takahiro.

398
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,195
Thank you, Ai!

399
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,895
Hey, what're you doing?

400
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:35,295
Let's hurry to the park and play soccer!

401
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:36,995
-What? -No joke?

402
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,295
It looks like it's going to rain, though.

403
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:40,695
No matter how hard you try,

404
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:43,695
girls are never going to make it into Mr. Higo's team.

405
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,395
That's Yoko's song!

406
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:55,995
"Next Episode"

407
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:57,995
So many toys!

408
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,295
Are just you two living here?

409
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:04,595
Yeah! We love toys and get along really well!

410
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:05,695
Right?

411
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,295
Toys are fantastic!

412
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:11,495
Somebody help!

413
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,095
Shoots.

414
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:17,695
My shoe and tranquilizer gun are going through maintenance now!

415
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:24,195
Next Conan, "The Detective Squad Takes Shelter from the Rain"

416
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:27,038
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,238
"Toy building"

418
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:32,838
Thanks to Mr. Higo, the surroundings have a glow.

419
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,438
I'm happy for you.
