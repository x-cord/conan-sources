1
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,732
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,732
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,432
A strange murder takes place at a pottery making class.

4
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:26,432
The words on a tea cup also poses a mystery.

5
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:28,032
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:29,832
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,932
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:57,191
Ran decides to go to the pottery making class Sonoko is going to.

9
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:00,991
You're pretty good for a beginner.

10
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,691
Mr. Mino.

11
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,791
Attention, everyone!

12
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,891
Does anyone know this child?

13
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,491
Conan?

14
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:11,491
And I go to check up on her.

15
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:18,191
The instructor of the pottery making class is Muneyuki Mino

16
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,891
and his assistant is Kikuyo Kasama.

17
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:26,291
Later, Mr. Mino's adopted son-in-law,

18
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,191
Motoo Mino comes back from work.

19
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,391
But he suddenly disappears.

20
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,091
This storage room's the only place we haven't looked.

21
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,091
The cabinet...

22
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,891
A piece of cloth...

23
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:43,791
is sticking out from under the cabinet door.

24
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,491
Isn't it one of the aprons you use in class?

25
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,191
-Motoo... -Snap out of it!

26
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,591
Wake up, Motoo!

27
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:04,291
Motoo...

28
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,891
I know who the killer is, but...

29
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,491
I'm finished!

30
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,491
It's my tea cup! Pretty good, huh?

31
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:18,191
Yes, that's really quite good.

32
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,591
But you know, sonny,

33
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,991
it appears as if you're worried about something.

34
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:24,891
You're either hiding some deep, dark secret

35
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:28,591
or debating about something important.

36
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,191
I'm right, aren't I?

37
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:33,991
The soul never lies.

38
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:36,191
You're very good, sir.

39
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,491
I think you should take care of your own affairs

40
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,591
before meddling in other people's.

41
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,991
But this is the cup you made, sir.

42
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,091
What?

43
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:53,891
While you were busy looking through the desk,

44
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,491
I put yours over here.

45
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:59,691
I thought for sure you'd catch on.

46
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,991
And if this is your tea cup,

47
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,991
then you must be hiding something.

48
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:12,491
Mr. Mino, what are you hiding?

49
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,791
Tell me.

50
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:25,191
"Murder At The Pottery Making Class (Part 2)"

51
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:36,291
This kid...

52
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,291
Excuse me.

53
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,791
Did you find a pen?

54
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,291
Yes, here.

55
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,791
Use this.

56
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,991
Thank you, and may I also use this desk?

57
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,391
By all means.

58
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,391
I appreciate this.

59
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,391
Now, please go back to the storage room

60
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,891
where the inspector is waiting.

61
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,291
All right.

62
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,991
No doubt about it.

63
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:04,891
Mr. Mino is the murderer.

64
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,991
I've pretty much figured out his alibi trick

65
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,491
but while I was checking the body, he hid the evidence.

66
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,891
I saw him pick up those scissors,

67
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,991
that means the evidence is still somewhere.

68
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:21,991
It's got to be someplace.

69
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:24,091
But if I can't find it...

70
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,891
Gosh. Isn't there something else?

71
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:31,491
Something that the killer's missed.

72
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:32,891
Think...

73
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,991
Sorry, kid.

74
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,391
A necktie.

75
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,691
Yes, this is it!

76
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,691
I've found it!

77
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,291
I've finally found it.

78
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,491
You overlooked a piece of evidence,

79
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,191
only a professional potter would leave behind.

80
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,291
Inspector Megure!

81
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,791
I've confirmed the details.

82
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,891
Give it to me.

83
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,091
And that's not the only thing I learned.

84
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:08,091
I see, debts.

85
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:11,191
Kasama Kikuyo.

86
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:15,291
It seems you have debts totalling 10,000,000 yen.

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,291
Yes, I do. I found a nice condominium.

88
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,891
What about it?

89
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,491
Nothing. I just thought it was interesting.

90
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,891
The late Mr. Motoo just took out an insurance policy last week

91
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:30,091
and the premium was for exactly 10,000,000 yen, payable to you.

92
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:33,391
The timing just seemed so perfect.

93
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:34,691
On top of that,

94
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:38,291
just before Mr. Motoo's body was discovered in the cabinet,

95
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,991
you had come to get the first aid kit from that very cabinet.

96
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,391
If you weren't the murderer,

97
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:47,391
you surely would have seen his body in there.

98
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,691
I already told you!

99
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:52,191
I opened the cabinet but nobody was inside!

100
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,091
Besides, it didn't take me more than a minute

101
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,991
to go get the first aid kit and return.

102
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:58,491
There's no way I could kill someone

103
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,391
and hide the body in the cabinet!

104
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:04,191
According to everyone's testimony, when Mr. Mino got hurt,

105
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,891
you volunteered to get the first aid kit.

106
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:12,491
What if you had already put Motoo's body in the cabinet?

107
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,391
You didn't want his body to be discovered yet

108
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:18,491
so you went to get the first aid kit yourself.

109
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:19,991
But when you opened the cabinet,

110
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:24,391
his apron slid out and got caught in the door.

111
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:26,291
Maybe that's what happened.

112
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:30,391
That's absurd! I'm not a murderer!

113
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,591
Don't lie, Kikuyo.

114
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,991
I saw you.

115
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:39,391
I came in here looking for you.

116
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:42,991
I saw you choking Motoo's neck.

117
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:46,091
Is that true?

118
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:51,091
It is. She said she was helping Motoo change

119
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,191
but that's not what it looked like.

120
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,191
I was just playing...

121
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,191
You can tell us about it down at the station.

122
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,591
Hold on a minute, officer!

123
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,091
What's wrong, Inspector?

124
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,791
You know, every time we start to walk out with the suspect,

125
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,191
a strange voice stops us.

126
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,291
It goes, "Funyaa" or "Oops", like that.

127
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,691
Oh, you're talking about Kogoro Mouri.

128
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:22,691
Well, you can rest assured. He's not here today.

129
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:24,791
Oh, that's right.

130
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,791
Funyaa...

131
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,091
Sonoko, what's the matter?

132
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,391
I just remembered! This girl does it, too.

133
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:42,791
Inspector Megure, you've done it again. I'm so bored.

134
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,391
How dare you!

135
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,191
Didn't you notice it?

136
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,491
The victim Motoo's sleeves were rolled up

137
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:51,291
but the lengths weren't the same.

138
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,391
Doesn't that seem like

139
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:57,191
he was attacked while he was working in the class?

140
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,191
And if that's the case,

141
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:01,391
then the killer could only be that person, don't you think?

142
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,891
Who are you talking about?

143
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,191
You don't mean...

144
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:07,491
Yes. That person who came into this storage room

145
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:11,091
while Kikuyo was helping Motoo change

146
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:14,391
then forced her to return to the class,

147
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:18,591
leaving him alone with the victim... that person is...

148
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,091
Muneyuki Mino!

149
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,091
Yes, you are the murderer!

150
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,791
Sonoko.

151
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,491
We noticed the thing about his sleeves

152
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,591
but Mr. Mino has an alibi.

153
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:33,391
According to Ran's testimony,

154
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,391
when Mr. Mino left the storage room earlier today,

155
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:39,691
the apron wasn't sticking out like it was

156
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,491
when they discovered the body.

157
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:45,691
And he was with all of you the entire time later that day, wasn't he?

158
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,391
Besides, just before the body was discovered,

159
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:50,191
Kikuyo had come and opened the cabinet.

160
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,091
We're not sure she's actually the killer yet

161
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,991
but she should have screamed if he was inside,

162
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,291
wouldn't that be the natural thing to do?

163
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,991
That is, if she didn't kill him.

164
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,591
And unless Mr. Mino was a magician,

165
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,091
there isn't any way he could have put the body in the cabinet

166
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:06,991
without using his hands. Isn't that right?

167
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,791
No. Actually, he did use magic.

168
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:14,691
Mr. Mino used Ran and Kikuyo as assistants

169
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,491
and made Motoo's body appear in the cabinet

170
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,791
after making it seem like he wasn't inside.

171
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,091
Kikuyo and I were assistants?

172
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,791
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.

173
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,991
You'll know what I mean when we reenact it.

174
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,291
Let's see.

175
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:33,091
Officer Takagi. Will you be my assistant?

176
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,191
What? Who, me?

177
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,199
Take a good look, people. What you see before

178
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,699
is a simple cabinet with nothing rigged.

179
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,599
Please check and make sure nothing is sticking out of the cabinet.

180
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,699
Everything's clear.

181
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,299
All right then, please open the door on the right side.

182
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,199
It's opened.

183
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:08,299
You've checked and made sure nothing is inside?

184
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,499
Yes.

185
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,399
I didn't notice anything unusual.

186
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,799
A piece of cloth is sticking out from under the cabinet?

187
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,199
That's strange.

188
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,999
That cloth wasn't here before.

189
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,999
So that's how it was done! It's on the inside of the door!

190
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,199
That's right.

191
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,699
I asked Conan and the man from the crime lab

192
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,999
to stick that handkerchief there.

193
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:39,699
I'm almost certain Mr. Mino taped the end of the apron

194
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,999
to the inside of the accordion style door's right side

195
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,699
then closed the door while pushing the end of the apron inside.

196
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,599
Then, when someone opens the door,

197
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:53,599
the apron will be pulled out.

198
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:57,599
And when the door is closed again, the apron would stick out.

199
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,999
What I'm saying is, Mr. Mino...

200
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,699
deliberately cracked the plate in front of the cabinet

201
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,299
so that Ran would see that

202
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,499
there was nothing sticking out from underneath

203
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,299
when she was cleaning up.

204
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,199
Then he made Kikuyo go get the first aid kit

205
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,699
telling her he had hurt his hand.

206
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,199
When she opened the door to the cabinet,

207
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,499
the apron came loose and got caught under the door.

208
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,899
I see.

209
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,099
That way it would look like there was nobody in the cabinet

210
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,999
when Ran was cleaning up the broken plate

211
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:32,299
and as if someone had put it in there later.

212
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,099
But...

213
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:39,099
what if Kikuyo had noticed the apron when closing the door

214
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,699
after getting the first aid kit?

215
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,199
I don't think she would look down when closing the door,

216
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,099
not knowing that there was an injured person waiting for her.

217
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,999
So where was the body all that time?

218
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,499
When the door was opened, the body fell out

219
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:57,999
that means the body was probably leaning against the door.

220
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:02,999
Kikuyo had to have seen it when she got the first aid kit.

221
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,099
I think we'll know the answer

222
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:06,599
when we open the door one more time.

223
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,999
Huh?

224
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,499
But this time, open both doors at the same time.

225
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,899
Both sides at the same time?

226
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,999
A mop?

227
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,099
This wasn't in there the last time I opened it up.

228
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,199
How'd you do that?

229
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,699
It's a simple trick.

230
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:32,299
I tied some string to the top of the mop,

231
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:36,699
then made a knot at the end of the string.

232
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,599
Next, I passed the string

233
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,499
through the hanger bar on the right side shelf

234
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:44,499
and hung the mop so it leaned forward.

235
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,999
Then I passed the string

236
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,699
through the opening above the door on the left side,

237
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,299
pulled it so that the knot would get caught

238
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,399
when the door closed and that kept it in place.

239
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,199
That way, even when the door on the right is opened,

240
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,199
the mop is hidden by the joint.

241
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,799
When both doors are opened at the same time,

242
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,499
the knot which is the stopper comes loose

243
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,299
and the mop falls out!

244
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,399
The mop is Motoo,

245
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,799
the string is his necktie,

246
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,099
and the knot in the string.

247
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:18,399
You've got to be kidding.

248
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,099
His tie pin?

249
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,799
That's right.

250
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,299
When you look at the tie around Motoo's neck,

251
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,399
you'll see for yourself, it so obvious.

252
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,799
The reason his tie pin was so attached so low was

253
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,399
it was adjusted to accommodate this trick,

254
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,299
the hole the tie pin made was big proving

255
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,799
Motoo's weight stretched it out.

256
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,799
But wouldn't someone notice if the end of the neckties

257
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,899
were sticking out from above the left door?

258
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,399
Not if you were to roll it up

259
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,899
and stuff it into the space in the door.

260
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,399
Then when did he retrieve the piece of apron?

261
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,799
When the police arrived,

262
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,899
we didn't find anything like that in the cabinet.

263
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,799
Besides, he discovered Motoo's body

264
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,799
when all you students were present, didn't he?

265
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,399
He couldn't have retrieved it with all of you watching.

266
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,699
He certainly could.

267
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,399
When Motoo fell out of the cabinet,

268
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,799
Mr. Mino moved to the right side, bent down

269
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,999
and while he pretended to be trying to rouse him,

270
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,499
he opened the right door fully

271
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:27,499
and used his body to hide the apron

272
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:30,299
sticking out from under the door.

273
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,799
Then if he tore it tape and all,

274
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,199
no one would notice it, would they?

275
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,199
See, when the door is partially open...

276
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:43,399
The apron is hidden by the V shape joint on the inside

277
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,199
and when the door is opened fully,

278
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,599
it sticks out from the left side, doesn't it?

279
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,099
Mr. Mino tore that and hid it in his pocket.

280
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:56,399
Yes, I see what you mean.

281
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,499
Then we'd find that piece of cloth

282
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,499
if we search his pockets.

283
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,099
This is absurd.

284
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:06,799
Take a look. As you can see, I don't have such a thing.

285
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,999
What is this, Sonoko?

286
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,999
He probably hid it in the toilet or someplace

287
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:17,699
before the police arrived while I was checking the body.

288
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,099
In the toilet?

289
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:21,599
Conan saw Mr. Mino looking for scissors

290
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,499
so he probably meant to cut it into little pieces

291
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,299
and flush it down the toilet.

292
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,299
-Takagi, check it out. -Yes, sir!

293
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,099
It doesn't matter what and where you find it. I'm not guilty.

294
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:41,499
No one actually saw me hiding anything.

295
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,899
Besides, anyone could have rigged

296
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:48,499
the trick that girl just explained.

297
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:49,699
You're right.

298
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,899
Even if we do find the piece of apron,

299
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,499
the moment it left your person,

300
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:58,399
it lost its weight as evidence against you.

301
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,599
But unfortunately, Mr. Mino,

302
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:06,399
there's solid evidence remaining that incriminates you.

303
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,399
What?

304
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:11,399
It's on the back of the tie that was tied around Motoo's neck.

305
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,599
This is...

306
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,999
Scratch marks?

307
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,499
That's right.

308
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:23,599
It's from the soil that's embedded in Mr. Mino's fingertips.

309
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,199
It's not unthinkable for those scratch marks to be there.

310
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,099
Mr. Mino was making a tea cup with Conan

311
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,099
and judging from the position of the tie pin,

312
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,499
the necktie was just barely long enough

313
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:39,999
to keep the body suspended.

314
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:43,399
The only way he could avoid getting his fingerprints

315
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:46,499
on the tie pin while pulling the body up

316
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,499
and getting the tie pin over the door, was to grip the necktie tightly.

317
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,899
Mr. Mino, you made two mistakes.

318
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:56,599
First, you didn't use gloves.

319
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,099
Second,

320
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:02,599
you chose to use that necktie to pull the body up.

321
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,099
If you had used gloves,

322
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,899
you could have looped the tie pin with your fingers

323
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:09,299
and pulled the body up.

324
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,999
And if you had used string with a knot instead of the necktie...

325
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,199
you wouldn't have made those scratch marks.

326
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,399
Putting gloves on

327
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:26,999
makes it seem as if I were touching something dirty.

328
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,099
My late daughter gave that tie to him,

329
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:32,499
it was a symbol of her love for him.

330
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:35,199
It was for Christmas.

331
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,699
Then, the birthday card

332
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,399
and that tie he found in his bag yesterday...

333
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,899
It was from me.

334
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:48,099
I knew he'd assume it was from you.

335
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,999
I was determined to use it

336
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:53,099
to show him the grief my daughter felt.

337
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,599
And I wanted you to take all the blame.

338
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:59,799
I started to suspect the relationship between you two

339
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,799
when my daughter was struck by the truck and died, 2 years ago.

340
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,599
It was 3 days after Christmas.

341
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,799
The funeral was over and I was cleaning her room,

342
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,199
that's when I found it.

343
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,499
The necktie was crumpled

344
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,899
and thrown in the trash bin, box and all.

345
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,399
I thought he did it by mistake

346
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,699
so I rushed to the airport to give it to him.

347
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,199
I expected to see a man

348
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,299
grieving over the recent loss of his beloved wife

349
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,199
waiting sadly for his flight to take him to his work assignment.

350
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:38,499
But the man I saw at the airport wasn't a man

351
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,799
who had recently lost e woman he loved.

352
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,999
What I saw was a fraud. He was holding you

353
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,599
and you two were laughing and enjoying yourselves.

354
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:50,599
That's when I knew,

355
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,699
my daughter wasn't hit by the car.

356
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:57,399
She found out about you two

357
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,899
so she threw herself in front of the car, killing herself.

358
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:09,299
But how did you know this necktie was for Motoo?

359
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,599
Maybe she was going to give it to you.

360
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,399
I knew.

361
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,499
After all, she...

362
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,199
She told me.

363
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:24,399
Beige?

364
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,899
Isn't that color rather plain for Motoo?

365
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,399
It doesn't matter. I like beige and besides,

366
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,299
I want him to be a little more like you.

367
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,399
Beige is the color of the soil.

368
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,299
That's your color, isn't it, dad?

369
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,399
I guess

370
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:46,199
you could say it was a father's intuition.

371
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,799
"Three days later"

372
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,999
You got a letter from Kyogoku?

373
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:28,899
Then why are you so sad, Sonoko?

374
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:31,599
Take a look at this picture!

375
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,899
He thought you made him a vase.

376
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,399
I guess you could say I "vasted" my time.

377
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:42,299
Imbecile.

378
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:47,199
So? Ran, did you send yours to "you know who"?

379
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,199
What?

380
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,499
Didnt you have your friend the living national treasure

381
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,699
fire yours up for you?

382
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:54,699
Well, no. I don't think I did it right.

383
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,999
That's why I didn't send it.

384
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:59,299
I think they are all gone.

385
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,399
-Hey, Conan. -Huh?

386
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:05,499
I hate to ask, but could you go get the bag of chips on my desk?

387
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:07,299
Okie dokie.

388
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,099
What's this? It's a chopstick holder.

389
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,699
It looks familiar.

390
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,799
Mystery maniac is a complete fool?

391
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,399
I get it now. So this is the tea cup Ran made.

392
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:28,199
I understand why she couldn't send a silly tea cup like this.

393
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,799
I'll be waiting for you.

394
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,499
Conan, what are you doing?

395
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,199
Hurry up, we're waiting.

396
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,899
Yeah, coming!

397
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:49,099
Conan looks so happy.

398
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:50,899
Kind of creepy, isn't it?

399
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,499
"Next Episode"

400
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,499
I'm sure of it.

401
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,699
One of these three is part of their gang!

402
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,999
But did the gang find out?

403
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,399
How did they know I was acting suspicious?

404
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:30,599
Next Conan, "Mysterious Passenger (Part 1)"

405
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,817
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,717
"Message"

407
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,217
Conan's movie "Assassin in Your Eyes" will be aired on April 2nd.

408
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,517
Regular Conan programming will resume April 16th!
