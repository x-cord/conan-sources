1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,540
A girl detective?

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,440
Is she sniffing about around you?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,740
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,840
Her name is Masumi Sera.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,540
It seems that she's been living in the States

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,940
for the past three years with her parents, though.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,940
And she's come back to Japan alone this time.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,240
And, did you use Shinichi Kudo's voice in front of that girl

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,940
and solve a case?

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,640
Sort of.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
I kind of had no other option.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,840
Don't tell me that girl

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,240
is one of the members of the you-know-what organization.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,440
Oh, no. I don't think so.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,340
But...

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,340
I can't help feeling that I've met her somewhere before.

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,440
Really?

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,840
Quite frustrating.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay!

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,940
I've got some things to do there too

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,140
so I guess I'll go take a look at what she looks like!

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,640
If all cases were men,

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,940
Today, we spend 60 minutes with Heiji!

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,840
A serious deduction battle!

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,640
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,420
"Conan vs. Heiji"

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,920
"Deduction Battle Between the Detectives of The East and West"

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,020
What're you doing?

32
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,820
Acting clearly like a suspicious person or country bumpkin!

33
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,220
I can't help it!

34
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,220
The curry packet that mother asked me to buy for her

35
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,120
is sold exclusively only at family restaurants in Tokyo.

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,520
You don't have to look for it now, do you?

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Why not look for it later?

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,020
But, when we went to Nagano,

39
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,320
I ended up forgetting to buy Shinshu Miso too, you know?

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I don't want to miss the chance this time.

41
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm getting off, off here, let me off!

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,620
What's up?

43
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,520
I found the family restaurant!

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm going to stop by and get it,

45
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,520
so you go on ahead to Pops Kogoro's place!

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,720
Driver, let me off, quickly!

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,120
I mean this is not a taxi, you know.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,220
What makes you think that a bus can stop wherever you want it to.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,420
Hey, Kazuha.

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,020
See you, Heiji!

51
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh, hey, wait.

52
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,820
I tell you, that girl.

53
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,620
Huh? Are Heiji and Kazuha coming here?

54
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,820
Yes, I got a call last night.

55
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,920
I wonder what they're coming here?

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,420
Could it be a case or something?

57
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,720
I wonder. He said he'd tell me about it when he gets here.

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,820
He was also saying something about curry too.

59
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,220
Curry?

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,320
You mean, Hattori?

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,620
Who'd you say did a gorgeous hat trick?

62
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,120
Ms. Sera.

63
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,320
The son of the head of the Osaka Prefectural Police Station, eh?

64
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,520
And a high school detective too!

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,820
Why, that's fantastic!

66
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,020
Yes, and his name is Heiji Hattori!

67
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,920
According to Hattori, it seems that people refer to him side by side

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,120
as Hattori of the West and Kudo of the East!

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,620
So, he's Kudo's rival!

70
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,720
But, they seemed to have battled only in the beginning

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,120
and now they seem to be cooperating with each other to solve cases.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,920
In other words, they are full fledged when they work together.

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,020
They cannot come close to the ranking alongside

74
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,320
with Japan's greatest detective,

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,520
the Sleeping Kogoro, you see!

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,820
The Sleeping Kogoro is also two working together, you know?

77
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,020
And?

78
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,620
Why is this boy coming here for?

79
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
I don't know.

80
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,720
He said he'd tell us when he gets here.

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,820
He's probably going to

82
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,320
bring some complicated case along with him again.

83
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,420
I hope they cooperate nicely,

84
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,220
the west and the east detectives and solve the case.

85
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,020
East vs. West?

86
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,120
If you were to be honest,

87
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,620
which of the two are renowned detectives?

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,320
Oh, I think they are equal.

89
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
But...

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,720
if I had to make a choice,

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I think that the detective of the East.

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,920
It's the West!

93
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,120
I, Heiji Hattori, the high school detective of the west

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,720
is way above, I tell you, idiot!

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Saying what you like,

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
thinking that I'm not going to say anything, I tell you.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,420
You mean you were eavesdropping.

98
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,720
And? Where's the girl detective

99
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,120
that's suddenly appeared recently sniffing around about Kudo?

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,820
She's right here!

101
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,520
This is Masumi Sera!

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,920
It's not that I'm sniffing about or anything, though.

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,520
You're a girl?

104
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,920
But, for a girl, your boobies are sort of a bit teeny-weeny?

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,020
Well, it's scheduled to pop out

106
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,920
and get bigger from now on, you see!

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,020
Well, mom was seem to have been skinny too,

108
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,320
but seemed to have enough breast size, so I'm not worried, though!

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
Right, Ran?

110
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,520
I've never met her though.

111
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,020
By the way, where's Kazuha?

112
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,720
Wasn't she supposed to come with you?

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah, she got off the bus to go shopping.

114
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,020
Kazuha's mother seems to be hooked on the curry packet

115
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,720
that she received as a gift previously.

116
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,820
Moreover, it seems to be curry that

117
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,320
you can only buy exclusively at family restaurants in Tokyo,

118
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,320
that her mother asked her to buy it for her while she's here.

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,420
She happened to find that family restaurant on our way here.

120
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,720
So, she's coming here after dropping over there?

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Then, why did you come here, Heiji?

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Well, the fact is...

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Oh, sorry.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,020
It's from Kazuha.

125
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,120
What is it, Kazuha?

126
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,320
Did you already buy the curry?

127
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,620
Help, Heiji!

128
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,920
What's up?

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,520
Didn't you go to the family restaurant?

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm at that family restaurant but...

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,020
there's great commotion here

132
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,220
because somebody seems to have died in the restroom!

133
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Somebody died?

134
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,420
Is it a homicide?

135
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,920
I don't know yet.

136
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,720
A strange foreign man told us not to leave the store,

137
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,020
so I can't go out.

138
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,620
Okay! I'll be right over, so you wait there!

139
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,420
So, I guess I gotta go.

140
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,320
Okay, so why don't we do this?

141
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,520
How about deciding which is better,

142
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,420
the West or the East, with this case?

143
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,020
Of course, you work on your own, Heiji

144
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,120
and as for Kudo,

145
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,620
if Conan tells him the circumstances,

146
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,320
he can join the match, right?

147
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Well, I won't force you to do this

148
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,820
if you and Kudo are such good friends

149
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,420
that you don't want to battle against each other, but...

150
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,220
What're you talking about?

151
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,320
It's a great opportunity.

152
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,120
Let's decide, which one of us, Kudo or me is a great detective.

153
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,220
It's about time we make things clear!

154
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:38,228
Okay, then this is the story, right?

155
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:41,728
When Kazuha was buying the curry at the restaurant,

156
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:45,628
a foreign man suddenly came out of the restroom

157
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:49,028
and said that a man is dead so call the police, right?

158
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,528
Yes. The restroom's been closed off,

159
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:52,928
and we're told that just to be safe,

160
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,428
no one should leave the restaurant!

161
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,728
Did that foreigner say that in English?

162
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:00,328
It was in Japanese!

163
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,328
He was the first to find the dead man!

164
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:05,828
A guy who speaks fluent Japanese,

165
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,428
and the first to find the corpse.

166
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,528
That guy is suspicious.

167
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:13,028
Well, as far as we're concerned,

168
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:15,628
you guys who keep coming to the scene of the crime

169
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,128
every time something happens is even more suspicious, you see.

170
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:20,828
Inspector Megure!

171
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,328
Well, recently, as soon as we get to the crime site,

172
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:27,228
the officer takes it for granted that you called us

173
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:29,128
and lets us right through.

174
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:33,228
And what is the cause of death?

175
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:34,828
He was poisoned.

176
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,028
A candy drop laced with hydrogen cyanide

177
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:39,728
was found inside the mouth of the victim

178
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,228
and the same candy drop

179
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:43,328
was also found inside the pocket of the corpse.

180
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:46,128
So, it may be suicide, then?

181
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,628
Yes, the foreigner who found him said so.

182
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:54,128
Who is he? The foreigner.

183
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,528
He seems to be at home at the scene of the crime, so...

184
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:01,328
Well, I guess you can say he's sort of connected to the police.

185
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:03,628
So, you're here too.

186
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:07,628
A foreigner of large physique, who speaks fluent Japanese.

187
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:09,428
Someone who's used to places like these

188
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:12,528
and is connected to the police...

189
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,128
Oh! That foreigner is probably...

190
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:17,328
Yes.

191
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,728
I acted on impulse.

192
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:23,828
Just as I thought, Investigator Camel!

193
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:25,328
Investigator?

194
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:28,128
You mean you know this evil-looking foreigner?

195
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,328
Heiji!

196
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,928
How rude can you get being honest saying that

197
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,328
he's evil looking!

198
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:37,028
Kazuha, I think you're being just as rude...

199
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,428
More than that, what do you mean investigator?

200
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:40,928
He's an FBI agent!

201
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,128
FBI?

202
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:43,128
Yeah.

203
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,228
He's on vacation right now

204
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,328
and is in Japan on a trip right now, right?

205
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:48,928
Yeah.

206
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,928
I just couldn't forget the taste of the curry

207
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,828
that I ate with my friend when I was previously in Japan,

208
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:57,128
so I came to eat it alone, then I ran into this case.

209
00:10:57,128 --> 00:11:00,028
Is this curry that delicious?

210
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,828
Okay, so if it's okay with you,

211
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,128
I'd like you to give us the details of

212
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,128
when you found the corpse in the toilet.

213
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,628
Normally I'd refuse,

214
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:11,028
but since we're always indebted to you...

215
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:12,028
Camel!

216
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:14,928
Could you please explain the situation to them one more time?

217
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:18,428
Okay then, let's go to the restroom where the crime took place.

218
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,828
Oh?

219
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,828
The FBI.

220
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,328
Wasn't Mr. Camel with you?

221
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:44,628
Well, he said that he wanted to go eat the curry

222
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:48,028
that he ate at a family restaurant before and left.

223
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:52,028
Oh, is that curry that delicious?

224
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,528
Beats me, because I haven't eaten it.

225
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:00,928
Talk about the devil.

226
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,928
It's mail from Camel.

227
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:07,228
Is something the matter?

228
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,528
Well...

229
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:13,728
I tell you.

230
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,228
He didn't have to go

231
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:18,528
and commit suicide in a place like this of all places.

232
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:20,428
And?

233
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,828
Has this man been identified?

234
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:25,328
No, he had nothing on him

235
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,728
that would serve as identification.

236
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:30,028
The cell phone that would've served as evidence

237
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:32,928
was found floating in the water of the toilet.

238
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:35,428
Where were you, Agent Camel?

239
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,328
I was doing my thing

240
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:39,628
in that toilet compartment two doors away from here.

241
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,628
Then, what do you base your deduction

242
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,628
that this was a suicide on?

243
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:46,028
I heard a voice saying.

244
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:48,128
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

245
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,528
"I can't help you on that."

246
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:52,428
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-chan ate"

247
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:53,628
"and killed him."

248
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,728
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

249
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,428
As soon as he finished talking,

250
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:01,028
I heard a groan.

251
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:05,328
I rushed out of the toilet and this is what I saw.

252
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:09,028
So you rushed out of the toilet, closed this place off

253
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:11,828
and confined the customers in the store, eh?

254
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:12,928
Yes.

255
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,228
According to the contents of his conversation,

256
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,528
he seems to have been talking with someone from here.

257
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:19,428
Since he could've wanted to admit to his crime

258
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:22,428
and turn himself into the police,

259
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:27,328
that someone he was talking to could've tried to shut him up.

260
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:31,828
But, recalling that he was eating alone

261
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,628
and taking into consideration that

262
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:36,128
I couldn't hear the voice of the person

263
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:38,128
on the other side of the line.

264
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,328
The person on the other end

265
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:40,628
tried to stop the person from committing suicide,

266
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,728
but he probably didn't listen

267
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,228
and committed suicide

268
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:45,528
after repenting the murder he had committed

269
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,328
is what I conclude.

270
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,728
Was that voice really this man's voice?

271
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,928
No doubt about that.

272
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,028
This person's seat

273
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:57,228
just happened to be right in front of mine.

274
00:13:57,228 --> 00:14:00,028
He order it quite a loud voice.

275
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:03,428
So, I guess it is suicide.

276
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:04,928
Yes.

277
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,928
But, a case in which that Mr. Abe

278
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:10,928
was poisoned to death couldn't be found in Tokyo.

279
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:14,028
So, I'm having the other prefectures

280
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,328
check on this case for me right now.

281
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:17,728
I think that person called Abe

282
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:21,728
had quite intimate relationship with this person who died.

283
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,628
Because he used the suffix "chan" when calling him.

284
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:27,128
Then, you mean he said, "Abe-chan"?

285
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,328
Yeah.

286
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,828
Didn't you notice anything else?

287
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,128
Maybe you might not have been able to tell,

288
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:35,728
but whether he spoke with a dialect or something.

289
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,228
Come to think of it.

290
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:39,728
He talked just like this young man over here!

291
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,128
Huh? Me?

292
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,528
Are you saying he was speaking in the Kansai dialect then?

293
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:46,628
I don't know if you call it the Kansai dialect,

294
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:49,128
but he used the sounds "ya" and "de"

295
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:50,828
at the end of his sentences.

296
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:54,228
Then, that Abe-chan poisoned to death incident,

297
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,428
may have taken place in the Kansai District.

298
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,328
-Check it out right away! -Yes, sir!

299
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:03,928
What?

300
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:08,228
-Is something on my face or what? -Oh, no.

301
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:10,928
If you're wondering if I'm a boy or a girl,

302
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:13,228
the correct answer is, a girl!

303
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:19,728
Although my boobies aren't sticking out yet!

304
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:26,528
She sure looks familiar.

305
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,128
I wonder what's going on?

306
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,228
Beats me, a homicide?

307
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:31,828
I'm hungry.

308
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:33,228
Yes.

309
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,628
I wonder if Heiji and the others are still going to be taking a while.

310
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:36,928
Maybe.

311
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:40,228
Looking at the menu is making me drool, that this is bad.

312
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:43,228
Then would you like an ame-chan (candy drop)?

313
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:44,728
"Ame-chan"?

314
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,528
A candy drop!

315
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:51,228
Hey. Kudo.

316
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:54,928
How far do you have this case solved?

317
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,928
Not at all yet.

318
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:59,828
Well, but if an incident of a person called Abe

319
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,428
being poisoned to death is found in the Kansai District,

320
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,728
then we might find something.

321
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,328
I see.

322
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,928
If so, I'm a step in the lead!

323
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:15,428
You mean... don't tell me, you...

324
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:17,228
Yeah! I figured out that

325
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:21,228
the man didn't commit suicide but was killed.

326
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:25,728
And that the culprit is still inside this family restaurant!

327
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,950
It's not suicide?

328
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,450
Just how do you know?

329
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,450
That's because, Kudo...

330
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,850
I'm more of a great detective than you!

331
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,150
You idiot!

332
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,950
Okay, you're better than me,

333
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,950
so tell me your deduction!

334
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,350
Huh?

335
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,950
What was that?

336
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,250
Your voice is so soft, I couldn't hear very well.

337
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,250
Like I said, tell me why you think so.

338
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,250
It's what you said before that.

339
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,550
You're...

340
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,550
You're better than me.

341
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,950
Absolutely!

342
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,750
Unless, I who is way above you explains,

343
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,550
you can't understand, can you, sonny?

344
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,050
He really gets me mad.

345
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,150
Okay, then.

346
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,450
Try recalling carefully what happened during the time

347
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,150
-the incident occurred. -The situation.

348
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,750
When Agent Camel was doing his thing

349
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,850
in the toilet of the family restaurant,

350
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,950
he coincidentally heard the voice of a man

351
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,050
two doors away from where he was hinting on a possible suicide.

352
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,850
So he rushed over to check things out,

353
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,750
and found a man with a hydrogen cyanide laced candy drop

354
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,550
in his mouth lying dead, right?

355
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,750
What did the voice that hinted on possible suicide say?

356
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,050
Let's see.

357
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,050
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

358
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,250
"I can't help you on that."

359
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,450
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-san ate"

360
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,750
"and killed him."

361
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,050
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

362
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,850
It's not Abe-san, but Abe-chan!

363
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,350
Don't get it wrong!

364
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,150
It doesn't matter, does it?

365
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,650
Just tell me quick!

366
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,450
You already heard that the man spoke in a Kansai dialect, right?

367
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,650
Yeah.

368
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,850
If you say what was said just now in Kansai dialect,

369
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,150
it would be...

370
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,750
"No matter if you're my childhood friend,"

371
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,250
"I can't help you on that."

372
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,050
"I'm the one who laced poison on what Abe-chan ate"

373
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,450
"and killed him."

374
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,750
"So, I have to take responsibility for my actions."

375
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,150
Right, that's it. He spoke in that fashion!

376
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,050
What heard was exactly as he said it just now!

377
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,450
See? Just like I said, the only way you can look at it is,

378
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,150
the man who died, confessed that he poisoned someone to death

379
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,950
and committed suicide to take responsibility

380
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,850
for what he did, right?

381
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,250
Oh, well, no...

382
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,950
What he said just now probably...

383
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,250
If it was spoken in the Kansai dialect,

384
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,750
what he meant by "jibun"(me) was actually "you".

385
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,750
Huh? Why?

386
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,850
In Japanese the word "jibun" means "me", right?

387
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,650
Why does it mean "you?"

388
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,350
For example, the phrase, "Temaedomo no sekinin desu."

389
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,950
The word "temae" in this case means ourselves, but...

390
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,150
when you say "temae" is used in fighting,

391
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,450
you're addressing the opponent.

392
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,650
So you see, Japanese is a bit complicated!

393
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,450
In other words, if you replace "me" with "you"...

394
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,950
"You're the one who poisoned Abe-chan to death!"

395
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,150
"If so, you have no choice but to take responsibility for it!"

396
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,050
It would turn out like so...

397
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,150
So, the man that died

398
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,450
wasn't confessing that he committed a crime...

399
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,450
But was criticizing the other person whom commited the crime

400
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,750
and most likely was trying to persuade the person

401
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,150
to turn himself into the police.

402
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,250
By the way, the "motte" in the phrase

403
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,550
"Abe-chan ni doku motte" (laced what Abe-chan ate with poison).

404
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,950
Didn't you mistake it and hear it as, "nutte" (smear)?

405
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,550
Yeah.

406
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,450
But, it's strange that someone would smear poison on someone else,

407
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,050
so I thought you misheard the word.

408
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,050
If so, that Abe-chan is not a person's name

409
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,750
but rather, "ame-chan",

410
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,550
in other words, a candy drop!

411
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,650
A candy drop?

412
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,950
This candy drop is good, isn't it?

413
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,150
The guy who was found dead in the toilet

414
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,650
also had a candy drop in his mouth.

415
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,250
I see, so he misheard "ame-chan" for "Abe-chan".

416
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,650
They do sound alike for sure.

417
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,850
But...

418
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,450
why would anyone put the suffix "chan" on the word candy?

419
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,150
Like we've been saying, Japanese is complicated!

420
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,750
"Ame-chan" is only exclusively used in the Kansai District.

421
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,750
But if so,

422
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,850
doesn't that mean there was a culprit in the restroom

423
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,350
who made the man take the poisoned candy into his mouth?

424
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,350
Yeah.

425
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,050
The fact that this FBI agent

426
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,250
didn't hear the culprit's voice means that...

427
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,750
Most probably, he was scheduled to see the person

428
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,750
he was urging to turn himself in

429
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,550
but instead of sitting in the same seat, the culprit

430
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,950
called the man out to the toilet using the cell phone,

431
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,550
and later poisoned him to death!

432
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,650
If he succeeds in luring the man out using the cell phone,

433
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,950
all the culprit had left to do was to shove

434
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,650
the poisoned candy drop into the victim's mouth.

435
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,450
He wouldn't have to talk at all.

436
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,050
And if he sinks the cell phone into the toilet bowl,

437
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,950
the data would disappear too.

438
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,850
But, what the culprit didn't expect was that

439
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,650
an FBI agent coincidentally happened to be in that toilet

440
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,850
and swiftly confined the customers inside the store.

441
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,850
In other words,

442
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,850
the murderer is still inside this store, right?

443
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,150
Okay!

444
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,550
Narrow down the suspects to men in their 30's and 40's

445
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,450
and start interrogating them one by one!

446
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,250
If he is a childhood friend of the victim,

447
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,150
he would be about that age!

448
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,350
Yes, sir!

449
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,550
So...

450
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,050
I'm a step ahead of him so far!

451
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,250
Him?

452
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,250
I thought your match was with Kudo?

453
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,950
Like, I'm saying that

454
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,050
I'm more ahead than Kudo who is behind this brat!

455
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,950
This brat tells me about

456
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,850
the deductions Kudo tell him about with a sassy look

457
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,350
that I sometimes get the impression

458
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,750
that he's Kudo himself!

459
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,850
Well...

460
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,550
I'm sorry but I got this case.

461
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:42,050
If the culprit was the childhood friend of the man who fell victim,

462
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,650
the culprit is also probably from the Kansai area!

463
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,750
Therefore, even if there are things

464
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,850
that Kudo who is an Edoite cannot understand,

465
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,350
for me, who is from Kansai, it would be duck soup!

466
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,750
I tell you.

467
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,350
Camel really has a way of getting involved with all sorts of cases.

468
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,350
Yes.

469
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,250
We're investigating secretly without telling

470
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,950
the Japanese police of what we're doing and yet...

471
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,550
Huh? From Camel?

472
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,650
Yes.

473
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,950
But the only thing he sent is a photo from his cell phone.

474
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,550
A boy?
