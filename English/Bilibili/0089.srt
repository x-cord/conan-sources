1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,470
A racing second hand,
shining shooting stars!

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,050
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,800
Today is the Dracula solution!
The trick is exposed before sunrise!

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,350
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,350
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,060
His name?

7
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:38,549
The old man was hired by Mr. Dorakura,
owner of Dracula Manor,

8
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,259
to investigate his wife's infidelity.

9
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,549
That night, someone killed
Mr. Dorakura with a stake to the heart,

10
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,759
in his completely-locked study room!

11
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,599
To get to the study, one would
have to pass through the living room,

12
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,649
where everyone was at the time!

13
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,109
Breaking in from
outside was also impossible!

14
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,089
Did the killer fly through
the air, like a vampire?!

15
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,119
"The Dracula Manor Murder Case Part 2."

16
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,619
My, what a farce that was.

17
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:22,209
That's the roof above
the collection room...

18
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,489
What are those imprints in the snow?

19
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,259
Wait a minute!

20
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,299
The collection room didn't smell
like oil paint after the incident!

21
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,799
Does that mean...

22
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,569
Huh?! It doesn't smell!

23
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,119
Hey, you!

24
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:51,409
What're you doing?

25
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,909
Nothing!

26
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,079
Was that stake not
the source of the smell?

27
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,879
Let's first organize what
we know about the incident.

28
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,339
First, at around 8:30,
Mr. Dorakura went to the study

29
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:11,529
and Tadokoro-san, Ran, and Conan
went to the collection room

30
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,469
to get a film.

31
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,979
At that time, the stake used as
the murder weapon was still there.

32
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,189
In other words, the killer
stole the stake after that.

33
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,659
Moreover, Ran confirmed that all
the windows in the collection room

34
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,819
had been locked from the inside.

35
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,789
In short, the only way into the
room was from the living room.

36
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:39,499
Next, Tadokoro-san went to the
study to deliver the wine and movie.

37
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:45,779
Yes. At around 8:50, I left the
wine and film and left the study.

38
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:46,879
Huh?

39
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,339
The wine bottle's
seal hasn't been broken.

40
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:53,489
Did anything seem
odd about Mr. Dorakura then?

41
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,269
No, not really.

42
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,309
You returned to the living
room shortly after 9:00,

43
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,859
then left to make sure
that everything was locked up.

44
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,279
Yes. I believe I returned
ten minutes afterward.

45
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,449
The snow had already stopped by then.

46
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,289
Shortly after, his wife
retired to her room upstairs.

47
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,829
Around 9:15, I'd say?

48
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,959
And then she came down when
the body was found around midnight.

49
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,999
In short, she has no
alibi for that period of time.

50
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,359
Hamura-san.

51
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:31,969
You left the living room the same
time she did, to go to the library.

52
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,559
Yes. I returned to the
living room at about 10:30.

53
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:38,599
Which means I have no
alibi for that period of time.

54
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,309
You had the opportunity to steal
the stake from the collection room.

55
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:50,449
Doi-san. Right after Hamura-san
returned to the living room,

56
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,109
you went to the restroom.

57
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,909
You were gone about twenty
minutes, wouldn't you say?

58
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:56,869
Y-Yes.

59
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:00,159
Twenty minutes is enough
time to commit the murder.

60
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:03,419
But I never went
to the collection room.

61
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,089
Yeah! Doi-san only
went to the bathroom!

62
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:10,339
He even bumped into
Hamura-san on his way!

63
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,889
That's right! I didn't think of that!

64
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,719
Hamura-san. Perhaps you secretly
had the stake when that happened?

65
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,479
And then Doi-san pretended
to bump into you and took it.

66
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,109
Quit joking around! Why would
I need to kill Dorakura-sensei?!

67
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,699
What's this?

68
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,489
T-That's...

69
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:34,469
'Call of Darkness', by Nakajima Yoshihiko

70
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:35,449
These aren't Mr. Dorakura's manuscripts...
'Call of Darkness', by Nakajima Yoshihiko

71
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,369
These aren't Mr. Dorakura's manuscripts...

72
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:44,549
Could they be novels submitted
to Doi-san's magazine by readers?

73
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:48,419
See, it says "Horror Times"
on the envelope.

74
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:52,169
Come to think of it,
I have heard an odd rumor,

75
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,169
from my university's
Horror Novel Association,

76
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,429
that novels submitted
to the Horror Times

77
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,389
wound up being
plagiarized by Dorakura.

78
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,129
Plagiarized?

79
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,169
Don't tell me you were involved
with this too, Editor-in-Chief?

80
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,939
W-What makes you think--

81
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,459
In that case, we can compare
Dorakura's manuscripts on this PC

82
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,709
with these submitted novels.

83
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,619
T-That's...

84
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,169
Doi-san.

85
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,329
It'd be in your best interest
to come clean while you still can.

86
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:32,549
Dorakura... His talent had
been dried up for years now.

87
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,639
About seven years ago,

88
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,509
I failed in the stock market and
found myself in incredible debt.

89
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:47,449
Dorakura offered to take over
my debt if I would leak novels to him.

90
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:53,129
So, you murdered him to
dissolve your relationship, then?

91
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,509
N-No!

92
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,859
But you have a motive!

93
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:01,449
If it's motives you want,
Tadokoro-kun has one, too!

94
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,999
He was Dorakura's ghostwriter!

95
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,919
Ghostwriter?!

96
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,339
It was five years ago.

97
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:15,379
No longer able to endure leaking
him novels submitted to me,

98
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,049
I introduced him to Tadokoro-kun,

99
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,879
who I learned of through
literary magazines.

100
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,259
Come to think of it,

101
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:26,379
didn't Mr. Dorakura start publishing
fantasy works five years ago?

102
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,979
Tadokoro-kun wrote them.

103
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,519
Is this true, Tadokoro-san?!

104
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,759
It's true.

105
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,339
But I don't bear a
grudge against him for it.

106
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:44,159
Even if I did, there's
a reason I couldn't kill him!

107
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,869
A reason you couldn't kill him?

108
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,669
I have a sister named Kaori,
who's ten years younger than me.

109
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,379
She was born with
a slightly-faulty heart,

110
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,339
and as our parents
died when she was young,

111
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,299
I wasn't able to get
her decent medical help.

112
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:04,459
But, thanks to Dorakura-sensei,
she's now in a hospital in Tokyo.

113
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:09,959
He offered to pay Kaori's
medical and hospital fees

114
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,269
if I became his ghostwriter.

115
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:19,819
So, killing Mr. Dorakura would
cut off your sister's treatment...

116
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,569
Yes.

117
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,909
Mr. Dorakura sure
was one horrible man.

118
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,119
A true vampire.

119
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:35,589
Even if the victim was as merciless
as a vampire, murder is murder!

120
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,049
It can't be forgiven.

121
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:45,209
I guess, unless Hamura-san
worked with one of the other two,

122
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,099
the murder would've been impossible.

123
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:52,589
But, the only way to get to the
only corridor is from the living room.

124
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,609
It'd be impossible to sneak past us all.

125
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,989
Even if it was possible, the study
room was locked from the inside.

126
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:05,029
The door had a rubber seal,
so outside tricks would be impossible.

127
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,299
And, if the window was
used to enter and exit,

128
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,749
only the snow in front
of the window had footprints.

129
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,299
The weapon was the wooden
stake in the collection room,

130
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,419
so the killer was someone
in Dracula Manor tonight.

131
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,549
Wait! Why did the person
kill him with the stake?

132
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,429
That limited the suspects
to those inside the building.

133
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,139
That would be very bad for the killer!

134
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:32,339
Yet... why did they
dare to use that weapon?

135
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,179
Could it be that...

136
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,529
I knew it! There's a
slight smell of oil paint left!

137
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,239
The windows were locked from the inside.

138
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,909
The small ventilation
windows have spring stoppers...

139
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,749
The twig piece I found
on the floor under the window...

140
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:03,179
And the strange imprints in the
snow on the roof above the window...

141
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:07,799
There's gotta be a connection! What is it?!

142
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,669
That's it! So, that's the deal!

143
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,239
What's this plastic bag?

144
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,119
This is...

145
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,659
There's gotta be a secret
passageway here somewhere!

146
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,119
There's nothing of the sort!

147
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,799
I have a good idea who's behind this.

148
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,089
But there's still a big mystery left!

149
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,759
Just how did the killer manage to...

150
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,049
Come to think of it,

151
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,009
why did the killer use the
projector to light up the body?

152
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,519
Was it just to recreate
the last scene of the movie?

153
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,849
What's that?

154
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,279
Tape? What's it doing here?

155
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,029
This is...

156
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,329
That's it! I know the real reason
why the killer lit up the body!

157
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,119
Now, I see the truth behind this case!

158
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,921
Dammit! There's no secret passage!

159
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,381
Hamura-san! Ma'am! Doi-san!

160
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:35,841
Don't tell me there's
a real vampire among you!

161
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:39,811
A vampire would be able to
fly to the study room and back!

162
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:44,061
Dear me. You appear to
be exhausted, Mori-san.

163
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:48,521
Take a nice nap and leave
the rest to me, old man!

164
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,321
Here we go again...

165
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:57,461
Let's return to our rooms, too.

166
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:59,331
Not so fast!

167
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:04,001
I was merely joking before.
Now, it's time to get down to business.

168
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,211
Down to business?

169
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,001
Are you suggesting you've
discovered the truth to this incident?

170
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,461
Of course I am.

171
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,711
Really?!

172
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,381
Yes. All of it.

173
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,761
Let us hear your theory then, Mori-san.

174
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:23,161
First, the wooden stake
used as the murder weapon.

175
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:27,481
I thought only Hamura-san
could have taken the stake,

176
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,691
but actually, anyone could
have stolen it from outside!

177
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,581
From outside?

178
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,901
There wasn't a single footstep
in the snow outside, you know.

179
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:41,371
There were no footprints because
the killer walked through the air.

180
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,121
Walked through the air?

181
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,581
Is this another of your jokes?

182
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:51,001
Were you aware that the window
by the entrance hall is as high up

183
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:55,211
as the roof above
the collection room window?

184
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:59,211
The killer used that fact to
make a bridge...

185
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,801
using a ladder.

186
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,141
A ladder?

187
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,221
Yes.

188
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:07,871
Walking across it, the killer could
get to the collection room window

189
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,521
without leaving any footsteps.

190
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:14,321
As proof, there are ladder
marks on the snow on the roof.

191
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,621
But, the windows were locked...

192
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:21,491
They could easily be
opened with a simple little trick.

193
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:24,451
By sticking the twig piece Conan found

194
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:29,251
between the ventilation
window's stopper and the glass.

195
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,831
This way, the stopper
will look like it's set,

196
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,541
but the window can
still be opened freely.

197
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,261
The killer stole the stake from there.

198
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:44,221
Afterward, simply closing the
window would make the stopper lock.

199
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:50,731
But, Mori-san! The stake was
two meters from that window!

200
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,521
The killer used a tree pruner.

201
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,691
You used one this afternoon,
Tadokoro-san.

202
00:13:56,691 --> 00:14:02,411
There are attachments
for those for picking fruit.

203
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,161
The killer attached one and stuck
it through the ventilation window

204
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,911
to steal the stake.

205
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:12,751
Using this method, anyone
could have obtained the stake.

206
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,091
You can't be serious...

207
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:18,741
But, Mori-san, how did the
person go to the study and back?

208
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:23,511
Simple, by crossing the corridor.

209
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:27,221
What are you talking about?
That's absolute nonsense.

210
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,041
Is it?

211
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:33,981
Isn't it much more logical than
having the killer fly through the air?

212
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:40,611
You were in the living room, too.
You know no one used the corridor.

213
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:44,371
Oh, but one person did.

214
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,281
Yes. The killer...

215
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,041
was you, Tadokoro Toshiya-san!

216
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:50,621
Tadokoro-kun?

217
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,751
T-That can't be!

218
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,911
W-What are you talking about?!

219
00:14:54,911 --> 00:15:00,081
The stake was still in the collection
room when I went to the study!

220
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,141
Isn't that right?!

221
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:04,051
That's true, Dad!

222
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:09,271
Ran, what you two saw was
an elaborately-made fake.

223
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,721
A fake?!

224
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:11,851
Yes.

225
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:15,901
When Tadokoro-san went to get
the film, he invited you and Conan

226
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:22,571
and showed you the stake, so you
would confirm it had been there.

227
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:25,581
Then, after killing Mr. Dorakura
with the real stake,

228
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:28,581
which he had hidden
in the study in advance,

229
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:34,921
he pretended to check all
the locks and stole the fake stake.

230
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:40,591
But, Mori-san. Do you have
proof the stake was a fake?

231
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,551
What's this?

232
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:48,511
This turned up after I instructed
Conan to look through the storeroom.

233
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,831
Yes, it's very well-made.

234
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,401
Was the fake blood
added using oil paint?

235
00:15:56,401 --> 00:16:01,861
His wife does oil painting, so it
would've been easy to get the paint.

236
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,671
Tadokoro-kun...

237
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:13,791
Mori-san. Even if he did use
the corridor to reach the study,

238
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,371
how did he get inside?

239
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:19,961
It was locked from the inside,
so he couldn't have gone out the door.

240
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:24,381
And if he left through the window,
how did he return to the corridor?

241
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,891
There were no other footprints,
except those in front of the window.

242
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:33,641
The open window and the trampled
snow were simply a red herring.

243
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:37,851
Tadokoro-san entered
and exited through the door.

244
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:41,571
Then how could I have
locked it from the outside?!

245
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,751
Locking the door is no problem at all...

246
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,531
if you use that projector, that is!

247
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,531
Projector?

248
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:56,251
W-What are you talking about?
How could a projector do that?

249
00:16:56,251 --> 00:17:00,251
Tadokoro-san,
I've figured it all out, you know...

250
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,461
Including why you lit up the body.

251
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:08,131
Wasn't it to recreate
the last scene of the movie?!

252
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:09,961
No, it wasn't.

253
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:15,121
The body was lit up to
camouflage the real reason

254
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,101
for moving the projector!

255
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,231
The real reason?

256
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,871
For this trick to work,

257
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:25,411
it was absolutely vital to move
the projector in front of the door.

258
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:30,291
But, the trick would be obvious
if only the projector were moved.

259
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:35,581
So, by lighting up the body as
a bit of an informed performance,

260
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,911
our attention was diverted.

261
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,331
I'll now reenact this trick I speak of.

262
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:42,231
Ran. Lend me a hand.

263
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:43,891
Yes! Okay!
Ran. Lend me a hand.

264
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:45,001
Yes! Okay!

265
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:49,261
First, pull about five
meters of film from the reel.

266
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:49,981
Right!

267
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:57,771
Next, stick a piece of
tape on the end of the film.

268
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:03,071
After that, throw the film over
the blackout curtain rail by the door,

269
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:05,721
and attach it to the lock on the door.

270
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,401
All done, Dad!

271
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,621
Now everything is set.

272
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:16,831
Ran. Start the projector.

273
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:17,751
Right!

274
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:45,981
This is how Tadokoro-san
locked the door.

275
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:51,121
But, unfortunately for him,
as the film was being pulled in,

276
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:56,201
the piece of tape caught on
the curtain rail and remained there.

277
00:18:56,411 --> 00:19:02,161
On the piece of tape are small,
square marks... from perforations.

278
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:05,881
The square holes in
the film, in other words.

279
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:10,711
Tadokoro-san, can you
give any other explanation

280
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:15,841
as to why that perforation-marked
tape was stuck on the curtain rail?

281
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:17,711
W-Well...

282
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:21,331
I think it's about
time you tell us the truth.

283
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:28,041
You already confessed you were
the killer when the body was found.

284
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:32,251
At the time, you said
you could hear the projector.

285
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,321
Don't you find that strange?

286
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:38,251
The door had airtight,
sound-proof rubber sealing.

287
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:41,871
How could you hear
what was happening inside?

288
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:47,171
You knew that the
projector was on inside.

289
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:55,851
Or, shall we see if the projector is
audible behind the closed door?

290
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,761
I... killed him.

291
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,621
Tadokoro-san...

292
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:09,481
But why would you kill Dorakura-san?!
What about your sister?!

293
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:17,911
My sister... Kaori... has
been dead for a year now...

294
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,371
That can't be...

295
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:27,041
Dorakura never gave
Kaori real medical treatment.

296
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:34,041
He paid off her doctor so she
would get neither better nor worse.

297
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,251
Just to keep Kaori hospitalized longer.

298
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:44,711
But, then her condition suddenly
took a turn for the worse, and she...

299
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:49,211
I only found out about
this one month ago.

300
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:53,281
Dorakura kept my sister's
death secret the entire time!

301
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:58,451
I believed his lie about sending her
to a better hospital in America...

302
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:01,751
But, one month ago...

303
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:10,291
Kaori's nurse couldn't bear it
anymore and secretly came to tell me.

304
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,851
She said Kaori deliriously cried
my name over and over as she died...

305
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,291
If she had, had real treatment...

306
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:25,681
If she had had real treatment,
that never would've happened!

307
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,911
Dorakura murdered Kaori!

308
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:32,751
That's why... That's why I...

309
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:47,001
They say a vampire's bite can turn
a normal person into a vampire.

310
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:52,461
Unknowingly, Tadokoro-san might
have become a vampire himself.

311
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:55,751
A vampire known as a murderer...

312
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,711
Franken Manor?!

313
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:30,011
Yeah. It belongs to Furano Kenzo,
an engineering professor.

314
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,861
Apparently, he conducts strange
experiments every night and--

315
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,701
This time it's Frankenstein...

316
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:41,701
Now we just need
a wolfman and we're all set.

317
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:48,531
Mr. Shiraki!

318
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:53,161
Something's not right!
What could it be?!

319
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:54,251
Wait a minute!

320
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:57,631
When he was in the dressing room,
the flower on his chest was--

321
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:02,511
If Okano Rika-san is the killer,
who will she go after next?!

322
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:02,514
If Okano Rika-san is the killer,
who will she go after next?!
This is bad!
Who is she trying to kill?!

323
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:05,671
This is bad!
Who is she trying to kill?!

324
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:05,674
This is bad!
Who is she trying to kill?!
Who is it?!
I'm not gonna make it in time!

325
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:07,676
Who is it?!
I'm not gonna make it in time!

326
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:12,621
On the next Conan:
"The Flower Scent Murder Case."
