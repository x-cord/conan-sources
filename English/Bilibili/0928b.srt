1
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.466
Hello?

2
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.066
Agata, how long are you going to make me wait?

3
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.966
Wait? What are you talking about?

4
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.166
What?

5
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:27.066
You just sent me a message saying you killed Nishiki and Ihaya,

6
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.766
and wanted to talk to me at the Kiyomizu butai

7
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.266
before the police arrested you.

8
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.666
What? I'd never send that.

9
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.366
Did you check the sender's address?

10
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.766
Hold on.

11
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:46.666
The sender's address is "chestnut@..."

12
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.666
Chestnut...

13
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.366
Doesn't "kuri" mean chestnut?

14
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.766
Isn't that Dekuri's address?

15
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.366
That's right.

16
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.866
I'm the one who sent the message.

17
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.766
Me, Dekuri.

18
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.466
That's impossible!

19
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.166
You're dead.

20
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.866
That's right.

21
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.566
After your betrayal,

22
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.066
in my despair, I threw myself from the Kiyomizu butai

23
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.566
and killed myself.

24
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.766
But...

25
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.566
In order to get my revenge,

26
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:23.166
I've returned from the underworld.

27
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.366
How could you trick me like that?

28
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.466
I'll never forgive you. Never.

29
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.766
I'll never forgive you!

30
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.566
No!

31
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.566
Your name was actually...

32
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.166
Apologize to Dekuri

33
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.766
in hell!

34
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.766
Why?

35
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:57.566
The butai is approximately 12 meters tall.

36
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.566
If you lay out a cushion beforehand,

37
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:06.566
you won't end up in the underworld,

38
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.866
Riki Agata.

39
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.266
How did you know I'd be here?

40
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.266
Did you crack the code?

41
00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.866
Yes. The key is the white cross-shape surrounded

42
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.466
by four black squares at the top of the ciphers.

43
00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:27.966
These refer to the Kamigyo, Nakagyo, Shimogyo, Sakyo,

44
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.966
and Ukyo Wards of Kyoto.

45
00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.566
The rest of the characters

46
00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:34.066
are parts of location names in Kyoto.

47
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.266
Comparing them against the positions

48
00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:36.966
of the characters in the white cross

49
00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:41.566
tells you which location name they refer to and how to read them.

50
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.566
Using that method,

51
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.066
the beginning of the cipher sent to Nishiki contains...

52
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.566
"Kon" from Kamigyo Ward's Kontaka-cho.

53
00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.366
"Ro" from Nakagyo Ward's Toroyama-cho.

54
00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:57.166
"Suji" from Kamigyo Ward's Sujikaibashi-cho.

55
00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.366
"No" from Ukyo Ward's Adashino.

56
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.366
"Hate" from Sakyo Ward's Kamihate-cho.

57
00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:05.766
If you string the first mora in each character together,

58
00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:09.166
you get "ko-ro-su-no-ha".

59
00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:12.266
In other words, it becomes "I will kill".

60
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:15.866
The backwards character for "saki" that appears occasionally

61
00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.666
is the "pon" from Nakagyo Ward's Ponto City.

62
00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.566
If you flip them around, you get "nop",

63
00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.666
so you read it as just "n".

64
00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.866
So the meaning of the first cipher is,

65
00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:31.366
"I will kill three, starting with the scriptwriter."

66
00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:34.866
If you read the second cipher

67
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:36.666
found on Nishiki's body in the same way,

68
00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:41.066
you get "two more to kill, next is the star".

69
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:42.766
The third cipher reads,

70
00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:48.566
"one more to kill, then I'll fall from the butai."

71
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.966
After making Mayama's death look like a suicide,

72
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.566
you probably intended to announce you figured out how to read the code,

73
00:03:55.566 --> 00:04:00.666
making it look like the third cipher was Mayama's suicide note,

74
00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:03.566
but because you wrote where you'd commit suicide,

75
00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:07.066
we were able to beat you here.

76
00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.366
It... it's the curse.

77
00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:11.066
It's the curse!

78
00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:15.866
It's some curse that made me do all of this!

79
00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:19.866
Didn't you see the ceiling in Nishiki's room?

80
00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.466
A human couldn't have done that in less than ten minutes.

81
00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:24.866
Electrostatic notes.

82
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:26.566
By using static electricity,

83
00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:31.166
they can be stuck to any wall or object without an adhesive.

84
00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:36.366
You used the notes Nishiki used to revise the script.

85
00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:42.066
You started by staying in that room the day before

86
00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.966
and painting the blood spray and footprints on the ceiling,

87
00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:46.266
allowing them to dry.

88
00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:51.066
You hid them by covering the entire ceiling with electrostatic notes.

89
00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:55.766
Naturally, you reserved that smoking room for the next day as well.

90
00:04:56.866 --> 00:05:01.166
You also reserved every other smoking room,

91
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.066
and canceled your reservation for the room painted with blood

92
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:07.066
when Nishiki called the hotel...

93
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:13.266
allowing you to force Nishiki to stay in that room.

94
00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.766
After killing Nishiki,

95
00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:20.766
you ran a rod over the ceiling to remove the notes

96
00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:23.966
and scattered Nishiki's script among them

97
00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:26.166
in order to conceal your trick.

98
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:29.866
Then you sucked some of Nishiki's blood into a syringe

99
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:31.966
and sprayed it at the center of the blood spray

100
00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:34.266
you painted on the ceiling.

101
00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:37.266
What about the tengu, then?

102
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:41.366
What about the giant tengu that suddenly appeared

103
00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.166
and vanished in my room?

104
00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:46.366
You were the only one who was useful

105
00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:48.966
when you helped Dekuri with his comics.

106
00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:54.166
Surely, you were artistic and dexterous enough to build

107
00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:57.566
a paper mache tengu of about that size.

108
00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:01.766
If you made it using the flash paper magicians use,

109
00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:03.466
just being exposed to the flame of a cigarette

110
00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:06.366
would make it go up in flames.

111
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.366
The three centimeter cigarette burn left in your room proves it.

112
00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:13.866
If you screamed when you noticed the tengu

113
00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:16.366
after lighting a cigarette

114
00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:19.966
and waited to throw your ashtray at the tengu

115
00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:22.166
after we arrived and opened the door...

116
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:26.566
then it doesn't make sense for so much of your cigarette to have remained.

117
00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:28.366
In other words,

118
00:06:28.366 --> 00:06:32.866
you lit your cigarette just before we opened the door,

119
00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:35.566
even though you should have been too surprised

120
00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.166
by the tengu to do that.

121
00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:40.466
Additionally, you painted the footprints

122
00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:44.066
on the inuyarai present at Ihaya's murder during the night,

123
00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:48.766
and placed a larger inuyarai over it.

124
00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.366
After killing him,

125
00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:54.266
you removed that inuyarai, revealing the footprints,

126
00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:57.166
and placed it over a different inuyarai.

127
00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:01.166
Apparently, they found all kinds of stuff under that inuyarai,

128
00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:02.666
like the murder weapon

129
00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:06.166
and a raincoat covered in the victim's blood.

130
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:08.166
You probably wiped your prints from them

131
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:12.166
so you could make it look like Mayama did it, though.

132
00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.866
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.066
Weren't you watching?

134
00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:18.766
Mayama was trying to climb over this railing!

135
00:07:18.766 --> 00:07:20.766
He must've been possessed by...

136
00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:22.566
No.

137
00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:26.066
All that's here are these clear electrostatic notes

138
00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:29.566
with red footprints painted on them.

139
00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:33.866
If you layered notes the same color as the floorboards over them,

140
00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:36.666
you could hide the footprints.

141
00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:39.666
Because you attached nylon string to them

142
00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:42.066
and removed them one at a time,

143
00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:46.966
it looked to Mayama like the bloody footprints were approaching him.

144
00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:51.266
Additionally, you used this directional speaker

145
00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:54.666
so only Mayama would hear this horrifying voice.

146
00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:55.666
I'll never forgive you.

147
00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:58.666
It's no wonder he was desperate to get away.

148
00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.766
Since you probably planned to retrieve the notes

149
00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:05.566
and speaker during the commotion caused by his suicide,

150
00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:09.166
your fingerprints should be on them.

151
00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:10.766
Darn it!

152
00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:12.366
Move, you brats!

153
00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:19.766
Sorry.

154
00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.166
He asked the Kyoto police to wear their old school uniforms

155
00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:24.966
and pretend to be students on a trip

156
00:08:24.966 --> 00:08:29.266
so you wouldn't be on your guard.

157
00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:31.066
No way.

158
00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.266
Gosh.

159
00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:34.366
Gosh!

160
00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:38.066
I don't get it, though.

161
00:08:38.066 --> 00:08:41.566
Why did you put two bumps on the bodies?

162
00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:44.066
It's the Kobutori Jisan folktale.

163
00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:47.066
The bad man incurred the wrath of a tengu

164
00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:51.466
when he copied the good man and was given two bumps.

165
00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:56.166
When I saw the bumps Keiko got during filming,

166
00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:59.666
I decided to incorporate it into my plan.

167
00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:05.466
Was your motive the absence of Dekuri's name in the credits?

168
00:09:05.466 --> 00:09:07.166
Yeah.

169
00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.466
When I told them during the after-party

170
00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:14.866
that Dekuri sat stunned in the theater, they said,

171
00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:17.466
"Really? He was that surprised?"

172
00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:20.466
"We did it. Well done, everyone."

173
00:09:20.466 --> 00:09:24.266
But wasn't it a mistake?

174
00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:25.766
I thought so, too,

175
00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:29.266
but was perplexed after I checked with the staff.

176
00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:31.966
They said they fixed the credits,

177
00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:34.166
but instead of removing someone's name,

178
00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:37.266
they just adjusted the spacing of some characters.

179
00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:42.166
They never intended to include Dekuri's name!

180
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.966
They only invited Dekuri to the screening

181
00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:45.566
so they could laugh at him!

182
00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:48.366
You're wrong, Agata!

183
00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:51.566
They had to fix the spacing of the characters!

184
00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:53.166
It's too late for that.

185
00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.766
Agata.

186
00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:58.766
These are the credits that were supposed to appear after the movie.

187
00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:03.166
We had all five of our names displayed at once,

188
00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.266
changed our names,

189
00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:09.066
and unevenly spaced our names

190
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:14.766
so the name "Michio Dekuri" would appear with ours.

191
00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:20.266
No...

192
00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:24.266
We wanted his name to appear as the author of the original work,

193
00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:28.266
but our producers said they couldn't pay another staff member,

194
00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:30.166
so we did this instead.

195
00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:31.966
Since he loved ciphers so much,

196
00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:35.066
we thought he'd notice.

197
00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:39.166
We did the same thing in our graduation project.

198
00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:42.366
We wanted to express our gratitude to him.

199
00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:44.966
We didn't tell you since you and Dekuri were friends.

200
00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:48.166
We wanted you to be surprised together.

201
00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:50.466
We're sorry.

202
00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:54.066
What have I done?

203
00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:05.466
Kiyomizu Temple trembled with the remorseful wail of the killer,

204
00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:09.466
as though the red leaves surrounding it

205
00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:12.166
had gone up in flames and withered.

206
00:11:16.466 --> 00:11:18.266
They're late.

207
00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:19.866
Yeah.

208
00:11:19.866 --> 00:11:21.166
Oh, they're here.

209
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.766
Shinichi!

210
00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.266
Sorry I'm late.

211
00:11:26.266 --> 00:11:29.166
-Did you catch the culprit? -Yeah.

212
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.866
But you don't need to worry about it.

213
00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:33.066
What's your problem?

214
00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:37.266
We changed our plans so we could meet up with you.

215
00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:39.666
It was an unpleasant case.

216
00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.666
Anyway, we still have some time.

217
00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:43.366
Should we go somewhere?

218
00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.166
Let's go to Kitano Tenmangu.

219
00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:47.566
Okita mentioned it before.

220
00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:49.566
Nice. Let's go.

221
00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:53.066
It's pretty far away.

222
00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:54.566
How do we get there?

223
00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:57.266
Hey.

224
00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:58.966
How do you feel?

225
00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:00.066
About what?

226
00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:01.766
About me.

227
00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:04.966
I heard you met with Okita yesterday.

228
00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:11.266
You haven't forgotten that I confessed my feelings to you in London...

229
00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:33.533
I heard you met with Okita yesterday.

230
00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:37.033
You haven't forgotten that I confessed my feelings to you in London...

231
00:12:49.633 --> 00:12:51.533
That's my answer.

232
00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.833
Is that not good enough?

233
00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:58.233
You...

234
00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:01.633
You can't do that.

235
00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:06.733
Not on the cheek.

236
00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:24.833
Be still, my heart.

237
00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.133
Listen to me, just this once.

238
00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:36.133
Wait, which is this?

239
00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:38.233
Which heartbeat is this?

240
00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:43.133
Gosh! I knew it was this one!

241
00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:44.833
Shinichi?

242
00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:50.033
Sorry, Ran. A case is calling me.

243
00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:52.033
I'll see you later.

244
00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:53.533
Shinichi!

245
00:13:55.933 --> 00:13:59.733
Seriously? He even had you waiting for a kiss.

246
00:13:59.733 --> 00:14:01.333
You were watching?

247
00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.633
Well, yeah.

248
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.633
What did he say?

249
00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:09.533
He said he got a call from a case.

250
00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:13.833
But he didn't look well.

251
00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:15.133
What?

252
00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:18.933
Sera.

253
00:14:20.133 --> 00:14:23.533
What? A high school student who had a hard time walking?

254
00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:27.133
Yeah, a male high school student who looks like this.

255
00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:30.133
Did he pass through the Todoroki-mon?

256
00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:31.733
I'm not sure.

257
00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:34.933
I don't look at every student who comes through here.

258
00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:36.933
I see.

259
00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:41.433
If you're looking for Kudo, he just went running that way.

260
00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:44.033
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

261
00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:46.633
Really? The bathroom?

262
00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:50.933
By the way, what's with the backpack?

263
00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:53.233
Why wouldn't I have a backpack?

264
00:14:53.233 --> 00:14:55.033
It looks pretty heavy.

265
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:57.233
Can I check what's inside?

266
00:14:57.233 --> 00:14:59.433
You idiot! I'm not showing you!

267
00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:02.633
I've got underwear and other stuff you shouldn't see in there!

268
00:15:02.633 --> 00:15:04.733
Like porn magazines?

269
00:15:04.733 --> 00:15:08.233
Yeah, really filthy hardcore stuff.

270
00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:13.133
Huh? There's a Teitan uniform poking out of your bag.

271
00:15:13.133 --> 00:15:15.533
What?

272
00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:17.033
Just kidding.

273
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:21.033
Hey, Kudo.

274
00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:22.733
Are you sure that snaggle-toothed girl

275
00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:25.433
doesn't know your true identity?

276
00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:27.633
Yeah, it's not good.

277
00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:32.533
What?

278
00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:35.933
What is it?

279
00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:38.033
Sorry, it's nothing.

280
00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.533
Bye.

281
00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:45.233
I'm so surprised.

282
00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:48.033
She's a girl after all.

283
00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:55.233
We just received word that Shinichi Kudo of class 2-B

284
00:15:55.233 --> 00:16:00.633
can't continue on the school trip due to urgent business.

285
00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:01.933
What?

286
00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:07.733
Also, he'd prefer to keep his involvement in the case secret,

287
00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:10.333
so he asks that you not mention it on social media!

288
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:13.033
Okay...

289
00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:17.533
I was going to ask him about the case on the way back.

290
00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:20.133
I guess we can ask Sera.

291
00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:23.333
I can't believe that wannabe detective actually left.

292
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:25.833
He never gave you a kiss.

293
00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:28.433
Don't say that!

294
00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:32.833
Also, Shinichi knew that I met with Okita.

295
00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:37.833
I sent Shinichi a picture of your clandestine meeting.

296
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:43.833
So, what were you two talking about?

297
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.933
We were talking after I delivered something to him.

298
00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:50.633
Detective Sato gave me this good luck charm.

299
00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:53.633
She said you dropped it during the kendo tournament.

300
00:16:54.633 --> 00:16:57.933
I've been looking for this. Thanks.

301
00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:00.133
Anyway, so...

302
00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:04.433
I left that charm on the desk at the detective agency,

303
00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:06.833
and my dad...

304
00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:09.133
What's this good luck charm?

305
00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:10.933
Is it Ran's?

306
00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:14.333
There's something inside.

307
00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:18.033
It's probably a picture of that detective kid or...

308
00:17:19.133 --> 00:17:22.033
Dad, what are you looking at?

309
00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:23.733
You looked at the picture?

310
00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:26.433
Yes, I wasn't thinking.

311
00:17:26.433 --> 00:17:29.133
Anyway...

312
00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:34.633
Is that girl in the photo your girlfriend?

313
00:17:34.633 --> 00:17:35.633
What?

314
00:17:35.633 --> 00:17:38.533
I got curious,

315
00:17:38.533 --> 00:17:41.233
so I thought I'd ask when I saw you.

316
00:17:41.233 --> 00:17:43.933
No, she's not my girlfriend.

317
00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:46.433
Not now, anyway.

318
00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:49.533
You like her, then?

319
00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:52.533
I think you'd make a good couple.

320
00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:56.233
She's my rival's sister.

321
00:17:56.233 --> 00:18:00.633
I can't tell her how I feel until I beat him.

322
00:18:00.633 --> 00:18:02.033
Really?

323
00:18:02.033 --> 00:18:05.533
Don't tell tits over there about this.

324
00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:06.633
Tits?

325
00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:09.933
I'll never hear the end of it if she finds out.

326
00:18:10.733 --> 00:18:13.433
That's all we talked about.

327
00:18:13.433 --> 00:18:14.733
Really?

328
00:18:14.733 --> 00:18:16.733
So you weren't cheating with his doppelganger

329
00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.833
because you were frustrated with your unreliable husband?

330
00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:21.633
It's not cheating!

331
00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:26.133
Thanks to that photo, you nearly got to kiss.

332
00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:27.933
You should be grateful.

333
00:18:27.933 --> 00:18:29.333
Listen here.

334
00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:31.533
Hey, Ran.

335
00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:35.033
How did it feel to kiss him?

336
00:18:35.033 --> 00:18:36.033
How did it feel?

337
00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:39.433
Aren't you asking the wrong person?

338
00:18:39.433 --> 00:18:43.133
I only kissed him on the cheek.

339
00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:44.833
It was only on the cheek,

340
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:48.433
but I kissed him like I was ready to leap from the Kiyomizu butai.

341
00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:51.733
But he...

342
00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:57.933
It's from Shinichi.

343
00:19:00.533 --> 00:19:02.333
Sorry, Ran.

344
00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:04.633
I wish I could've stayed with you a little longer,

345
00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:07.533
but it didn't work out that way.

346
00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:12.033
But I'm really glad I got to hear your response to my confession.

347
00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:13.433
Thanks.

348
00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:17.133
Jeez.

349
00:19:17.133 --> 00:19:20.333
I guess I'll forgive him.

350
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:21.733
Yeah.

351
00:19:21.733 --> 00:19:23.933
There seems to be a medicine

352
00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:27.533
that can restore your body, Mom.

353
00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.333
Then we'll do whatever it takes

354
00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:31.533
to find the inventor of this medicine,

355
00:19:31.533 --> 00:19:33.533
and obtain the medicine itself.

356
00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:37.233
Once I'm back in my old body, no more running around.

357
00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:41.533
We'll begin our counterattack.

358
00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:43.633
Don't mess this up, Masumi.

359
00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:55.533
Don't play with your phone while we're driving.

360
00:19:55.533 --> 00:19:56.833
It's dangerous.

361
00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:59.133
I'm just going to look.

362
00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:01.233
Thanks for the message.

363
00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:05.833
This means we're dating, right?

364
00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:08.533
Oh, man. I wish I could respond right now.

365
00:20:08.533 --> 00:20:10.833
Anyway, I really panicked.

366
00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:12.733
I had to stuff you into my bag

367
00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:16.733
while you were shrinking before my eyes.

368
00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:20.033
You should've told me before it happened.

369
00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:23.633
It wasn't so easy for me, either.

370
00:20:23.633 --> 00:20:24.833
Did something happen?

371
00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.733
If you weren't watching, don't worry about it.

372
00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:30.133
Yeah, I didn't see anything.

373
00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:32.233
I definitely didn't see you and that girl

374
00:20:32.233 --> 00:20:35.733
smooching at the Kiyomizu butai.

375
00:20:35.733 --> 00:20:37.833
So you were watching!

376
00:20:37.833 --> 00:20:39.533
Listen, it was in the spur of the moment...

377
00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:41.433
Gosh. The Kiyomizu butai was

378
00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:45.033
next on my list of breathtaking places to confess my feelings.

379
00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:47.833
And they even kissed?

380
00:20:49.733 --> 00:20:51.533
Gosh.

381
00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.633
Making things harder when he doesn't need to.

382
00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:19.733
It's all over the news here, too.

383
00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:21.333
Of course, it is.

384
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:25.133
The victims and the killer were famous.

385
00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:26.733
I'm surprised, though.

386
00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:31.733
The killer's motive was the suicide of the man Kyoko loved.

387
00:22:31.733 --> 00:22:32.833
Yeah.

388
00:22:32.833 --> 00:22:37.233
By the way, how did you know Michio Dekuri's name?

389
00:22:37.233 --> 00:22:38.933
From the movie poster.

390
00:22:38.933 --> 00:22:40.933
What?

391
00:22:40.933 --> 00:22:44.333
Dekuri's name wasn't on the poster.

392
00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:51.533
I thought there might be some reason

393
00:22:51.533 --> 00:22:54.333
your actress friend changed her name.

394
00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:59.533
If you cover the top and bottom of these unevenly spaced characters...

395
00:23:02.233 --> 00:23:03.233
You're right.

396
00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:06.133
"Michio Dekuri" -It says Michio Dekuri.

397
00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:11.833
Since the poster was made after the first screening,

398
00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:15.433
it's possible Dekuri wouldn't have killed himself

399
00:23:15.433 --> 00:23:19.733
and Agata wouldn't have killed anybody if they'd seen it.

400
00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:21.133
Yeah.

401
00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:27.733
The problem is how Shinichi, the boy who shouldn't exist,

402
00:23:27.733 --> 00:23:31.333
somehow solved this internationally newsworthy case.

403
00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:34.433
They're still only reporting that the case was solved

404
00:23:34.433 --> 00:23:37.033
by a group of high school detectives, though.

405
00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:38.733
It'll be fine.

406
00:23:38.733 --> 00:23:41.133
Shin's really thorough when it comes to that.

407
00:23:41.133 --> 00:23:43.133
I'm sure he asked them to keep it secret.

408
00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:47.633
"Mouri Detective Agency"

409
00:23:48.233 --> 00:23:50.133
I'm home!

410
00:23:50.133 --> 00:23:51.333
Great...

411
00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:56.633
Your daughter's back from her school trip.

412
00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:58.433
You should be welcoming her home.

413
00:24:00.233 --> 00:24:02.133
Is Conan upstairs?

414
00:24:05.533 --> 00:24:08.033
"No new messages" -He still hasn't responded.

415
00:24:08.033 --> 00:24:11.633
Did Shinichi read my message?

416
00:24:12.933 --> 00:24:15.333
"This means we're dating, right? From Ran"

417
00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:18.733
Hey. Are you listening, Kudo?

418
00:24:18.733 --> 00:24:21.733
When we get to Tokyo, you're buying me a steak.

419
00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:24.233
-Yeah. -Not a cheap one, either.

420
00:24:24.233 --> 00:24:28.233
One oozing with juices and, you know...

421
00:24:30.233 --> 00:24:32.133
A really, really good one.

422
00:24:32.133 --> 00:24:33.533
I know.

423
00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:36.233
I'll treat you. Don't worry about it.

424
00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:40.433
I shouldn't have offered to take you back to Tokyo.

425
00:24:40.433 --> 00:24:41.533
"Send"

426
00:24:47.933 --> 00:24:49.233
A message.

427
00:24:50.733 --> 00:24:52.033
From Shinichi?

428
00:24:58.133 --> 00:25:00.333
"From: Shinichi Kudo. Subject: Idiot. Of course, we're dating."

429
00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:10.233
"From: Shinichi Kudo. Subject: Idiot. Of course, we're dating."

430
00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:18.733
This means we're dating, right?

431
00:25:18.733 --> 00:25:22.633
Of course, we're dating.

432
00:25:26.933 --> 00:25:30.433
"Next Episode" -That's Saki Midorikawa.

433
00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:40.933
It's their fault for allowing themselves to be blackmailed.

434
00:25:40.933 --> 00:25:44.233
What were you looking at from your window?

435
00:25:44.233 --> 00:25:46.033
What? Who knows?

436
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:56.933
Next Conan, "The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 1)"

437
00:25:57.476 --> 00:25:59.976
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:01.976
"Photo Frame"

439
00:26:01.976 --> 00:26:03.776
-Are we dating? -What are you talking about?

440
00:26:03.776 --> 00:26:05.976
-What about us? -Of course, we are!
