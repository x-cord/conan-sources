1
00:00:00.582 --> 00:00:03.482
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.482
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:07.382
Today is show time for the troupe.

4
00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:09.582
The scenario and murder case are solved at once.

5
00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:11.182
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:13.282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.382
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:56.095
We went to watch play practice of a strolling players troupe,

9
00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.895
because the leader of the troupe, Tamanosuke Ito

10
00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:01.595
entered Ran's class as a new student.

11
00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:04.295
We encountered what looked to be a complicated problem backstage.

12
00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:10.795
And a murder was finally committed.

13
00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:15.995
At the time the murder was committed,

14
00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.195
everyone was on stage practicing.

15
00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.895
However, there is someone here,

16
00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:25.395
who without us in the audience noticing,

17
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.295
committed the murder.

18
00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:36.295
"The Strolling Players Troupe (Part 2)"

19
00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:38.895
We are in front of the inn

20
00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.695
where the strolling players troupe is staying,

21
00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:42.095
Mr. Tetsuo Chikaishi who was murdered last night

22
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.195
was a member of this group.

23
00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:47.995
The young troupe leader is presently being interrogated by the police...

24
00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:51.095
Gosh.

25
00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:53.595
Megumi, your brother's back!

26
00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:57.695
Tamanosuke!

27
00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:59.595
Are you all right?

28
00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:01.795
Yes, I'm all right.

29
00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:04.695
You haven't had any sleep since last night. How can you be okay?

30
00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:06.495
Tamanosuke.

31
00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:09.695
Well, why don't you get some rest?

32
00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.795
Make yourself at home.

33
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.695
I'm sorry to trouble you.

34
00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:17.095
We've been taking care of you ever since the days of your father.

35
00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:20.895
"Beika Inn"

36
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.095
Tamanosuke?

37
00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:58.395
Why did he come here at this time of night?

38
00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:00.895
I wonder why he came to the theater.

39
00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:06.795
Conan.

40
00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:08.995
Gosh, you scared me.

41
00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:11.695
You're worried about your brother, aren't you?

42
00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:13.195
Yes, sort of.

43
00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.195
What bring you here, Conan?

44
00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:18.795
I was a bit concerned about your brother, too.

45
00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.995
At any rate, you can leave the rest to me,

46
00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.095
and you'd better go back to the inn.

47
00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:26.195
Conan, are you trying to chase me away?

48
00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:27.595
No!

49
00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:30.295
I mean this is no time for a child to be outside.

50
00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:32.995
You're the same age as me, Conan!

51
00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:42.395
I wonder where Tamanosuke is.

52
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.795
What was that?

53
00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.095
It's towards the stage!

54
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:55.795
Tamanosuke.

55
00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.995
Get a hold of yourself, Tamanosuke!

56
00:04:57.995 --> 00:05:00.695
Gosh. The suspect still hasn't gone far.

57
00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:03.095
Megumi, get an ambulance! -Okay.

58
00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:06.995
Conan!

59
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:08.395
I'm all right.

60
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:12.595
Itoe!

61
00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:23.595
Tamanosuke Ito had been hit hard on the head

62
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:26.595
and is unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital.

63
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:31.395
The one who was dead at the bottom of the pit was

64
00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:35.595
Itoe Ogiwara, the accountant, as well as an actress in the troupe.

65
00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:38.595
The cause of her death was her fall into the pit.

66
00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:41.395
What's this?

67
00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:43.895
I will reveal your true identity.

68
00:05:43.895 --> 00:05:45.995
Wait on stage at 24:00.

69
00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:47.695
True identity?

70
00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.195
Inspector, she is holding something in her hand.

71
00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:58.095
It's a note.

72
00:05:58.095 --> 00:06:01.595
Inspector, the same thing is on the floor over here too.

73
00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:04.695
What is the meaning of this?

74
00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:06.895
Hey, Conan!

75
00:06:06.895 --> 00:06:09.995
Why are you here?

76
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.795
Thanks for coming, Mr. Mouri.

77
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:15.295
Conan is the one who found the corpse.

78
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.095
What?

79
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.595
There are a lot of small pieces of wood around the corpse.

80
00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:24.095
What's this?

81
00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:27.795
Hurry back home and go to bed, kid!

82
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:29.595
What time do you think it is?

83
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.895
"The next day" -What do you mean?

84
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:38.495
How dare you treat Tamanosuke who has gotten hurt, as a suspect!

85
00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:40.795
It can't be helped

86
00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:41.795
because his fingerprints were on the crowbar

87
00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:43.595
which was the murder weapon.

88
00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:46.195
How about the fingerprints of anybody else?

89
00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:49.095
Although the prints of few other members of the troupe were on it,

90
00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:53.095
Itoe's fingerprints weren't there.

91
00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:56.895
Which means that it can't be that Itoe fell into the pit

92
00:06:56.895 --> 00:07:01.395
after she attacked Tamanosuke and died.

93
00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:05.395
But Tamanosuke could never kill anyone!

94
00:07:05.395 --> 00:07:07.795
Ran, let's go visit him at the hospital.

95
00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:08.795
Okay.

96
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.995
Dad, look after Conan and the others, okay?

97
00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:14.195
Tamanosuke can't have any visitors

98
00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:15.995
because he's a suspect.

99
00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:18.195
But Megumi should be with him.

100
00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:19.995
All we're going to do is deliver flowers to him.

101
00:07:19.995 --> 00:07:21.295
Let's hurry and go.

102
00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:24.995
He still unconscious.

103
00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:27.595
It's just the thought that counts, so who cares!

104
00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:31.295
Gosh.

105
00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:34.495
Pops. If Tamanosuke is the suspect,

106
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:35.795
does it mean that he hit himself so hard

107
00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:38.895
that he knocked himself unconscious?

108
00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.795
No.

109
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:44.095
According to the doctor, his wound is not serious,

110
00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:48.195
but he's probably unconscious because of mental trauma.

111
00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:51.095
I see. If it's caused by mental trauma of him

112
00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:54.495
wanting to run from the reality of having committed a crime,

113
00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:57.595
he would still be considered the prime suspect.

114
00:07:57.595 --> 00:08:01.595
Even the note was analyzed for its handwriting

115
00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:03.895
and was found to be written by Tamanosuke.

116
00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:05.095
What?

117
00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:09.795
Besides, the same note was sent out to all the members of the troupe.

118
00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:12.595
Why, if his intention was to call Itoe out?

119
00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:14.495
How should I know?

120
00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:17.895
However, she had a lot of money saved up,

121
00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:21.895
and it seems she embezzled a great sum of money from the troupe.

122
00:08:21.895 --> 00:08:24.795
In other words, the leader of the troupe

123
00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.495
punished the playwrighter, Chikaishi, who wouldn't obey him,

124
00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:29.395
and Itoe who cheated the account.

125
00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:32.195
I wonder if he'd kill for something like that.

126
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:37.495
Wait, Conan! Bring me some beer.

127
00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:39.295
It's still broad daylight, you know.

128
00:08:39.295 --> 00:08:41.395
Let's not be so square.

129
00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:43.895
I'll tell you more about the case.

130
00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:45.895
Gosh.

131
00:08:45.895 --> 00:08:48.095
Here's something to munch on!

132
00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.595
Thank you.

133
00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:54.995
And, was Mr. Chikaishi's floppy found?

134
00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:06.895
It came out of Tamanosuke's room.

135
00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:08.395
The contents were all erased,

136
00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:10.395
and it was thrown in the wastebasket.

137
00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:12.995
Huh? The contents were erased?

138
00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:16.195
Maybe there was something inside that he didn't want anyone to see.

139
00:09:16.195 --> 00:09:17.395
But it would be found right away

140
00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:19.495
if it were thrown in a place like that.

141
00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:21.195
What should I care?

142
00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:23.695
Forget it, and go play outside already.

143
00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:26.595
He's always like this when he can't cope with the situation.

144
00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:28.995
Talk about useless.

145
00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:31.895
-Let's go. -Okay.

146
00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:33.795
Wait a minute. Get me another can!

147
00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:40.595
Conan. There are no pieces of chipped wood like there were down there.

148
00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:44.995
That's right! Maybe we can find wood.

149
00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:48.295
I get it!

150
00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:49.895
She may have been killed in a different place

151
00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:53.495
and then pushed into the pit.

152
00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.295
It's this color.

153
00:09:58.295 --> 00:10:00.595
They were pieces of plywood.

154
00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:02.295
-You mean this? -No! Idiot!

155
00:10:03.195 --> 00:10:05.195
Huh? What's with this?

156
00:10:05.195 --> 00:10:06.795
There's blood on it!

157
00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:10.095
It is about the same size as the pit.

158
00:10:10.095 --> 00:10:13.195
The color also resembles that of the stage.

159
00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.595
-It's trap! -Yeah.

160
00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:17.695
There are even slash marks on the palywood that is 3 millimeters thick

161
00:10:17.695 --> 00:10:20.495
so that it would break easily.

162
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.595
After she fell and died,

163
00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:25.095
she was carried over there and hidden, wasn't she?

164
00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:27.795
Did Tamanosuke hit himself after that?

165
00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:32.795
No. You and I followed him from the inn,

166
00:10:32.795 --> 00:10:35.295
so he had no time to set up such a trap.

167
00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:41.495
Oh, no!

168
00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:44.595
-We've got to hurry! -Hey! What is it?

169
00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:45.995
Tamanosuke is in danger!

170
00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:47.595
What?

171
00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.695
The killer is another person!

172
00:10:55.384 --> 00:10:57.684
Okay, I got it, Mr. Mouri.

173
00:10:57.684 --> 00:10:59.184
I'll get everything ready.

174
00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:01.384
Okay, I'll leave everything in your hands from here.

175
00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:02.984
Inspector.

176
00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:09.884
Yes, this is Conan.

177
00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:11.884
This is Ayumi.

178
00:11:11.884 --> 00:11:13.984
We've succeeded getting into the inn.

179
00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:16.784
All the people of the troupe are here.

180
00:11:16.784 --> 00:11:19.584
Mr. Tajima who is closest to the stairs

181
00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:22.484
is in his room watching TV.

182
00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:25.584
Yuri Shirai is straighten out her costumes.

183
00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:28.784
Mr. Muraki who has moved to the room of Mr. Chikaishi, who died,

184
00:11:28.784 --> 00:11:30.584
seems to be cleaning his room.

185
00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:32.784
That's it. Over.

186
00:11:32.784 --> 00:11:36.084
All right. You can all go home now.

187
00:11:36.084 --> 00:11:38.484
Hey, Conan! -Wait, Conan!

188
00:11:38.484 --> 00:11:40.384
He's done it again.

189
00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:46.984
"Haido City Hospital"

190
00:12:05.384 --> 00:12:07.284
That's it!

191
00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:10.084
Shoots!

192
00:12:10.084 --> 00:12:12.084
Don't let him get away!

193
00:12:12.084 --> 00:12:13.484
What?

194
00:12:21.884 --> 00:12:23.184
You're not getting away!

195
00:12:24.384 --> 00:12:25.784
Shoots!

196
00:12:27.584 --> 00:12:30.084
He is as nimble as the Edo Kid.

197
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.584
The Edo Kid was among the members of the troupe.

198
00:12:33.584 --> 00:12:35.484
Tamanosuke who realized his existence,

199
00:12:35.484 --> 00:12:37.884
tried to disclose his identity by creating a play about him.

200
00:12:37.884 --> 00:12:41.684
However, Mr. Chikaishi found out who it was before he did.

201
00:12:41.684 --> 00:12:45.784
Mr. Chikaishi probably blackmailed that person for this.

202
00:12:45.784 --> 00:12:47.484
That's why the man killed Mr. Chikaishi,

203
00:12:47.484 --> 00:12:49.784
took the floppy and fled.

204
00:12:49.784 --> 00:12:52.984
Tamanosuke who had confirmed the existence of the Edo Kid,

205
00:12:52.984 --> 00:12:56.484
was vexed that a murder had actually occurred.

206
00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:59.884
That's why he sent out the note.

207
00:13:00.684 --> 00:13:02.084
"Beika Inn"

208
00:13:08.384 --> 00:13:09.684
Yes.

209
00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:12.284
Inspector.

210
00:13:12.284 --> 00:13:14.684
I'm sorry to call on you so late, Mr. Tajima.

211
00:13:14.684 --> 00:13:17.284
Have you gone out anywhere tonight?

212
00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:19.584
No. -He was home.

213
00:13:19.584 --> 00:13:23.784
None of the members of the troupe went outside.

214
00:13:23.784 --> 00:13:25.184
Hey, you guys!

215
00:13:25.184 --> 00:13:26.984
Which means that Conan is here, too.

216
00:13:26.984 --> 00:13:29.484
Nope, I just got here.

217
00:13:29.484 --> 00:13:31.584
Conan!

218
00:13:31.584 --> 00:13:34.584
So, they're here after all.

219
00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:37.484
They're even testifying alibi.

220
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:41.984
I'm sure that he is the Edo Kid.

221
00:13:41.984 --> 00:13:43.784
But I don't have proof.

222
00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:46.184
Neat!

223
00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:48.584
This is quite exciting, isn't it?

224
00:13:48.584 --> 00:13:52.284
Why should only Conan be left behind? It's not fair!

225
00:13:52.284 --> 00:13:53.984
It can't be helped.

226
00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:56.284
His guardian is with him, after all.

227
00:13:56.284 --> 00:13:57.284
Right.

228
00:13:57.284 --> 00:14:00.384
And besides, who cares because we get to ride in a police car.

229
00:14:00.384 --> 00:14:03.584
Off we go. -I don't want to go home!

230
00:14:05.684 --> 00:14:08.084
Well, this sure is relaxing.

231
00:14:08.084 --> 00:14:09.484
A glass of beer is refreshing after a hard day's work,

232
00:14:09.484 --> 00:14:10.884
so have some.

233
00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:13.084
No, thank you, because I'm still on the job.

234
00:14:13.084 --> 00:14:15.684
Well, one glass can't do any harm.

235
00:14:15.684 --> 00:14:17.284
Right.

236
00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:20.584
Talk about taking it easy.

237
00:14:20.584 --> 00:14:23.084
When there is hardly no time left.

238
00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:24.684
No time left?

239
00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:26.084
I get it!

240
00:14:26.084 --> 00:14:27.984
Only two people had time

241
00:14:27.984 --> 00:14:30.284
when Mr. Chikaishi was murdered.

242
00:14:30.284 --> 00:14:34.684
But the person that matches the physique of the one

243
00:14:34.684 --> 00:14:36.184
who attacked Tamanosuke is him.

244
00:14:40.784 --> 00:14:43.684
Boy, it really stings.

245
00:14:47.584 --> 00:14:51.384
Please gather here everyone.

246
00:14:51.384 --> 00:14:52.684
What is it?

247
00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:56.084
I've figured out who the killer is.

248
00:14:56.084 --> 00:14:57.884
So, it's come?

249
00:14:57.884 --> 00:15:01.584
The person who killed Mr. Chikaishi and Itoe Ogiwara,

250
00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:05.084
as well as attack Tamanosuke twice

251
00:15:05.084 --> 00:15:07.284
is among us here.

252
00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:08.884
-What? -What did you say?

253
00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:10.084
That's nothing but baloney!

254
00:15:10.084 --> 00:15:13.384
Well, come now, let's at least lend him an ear.

255
00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:15.284
After all, thanks to Mr. Mouri,

256
00:15:15.284 --> 00:15:17.884
Tamanosuke's life was saved tonight.

257
00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:21.984
The killer who attacked Tamanosuke at the hospital

258
00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:25.884
was indeed as nimble as the Edo Kid.

259
00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:31.484
Yes. Everything began with the Edo Kid!

260
00:15:31.484 --> 00:15:33.784
As you all already know, the Edo Kid is a thief

261
00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:39.184
that is causing a commotion with his samurai-like nimble movements.

262
00:15:40.184 --> 00:15:43.684
For the past 6 months, I'm sure he's been making an appearance

263
00:15:43.684 --> 00:15:45.384
near the places that your troupe has journeyed.

264
00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:46.384
As to that,

265
00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:50.284
Yuri and I have already been interrogated and cleared.

266
00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:52.984
We had legitimate alibis!

267
00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:57.684
Are you two the only ones in this troupe that can do acrobatics?

268
00:15:57.684 --> 00:16:00.984
Yes, although Mr. Tajima is the one who taught me.

269
00:16:00.984 --> 00:16:02.984
Mr. Tajima hurt his back

270
00:16:02.984 --> 00:16:05.384
and hasn't done acrobatics for three years already.

271
00:16:05.384 --> 00:16:08.384
Now, Tamanosuke tried to force

272
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:12.084
the creation of the play of the Edo Kid this time.

273
00:16:12.084 --> 00:16:15.484
However, the script that Mr. Chikaishi had completed

274
00:16:15.484 --> 00:16:19.484
was not what Tamanosuke had desired.

275
00:16:19.484 --> 00:16:24.184
Why did Mr. Chikaishi change the story?

276
00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:28.684
That was because while he was researching on the Edo Kid,

277
00:16:28.684 --> 00:16:31.484
he realized the true identity of the Edo Kid.

278
00:16:31.484 --> 00:16:35.084
Mr. Chikaishi was probably blackmailing the Edo Kid

279
00:16:35.084 --> 00:16:37.984
in exchange for changing the contents of the script.

280
00:16:37.984 --> 00:16:41.684
Isn't that right, Edo Kid,

281
00:16:41.684 --> 00:16:43.484
rather, Mr. Kenzo Tajima?

282
00:16:45.384 --> 00:16:47.384
Mr. Tajima?

283
00:16:47.384 --> 00:16:50.984
Then, is it a lie that he hurt his back?

284
00:16:50.984 --> 00:16:54.584
It's probably true that he hurt it 3 years ago.

285
00:16:54.584 --> 00:16:59.684
However, I believe it was quite cured from about 6 months ago.

286
00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:00.884
Absurd!

287
00:17:00.884 --> 00:17:02.884
I'm not going to put up with listening to your story!

288
00:17:02.884 --> 00:17:03.884
I'm sorry,

289
00:17:03.884 --> 00:17:06.384
but could we have you stay seated for just a while longer?

290
00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:09.084
Mr. Tajima. Are you the killer?

291
00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:10.484
No!

292
00:17:10.484 --> 00:17:14.184
However, all circumstances point to the fact

293
00:17:14.184 --> 00:17:18.484
that you are the killer.

294
00:17:18.484 --> 00:17:19.784
What?

295
00:17:19.784 --> 00:17:23.384
That day, you three were the only ones

296
00:17:23.384 --> 00:17:25.784
who had a chance to kill Mr. Chikaishi.

297
00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:28.184
You were all acting out two roles

298
00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:30.884
to compensate for the lack of actors.

299
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:35.784
Yuri and you finished changing in the dressing room.

300
00:17:35.784 --> 00:17:37.884
Mr. Muraki had to change quickly

301
00:17:37.884 --> 00:17:40.684
so he did so while heading for the pit.

302
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:43.084
The pit of the Beika Theater is deep.

303
00:17:43.084 --> 00:17:49.784
Mr. Muraki, who had to change back into his previous costume,

304
00:17:49.784 --> 00:17:52.884
didn't have time to commit the crime.

305
00:17:52.884 --> 00:17:54.084
On the other hand,

306
00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:57.384
Mr. Chikaishi's room was beside the dressing room.

307
00:17:57.384 --> 00:17:59.184
Mr. Tajima and Yuri who had to pass

308
00:17:59.184 --> 00:18:01.984
in front of his room in order to change outfits,

309
00:18:01.984 --> 00:18:05.484
had time to kill Mr. Chikaishi.

310
00:18:06.584 --> 00:18:09.484
But Itoe died accidentally.

311
00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:10.984
It was only because she read the letters on the note

312
00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:13.184
as Itoe, her name.

313
00:18:13.184 --> 00:18:15.884
That note was meant for me.

314
00:18:15.884 --> 00:18:18.784
Why do you say so?

315
00:18:18.784 --> 00:18:20.484
That's the way the troupe leader

316
00:18:20.484 --> 00:18:25.584
had a habit of writing from Itaro to Edo Kid.

317
00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:26.884
That's right.

318
00:18:26.884 --> 00:18:30.884
It was not the Roman letters for the Japanese name "Itoe",

319
00:18:30.884 --> 00:18:35.584
but rather, it read "I To E" meaning from Itaro to the Edo Kid.

320
00:18:35.584 --> 00:18:39.584
Then, why did he have to pass it out to everyone?

321
00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:41.484
How would I know?

322
00:18:41.484 --> 00:18:44.584
Because I was enrage thinking that the troupe leader suspected me,

323
00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:46.584
that I went drinking.

324
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:52.484
What if that note was addressed to the real Edo Kid?

325
00:18:52.484 --> 00:18:54.284
Although Tamanosuke was certain

326
00:18:54.284 --> 00:18:57.684
that the Edo Kid had killed Mr. Chikaishi,

327
00:18:57.684 --> 00:19:01.384
but he wasn't sure who the Edo Kid actually was.

328
00:19:01.384 --> 00:19:04.284
That's why he sent the note out to everyone.

329
00:19:04.284 --> 00:19:06.284
However, Itoe who mistakenly thought

330
00:19:06.284 --> 00:19:10.184
it was addressed to her, went to the theater.

331
00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:12.884
She stepped on the trap that was set

332
00:19:12.884 --> 00:19:14.984
and fell to her death.

333
00:19:16.984 --> 00:19:21.384
Tamanosuke got hurt right after he entered the theater.

334
00:19:21.384 --> 00:19:28.484
In other words, Tamanosuke had no time to set the plywood up.

335
00:19:28.484 --> 00:19:29.584
Therefore,

336
00:19:29.584 --> 00:19:32.984
another person had to have been in the theater at that time.

337
00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:34.584
As evidence of that,

338
00:19:34.584 --> 00:19:38.484
another note was found by the pit.

339
00:19:38.484 --> 00:19:40.784
That's why you're saying I did it?

340
00:19:40.784 --> 00:19:42.984
Just because I had the time to kill Chikaishi,

341
00:19:42.984 --> 00:19:45.784
you can't tell whether I really killed him or not, can you?

342
00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.584
-Yuri had the time, too. -Hey.

343
00:19:47.584 --> 00:19:48.684
Mr. Tajima.

344
00:19:48.684 --> 00:19:50.884
The man who appeared at the hospital

345
00:19:50.884 --> 00:19:54.384
had a physique just like yours.

346
00:19:54.384 --> 00:19:56.484
Just because our physiques look alike, do I turn out to be the killer?

347
00:19:56.484 --> 00:19:58.584
If so, Mr. Muraki...

348
00:19:58.584 --> 00:19:59.984
Fine.

349
00:19:59.984 --> 00:20:03.284
Inspector, please check the fingerprints

350
00:20:03.284 --> 00:20:05.584
on Mr. Chikaishi's computer once again.

351
00:20:05.584 --> 00:20:06.784
What?

352
00:20:06.784 --> 00:20:08.884
We checked it when the first murder was committed

353
00:20:08.884 --> 00:20:12.184
but came up with nothing. Why now?

354
00:20:12.184 --> 00:20:16.984
The killer should've operated the computer after that.

355
00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:19.684
In order to verify the floppy

356
00:20:19.684 --> 00:20:22.084
that he stole out of Mr. Chikaishi's room,

357
00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:24.884
he probably touched it with his bare hands

358
00:20:24.884 --> 00:20:28.284
thinking it would never be checked again.

359
00:20:29.584 --> 00:20:31.184
Officer Takagi, get the Identification officer.

360
00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:35.184
-Yes, sir. -Okay. Enough.

361
00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:41.284
I did indeed kill Chikaishi and Itoe.

362
00:20:43.484 --> 00:20:46.984
I was relieved that Chikaishi who had figured out

363
00:20:46.984 --> 00:20:48.984
the true identity of the Edo Kid was dead.

364
00:20:48.984 --> 00:20:51.984
But I found that note in my pocket.

365
00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:55.784
I was instantly enraged,

366
00:20:55.784 --> 00:20:59.784
and without much thought, went to set up the trap.

367
00:20:59.784 --> 00:21:03.084
But after Itoe died, I snapped back to myself,

368
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:05.784
and was hiding the plywood,

369
00:21:05.784 --> 00:21:07.684
when I found Tamanosuke standing there.

370
00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:12.384
I actually tried to kill Tamanosuke.

371
00:21:12.384 --> 00:21:14.284
How could I...

372
00:21:14.284 --> 00:21:17.884
Mr. Tajima, it's all my fault.

373
00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:20.484
Just because I insisted on doing such a play.

374
00:21:20.484 --> 00:21:22.384
Troupe leader...

375
00:21:22.384 --> 00:21:24.084
I didn't intend to corner you

376
00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:26.784
by putting on the play of the Edo Kid.

377
00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:29.384
I just wanted you to repent your sins as soon as possible.

378
00:21:29.384 --> 00:21:31.184
I wanted you to turn yourself in.

379
00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:34.584
Troupe leader!

380
00:21:37.184 --> 00:21:38.884
I'm sorry!

381
00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:40.984
Please forgive me!

382
00:21:42.484 --> 00:21:45.584
It was stupid of me to go to a loan shark

383
00:21:45.584 --> 00:21:48.584
because I wanted money to have fun with!

384
00:21:48.584 --> 00:21:52.284
I'm sorry I threw dirt on the troupe's name!

385
00:23:33.084 --> 00:23:36.184
Later, the theater that was closed off was opened once again,

386
00:23:36.184 --> 00:23:40.484
and although the contents of the script were greatly altered,

387
00:23:40.484 --> 00:23:42.684
Tamanosuke, despite his wound,

388
00:23:42.684 --> 00:23:44.484
acted out his role on stage.

389
00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:50.184
We amateurs also

390
00:23:50.184 --> 00:23:52.684
go to make a special appearance on stage.

391
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:04.984
"Next Episode"

392
00:24:04.984 --> 00:24:06.784
It's a cash transport vehicle robbery!

393
00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:13.684
Don't go, Ms. Masami Hirota.

394
00:24:15.084 --> 00:24:17.084
If you go, you'll be killed.

395
00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:20.384
The men in black!

396
00:24:21.284 --> 00:24:24.284
I'll never forgive them!

397
00:24:24.284 --> 00:24:27.484
I'll... I'll nab them with my very hands!

398
00:24:28.284 --> 00:24:29.984
Next Conan,

399
00:24:29.984 --> 00:24:33.305
"Ten Gran Robbery of the Black Organization"

400
00:24:33.886 --> 00:24:36.486
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:36.486 --> 00:24:38.186
"Gin and Vodka"

402
00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:39.186
In the next episode, the men in black

403
00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:40.486
will finally make their appearance.

404
00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:42.786
I'm the "black" vacuum!
