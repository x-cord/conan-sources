1
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,840
Today, we're all going out to look at the stars.

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,340
We go out looking for a comet and discover a skeleton instead.

3
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,040
Solve the mystery of the scattered cigarettes!

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,940
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,325
Abnormality observation?

8
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,525
No, Genta.

9
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:04,025
Astronomical observation, astronomical observation.

10
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:07,925
Dr. Agasa, are we going to go watch stars from now?

11
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:12,725
Yeah, I found a nice pension in the mountains of Gunma.

12
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,125
But why are you going outside to watch stars

13
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,325
at a cold time like this?

14
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:19,625
It's good because it's cold.

15
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,425
The colder it is, the cleaner the air,

16
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,225
and the better it is to watch the stars.

17
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,325
Beside, tonight is the new moon.

18
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,525
In other words,

19
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,725
it's just the night to carry out an astronomical observation.

20
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:34,025
But, isn't it going to be boring just looking at the stars?

21
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,025
Come on, don't say that.

22
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,025
You can study the stars,

23
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,225
and we may by chance discover a new stars.

24
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,825
If we do, it may be named after us.

25
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,925
-What? Our names! -What? Our names!

26
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,225
A star...

27
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:50,425
We can name it after ourselves?

28
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:51,625
Yes, right.

29
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,925
Of course that's impossible

30
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,225
when it comes to asteroids in

31
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:58,025
which the orbit has to be observed repeatedly

32
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,825
and verified though.

33
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,625
But there is a possibility

34
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,625
if the star is a comet that only requires to be found.

35
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,625
How about calling it Beika Youth Detective Squad Comet?

36
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,725
Sounds nice.

37
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:11,425
-Nice, isn't it? -Nope.

38
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,325
The only star you can give a name of your choice to is to asteroids.

39
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:17,925
Comets are named after the surnames of their discoverers,

40
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,925
and moreover, the surnames of only the three people

41
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,025
who submitted their names the earliest can be given to the star.

42
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:26,025
Right, if a comet is found at the same time all over the world,

43
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:29,325
it's possible that your name will be mixed with a foreign name.

44
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:33,325
Three people, me, and...

45
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:37,325
For example, Kobayashi, Burger, Millon.

46
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:39,225
So, if we find a comet

47
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,225
and apply for it quickly,

48
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:45,925
it could be Yoshida Tsuburaya Haibara comet, right?

49
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,325
Yeah, right?

50
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:49,225
Yes, well...

51
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:53,325
Yoshida, Tsuburaya, Haibara?

52
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,825
How come my name's not there?

53
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:57,925
Include Conan's name too.

54
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:01,925
But it's only up to three names.

55
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,925
Conan, don't you?

56
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:06,525
Just what are you doing, Conan?

57
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,525
That man. He's the sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama,

58
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,925
the one that killed the professional baseball player Mr. Nose,

59
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,825
last time in Okinawa, right?

60
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,825
You were there at the time of the incident too, weren't you, Conan?

61
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,725
Yeah. I was bothered about something so...

62
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:21,725
"Sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama"

63
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,525
Bothered about what?

64
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,125
Well, it's not such a big deal but...

65
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,125
I was just wondering who he would call on his cell phone

66
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,325
during an interrogation session.

67
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,525
The police already would've contacted

68
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:38,825
the late Mr. Nose's parents and family so...

69
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,925
I think it's Mr. Motoyama's personal acquaintance.

70
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:46,625
Darn! I should've directly asked him who he called.

71
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,525
Maybe...

72
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:50,525
it was baseball player Kobayashi?

73
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:54,825
The one who entered the team at the same time as Mr. Motoyama.

74
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:58,825
They were on an off-season travel program together, all three of them,

75
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,725
and seemed to get along well together.

76
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:04,625
There's a possibility he informed him of the death of his best friend.

77
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,725
He seems to have succeeded his parents' Japanese inn

78
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,325
after he retired four years ago.

79
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:13,525
If I remember correctly, it was in a place called Kurayoshi in Tottori.

80
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:16,225
I saw it when it was introduced on TV once,

81
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,625
but it looked to be a nice inn.

82
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,125
I see.

83
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:25,025
It seems to have nothing to do with the men in black.

84
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,625
Kurayoshi.

85
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,225
Shinichi, don't tell me that you're...

86
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:45,525
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 1)"

87
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,825
Mr. Agasa, right? We've been waiting for you.

88
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,925
Please sign your name on our guest list.

89
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:52,725
All right.

90
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,625
Hiroshi Agasa.

91
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,325
Where is he?

92
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:57,425
"Etsuko Nonomiya (28), Guest"

93
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,725
He told you to come here too, didn't he?

94
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,625
Please tell me.

95
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,625
I want to apologize to him.

96
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,725
Where is Asao?

97
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:09,125
Asao, who is he?

98
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,425
Don't play dumb with me!

99
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:12,525
A man wearing the same ring that's a pair with this one!

100
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:13,925
Asao Kono!

101
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,225
You got an invitation card from him to, didn't you?

102
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,225
Ms. Nonomiya.

103
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,725
Invitation card?

104
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:25,725
Oh, no, you see, this is our first visit here.

105
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:27,925
Oh, really?

106
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,325
I'm sorry

107
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,825
Was that a surprise...

108
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,925
I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,525
Who is she?

110
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,425
"Amatsuchi (34), Pension Owner" -Her name is Etsuko Nonomiya

111
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:41,625
and she's an under classman of the university that I went to.

112
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,925
The man, Kono that she was referring to

113
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,825
was also an underclassman of my university.

114
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,825
They were engaged.

115
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,625
They used to come and stay over here a lot together in the past,

116
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,825
but after they had a big fight here a year ago,

117
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,825
he stopped coming all together.

118
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,825
Then last week, she seems to have received

119
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:02,325
an invitation card asking her to come here

120
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,925
and she's been waiting here for the past three days.

121
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,525
Since he hasn't shown up at all,

122
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,825
she's been that way drinking from day time.

123
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:13,225
But, why would she think that I, who she hasn't even met before

124
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,825
would also get an invitation card?

125
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,925
It's only natural.

126
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,925
"Mikami, Futagawa" -Because we who don't even know him all that well,

127
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:25,125
got an invitation card from that guy called Kono.

128
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:30,225
Well, we met him once over here a year ago that day.

129
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:32,725
Being that the subject in the invitation card was what it is,

130
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,225
we decided to at least come here.

131
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:37,725
May I see the invitation card?

132
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,725
Yeah, here.

133
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,925
Thank you.

134
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,125
As a result of my one year observation,

135
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,725
I have come up with a discovery that would shake the basis of astronomy.

136
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,925
I would like your opinion on the matter,

137
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:54,425
so please come to Pension Amatsuchi.

138
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:57,325
Of course I will foot the room charges.

139
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:58,925
If you can't come, it can't be helped,

140
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:03,525
but please make an effort to be there, Asao Kono.

141
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,125
Well, judging from the fact that he's not here,

142
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,625
despite two days already gone by it seems to have been a prank.

143
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,625
Shall we head back then, editor?

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,225
Editor?

145
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:18,625
Yeah, we're writing an astronomical magazine called "Space Sunday".

146
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,025
And, Mr. Mikami here is the editor.

147
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:25,925
He's no ordinary editor, either.

148
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,125
Oh, come on.

149
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,725
No big deal.

150
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:33,325
What do you mean by his no ordinary editor?

151
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:36,425
Well, he discovered a new comet,

152
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:40,225
and is a great man who a star is named after.

153
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,525
-You... -You discovered one?

154
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,925
Where did you find it?

155
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,625
Tell us where too.

156
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,125
Well, where that's not an easy question.

157
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,325
Over there? Over here?

158
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:53,325
Then I suggest you climb up the road in back

159
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,625
of the pension to the hill beyond.

160
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,525
It's a scenic viewpoint,

161
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,925
and just great for viewing stars

162
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,125
If you want, I'll lend you a telescope too.

163
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,625
For 5000 yen.

164
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,025
You're charging us for it.

165
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:12,125
-Be careful. -Okay!

166
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,525
All right. We'll find our star for sure!

167
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:16,825
Aye!

168
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,625
Hopeless amateurs.

169
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,625
Don't they know it's not that easy to find.

170
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,925
Right, editor?

171
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:27,725
No, who knows.

172
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:29,525
No matter how knowledgeable you are,

173
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:32,725
whether you can find a star or not depends on luck.

174
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:36,125
If you're lucky, you can find one.

175
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,425
Right, editor?

176
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,825
Won't you find him for me with your luck

177
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,925
of having found a star?

178
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,925
The guy who was obsessed by stars

179
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,625
and disappeared into the darkness of space.

180
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,525
My precious partner.

181
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,325
It sure is kind of far.

182
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,725
Come on, Dr. Agasa. Hang in there.

183
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,225
Hurry, hurry.

184
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,925
Isn't that the hill?

185
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,525
It's more a cliff than a hill.

186
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:14,725
You mean we're going to climb way up there?

187
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,825
Let's take a break.

188
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,725
Hey, let's climb up there before sundown.

189
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,125
Treat the aged with kindness.

190
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:26,325
You're usually telling me not to treat you like the aged.

191
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,525
Shall we rest about ten minutes then?

192
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,025
Agreed!

193
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:32,425
Darn, come on, man.

194
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:41,325
A rock, rock...

195
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,525
But, don't you think that invitation was sort of strange?

196
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,325
Would somebody write something like,

197
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,025
"If you can't come, it can't be helped"?

198
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,625
True.

199
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,325
There must've been some urgent reason

200
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,225
he wanted everyone to come here.

201
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,325
I found one!

202
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:10,325
What's up, Ayumi?

203
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,525
A skull?

204
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:15,225
No joke?

205
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:17,525
Why is a skull in a place like this?

206
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,125
There are some more scattered here.

207
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,325
What?

208
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:25,625
The lower jaw, the upper forelimb, and the thighbone.

209
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,325
Where's the body itself?

210
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,325
Over there?

211
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,125
What on earth?

212
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,925
The person probably fell from that cliff!

213
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,525
Yes, probably.

214
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,825
These are most likely

215
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,025
the bones of someone who fell quite some time ago.

216
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:46,125
The bones may have scattered due to animals, rain and the wind.

217
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,225
No.

218
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,325
This is a homicide case,

219
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,025
and an extremely heinous one too.

220
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,325
-What? -What?

221
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,425
Look, lime.

222
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:58,425
Lime has the quality of giving off heat after sucking up liquid.

223
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,925
When lime is scattered around the corpse and the nearby area,

224
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:04,325
it has the quality of giving off heat after being wet by rain

225
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:07,725
and as a result, the pace at which the body rots is quickened.

226
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:11,225
Therefore, the body skeletonizes in a very short time.

227
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,725
Maybe this skeleton is the Mr. Kono

228
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:16,825
that everybody was talking about back at the inn?

229
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:21,425
-No way. -But, he sent everybody the invitation card, didn't he?

230
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:24,825
-It could be the man called Kono. -What?

231
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:28,425
A ring and a cigarette case is under the rock.

232
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,625
The letters carved on the ring are,

233
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,425
ETSUKO to ASAO.

234
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:36,125
It's most likely that Mr. Kono left these here,

235
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,325
before the killer came back down here, after pushing him off the cliff.

236
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:43,425
He left these here most probably as evidence that he was killed.

237
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:46,625
But, maybe the killer left them here deliberately.

238
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,025
If so, I think he'd leave it on Mr. Kono's finger

239
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,325
after stripping him naked.

240
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:52,925
Why would a killer who attempts to hide the identity of his victim

241
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,925
deliberately hide something like that under a rock.

242
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,525
Will somebody lend me a handkerchief?

243
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,225
Okay.

244
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,925
-Yes. -Thank you.

245
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:04,025
Then, what's this cigarette box?

246
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:06,225
If my deduction is correct,

247
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,725
this is probably...

248
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,125
All there is in here are cigarettes.

249
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,525
Just as I thought.

250
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,625
Don't tell me that...

251
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,125
Yeah, this is what Mr. Kono left behind.

252
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,725
It's a dying message.

253
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:27,425
Dying message?

254
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,589
What about this cigarette?

255
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:38,089
Yeah, It's very likely that the man called Asao Kono left clues

256
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,389
about who the killer before he was killed.

257
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,689
But, isn't it just that two cigarettes out of six are torn?

258
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,089
Watch closely.

259
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,889
The two short cigarettes have filters on them, don't they?

260
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,689
It goes to show that the cigarettes were deliberately torn short

261
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,289
and put into the cigarette box.

262
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,389
And besides, look.

263
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,489
If you take a close look under the rock where the cigarette box was hidden,

264
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,089
it's pretty rotted. But the rest of the cigarettes

265
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,789
and the cigarettes that were torn apart then are disposed of, right?

266
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:10,489
In other words, Mr. Kono who left this behind

267
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:13,089
wants us to look at only the four long cigarettes

268
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,389
and two short cigarettes he put into the cigarette box.

269
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,589
We've got to go back and tell the people at the pension about this...

270
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,389
Hold it, Dr. Agasa.

271
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,489
It's not a good idea to tell the people of the pension about this.

272
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,589
Call the police first.

273
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,289
What? Why?

274
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:29,289
-Can't you tell? -What?

275
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:32,989
The guests at the pension right now are all people who have come

276
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,489
because they received invitation cards from Mr. Kono.

277
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:37,089
If these bones are really Mr. Kono's,

278
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,389
it's obvious that someone else sent them, right?

279
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,689
Moreover one year ago when Mr. Kono disappeared from the pension,

280
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:49,289
the people gathered now were also here back then.

281
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,089
If the reason these bones are scattered

282
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,089
are not because of rain, wind or animals,

283
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,189
but was scattered here deliberately by someone.

284
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,689
Yeah.

285
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,689
The one who sent out the invitation cards is probably hoping

286
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,589
that someone would find Mr. Kono's bones

287
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,389
and planning some evil scheme.

288
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:09,989
What is that evil scheme?

289
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,389
Beats me.

290
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:12,989
At any rate, call the police.

291
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:15,389
Hurry and contact them and have them come here.

292
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,589
What's up, Dr. Agasa?

293
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,189
Oh, well,

294
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:20,189
it seems that this area is outside the service area

295
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:22,789
and I can't call.

296
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,389
We've got no choice then,

297
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,689
but to go back to the pension

298
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:29,189
and call the police secretly.

299
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,689
The police?

300
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,389
What seems to be the matter?

301
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,789
Mr. Amatsuchi? What brings you here?

302
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:39,589
I recalled forgetting to put the heavy weight

303
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:40,689
of the telescope in the bag.

304
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,089
Oh, no.

305
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,089
-By the way, what seems to be the matter? -Oh, nothing...

306
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,189
-What the matter? -Nothing...

307
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,689
Did you find something strange?

308
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,089
Bones?

309
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,789
-Wait! -Oh no.

310
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,689
What? You found Asao's bones in the forest?

311
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,589
But, all you found were the bones, right?

312
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,089
Who knows if they're really Asao's or not?

313
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,089
Well, we found this beside the bones.

314
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:13,689
The pair ring carved with your initials that you gave him.

315
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:17,989
But it could be that the Asao Kono killed somebody

316
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:20,789
and deliberately put the ring there.

317
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,289
But the ring was found...

318
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,689
Did Mr. Kono have a cavity?

319
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,689
His upper tooth to the right, the 2nd one from the molar.

320
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,889
His upper molar?

321
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,989
If so, those bones aren't Asao!

322
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,789
He did have a cavity all right,

323
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:46,089
but it was his front lower tooth.

324
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,089
-No! -Then, it's him after all.

325
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,789
No doubt about it.

326
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,689
Hey, what do you mean?

327
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,089
I'm sorry to say that the dental treatment was done

328
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,289
on the lower jaw central incisor

329
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:00,289
In other words, it's exactly where you say it was.

330
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:03,689
He's lower front tooth had a cavity.

331
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,889
He deliberately said something else

332
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:10,789
so that you wouldn't just agree to what he said.

333
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,389
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,889
Oh no.

335
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:18,889
Which means that Asao is, Asao is...

336
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:24,989
At any rate, let's hurry and call the police.

337
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:28,389
But the phone doesn't seem working right.

338
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:33,189
This phone is only connected to an electric cord

339
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,489
and doesn't have a module cable.

340
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,889
What?

341
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:42,989
Strange, I used this phone just a while ago.

342
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,589
Do you have any other phones or a spare cable?

343
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,389
This is the only phone

344
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:50,089
and I haven't bought any spare cables.

345
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,789
Then, we can't call the police.

346
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,089
You have got to be kidding.

347
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,589
I'm going home by car.

348
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:57,889
But, editor...

349
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:02,889
I don't think that's possible either.

350
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:03,889
What?

351
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:05,889
I just went outside and checked,

352
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:10,289
but it seems all the cars that are parked here have flat tires.

353
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:14,189
Somebody probably loosened the air valve and deflated the tires.

354
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,589
So that no one could use the cars,

355
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,889
in order to keep everyone confined here.

356
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,989
That's absurd.

357
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:26,089
Hey, don't tell me this has something to do with the guy Kono?

358
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,189
-I'm sure it does. -For sure.

359
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,589
Because that was homi...

360
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,889
Come to think of it, when I found the bones,

361
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,289
you guys were watching, right?

362
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:38,489
You saw the four long cigarettes and two short cigarettes

363
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,689
on the handkerchief, didn't you?

364
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:43,889
Hey! Isn't that a dying message?

365
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,589
No, I wouldn't say it was...

366
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:51,989
No. That's no dying message.

367
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:54,089
I'm sure that...

368
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:01,989
Asao is just pretending to be dead to trouble me.

369
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,389
-He's so cute. -Anyway, let's all stay in our rooms tonight

370
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:05,689
and not go out.

371
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,689
I think it's best to wait until daybreak.

372
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,689
Yes.

373
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,289
There are a total of six cigarettes,

374
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,789
four long ones and two short ones.

375
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,889
If the name is Futagawa, there is one extra match

376
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,689
and if the name is Amatsuchi, one more match stick is needed.

377
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,289
As for Ms. Nonomiya and Mr. Mikami,

378
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,589
their characters cannot be displayed with six matches.

379
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,689
What if you write it in katakana?

380
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,189
That's impossible too.

381
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,389
Futagawa would require 14 match sticks

382
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,489
and Amatsuchi 12, eight for Nonomiya

383
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:57,989
and for Mikami, nine matches would be necessary.

384
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,189
What if you try their initials?

385
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:04,689
Like for Haibara Ai, it would be "HA", that's exactly six matches.

386
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,789
Then, are you saying that you're the killer?

387
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,389
Like I said, it's just an example.

388
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:16,389
Oh, an example.

389
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,289
Come to think of it Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko, TM

390
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,289
and Yoshida Ayumi, YA are also six matches.

391
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,789
True.

392
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,789
Kojima Genta is...

393
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:31,789
How romantic to think that only the three of us require six match sticks.

394
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:35,589
I'm Agasa Hiroshi, AH and can be displayed with six matches too.

395
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,389
Wow, what a coincidence?

396
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:39,589
Hey.

397
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:43,589
You just may be right about it being initials.

398
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,589
What? The killer is Mr. Futagawa?

399
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:51,689
Yeah. If those cigarettes really stand for initials...

400
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,989
Mr. Amatsuchi Ryoji is AR,

401
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,489
Nonomiya Etsuko is NE,

402
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,189
Mikami Heihachi is MH.

403
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:04,189
Only Futagawa Hajime, FH can be created with six matches, right?

404
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:07,589
But, I wonder if it's a good idea to go see Mr. Futagawa in person.

405
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:10,989
Don't worry, I'm just going to throw him a catch question.

406
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,789
Mr. Futagawa's not here

407
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,489
The cigarette filter is still damp.

408
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,789
Not too long has passed yet since he left the room.

409
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,889
Somebody's walking outside.

410
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:31,089
That's Ms. Nonomiya?

411
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,389
Oh no, not only Mr, Futagawa

412
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,289
but Mr. Mikami and Mr. Amatsuchi are nowhere in sight either.

413
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,989
Darn. I told them not to go outside.

414
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:42,489
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and I will go get Ms. Nonomiya back.

415
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:45,589
Dr. Agasa, Ai and Genta, go and look for the other three.

416
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:47,589
Okay.

417
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:48,989
Ms. Nonomiya!

418
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:50,489
Where are you?

419
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:52,789
Ms. Nonomiya!

420
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:58,189
That's the road that leads to the place we found the skeleton, right?

421
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:00,589
Then, maybe she went there to confirm

422
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:02,589
if the bones were really Mr. Kono's.

423
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:03,989
Oh no.

424
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:06,689
What was that sound?

425
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,489
Mr. Futagawa?

426
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:14,089
No good. His neck is broken.

427
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,089
-What? -What?

428
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,389
He's not breathing anymore.

429
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:19,589
He's holding something.

430
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,989
A cigarette case?

431
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,589
The same dying message again?

432
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,689
No, this time...

433
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,789
there's one more.

434
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:03,689
"Next Episode" -Hey, easy on the stuff and don't mess things up too much.

435
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:07,189
Oh, you brought a telescope with you, sir?

436
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:08,789
How long are you going to keep searching?

437
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,689
The only thing that could serve as a murder weapon

438
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,389
would be this umbrella.

439
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,989
Okay, the only one left is Mr. Amatsuchi,

440
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,489
it's your turn.

441
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,189
I saw him checking the guest list closely.

442
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:22,189
Over and over again.

443
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,089
Wrong.

444
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,589
Next Conan,

445
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,589
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 2)"

446
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,816
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,716
"Initial"

448
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:35,916
Next week, the case will be solved.

449
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,916
The highlight is my super acting skills.
