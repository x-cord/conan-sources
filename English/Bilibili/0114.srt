1
00:00:01.278 --> 00:00:04.738
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.398
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:10.108
Today's stage is a white sandy beach!
Couples come in varieties!

4
00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:12.068
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:13.858
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:16.318
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.971
"The Scuba Diving Murder Case (Part 1)."

8
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.071
Have you thought about it?

9
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:08.431
Yeah. Saturday and Sunday.

10
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.911
Eh?! You will?! Really?! Thank you!

11
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:15.741
What're you doing this late at night?

12
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:18.311
Conan-kun!

13
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:21.371
Nothing! Just talking to a friend!

14
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.431
Alright, then! Goodnight!

15
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:33.431
Goodnight, Conan-kun!

16
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.431
What's with her?

17
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.521
Swimming in Izu?

18
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:48.061
Yeah! This Saturday and Sunday!
You didn't have any plans!

19
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:52.111
It's a really beautiful hotel and
its private beach is the greatest!

20
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.681
I bet it costs the greatest, too.

21
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:59.581
It's my first break in a while,
so I'd rather drink and sleep here.

22
00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:03.541
I'm pretty sure you drink and
sleep even when you are working.

23
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.141
But I already promised...

24
00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:07.431
Promised?

25
00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:08.391
With who?

26
00:03:08.391 --> 00:03:11.011
Oh, no one! Nothing to do with you!

27
00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:13.851
You want to come swimming
too, right, Conan-kun?!

28
00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:15.221
Right?!

29
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:17.351
Y-Yeah...

30
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:21.521
Forget it! Don't teach him
to be lazy at such a young age!

31
00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:28.061
I hear the hotel's beach is
filled with sexy women in swimsuits...

32
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.981
It's brimming with college
girls and female office workers!

33
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.451
What's she saying? Ran is
usually against that kind of thing...

34
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:42.661
Well, I have been working a lot lately.
Recuperation might be nice.

35
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:45.471
Hurray! Thanks, Dad!

36
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:47.631
No, it's nothing...

37
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:54.601
Hey, now! The old guy's the same
as ever, but what's up with Ran?!

38
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.971
Wow! The ocean's so pretty!

39
00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:06.811
The sexy sea is calling for me!

40
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:15.151
Queen Hotel, Izu

41
00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:19.121
This hotel definitely
lives up to its reputation.

42
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.831
What is it?
Are you looking for someone?

43
00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:27.521
Eh? Not at all!

44
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.291
Dad! Let's hurry and check in!

45
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.511
Oh, right. We should hurry.

46
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.381
You've reserved two rooms.

47
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:38.931
Yes.

48
00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:46.101
Huh? We don't need separate rooms.
Wouldn't a suite be cheaper?

49
00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:49.931
We'd only get in the way later on.

50
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.221
Oh, nothing! Let's just change
and hurry to the beach!

51
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.071
Yeah! Sexy girls are waiting!

52
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.801
Too strange. Something is going on.

53
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.081
So much sun!

54
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:15.771
Tadah! Here it is, Dad!
The swimsuit I bought yesterday!

55
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:20.261
Shh! Not so loud! I don't want
anyone to know I have annoyances!

56
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:22.721
What's that supposed to mean?

57
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:26.271
Well, uhh, it means...

58
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.311
Oh! Hey there, nice-bodied girl!

59
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:33.691
I can rub that oil on you if you'd like!

60
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:42.571
E-Eri? Why are you here?

61
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.541
Why are you here?

62
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.021
Wow! What a wonderful coincidence!

63
00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:51.501
You're true lovebirds!
It's like you make a perfect pair!

64
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:54.291
Ran, don't tell me...

65
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:55.681
...you plotted this.

66
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:57.461
Eh? Plotted what?

67
00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:00.431
So that's why you got separate rooms?!

68
00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:02.721
Eh? What do you mean?!

69
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.681
Geez... it's so obvious.

70
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.141
Come on, stop being angry, you two!

71
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.071
I apologize for secretly
bringing you together!

72
00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:24.451
Let's enjoy the Izu ocean more!
Okay? Okay? Okay?!

73
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.911
I was enjoying it.

74
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:35.631
Until a hag showed up, wearing
a swimsuit that didn't match her age.

75
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:42.841
Oh, and who was drooling
and howling at the sight of that hag?

76
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:47.181
Come on, you two...

77
00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:51.641
I gotta use the bathroom.

78
00:06:52.021 --> 00:06:54.401
Oh! Dad! Wait!

79
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:58.431
He's just embarrassed!
He hasn't seen you in a while!

80
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.821
I wonder.

81
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:05.531
To me, he looks like a petty-minded
man who can't ever concede.

82
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:11.961
Huh? You're not wearing
your wedding ring? You usually do...

83
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:19.431
Oh, it's on purpose.
I was testing him to see if he'd notice.

84
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:23.171
I thought there would
still be hope if he noticed.

85
00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:25.561
I guess it was pointless.

86
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:27.971
But that's...

87
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:30.311
My life is a huge failure.

88
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:34.641
Maybe I should quit with this
separation and start my life over.

89
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.351
Mom!

90
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:39.941
Don't wind up like that man, Conan-kun.

91
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:42.271
O-Okay!

92
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:45.931
I don't think I would ever want to...

93
00:07:49.771 --> 00:07:53.121
What could've happened?
Dad's been gone a long time.

94
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.581
He's probably back
at the beach, hitting on girls.

95
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:00.271
That's silly!

96
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:07.511
I'm so lucky to meet the great
Mori Kogoro-san in a place like this!

97
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:14.931
It's an honor for me, too!
To think I have such charming female fans!

98
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:18.061
What did I tell you?

99
00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:19.611
It's just a coincidence!

100
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.191
He probably just met them after
he used the bathroom! And then--!

101
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:27.161
Look at his legs, then.

102
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:31.241
They were clean before,
but now there's sand up to his knees.

103
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:38.211
I can easily imagine him
kneeling in the sand to rub oil on them.

104
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:43.351
I wonder if he brought
them here to show off to me.

105
00:08:43.351 --> 00:08:45.101
What a pathetic man.

106
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:46.551
You can't be serious...

107
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.681
Don't tell me he actually--!

108
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:52.141
Maybe I should start
a fan club or something!

109
00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:54.851
Never mind.

110
00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:57.101
Hey! Dad!

111
00:08:57.101 --> 00:09:00.771
Oh, Ran! These girls
say they're fans of mine!

112
00:09:00.771 --> 00:09:03.221
Let me introduce the family.

113
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:06.991
Urgh! Whatever!

114
00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:11.201
I'll start with these two first!
I met them on the beach just now!

115
00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:11.561
Toda Kiwako, College Student

116
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:13.931
This is Toda Kiwako-san, a college student.
Toda Kiwako, College Student

117
00:09:13.931 --> 00:09:14.821
Hello!
Toda Kiwako, College Student

118
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:15.181
Hello!

119
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:15.951
And then Matsuzaki Harumi-san,

120
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:16.561
Matsuzaki Harumi, College Student
And then Matsuzaki Harumi-san,

121
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:18.721
also a college student.
Matsuzaki Harumi, College Student

122
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.171
Nice to meet you!
Matsuzaki Harumi, College Student

123
00:09:20.171 --> 00:09:23.881
Oh! How cute! Is this your son?

124
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:27.971
No, that's Conan, an acquaintance's
kid who we're looking after.

125
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:31.471
Behind him is my daughter, Ran.

126
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:32.681
Hi.

127
00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:35.891
And in the back is...

128
00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.021
...his ex-wife, Eri.

129
00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:40.731
Eh? You're divorced?

130
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.441
No, she's just joking!

131
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:47.391
No, not necessarily...

132
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:49.451
Knock that off, old man!

133
00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:53.661
A guy your age shouldn't be messin' with my friends!
Kawazu Kunio, College Student

134
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:57.471
Hey! Masahiko!
You say somethin', too!

135
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:01.121
Your dear fiancÃ©e and sister
are bein' fooled, you know!

136
00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:04.681
Matsuzaki Masahiko, College Student
Now, now. You don't have to be so angry.

137
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:05.351
Besides, he seems to be a celebrity,
so you can't blame them.
Matsuzaki Masahiko, College Student

138
00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:08.461
Besides, he seems to be a celebrity,
so you can't blame them.

139
00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:10.221
Celebrity?

140
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:15.431
He's Mori Kogoro-san,
the famous "Sleeping Kogoro" detective!

141
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:20.101
I knew it! I knew I recognized
you from somewhere!

142
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:24.561
I'm that well-known?
I'm at a loss for words!

143
00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:30.531
My face gets in papers and on
TV all over, so I can't do anything bad.

144
00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:32.811
Say, have you had lunch yet?

145
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:34.061
No.

146
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:37.241
Then let's all have lunch together!

147
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:42.461
There's a small restaurant
behind this hotel. What do you say?

148
00:10:42.461 --> 00:10:44.181
Oh! Sounds good!

149
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.171
Let's go!

150
00:10:55.431 --> 00:11:01.231
Oh, you're all part of
your school's scuba diving club?

151
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:05.441
Yes, we even had a dive
this morning before lunch!

152
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:11.611
So this is your last time diving
single before the wedding next week?

153
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:15.821
No, we'll be diving tomorrow too,
so this isn't the last time.

154
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:21.541
But it was tough getting my
brother into this club! He can't swim!

155
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:23.101
He can't swim?

156
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:24.021
Right.

157
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:28.751
You don't need to swim to dive.
You got an oxygen tank, after all.

158
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:33.181
Even as a boy, Masahiko-san
was never able to swim.

159
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:34.591
Quit it...

160
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:40.771
Eh?! Does that mean
you two are childhood friends?!

161
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:42.771
Oh, I suppose...

162
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:45.851
Wow! Childhood friends getting married!

163
00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:48.691
It's almost like my mom and dad!

164
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:51.651
Right?! Right?! Right?!

165
00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:55.061
"Childhood friends," huh...

166
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:59.121
So many a couple have been
heartbroken by that sweet phrase...

167
00:11:59.121 --> 00:12:04.081
Embracing familiar friend and
fantasy is the height of foolishness.

168
00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:07.291
Well, I don't think you'll need it,

169
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:13.011
but if you ever distrust your wife,
just call the Mori Detective Agency.

170
00:12:13.011 --> 00:12:17.101
If you want to receive major
compensation from your husband

171
00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:19.801
when you divorce,
just call the Kisaki Law Office.

172
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:22.771
Call anytime!

173
00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:24.561
Brrr...

174
00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:27.811
How did it turn out this way?

175
00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:32.651
Come to think of it,
where's your other childhood friend?

176
00:12:33.061 --> 00:12:38.871
Oh, Hiroshi said he was gonna
do some snorkeling after the dive.

177
00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:40.741
Snore-killing?

178
00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:43.701
Diving without an air tank.

179
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:46.661
He's diving without even eating?

180
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:52.131
Yes, he is kind of strange;
he likes the ocean more than women!

181
00:12:52.131 --> 00:12:55.051
Wonder if he plans to marry a shark!

182
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:57.801
That's mean!

183
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:03.681
Hey, Harumi.

184
00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:08.021
Sorry to ask, but could you get
a fresh beach towel from our room?

185
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:08.911
Eh?

186
00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:12.941
Hey, Kiwako.
Don't tell me you're going to...

187
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:16.901
Yep! I suddenly want
to take a dip in the ocean, too!

188
00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:19.391
Will you be alright drunk?

189
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:22.871
You don't have to do it today.
Can't you go tomorrow?

190
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:26.971
I'll be fine! I haven't
had that much to drink!

191
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:29.331
It'll just be some light snorkeling!

192
00:13:29.331 --> 00:13:31.791
Should I join you, then?

193
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:34.871
That's okay! I want to dive by myself!

194
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.721
Later, Harumi! Don't forget!

195
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.911
Kiwako...

196
00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:57.811
The ocean seems to be getting rough.

197
00:13:57.811 --> 00:13:59.741
I wonder if Kiwako is okay...

198
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:02.071
Oh, you're all here!

199
00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:05.031
Hiroshi! You're with Kawazu?

200
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:07.471
We ran into each other in the john.

201
00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:08.041
Ito Hiroshi, College Student
We ran into each other in the john.

202
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:10.781
Today's diving spot was really great!
Ito Hiroshi, College Student

203
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:12.001
Ito Hiroshi, College Student

204
00:14:12.891 --> 00:14:15.391
Huh? Where's your bride?

205
00:14:15.391 --> 00:14:17.561
Still in the ocean.

206
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:19.471
Huh? You didn't see her?

207
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:22.181
No, not at all.

208
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.431
Look! There she is! She's waving to us!

209
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.391
Kiwako!

210
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.811
Something doesn't seem right!

211
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:39.111
Wait!

212
00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.241
She's drowning!

213
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:44.101
K-Kiwako!

214
00:14:54.385 --> 00:14:55.715
Wait!

215
00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:56.915
She's drowning!

216
00:14:58.715 --> 00:15:00.455
K-Kiwako!

217
00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:01.915
Kiwako!

218
00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:02.675
Brother!

219
00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:05.505
Wait! Masahiko!

220
00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:10.305
Kiwako!

221
00:15:15.805 --> 00:15:19.605
You idiot! Get back! You can't swim!

222
00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:25.825
You're alright now!

223
00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:27.155
Kiwako! Stay calm!

224
00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:32.155
Where's Masahiko-san?

225
00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:36.125
Yeah, he's here.
He came to save you.

226
00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:39.595
Oh... That's a relief...

227
00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.765
W-What was that?

228
00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:47.005
T-That's--!

229
00:15:47.345 --> 00:15:50.965
Okay, stud! You can carry her now!

230
00:15:50.965 --> 00:15:55.935
Don't worry, Masahiko!
She probably just had a leg cramp!

231
00:15:57.175 --> 00:15:58.765
Sea snake!

232
00:15:58.765 --> 00:16:00.725
D-Don't tell me she--!

233
00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:03.565
Sheesh. We told you not to go out there.

234
00:16:03.925 --> 00:16:08.275
Now, now. You can argue
all you want after you're married.

235
00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:11.985
Hey, Kiwako. Are you listening?

236
00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:16.575
K-Kiwako!

237
00:16:21.135 --> 00:16:22.585
K-Kiwako!

238
00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:24.795
What's going on?! What happened?!

239
00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:27.755
Hey! Say something! Hey!

240
00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.215
Don't move her!

241
00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:33.635
She might've been bitten by a sea snake!

242
00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:35.425
A sea snake?!

243
00:16:35.965 --> 00:16:38.685
There was a sea snake right by us earlier!

244
00:16:38.685 --> 00:16:42.355
I-If so, then there should
be fang marks somewhere!

245
00:16:43.675 --> 00:16:46.345
H-Hand... Left hand...

246
00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:47.565
Her left hand!

247
00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:50.025
There they are! Bite marks!

248
00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:55.115
Then she was bitten by a sea snake?!

249
00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:58.345
For now, we have to tie off the
affected area and suck out the poison!

250
00:16:58.345 --> 00:17:00.575
Does anyone have anything
to use as a tourniquet?!

251
00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:02.445
Will a handkerchief do?!

252
00:17:02.445 --> 00:17:02.995
Alright!

253
00:17:10.545 --> 00:17:14.215
But how did you know
it was a sea snake, little--?

254
00:17:14.215 --> 00:17:15.675
Hey! Little boy!

255
00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.345
What's with him?

256
00:17:17.345 --> 00:17:21.645
I saw the sea snake!
It was about forty centimeters long!

257
00:17:22.135 --> 00:17:23.045
What's wrong?!

258
00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:24.475
Call an ambulance, quick!

259
00:17:24.475 --> 00:17:28.695
What? I thought you
saved her from drowning?

260
00:17:28.695 --> 00:17:31.525
A sea snake bit Kiwako-san
on the back of her hand!

261
00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:33.175
A sea snake?!

262
00:17:33.175 --> 00:17:35.235
Whoa! Those are really poisonous!

263
00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:38.205
So hurry and call an ambulance!

264
00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:44.995
H-Hey!

265
00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:49.015
Why'd he just run off with iced tea?

266
00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:50.465
Tannin.

267
00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:55.465
Washing the wound with the
tannin in tea to neutralize the poison

268
00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:59.135
is the best emergency
measure for sea snake bites.

269
00:17:59.135 --> 00:18:02.345
Of course, the person
who sucks out the poison

270
00:18:02.345 --> 00:18:05.105
will need to wash
their mouth with tea, too.

271
00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:08.565
But how does that runt know that?

272
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:12.305
Oh? He's a pretty sharp boy.

273
00:18:12.305 --> 00:18:17.285
He's much more useful than we are,
as we twiddle our thumbs here.

274
00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:20.925
Though shouldn't you ask why
a certain former police detective

275
00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:23.495
didn't know about it instead?

276
00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:24.955
Hmm?

277
00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:27.885
In any case, I'll call the ambulance.

278
00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:32.885
You go ask the cook for
some coarse tea full of tannin.

279
00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:35.845
I'm counting on you, Great Detective.

280
00:18:42.805 --> 00:18:45.105
Kiwako... Hang in there!

281
00:18:45.635 --> 00:18:49.135
I'm her fiancÃ©. Can I come with her?

282
00:18:49.135 --> 00:18:50.095
Of course.

283
00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:55.345
Who saw the sea snake?!

284
00:18:55.345 --> 00:18:56.715
I did!

285
00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:58.405
Do you know what type it was?!

286
00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.515
The type?

287
00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:04.115
There's a picture book in the hotel office...

288
00:19:04.115 --> 00:19:07.585
Then contact the hospital as
soon as you know what kind it was!

289
00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:08.845
Right!

290
00:19:22.385 --> 00:19:24.095
Office

291
00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:34.275
This is it! It was this sea snake!

292
00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:35.715
A black-banded sea krait!

293
00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:37.615
What's it doing in Izu?

294
00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:41.585
They sometimes show up
on the Kuroshio Current.

295
00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:43.715
There's just a prickly feeling
and then no swelling after that,

296
00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:43.845
so some fishermen have died
without ever noticing them.
There's just a prickly feeling
and then no swelling after that,

297
00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:47.325
so some fishermen have died
without ever noticing them.

298
00:19:47.325 --> 00:19:51.915
You let people swim in the ocean
with such dangerous sea snakes?!

299
00:19:51.915 --> 00:19:52.945
N-No!

300
00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:56.365
The fishermen just happened to be bitten

301
00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:59.845
when sticking their hands in fish
nets that had also caught the snakes!

302
00:19:59.845 --> 00:20:02.945
Even so, we're talking
about sea snakes here!

303
00:20:02.945 --> 00:20:05.305
Surely some might
suddenly attack people!

304
00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:10.945
These snakes are docile and
never attack people on their own.

305
00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:13.695
In the twenty-two years since
this hotel was founded,

306
00:20:13.695 --> 00:20:17.275
not a single visitor
has been bitten by one.

307
00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:23.245
Umm, do any of these
sea snakes have wings?

308
00:20:23.565 --> 00:20:26.705
Wings? No such variety exists.

309
00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:28.985
That's strange.

310
00:20:28.985 --> 00:20:34.715
I recall seeing small wings
behind the head of the one I saw...

311
00:20:34.715 --> 00:20:37.925
Seaweed or something
must've caught onto it.

312
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:39.885
I guess...

313
00:20:39.885 --> 00:20:45.805
But only my daughter could remember
so much from one quick look!

314
00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:48.945
I only remember well
because it was so shocking!

315
00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:51.515
Yes, you have a wonderful
power of observation!

316
00:20:51.865 --> 00:20:53.815
Unlike a certain someone else

317
00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:58.235
who didn't even notice
his wife's missing wedding ring.

318
00:20:58.235 --> 00:21:01.485
Huh? What about your ring now?

319
00:21:01.485 --> 00:21:02.945
Nothing.

320
00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:11.525
I can only imagine she playfully
stuck her hand in the snake's nest.

321
00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:12.695
Yeah.

322
00:21:12.695 --> 00:21:14.915
In any case, I'll go contact the hospital!

323
00:21:21.695 --> 00:21:23.135
No, that's not it!

324
00:21:24.615 --> 00:21:28.005
Those fang marks were no accident!

325
00:21:29.695 --> 00:21:35.815
Someone held the snake and
forced it to bite her hand in the water!

326
00:21:36.115 --> 00:21:39.565
In which case, was it one of
the people who rushed to help her?!

327
00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:42.815
No, everyone was empty-handed then,

328
00:21:43.365 --> 00:21:45.655
and they rushed there because
Kiwako-san was drowning!

329
00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:49.445
There's no one crazy enough
to have a sea snake ready

330
00:21:49.445 --> 00:21:52.375
when they don't know if
someone will drown or not!

331
00:21:53.315 --> 00:22:00.275
It'd be more natural to think she
started to drown after she was bitten.

332
00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:03.875
Which means only
Hiroshi-san could've done it!

333
00:22:05.155 --> 00:22:09.115
He was in the ocean
just before she drowned,

334
00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:11.185
so he could've had it bite her!

335
00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:16.895
But his emergency treatment
afterward was perfect.

336
00:22:17.655 --> 00:22:22.905
Would someone go that far
to help someone they're trying to kill?

337
00:22:24.115 --> 00:22:30.025
In any event, one of those four
people was responsible for this!

338
00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.995
You liked Kiwako-san?

339
00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:09.045
I guess it was love at first sight.

340
00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:13.375
Can you help me?
I can't find Kiwako's insurance card!

341
00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:16.545
Inside the towel at the bottom of the bag.

342
00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:27.685
This was no accident!
And you're the one behind it!

343
00:24:28.435 --> 00:24:29.625
On the next Conan--
