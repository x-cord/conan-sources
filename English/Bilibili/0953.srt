1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
"Cafe Poirot" -Pops brought me and Ran,

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.070
along with Amuro,

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.470
to meet a client who received a threatening letter

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.970
at a Black Bunny Club called Black Bunny Restaurant

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.270
The client was a wealthy man named Gunzo Morooka.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.670
He brought his butler, Atsufumi Fukamachi, with him.

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.470
The threatening letter stated,

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.570
"If you want to live,"

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.170
"stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant."

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.970
Well? Seen anyone suspicious?

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.570
Not in particular.

12
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.070
What about you, Amuro?

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.370
I don't detect any murderous intentions.

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.370
"Yuri Asakura (25), Employee"

15
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.770
-What? -What?

16
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.670
You found arsenic in Ms. Yuri's drink?

17
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.570
-Yeah. -It was me.

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.470
Someone was trying to poison me

19
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.170
but Yuri drank it instead.

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.470
"If you want to live, stay away from the Black Bunny Restaurant"

21
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.770
I see.

22
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.570
So you received this letter.

23
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.970
Yeah, but Yuri was poisoned instead of me.

24
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.870
But your glasses were totally different shapes.

25
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.270
What?

26
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.570
Ms. Yuri's glass was a skinny champagne glass,

27
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.370
and yours was a standard highball glass.

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.970
I don't think they'd mix them up.

29
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.070
Then Ms. Yuri really was the culprit's intended victim.

30
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.570
It could only have been poisoned by Mr. Morooka,

31
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870
who passed by Ms. Yuri as she held her glass

32
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.970
before she left the table.

33
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.570
Or Mr. Fukamachi, who was sitting next to her

34
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.470
when she placed her glass on the table

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.570
when she was startled by the phone alarm.

36
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.970
Or Ms. Murakami, one of the restaurant employee,

37
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.470
who spilled red wine on her white cuffs

38
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.470
and created a reason for her to leave the table.

39
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.170
As far as I can recall,

40
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.870
only those three could've poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass.

41
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.070
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

42
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.070
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

43
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.470
As he determines how the glass was poisoned,

44
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.570
a strange memory emerges in the back of Amuro's mind!

45
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.170
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.070
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:34.928
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 2)"

49
00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:40.428
You went to your car to get his glasses?

50
00:04:40.428 --> 00:04:44.228
You, the master of your butler, Mr. Fukamachi?

51
00:04:44.228 --> 00:04:47.828
Yeah. I'm the one who accidentally stepped on

52
00:04:47.828 --> 00:04:51.128
and broke his glasses that had fallen beneath the table.

53
00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:55.128
Glasses?

54
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:59.128
The sauce for the rolled omelets was next to Fukamachi.

55
00:05:00.228 --> 00:05:02.428
These rolled omelets look delicious.

56
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:04.828
Let's eat.

57
00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:06.728
Let's see...

58
00:05:06.728 --> 00:05:10.528
Fukamachi, could you pass the sauce?

59
00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:12.428
Huh? What?

60
00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:14.128
Fine.

61
00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:17.728
But when I tried to get it, they snapped.

62
00:05:17.728 --> 00:05:19.028
Right?

63
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:23.628
-Yes. -But why were your glasses under the table?

64
00:05:23.628 --> 00:05:25.028
I remember wiping the lenses

65
00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:29.228
and setting them on top of the table.

66
00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:34.128
I'm not sure where to look in this type of establishment.

67
00:05:34.128 --> 00:05:36.428
I probably bumped them with my elbow

68
00:05:36.428 --> 00:05:38.728
and knocked them off.

69
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:42.128
I said it was dangerous for him to get his spare glasses

70
00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:44.428
when his eyesight is so bad.

71
00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:47.028
I'll get them for you.

72
00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:48.628
Thank you.

73
00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:52.628
They're in the glove box.

74
00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:55.528
I see. So that's why.

75
00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:58.028
You have strange tastes though.

76
00:05:58.028 --> 00:05:59.928
Sauce on rolled omelets?

77
00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:02.128
What? It's good.

78
00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:04.028
Come to think of it,

79
00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.928
Yuri put sauce on her rolled omelets too.

80
00:06:06.928 --> 00:06:10.528
She said she picked up the habit from someone else. See?

81
00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:12.628
"Sauce"

82
00:06:12.628 --> 00:06:15.728
Huh. Other people do it too.

83
00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:20.528
In any case, I don't have a single reason to poison her.

84
00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:23.628
She was my favorite.

85
00:06:23.628 --> 00:06:25.428
That's what you say

86
00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:29.928
but maybe she was pressuring you to marry her.

87
00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:31.228
What?

88
00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:33.728
Maybe she put sauce on her rolled omelets

89
00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:36.828
because she picked up the habit from you, her lover.

90
00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:38.628
I...

91
00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:41.928
You fabricated the threatening letter yourself too.

92
00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:43.228
Was your plan to make us believe

93
00:06:43.228 --> 00:06:45.328
she was poisoned in your place

94
00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:48.728
and murder her

95
00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:52.328
before your wife found out you had a mistress?

96
00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.128
You can't be serious!

97
00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:57.528
How far apart in age do you think we are?

98
00:06:57.528 --> 00:07:00.928
And besides, my wife passed away six months ago.

99
00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:02.228
She was sick.

100
00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:03.328
What?

101
00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:11.528
I see. You accidentally triggered the phone's alarm.

102
00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:15.028
Everyone in the restaurant, including the victim,

103
00:07:15.028 --> 00:07:16.928
believed it was an earthquake alert,

104
00:07:16.928 --> 00:07:19.928
so they set their glasses down to check their phones?

105
00:07:19.928 --> 00:07:21.228
Yes.

106
00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:24.228
I was trying to check my messages

107
00:07:24.228 --> 00:07:27.228
while my master was getting my glasses.

108
00:07:28.928 --> 00:07:29.928
No way.

109
00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:31.428
An earthquake?

110
00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:35.828
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:37.728
It suddenly starting ringing

112
00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:40.328
while I was checking my messages.

113
00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:41.528
Let me see that.

114
00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:47.428
Which means you weren't wearing your glasses then?

115
00:07:47.428 --> 00:07:51.228
No, so I couldn't see clearly.

116
00:07:51.228 --> 00:07:56.428
I couldn't tell who set their glass on the table.

117
00:07:56.428 --> 00:07:59.028
Besides, they're all dressed similarly.

118
00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:00.928
That's what you say

119
00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:04.528
but maybe you had surgery to improve your eyesight.

120
00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:05.628
If that's what you think,

121
00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:08.928
try putting on my glasses.

122
00:08:10.728 --> 00:08:12.228
These are intense!

123
00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:16.728
In fact, I'm surprised you can see anything wearing these.

124
00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:20.428
I've never worn contact lenses or anything like that either.

125
00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:24.528
Even if I were, those lenses would be on my person

126
00:08:24.528 --> 00:08:27.428
or somewhere around me.

127
00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:30.928
You're welcome to look for them.

128
00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:33.428
In the first place, like my master,

129
00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:35.028
I don't have a motive.

130
00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:38.828
We only ever come here while we're waiting.

131
00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:40.728
While you're waiting?

132
00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:46.328
The master patronizes the clothing store next to this one.

133
00:08:46.328 --> 00:08:49.228
We only come here to pass the time

134
00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:52.628
while the suits he purchased are being tailored.

135
00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:55.228
Isn't that right, sir?

136
00:08:55.228 --> 00:08:56.428
Yeah.

137
00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:00.828
I told you I just bumped into her

138
00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:03.828
and spilled a little wine on her.

139
00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:06.328
"Sana Murakami (28), Employee" -I'm not some super spy.

140
00:09:06.328 --> 00:09:08.128
I couldn't have poisoned Yuri's glass

141
00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:09.928
in that fraction of a second.

142
00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:14.228
Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:16.428
In that case, neither could I.

144
00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:18.128
I couldn't have poisoned her glass

145
00:09:18.128 --> 00:09:20.028
when I passed by her.

146
00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:24.228
Well, we weren't there when it happened.

147
00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:25.528
We can't speak on the matter.

148
00:09:25.528 --> 00:09:29.728
Besides, how would I benefit from poisoning Yuri?

149
00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:31.328
If there is one, tell me!

150
00:09:31.328 --> 00:09:32.628
Well...

151
00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:35.528
You didn't want to lose the number one spot to her.

152
00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:36.528
What?

153
00:09:36.528 --> 00:09:38.928
The other bunnies told me.

154
00:09:38.928 --> 00:09:40.028
Every six months,

155
00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:43.428
the highest earning bunny girl is chosen

156
00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:48.528
and she receives a large bonus.

157
00:09:48.528 --> 00:09:52.228
For the past two years, you've been number one,

158
00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:54.328
but lately you'd been worried

159
00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:56.428
since Ms. Yuri was catching up.

160
00:09:56.428 --> 00:10:00.628
Maybe you already bought something expensive

161
00:10:00.628 --> 00:10:02.328
assuming you'd get the bonus

162
00:10:02.328 --> 00:10:04.528
and felt like you had to poison her.

163
00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:05.928
What?

164
00:10:05.928 --> 00:10:07.228
In that case,

165
00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:11.528
tell me what expensive "something" I already purchased!

166
00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:16.728
Conan, do you know who did it?

167
00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:20.628
Wait, what? He was here a second ago.

168
00:10:20.628 --> 00:10:25.528
That boy just asked where the parking lot was and went outside.

169
00:10:25.528 --> 00:10:28.028
With that dark handsome man.

170
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.328
With Amuro?

171
00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:32.828
Yes, the boss did come

172
00:10:32.828 --> 00:10:36.528
to get his butler Mr. Fukamachi's glasses.

173
00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:40.028
He was with the detective Kogoro Mouri.

174
00:10:40.028 --> 00:10:44.828
Did you notice anything unusual then?

175
00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:46.128
Like what?

176
00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:48.328
Like them watching the restaurant

177
00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:51.328
or checking their watches.

178
00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:53.228
Not particularly.

179
00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:57.228
Speaking of unusual,

180
00:10:57.228 --> 00:10:59.828
the boss's weight has been strange, right?

181
00:10:59.828 --> 00:11:02.328
Yeah. He'll suddenly lose a bunch of weight

182
00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.928
and then gain it back.

183
00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:06.328
Maybe there's something bothering him.

184
00:11:06.328 --> 00:11:09.028
And he's been getting injured a lot recently too.

185
00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:12.428
Yeah. He said he tripped on a step.

186
00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:13.728
An injury?

187
00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:18.628
I can't treat you next time even if you get hurt, you know.

188
00:11:18.628 --> 00:11:21.128
Because I'll have to move far away.

189
00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:22.928
It's bye-bye time,

190
00:11:22.928 --> 00:11:24.728
Rei...

191
00:11:24.728 --> 00:11:27.028
Amuro...

192
00:11:27.028 --> 00:11:28.428
Amuro!

193
00:11:30.628 --> 00:11:33.328
What's wrong? You were spacing out.

194
00:11:33.328 --> 00:11:36.228
It's nothing.

195
00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:43.128
Why am I thinking about her now?

196
00:11:56.995 --> 00:12:00.095
According to Amuro's testimony,

197
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:03.895
the victim, Yuri Asakura's glass, could've only been poisoned by

198
00:12:03.895 --> 00:12:06.195
Mr. Gunzo Morooka, who broke his butler's glasses

199
00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:09.895
when left his seat after he stepped on them,

200
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:13.395
to get his spare glasses from the car and passed by Ms. Yuri

201
00:12:13.395 --> 00:12:15.895
while she was holding her glass

202
00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:19.495
or Mr. Atsufumi Fukamachi, who triggered his phone alarm accidentally

203
00:12:19.495 --> 00:12:22.395
and was sitting next to Ms. Yuri's glass

204
00:12:22.395 --> 00:12:25.795
when she set it on the table

205
00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:31.095
to check for an earthquake report on her own phone

206
00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:32.495
or Ms. Sana Murakami,

207
00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:35.295
who later spilled red wine on Ms. Yuri's cuffs

208
00:12:35.295 --> 00:12:39.595
and encouraged her to leave her glass

209
00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:41.795
in order to get new cuffs.

210
00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:45.295
But it took only a moment for Mr. Morooka to pass by her

211
00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:49.095
and Ms. Murakami to spill red wine on her cuffs.

212
00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:52.295
They didn't have time to poison her drink.

213
00:12:52.295 --> 00:12:54.995
And Mr. Fukamachi wasn't wearing his glasses

214
00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:56.795
when he triggered the alarm.

215
00:12:56.795 --> 00:13:01.395
He says he couldn't tell who put which glass where.

216
00:13:02.795 --> 00:13:04.995
We'll have to wait for Ms. Yuri

217
00:13:04.995 --> 00:13:06.995
to regain consciousness after all.

218
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.695
Inspector Megure.

219
00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:09.695
What is it?

220
00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:12.895
Apparently the restaurant staff want to talk to you.

221
00:13:12.895 --> 00:13:15.795
They remembered something.

222
00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.295
What?

223
00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:23.995
The butler, Mr. Fukamachi, came to this store alone?

224
00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:25.195
-Yes. -Yes.

225
00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:30.995
Was it to see Ms. Yuri?

226
00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:35.795
Yes. At first we thought he came to make a reservation.

227
00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:37.095
He said he needed to talk to Yuri

228
00:13:37.095 --> 00:13:38.095
and they headed out back together.

229
00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:39.095
What?

230
00:13:39.095 --> 00:13:42.895
At first, Yuri was smiling while talking to him.

231
00:13:43.995 --> 00:13:46.895
But the moment the butler produced an envelope,

232
00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:49.995
things became awkward.

233
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.095
An envelope?

234
00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:53.395
Do you know what was in it?

235
00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:55.995
I don't know.

236
00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:59.595
He was paying her to cut ties.

237
00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:02.795
You know, as in, "Break up with my master".

238
00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:06.695
And she said, "I won't take your money!"

239
00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:09.095
and rejected his offer.

240
00:14:09.095 --> 00:14:12.595
Does that mean she was Mr. Morooka's lover

241
00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:14.695
and was pushing for marriage?

242
00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:19.895
But why would he come here to drink if she was here?

243
00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:22.295
Then maybe it was the opposite

244
00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:26.195
and he came to ask her to be his lonely master's lover

245
00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:28.295
in exchange for money?

246
00:14:28.295 --> 00:14:31.195
So he retaliated by poisoning her because she refused?

247
00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:33.295
That doesn't sound very likely to...

248
00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:38.395
Stay out of adult conversations, kid!

249
00:14:38.395 --> 00:14:40.195
Dad!

250
00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:44.995
So, when did Mr. Morooka start coming to the store?

251
00:14:44.995 --> 00:14:48.695
About six months ago.

252
00:14:48.695 --> 00:14:51.595
That's exactly around the time his wife passed away.

253
00:14:51.595 --> 00:14:52.595
Yeah.

254
00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:57.995
But he doesn't seem like the type to have a lover.

255
00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:01.395
No, he was quite the ladies' man.

256
00:15:03.895 --> 00:15:08.295
He probably messed around a lot when he was younger.

257
00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:10.695
Come to think of it, he often said

258
00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:13.595
he was a troublemaker in his 20's.

259
00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:15.095
I knew it!

260
00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:17.295
A troublemaker?

261
00:15:17.295 --> 00:15:19.695
There was a girl he liked.

262
00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:21.995
They ran away together

263
00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:25.295
and lived in Tottori for about four years.

264
00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:27.695
He eloped?

265
00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:29.995
Not bad, old man.

266
00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:32.195
But his parents dragged him back home,

267
00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:35.595
and he married the woman he was engaged to.

268
00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:37.995
The butler, Mr. Fukamachi,

269
00:15:37.995 --> 00:15:40.395
came along with that wife.

270
00:15:40.395 --> 00:15:43.895
He originally worked for the wife's family,

271
00:15:43.895 --> 00:15:45.495
but the wife insisted that he come with her

272
00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:48.595
to the Morooka family.

273
00:15:48.595 --> 00:15:52.695
So, what happened to the girl he eloped with?

274
00:15:52.695 --> 00:15:56.595
Who knows? She probably received a ton of money to break up with him.

275
00:15:56.595 --> 00:16:00.695
Morooka family has been wealthy for generations.

276
00:16:00.695 --> 00:16:01.995
Oh, right.

277
00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.095
Yuri's from Tottori too.

278
00:16:04.095 --> 00:16:07.495
That's why the two of them got along.

279
00:16:07.495 --> 00:16:08.595
Come to think of it,

280
00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:11.995
I think Sana's family is from Tottori too.

281
00:16:11.995 --> 00:16:13.095
That's right.

282
00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:17.295
She tries to hide it, but sometimes her speech...

283
00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:23.195
My father's calling.

284
00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:24.495
Is it all right if I answer?

285
00:16:24.495 --> 00:16:26.595
Uh, sure.

286
00:16:26.595 --> 00:16:28.495
Hello, Pop?

287
00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:31.295
Sorry, I'm a bit busy at the moment.

288
00:16:31.295 --> 00:16:33.695
What? What do you want?

289
00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:35.195
Didn't I tell you?

290
00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:36.995
Don't worry about the money.

291
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:40.395
Just focus on getting better.

292
00:16:41.795 --> 00:16:44.595
I'll do something about the money for the surgery.

293
00:16:44.595 --> 00:16:45.695
Don't worry.

294
00:16:45.695 --> 00:16:49.095
You won't die that easily, pop.

295
00:16:49.095 --> 00:16:53.295
We've got the same hard-as-nails red blood flowing in us.

296
00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:56.595
The same red blood.

297
00:16:58.095 --> 00:16:59.295
Red...

298
00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:04.295
Blood?

299
00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:06.095
Amuro, what's wrong?

300
00:17:06.095 --> 00:17:08.295
You've been acting strange.

301
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:10.195
Oh, sorry.

302
00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:13.795
Her again.

303
00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:15.395
But why now?

304
00:17:26.695 --> 00:17:30.195
"Information on Shinichi Kudo. Hurry!"

305
00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:32.195
"Time is money!" -"Rum".

306
00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:36.395
Yes...

307
00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:38.195
I know.

308
00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:50.895
By the way, Ms. Murakami,

309
00:17:50.895 --> 00:17:54.295
when Mr. Fukamachi triggered his phone alarm

310
00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:57.595
and Ms. Yuri set her glass on the table,

311
00:17:57.595 --> 00:17:59.795
where were you?

312
00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:02.395
I was at a different table.

313
00:18:02.395 --> 00:18:03.795
Everyone was making a huge fuss

314
00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:05.495
over the weird sound he made with his phone,

315
00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:07.195
so I came to check it out.

316
00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:11.295
That's when I bumped into Yuri and spilled wine on her.

317
00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:13.395
Isn't that right?

318
00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:14.995
Well, I...

319
00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:18.595
I was out getting Fukamachi's glasses, so...

320
00:18:18.595 --> 00:18:20.595
I remember Ms. Yuri went to replace her left cuff

321
00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:23.495
that had wine spilled on it

322
00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:28.095
shortly after the alarm sounded.

323
00:18:28.095 --> 00:18:29.995
I can't recall

324
00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:32.395
if you were standing next to her when the alarm sounded.

325
00:18:32.395 --> 00:18:34.595
I told you, I wasn't there!

326
00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:38.195
I'm not saying you're lying.

327
00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:41.895
But if it's a question of whether or not you were there...

328
00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:44.295
It's true!

329
00:18:44.295 --> 00:18:47.295
I really was at a different table!

330
00:18:47.295 --> 00:18:49.395
You have to believe me!

331
00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:53.695
What? Concerns?

332
00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:56.995
You're saying Mr. Morooka was worried about something?

333
00:18:56.995 --> 00:19:01.895
Yes. That's what his bodyguards in the parking lot told me.

334
00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:05.195
Lately he has been acting strange.

335
00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:08.195
He'd suddenly lose and gain weight

336
00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:11.595
and was frequently tripping and injuring himself.

337
00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:14.095
Of course he was worried.

338
00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:15.995
He received a threatening letter.

339
00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:16.995
But, Mouri...

340
00:19:16.995 --> 00:19:17.995
An injury?

341
00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:22.695
"Miyano Clinic" -Injury, injury! Injured person here!

342
00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:24.895
Mom, I brought you a patient!

343
00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:26.095
Let go!

344
00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:28.395
-Thank you. -I told it you it was no big deal.

345
00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:30.295
"Elena Miyano (29), Doctor" -But you're bleeding.

346
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:33.195
All this needs is a little spit.

347
00:19:33.195 --> 00:19:36.095
-But... -You again?

348
00:19:36.095 --> 00:19:37.795
You sure do love to fight.

349
00:19:37.795 --> 00:19:39.195
That's not it.

350
00:19:39.195 --> 00:19:42.995
They won't stop making fun of the color of my hair.

351
00:19:42.995 --> 00:19:48.295
Even though I'm Japanese, born and raised...

352
00:19:48.295 --> 00:19:51.695
Is one of your parents a foreigner?

353
00:19:51.695 --> 00:19:53.295
What's wrong with that?

354
00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:58.395
Then tell your friends you fought with this.

355
00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:01.095
Even if people look different,

356
00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:02.595
when you peel back our skin,

357
00:20:02.595 --> 00:20:05.895
we're all just lumps of blood and flesh.

358
00:20:05.895 --> 00:20:09.795
To prove it, every race in the world

359
00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:12.095
has red blood flowing through them,

360
00:20:12.095 --> 00:20:15.395
just like yours.

361
00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:19.395
Got it?

362
00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:20.395
Yeah...

363
00:20:20.395 --> 00:20:22.895
Then let's get you treated. Come in.

364
00:20:24.295 --> 00:20:27.295
"Atsushi Miyano (35), Doctor and Scientist"

365
00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:30.195
All done.

366
00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:33.195
Akemi, put a bandage on him.

367
00:20:33.195 --> 00:20:35.295
Okay. Come with me.

368
00:20:35.295 --> 00:20:36.495
Okay.

369
00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:38.195
How unusual.

370
00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.495
Honey.

371
00:20:39.495 --> 00:20:44.095
You're normally shy and speak the bare minimum with patients,

372
00:20:44.095 --> 00:20:46.195
-but you're so friendly with that boy. -Hold still.

373
00:20:46.195 --> 00:20:48.295
-It hurts! -That boy is special.

374
00:20:48.295 --> 00:20:50.395
He's half, like me.

375
00:20:50.395 --> 00:20:51.695
I see.

376
00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:54.195
Anyway, how'd it go?

377
00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:59.295
Are we transferring to that facility that'll back up your research?

378
00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:02.195
I'm thinking about turning them down.

379
00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:03.395
Why?

380
00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:07.895
I'd hate to leave you guys behind

381
00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:11.695
and your sister said it seemed a little suspicious.

382
00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:15.095
But isn't the Karasuma Group sponsoring them?

383
00:21:15.095 --> 00:21:18.195
Yeah, but I've heard unfavorable rumors about them.

384
00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:22.895
I don't want to be called a mad scientist again.

385
00:21:22.895 --> 00:21:28.595
But your research can't be done part-time as a GP.

386
00:21:28.595 --> 00:21:31.595
If the pay's good, then it's too bad for our patients

387
00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:34.695
but I don't mind closing this clinic to help you.

388
00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:35.895
It's fine.

389
00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:39.695
The three of us are doing just fine as is.

390
00:21:39.695 --> 00:21:40.895
It's four.

391
00:21:40.895 --> 00:21:42.795
Huh? What?

392
00:21:43.895 --> 00:21:45.195
I'm three months along.

393
00:21:45.195 --> 00:21:47.195
Really?

394
00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:50.895
Then maybe I'll reconsider their offer.

395
00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:52.495
It's your dream.

396
00:21:52.495 --> 00:21:54.495
You shouldn't give up on it so easily.

397
00:21:54.495 --> 00:21:56.295
Yeah.

398
00:21:56.295 --> 00:21:57.295
Well...

399
00:21:57.295 --> 00:21:59.295
Well, I'm leaving now.

400
00:22:00.395 --> 00:22:04.295
Can I come back if I get hurt again?

401
00:22:04.295 --> 00:22:07.595
No. We don't treat boys who fight.

402
00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:08.595
What?

403
00:22:08.595 --> 00:22:12.495
But if it's an honorable injury suffered

404
00:22:12.495 --> 00:22:14.595
while making up with the friend you fought with,

405
00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:16.895
then I'll at least put a bandage on you.

406
00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:22.995
I see.

407
00:22:22.995 --> 00:22:24.795
So that's how it is.

408
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.995
"Next Episode" -I found a fake nail.

409
00:23:58.695 --> 00:24:04.095
That's why the culprit was able to poison Ms. Yuri's glass.

410
00:24:04.095 --> 00:24:05.595
I heard you're struggling

411
00:24:05.595 --> 00:24:08.795
to pay for your seriously ill father's surgery!

412
00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:11.595
What? At least I'm not an old man who was trying to pay her

413
00:24:11.595 --> 00:24:13.895
to stop contacting him!

414
00:24:13.895 --> 00:24:18.395
Please don't make your wife sad anymore.

415
00:24:19.095 --> 00:24:24.295
Next Conan, "The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 3)"

416
00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:27.438
Next Conan's Hint:

417
00:24:27.438 --> 00:24:29.138
"Amuro's memory"

418
00:24:29.138 --> 00:24:30.638
Amuro, are you okay?

419
00:24:30.638 --> 00:24:32.238
The case will be fine.

420
00:24:32.238 --> 00:24:34.038
There's something off about him.
