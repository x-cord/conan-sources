1
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.236
Well... So many balls came out today. What a great haul!

2
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.050
I'm super lucky!

3
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.220
I'm going to surprise Ran out of her wits for despising me

4
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.090
for playing pachinko all the time!

5
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
I'm home! The Pachinko King is home!

6
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.630
Hey!

7
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.070
A letter for me?

8
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.190
What's this? "I'm going to the hospital."

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.590
"Why don't you keep your cell phone switched on?"

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.710
"Ran."

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.210
Cell phone?

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770
Oh, no! It's switched off...

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.460
34 missed calls and 16 text mails?

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.460
What?

15
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.300
Mom fell ill at work and is going to have surgery from now!

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.090
I'm at Haido Central Hospital so come quick!

17
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.210
Ran.

18
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

19
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.690
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

20
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.580
Coincidental encounter with Amuro at the Central Hospital.

21
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.780
Four ladies involved in a tea party incident.

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.200
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.930
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.400
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.202
"An Awkward Tea Party (Part 1)"

26
00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:16.922
Eri!

27
00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.359
Eri!

28
00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.324
Eri...

29
00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:26.004
Eri...

30
00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:27.124
"Eri Mouri"

31
00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:28.754
Eri!

32
00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:33.474
What's with you making so much noise?

33
00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:37.884
What do you mean that you're having surgery?

34
00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:40.214
It's mere appendicitis.

35
00:03:40.334 --> 00:03:44.644
The surgery finished a while ago, I'm out of sedation and just got up.

36
00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:48.254
It's mere appendicitis.

37
00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:49.724
What do you mean mere?

38
00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:52.024
Where and what were you doing with your cell phone switched off?

39
00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:54.624
I'm sure you were either at the horse races,

40
00:03:54.644 --> 00:03:56.744
playing mahjong or at the pachinko parlor, right?

41
00:03:56.864 --> 00:03:59.294
Idiot... I was working...

42
00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:01.494
Playing pachinko, right?

43
00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:07.404
Because your clothes got a strange looking wrinkle on your jacket.

44
00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:11.674
That goes to show you were sitting for a long time in a chair, right?

45
00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:14.004
On, no, well you see...

46
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.504
Besides, you had your cell phone switched off

47
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.024
because you were in a noisy place

48
00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:22.224
where you couldn't hear the phone anyway, right?

49
00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:25.024
And Pops, you don't like to have your cell phone on vibration

50
00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:27.024
because it doesn't feel good.

51
00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.274
And see! You've got a pachinko ball

52
00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:32.524
stuck between your shoelace!

53
00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:37.034
So, you were at the pachinko parlor after all!

54
00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:40.104
That's amazing, Conan!

55
00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:43.814
I just happened to be watching a detective story that went just like this.

56
00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.494
I see.

57
00:04:45.824 --> 00:04:49.754
So you were playing pachinko while I was going through a lot.

58
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:51.693
What?

59
00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:55.634
Actually I just went to kill time for a while

60
00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.123
but I happened to hit the jackpot that doesn't happen everyday you see.

61
00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:04.894
So you go on and let out what you have to too and get discharged soon!

62
00:05:07.044 --> 00:05:08.434
Oh, see...

63
00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:10.292
they say that when you get your appendix taken out,

64
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:11.944
you're ready to be discharged once you fart, right?

65
00:05:12.064 --> 00:05:17.854
I hope you don't think you created a fancy pun just now.

66
00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:22.514
Well, I thought it was quite a pun.

67
00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:26.064
Get out of here! You goofy detective!

68
00:05:28.944 --> 00:05:30.184
I tell you...

69
00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:33.924
I just came over because I was worried and she gets all worked up...

70
00:05:34.044 --> 00:05:36.594
I don't blame her...

71
00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:40.264
Aren't you Mr. Mouri?

72
00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.554
What are you doing in a place like this?

73
00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:45.554
Bourbon?

74
00:05:45.984 --> 00:05:50.184
-Are you ill? -Well... My wife, you see...

75
00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:52.304
Why?

76
00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:56.544
Why is a member of the Black Organization here at Haido Central Hospital?

77
00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:01.194
Don't tell me that... It can't be... Don't tell me that...

78
00:06:01.584 --> 00:06:03.104
What brings you here?

79
00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:08.034
I heard that an acquaintance of mine was hospitalized so I came to visit

80
00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:10.454
but I guess I didn't make it in time...

81
00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:14.214
The nurses mentioned that you've been here before, Conan.

82
00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:17.414
Do you happen to know?

83
00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:21.714
A man called Rikumichi Kusuda?

84
00:06:22.244 --> 00:06:24.974
Who's that? No.

85
00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:29.954
I lent that man some money and I want it back.

86
00:06:30.074 --> 00:06:32.484
-Are you sure you don't know him? -Yes.

87
00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:36.254
You're really something.

88
00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:40.124
Excuse me...

89
00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:43.555
Do you know an in patient called Rikumichi Kusuda?

90
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.065
"Kazuki Beppu (41)" -Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda?

91
00:06:46.464 --> 00:06:49.614
I wonder... What kind of person is he? How old is he?

92
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.477
"Tokie Happo (42)" -Do you have his picture or something?

93
00:06:52.604 --> 00:06:55.864
-Oh, no... Never mind already... -Are you sure?

94
00:06:57.824 --> 00:06:59.724
How about you, Mr. Mouri?

95
00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:01.834
What would you do if somebody suddenly gave you a name

96
00:07:01.844 --> 00:07:03.434
and asked if you knew him?

97
00:07:03.554 --> 00:07:07.474
Well... I would do the same as they did...

98
00:07:08.154 --> 00:07:09.266
That's right.

99
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:13.559
Most people are not really sure whether they remember something correctly.

100
00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:15.984
That's why before they say no,

101
00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:17.334
they want to know other information

102
00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:20.234
besides the name of the person that is being sought.

103
00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:23.504
That's why you're really something, Conan!

104
00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:28.434
You were confident you didn't know that person just by hearing his name.

105
00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:32.454
Don't take what a kid says seriously...

106
00:07:33.074 --> 00:07:35.560
There are millions of people you've met

107
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.828
but don't know their names.

108
00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:38.344
There are also those that you only know

109
00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:41.094
-by their nicknames too. -Three! Two! One!

110
00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:42.554
Zero!

111
00:07:52.564 --> 00:07:55.644
-Mommy, the elevator's here! -Okay.

112
00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:57.164
Hurry, hurry!

113
00:07:58.404 --> 00:08:01.444
-What's wrong? -Oh, no.

114
00:08:01.894 --> 00:08:05.124
My nickname's also Zero, so I thought somebody called me...

115
00:08:05.244 --> 00:08:08.824
Why, Zero? Your name's Tohru, right?

116
00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:11.454
Tohru in Japanese means transparent, in other words, nil.

117
00:08:12.134 --> 00:08:13.244
Therefore, Zero...

118
00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:17.964
That's how children tend to make nicknames after all.

119
00:08:22.414 --> 00:08:24.134
Rikumichi Kusuda?

120
00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:26.966
What about that person?

121
00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:30.676
Somebody asked me about him in the corridor a while ago.

122
00:08:30.796 --> 00:08:32.996
"Juri Kosaka (42)" -I don't know that person either.

123
00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:34.336
I'm staying in an individual unit

124
00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:38.296
and I don't have much opportunity to talk to other patients, you see...

125
00:08:38.466 --> 00:08:42.406
Congratulations! I heard you'll be discharged tomorrow!

126
00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:45.796
-Yes. -I wish you'd have told me.

127
00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:48.306
If so, I wouldn't have had to come see you, right?

128
00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:50.686
-Thanks for waiting! -Oh, Reina!

129
00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:53.236
"Reina Suto (42)" -You both are here!

130
00:08:53.244 --> 00:08:55.236
Okay then, let's have a tea party!

131
00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:58.966
-I just went and got some hot water too! -Why not?

132
00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:03.236
Would you please take three tea cups out of that cabinet, please?

133
00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:04.846
Is three enough?

134
00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:08.126
I have my own cup, you see.

135
00:09:09.186 --> 00:09:12.016
Oh, new teacups?

136
00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:15.352
-Is it okay to use these? -Yes.

137
00:09:15.473 --> 00:09:20.446
I get rid of the tea stains using baking soda, so they just look new.

138
00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:22.896
You're really scrupulous, after all.

139
00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:25.266
I bought lemon too!

140
00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:29.016
You still liked lemons.

141
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:32.696
I wonder if the teabags that I bought when coming to visit today are okay?

142
00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:36.036
As to that. There are so many here already...

143
00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:40.003
Why don't we try drinking and comparing various kinds of tea?

144
00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:41.540
Sounds great!

145
00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:44.336
This is a real girls' tea party, isn't it?

146
00:09:44.456 --> 00:09:47.406
I guess you could call it an advance discharge party.

147
00:09:48.206 --> 00:09:52.666
Your wife had acute appendicitis?

148
00:09:52.786 --> 00:09:55.416
Yeah... I got all worked up for nothing.

149
00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:59.086
But they say it's dangerous to take appendicitis lightly.

150
00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.676
I guess so.

151
00:10:00.926 --> 00:10:03.876
Don't tell me... He's...

152
00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:09.276
This picture's so nostalgic.

153
00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:11.146
It was taken during the school festival.

154
00:10:11.366 --> 00:10:14.676
Do you keep all your old photos in your cell phone?

155
00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:17.276
Only the ones that I like.

156
00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:20.546
Wasn't it during this school festival?

157
00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.776
That when you got it Sosaki, right, Reina?

158
00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.856
Who's Sosaki?

159
00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:28.826
The most popular guy in our class.

160
00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:30.536
Was there a guy like that?

161
00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:34.626
You're really a lucky person, Reina.

162
00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:37.166
I don't think so!

163
00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:41.966
The other day I was almost about to lose a large sum of stocks!

164
00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:46.216
My hubby's a mere nouveau riche!

165
00:10:46.538 --> 00:10:49.141
When my son had to take an exam, I thought he had a cold,

166
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.606
but he ended up with influenza, you see...

167
00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:53.806
If I didn't realize soon enough, it could've been a tragedy!

168
00:10:55.496 --> 00:10:57.246
My life's like walking on tight rope...

169
00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:59.986
One mistake and I would've been in the pits.

170
00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:16.996
The scream came from this room, right?

171
00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:18.116
Yes.

172
00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:20.966
Is something wrong?

173
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.726
-Reina? -Reina!

174
00:11:39.296 --> 00:11:42.626
But poisoning somebody in a hospital.

175
00:11:42.746 --> 00:11:46.556
It seems to have been too late by the time the doctor got here.

176
00:11:46.986 --> 00:11:49.236
And who is the victim?

177
00:11:49.356 --> 00:11:53.936
A resident of Haidocho, Ms. Reina Suto, age 42.

178
00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:57.556
It seems she came here today

179
00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.876
to visit her high school classmate Ms. Juri Kosaka,

180
00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:02.826
who had been hospitalized,

181
00:12:02.946 --> 00:12:05.446
with her other two classmates.

182
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:10.456
It seems that Ms. Suto got here before her two other friends though.

183
00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:16.946
The cause of death seems to be suffocation from cyanide poisoning.

184
00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:18.075
Yes.

185
00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:22.676
Why were they drinking black tea in the hospital to begin with?

186
00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:26.316
It seems that Ms. Kosaka, the patient, like black tea,

187
00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:30.596
so every time they got together, they used to have tea parties.

188
00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:31.716
I see.

189
00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:33.874
Which means that the three knew that

190
00:12:33.894 --> 00:12:38.156
they would have a chance to poison the victim.

191
00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:44.276
But the victim seems to have drunk several cups without anything happening.

192
00:12:44.402 --> 00:12:47.326
-It seems she suddenly choked and collapsed. -What?

193
00:12:47.646 --> 00:12:52.056
Maybe somebody gave her a poison laced capsule or something beforehand.

194
00:12:52.176 --> 00:12:56.436
Which means that this may not be the place the murder was committed.

195
00:12:56.556 --> 00:12:59.336
What? It's strange.

196
00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:01.606
-What? -Because see.

197
00:13:01.726 --> 00:13:05.776
There are a lot of pictures in the cell phone that was on the floor here,

198
00:13:05.896 --> 00:13:09.536
but the lady that passed away is holding chopsticks with her right hand!

199
00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:16.136
Hey! Don't go touching the personal effects of the deceased!

200
00:13:16.846 --> 00:13:18.996
But, what's strange about it?

201
00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:20.666
We usually hold chopsticks with the right hand.

202
00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:23.446
But, the cup that dropped to the floor and cracked...

203
00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:25.596
Take a real close look...

204
00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:30.616
Lipstick is on the right side of the handle of the cup!

205
00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:33.876
This shows that she was drinking tea

206
00:13:33.894 --> 00:13:35.476
while holding the cup with her left hand, right?

207
00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:37.166
True...

208
00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:40.956
But, why was the victim holding it with her left hand?

209
00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:44.396
Because her right hand was blocked with something.

210
00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:51.466
For example, maybe she was looking at the pictures in her cell phone.

211
00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.766
-The pictures... -In her cell phone?

212
00:13:55.016 --> 00:13:57.906
Right. When people are absorbed in something,

213
00:13:57.994 --> 00:14:00.406
they seem to get careless with other things.

214
00:14:00.526 --> 00:14:01.876
That is, even if the position of their cup

215
00:14:01.894 --> 00:14:04.106
or direction of the handle of the cup is changed,

216
00:14:04.226 --> 00:14:06.216
they pick it up without a thought.

217
00:14:06.336 --> 00:14:09.353
The perpetrator probably made the victim drink the poison

218
00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:11.376
by taking advantage of this mentality

219
00:14:11.496 --> 00:14:15.996
by switching her cup with the victim's.

220
00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:17.936
Switched cups?

221
00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:25.176
Yes, the risk is lower if the perpetrator puts poison in her own cup

222
00:14:25.294 --> 00:14:27.316
and switches it with the victims,

223
00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:29.466
than to try to lace the victim's cup with poison without being noticed.

224
00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:33.536
Since they didn't seem to be using a saucer,

225
00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.976
it would've been easy to move the cups around.

226
00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:38.276
Don't you agree, Mr. Mouri?

227
00:14:38.396 --> 00:14:40.516
Oh, yeah... Well, I guess so...

228
00:14:41.856 --> 00:14:43.526
Not this detective again.

229
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.166
There's no way the cups could've been switched!

230
00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.796
Only she used lemon.

231
00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:52.866
Besides, take a good look at the color of everyone's tea, will you?

232
00:14:52.986 --> 00:14:54.216
Color?

233
00:14:57.676 --> 00:14:59.896
All three of them are of different color.

234
00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:03.206
From the right, it's brown, blue and yellow.

235
00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:07.886
The one that the victim was drinking was a reddish colored tea.

236
00:15:08.006 --> 00:15:11.676
True, that there's no way you could make a mistake then.

237
00:15:11.866 --> 00:15:15.316
At any rate, if the tea was laced with poison,

238
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:19.436
the container or package that the poison was in, should be somewhere.

239
00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:22.176
If we check this hospital out thoroughly,

240
00:15:22.194 --> 00:15:25.306
-don't you think we'll come up with something? -Yes.

241
00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:29.446
The perpetrator could probably have it on her too.

242
00:15:29.706 --> 00:15:35.196
So, after the three of you are body checked,

243
00:15:35.316 --> 00:15:39.076
you will all be interrogated in separate rooms.

244
00:15:39.596 --> 00:15:41.076
Do you understand?

245
00:15:44.826 --> 00:15:46.336
Yes, sir...

246
00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:50.086
Yes, that's right.

247
00:15:50.476 --> 00:15:53.156
Yes, I served everyone's tea.

248
00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:57.596
Although they came to visit me, they were my guests, after all.

249
00:15:57.936 --> 00:15:59.476
Well, I served everyone all right,

250
00:15:59.494 --> 00:16:03.926
but all I did was put the tea bags in the cups.

251
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:07.106
Then, are you the only one who touched the cups?

252
00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:08.876
Oh, no...

253
00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:14.116
I had Ms. Happo and Ms. Beppu take the cups out of the cabinet for me.

254
00:16:14.436 --> 00:16:16.174
Which means that all your fingerprints

255
00:16:16.194 --> 00:16:20.306
would be on the cup of the victim?

256
00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:24.006
But why were so many different types of tea served?

257
00:16:24.126 --> 00:16:26.126
Normally, you'd serve only one type, right?

258
00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:29.476
Since everyone knew that I like herb tea,

259
00:16:29.494 --> 00:16:32.426
people brought me quite a lot of tea as gifts when visiting.

260
00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:35.286
Since Ms. Happo also brought some,

261
00:16:35.406 --> 00:16:38.174
we decided to drink various kinds of tea and compare drinking them.

262
00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:39.994
I see.

263
00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:43.376
Since you were the one who suggested drinking various types of tea

264
00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:45.976
and served them as well,

265
00:16:46.276 --> 00:16:47.876
you would've been most likely among the three of you

266
00:16:47.894 --> 00:16:51.196
to serve the poison laced tea, isn't that right?

267
00:16:51.316 --> 00:16:53.606
I would never do such a thing!

268
00:16:54.026 --> 00:16:57.086
I poured the tea in front of everyone as they watched,

269
00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:59.876
and besides, Ms. Suto had drunk almost half of her tea

270
00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:02.116
before she collapsed.

271
00:17:02.446 --> 00:17:04.996
Besides, as you mentioned a while ago,

272
00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:08.936
if I did switch the poison laced cup with hers,

273
00:17:09.056 --> 00:17:11.556
it would've been apparent in my case.

274
00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:13.626
What? Why is that?

275
00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:16.476
Because the tea I was drinking back then

276
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:20.176
is called Butterfly Pea herb tea that is blue.

277
00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:23.636
So, I'm sure that everyone would've noticed if I made them switched.

278
00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:29.896
Ms. Suto was drinking Hibiscus tea, a red colored herb tea.

279
00:17:30.206 --> 00:17:34.486
Then do you know what type of tea the other two were drinking?

280
00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:36.046
Yes.

281
00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:40.226
Ms. Happo was drinking brown peppermint tea,

282
00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:44.746
and Ms. Beppu was drinking yellow Chamomile tea, I think it was...

283
00:17:47.456 --> 00:17:50.996
I was drinking Peppermint.

284
00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:53.436
I thought it was going to be a green colored tea,

285
00:17:53.556 --> 00:17:56.676
but was thrown off when it was brown.

286
00:17:56.796 --> 00:17:59.886
I mean, they say peppermint green too, right.

287
00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:04.346
Juri who is knowledgeable about tea was chuckling though.

288
00:18:04.756 --> 00:18:08.266
Brown and red sort of look similar

289
00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:10.446
so you would've been able to switch the cups...

290
00:18:10.566 --> 00:18:12.356
They don't look at all similar!

291
00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:15.066
Mine was brown tea that you usually see around a lot,

292
00:18:15.186 --> 00:18:17.836
while Reina's was a really vivid red color!

293
00:18:17.956 --> 00:18:19.986
It could never be mistaken, don't you think?

294
00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:25.406
-Did you each decide what tea to drink? -Yes.

295
00:18:25.526 --> 00:18:27.996
The tea was lined out on the table, we selected the one we wanted.

296
00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:31.066
After finished drinking, we'd wipe our cups with tissue paper

297
00:18:31.186 --> 00:18:33.076
and went on to the next one.

298
00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:38.006
Juri had been drinking the blue tea from way before we arrived though.

299
00:18:38.256 --> 00:18:39.376
She said it was good for the body but because it tastes bitter,

300
00:18:39.394 --> 00:18:41.506
she wouldn't recommend it.

301
00:18:41.826 --> 00:18:45.756
-By the way, how were you all seated? -Let's see.

302
00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:51.716
We sat clockwise, me, Reina, Kazuki and Juri, I think.

303
00:18:52.106 --> 00:18:54.276
Because Kazuki and I were looking in at the pictures

304
00:18:54.396 --> 00:18:58.526
in Reina's cell phone from both sides.

305
00:18:59.094 --> 00:19:02.244
Who suggested looking at the pictures?

306
00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:06.596
Kazuki! It seems that Juri had shown her the pictures before.

307
00:19:06.716 --> 00:19:07.776
She also told us,

308
00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:10.806
"Let's have her show us the pictures when we go to visit her."

309
00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:14.416
But, Reina refused to let go of the cell phone.

310
00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:17.416
That's why both Kazuki and I ended up peeking in from the side.

311
00:19:19.786 --> 00:19:21.976
She's always been that way.

312
00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:25.946
She was strongly dominant, selfish, and nonchalant.

313
00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:28.916
Her hubby used to be my boyfriend!

314
00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:31.726
She snatched him away from me you see!

315
00:19:32.536 --> 00:19:37.576
But, that doesn't mean that I wanted to kill her or anything.

316
00:19:38.606 --> 00:19:39.786
I see...

317
00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:41.376
Well, if someone were to have a grudge against her,

318
00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:43.866
it would be Kazuki, more than me, I think?

319
00:19:44.836 --> 00:19:45.876
Because she was furious saying

320
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:48.196
that thanks to Reina, she incurred a great loss.

321
00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:49.366
A great loss?

322
00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:54.126
Of course I'd be furious!

323
00:19:54.296 --> 00:19:57.376
The stocks that Reina recommended me to get took a plunge

324
00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.256
and I ended up with a great loss,

325
00:19:59.786 --> 00:20:01.876
but Reina on the other hand, sold it before it went down

326
00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:03.726
and really made out!

327
00:20:03.846 --> 00:20:06.896
-Our sympathies. -Our sympathies.

328
00:20:07.016 --> 00:20:09.676
Thanks to that I'm soaked in debt now.

329
00:20:09.796 --> 00:20:13.006
If she knew it was going to go down, she should've told me.

330
00:20:13.506 --> 00:20:14.896
Is that why you killed her?

331
00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:19.646
If her death would bring my money back, maybe I would have.

332
00:20:23.106 --> 00:20:26.716
I don't want to talk bad about somebody who passed away

333
00:20:26.836 --> 00:20:30.536
but I'm sure that Juri has a load of pent up anger inside her too.

334
00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:35.836
Because thanks to Reina her son failed the entrance exam.

335
00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:38.336
Failed?

336
00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:42.136
Juri and Reina's son were in the same grade,

337
00:20:42.256 --> 00:20:44.746
and were studying towards going to the same Junior High School.

338
00:20:44.866 --> 00:20:48.226
But a day before the exam, Reina's son who came over to study

339
00:20:48.346 --> 00:20:49.996
had influenza.

340
00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:52.286
Juri's son caught it

341
00:20:52.406 --> 00:20:54.856
and was in no condition to take the exam!

342
00:20:54.976 --> 00:20:58.596
-Our sympathies once again. -Our sympathies once again.

343
00:20:59.116 --> 00:21:00.576
Juri was all smiles before he took the exam saying that

344
00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:04.106
she was sure going to have good news to report about soon.

345
00:21:07.116 --> 00:21:09.486
In other words, it would mean that all three of you

346
00:21:09.494 --> 00:21:13.586
had some kind of motive to want to kill the victim.

347
00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:15.746
-Yes. -Like I already said...

348
00:21:15.986 --> 00:21:19.096
We didn't do it!

349
00:21:19.426 --> 00:21:22.426
We may have had grudges against her

350
00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:25.886
but Reina was always the way she was,

351
00:21:25.894 --> 00:21:28.386
so we all took her for what she was.

352
00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:30.886
Hey.

353
00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:36.146
Did anyone leave the room while you all started drinking tea?

354
00:21:36.266 --> 00:21:37.526
Yes.

355
00:21:37.646 --> 00:21:41.396
Tokie and I, once each.

356
00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:43.196
I went to the restroom

357
00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:46.046
and Tokie went to buy candy to go with the tea.

358
00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:49.646
I think that Juri and Reina were both in the room right through.

359
00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:53.026
It seems that Reina went to get hot water to put in the thermos.

360
00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:56.916
That was before Tokie and I got here though...

361
00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:02.766
-It hurts! -Since when were you here?

362
00:22:02.886 --> 00:22:05.296
Is that teacup the hospital's?

363
00:22:05.506 --> 00:22:08.436
That's Juri's cup.

364
00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:12.306
She said she uses baking soda to polish it spic and span.

365
00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:17.576
Which means the only person who could've laced poison

366
00:22:17.594 --> 00:22:20.316
and make the victim drink it...

367
00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:27.636
The question is how that person made the victim pick that cup up.

368
00:23:50.369 --> 00:23:51.376
"Next Episode"

369
00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:53.326
The rim of the teacup?

370
00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:56.236
Poison was laced there?

371
00:23:56.676 --> 00:23:58.826
But, the perpetrator sure has guts. Don't you think so?

372
00:24:00.356 --> 00:24:03.166
How about it? Do you follow?

373
00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:05.774
The person who wait scrupulously for a chance

374
00:24:05.794 --> 00:24:11.774
to switch her cup with that of the victims.

375
00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:15.294
The only one who could've done this is you.

376
00:24:15.312 --> 00:24:19.952
Next Conan, "An Awkward Tea Party (Part 2)"

377
00:24:36.146 --> 00:24:38.326
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:38.446 --> 00:24:40.156
"Lemon"

379
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:42.886
-Lemon reminds me of Shinichi. -Is that so?

380
00:24:43.006 --> 00:24:45.636
-He must be a sour guy. -I'm not.
