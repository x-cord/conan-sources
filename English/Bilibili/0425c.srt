1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,646
It's the opposite. Really bad.

2
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:03,146
Think about it carefully.

3
00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:06,546
If the transmitter and wiretap are found by them,

4
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:09,646
they'll naturally try to figure out who set it up.

5
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:12,046
And, the first person to be suspected would be the one

6
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,746
who was at that announcer's place until just a while ago,

7
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:17,846
Detective Kogoro Mouri!

8
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:19,746
Hey, don't tell me that...

9
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:20,846
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:24,246
Even if Pops were to have set them up

11
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:28,146
to investigate the case she asked him to take on.

12
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:32,846
The chance that he may have heard their conversation cannot be denied.

13
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,346
If this happens, those guys would most likely...

14
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:38,146
Get to work trying to shut him up.

15
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,046
Not only Kogoro Mouri.

16
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:45,446
But if need be, every single person around him.

17
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,846
No way...

18
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:51,246
In other words, the more information comes through the transmitter,

19
00:00:51,246 --> 00:00:56,446
the more the necks of both Pops and I are being choked.

20
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:59,246
Then, we have to retrieve them

21
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,446
as soon as possible before those guys find them.

22
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,846
But I just don't get it.

23
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:07,646
That announcer asked Detective Mouri

24
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:10,546
to nab the one who was ringing her doorbell and running away, right?

25
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:13,246
Moreover, the culprit turned out to be a kid.

26
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:16,046
If she were one of them, she would never...

27
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:17,146
Yeah.

28
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,346
That's the part that bugs me too.

29
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,546
The movement of the transmitter has slowed down.

30
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:36,246
Besides the sound of the engine is echoing.

31
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:38,446
Which means...

32
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,746
She went into an indoor parking lot somewhere.

33
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:45,446
Which means that she'll be meeting those guys in that building somewhere.

34
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:49,646
She's approaching something...

35
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:50,746
Is it a car?

36
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:59,546
This unique uneven sound of idling...

37
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:04,546
And...

38
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:09,146
The sound of the engine revving is that of a horizontally opposed engine.

39
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,546
Hey, don't tell me that...

40
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:11,846
Yeah...

41
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:13,846
The only cars equipped with this engine

42
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:16,246
are either Volkswagens, Subaru or...

43
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:17,846
that guy's beloved vehicle.

44
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:20,946
Porsche. That's all.

45
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:41,846
What's up, Kir?

46
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:44,646
You promised to be here at 10 am.

47
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:45,946
Gin!

48
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,446
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:49,746
A car seems to have been tailing me

50
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,946
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

51
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:54,246
Don't tell me that she's referring to our car?

52
00:02:56,946 --> 00:03:00,646
No, because we kept more than 600 m away from her car.

53
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,246
It couldn't be us.

54
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:06,446
Are you sure you're not in trouble?

55
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,946
Yes. I was just being too overly concerned.

56
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:12,746
So, will you put that Beretta that you're aiming out the window

57
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,446
back into it's case?

58
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,146
If you shoot me because you don't trust me...

59
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,546
You won't be able to kill DJ, right?

60
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:23,946
DJ...

61
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,946
What does that mean?

62
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:27,746
Okay.

63
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:32,646
We have 500 m of all the four directions of this building covered.

64
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,946
If an unwanted car approaches,

65
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:37,246
we'll know right of the bat.

66
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:40,346
Dr. Agasa.

67
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,446
Will you pull the car over slowly to the shoulder of the road.

68
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:43,446
What?

69
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:46,146
After stopping wear your hood and go outside.

70
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:48,146
Then, pretend that you're checking the car.

71
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,646
Quick!

72
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,746
Okay.

73
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:05,046
Here goes the final confirmation.

74
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:06,646
Go ahead.

75
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,046
Time is 13:00.

76
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:11,846
Place is Edie P...

77
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:17,146
I, as the interviewer, will guide DJ to the designated place.

78
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:18,346
Yes...

79
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:21,046
We'll be waiting for you, Kir.

80
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:24,146
Shove the prey right into the center of my scope

81
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:28,246
and excite me.

82
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:30,746
My, Chianti...

83
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,446
Korn's with you too, isn't he?

84
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,646
How encouraging.

85
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,446
Kir, Chianti, Korn.

86
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,946
How many of them are they, anyway?

87
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,346
I'm counting on you all.

88
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:46,746
Our achievements will never see the light.

89
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:50,846
But when we fail, the word goes around really quickly.

90
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:56,746
Whether we succeed or not, nobody will know about it.

91
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,246
That's how the organization works.

92
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,846
Yeah. That's right.

93
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:04,446
Okay. It's almost time.

94
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:06,246
Hurry and finish what you have to.

95
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:10,346
Will you work it out

96
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:12,346
so that I don't have to do anything?

97
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,446
Vermouth!

98
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:15,646
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

99
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:16,946
How come?

100
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,846
Why is this lady here?

101
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,346
Nobody told me!

102
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:23,746
How come this lady who took Calvados out on his own and left him to die

103
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:25,946
is included in this project!

104
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:28,746
Go back to the car, Chianti.

105
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,646
We're keeping her here just in case.

106
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,646
But...

107
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:39,546
This is his order too, you know?

108
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,446
The place is Edie P.

109
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:55,246
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

110
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:56,246
What?

111
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,046
What do you mean by that?

112
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:04,146
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

113
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:06,146
Yeah.

114
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:09,546
What's more of a problem is the rain.

115
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:11,146
Don't worry.

116
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:14,246
It'll clear up before noon. The weather forecast...

117
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:18,746
Darn it! It's raining so hard

118
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,346
that the sound's...

119
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,946
Haibara, do you know?

120
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,446
Who's DJ?

121
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,646
Where's this Edie P that they're talking about?

122
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,246
They mention about that just now!

123
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:30,046
It's a code or something, right?

124
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,946
Well...

125
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:33,946
I don't know who is DJ

126
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,746
but if Edie P is a place,

127
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:38,746
P probably stands for a parking lot or a park.

128
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:42,146
Then, do you know who Kir, Chianti and Korn are?

129
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,446
I don't remember Kir.

130
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,146
But I've heard of Chianti and Korn.

131
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:49,946
They're supposed to be competent snipers.

132
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:52,946
Which means that they're going to assassinate somebody after all.

133
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,646
Hey, what's going on?

134
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,846
Don't tell me that the two are there too?

135
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:59,146
Darn it, I don't have enough information.

136
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:00,846
I've to get closer!

137
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:05,046
The transmitter is 580 m northeast from here.

138
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,246
Probably at the basement parking of that building over there.

139
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,146
Haibara, wait here together with the Dr. Agasa!

140
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,646
Hey, just where do you think you're going?

141
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,746
Never mind that! Just wait here!

142
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,046
That's as far as you go.

143
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:51,846
Kudo!

144
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,046
Shinichi?

145
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:00,246
Hi!

146
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:04,246
Cool Kid.

147
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:07,420
at 1 pm in the afternoon today!

148
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,820
What?

149
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,420
How do you know?

150
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,320
The transmitter coincidentally got stuck to the sole of her shoe.

151
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,820
So I've been pursuing her with my pursuit glasses...

152
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,220
This is bad! It's coming closer!

153
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,120
-Get in! -What?

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Dr. Agasa, you too! Get in quickly!

155
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,820
Yeah.

156
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,220
Jodie here.

157
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,120
Our target is heading southward on Toriyakaido!

158
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
Please pursue.

159
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,620
Gin's car is taking a different route...

160
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,920
Are we pursuing them too?

161
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,820
No. All we'll end up doing just pursuing them blindly is go in circles.

162
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Besides, we're finished if they find out that we're tailing them

163
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,620
But we have to do something or someone's going to be killed, right?

164
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,620
In other words, we have no choice

165
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,220
but to figure out who DJ is

166
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,520
and figure out the place called Edie P

167
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,420
and get to both before they do.

168
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,720
Yeah.

169
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,420
So, will you tell me in detail

170
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,920
about the three people

171
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,720
that the announcer is scheduled to interview today?

172
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,820
The three people she'll be interviewing are

173
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,920
the candidates who are running for the House of Representatives

174
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,720
for the first time.

175
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,520
The first person is a professor

176
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,920
of the pharmaceutical department of Teito University,

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,820
who has researched and developed many new drugs, Eisaku Tokiwa.

178
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,320
The second person is a famous actor from a distinguished family.

179
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,920
Moreover, if he wins, he will be a second generation Dietman.

180
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,620
Junji Sendou.

181
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,420
The third person is the son of the former official of the Defense Agency,

182
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,720
who he himself served as a higher up in the Self Defense Force,

183
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,420
Yasuteru Domon.

184
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,620
But we weren't able to get information on what time,

185
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,920
where and who she would be interviewing.

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,520
We were told that it was all up to her and the TV crew.

187
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,820
Maybe she's going to be holding a no appointment interview.

188
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,820
If so, high chances that the TV crew is also one of them.

189
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,720
But all three of them do not have the initials DJ.

190
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
Eisaku Tokiwa is ET.

191
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,420
Junji Sendou is JS.

192
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,220
Yasuteru Domon is YD.

193
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,320
If we can at least figure out the place.

194
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,820
There are so many parking lots and parks.

195
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,120
DJ usually stands for Disc Jockey, doesn't it?

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
The etymology is disc...

197
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,420
In other words, records are changed one after the other

198
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,320
to play a variety of songs.

199
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,020
This was deemed analogous to one riding records,

200
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,420
that is, to a jockey who rides horses

201
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,920
We have no information that any of the three

202
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,520
is into music or hooked on gambling either.

203
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,620
Gambling?

204
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,920
What's on your mind?

205
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,520
It's about time that...

206
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,120
Gambling.

207
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,420
It's about time that we go after her

208
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,720
or we'll really lose track of her...

209
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,020
No. We're not pursuing her.

210
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,520
Let's call the election offices.

211
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,620
And ask what the candidate is scheduled to do around 13:00.

212
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,220
Don't tell me that you figured something out?

213
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah. One of the three is their target DJ!

214
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,320
The clue is the Jack of Diamonds.

215
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,120
The Jack of Diamonds?

216
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,520
Are you saying that's what DJ stands for?

217
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Yeah.

218
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,620
They always referred to their targets using playing cards!

219
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,720
If so, diamonds symbolize material possessions and financial wealth.

220
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,420
DJ is comes from a rich, distinguished family

221
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
and will become a second generation Dietman if elected...

222
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,320
He's Junji Sendou.

223
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
Wrong.

224
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,220
In playing cards, The Jack of Diamonds symbolizes

225
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,620
the one who serves the Court,

226
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,420
either a retainer or a soldier who has be appointed as an official.

227
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,820
It doesn't have the meaning of Prince or son.

228
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
What?

229
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,020
But...

230
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,620
He's the only rich one around.

231
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,220
It's true that diamonds symbolize money,

232
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,820
But in astrology it symbolizes other qualities.

233
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,120
In other words, a former self defense executive,

234
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
with a name that describes the character Earth in his name, which means

235
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,420
Yasuteru Domon.

236
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,520
He's their target!

237
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,620
Yasuteru Domon.

238
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,820
He has a strong sense of justice

239
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,320
and made repeated radical comments regarding violence

240
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,620
and crimes on TV and in the papers.

241
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,820
He also has a great number of supporters.

242
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,920
Therefore, he had snipers being sent out after him

243
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,020
by crime related organizations,

244
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,820
but he's a super tough guy who beat them all up instead.

245
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,420
It seems that he doesn't need us to protect him though.

246
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,120
No. The one who is after him is The Black Organization.

247
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,820
They can't be taken lightly.

248
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,720
I got it.

249
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,520
The telephone number to his election campaign office.

250
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,920
It says on the website that he is scheduled to play golf this afternoon

251
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,520
but it doesn't say where.

252
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,920
So, the parking lot of the golf range

253
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,820
is where Mr. Domon is going to be shot.

254
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,820
At any rate, I think it's fastest to call this office and ask.

255
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,220
Here.

256
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,020
Ms. Jodie, here's the number.

257
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,220
Okay!

258
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,420
There. Okay.

259
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
What?

260
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,520
No. I just thought you changed.

261
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,620
What?

262
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,220
Because when any of them were involved before,

263
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,420
"Stop it!"

264
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
"It's dangerous!"

265
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,220
"You'd better run!"

266
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,620
That's all you used to say!

267
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,120
Most naturally.

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,220
This time the transmitter and wiretap that you carelessly set up

269
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,920
is stuck on the sole of the shoe of one of the members.

270
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
If they find the devices,

271
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,720
not only you, but all the people around you,

272
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,820
in other words, all of us as well may be dunked into hot water.

273
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,220
That's true, but...

274
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,620
Besides...

275
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
I...

276
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,620
I'll go see him after all.

277
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,720
If I see the culprit close by, I may be able to recognize him.

278
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,220
No! I already explained to you that

279
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,320
if the culprit is not caught,

280
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,020
there's a possibility that you'll get into big trouble.

281
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,120
But...

282
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,020
Not only you,

283
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,520
but there is a possibility that all the people who helped you

284
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,320
will end up being their target.

285
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,520
I understand your feeling of wanting to punish evil.

286
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,420
But to hold yourself back,

287
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,720
endure and back off is also a type of courage.

288
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
But...

289
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,420
But I...

290
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,120
I don't want to run!

291
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,620
I can never win if I keep on running away!

292
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,120
Never!

293
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,820
Besides... What?
