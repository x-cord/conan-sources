1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,122
What?

2
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:06,323
What did you just say?

3
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:09,126
Are you serious, Shinichi?

4
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:12,429
Yeah. No doubt about it!

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,032
I found a member of the Black Organization

6
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,634
after a chain of unusually coincidental events!

7
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,906
This is bad. The movement of the transmitter's becoming faster!

8
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,908
She's using a car.

9
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,010
Dr. Agasa! Rush over here!

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,712
Come pick me up with your Beetle!

11
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:30,714
Make sure that Haibara doesn't find out about this.

12
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:32,616
What?

13
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,418
Okay...

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,022
And Shinichi.

15
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:42,326
Yeah. I'm at Haido-cho's...

16
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,008
You're not getting away!

17
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,212
Conan?

18
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:04,114
Did you find what you were looking for?

19
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,318
What? What's up?

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,721
Conan says that he coincidentally ran into Dr. Agasa

21
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:13,924
and they're heading off to Tropical Land from now.

22
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:17,127
Come off it... It's raining.

23
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,929
What's with those two?

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,032
I'll call you again when I'm ready to go home!

25
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,133
Hey, wait...

26
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,516
I see...

27
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,718
You coincidentally became acquainted with an announcer,

28
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:45,022
who asked you to take on a job and went to her condominium,

29
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,623
where for investigation purposes,

30
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:51,128
you used chewing gum to stick on a transmitter and wiretap to the wall.

31
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:53,830
But the chewing gum came off and stuck to the sole of her shoe.

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,933
And that woman, again for some reason,

33
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,735
coincidentally turns out to be one of them.

34
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,004
Is that right?

35
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,806
Hey, Dr. Agasa?

36
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,509
I thought I told you not to bring her along!

37
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:08,212
Well, but you see...

38
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:12,816
So? Are you sure that

39
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:16,320
the announcer called Rena Mizunashi is one of them?

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,424
Yeah. She was sending mail to the mail address of their boss.

41
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:24,828
She also addressed the one who called her after that as...

42
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:25,929
Gin!

43
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,030
So, you see!

44
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,335
But you're sure lucky.

45
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:34,605
You got a clue to who they are thanks to a string of coincidences.

46
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,306
Rather, it's just the opposite.

47
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,408
It's the opposite. Really bad.

48
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,910
Think about it carefully.

49
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,313
If the transmitter and wiretap are found by them,

50
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:46,416
they'll naturally try to figure out who set it up.

51
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,819
And, the first person to be suspected would be the one

52
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,522
who was at that announcer's place until just a while ago,

53
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,625
Detective Kogoro Mouri!

54
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,526
Hey, don't tell me that...

55
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,628
Yeah.

56
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:01,031
Even if Pops were to have set them up

57
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,935
to investigate the case she asked him to take on.

58
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,606
The chance that he may have heard their conversation cannot be denied.

59
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,109
If this happens, those guys would most likely...

60
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,911
Get to work trying to shut him up.

61
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:16,813
Not only Kogoro Mouri.

62
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:22,219
But if need be, every single person around him.

63
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,620
No way...

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,025
In other words, the more information comes through the transmitter,

65
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:33,230
the more the necks of both Pops and I are being choked.

66
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,033
Then, we have to retrieve them

67
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,235
as soon as possible before those guys find them.

68
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,604
But I just don't get it.

69
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:44,408
That announcer asked Detective Mouri

70
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:47,310
to nab the one who was ringing her doorbell and running away, right?

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,013
Moreover, the culprit turned out to be a kid.

72
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:52,816
If she were one of them, she would never...

73
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,917
Yeah.

74
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,119
That's the part that bugs me too.

75
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,323
The movement of the transmitter has slowed down.

76
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:13,003
Besides the sound of the engine is echoing.

77
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,205
Which means...

78
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,507
She went into an indoor parking lot somewhere.

79
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,212
Which means that she'll be meeting those guys in that building somewhere.

80
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,416
She's approaching something...

81
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,517
Is it a car?

82
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:36,326
This unique uneven sound of idling...

83
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,331
And...

84
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:45,902
The sound of the engine revving is that of a horizontally opposed engine.

85
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,304
Hey, don't tell me that...

86
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:48,605
Yeah...

87
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,607
The only cars equipped with this engine

88
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,009
are either Volkswagens, Subaru or...

89
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,611
that guy's beloved vehicle.

90
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,714
Porsche. That's all.

91
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,635
What's up, Kir?

92
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,404
You promised to be here at 10 am.

93
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,706
Gin!

94
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,207
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,510
A car seems to have been tailing me

96
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,712
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

97
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:31,014
Don't tell me that she's referring to our car?

98
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:37,421
No, because we kept more than 600 m away from her car.

99
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,022
It couldn't be us.

100
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:43,226
Are you sure you're not in trouble?

101
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,729
Yes. I was just being too overly concerned.

102
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,533
So, will you put that Beretta that you're aiming out the window

103
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,235
back into it's case?

104
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,905
If you shoot me because you don't trust me...

105
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,307
You won't be able to kill DJ, right?

106
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,710
DJ...

107
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,712
What does that mean?

108
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,514
Okay.

109
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:09,419
We have 500 m of all the four directions of this building covered.

110
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,721
If an unwanted car approaches,

111
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,024
we'll know right of the bat.

112
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,127
Dr. Agasa.

113
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,229
Will you pull the car over slowly to the shoulder of the road.

114
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,230
What?

115
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,933
After stopping wear your hood and go outside.

116
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,935
Then, pretend that you're checking the car.

117
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,403
Quick!

118
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:27,504
Okay.

119
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,818
Here goes the final confirmation.

120
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,420
Go ahead.

121
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,822
Time is 13:00.

122
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,625
Place is Edie P...

123
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:53,930
I, as the interviewer, will guide DJ to the designated place.

124
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,131
Yes...

125
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,834
We'll be waiting for you, Kir.

126
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,904
Shove the prey right into the center of my scope

127
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:05,008
and excite me.

128
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,511
My, Chianti...

129
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,212
Korn's with you too, isn't he?

130
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,415
How encouraging.

131
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,218
Kir, Chianti, Korn.

132
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,721
How many of them are they, anyway?

133
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:20,123
I'm counting on you all.

134
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:23,527
Our achievements will never see the light.

135
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:27,631
But when we fail, the word goes around really quickly.

136
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:33,503
Whether we succeed or not, nobody will know about it.

137
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:36,006
That's how the organization works.

138
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,608
Yeah. That's right.

139
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,211
Okay. It's almost time.

140
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,013
Hurry and finish what you have to.

141
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:47,117
Will you work it out

142
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:49,119
so that I don't have to do anything?

143
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,221
Vermouth!

144
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,422
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

145
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,723
How come?

146
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,625
Why is this lady here?

147
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,127
Nobody told me!

148
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:00,530
How come this lady who took Calvados out on his own and left him to die

149
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,732
is included in this project!

150
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,535
Go back to the car, Chianti.

151
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:09,406
We're keeping her here just in case.

152
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,409
But...

153
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,313
This is his order too, you know?

154
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,222
The place is Edie P.

155
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:32,028
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

156
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,029
What?

157
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,831
What do you mean by that?

158
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,904
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

159
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:42,906
Yeah.

160
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,309
What's more of a problem is the rain.

161
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,911
Don't worry.

162
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:51,014
It'll clear up before noon. The weather forecast...

163
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,518
Darn it! It's raining so hard

164
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,120
that the sound's...

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,722
Haibara, do you know?

166
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,223
Who's DJ?

167
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,426
Where's this Edie P that they're talking about?

168
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,028
They mention about that just now!

169
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,830
It's a code or something, right?

170
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,732
Well...

171
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:10,734
I don't know who is DJ

172
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,535
but if Edie P is a place,

173
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,505
P probably stands for a parking lot or a park.

174
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:18,908
Then, do you know who Kir, Chianti and Korn are?

175
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,211
I don't remember Kir.

176
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,913
But I've heard of Chianti and Korn.

177
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,716
They're supposed to be competent snipers.

178
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,719
Which means that they're going to assassinate somebody after all.

179
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,421
Hey, what's going on?

180
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,623
Don't tell me that the two are there too?

181
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,925
Darn it, I don't have enough information.

182
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,627
I've to get closer!

183
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:41,831
The transmitter is 580 m northeast from here.

184
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,006
Probably at the basement parking of that building over there.

185
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,910
Haibara, wait here together with the Dr. Agasa!

186
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,412
Hey, just where do you think you're going?

187
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:56,513
Never mind that! Just wait here!

188
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,819
That's as far as you go.

189
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:13,705
Kudo!

190
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:14,906
Shinichi?

191
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,080
Hi!

192
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:26,084
Cool Kid.

193
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:37,195
Ms. Jodie?

194
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:39,798
Hi!

195
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,902
What brings you here?

196
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:48,206
We, FBI agents, have been tailing her.

197
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:52,077
Ever since Vermouth disguised as Dr. Araide,

198
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,479
that announcer, Rena Mizunashi,

199
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:58,183
has been frequenting his clinic.

200
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,885
But it really shocked me,

201
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,887
when we were staking her out and...

202
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:07,392
Detective Mouri went into her place.

203
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,494
Then...

204
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:15,901
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

205
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:19,705
That was...

206
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,407
Yes! That was me!

207
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:25,177
And I found out that she had asked Kogoro

208
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,079
to investigate the prank that was being played by the child.

209
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,680
Just when I thought she was innocent

210
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,383
and about to quit staking her out...

211
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,588
I saw you running with a dreadfully serious look on your face.

212
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:37,689
Cool kid?

213
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:42,394
I figured there had to be something going on.

214
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,498
So, I continued to pursue her.

215
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:53,505
I knew she was trying to throw me off track,

216
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,309
so I didn't gone all the way and dropped pursuing her altogether.

217
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:58,477
I see.

218
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,278
So the car she was referring to was...

219
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,182
A car seems to have been tailing me

221
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,984
so I was trying to throw it off track, just in case.

222
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:09,988
The car she was talking about was Ms. Jodie's car.

223
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,593
You people lost track of her car too, didn't you?

224
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:18,296
Leave the rest to the F.B.I and go on home!

225
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:21,400
"You", you said? Do you mean you have a clue?

226
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,602
I can't give you the details,

227
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:27,506
but it seems she going to be interviewing three people today.

228
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:30,409
I'm thinking that maybe there is a person among the three,

229
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,978
who's being manipulated by them

230
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:34,479
and that some sort of transaction

231
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,282
or information exchange will be carried out.

232
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:39,384
No, it's no transaction!

233
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,686
Those guys are planning to kill one of the three

234
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:44,189
at 1 pm in the afternoon today!

235
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,590
What?

236
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,192
How do you know?

237
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:51,096
The transmitter coincidentally got stuck to the sole of her shoe.

238
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:54,599
So I've been pursuing her with my pursuit glasses...

239
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,002
This is bad! It's coming closer!

240
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,904
-Get in! -What?

241
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,105
Dr. Agasa, you too! Get in quickly!

242
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:01,606
Yeah.

243
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,981
Jodie here.

244
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,884
Our target is heading southward on Toriyakaido!

245
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,085
Please pursue.

246
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:18,390
Gin's car is taking a different route...

247
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,692
Are we pursuing them too?

248
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:25,597
No. All we'll end up doing just pursuing them blindly is go in circles.

249
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,600
Besides, we're finished if they find out that we're tailing them

250
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,405
But we have to do something or someone's going to be killed, right?

251
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:36,408
In other words, we have no choice

252
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,009
but to figure out who DJ is

253
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,277
and figure out the place called Edie P

254
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,180
and get to both before they do.

255
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,482
Yeah.

256
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,183
So, will you tell me in detail

257
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:47,686
about the three people

258
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:50,489
that the announcer is scheduled to interview today?

259
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,591
The three people she'll be interviewing are

260
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:54,693
the candidates who are running for the House of Representatives

261
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,495
for the first time.

262
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,296
The first person is a professor

263
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,698
of the pharmaceutical department of Teito University,

264
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:04,603
who has researched and developed many new drugs, Eisaku Tokiwa.

265
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:08,106
The second person is a famous actor from a distinguished family.

266
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:10,709
Moreover, if he wins, he will be a second generation Dietman.

267
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,377
Junji Sendou.

268
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:16,181
The third person is the son of the former official of the Defense Agency,

269
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:18,483
who he himself served as a higher up in the Self Defense Force,

270
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,185
Yasuteru Domon.

271
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:22,387
But we weren't able to get information on what time,

272
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:26,691
where and who she would be interviewing.

273
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:30,295
We were told that it was all up to her and the TV crew.

274
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,598
Maybe she's going to be holding a no appointment interview.

275
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:38,603
If so, high chances that the TV crew is also one of them.

276
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:43,508
But all three of them do not have the initials DJ.

277
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,678
Eisaku Tokiwa is ET.

278
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,181
Junji Sendou is JS.

279
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,985
Yasuteru Domon is YD.

280
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:57,088
If we can at least figure out the place.

281
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:00,592
There are so many parking lots and parks.

282
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:04,896
DJ usually stands for Disc Jockey, doesn't it?

283
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:06,698
The etymology is disc...

284
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,201
In other words, records are changed one after the other

285
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,102
to play a variety of songs.

286
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,804
This was deemed analogous to one riding records,

287
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:17,208
that is, to a jockey who rides horses

288
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,677
We have no information that any of the three

289
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:23,281
is into music or hooked on gambling either.

290
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:26,384
Gambling?

291
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,686
What's on your mind?

292
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,287
It's about time that...

293
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,889
Gambling.

294
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,192
It's about time that we go after her

295
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:37,495
or we'll really lose track of her...

296
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:40,799
No. We're not pursuing her.

297
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,302
Let's call the election offices.

298
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:47,405
And ask what the candidate is scheduled to do around 13:00.

299
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,008
Don't tell me that you figured something out?

300
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:56,581
Yeah. One of the three is their target DJ!

301
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,084
The clue is the Jack of Diamonds.

302
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,885
The Jack of Diamonds?

303
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,291
Are you saying that's what DJ stands for?

304
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,292
Yeah.

305
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:14,399
They always referred to their targets using playing cards!

306
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,503
If so, diamonds symbolize material possessions and financial wealth.

307
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,206
DJ is comes from a rich, distinguished family

308
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,208
and will become a second generation Dietman if elected...

309
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,076
He's Junji Sendou.

310
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,278
Wrong.

311
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,979
In playing cards, The Jack of Diamonds symbolizes

312
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,381
the one who serves the Court,

313
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:32,183
either a retainer or a soldier who has be appointed as an official.

314
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,586
It doesn't have the meaning of Prince or son.

315
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:35,587
What?

316
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:36,788
But...

317
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,391
He's the only rich one around.

318
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:41,993
It's true that diamonds symbolize money,

319
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,597
But in astrology it symbolizes other qualities.

320
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:48,900
In other words, a former self defense executive,

321
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,903
with a name that describes the character Earth in his name, which means

322
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:54,205
Yasuteru Domon.

323
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,308
He's their target!

324
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:59,377
Yasuteru Domon.

325
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:01,579
He has a strong sense of justice

326
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,082
and made repeated radical comments regarding violence

327
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:06,384
and crimes on TV and in the papers.

328
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:08,586
He also has a great number of supporters.

329
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:11,690
Therefore, he had snipers being sent out after him

330
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,792
by crime related organizations,

331
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:17,595
but he's a super tough guy who beat them all up instead.

332
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:22,200
It seems that he doesn't need us to protect him though.

333
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,904
No. The one who is after him is The Black Organization.

334
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:27,605
They can't be taken lightly.

335
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:30,508
I got it.

336
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,278
The telephone number to his election campaign office.

337
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:37,682
It says on the website that he is scheduled to play golf this afternoon

338
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,285
but it doesn't say where.

339
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:42,687
So, the parking lot of the golf range

340
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,590
is where Mr. Domon is going to be shot.

341
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,594
At any rate, I think it's fastest to call this office and ask.

342
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,996
Here.

343
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,799
Ms. Jodie, here's the number.

344
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay!

345
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:00,205
There. Okay.

346
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,277
What?

347
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:10,281
No. I just thought you changed.

348
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:11,382
What?

349
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,985
Because when any of them were involved before,

350
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:15,186
"Stop it!"

351
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,187
"It's dangerous!"

352
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,989
"You'd better run!"

353
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:20,391
That's all you used to say!

354
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,893
Most naturally.

355
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:25,997
This time the transmitter and wiretap that you carelessly set up

356
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:30,702
is stuck on the sole of the shoe of one of the members.

357
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:32,303
If they find the devices,

358
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,506
not only you, but all the people around you,

359
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,609
in other words, all of us as well may be dunked into hot water.

360
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,978
That's true, but...

361
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:42,380
Besides...

362
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,581
I...

363
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:48,386
I'll go see him after all.

364
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:51,489
If I see the culprit close by, I may be able to recognize him.

365
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:53,992
No! I already explained to you that

366
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,094
if the culprit is not caught,

367
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,797
there's a possibility that you'll get into big trouble.

368
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,899
But...

369
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:02,801
Not only you,

370
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:05,303
but there is a possibility that all the people who helped you

371
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:08,106
will end up being their target.

372
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,277
I understand your feeling of wanting to punish evil.

373
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,179
But to hold yourself back,

374
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,482
endure and back off is also a type of courage.

375
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,484
But...

376
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,186
But I...

377
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:22,887
I don't want to run!

378
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,391
I can never win if I keep on running away!

379
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,892
Never!

380
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,598
Besides... What?
