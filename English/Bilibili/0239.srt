1
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.040
Even destiny serves as a clue to the deduction.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.040
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.840
Today, the case gets resolved.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.740
Will Conan catch the killer?

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.253 --> 00:02:00.253
Upon Heiji Hattori's request,

9
00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:04.253
we came to Osaka to attend a restaurant's opening party.

10
00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:08.453
Three men own the restaurant,

11
00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:10.953
a former professional boxer named Ricardo Balera,

12
00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:14.053
Major League pitcher Mike Norwood

13
00:02:15.253 --> 00:02:18.253
and professional soccer player Ray Curtis.

14
00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:23.353
But while we were in the midst of helping them with their secret plan,

15
00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:25.253
a gunshot ring out.

16
00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:29.953
When we ran into the room where the gunshot came from,

17
00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:33.053
we found that an American newspaper reporter named Ed McKay

18
00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:34.453
had been shot to death.

19
00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:43.453
"The 3K's Incident in Osaka (Part 2)"

20
00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:49.053
Gosh, thanks to this murder, the party's ruined.

21
00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:53.453
The lottery for the autographed souvenirs was called off too.

22
00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:56.953
Ran, you were lucky you got yours before this happened.

23
00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:01.053
Hey? I just noticed,

24
00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:03.053
where did Conan and Heiji go?

25
00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:06.753
They're probably sticking close to Otaki

26
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.153
helping with the case.

27
00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:11.653
Helping with the case?

28
00:03:11.653 --> 00:03:13.453
For goodness sakes.

29
00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:16.553
You don't have to worry so much, they'll be fine.

30
00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:18.453
The murder weapon's already been found,

31
00:03:18.453 --> 00:03:20.753
the murderer will be caught in no time.

32
00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:21.753
I wonder.

33
00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.353
It's just a matter of time.

34
00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:27.053
After all, Heiji Hattori's hot on the case.

35
00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:28.253
Yes, I suppose.

36
00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:33.053
Since the hotel's not open yet,

37
00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:36.053
the elevators weren't operating.

38
00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:37.153
Which means...

39
00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:39.153
those three guys

40
00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:41.753
could only use these stairs to get to each floor.

41
00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.053
All the rooms are set up the same

42
00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:54.753
and the light switches are all in this spot.

43
00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:57.953
And there wasn't any sign that the wiring was rigged in any way.

44
00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:04.553
And it seems like the only way to turn the lights on and off

45
00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:07.353
is to press the switch.

46
00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:10.753
Wait a minute.

47
00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:13.953
I'm sure Mike said he opened the curtains.

48
00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:19.053
If he tied a string to the edge of the curtain

49
00:04:19.053 --> 00:04:22.053
and rigged it so it would open when the string was pulled

50
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.053
he could've opened the curtains while being somewhere else.

51
00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:25.753
I don't think so.

52
00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:32.153
I checked the room Mike worked on, first thing

53
00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:36.053
but I didn't find any trace that string had been tied to the curtain

54
00:04:36.053 --> 00:04:39.653
or any scratch marks left from the string being pulled.

55
00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:44.853
Out of the three, Ray was in the room closest to the scene of the murder

56
00:04:44.853 --> 00:04:48.053
but it would have taken 10 seconds for him to run up the stairs

57
00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:51.253
and get to that room after turning the lights on.

58
00:04:51.253 --> 00:04:54.453
Ray suffers from a chronic articular ailment in his left knee

59
00:04:54.453 --> 00:04:58.153
for it's pretty much impossible for him to have done it.

60
00:04:58.153 --> 00:05:00.453
And for your information, Mike's injured his Achilles tendon

61
00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:02.353
and is undergoing rehabilitation.

62
00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:05.253
And Ricardo has always been a slow runner.

63
00:05:05.253 --> 00:05:08.753
None of the three could have committed the crime in that time span.

64
00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:12.353
You know, Kudo?

65
00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:13.953
You're acting strange.

66
00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:16.353
Any other time,

67
00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:18.753
if the witnesses to a crime had shaky alibis like these guys,

68
00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:21.853
you'd have been the first to suspect them!

69
00:05:21.853 --> 00:05:22.953
You think so?

70
00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:25.853
Well, even if they could've made it to the room,

71
00:05:25.853 --> 00:05:28.753
they'd have to knock on the door and by the time the victim let them in,

72
00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:30.753
that would take another five seconds.

73
00:05:30.753 --> 00:05:32.953
No matter how you look at it, it's impossible!

74
00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:34.853
Hey, Kudo, what is that?

75
00:05:34.853 --> 00:05:37.553
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:38.853
It's just a mop, isn't it?

77
00:05:38.853 --> 00:05:41.353
A mop in a hotel's guest room?

78
00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:43.753
You're right, it is out of place.

79
00:05:48.153 --> 00:05:51.353
Hey, Kudo, you think it's possible?

80
00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:53.153
The other two might not be able to do it

81
00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:55.553
but if he used what he always does,

82
00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:58.453
he could operate the switches from far away.

83
00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:01.453
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:04.853
He didn't have it on him and it wasn't in the room.

85
00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:07.253
That's what I want to ask you.

86
00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:10.153
It's such a small thing, you can hide it just about anywhere.

87
00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:11.253
That's ridiculous!

88
00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:12.853
It's absolutely impossible!

89
00:06:12.853 --> 00:06:15.653
And I'll prove it, just you wait!

90
00:06:19.453 --> 00:06:23.253
Kudo, weren't you the one who said...

91
00:06:24.653 --> 00:06:28.253
remove what can't be done and whatever remains,

92
00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:30.753
no matter how unthinkable

93
00:06:30.753 --> 00:06:33.953
that will be the truth.

94
00:06:33.953 --> 00:06:36.753
Isn't that what you said, Kudo?

95
00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:44.653
Are you all right?

96
00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:47.953
Yeah, this old injury still bothers me.

97
00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:49.753
Don't push yourself so much.

98
00:06:49.753 --> 00:06:52.453
Don't worry about me, the pain eases up when I take my medicine.

99
00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:54.253
Take it easy.

100
00:06:54.253 --> 00:06:55.653
If "The Steel Barrier" falls to its knees,

101
00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:57.153
that'll be the end of the game!

102
00:06:57.153 --> 00:06:59.653
I know, let's go out for a drink later to forget this mess!

103
00:07:12.153 --> 00:07:14.053
This is a...

104
00:07:15.953 --> 00:07:20.253
I'm sure about it this time!

105
00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:23.953
I heard it in some restaurant once.

106
00:07:23.953 --> 00:07:27.353
Be careful, Ran. It's probably some bad joke.

107
00:07:27.353 --> 00:07:31.853
It's the truth! The person working there was shouting,

108
00:07:31.853 --> 00:07:35.053
I heard the words "band" and "wooden sandals"!

109
00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:39.653
That reporter Ed was speaking fluent Japanese

110
00:07:39.653 --> 00:07:41.153
and he knew a lot about Japan!

111
00:07:41.153 --> 00:07:43.053
I know it had something to do with a tempura restaurant

112
00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:47.153
or a sushi restaurant or a sukiyaki restaurant, one of those.

113
00:07:48.453 --> 00:07:50.353
I see.

114
00:07:50.353 --> 00:07:51.853
Now, I get it.

115
00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.653
Darn it.

116
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:05.961
What?

117
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:08.561
What's this deflated soccer ball doing here?

118
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:10.461
That means there was an extra one.

119
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:12.561
Maybe it's a spare?

120
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.761
You think so?

121
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.961
Detective, can we leave already?

122
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:21.661
Those two said they'd like to go back to the hotel and take a shower.

123
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:23.661
Well, but...

124
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.461
It shouldn't be a problem, Otaki.

125
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:29.961
You didn't find any gun powder residue on them, did you?

126
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:31.661
But still, Heiji.

127
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.561
In exchange...

128
00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:37.961
I'd like you to do me a favor.

129
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:43.761
A favor?

130
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:47.361
That's right, Ray.

131
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.361
A favor from you.

132
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:50.861
Me?

133
00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:57.961
There's someone waiting that I want you to meet

134
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.961
in the room you were just in at the hotel.

135
00:09:01.961 --> 00:09:03.961
I really appreciate it.

136
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.561
Because that person is a great fan of yours.

137
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:10.661
Oh, my gosh!

138
00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:15.961
Who on earth did this?

139
00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:19.261
-That's right. -What?

140
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.161
It's a very simple set-up.

141
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.461
First, you leave the door wide open

142
00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:27.761
until the door to the hotel room is locked,

143
00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:31.661
then remove the closet's sliding door and take the mop out.

144
00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:35.661
The sliding door is propped up in the position

145
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:37.961
the light switch will be when it's turned on,

146
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:42.161
the tip of the mop handle is placed in between the sliding door

147
00:09:42.161 --> 00:09:43.561
and the switch and the sliding door is lifted up,

148
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:45.661
there, the set-up is ready!

149
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:48.061
All that's left to do is, take the soccer ball you've prepared

150
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.261
and kick it down the stairs.

151
00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:07.261
If the curtains in the room were already left open,

152
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:09.461
from out the view outside,

153
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:13.461
it would've looked like you had turned the lights on.

154
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:18.061
Isn't that right?

155
00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:20.361
Ray.

156
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.061
After just a couple of trial runs,

157
00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:28.661
even a kid like me managed to do it.

158
00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.861
During your career as a mid-fielder,

159
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:34.261
you, Ray Curtis was known for your scoring goals on free kicks

160
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:37.461
I bet you could do this with your eyes closed.

161
00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:42.561
That's right. With this method,

162
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:45.961
you can turn the lights on the first floor on from the second floor

163
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:47.461
and at almost the same time,

164
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:52.261
kill the reporter in the room on the second floor,

165
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:57.261
and claim you were on the first floor all the time.

166
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:00.461
No way, kid. This is some bad joke.

167
00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:03.561
Let me explain, your plan went something like this.

168
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:07.061
The lights you were supposed to turn on,

169
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:10.061
the 5 on the lower second row of the letter K.

170
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:13.761
You set this up in the room scheduled to be lit up second,

171
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:16.461
the right end of the first row.

172
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:21.361
Which is this room in front of the stairs.

173
00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:26.561
After you turned on the first light,

174
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.461
you went to the second room,

175
00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:30.961
set things up

176
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:35.261
and went upstairs with the gun you'd had hidden and the soccer ball.

177
00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.561
Then turned on the lights on

178
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:40.461
in the third, fourth and fifth rooms on the second floor.

179
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:44.861
Of course, you deliberately didn't turn the lights on in the second room.

180
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:49.361
And then, knowing Ran was outside watching,

181
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.961
you brought it to her attention and told her

182
00:11:52.961 --> 00:11:56.761
that you were heading there at that time,

183
00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:59.661
then you kicked the ball down the stairs

184
00:11:59.661 --> 00:12:01.861
which turned the light on in the room.

185
00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:08.561
Then you rushed to the room Ed was waiting in, shot him.

186
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.561
Tossed the gun away...

187
00:12:12.561 --> 00:12:16.661
and ran back downstairs into the room, looked out the window

188
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:19.761
and pretended to be surprised by the gunshot

189
00:12:19.761 --> 00:12:23.961
giving us the impression, you were there all along.

190
00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:28.161
Have I missed something, Ray?

191
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:30.961
That's very, very good.

192
00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:34.761
But you know, kid? You've forgotten one thing.

193
00:12:34.761 --> 00:12:36.161
Ran said so herself,

194
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.261
barely three seconds had passed before the light went on

195
00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:41.061
and the gunshot was heard.

196
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.661
It would've been impossible for me to do what you said

197
00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.961
in such a short time.

198
00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:48.561
It would take more than 3 seconds to kick the ball,

199
00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:51.961
knock on Ed's door and wait for him to come out.

200
00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:56.561
You probably knocked on the door then kicked the ball, didn't you?

201
00:12:57.261 --> 00:12:59.061
After you knocked on his door,

202
00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:00.461
you went to the stairs

203
00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:03.161
and kicked the ball the same time he opened the door.

204
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:06.461
As you walked up to him, you spoke into the transceiver,

205
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.961
confirmed the light had been turned out then shot him,

206
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:12.961
in this order, three seconds is more than enough time.

207
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:14.561
For your information,

208
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.761
if you were to tie a string to that mop then pull it

209
00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:18.761
you could also turn the light off,

210
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.061
which means Ricardo, who said he was turning the light off

211
00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:23.861
on the fifth floor could also have done it,

212
00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:26.161
however the scene of the murder

213
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:29.261
was on the second floor, which you were in charge of.

214
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:31.461
It wouldn't have been possible for him to have committed the murder

215
00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:33.261
without running into you.

216
00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:35.661
The same goes for Mike

217
00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:37.561
who was opening the curtains on the third floor.

218
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:39.761
That means...

219
00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:43.661
Ray, you're the only one

220
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:45.661
who could have committed the murder.

221
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:49.661
But kid, I shot the gun, I should have powder residue on me.

222
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.261
When the police do the test,

223
00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:55.461
they only check the area around the cuffs of the sleeve

224
00:13:55.461 --> 00:13:57.061
and maybe the pants.

225
00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:01.361
They never check the inside of the clothes.

226
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:04.161
If you took your jacket off

227
00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:07.361
and turned your shirt and pants inside out before firing the gun,

228
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:10.161
then put your jacket back on before looking out the window

229
00:14:10.161 --> 00:14:13.461
and while you were waiting in the room, fixed your pants and shirt,

230
00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.961
you wouldn't test positive.

231
00:14:17.461 --> 00:14:21.961
Isn't the when you used this needle to deflate the ball

232
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.961
and hit it in your shirt?

233
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:27.561
I went into the toilet right after you came out

234
00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:29.861
and found it in the trash bin,

235
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:32.661
and there was also an extra ball

236
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:35.661
under the souvenir table in the party hall, it was deflated.

237
00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:38.761
But you can't prove I put it there.

238
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:44.861
It's Ed, he's telling us you did it.

239
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:49.261
The position of Ed's finger on his right hand,

240
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:51.661
it's in a sushi eating form

241
00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:55.261
the left hand clutching the belt refers to the band.

242
00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:56.461
In sushi restaurants,

243
00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:59.861
the employees use a code of symbols only they understand.

244
00:14:59.861 --> 00:15:04.361
One of the symbols is "band" for the number 8.

245
00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:12.461
He was indicating Ray Curtis whose number is 8, was his killer.

246
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:15.261
It was his dying message!

247
00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:23.161
I forgot to mention, the towel in the bathroom was wet.

248
00:15:24.161 --> 00:15:27.961
You washed your face and hands, didn't you?

249
00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:32.661
I guess you knew gun powder residue on the skin washed off easily.

250
00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:40.461
It's so ironic.

251
00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:45.761
I set off to prove you were innocent but the more I looked into it

252
00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:50.061
I found more and more evidence against you.

253
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:53.161
Well, kid. I hate to disappoint you,

254
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:57.161
but the evidence you mentioned, you can't pin anything on me,

255
00:15:58.061 --> 00:15:59.661
this shirt as well as these pants,

256
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:02.961
they're spare clothes I had my agent hang on to for me.

257
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.361
I changed them just now because I perspired so much.

258
00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:08.461
And since my agent took the other set back,

259
00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:11.161
they should be in the hotel laundry by now.

260
00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:13.461
What about your shoes?

261
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:16.461
My shoes?

262
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:19.761
If the gun's an automatic, when the cartridge...

263
00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:24.161
Gunshot flies out, some powder does, too.

264
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:26.961
In the case of gunshot a revolver,

265
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:30.461
it flies out radially, the barrel being the center point.

266
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.361
And of course, it'll fall onto the shoes, too.

267
00:16:36.361 --> 00:16:40.661
Ray, you were wearing shoes when you shot him, weren't you?

268
00:16:40.661 --> 00:16:44.261
After all, you had to make sure you kicked the ball accurately.

269
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:48.761
If you haven't changed them, it should show powder residue.

270
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:51.461
I believe that would be solid proof.

271
00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:57.461
Turn yourself in.

272
00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:03.261
I'm asking you to turn yourself in, Ray.

273
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:06.761
Please.

274
00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:13.761
Sorry, kid. I'm not going to do that.

275
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:17.561
If I'm arrested, my fans and my family

276
00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:20.461
will be very sad.

277
00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:24.161
Thanks for the warning, I'll go polish my shoes now.

278
00:17:24.161 --> 00:17:26.461
So that I have an excuse for the police.

279
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.461
Wait!

280
00:17:31.061 --> 00:17:34.361
That's not the only thing you have to explain.

281
00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:37.461
Isn't that right, Europe's steel stronghold?

282
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:40.861
Ray Curtis!

283
00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:01.361
What's the matter?

284
00:18:02.361 --> 00:18:04.061
What's the matter, Ray?

285
00:18:05.061 --> 00:18:09.361
That's the kind of shot they teach in high school.

286
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.261
You should've been able to stop that with one arm.

287
00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:17.161
What's the matter with you?

288
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.361
Come on, answer me.

289
00:18:19.361 --> 00:18:21.061
Answer me, Ray!

290
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.361
So when'd you figure it out

291
00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:32.361
that my body was being eaten away by drugs, kid?

292
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.961
Yawning and pain in the joints

293
00:18:34.961 --> 00:18:38.561
are signs of drug withdrawal.

294
00:18:38.561 --> 00:18:41.261
When you came out of the toilet

295
00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:45.561
holding your right knee instead of the left which you'd injured long ago,

296
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:47.561
that's when I figured it out.

297
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.561
The reason addicts don't stop using drugs

298
00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:52.361
is partly because of the euphoria

299
00:18:52.361 --> 00:18:55.861
and also because they can't stand the pain in their muscles and joints

300
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:58.161
when they do into withdrawal.

301
00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:04.461
Like the newspaper article said, your so-called super plays were...

302
00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:07.161
No, you're wrong!

303
00:19:07.161 --> 00:19:12.061
I started using drugs after that.

304
00:19:13.061 --> 00:19:14.961
Everything he wrote was a lie

305
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:17.261
but it caused my wife to commit suicide

306
00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:20.361
so I came up with a plan to get back at Ed.

307
00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:24.261
I fueled his suspicions and lured him here to Japan

308
00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:28.261
because this is where my wife was born and raised.

309
00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:31.161
Under an alias name, I told him to meet me in Japan

310
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:33.761
and I'd sell him information about Ray's drug addiction.

311
00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:38.161
Then, to forget the grief I felt over losing my wife Keiko,

312
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:41.561
who I loved more than anything. I had to...

313
00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:45.761
I had to rely on drugs, it was the only way.

314
00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:48.261
Stop.

315
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:50.361
Stop it, Ray.

316
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:55.461
Even if you were facing a bitter aspect of your life,

317
00:19:55.461 --> 00:20:00.261
you have no excuse to resort to drugs and murder, that's foul play.

318
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:03.561
You deserve a red card, you're a loser.

319
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:13.661
You're right. I don't belong on the field anymore.

320
00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:17.661
I'll step down from my position.

321
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.061
For both my late wife...

322
00:20:23.861 --> 00:20:26.161
and for my fans, like you.

323
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:37.761
After that, Ray turned himself in to the Osaka Prefecture Police.

324
00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:45.561
Goal keeper, uniform number 8 left the field, never to return again.

325
00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:27.861
"Hattori's Home"

326
00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:36.961
Are you serious?

327
00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:39.561
Did he really say he wasn't going to the game in Nagai?

328
00:22:40.461 --> 00:22:43.161
But he was looking forward to it so much.

329
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:47.161
Do you think it's because Ray's not going to be playing?

330
00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:51.961
No way, there's going to be so many other great players in that game.

331
00:22:51.961 --> 00:22:53.961
So why then?

332
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:55.261
Beats me.

333
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:58.261
If Conan's anything like Shinichi,

334
00:22:58.261 --> 00:22:59.961
we've got a lot to worry about though.

335
00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:02.261
That Shinichi, he might like something a whole lot

336
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:03.761
but if he finds something the least bit wrong,

337
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:05.261
he'll do a complete turnaround and hate that thing,

338
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:07.761
he's a little childish in that way.

339
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:11.361
Maybe Conan's the same and he'll start to hate soccer.

340
00:23:17.761 --> 00:23:19.761
I don't know what everybody likes about this game.

341
00:23:19.761 --> 00:23:21.961
All you do is kick the ball!

342
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:30.261
You're lousy.

343
00:23:30.261 --> 00:23:32.161
What'd you say?

344
00:23:33.561 --> 00:23:35.561
This is how you do it!

345
00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:51.761
It looks like you had nothing to worry about, Ran.

346
00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:55.761
They look like real brothers, don't they?

347
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:57.061
They sure do.

348
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.761
"Next episode" -What?

349
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:10.061
It looks like something happened.

350
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:14.061
"Bomb inside. Do not touch."

351
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:16.361
A prisoner's being transported?

352
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:25.961
Something's wrong.

353
