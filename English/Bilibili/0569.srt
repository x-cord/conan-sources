1
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,999
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Shiratori at the movie theater

2
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,199
and heard of his memory

3
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,099
of a fateful encounter with a girl during his childhood,

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,599
who he thought was Officer Sato,

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,099
that triggered his desire to become a police officer.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,599
The woman that

7
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:19,099
"Nami Kasakura (27)" -he gets to know at the theater

8
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,699
named Ms. Nami Kasakura,

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,699
like the girl in his memory,

10
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,199
decorated the cup of coke with a strip of paper flower

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,999
that she made out of the wrapper of a straw.

12
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:31,599
Could it be that Nami is the girl in his memory?

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,699
Hearing that Nami was troubled by a stalker,

14
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:39,699
we went to visit her condo along with Inspector Shiratori,

15
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,299
and found her boyfriend Mr. Yoshiro Somei,

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,899
killed by someone and lying dead.

17
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,099
Did the stalker commit the crime?

18
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:52,399
Or did Nami commit the crime

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,799
making it look like the work of a stalker?

20
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,699
But, her alibi was proven by none other than

21
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:00,799
Inspector Shiratori and ourselves.

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,099
If she is the one who did it,

23
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:05,599
what kind of trick did she use to commit the crime?

24
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,399
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

25
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:12,199
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

26
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,199
Encounter and goodbye,

27
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,399
the season of cherry blossoms.

28
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,599
Inspector Shiratori is about to fall in love.

29
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,299
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,299
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,199
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,879
"Inspector Shiratori Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 2)".

33
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,179
We verified Ms. Kasakura's alibi,

34
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,779
and although we looked inside the room,

35
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:23,379
no wiretap or camera was found.

36
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:27,079
No traces of a stalker having been in the room were found, but...

37
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,179
Takagi is speaking.

38
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,479
Did you find anything?

39
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,879
Well, the thing is,

40
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,779
there seems to have been quite a lot of people who left the theater

41
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,479
during the movie to go to the restroom.

42
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,279
Nobody seems to remember who went in and out.

43
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,479
Today is Sunday and it's really crowded,

44
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,079
so I think that's to be expected.

45
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,379
I see.

46
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,879
-Takagi. -Hey.

47
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,979
There's a trash can on that floor, isn't there?

48
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,179
Yes, although they're about to dispose of what's inside right now.

49
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,779
Then, go tell them that you're a police officer

50
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,079
and retrieve it, won't you?

51
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,179
There should be a cup that is wrapped with

52
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,279
a strip of paper shaped in flowers made of the wrapper of a straw

53
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,479
inside the trash.

54
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,079
A strip of paper flowers made out of the wrapper of a straw?

55
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,979
I found it!

56
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,179
Will you take that to forensics?

57
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,479
Just to be safe,

58
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,179
take the other cups inside the bag together with it too.

59
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,979
Check the fingerprints on the cup

60
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,779
and substance inside the drink of the cup.

61
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,079
-Yes, sir. -And...

62
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,579
And?

63
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,779
And...

64
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,379
No, that'll be all.

65
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,879
Let me know as soon as you get the results.

66
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,179
I'm sorry that I asked him to do things for me without asking you first.

67
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,379
No problem.

68
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,179
Hey.

69
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,379
Why didn't you ask about the wrapper of the straw?

70
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,279
It could've served as conclusive evidence, and yet...

71
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,479
Just what're you talking about?

72
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,779
Don't tell me it's because she's beautiful

73
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,679
and you finally got to know her.

74
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:56,479
I sure hope you're not going to say something dopey like that.

75
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,179
Personal emotions are to be left out when investigating,

76
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,679
right, Inspector Shiratori?

77
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,979
Indeed.

78
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,679
Exactly.

79
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,779
Buy a drink at this store?

80
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,279
I'm not thirsty, though.

81
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,379
Never mind, just buy one

82
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,779
and do as I say from now.

83
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:30,979
Hey.

84
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,879
I've figured out

85
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,879
the reason why Inspector Shiratori hesitated.

86
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,079
I measured it as you told me to.

87
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,879
And? How long is it?

88
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,979
Isn't it a bit short?

89
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,279
No, it was exactly the same.

90
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,179
I see.

91
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,179
So, it was the same,

92
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,979
It seems he got the answer he was looking for.

93
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,879
Yeah.

94
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,379
The answer to a sad result.

95
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,879
But the cherry blossom mark

96
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,379
is what all police officers have on them!

97
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,979
It's strong, kind and awesome,

98
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,179
a flower of justice!

99
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,879
Taking into consideration Ms. Kasakura's testimony...

100
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,879
While she was watching a movie at the theater today,

101
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,779
the stalker came into this room,

102
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:41,479
and killed Mr. Yoshiro Somei

103
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,479
who was waiting in her room for her to come home.

104
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,879
I guess there's no doubt that he fled the scene after that.

105
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,679
I can't really come to any conclusion

106
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,579
unless we question the people in this vicinity.

107
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,679
What about the children?

108
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,379
I've asked the elementary school teacher

109
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,379
to come pick them up.

110
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,579
Since both Dr. Agasa and Mr. Mouri weren't home.

111
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,779
Do you still have something you want to confirm with the children about?

112
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,479
No.

113
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,579
Inspector Shiratori.

114
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,579
Well, then, Ms. Kasakura,

115
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,479
please come to the station with me,

116
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
so that I can ask you some questions on the case.

117
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,379
But could I be given permission to spend some time alone?

118
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,279
I'm quite shocked over his death, you see.

119
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,079
I guess so.

120
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,879
Then, after you've gotten yourself together again,

121
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,679
-I'll send one of my men over to pick you up... -No.

122
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,979
Please have her come to the station right away.

123
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,979
Not as a material witness,

124
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,779
but as a suspect of this homicide case.

125
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:02,101
The one who murdered Mr. Yoshiro Somei in this room...

126
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,401
is you, isn't it, Ms. Nami Kasakura?

127
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,801
Hey, hey. Just what're you talking about?

128
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,401
From the estimated time of death of the victim,

129
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,701
the crime was around 14:00 today.

130
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:24,001
At that time, Ms. Kasakura was seated in the theatre next to you

131
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,901
watching the movie, isn't that what you said?

132
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,701
Moreover, the victim had called Ms. Kasahara on her cell phone

133
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,801
just before he was murdered.

134
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,801
And the children who were sitting behind you

135
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,701
saw that she received the call, you know?

136
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,501
Yeah! We saw it. It was pitch dark,

137
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,401
but there was a flash of light in the seat in front and it got bright.

138
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,601
I saw that lady who was wearing a hat.

139
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:51,401
That flash of light meant that she received a call.

140
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,801
Right? Conan, you saw it with Ai too, didn't you?

141
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:55,901
Yeah.

142
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,401
I did see it.

143
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:01,401
The knitted hat that she was wearing.

144
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:07,201
Right. It's not that we saw her in person.

145
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,301
What we saw

146
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,301
was the person who was made to wear the hat

147
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:12,701
and was shined on by the light of the cell phone.

148
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:15,901
The person who emerged in the dark.

149
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,701
In other words, what we saw was the silhouette of Inspector Shiratori

150
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,201
who was sitting in the seat next to her.

151
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:24,701
That's right, isn't it, Inspector Shiratori?

152
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:25,801
Yeah.

153
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,101
But, even if the cell phone emitted light,

154
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:32,401
if it's not near the face, isn't it hard to see it?

155
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,301
It was on top the cup of coke.

156
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,301
If the cell phone is placed opened on the cup, then...

157
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,601
it would be the same distance as

158
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,401
when you pick it up by hand, when it shines.

159
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:49,101
Of course, the vibe and ringtone were both switched off.

160
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,701
But if so, wouldn't the people in the surrounding seats

161
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,901
think that something funny is happening?

162
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,301
If there were people right near our seats,

163
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:58,801
then maybe they would have doubts,

164
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,301
but the aisle was behind our seats

165
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:03,301
and the seats to both of our sides were empty.

166
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,401
It is highly possible

167
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:10,401
Ms. Kasahara also bought the tickets for both the seats on the internet.

168
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,301
Sitting just one seat away,

169
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:16,301
it is virtually impossible to see what anyone is doing in the dark.

170
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:22,201
Which means that you just happened to buy

171
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,601
the seat beside her that she didn't buy?

172
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,801
Yes.

173
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,001
Even if I didn't buy it,

174
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,001
since it's the seat of a movie that is popular

175
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,101
and more so, it being Sunday,

176
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:33,501
the seat would've eventually been taken by someone right away.

177
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:36,701
If the ticket is bought on the internet,

178
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:37,901
it's possible to see on screen

179
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,501
the number of seats that are already taken.

180
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,301
Ms. Kasakura who saw that the five seats

181
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,601
behind the seats that she had purchased were taken,

182
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,701
in order to verify that the seats belonged to the children,

183
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,601
were watching them from near the ticket vending machine

184
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:49,501
before the movie started.

185
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,101
Then, she deliberately pretended to forget her wallet

186
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,601
in front of the children.

187
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,901
After making sure that the children sees her wallet,

188
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:55,801
she befriends them.

189
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,401
Then after watching the movie,

190
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,901
she takes the children with her to her condo,

191
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:02,201
and pretends to find the dead body together with the children.

192
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,401
She probably wanted the children to prove her alibi.

193
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,201
No way.

194
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:13,301
I'm pretty sure that after finding out I was a police detective,

195
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,701
she decided that taking me along with everyone would clear things faster.

196
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:20,301
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

197
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:26,001
But, unless you happened to fall asleep like you did,

198
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,701
she couldn't have committed the crime.

199
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,601
I just did not happen to.

200
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:34,301
It's most likely that in the cup of coke I drank from,

201
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:37,501
she poured in some sleeping drug or something.

202
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,201
Sleeping drug?

203
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,801
The thing is, before I went to my seat...

204
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,401
Seeing me searching for my seat

205
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,801
while looking at the half portion of my ticket,

206
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,801
after confirming that I was going to be the one sitting next to her

207
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,801
that she was going to place the hat on,

208
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,601
she deliberately bumped into me,

209
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,701
and spilled my coke.

210
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,101
She put the sleeping drug inside the cup that she brought back to me

211
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:59,401
in exchange for the coke she had spilled, and gave it to me.

212
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,301
Of course,

213
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,701
you can never tell if the sleeping drug would be effective

214
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,001
in a short amount of time

215
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,001
because that differs from person to person.

216
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,701
But if she were trying it over and over,

217
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,001
she would eventually run into someone like me

218
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,001
who would fall asleep completely.

219
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,701
Well, I guess we can figure that out by looking at

220
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:18,401
the history of the tickets she purchased.

221
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:21,001
We would probably find that she bought tickets

222
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,701
for the three seats in question

223
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:26,101
at the movie time on Saturday that is most crowded.

224
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:27,601
If not,

225
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:30,701
there is no way she would know in such detail

226
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,801
about the contents of the movie that she didn't get to see today.

227
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,001
Today is the first time I saw the movie!

228
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:38,301
The seat I bought for before was for a friend!

229
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,701
I invited the friend to come many times

230
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,101
but was turned down because something else came up.

231
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,201
Right! Please check if there is any sleeping drug

232
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,801
inside your coke cup.

233
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:50,601
It should be easy because your cup has something on it.

234
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:55,301
Are you referring to this flower?

235
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,701
The strip of flower you made

236
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:01,001
out of the paper straw wrapper that you stuck on my cup.

237
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,401
In fact, I tore one off

238
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:08,201
and have it stuck between the page of my notebook to remember you by.

239
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,001
So, if we check my cup that I threw away

240
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,401
into the trash box of the theater...

241
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,301
Here it is.

242
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:19,201
Then, please tell us about

243
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:21,501
the length of the strip of flower once again.

244
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:22,701
Yes, sir.

245
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:26,201
The length of the strip of flower

246
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:29,601
and a brand new straw wrapper was the same.

247
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,701
The same?

248
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,101
Strange.

249
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:35,801
Since Inspector Shiratori had torn off a piece,

250
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,801
it should be a bit short.

251
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,401
That's because...

252
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,601
When you left the theater once,

253
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:46,001
you took the cup with the sleeping drug inside it with you,

254
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,401
and when you came back in again,

255
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:51,601
you pasted a new strip of flowers onto the new cup.

256
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:54,101
So, she presumed that she would be investigated on it later.

257
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,701
Yes.

258
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,001
In other words, the crime was committed this way...

259
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,201
First, she becomes friendly with someone

260
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,401
who has come to watch the movie before it starts

261
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,101
in order to get herself an alibi.

262
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:04,401
She inserts a sleeping drug into the cup

263
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,701
of the person who sits next to her.

264
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:09,901
After confirming that the person had fallen asleep,

265
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,901
she places her hat on that person's head

266
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,701
then switches her cup

267
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,801
with the one the sleeping drug is inside,

268
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,301
and places the cell phone on the cup.

269
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,401
She takes the cup with the sleeping drug inside

270
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,901
out of the theater when she sneaks out.

271
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,801
She returns home on a cab,

272
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,901
and strikes Mr. Somei who is waiting there to death.

273
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:30,101
Right after that,

274
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,601
she call her own cell phone

275
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:32,801
that she had left behind at the theater,

276
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,101
using Mr. Somei's phone.

277
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,701
Then she makes the people

278
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,401
who will establish her alibi watch this

279
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,401
so that they will testify for her.

280
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,701
Then all she has left to do is to dispose of the cup

281
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,501
with the sleeping drug inside it and the murder weapon somewhere,

282
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,401
go back to the theater by cab,

283
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:50,001
take her hat off the person who is sitting next to her

284
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,901
and switch the cup that has her cell phone on it

285
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:55,901
with a new cup with the strip of flower on it.

286
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:00,901
She went out of the way to stick a new strip of flowers on the cup

287
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,601
because I tore the strip of flower off

288
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:06,501
not from the edge, but from part way.

289
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:10,201
It's most likely that she mistakenly thought that

290
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,801
she had torn off a part of the strip when she was sticking it on.

291
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:14,201
If she left it cut off as is,

292
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,301
when she is investigated,

293
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:18,201
it would disclose that the cup had been switched.

294
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:21,501
That's probably why she stuck a new strip on.

295
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,101
What's the big fuss about a measly strip of flower?

296
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,101
If you want to set me up as a criminal,

297
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,501
why don't you bring the cab driver

298
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,101
who drove me over here right this minute?

299
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,901
I'm sure they'll find that driver soon.

300
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,101
Because there's no doubt

301
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:40,901
that you rode a cab while the movie was playing.

302
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:42,601
I mean, you didn't know

303
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,801
that there was an earthquake during the movie, right?

304
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,601
Earthquake?

305
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,901
There was one, wasn't there?

306
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,801
Yeah! A pretty big one too.

307
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,001
It was right after the scene where Gomera's organs came in view.

308
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,901
I was so scared, I clinged on tight to Conan!

309
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:01,301
Well, it's no surprise if you were riding a car

310
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,901
and didn't notice the earthquake, though.

311
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:06,601
I... I just forgot to mention it!

312
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:09,701
Because I was upset over his death.

313
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,701
What? What's with all of you?

314
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,901
Why this sudden change in attitude?

315
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:20,301
Even you stood up for me in the beginning!

316
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,701
Hey!

317
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,401
When Inspector Megure asked me

318
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:29,001
about your alibi a while ago...

319
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,201
No.

320
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:34,001
I seem to have been sleeping just then.

321
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,701
I found the yarn from your hat on my hand

322
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:39,201
after I scratched my head.

323
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:43,201
That's why there's a high possibility

324
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,301
that you'll find my hair

325
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,601
on the inside of your hat.

326
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,901
Is that so?

327
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,201
Go ahead.

328
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:04,201
Then...

329
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,001
Go ahead and check it if you want to!

330
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,701
I'm sure you'll find what you want.

331
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:18,001
The frizzy hair of that police detective that puts on airs!

332
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,901
You admit that you committed the crime, then?

333
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,601
Yes, I killed him!

334
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:28,601
That revolting swindler!

335
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:29,701
Swindler?

336
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:35,101
I started going with that guy seven years ago.

337
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,501
When I was 20.

338
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:41,301
That guy was always in need of money

339
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:44,801
and who knows how much I gave him.

340
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,301
When I told him I had no more money I could give him,

341
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,501
he started saying that he wanted to

342
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,001
take the accessory I had to the pawn shop.

343
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:54,401
I gave it to him once,

344
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,001
but since it was my mother's keepsake,

345
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,301
I went to the pawn shop to get it back,

346
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:02,101
but was told that no one turned something like that in.

347
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,701
I got suspicious and followed him.

348
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:09,201
And that's when I saw.

349
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:13,601
A woman wearing the ring that was my mother's keepsake.

350
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:17,101
I found out later that she had been going with him from two years

351
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,701
before I even met him,

352
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:22,701
and that she was engaged to him too.

353
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:26,001
Why didn't you report it to the police?

354
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:29,301
That's indeed a case of swindling.

355
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,301
Telling the police would only get that guy arrested.

356
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:36,801
I won't get back the seven years that I lost.

357
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:41,001
That's why I put an end to that guy's life!

358
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,801
As punishment for wasting seven years of my young and beautiful life,

359
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:47,201
as well as spending all my cash!

360
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:52,401
Well, I never thought that the police was of any good,

361
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,101
so I figured I had to do it myself.

362
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:01,601
Okay, let's go.

363
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,201
It's too bad.

364
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:10,301
You were not like that before.

365
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:14,201
Huh? Did you know me before?

366
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:18,401
Yes. I doubt you remember, though.

367
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:27,801
Let me tell you then.

368
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:32,101
It's a man's ego that makes them think that women don't change!

369
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:35,301
But, we do. Depending on what happens,

370
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,001
we go from angels to devils!

371
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:43,201
Like they say, a woman's heart is as changeable as the autumn sky!

372
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:49,201
That lady is really cruel.

373
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:50,701
She really went overboard.

374
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,601
What's an ego?

375
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,601
It's being selfishly one-track minded.

376
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,301
Are you all right?

377
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:06,601
Inspector Shiratori has so many things going on at once.

378
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,901
Hey, do you want me to go call Officer Sato?

379
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,101
I know her phone number.

380
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:15,201
No, please don't do that.

381
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,801
Never mind. Just leave me alone.

382
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,501
Here you go.

383
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,701
Huh?

384
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,301
It's a reward for arresting the criminal.

385
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,601
I made it with a straw wrapper a while ago!

386
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,001
This is...

387
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,601
cherry blossom.

388
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,001
A cherry blossom

389
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,001
is the mark that all people of the police have on them!

390
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,901
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

391
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,001
a flower of justice!

392
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,701
Who told you that?

393
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:49,601
Ms. Kobayashi!

394
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:53,001
She taught me how to make it the other day.

395
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,501
Excuse me.

396
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,801
Who's Ms. Kobayashi?

397
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:59,201
I heard that the children of my class are here,

398
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,101
so I've come for them.

399
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:28,001
It's Ms. Kobayashi!

400
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,601
Then, please take care of them.

401
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,001
Yes, sir. I'll take the cab and see them home.

402
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:35,001
No.

403
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,501
If it's okay with you, let's take my car.

404
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:40,901
Yes, sir.

405
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,101
Thank you.

406
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,901
On top of the children having been a bother,

407
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:49,301
thank you so much for driving them home.

408
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:52,101
No problem at all.

409
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:56,401
An unexpected happy ending I'd say.

410
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,301
Yeah.

411
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:01,501
Cherry blossoms bloom, as they say.

412
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:10,301
"Next Episode"

413
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,501
Soshima?

414
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,301
Let's let the people of the jurisdiction

415
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:15,601
take care of this case as an accident.

416
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:16,801
Please wait!

417
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:18,701
I still can't believe it!

418
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,501
Enough!

419
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,401
Go cool your head outside!

420
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:26,801
The rate isn't a 100, but neither is it zero.

421
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:30,201
If he bet on the odds...

422
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,801
Don't tell me that...

423
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:33,101
Next Conan,

424
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:36,266
"Crime with Zero Proven Evidence".

425
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,419
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,819
"Nail art".

427
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,419
The next title

428
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,119
refers to a crime that cannot be solved, right?

429
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,619
What?
