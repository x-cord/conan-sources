1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,840
The employees of a company called New Image

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,640
are attacked one after the other and are seriously injured.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,640
And the president of New Image receives a threatening call.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,740
Furthermore, Mr. Mouri was appointed by the culprit

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,940
to make the delivery.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,240
M is going south down Chuo Boulevard.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
The cruiser that M is on board sailed under Minato Bridge just now.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,540
The culprit's planning to get the money somewhere along the river.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,940
Keep your eyes open.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,940
Roger.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,940
The waves of the transceiver

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,640
works only in a range of at most, 100 meters.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,040
The culprit should be somewhere in this range.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,740
It's about time you start working for me.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,840
That cruiser is headed for Oojima water gate

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
and will be going into Ooyoko River.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,140
Then, put the briefcase on the roof of the cruiser.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,540
Put it in the center so that it doesn't fall.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,440
Then, go back to your seat and wait for the next contact.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,740
That brat...

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,740
M has entered Heikyu River.

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,640
The briefcase is on the roof of the cruiser.

23
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,340
The briefcase is gone!

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,940
The criminal used an attache case with an electromagnet stashed inside.

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,440
They used this technique

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,540
so the case would stick to the frame of the bridge

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,140
and the could artfully get away with the 24,000,000 yen.

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,040
We thought it was suspicious

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,140
that the culprit designated pops as the courier,

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,140
so we investigated and the one man emerged.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,240
Satoshi Nishizawa, he was New Image's mechanical engineer.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,640
We found out through pop's investigation

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,340
that he had been guilty of stalking.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,740
So, New Images had fired him.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,740
Mr. Nishizawa. Are you in?

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,340
Mr. Nishizawa!

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,840
It seems he's not in.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,940
Yes.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,340
It's open.

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Mr. Nishizawa, aren't you home?

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,240
Mr. Nishizawa!

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Conan.

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,140
No, Conan.

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,440
You shouldn't go into other people's houses without permission.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,640
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

47
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
The culprit dies so the case is closed?

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,740
Where is the ransom and where is the case headed to?

49
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,540
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,379
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 2)"

53
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,979
Mr. Nishizawa.

54
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,479
Wait, Ran.

55
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,179
Look.

56
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:18,679
Although the water is up to the brim of the bath tub,

57
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,979
there's no water splashed around anywhere.

58
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,279
It probably dried up.

59
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,179
This means that Mr. Nishzawa sunk in the water quite a while ago.

60
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:31,279
I think it's been more than 6 hours already.

61
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,779
Oh, no.

62
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,679
At any rate Ran, contact the police.

63
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,679
Okay.

64
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,679
An empty pill bottle Sleeping pills.

65
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,379
A flower petal?

66
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,079
I wonder what flower the petal is from?

67
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,179
It s shape is like that of a cherry blossom, but the color...

68
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:58,179
Hey, Ran. What're you doing over here?

69
00:05:58,179 --> 00:05:59,479
Officer Sato!

70
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,379
Mr. Nishizawa in the bath tub is...

71
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,979
What?

72
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,179
-Mr. Nishizawa. -He's dead already.

73
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,479
Conan?

74
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,679
Officer Takagi, contact HQ!

75
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,379
Yes, ma'am!

76
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,979
Officer Sato.

77
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,479
What brings you here?

78
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,979
A stolen motorboat was found on Heikyu River,

79
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,879
and Satoshi Nishizawa's fingerprints were found there.

80
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,079
So, now that you know,

81
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,279
leave the rest to us and out you go, out.

82
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,279
Okay.

83
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,879
Then, let's go out so that,

84
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,979
we don't get in their way, Conan.

85
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:34,979
Hey.

86
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,879
Conan, no!

87
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,079
This is?

88
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,079
"Mouri Detective Agency"

89
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,279
Nishizawa committed suicide.

90
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,079
The boat that he seems to have used to commit the crime was found

91
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,779
and his fingerprints were detected on it.

92
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:08,679
Besides, here's the will that was found inside his computer.

93
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,379
The estimated time of his death is around 01:00 am.

94
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,379
He drowned after over dosing himself with sleeping pills.

95
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,979
There's probably no mistake that it's suicide.

96
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,479
I didn't commit this crime because I wanted money.

97
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,679
Kogoro Mouri, you had the nerve to hand me over to the police

98
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,679
saying that pure feeling of love was nothing but stalking.

99
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:36,679
Moreover, President Ishida fired me.

100
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,979
I'll put you to shame, world renown detective

101
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,679
and President Ishida, who couldn't save an employee of yours.

102
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:45,779
My purpose this time is to punish both you and the president socially.

103
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,279
I no longer intend to live on in shame.

104
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,079
I don't have any reason to go on living anymore.

105
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,879
Well, although we can't conclude anything

106
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,779
before we do a thorough check yet, but...

107
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,779
for now, we'll have to report on the progress we're making.

108
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:01,779
Inspector.

109
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,779
Was the money that was stolen found?

110
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,479
No, not yet.

111
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,779
I see.

112
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,179
See you then, Mouri.

113
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,579
It hasn't finished yet.

114
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,079
The money hasn't come out yet,

115
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,679
so how can the case be closed!

116
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:27,079
The case is just starting to be solved!

117
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,479
I don't anything about Mr. Nishizawa.

118
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,179
I heard that you both got along well.

119
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,779
Tell me what you know.

120
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,679
"Kaoru Tanaka" -Even if it may not be something too convenient for you?

121
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,079
Yeah, go ahead.

122
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:48,379
Let's hear it.

123
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:51,379
Mr. Nishizawa hated you.

124
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,379
Yeah. It seems so...

125
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:56,679
And, did you hear about his plans as to this case?

126
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,679
No, nothing.

127
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,579
I see.

128
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,579
By the way...

129
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:04,179
What about your alibi at about 01:00 am?

130
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,079
Mine?

131
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,479
Why do I need an alibi?

132
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,779
He committed suicide, didn't he?

133
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,579
We don't know for sure yet.

134
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,479
Well, if we check on President Ishida's acquaintances,

135
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,179
we'll eventually come up with an answer, though.

136
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,879
Then, stop suspecting me and suspect the president.

137
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,479
Mr. Nishizawa was blackmailing President Ishida.

138
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,079
Are you blackmailing me?

139
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,379
Are presidents supposed to protect their employees?

140
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,079
You lowered the image of the company

141
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,479
and yet the nerve of you.

142
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,979
If you fired me, pay me compensation.

143
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,679
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,979
I'll disclose your accounting fraud!

145
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:52,079
I could care less if this company goes bankrupt!

146
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,079
Cool it, let's talk it over.

147
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,279
I think the president has a motive to kill Mr. Nishizawa.

148
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,679
I'm asking for your alibi.

149
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,279
If at around 01:00 am,

150
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,479
I was at home, on the phone with my girlfriend.

151
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,879
Your cell phone won't serve as an alibi.

152
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,379
It was my house phone.

153
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,879
If you suspect me why don't you check on my call history or whatever.

154
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,279
You don't need to check it.

155
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,879
It's suicide, isn't it?

156
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,579
Don't you want to get back your 24,000,000 yen?

157
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:26,579
"Gen Ishida (42)" -I don't want such petty money.

158
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,879
I can get that much profit by selling a car anytime.

159
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,479
Good work, just forget it, already.

160
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,179
No matter if Nishizawa designated you,

161
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,979
I can see it wasn't an easy job.

162
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,679
So, keep it.

163
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,079
What's your alibi at 01:00 am?

164
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,179
Me? I was sleeping.

165
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:48,379
I'm single so I've got nobody to verify it though.

166
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,679
Sorry to have intruded on you.

167
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,779
Aren't you taking it?

168
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,479
Why don't you use it for Nishizawa's funeral?

169
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,679
Why don't you suspect Tanaka who was Nishizawa's subordinate?

170
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,179
He was hanging around with Nishizawa

171
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,279
and loved to gamble.

172
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,079
He has quite a large sum of debts.

173
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,579
He came to me once, but it wasn't an amount

174
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,379
that he could return even if I were to give him advance payment,

175
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,779
so I turned him down.

176
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,879
A surveillance camera.

177
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,579
That was close.

178
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:25,679
Come to think of it,

179
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,979
there was no surveillance camera on that road!

180
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,579
There's no surveillance camera here either.

181
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,579
It's not cool to go straight.

182
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,279
It's Toyosu Canal.

183
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,679
Taking the route that I just came,

184
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,779
since there are no surveillance cameras images

185
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,679
to serve as evidence won't remain.

186
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,179
If he left the boat here

187
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,079
and went out to Ooyoko River

188
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,379
and retrieved the briefcase.

189
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,779
Gramps!

190
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,079
If you take this side route,

191
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,979
it leads to the direction of Sendai Bori River.

192
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,679
Lower your head.

193
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,679
It's narrow, but a motorboat could probably make it in here, right?

194
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,679
Yeah.

195
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,179
Cherry blossoms in full bloom are beautiful, aren't they?

196
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,179
Yes.

197
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,879
Stop over there.

198
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,879
What?

199
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,179
It's Mr. Nishizawa's apartment after all.

200
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,179
But, no yellow flower looks to be in sight.

201
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,179
Did you find something?

202
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,479
No.

203
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,179
Hey, do you know any yellow flowers

204
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,979
that have petals that look like cherry blossoms?

205
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,479
Yeah, there's something called the Ukon Sakura.

206
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,279
Ukon Sakura?

207
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,279
You can find them only in Tsukuda in this area.

208
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,279
They normally bloom later than the Somei Yoshino.

209
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,679
This year however, they're already in bloom.

210
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,879
I'd like to see that!

211
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,579
What? You've figured out the real culprit!

212
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,079
I have someone in mind, Inspector Megure.

213
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,279
You mean Nishizawa didn't do it and he didn't commit suicide?

214
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,879
That's right.

215
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,979
Who's the real culprit?

216
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,679
I'll leave you in suspense.

217
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,779
Please tell the President of New Image Mr. Ishida,

218
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,479
and engineer Mr. Tanaka

219
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,679
to come to the president's room of New Image at 05:00 pm today.

220
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,179
Okay, but...

221
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,379
I hope you know what you're doing, Mouri.

222
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,479
Please trust, Kogoro Mouri here.

223
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,079
Dad.

224
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,479
I told you not to carry yourself too far.

225
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,879
Stay in bed like you should be.

226
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,079
I understand! I'll head there immediately!

227
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,579
Inspector. There seems to be a large amount of 10,000 yen bills

228
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:25,079
floating in the Tsukuda area of Sumida River.

229
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,079
It's yesterday's money, isn't it?

230
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,179
An empty briefcase seems to have been found,

231
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,479
so I guess the contents flowed out.

232
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,679
Strange.

233
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,979
The place where the empty briefcase was found is here.

234
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:48,379
And this is where I am now.

235
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:52,079
Why isn't there any money flowing in the rivers along the way?

236
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,729
Not with this fever, dad.

237
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:13,529
I've got to put on the world renown detective,

238
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,329
Kogoro Mouri's deduction show from 05:00 pm.

239
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:17,729
I can't be stuck in bed because of a cold.

240
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,329
Geez.

241
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:20,529
What's the matter?

242
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,729
Stop him, Conan.

243
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:25,929
Dad insists on doing his deduction show and won't listen to me.

244
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,529
Have you figured out the culprit?

245
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,129
I'll leave you in suspense till 05:00 pm.

246
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,129
Come to think of it,

247
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,629
some of the money that was taken was found in Sumida River.

248
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,229
What?

249
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,429
It seems that the money was disposed of.

250
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,129
This man.

251
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:43,629
Oh, no.

252
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,129
If the money is found, my deduction won't do.

253
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:50,429
I think my fever's suddenly risen.

254
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:53,029
That's why I've been telling you not to go.

255
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,529
Would you like me to go in place of you?

256
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,229
You have a video camera, don't you?

257
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:59,229
Yes.

258
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:01,829
All we have to do, is film your deduction

259
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:03,729
and show it to everybody.

260
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,329
Since Pops Kogoro can't make it because of a cold,

261
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,429
I was told to show you this recorded video film.

262
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,829
Never mind the formalities and just get on with it.

263
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,329
I'm busy.

264
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:16,429
Okay!

265
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:22,029
People refer to me as the renown detective.

266
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,929
Yes, I am...

267
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:29,229
Kogoro Mouri.

268
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:32,429
There are two keys to solving the case this time.

269
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,629
First, a grudge against New Image.

270
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:39,829
And, second, someone who has a grudge against me, Kogoro Mouri.

271
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,229
"Rather, the culprit utalized these two key issues"

272
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:46,429
There are three suspects.

273
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:50,229
Mr. Satoshi Nishizawa, who died after leaving a will behind.

274
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:52,829
His subordinate, Atsushi Tanaka,

275
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:57,029
and the president of New Image, Mr. Gen Nishida.

276
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,629
Mr. Satoshi Nishizawa had a grudge

277
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:03,129
against the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri and President Ishida.

278
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:07,529
Moreover, he was blackmailing President Ishida.

279
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,029
Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,829
I was being blackmail by Nishizawa you say?

281
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,229
Show me the evidence!

282
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,529
As for you, President Ishida,

283
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,829
you have no alibi at the time the money taken at Ooyoko River

284
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,429
and moreover, during the estimate time of death of Mr. Nishizawa.

285
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:25,129
If Mr. Nishizawa were to have been killed, that is...

286
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,229
That doesn't make me the culprit, does it?

287
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:30,829
But in the case of Mr. Tanaka,

288
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,929
there is nothing that leads to him having a grudge

289
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:36,329
against New Image or to kill Mr. Nishizawa.

290
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:41,329
Besides, he has an alibi during the time Mr. Nishizawa was found dead.

291
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,329
I'm glad you found out.

292
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:48,629
Only, you like gambling and had a great sum of debt.

293
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:50,029
If taken from that point of view,

294
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:53,629
you have a motive to commit the crime,

295
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:55,829
but Mr. Tanaka is clear after all.

296
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:58,329
"That may not be certain!"

297
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,829
Why?

298
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,129
Taking into consideration that will that was left behind

299
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:06,029
in Mr. Nishizawa's room,

300
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,929
setting the electromagnet onto the briefcase,

301
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:12,129
stealing the motorboat that was docked,

302
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,929
stealing the money at Ooyoko River,

303
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,629
then disposing the money and briefcase into the river,

304
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,729
return to his apartment and drink the sleeping pills,

305
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:23,029
and finally sink himself in the bath tub.

306
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:25,729
In other words, Mr. Nishizawa committed suicide...

307
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:31,029
"This would've happened, but, in fast, he was murdered!"

308
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:34,329
Just what is Detective Mouri trying to get at?

309
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,329
"The real culprit is you!"

310
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:41,429
From here, I will read Detective Mouri's deduction from here.

311
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,329
Will you be all right, Conan?

312
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,429
Yes.

313
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,329
According to Detective Mouri,

314
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,529
the real culprit is...

315
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,129
you, Mr. Tanaka!

316
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,129
What?

317
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:57,729
Just what're you talking about?

318
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,829
I've got an alibi, don't I?

319
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:02,229
But you seem to be great debt

320
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:05,229
of about 20,000,000 yen with a financial institution.

321
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,729
You committed this crime in order to repay that money.

322
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,229
More than the motive,

323
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:12,629
how are you going to explain my alibi?

324
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,329
I'll explain things in chronological order.

325
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:19,029
Mr. Tanaka who stole the money, didn't dispose of the money

326
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,629
but after disposing of only the empty briefcase and electromagnet,

327
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:27,029
used the waterway and went to Mr. Nishizawa's apartment.

328
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:30,329
Then after passing Mr. Nishzawa out

329
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:35,029
carried him onto the boat and went back to your own condo.

330
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,029
Your condo is in Tsukuda,

331
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:39,929
so you can move from place to place using the waterway.

332
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,729
You made Mr. Nishizawa drink an over dose of sleeping pills

333
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:48,929
to make it look like a suicide, and made preparations to kill him.

334
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,829
At the same time that you called your girlfriend from your house phone,

335
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:56,429
you poured hot water into the bath tub where Mr. Nishizawa was sleeping.

336
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,829
I was doubtful

337
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:05,629
because the time you were talking to your girlfriend on the phone

338
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:08,529
matched the estimate time of death of Mr. Nishizawa.

339
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,429
So much so, that it seemed to be an alibi creating scheme.

340
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,229
And then, you made a great mistake.

341
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:20,229
You didn't notice that the petal of an Ukon Sakura

342
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:23,729
that is in bloom near your condo got stuck on Mr. Nishizawa's clothes.

343
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:28,029
After making an alibi for yourself by phoning your girlfriend,

344
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,929
you used the waterway again

345
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,929
and returned to Mr. Nishizawa's apartment on your boat

346
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,529
and put the dead body into the bath tub.

347
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:39,029
In other words, you changed not the time of death,

348
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,329
but rather the place.

349
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:49,429
But, you didn't realize the petal of the Ukon Sakura at all.

350
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:51,829
You had a debt of 20,000,000 yen.

351
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,429
At first you were planning

352
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,029
to take the entire amount of 24,000,000 yen but...

353
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,429
To make it look as if this crime was committed

354
00:20:57,429 --> 00:20:58,929
because of a grudge and not for money,

355
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,929
since you left a will behind in the computer,

356
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,429
you had no choice but to dispose of the 4,000,000 yen

357
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,829
after paying of your debt, so you threw it into the river

358
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:11,329
to substantiate Mr. Nishizawa's will.

359
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,829
Is that correct, Mr. Tanaka?

360
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,129
It's all just a bunch of baloney!

361
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,629
It's all just made up!

362
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:20,629
I saw you riding a motorbike at Ooyoko River.

363
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:25,929
That was close.

364
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:28,929
Before and after the money was taken...

365
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,129
I had a close call with the motorbike.

366
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,929
It was the same number plate as this.

367
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,929
It's your motorbike, isn't it?

368
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,529
It was parked in this parking lot.

369
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:46,729
You used the road without surveillance cameras to your advantage,

370
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:48,629
but I saw you.

371
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,529
Darn! How dare you feign looking like a good guy

372
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,329
and still murder somebody?

373
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,629
Mr. Ishida.

374
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:09,429
I will report your accounting fraud to the second division.

375
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,929
I advise that you be ready for it.

376
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,729
I'm sure the tax office will get to you too.

377
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:17,129
That's quite a problem.

378
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,429
Can't something be done about it, officer?

379
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:20,829
Of course not!

380
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,929
Well, just as expected of Mouri.

381
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:49,329
Will you tell him that he did a great job

382
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,729
despite being under the weather, Conan?

383
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:53,829
Okay!

384
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,929
I edited everything in this.

385
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:09,529
We're finally in Kyoto!

386
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:11,829
-How exciting! -Yes!

387
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,629
Hey, is it true that all the chocolate flavors disappeared?

388
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,629
The chocolate flavors disappeared?

389
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,529
What does disappeared mean?

390
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,829
How did such a thing happen?

391
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,829
Huh? Why?

392
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,629
They say that the sweets that were here disappeared!

393
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,529
You know, I'm a great detective.

394
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,429
It's duck soup for me.

395
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,129
Next Conan,

396
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:36,929
"Famed Shop's Sweets Disappears".

397
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:54,829
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,929
"Japanese sweet box".
