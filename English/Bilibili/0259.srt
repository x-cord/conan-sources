1
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:03,624
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:05,624
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,524
Ayumi's idea breaks the code.

4
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:09,424
Who is the person full of mystery?

5
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,024
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:14,824
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:03,537
The gang and I went to see "Paul and Annie's Animal Show".

9
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,837
After the show, we went outside

10
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,337
and saw a man named James Black in trouble

11
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,437
having been mistaken for someone else so we went to his rescue.

12
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:13,137
Later, Mr. Black went to get his car

13
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,837
to take us to a restaurant

14
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,837
but he simply disappeared.

15
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:23,437
Leaving behind his blood stained strap.

16
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:31,437
"The Man From Chicago (Part 2)"

17
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:35,037
P and A?

18
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,337
What does it mean?

19
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:38,437
It was on the ground.

20
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:41,237
I'm sure it's a message from Mr. Black

21
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,837
telling us about the kidnappers.

22
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:47,737
Look! There's blood on the P and the & and the A.

23
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,937
Well, for now...

24
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,837
We'll take back to the station

25
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,437
and check to see if it's real blood.

26
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,137
Come back to the police box tomorrow.

27
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,737
Hey!

28
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:13,137
Gosh. If we only knew what he meant by that P and A...

29
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:16,237
Maybe he meant P and A together, to make "pa".

30
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,437
Maybe he meant the name of a shop?

31
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,737
You know, like "panya" (bakery).

32
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,337
No.

33
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,637
If he was in trouble and he wanted to get "pa" across,

34
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:30,137
he'd have smeared blood on the "Pa" in Paul.

35
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:33,237
I think we should think of the P and the A separately.

36
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,037
P and A...

37
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,637
Pink and Aka (red)...

38
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,737
Pro wrestling, anpan (bread filled with bean jam).

39
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:44,837
Personal computer, access...

40
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:47,237
Pistol and assassin.

41
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,737
Come on.

42
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:53,037
Maybe he meant parking area!

43
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:55,837
A parking lot!

44
00:03:55,837 --> 00:04:00,037
But we don't know which parking lot.

45
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,237
Wait until I finish.

46
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:04,837
Maybe he was trying to tell us

47
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:08,437
he left a clue at the parking lot his car was parked.

48
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:10,637
Yes. I thought the same thing

49
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:13,037
so I checked the place out but I didn't find anything.

50
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,537
I see.

51
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:19,137
Gosh. I just can't figure it out.

52
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,637
I guess we don't have any other choice

53
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,237
except to ask around this neighborhood

54
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,237
with the assumption they're still in the area.

55
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:26,637
All right! Let's all split up

56
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:29,137
and ask around the neighborhood

57
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:32,737
to see if anyone saw two men take a foreigner away.

58
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:33,937
If you learn something,

59
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:36,037
contact the others with your badge.

60
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:37,737
Okay...

61
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,537
-Huh? -What's wrong, Ayumi?

62
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:44,637
I can't find my badge.

63
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:46,537
You're kidding.

64
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,837
Maybe you dropped it someplace.

65
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:50,737
I don't understand.

66
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,837
It was here when I showed it Mr. Black.

67
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,637
Oh, Sherlock Holmes!

68
00:04:57,637 --> 00:05:02,137
I think Mr. Black might still have my badge.

69
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,537
-What? -Are you sure?

70
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,737
Yes, pretty sure.

71
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:10,837
Then the transmitter built inside it

72
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,237
will give us his location.

73
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:14,337
There they are!

74
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:17,037
16 kilometers northwest from here.

75
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,537
They're moving north

76
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:21,137
along Temuzu Rivers and Ikumo Highway

77
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,837
judging by the speed, they're in a car.

78
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,737
They're in a car?

79
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:27,237
On the Ikumo Highway?

80
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:28,737
Heading north?

81
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:31,437
All set. Now that we know that much.

82
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,137
What?

83
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,237
You want me to put up a roadblock

84
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:44,437
on Ikumo Highway at the Saitama border?

85
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,737
You're asking me to do the impossible, Conan.

86
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,237
I can't order a roadblock

87
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:49,737
on unsubstantiated information like that.

88
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:53,437
But that man might get killed if you don't.

89
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,337
But nonetheless...

90
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,937
Conan, is that you? This is Sato.

91
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:02,637
There was a traffic accident in that area just now,

92
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,737
and Yumi is handling the traffic.

93
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,437
I can ask her to check for suspicious cars.

94
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:08,637
That shouldn't be any problem.

95
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:12,137
Height, 180.

96
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,837
An American of English descent about 50 to 60 years old,

97
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:17,537
beard and glasses.

98
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,437
Look for the car he's in, right?

99
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:24,337
Got it. I'll tell her to stop the car if she sees it.

100
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:27,837
What? The kidnappers might be armed?

101
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:30,737
Yes, okay.

102
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:34,837
Don't worry. Takagi and I will go there right now.

103
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,837
What? Me, too?

104
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:41,437
What's the big deal?

105
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:44,237
We've got nothing to do until later tonight.

106
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,337
Besides, whenever that kid gets involved,

107
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,437
things get interesting.

108
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:51,637
Okay. We're heading there too.

109
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:54,137
Dr. Agasa, please bring the car around.

110
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:58,137
After all, we're the only ones who can identify Mr. Black.

111
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,737
All right, I understand!

112
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:06,637
Listen. Doesn't something strike you as odd?

113
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:12,637
Mr. Black was brought here through the alley by two men

114
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:15,237
and then transferred into another car.

115
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:16,737
it would mean he had to cut himself on the finger

116
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,337
and leave the blood code

117
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,337
while he was walking through the alley, isnt that right?

118
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,437
Yes.

119
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:24,737
I guess so, the man must have threatened him with a gun

120
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:28,137
while he was in the parking lot.

121
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,137
He must've put the blood on the strap

122
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:32,637
when they weren't watching.

123
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:35,537
Or maybe he went with them willingly

124
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,337
knowing full well they were up to no good

125
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:40,037
and left us that message.

126
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:42,637
What're you trying to say?

127
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:45,137
I feel something.

128
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:46,537
Like something's calling me.

129
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,637
Aren't you over reacting?

130
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,137
I hope you're right.

131
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,137
Hey! Did you see that?

132
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:07,537
Did you see who was driving that car?

133
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,237
No. It went by too fast.

134
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:13,137
Is that so?

135
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:42,637
A foreigner...

136
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,537
Let's see.

137
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,037
No.

138
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:49,137
A foreigner...

139
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,837
A foreigner.

140
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:55,137
Let's see.

141
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:58,237
Excuse me.

142
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,237
Yes?

143
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,837
I hate to ask, but could you let us through?

144
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:03,237
We've got to get this guy

145
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:06,737
on the scene investigation done by sundown.

146
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:09,337
So, you're working a case.

147
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:11,737
Yes, nothing major. The guy's small time.

148
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:14,637
He wrecked his girlfriend's house, that's all.

149
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,137
No problem. Go on ahead.

150
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,837
We really appreciate this.

151
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:28,137
Where was I?

152
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:31,137
Look for a foreigner. A foreigner.

153
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,737
What? You didn't see them?

154
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:39,137
-Are you sure? -You know he's a foreigner?

155
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:42,537
Yes. I didn't see a single foreigner.

156
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,837
What do you think happened, Conan?

157
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:47,437
Where is the car now?

158
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,937
They're on the move about 8 kilometers from here

159
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,337
but my batteries are running low.

160
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,837
I don't get it though.

161
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:56,337
How'd they get past this roadblock?

162
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:00,237
If that guy's got one of our badges,

163
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:03,137
all we have to do is ask him where he is.

164
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:07,637
No. The kidnappers will hear us beeping him.

165
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:11,437
I guess we have to figure out what that P and A means.

166
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:12,537
There's a possibility

167
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,737
that it's referring to where they're headed.

168
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,537
I've got it! Parfait and anmitsu (jelly like dessert).

169
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,337
So maybe a restaurant!

170
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:24,137
How about perm and afro referring to a beauty salon?

171
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,637
Can't you guys think a little more seriously?

172
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:28,737
How about this then?

173
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:32,437
Pelican and ashika (seal) for zoo?

174
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:35,237
You know, since Mr. Black likes animals.

175
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:37,837
You're wrong. If he meant zoo,

176
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,837
he'd have put blood on the word "animal"

177
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,237
on the title "Animal Show".

178
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:44,137
I see! So that's what it was!

179
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:46,137
Nice going, Ayumi!

180
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:48,437
What?

181
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,037
I've figured it out.

182
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:52,237
I know where Mr. Black is.

183
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:58,937
What?

184
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:00,637
The kidnappers are...

185
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:02,937
in a police car?

186
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,137
I don't believe it. It can't be.

187
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,137
It's true!

188
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,937
If we don't go after them before it get dark, we'll lose them.

189
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:14,937
Yumi. What happened?

190
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:19,137
Did you get the kidnappers Conan was telling us about?

191
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,037
So, where are the kidnappers?

192
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:25,737
Well... they're saying that the men are in a police car.

193
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:27,237
What?

194
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:28,737
Yes.

195
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:31,837
-A police car? -That's right.

196
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:36,037
The message Mr. Black for us, the P and A,

197
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:38,437
it stands for police car.

198
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:42,237
I still don't understand. Why does P and A stand for police car?

199
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:47,037
Take the "and" symbol, spell it out and connect to the P and A.

200
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:51,137
Let's see. P and A...

201
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:53,437
P And A...

202
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:56,237
Panda?

203
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,637
That's it, panda!

204
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:02,937
I see! A police car is black and white.

205
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:06,037
The same as a panda! I get it.

206
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,037
Conan, you're so smart!

207
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,237
I see what you mean.

208
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:12,637
There are some police officers in Japan

209
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:15,737
that refer to the police cars as pandas.

210
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:19,337
but didn't you say the victim is an American of English descent?

211
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,337
It's hard to imagine a foreigner would know

212
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:24,037
jargon Japanese police officers use.

213
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,637
And besides, it doesn't necessarily have to be a police car,

214
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:28,637
it could be a round, white car with black tires and rims

215
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:32,237
that would make you think of a panda too, wouldn't it?

216
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:33,637
Maybe.

217
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,637
In fact, that would be more panda-like

218
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:37,337
to a foreigner than a police car.

219
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:41,137
No. The victim James Black was raised in London,

220
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,237
that's why he would visualize a panda.

221
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,737
-What? -A long time ago,

222
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:48,837
police cars in England were painted black and white too.

223
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,837
-What? -In 1965,

224
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,637
the police department in Lancaster, England

225
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,337
was the first to paint black and white

226
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:57,737
and they gave them the nickname panda.

227
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,537
The nickname stuck and in England,

228
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:02,537
police cars are known as pandas.

229
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:05,737
The word "panda car" is even listed in the English dictionary.

230
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:10,337
I don't think the younger generation would know that though,

231
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:13,337
but Mr. James's generation

232
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:17,737
would immediately associate police car with panda.

233
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,737
I see.

234
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:22,437
What generation are you, anyway?

235
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:24,937
I just remembered.

236
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,337
I let a police car go through without checking it.

237
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:28,437
What?

238
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:31,837
But I don't think there was a foreigner inside.

239
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:34,537
The officer in the car. Didn't he seem strange?

240
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:37,037
Let's see. There were two detectives,

241
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,237
the suspect was in the back seat sitting between them,

242
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:42,037
his head was covered with a coat...

243
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,837
That's them!

244
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,245
That was so easy! So easy!

245
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,745
We're right on schedule.

246
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,945
We'll be deep in the mountains of Gunma by nightfall.

247
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:15,945
You were right. Your plan's working out perfect.

248
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,445
We can't let our guard down yet.

249
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:19,545
Didn't you think it was strange?

250
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:21,545
That female cop was just supposed to be directing traffic

251
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:25,045
but she looked into each and every car.

252
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:29,545
Hey, don't tell me that the cops are already on to us?

253
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,545
There's nothing to worry about.

254
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,745
We've got a hostage.

255
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,245
We've got to be prepared for anything

256
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:38,645
so keep your gun pressed to this guys throat.

257
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,945
And if they set up another roadblock or something...

258
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:44,445
We're going to crash our way through.

259
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:06,045
Hey, Sato. We're going to be in big trouble.

260
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,845
We've entered Saitama prefecture.

261
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:12,645
We've already asked the Saitama police to set up a roadblock.

262
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,645
So we don't have to keep going after them.

263
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:18,645
-Aren't you worried, Takagi? -Huh?

264
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:21,945
Yumi's checked that police car once.

265
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:23,745
They might have figured out already

266
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:25,545
that their cover's been blown

267
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,645
so they might use their hostage as a shield

268
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:28,145
and break through the roadblock.

269
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,545
Another thing. When Yumi looked inside,

270
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:34,645
she said the hostage didn't move at all.

271
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:38,945
So there's a high possibility the kidnappers are armed.

272
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,445
Wait a minute!

273
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:44,245
If they have guns and they see a roadblock,

274
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:47,845
they might start shooting at everything in sight.

275
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,645
The city's going to be in a panic!

276
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:54,845
That's why I've been trying to think up a plan

277
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,845
where we can surround the kidnappers without them knowing

278
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:59,345
and then take them in.

279
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:02,845
But then we'd need a miracle.

280
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,045
I think there's a way.

281
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:07,845
What? Conan?

282
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,145
The kids detective badge?

283
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,545
Sorry! I put it in your car when you weren't looking.

284
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,945
And where are you now?

285
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:19,245
About 500 meters behind your car.

286
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,545
So how? I've got a great plan, do you want to try it?

287
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:25,845
The only thing is this plan will work

288
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:28,845
only if a lot of other police officers

289
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:31,845
go along with my crazy idea.

290
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:38,045
Good grief. What's the matter with me?

291
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:40,345
What am I doing way out here?

292
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,045
Yumi? You following me?

293
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,645
Yes, I am. Do I have a choice?

294
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:49,945
I mean, I made a mistake and let those kidnappers get away.

295
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:52,545
Yumi, weren't you in charge of all the arrangements

296
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,045
when we had that get together with the Saitama police the other time?

297
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:58,045
What? Yes, I was.

298
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,345
Gosh! Another red light!

299
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:06,445
Don't get impatient. Just drive normally

300
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:08,345
and we won't draw any attention to ourselves.

301
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:10,445
We'll be safe once it gets dark.

302
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,545
Oh, crap! It's the cops!

303
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,245
I guess they're on to us!

304
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,545
Come on! Get going!

305
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,445
We'll make a run for it, we'll use him as a cover!

306
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:35,845
Yeah, okay!

307
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:41,845
Help me!

308
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,445
What's going on?

309
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,745
-Officer! -Please help us!

310
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:54,045
Excuse me! I'm Takagi from headquarters!

311
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:57,245
Please help us apprehend that kidnapper!

312
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,845
Gosh. Don't make a sound.

313
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,045
All right. We'll go along with them for a little while

314
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:03,545
then turn off into a side road when the coast's clear!

315
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:05,045
Got you!

316
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,645
Good. They fell for it!

317
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:12,745
Well? Is it working?

318
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:15,145
Just fine! It's going just fine!

319
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,445
Don't worry about it.

320
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,545
Get ready.

321
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,445
We're going to turn into a side road soon.

322
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,145
Hey! Why are you going so slow?

323
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,345
They're going to get away!

324
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,645
If you can't turn left, turn into the right!

325
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,445
But...

326
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,645
there's another one on the right.

327
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,145
All right then, we'll go back!

328
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,545
Slow down and then back up.

329
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,345
It's no good.

330
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,345
There's another one behind us too.

331
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,845
What?

332
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:56,545
Hey! We're completely surrounded by cops!

333
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,345
Darn it!

334
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:03,745
Nice going, Irregulars.

335
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:07,245
Or should I say "Holmes"?

336
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:10,345
Darn the cops! They set us up!

337
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:14,745
Never mind. We've got a hostage.

338
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:17,645
It's no use.

339
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:20,145
When someone gives the signal,

340
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:24,545
all the cars will stop at once.

341
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:33,745
By the time, the kidnappers regain their balance.

342
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:39,045
Put your hands up!

343
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,945
Your method was a little rough,

344
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:46,745
but it worked out perfect.

345
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:49,045
You're a real cool guy.

346
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,845
I want to thank all of you! You really helped us out!

347
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:55,645
Don't mention it! This was an easy job!

348
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:57,645
By the way, about our next get together...

349
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:58,645
I'll handle it!

350
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,645
I'll round up all the pretty single ones from headquarters.

351
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:04,945
I don't care, as long as Miss Sato's there...

352
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,545
Me, too.

353
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,045
I see.

354
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,645
Hey, Yumi.

355
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:12,545
Where's the victim, James Black?

356
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,345
Huh? He was right here just awhile ago.

357
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:17,245
Where'd he go?

358
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:20,045
I knew something was strange about that guy.

359
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:23,645
He disappeared before the police could question him.

360
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,645
I just know there's something behind this.

361
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:27,045
You think so?

362
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,345
He seemed like a pretty nice guy to me.

363
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,445
Only his name struck me as odd.

364
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:33,545
His name?

365
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,345
You don't mean because it was Black?

366
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:38,045
No. James.

367
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:41,645
Really? There's James Bond, James Dean...

368
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:44,945
I get a pretty good image from that name.

369
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,945
Professor James Moriarty.

370
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,845
The Napoleon of the criminal world.

371
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:56,845
Holmes' arch rival, Professor Moriarty.

372
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:59,145
James is his first name.

373
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:03,645
I guess only a Sherlockian would think of that though.

374
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,445
After all, James is a common name.

375
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,045
Yes, I suppose so.

376
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:12,245
Something else bothers me more though.

377
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:15,945
The man who was looking at us from that car.

378
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:19,045
He was one of the passengers on the bus that got hijacked.

379
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,845
I'm positive he said his name was Shuichi Akai

380
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,245
when he was questioned by the police.

381
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:56,645
That was something.

382
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:59,545
Leaving a code like that when you were taken by surprise.

383
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,545
When'd you realize they weren't real cops?

384
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,745
When they spoke to me in Japanese,

385
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:10,545
it was as if they knew I understood.

386
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,045
If they were detectives

387
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:16,245
and if they knew I was a foreigner who could speak Japanese,

388
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:19,045
then they'd have confirmed my name in the very beginning.

389
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,645
That's what tipped me off.

390
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:23,745
I thought they knew who I really was

391
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:27,945
but were pretending not to, that's what made me suspicious.

392
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:31,345
Well, it seems it was a case of mistaken identity though.

393
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,445
But what a surprise.

394
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:37,245
I never thought you'd cut off your long hair.

395
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,245
I want to change my luck.

396
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,745
My girlfriend keeps leaving me.

397
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,245
Is that so?

398
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:47,745
You went out of your way to get me here.

399
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:52,245
So does that mean you have a chance of getting back with her?

400
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:56,245
Sort of. I want to get back at her.

401
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:58,945
For dumping me.

402
00:23:58,945 --> 00:24:00,745
I want her to cry tears of blood.

403
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,345
"Next Episode"

404
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:13,045
Why's there blood here?

405
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:19,745
Wow. He's done it again, and he's awake this time!

406
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,245
What?

407
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:29,145
So, that's it. Amazing!

408
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:35,245
Next Conan, "The Rocking Restaurant"

409
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:38,063
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:38,063 --> 00:24:40,163
"Fish scale"

411
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,463
The next case takes place in a mysterious restaurant.

412
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:45,263
It sure is different!
