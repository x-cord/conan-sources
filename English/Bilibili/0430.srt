1
00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.767
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.667
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:06.167
The locked door mystery of a car

4
00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:07.567
that is sealed tightly with masking tape from the inside,

5
00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.267
won't even let a tangled love affair through.

6
00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.767
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.567
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.367
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:58.677
After the battle with the Black Organization,

10
00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:00.977
we are leading a peaceful everyday life.

11
00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:04.577
Then, a new student who looks just like Kir

12
00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:07.277
of the Black Organization comes to Ran's class.

13
00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:09.177
His name is Eisuke Hondo.

14
00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:12.777
Well, he turns out to be a great fan of Pops

15
00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:14.577
and an ordinary high school klutz.

16
00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:19.677
Just then, a client comes in asking Pops to look for a runaway girl.

17
00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:22.077
And?

18
00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:26.477
Did you two really meet on this freezing mountain?

19
00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:27.977
On the other side of that tree!

20
00:02:27.977 --> 00:02:29.377
That's my car!

21
00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:31.577
Ami? Ami?

22
00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:35.777
The door is sealed tight from the inside of the car with masking tape.

23
00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:38.677
There is a portable charcoal stove by the passenger's seat

24
00:02:38.677 --> 00:02:41.077
with burned remains of solid fuel.

25
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:45.577
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning,

26
00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:47.977
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

27
00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:51.177
There's no doubt that she committed suicide.

28
00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:52.177
No.

29
00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:55.477
This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

30
00:02:55.477 --> 00:02:58.377
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

31
00:02:58.377 --> 00:02:59.377
that man.

32
00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:06.477
"The Point of No Return (Part 2)"

33
00:03:07.077 --> 00:03:09.177
So it's suicide.

34
00:03:09.177 --> 00:03:11.777
I guess it can't be helped then.

35
00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:15.377
We will have you come in for interrogation at a later date,

36
00:03:15.377 --> 00:03:16.377
so we'll call it a...

37
00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:21.577
Hey, are you all right?

38
00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:24.777
Yeah, I just tripped over uneven ground.

39
00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:30.977
What is this hollow part?

40
00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:36.277
From the size of it,

41
00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:38.777
looks like a car was parked here.

42
00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:41.477
Strange. I wonder who parked here?

43
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:43.377
It looks to be just about the size the rental car

44
00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:46.177
of the man with the mustache that we drove here in.

45
00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:51.977
By the way, when did you borrow the rental car?

46
00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:53.977
From last night.

47
00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:56.477
After the fight last night,

48
00:03:56.477 --> 00:04:00.277
she said she needed to use the car very badly today,

49
00:04:00.277 --> 00:04:02.377
so I rushed to rent a car

50
00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:05.377
because I needed to use the car today, too.

51
00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:07.477
I had no idea that she was going to use the car

52
00:04:07.477 --> 00:04:09.477
for something like this though.

53
00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:12.777
You must be a super scatterbrain, sir.

54
00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:15.677
If you knew that she was going to take the car,

55
00:04:15.677 --> 00:04:18.877
why did you leave your important company papers inside?

56
00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:25.077
I was thinking of taking it out in the morning.

57
00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:28.377
What is it? The important papers of the company?

58
00:04:28.377 --> 00:04:32.177
Some documents that he has to submit to the company tomorrow.

59
00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:34.177
He hired me to find his girlfriend who disappeared

60
00:04:34.177 --> 00:04:37.977
because he needed those papers back.

61
00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:40.177
But did you find them?

62
00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:42.977
No. I was more concerned about her, so...

63
00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:44.477
Now that you mentioned it, the documents...

64
00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:50.377
Excuse me, did you find any documents in the car?

65
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:54.377
Yeah, there was an envelope in the backseat of the car.

66
00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.177
Yes. That's it, that's it.

67
00:04:57.177 --> 00:05:00.477
So you found it. I'm glad.

68
00:05:00.477 --> 00:05:01.577
Come to think of it,

69
00:05:01.577 --> 00:05:06.177
a bag that is thought to be the woman's was also in the car.

70
00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:07.777
This was in her bag, too.

71
00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:11.677
This is a cigarette lighter.

72
00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:17.477
Why would something like that be in her bag?

73
00:05:17.477 --> 00:05:18.777
Who knows?

74
00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:22.077
We can tell that she put it in her bag today,

75
00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:24.777
because there was a burnt trace of the cigarette lighter

76
00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:27.677
on the novel that went on sale today inside her bag, too.

77
00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:29.177
But for some reason,

78
00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:32.677
there are no fingerprints whatsoever on that novel.

79
00:05:33.777 --> 00:05:36.377
This is getting weirder by the minute.

80
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:38.377
She hated cigarettes

81
00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:41.377
and used to always hide it to keep me, who is a heavy smoker

82
00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:43.177
from smoking in the car.

83
00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.577
Maybe she just did it out of habit.

84
00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:48.277
You're a heavy smoker?

85
00:05:48.277 --> 00:05:50.477
Yes.

86
00:05:50.477 --> 00:05:53.677
May I go take a puff in the rented car?

87
00:05:53.677 --> 00:05:57.077
I was refraining from smoking because of the circumstances.

88
00:05:57.077 --> 00:05:58.177
Yeah.

89
00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:01.177
Cigarettes.

90
00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:05.077
Wait a second.

91
00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:08.977
Maybe...

92
00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:11.777
Hey!

93
00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:20.677
Just as I thought.

94
00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:25.977
The killer is Mr. Misumi. There's no doubt about it.

95
00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.177
Hey.

96
00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:30.477
All I need to figure out now is the trick.

97
00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:35.877
It hurts...

98
00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:37.877
Are you all right, Eisuke?

99
00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:39.077
See.

100
00:06:39.077 --> 00:06:42.677
The first one to slip and fall at times like this is me.

101
00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:45.277
Hey, your finger is bleeding!

102
00:06:46.577 --> 00:06:50.577
It's probably from a shard that came from the front glass.

103
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.877
Wait. I have a bandage.

104
00:06:53.877 --> 00:06:54.977
Show me your finger.

105
00:06:57.277 --> 00:06:58.277
Okay.

106
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:13.377
It'll heal right away if you put spit on it!

107
00:07:13.377 --> 00:07:16.077
But I think bandage should be used, just in case.

108
00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:19.277
Put it on yourself.

109
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:27.077
Bandage is really something, isn't it?

110
00:07:27.077 --> 00:07:28.277
Why?

111
00:07:28.277 --> 00:07:32.977
It helps the wound that is cut open close up in an instant.

112
00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:36.377
Look. It's like there was never a wound to begin with.

113
00:07:39.977 --> 00:07:40.977
Wait a second.

114
00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:42.577
Don't tell me that the masking tape...

115
00:07:42.577 --> 00:07:45.877
Forensic officer.

116
00:07:45.877 --> 00:07:47.277
Not you again.

117
00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:49.477
I seemed to have forgotten something in the car

118
00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:51.977
when I went in a while ago.

119
00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:53.377
May I go get it?

120
00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:54.477
Hey, kid!

121
00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:00.777
I see.

122
00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:02.777
So that's the story.

123
00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:06.977
Suicide.

124
00:08:06.977 --> 00:08:08.777
It was suicide.

125
00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.577
But...

126
00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:13.177
The car that Ami was in

127
00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:16.777
was sealed tightly from the inside with masking tape.

128
00:08:16.777 --> 00:08:17.977
And on the floor of the passenger's seat

129
00:08:17.977 --> 00:08:22.177
were the burnt remains of solid fuel inside a portable charcoal stove.

130
00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:24.777
That's why a deduction show by the Sleeping Kogoro

131
00:08:24.777 --> 00:08:26.777
is not necessary in this case!

132
00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:28.977
I guess so.

133
00:08:28.977 --> 00:08:30.677
Too bad.

134
00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:34.677
What do you mean?

135
00:08:34.677 --> 00:08:37.777
You should be glad that this wasn't a homicide.

136
00:08:37.777 --> 00:08:40.377
But everyone at the station is looking forward

137
00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:42.977
to watch the video of the Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:45.177
Can't anything be done about it?

139
00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:46.977
What do you mean by that?

140
00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:49.177
Pops!

141
00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:50.177
What is it?

142
00:08:50.177 --> 00:08:52.477
I noticed something,

143
00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:53.677
so will you come with me for a second?

144
00:08:55.477 --> 00:08:56.477
What is it?

145
00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:00.477
Pops! The door of this car.

146
00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:02.677
Don't you think it's strange?

147
00:09:02.677 --> 00:09:03.977
Not really.

148
00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:07.377
The masking tape is cut, that's all.

149
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.277
Is something the matter?

150
00:09:23.477 --> 00:09:27.677
That all absorbing attitude as if to despise everyone is indeed

151
00:09:27.677 --> 00:09:29.077
the Sleeping Kogoro!

152
00:09:30.777 --> 00:09:33.377
"As if to despise everyone" is a needless remark.

153
00:09:33.377 --> 00:09:35.977
But you're posing like that means...

154
00:09:35.977 --> 00:09:37.577
You are...

155
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.677
Yeah.

156
00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:42.677
I'm going to show you the deduction of the Sleeping Kogoro right now.

157
00:09:43.577 --> 00:09:44.977
-All right! -All right!

158
00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:47.077
But before that,

159
00:09:47.077 --> 00:09:49.977
bring the most important person involved in this case,

160
00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:53.977
Misumi, the boyfriend of the victim here.

161
00:10:13.882 --> 00:10:17.182
What? Detective Mouri's deduction show?

162
00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:18.382
Ridiculous.

163
00:10:18.382 --> 00:10:20.782
Ami committed suicide, didn't she?

164
00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:22.982
What on earth is he going to deduce?

165
00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:24.982
I agree with you.

166
00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:27.682
I've got a whole lot to deduce.

167
00:10:27.682 --> 00:10:30.982
After all, this is a homicide made to look like a suicide.

168
00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:32.482
Homicide?

169
00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:33.982
What?

170
00:10:33.982 --> 00:10:36.682
Yeah. Moreover, the killer

171
00:10:36.682 --> 00:10:39.482
is the one who cracked the glass and went into the car to rescue Ami.

172
00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:42.582
He cut the masking tape off and opened the car up.

173
00:10:42.582 --> 00:10:44.382
Mr. Atsushi Misumi,

174
00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:45.982
I'm talking about you!

175
00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:50.182
Is that so?

176
00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.782
What an unexpected deduction!

177
00:10:53.382 --> 00:10:56.782
Look. That's the Sleeping Kogoro.

178
00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:58.982
He's just looking down and talking

179
00:10:58.982 --> 00:11:01.382
and there's no God descended on him, is there?

180
00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:05.882
Yes, but...

181
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:07.782
Doesn't it bother you?

182
00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:09.182
What?

183
00:11:09.182 --> 00:11:10.782
Next to Mr. Mouri...

184
00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:14.782
That boy who is behind the car.

185
00:11:14.782 --> 00:11:16.882
Oh, you mean Conan?

186
00:11:16.882 --> 00:11:19.882
He often helps dad out during his deduction,

187
00:11:19.882 --> 00:11:21.482
so he's probably standing by.

188
00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:27.382
Please stop kidding, Mr. Mouri.

189
00:11:27.382 --> 00:11:31.982
But I'm the very one who asked you to look for her, you know?

190
00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:34.082
Then why would I...

191
00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:37.382
Because you had your reasons for needing to do so.

192
00:11:37.382 --> 00:11:42.182
You had to in order to make it look like she sealed herself in the car.

193
00:11:42.182 --> 00:11:44.382
To make it look like?

194
00:11:44.382 --> 00:11:45.982
With all due respect, Mr. Mouri,

195
00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:49.082
I think that this car was sealed from the inside.

196
00:11:49.082 --> 00:11:50.582
Even the forensic officers said that the masking tape

197
00:11:50.582 --> 00:11:54.782
was sealed on tightly that it was difficult to tear them off.

198
00:11:54.782 --> 00:11:56.482
That's definitely true.

199
00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:59.282
But that only goes for the masking tape on the driver's seat side.

200
00:11:59.282 --> 00:12:02.382
Nobody even thought that a slit had been made to begin with

201
00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:06.082
in the masking tape on the passenger's seat side.

202
00:12:06.082 --> 00:12:07.682
What the...

203
00:12:07.682 --> 00:12:10.782
But you were watching him cut the masking tape of the door

204
00:12:10.782 --> 00:12:14.582
with a cutter knife, weren't you?

205
00:12:14.582 --> 00:12:17.082
Yeah, I was.

206
00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:21.382
I saw him undo the tape on the door by pressing on it,

207
00:12:21.382 --> 00:12:25.582
and very skilfully cut the tape by pressing down on the tape.

208
00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:30.182
Tape that was very lightly sealed?

209
00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:34.182
First, Mr. Misumi brings his girlfriend here with his car.

210
00:12:34.182 --> 00:12:36.082
On his way here, he put her to sleep

211
00:12:36.082 --> 00:12:38.882
with the sleeping drug that was inserted in the canned coffee.

212
00:12:38.882 --> 00:12:42.882
Then, he carried her up and made her sit on the driver's seat

213
00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:47.382
and seals all the doors of the car with masking tape from the inside.

214
00:12:47.382 --> 00:12:50.982
Then he cuts the masking tape on the passenger's seat side

215
00:12:50.982 --> 00:12:54.282
following the line that joins the body of the car and the door.

216
00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:57.482
He opens the door and seals vertically cut masking tape

217
00:12:57.482 --> 00:13:02.382
over the masking tape on the body of the car.

218
00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:05.782
He then burns solid fuel in the portable charcoal stove

219
00:13:05.782 --> 00:13:07.382
that is placed under the passenger's seat,

220
00:13:07.382 --> 00:13:10.382
goes out and closes the door to complete his task.

221
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:15.782
He finally goes to the car that he had brought here beforehand

222
00:13:15.782 --> 00:13:17.482
and leaves here for a while.

223
00:13:17.482 --> 00:13:20.182
He brings someone here so that they can see

224
00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:26.282
that the masking tape on the driver's seat side is sealed on tightly.

225
00:13:26.282 --> 00:13:28.882
After that, he cracks the windshield and goes into the car

226
00:13:28.882 --> 00:13:30.982
to cut the lightly sealed masking tape

227
00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:33.882
by pressing it along with his hand.

228
00:13:33.882 --> 00:13:37.782
The locked room homicide is completed.

229
00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:39.382
I see!

230
00:13:39.382 --> 00:13:42.182
If you want to save someone on the driver's seat side,

231
00:13:42.182 --> 00:13:45.782
it's most natural to try and open the door on the driver's seat side.

232
00:13:45.782 --> 00:13:47.182
Even from the driver's side,

233
00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:51.782
you could see that there was tape on each side of the door.

234
00:13:51.782 --> 00:13:54.282
If the masking tape is cut by pressing down on it,

235
00:13:54.282 --> 00:13:55.882
it will adhere

236
00:13:55.882 --> 00:13:57.382
and even if it is checked later,

237
00:13:57.382 --> 00:14:00.882
it would go unnoticed that only the tape there was sealed on lightly.

238
00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.082
Yeah.

239
00:14:03.082 --> 00:14:06.982
Please take a look at the cut part of the masking tape

240
00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:08.482
that is sealed onto the passenger's seat side.

241
00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:09.682
The cut part?

242
00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:13.382
The cut part of the masking tape sealed horizontally and vertically

243
00:14:13.382 --> 00:14:14.982
is out of place, isn't it?

244
00:14:14.982 --> 00:14:17.782
After cutting the horizontally sealed masking tape once,

245
00:14:17.782 --> 00:14:19.382
another masking tape was vertically sealed on over it.

246
00:14:19.382 --> 00:14:21.882
That's evidence that he cut it twice.

247
00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:24.182
That's true.

248
00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:27.182
Which means that the driver's seat was pulled back

249
00:14:27.182 --> 00:14:29.982
and the crease in the top of her clothes were...

250
00:14:29.982 --> 00:14:34.482
Yeah, it proves that Mr. Misumi is the one who drove here

251
00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:38.382
and moved her over to the driver's seat.

252
00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:40.482
Please wait a minute.

253
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:42.282
All I was trying to do

254
00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:45.882
was get my girlfriend out of the car as soon as possible.

255
00:14:45.882 --> 00:14:50.282
How offending that my actions would be interpreted that way.

256
00:14:50.282 --> 00:14:52.582
You don't even have proof that I did it either.

257
00:14:52.582 --> 00:14:54.282
Proof?

258
00:14:54.282 --> 00:14:56.682
There is a very concrete proof.

259
00:14:56.682 --> 00:14:59.182
The ashtray inside the car.

260
00:14:59.182 --> 00:15:00.482
Huh?

261
00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:05.782
Remember that cigarette lighter in her bag?

262
00:15:05.782 --> 00:15:11.182
It was not only to keep Mr. Misumi from smoking inside this car,

263
00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:16.582
but also to keep something else from his view until she got off the car.

264
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:19.582
That is, the message of farewell

265
00:15:19.582 --> 00:15:21.282
that she hid in the ashtray.

266
00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:24.282
Let's see.

267
00:15:24.282 --> 00:15:26.982
"I guess you want to take me to the place where we first met

268
00:15:26.982 --> 00:15:30.182
to get back how we felt for each other before,

269
00:15:30.182 --> 00:15:32.882
but I've changed.

270
00:15:32.882 --> 00:15:34.282
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:35.982
Ami."

272
00:15:35.982 --> 00:15:39.282
Which means that she's the one who changed.

273
00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:44.182
And you're the one who brought her to the place you both first met.

274
00:15:44.182 --> 00:15:47.282
If the one who wrote this is the victim,

275
00:15:47.282 --> 00:15:48.782
this would serve as proof.

276
00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.882
It's a trap! This is a trap that Ami set up!

277
00:15:51.882 --> 00:15:55.382
She made it look like I killed her and committed suicide!

278
00:15:55.382 --> 00:15:56.882
Even for the slit in the masking tape,

279
00:15:56.882 --> 00:15:59.582
if she assumed that I would use the cutter knife,

280
00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:02.282
she could've put it into the dashboard beforehand.

281
00:16:02.282 --> 00:16:05.882
And as for that message, she could've written it to frame me.

282
00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.482
The message is not proof.

283
00:16:08.482 --> 00:16:12.382
The point is the book cover with the message written on it.

284
00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:15.382
As you can see,

285
00:16:15.382 --> 00:16:18.682
that is a paper cover that the bookshop covers the book with.

286
00:16:18.682 --> 00:16:20.982
It was probably from the book that was released today

287
00:16:20.982 --> 00:16:24.882
that was found inside her bag.

288
00:16:24.882 --> 00:16:30.682
No fingerprints were found on that book because you wiped them off.

289
00:16:30.682 --> 00:16:32.282
You did this because your fingerprints

290
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:36.282
would be on it after giving it to her.

291
00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:42.982
However, it seems you absentmindedly forgot and didn't wipe everything off.

292
00:16:42.982 --> 00:16:48.382
That is, the fingerprints on the book cover that she wrote the message on

293
00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.482
and secretly hid in the ashtray.

294
00:16:51.482 --> 00:16:53.982
Now, I'd like to ask you.

295
00:16:53.982 --> 00:16:55.582
If you woke up this morning

296
00:16:55.582 --> 00:16:57.682
and found that she had left along with the car,

297
00:16:57.682 --> 00:16:59.482
how can there be your fingerprints

298
00:16:59.482 --> 00:17:03.782
on the book cover that was released today?

299
00:17:03.782 --> 00:17:09.482
But you can't tell if the cover came from that book that was in her bag.

300
00:17:09.482 --> 00:17:14.282
Books are all different sizes, even if they belong to the same series.

301
00:17:14.282 --> 00:17:18.782
A cover that matches the exact size is very rare.

302
00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:20.282
If you want, shall we go together to the book store,

303
00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:23.282
which address is written on the cover?

304
00:17:23.282 --> 00:17:26.482
I'm sure they'll testify

305
00:17:26.482 --> 00:17:28.582
that the man who bought the book this morning had bloodshot eyes,

306
00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:31.482
haunted by the crime he was planning to commit.

307
00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:33.582
In other words, you.

308
00:17:40.182 --> 00:17:42.682
Bloodshot eyes?

309
00:17:42.682 --> 00:17:46.782
Wrong, Mr. Detective.

310
00:17:46.782 --> 00:17:50.382
I must've looked sad and wretched.

311
00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:55.182
Because I figured that it was the last wish from the woman I loved.

312
00:17:55.182 --> 00:17:59.482
So you did get the novel that she asked you for.

313
00:17:59.482 --> 00:18:00.682
Yes.

314
00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:05.582
Just as you expect, my fingerprints are on the book cover.

315
00:18:05.582 --> 00:18:08.682
I've always done as she asked.

316
00:18:08.682 --> 00:18:14.382
Yes, I granted her every wish just as she wanted me to.

317
00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:16.282
If she told me she wanted to go on a trip,

318
00:18:16.282 --> 00:18:18.382
I would take time off from work and take her.

319
00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:20.782
If she told me she wanted to see a popular concert,

320
00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:23.482
I would stand in line all night and get her a premier ticket.

321
00:18:24.782 --> 00:18:26.782
The same with this car.

322
00:18:26.782 --> 00:18:28.882
She said that she wanted to drive it,

323
00:18:28.882 --> 00:18:31.682
so I bought it despite having to borrow money.

324
00:18:31.682 --> 00:18:36.582
Yes. I felt as if I were her prince.

325
00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:40.582
But I finally realized that I had made a mistake.

326
00:18:40.582 --> 00:18:43.482
She didn't consider me her prince.

327
00:18:43.482 --> 00:18:45.782
I was no more than a servant to her.

328
00:18:45.782 --> 00:18:48.282
A servant?

329
00:18:48.282 --> 00:18:50.882
I found a cigarette in the car.

330
00:18:50.882 --> 00:18:53.382
It was a brand that I don't use.

331
00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:57.082
She never let me smoke one cigarette when I rode with her.

332
00:18:57.082 --> 00:18:59.282
Don't tell me that she was cheating on you?

333
00:18:59.282 --> 00:19:00.682
Yes.

334
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:01.982
When I pressed her for an answer,

335
00:19:01.982 --> 00:19:07.282
she confessed that she used to often go driving with that guy in this car.

336
00:19:07.282 --> 00:19:10.582
She even laughed about it!

337
00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:13.782
I felt really stupid

338
00:19:13.782 --> 00:19:16.682
thinking that I kept paying back the loan for the car

339
00:19:16.682 --> 00:19:19.182
for a guy I didn't even know.

340
00:19:19.182 --> 00:19:22.482
Is that why you committed the crime?

341
00:19:22.482 --> 00:19:24.282
Yes.

342
00:19:24.282 --> 00:19:25.682
But please believe me!

343
00:19:25.682 --> 00:19:29.382
Officer, I really loved her!

344
00:19:29.382 --> 00:19:32.682
I didn't come here just to commit the crime!

345
00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:35.282
It was for her as well.

346
00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:37.082
I was full of regret.

347
00:19:37.082 --> 00:19:40.882
I wished that she were still alive.

348
00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:43.982
That's why I cracked the windshield with the metal bat with all my might.

349
00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:45.582
Okay, that's enough.

350
00:19:49.282 --> 00:19:53.182
I don't know what went on between you and her,

351
00:19:53.182 --> 00:19:57.682
but one thing for sure is that, the "love" between you both was gone.

352
00:19:57.682 --> 00:19:58.782
What?

353
00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:02.482
If you really wanted to save her,

354
00:20:02.482 --> 00:20:03.882
you would've intuitively carefully cracked the rear window

355
00:20:03.882 --> 00:20:09.282
or the side window on the passenger's seat side from behind.

356
00:20:09.282 --> 00:20:14.082
But you broke through the front window,

357
00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:18.082
because you knew that the glass shards would cut her.

358
00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:24.182
You already knew that she was dead.

359
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:26.682
You wanted to crush everything, didn't you?

360
00:20:26.682 --> 00:20:30.682
The memories together with her along with this car.

361
00:22:03.982 --> 00:22:06.882
Well, just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

362
00:22:06.882 --> 00:22:09.782
The great deduction that echoed throughout the snowy mountains of Gunma!

363
00:22:09.782 --> 00:22:13.382
I'm going back to the station and watch the video right away.

364
00:22:13.382 --> 00:22:15.282
Suit yourself.

365
00:22:15.282 --> 00:22:18.082
I don't remember a thing.

366
00:22:18.082 --> 00:22:20.082
This is how I land up after all.

367
00:22:20.082 --> 00:22:21.482
What?

368
00:22:21.482 --> 00:22:23.682
Only the first part is taken.

369
00:22:25.082 --> 00:22:26.382
I see!

370
00:22:26.382 --> 00:22:29.682
I was shooting the film using pause to save tape.

371
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.982
So he forgot to turn pause off.

372
00:22:32.982 --> 00:22:35.982
Mr. Mouri, why don't we go back for a retake?

373
00:22:37.682 --> 00:22:39.282
What an idiot.

374
00:22:39.282 --> 00:22:44.082
But this case was solved thanks to Eisuke.

375
00:22:44.082 --> 00:22:47.182
Because you mentioned about the bandage.

376
00:22:47.182 --> 00:22:50.982
Then, Conan noticed that the masking tape on the car was strange

377
00:22:50.982 --> 00:22:53.182
and went to tell dad about it, right?

378
00:22:54.982 --> 00:22:56.282
Sort of.

379
00:22:56.282 --> 00:22:59.082
You were outdone in your own forte, weren't you?

380
00:22:59.082 --> 00:23:00.282
Huh?

381
00:23:00.282 --> 00:23:02.182
In his own forte?

382
00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:04.582
It's usually this boy's role.

383
00:23:04.582 --> 00:23:07.182
He mentions something that seemingly has nothing to do with the case,

384
00:23:07.182 --> 00:23:10.682
but it coincidentally turns out to be the key to solving the case.

385
00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:11.682
Don't tell me...

386
00:23:13.882 --> 00:23:16.782
He does?

387
00:23:16.782 --> 00:23:18.082
Don't tell me...

388
00:23:21.582 --> 00:23:23.082
Don't tell me that he...

389
00:23:24.982 --> 00:23:28.182
Well, if you want to see the Sleeping Kogoro again,

390
00:23:28.182 --> 00:23:30.982
you can come over anytime you like.

391
00:23:30.982 --> 00:23:31.982
Really?

392
00:23:33.082 --> 00:23:35.082
I did it!

393
00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:37.382
Ouch...

394
00:23:40.782 --> 00:23:42.282
I guess not.

395
00:23:44.782 --> 00:23:46.582
"Next Episode" -Singles party?

396
00:23:50.482 --> 00:23:53.382
The atmosphere doesn't look too good, does it?

397
00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:55.282
It's starting to get interesting.

398
00:23:55.282 --> 00:23:57.282
Is he your younger brother?

399
00:24:00.082 --> 00:24:03.882
And if the culprit cannot find what he is after,

400
00:24:03.882 --> 00:24:05.482
the next action he would take is...

401
00:24:07.282 --> 00:24:08.282
A kidnapping.

402
00:24:09.382 --> 00:24:14.782
Next Conan, "Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 1)"

403
00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:18.067
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:19.767
"Rare card"

405
00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:21.167
Give me that card, Mitsuhiko.

406
00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:23.067
-No way. -I want it, too!

407
00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:24.267
Here you go.
