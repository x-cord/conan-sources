1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,550
Mystery-solving logic will moisten
hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,650
Today's the marvelous movie world!

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,770
A crime occurs in
the beast's shadow!

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,760
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,020
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:38,669
The Giant Monster Gomera Murder Case.

8
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,869
Cut!

9
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,959
Ok!

10
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,259
Totally cool!

11
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,449
It's the real Gomera!

12
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,119
He truly is incredible!

13
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,039
He looks so strong!

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,719
It's been a while, Agasa!

15
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,539
Oh, Mikami-kun!

16
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,579
Are these the ones who wanted to watch?

17
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:10,709
Yes.

18
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,199
Who's he?

19
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:18,069
This is Director Mikami-kun,
my friend and creator of Gomera!

20
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:18,539
Movie Director - Daisuke Mikami
This is Director Mikami-kun,
my friend and creator of Gomera!

21
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,499
Nice to meet ya, kids!
Movie Director - Daisuke Mikami

22

Movie Director - Daisuke Mikami

23
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,039
Say, would you like
to see Gomera close up?

24
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,869
Can we?!

25
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:30,789
Yeah, it's break time for a while.

26
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,289
Yay!

27
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,929
These buildings are tiny!

28
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,139
Hey, look at that!

29
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,099
Gomera's back is open!

30
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,319
A person was born from Gomera!

31
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,529
That's just a suit.
They film it to make it look like

32
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,619
the monster is rampaging
throughout this miniature city.

33
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,159
These buildings sure are well-made...

34
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,579
Keep your filthy hands off, you brats!

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,789
Art - Ryota Adachi
Wreck the set and

36
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,419
you'll have heck to pay!
Art - Ryota Adachi

37
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,659
Director! Do something
about these kids!

38
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,799
Now, now...

39
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,139
Would you like me

40
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:13,369
Gomera Actor - Shugo Matsui
Would you like me

41
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:15,329
to watch them for you?
Gomera Actor - Shugo Matsui

42
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,329
I don't have any scenes
Gomera Actor - Shugo Matsui

43
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,759
until this afternoon.
Gomera Actor - Shugo Matsui

44
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,959
I appreciate it, Matsui-kun.

45
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,539
He's a nice guy!

46
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,519
Gomera is on kids' sides!

47
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,479
Gomera always rampages
because of bad adults, after all!

48
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,719
And it's Emela the fairy who

49
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,329
Actress - Tomomi Sakaguchi
And it's Emela the fairy who

50
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,449
quiets Gomera's rage, children!
Actress - Tomomi Sakaguchi

51
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,409
Emela? The ring fairy who comes
out only when there's trouble?!

52
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,659
That's right!

53
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,379
Yeah, right! Emela's this tiny!

54
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,119
She looks just like her.

55
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,889
But isn't she a little old?

56
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,829
Hush, you!

57
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:54,789
This is a nice staff you have.

58
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:57,129
Yes. They all love Gomera,

59
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:01,049
and they're like a family that's
worked with Gomera for ten years.

60
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,019
That will end this year.

61
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:04,319
Monster movies are puerile.

62
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,539
Movie Producer - Osamu Kamei
Monster movies are puerile.

63
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,599
Their time is over.
Movie Producer - Osamu Kamei

64
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,319
Worn-out music
and tedious direction.

65
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,409
Over-expensive
sets and special effects.

66
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,249
The fairy that was 14
when she debuted is now 24.

67
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,029
It's time to end this.

68
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:26,499
Ah, yes. I hear yesterday's
rush film is done.

69
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,999
Go watch it in the screening room.

70
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,829
You're not going to watch?

71
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:37,049
No. Say, want to grab a bite?
There's still the matter to discuss.

72
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,509
No. I'll pass.

73
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,559
What matter to discuss?

74
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,459
It's about his next movie.

75
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,959
He asked me to be the
leading role as a policewoman.

76
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,439
How can he blame people
and then ask something like that?!

77
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,459
What's to complain about?
At least you got some work.

78
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,529
We're left out in the cold.
Right, Macchan?

79
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:05,329
No, he asked me
to be the villain...

80
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:06,999
So it's just me?

81
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:11,999
Whatever. Let's go
check out the majestic Gomera.

82
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,459
Alright, Matsui-kun.
The kids are all yours.

83
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,419
Storeroom â™ª1

84
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,409
Awesome!
Look at all these monsters!

85
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,639
They're all the ones
that Gomera beat!

86
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,329
Hey!

87
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,849
Sorry! I didn't think
you'd be that surprised!

88
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:31,119
What's with that hand?

89
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:34,039
It's Gomera's hand.
We use it in close-up shots.

90
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,829
There's also a remote-controlled face.
Wanna see it?

91
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,249
Yeah!

92
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,289
Just a sec while I get it!

93
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,279
Alright!

94
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,959
Are Gomera movies really
going to end? They're so good...

95
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,119
He did say it cost lots of money...

96
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,999
It must be the food costs!
Gomera is big!

97
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,209
What simpletons.

98
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,839
Matsui-san!

99
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,829
What happened to your leg?!

100
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,019
It's Gomera!

101
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:08,969
Gomera?!

102
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,309
He was in here! And he
stabbed me with a knife!

103
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:14,869
Where is he now?!

104
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,769
He ran out that door!

105
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,859
Hey, wait! Kids!

106
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,869
What is this place?

107
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:26,279
You can see the studio...

108
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:28,489
Oh? There's someone there!

109
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,949
Isn't he that producer?

110
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,629
Matsui-kun?

111
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,049
Hey, now!

112
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:56,939
Conan-kun!

113
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,399
Hold on!

114
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,359
Too late he's dead!

115
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:07,709
Footprints?! He escaped
through that door!

116
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:08,909
Hey! Conan!

117
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,999
Not you too!

118
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,459
Did you see Gomera?!

119
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,919
Right there. I just ran into him--

120
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,589
Wait! Was that Matsui-san?

121
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:27,339
Huh?

122
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,299
Gomera's not here.

123
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,429
That can't be! There's no
place to hide up here!

124
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,889
Maybe he flew off?

125
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,359
Genta-kun. Gomera can't fly.

126
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,279
It's on the ground!

127
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:43,939
Darn! A suicide?!

128
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:52,039
It's empty! That's impossible!

129
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:58,039
Pardon my asking, but where
were you at around 11:30 a.m.?

130
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,829
I was on the 1st floor of the studio,

131
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,339
doing the final
continuity checks alone.

132
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,119
So no one can vouch for you?

133
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:06,799
No...

134
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:10,229
You're really sweating a lot.

135
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,719
Yes, I tend to sweat quite a bit.

136
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,289
When you entered this storeroom,
the killer was in here,

137
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,869
already in the Gomera costume?

138
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:20,939
Yes...

139
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,119
Is he all right?!

140
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:27,859
I gave him emergency treatment,
but he needs to get to a hospital.

141
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,329
He couldn't have killed
him with that leg...

142
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,159
When the incident occurred,
why where you here?

143
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:42,619
I wanted Producer Kamei to see
the rush of the final Gomera movie.

144
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,789
It was really well done, so...

145
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:45,959
Rush?

146
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,089
Unedited film that was just recorded.

147
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:52,049
To think something
like this would happen...

148
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:57,579
Say, Tomomi-san. You saw the back
of the person in the suit, right?

149
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:02,189
Yes, but I'm not sure who it was.
But the way they ran...

150
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,049
The way they ran?

151
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,289
Yes. They had a hard time running.

152
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,959
Like they weren't used to wearing it...

153
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,819
But of course. That would be the
case for everyone but Matsui-kun.

154
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:19,789
In other words, everyone but
you three was in the screening room.

155
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,749
That's right. I watched the rush too.

156
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:24,459
Who are you?

157
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:29,169
Agasa! The genius inventor
who lives next door to Shinichi-kun!

158
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,829
Oh! I've heard about you!

159
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:35,289
You're always making
oddball inventions!

160
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:37,849
Why, you...

161
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:38,559
Now, now!

162
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:42,289
So was the entire staff
really in the screening room?

163
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,459
She's the only one that left.

164
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,569
Wait, there was
another who snuck out...

165
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,029
Who was it?!

166
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,119
I think it was--

167
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,459
I told you, I don't know
how this paint got here!

168
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,489
It was him!

169
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,459
Why would I put paint in
the middle of the set

170
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,959
when the taping was gonna
be this afternoon?!

171
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,419
Yeah, I snuck out.

172
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,129
I noticed something on the
set when I saw the rush.

173
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,959
Don't tell me you suspect me?

174
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,349
Adachi-san only snuck
out for four or five minutes.

175
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,869
That's not enough time to
don the suit, kill someone,

176
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,809
and return to the screening room
after running up the stairs.

177
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:27,269
Who put this paint here anyway?

178
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,249
You did.

179
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,489
Don't you remember?
You left it after the morning rehearsal.

180
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,519
Oh, yeah! I completely forgot!

181
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,209
Really, now!

182
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,669
Say, why didn't
Matsui-san watch the rush?

183
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:51,209
Don't ask me. All he said was
that he didn't wanna watch.

184
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:55,639
Don't say that. He's one of the
ones who wanted to quit Gomera...

185
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:57,799
Matsui-san was?

186
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:03,039
Yes. I hear he often
vented to the producer

187
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,519
about being sick of Gomera and
wanting to do normal roles.

188
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,949
It doesn't make sense.
Where did the killer disappear to?

189
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,079
We followed the footsteps
around the corner and up the stairs...

190
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,409
Hey, Conan-kun.
Let's make a grave for Gomera.

191
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,749
And then through that
door to the roof...

192
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,709
Come on, Conan-kun! His grave!

193
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,549
Shut up! This isn't the time for that!

194
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,209
Don't be getting mad like Gomera!

195
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,299
Like Gomera?

196
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,599
Look at this!
There's no tail mark on the steps!

197
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,999
That's proof that Gomera
went up the steps angry!

198
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,519
Because his tail
sticks up when he gets mad!

199
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,479
Wait a minute! Could it be?!

200
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,819
Hey!

201
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,789
What's the deal, Conan?!

202
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,149
Hey!

203
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:01,829
What do you see?

204
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:02,789
What is it?

205
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,579
Come on, Conan!

206
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:08,289
Conan-kun!

207
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,749
Alright! I figured out the trick!

208
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,209
Studio A

209
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:15,179
Why won't you let us inside?!

210
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,289
This is no playground for kids!

211
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:19,009
That way!

212
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,049
Yeah!

213
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,719
Yikes, there's one here too.

214
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:25,119
Say...

215
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,689
Storeroom â™ª1

216
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:32,759
Hey, you!

217
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,459
We forgot something!

218
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:34,899
Hey!

219
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,269
What are you all doing here?

220
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,869
Oh, Conan-kun!

221
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:44,039
We're about to take
Matsui-kun to the hospital.

222
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,999
It looks like he won't be able
to play Gomera with that leg.

223
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,869
Forget Gomera, he can't
even play a person...

224
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:56,959
So? Have you solved the case?

225
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,969
No, I still don't know who did it.

226
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:04,259
Why did the killer attack
Matsui-san in this storeroom?

227
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:10,409
Maybe the killer came to get the
knife but was spotted by Matsui-san?

228
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,999
Movie props can't kill people...

229
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,159
Wait a minute! In that case,
only that person can be the killer!

230
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:34,232
What's wrong, Shinichi?

231
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,332
Can't find my sleep gun...

232
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:41,462
Professor! What do you say to--

233
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,862
Inspector. We're going to
take Matsui-kun to the hospital.

234
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:46,672
Alright.

235
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,552
Not so fast!

236
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:53,762
The one responsible
is in this very room!

237
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:54,892
Come again?!

238
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:59,822
Hey! Just move your
lips to what I say!

239
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,812
Oh, come on! Let me
have some glory too!

240
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:08,322
Alright, Agasa-san. If you know
who did it, then please explain

241
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:10,782
how the killer
disappeared from the roof.

242
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,242
Special effects!

243
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:16,282
You know those holographs?

244
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:20,162
I bet the killer was one
of them the whole time!

245
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,492
Right?

246
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:27,822
What?! I ran into the killer in the hall,
and even saw them escape!

247
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:31,202
Oh, uh, forget what I said!
The truth is--

248
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:32,802
It was a trick.

249
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,262
An extremely simple one, at that.

250
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:38,612
Tomomi-san and the
children only saw the killer

251
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,482
until he or she turned the corner!

252
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:44,442
There's no telling if the killer
went up the stairs or not!

253
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:48,322
But there were footprints
on the stairs.

254
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,112
Yes...

255
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,562
Hey! Follow my voice!

256
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:53,412
Right...

257
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:58,872
The killer placed the footprints
on the stairs in advance!

258
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,242
Hardly anyone goes onto the roof.

259
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:07,292
It wouldn't be strange for
everyone to overlook that stairway!

260
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:12,702
Gomera's legs were probably
the only parts used to make them.

261
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:17,262
As proof of this, there is a tail mark
in the hall but not on the stairs.

262
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:22,232
The killer quickly removed the
suit in front of the stairs,

263
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:25,942
went down in the opposite
direction, entered a room,

264
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:31,112
lit the suit on fire, and
dropped it to the ground.

265
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:31,562
Oh!

266
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,112
Now I see!
Oh!

267
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,072
Oh, uh...

268
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:38,282
But would they be able to
make the footprints in advance

269
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:42,612
without knowing the color the
paint on the set would be?

270
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:44,402
Right, Adachi-san?

271
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:49,252
Yeah, I just happened to put that
paint there before the incident.

272
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,922
Hey, now, that doesn't hold up...

273
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,612
It's only natural it doesn't.

274
00:15:55,612 --> 00:16:00,852
Because Tomomi-san and Adachi-san
are lying to cover for the killer!

275
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,312
Lying?!

276
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:09,072
That paint was placed
there by the killer...

277
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,532
...to use for the footprint trick!

278
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:14,742
So these two know who the killer is?!

279
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:18,992
Adachi-san probably only
followed Tomomi-san's lead,

280
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,452
but she should know!

281
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:24,912
She probably saw the killer when
she bumped into him in the hallway.

282
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:28,112
So who exactly is the killer?

283
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,712
The killer was among the four
who weren't in the screening room

284
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:37,632
or who left the screening
room at some point.

285
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:41,952
Adachi-san was only gone for
four or five minutes. Not enough time.

286
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:45,602
Tomomi-san saw the killer with
the children; she's innocent too.

287
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,812
That leaves Director
Mikami and Matsui-san.

288
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:52,112
Hey now, Matsui-san is seriously injured,

289
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,152
and Mikami-kun is my best friend!

290
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:58,242
And therefore this comes as a shock!

291
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,742
Yes! The killer is--

292
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:00,992
Hey!

293
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,742
What're you doing, Conan-kun?

294
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,992
You're bothering me! Shoo!

295
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,712
Bothering you? Shoo?

296
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,702
Oh, just a noisy fly! Shoo!

297
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,672
So, who is the killer?

298
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:21,452
The killer is you, Matsui-san!

299
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:27,352
Get real! He couldn't escape
in that suit with his injury!

300
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:31,562
Assuming he really acquired
that injury before the murder.

301
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,022
You're saying his injury was--

302
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:37,992
Yes. After the murder,
he dropped the suit,

303
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:41,952
returned to the storeroom,
and stabbed himself with another knife

304
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,412
to deceive us!

305
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:49,202
But the children saw his
injury before the murder!

306
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,452
That was probably fake blood.

307
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:54,342
This is a movie set;
it would be easy to come by.

308
00:17:54,822 --> 00:18:00,952
But after they saw his injury,
they followed Gomera out to the studio!

309
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:04,702
There's only one way to the
studio from the storeroom.

310
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:08,022
Where exactly did Matsui-san
pass ahead of them?

311
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:13,242
The studio is right next
to the hallway door.

312
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:17,482
He probably entered
once the children left.

313
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:22,862
He then donned the suit and
murdered Producer Kamei.

314
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:27,412
This trick would need witnesses
to follow the paint footprints.

315
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:34,112
I see. So he chose these children
who couldn't follow as quickly.

316
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:38,882
Children are bundles of curiosity;
tell them not to go and they'll go.

317
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:43,682
The suit was lit on fire to
destroy sweat traces inside it.

318
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:47,112
What proof is there
that Matsui-san did it?

319
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:53,282
The knife he used to stab himself
is in the storeroom prop box.

320
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,702
It was probably the
only place to hide it;

321
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,112
he couldn't walk
after stabbing his leg.

322
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:03,452
There's one more thing--
the shirt he's wearing!

323
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:05,702
His shirt?

324
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:09,822
The killer ran off at full
speed with the suit still on.

325
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:13,112
The shirt would naturally
be soaked with sweat!

326
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:16,112
But his shirt has no sweat stains...

327
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:19,172
Of course not.
Because he changed it.

328
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,112
He changed it?!

329
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:24,032
Conan-kun can prove this!

330
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,472
Here I am!

331
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:33,182
Remember when Ayumi-chan
spilled juice on your shirt?

332
00:19:34,282 --> 00:19:37,282
But that's weird.
There's no stain here.

333
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:38,702
Where did you change clothes?

334
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,942
I thought you couldn't move
with your stabbed leg?

335
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:45,532
Are you sure you're not
mistaken, little boy?

336
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:48,452
Maybe the juice was spilled
on the floor instead?

337
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,532
But I really--

338
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:53,372
Are you really sure?
Try hard to remember!

339
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,832
Please! Little boy!

340
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,922
It's over, Tomomi-chan.

341
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:05,282
He's right. I was really sweaty,
so I changed shirts.

342
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,942
The shirt is inside my bag.

343
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,432
Alright! Check it at once!

344
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:12,952
Why would you kill Producer Kamei?

345
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,702
Didn't he give you work
in his next movie?

346
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:21,862
That had never entered my mind;
Gomera was all I thought about.

347
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:27,032
But weren't you the one who
wanted to quit Gomera the most?!

348
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:30,332
That's something that
Producer Kamei made up.

349
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:35,952
I thought it was strange how everyone
encouraged me with sad smiles.

350
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:40,002
I can't believe I learned of
his lies only two weeks ago...

351
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:44,952
I hastily negotiated with him,
but he said there was no turning back

352
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:50,742
as he had already announced
this was the final Gomera movie.

353
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:57,232
Everyone'll have long forgotten
that rubber freak in a year!

354
00:20:57,862 --> 00:21:00,322
Why didn't you talk with us?!

355
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,112
I couldn't.

356
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:06,192
It was too hard after seeing
everyone working hard one last time...

357
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:13,162
But I regret nothing. Now Gomera
won't have a final death scene.

358
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:18,282
I only feel bad about making
the children see that.

359
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:25,592
Say, Tomomi-chan. Did you
really see him in the suit from behind?

360
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:31,452
No, I didn't see anything.
He disappeared so quickly.

361
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:33,032
Then how...

362
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:37,612
I could tell by his movements,
without having to see inside.

363
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:43,502
After all, he's been my partner
for these past ten years.

364
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:14,032
Two months later, Gomera
made it onto theater screens.

365
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:19,782
The last scene was connected
with all the previous films

366
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,612
and Gomera's death scene was cut.

367
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:26,172
Gomera can now live
forever on the screen.

368
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:32,572
Crowds hold their breaths as they
watch the powerful visuals and plot!

369
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:37,322
Yet, Gomera's war cry sounded
especially forlorn to me

370
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:40,822
as it echoed throughout the theater...

371
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:47,552
When Teraoka-san tried
to arrest Matsuyama-san,

372
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,252
the gun went off!

373
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:51,842
Was this an accident?!

374
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:56,922
There's one thing we
kept from the media--

375
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,802
we found three sets of
fingerprints on the gun.

376
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:03,052
Who does the third set belong to?!

377
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:06,802
If the gun's owner
did as I think, then...

378
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,462
On the next Conan--

379
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:12,462
The 3rd Set of Fingerprints Murder Case.

380
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,567
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:16,571
Next Conan's Hint:
Video Cassette Case.

382
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:18,686
Video Cassette Case.
