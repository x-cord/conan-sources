1
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.740
Today, an out of the ordinary talk show

2
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.140
between a baseball player and Pops in Okinawa

3
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.340
turns into a murder case.

4
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.740
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:02.725
"9:33 am, Okinawa (Naha)"

8
00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.025
You haven't changed, have you, Nose?

9
00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:15.525
The way you tilt your neck to the right when you run.

10
00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:17.525
That habit of yours.

11
00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:18.825
Motoyama.

12
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:21.025
What brings you here?

13
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.125
It's only just past 9:30 am?

14
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.125
I told you over the phone last night, didn't I?

15
00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.725
That I'd fly over if for you.

16
00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:32.625
Like Hideyoshi would.

17
00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:42.625
"The Silent Route (Part 1)"

18
00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.625
"Half day ago, 6:29 pm, Tokyo" -What? We're going to Okinawa tomorrow?

19
00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.725
You didn't tell me about it at all!

20
00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:49.925
Didn't I tell you about it?

21
00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:51.125
You know him, don't you?

22
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.125
The King of Save,

23
00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:55.125
Toshizou Nose of the professional baseball team, Jaguars!

24
00:02:55.125 --> 00:03:00.125
Nichiuri TV has asked me to have a chat session with him!

25
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.325
But I wonder why they chose you, Pops?

26
00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:04.025
A professional baseball player and detective

27
00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:06.525
don't seem to have much in common.

28
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:09.525
Are you dumb or what?

29
00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:13.325
Nose is known as the brain pitcher player of the baseball world!

30
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.925
It's his sharp-eye of discerning the habits

31
00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.925
and type of ball the batter will hit against my power of deduction!

32
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:25.025
Are you sure you can handle it?

33
00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:28.125
I hear that Mr. Nose is a very difficult person to deal with.

34
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.525
Don't worry!

35
00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:31.925
I hear that this sport reporter who is on good terms with Nose

36
00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.125
-will join in on our conversation too. -Thank you very much.

37
00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:38.925
So, that was Mr. Kigure training here in Miyazaki!

38
00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:42.825
He seems to be all out to get a straight victory for the Falcons!

39
00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.025
Thank you very much.

40
00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:45.025
Then, Mr. Motoyama,

41
00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.725
you're scheduled for a talk show with Mr. Nose tomorrow in Okinawa,

42
00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:50.025
I hope that it'll be as interesting as today.

43
00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:53.225
I'll be fine! Nose is my best friend

44
00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.625
and besides, a famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

45
00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:57.625
will pitch in to help me tomorrow too!

46
00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:58.625
See!

47
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:00.925
What time is your flight tomorrow?

48
00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:05.925
I think it's departing at 6:35 am from Haneda Airport tomorrow

49
00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:09.325
because Nose's seems to only be free in the morning.

50
00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:14.325
What? Which means we have to get up before 5 am?

51
00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:18.625
Then, we'll have to get ready and hit the sack early today too, Conan!

52
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.025
Okay!

53
00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:22.125
Hey... I'm going alone.

54
00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:25.025
Right, let's run over to the convenience store now

55
00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:27.225
and pick up stuff that we need!

56
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.125
Okay! Let's go!

57
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.625
We've to hurry because we don't have time!

58
00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:33.925
I tell you, Dad, you should've told us earlier.

59
00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:36.225
He's being mean, isn't he?

60
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:41.325
"Same day, 7:20 pm, Miyazaki"

61
00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:44.125
Hi, Nose! Did you watch the program?

62
00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:46.825
My corner that was aired a while ago.

63
00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:50.425
"Masaharu Motoyama" -Yeah. You mean the sports program on Nichiuri TV

64
00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:53.325
that's aired at around 6:30 pm?

65
00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:54.525
Right.

66
00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:58.825
"At the same time, Okinawa" -Sorry. I was out eating and missed it.

67
00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:01.025
"Toshizou Nose" -I'm going out drinking with some young players

68
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.025
who are training here with me now.

69
00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:04.425
Did you want anything?

70
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:08.625
No. All I wanted to say was see you at the talk show tomorrow.

71
00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:10.925
Same here and help me out

72
00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:14.725
if the Detective Kogoro Mouri digs in too deep, will you?

73
00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:16.325
By the way, Motoyama.

74
00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:18.725
Don't miss your flight tomorrow!

75
00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:21.025
You're not that great getting up in the morning.

76
00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:25.025
I'll be fine, since my flight leaves at 8:15 am.

77
00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.825
You know I'll fly over if for you, right?

78
00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:31.625
Just like Hideyoshi would.

79
00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:34.225
Hideyoshi?

80
00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:35.925
Then am I supposed to be Nobunaga or something?

81
00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:40.725
It's true that I'm the one who got you that TV job after you retired

82
00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:43.125
but I only did it because we entered the team at that same time!

83
00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:45.425
No need to feel obligated or anything!

84
00:05:46.525 --> 00:05:49.125
The young ones are here, I got to go.

85
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:50.625
See you tomorrow!

86
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.525
Yeah. Don't drink too much!

87
00:05:53.525 --> 00:05:58.125
You've got the Japan record career save on your shoulder.

88
00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.225
Yeah!

89
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:05.425
You, Nobunaga?

90
00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:10.025
You're Mitsuhide.

91
00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:11.825
"8:09 am, Flight SKJ931 (Tokyo to Okinawa)"

92
00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:14.025
Of all things,

93
00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:16.825
they've come along with me.

94
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:21.625
What's wrong? When you called the TV station last night,

95
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:25.725
they said they'd pay for Conan and I too, didn't they?

96
00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:29.125
Thanks to you guys, my seat was ranked down to a regular seat, though.

97
00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:34.125
The Okinawa food that I ate last time I went was really delicious!

98
00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:39.025
My plans of having a ball over food a drinks with an Okinawan beauty.

99
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:40.525
Darn it!

100
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:41.625
Don't worry!

101
00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:44.425
I'll just take pictures with my digital camera and won't get in your way.

102
00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.025
Did you have a digital camera?

103
00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:48.125
Yep.

104
00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:55.325
Remember? The one that you won at the year-end party?

105
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:04.625
I'm so sorry!

106
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.225
I'm sorry!

107
00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:07.925
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:07.925 --> 00:07:11.425
Why did you bring tennis balls with you?

109
00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:12.525
Well, a boy in my class that's in the baseball club,

110
00:07:12.525 --> 00:07:15.325
who was watching the program last night,

111
00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:18.025
asked me to get him Mr. Nose's autograph.

112
00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:20.125
I told them that I didn't have the card to write autographs on,

113
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:22.925
then they said anything is okay.

114
00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:27.325
So I brought the tennis balls that Sonoko gave me.

115
00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:30.225
The ball that dad used for the community baseball game

116
00:07:30.225 --> 00:07:31.825
was all soiled and dirty besides.

117
00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:35.225
Does four balls mean there are four members in your class

118
00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:36.325
that are in the baseball club?

119
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:38.625
There are three boys in the baseball club

120
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.225
and the other one is for me.

121
00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:43.625
It's Eri, isn't it?

122
00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.025
She used to be a Jaguar fan.

123
00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:49.625
Right! So please, will you get his autograph for mother?

124
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:50.925
No way!

125
00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:53.025
I don't want to stick a tennis ball out at a baseball player

126
00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:55.725
and ask for his autograph.

127
00:07:56.825 --> 00:07:58.125
True.

128
00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:02.625
"9:23 am, Okinawa (Naha Airport)"

129
00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.525
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Mouri.

130
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:07.625
I'm Teranishi of Nichiuri TV Okinawa!

131
00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.925
Hello, I'm here with my daughter!

132
00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:13.525
Daughter? Where is she?

133
00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:14.525
What?

134
00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.825
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

135
00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.325
I'm going to go see if they sell autograph cards!

136
00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:21.725
I tell you.

137
00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:24.225
By the way, how's the you know what?

138
00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:26.825
Oh, you mean at night, right?

139
00:08:26.825 --> 00:08:28.925
Yes, I've reserved a great place!

140
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.325
Oh! No.

141
00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:31.825
We're canceling that!

142
00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:33.925
I'm talking about the other stuff.

143
00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:36.825
Oh. That.

144
00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:40.925
I asked Mr. Motoyama who will join in on the talk show today

145
00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:42.025
and he agreed just like that.

146
00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:43.425
That's good to know!

147
00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:47.225
And, Mr. Motoyama has already arrived here from Miyazaki?

148
00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:50.525
No. He'll be on the flight arriving at 9:50 am

149
00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.025
so we'll have to wait another 30 minutes.

150
00:08:53.025 --> 00:08:56.725
That's the only flight there is from Miyazaki to Okinawa.

151
00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.525
Then, shall I take my daughter and the boy

152
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:02.125
to the hotel that Mr. Nose will be staying at?

153
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.925
I guess so but I don't think Mr. Nose is there.

154
00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:08.025
Why not?

155
00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:13.125
He seems to routinely jogs from 9 am to 10 am in the morning.

156
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.725
So, I'm sure that he in the midst of...

157
00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:18.925
running along a road somewhere near the hotel.

158
00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:24.425
"9:34 am, Okinawa (Naha)"

159
00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:29.825
You know about it, don't you?

160
00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:31.825
The "great revenge" of Hideyoshi.

161
00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:34.825
That is Mitsuhide who wanted to kill Nobunaga

162
00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:37.825
and rule over the world.

163
00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:40.625
The superhuman act of Hideyoshi, going from Okayama to Kyoto

164
00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:44.025
in as little as three days to take revenge.

165
00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:47.525
Nose, I hate to say this

166
00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:49.025
but I'm not letting you get to the top.

167
00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:58.825
"9:52 am, Okinawa (Naha Airport)"

168
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:01.825
Hey, how long are you going to keep searching?

169
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:04.525
Mr. Motoyama's flight should be arriving soon!

170
00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:07.925
Well, I can't find autograph cards anywhere!

171
00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:11.725
Okay! I'll get autographs for your friends for you, then.

172
00:10:11.725 --> 00:10:14.325
Really! You'll get mother's too then, right?

173
00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:15.325
No way.

174
00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:16.825
What's with you!

175
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:20.525
Do you know where they sell autograph cards near here?

176
00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:21.725
Autograph card?

177
00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:24.125
Let's see. The nearest place is...

178
00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:26.325
-Dad! -There he is!

179
00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:28.825
Mr. Motoyama, over here!

180
00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:31.325
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

181
00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:34.125
How do you do? I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri!

182
00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:35.925
I'm Masaharu Motoyama!

183
00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:37.525
I've heard a lot about you.

184
00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:40.525
-I'm his daughter. -I'm sorry!

185
00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:41.925
We don't have much time,

186
00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:44.025
so let's continue the introductions in the car.

187
00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:46.725
-All right! -Shall we get going then?

188
00:10:46.725 --> 00:10:49.225
Okinawa sure is a nice place.

189
00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:51.525
Too bad it's raining, though.

190
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:53.425
Hey! Let's go sonny!

191
00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:56.625
Oh, okay.

192
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.925
Mr. Motoyama seems to be a kind person

193
00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.825
so maybe I'll be able to ask him for Mr. Nose's autograph.

194
00:11:01.825 --> 00:11:04.225
I guess so.

195
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:19.025
It seems that Nose hasn't returned to the hotel yet.

196
00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:22.425
Maybe he got tired on the way back and is resting somewhere?

197
00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:25.425
After all, he's not all that young. I mean you know...

198
00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:27.725
That's...

199
00:11:31.225 --> 00:11:33.925
Hey, you'll catch cold sleeping in a place like that!

200
00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:39.325
That is...

201
00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:41.025
The uniform of the Jaguars.

202
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:50.325
Hey, Conan!

203
00:11:53.425 --> 00:11:55.825
Hey! Isn't he Mr. Nose?

204
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.425
-No way. -Mr. Nose?

205
00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.525
This is bad!

206
00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:03.925
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

207
00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:05.525
The police?

208
00:12:14.147 --> 00:12:16.447
Hey! Isn't he Mr. Nose?

209
00:12:16.447 --> 00:12:19.147
-No way. -Mr. Nose?

210
00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:21.047
This is bad!

211
00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:24.447
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

212
00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:27.747
The police?

213
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.447
No. There's no need to call an ambulance.

214
00:12:31.947 --> 00:12:34.247
Mr. Nose has been stabbed in the stomach with something

215
00:12:34.247 --> 00:12:35.847
and is already dead.

216
00:12:35.847 --> 00:12:36.847
No way.

217
00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:39.847
Ran! You brought a digital camera along, didn't you?

218
00:12:39.847 --> 00:12:41.547
Yes.

219
00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:45.647
Let's take a picture of the scene before the police get here.

220
00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:53.847
The digital camera...

221
00:13:07.147 --> 00:13:08.947
Here it is!

222
00:13:08.947 --> 00:13:10.547
Hey, Ran! You haven't found it yet?

223
00:13:10.547 --> 00:13:12.147
Hurry it up, will you?

224
00:13:12.147 --> 00:13:13.247
Okay!

225
00:13:17.147 --> 00:13:18.947
First from right above,

226
00:13:18.947 --> 00:13:20.447
take two or three pictures.

227
00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:23.047
Be careful not go inside the grassy area.

228
00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:34.747
What's wrong, Ran?

229
00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.447
Well...

230
00:13:36.447 --> 00:13:38.247
I was thinking of getting mom

231
00:13:38.247 --> 00:13:42.847
a picture of Mr. Nose posing his signature pose.

232
00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:45.247
And yet I end up taking this kind of picture.

233
00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:51.947
Sorry, never mind already.

234
00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:54.947
I'll take the pictures so you go back inside the car.

235
00:14:36.547 --> 00:14:41.747
This guy's Nose of the Jaguars!

236
00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:45.347
I saw on TV that he was training over here.

237
00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:49.547
The estimated time of death is around 9:30 am.

238
00:14:49.547 --> 00:14:50.747
The cause of death is loss of blood

239
00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:53.647
from being stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

240
00:14:53.647 --> 00:14:56.347
The weapon hasn't been found yet though.

241
00:14:56.347 --> 00:14:58.247
And where is the person who found him?

242
00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:00.847
I think it was...

243
00:15:04.147 --> 00:15:06.747
Who is the one that found the body?

244
00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:08.147
It would be us.

245
00:15:08.147 --> 00:15:10.147
We coincidentally happened to drive by

246
00:15:10.147 --> 00:15:13.947
and found Mr. Nose lying on the ground!

247
00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:18.247
He was probably stabbed by someone while jogging.

248
00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:20.247
If I remember correctly, you're...

249
00:15:20.247 --> 00:15:22.047
Yeah. That famous detective.

250
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.647
Do you know me?

251
00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:26.047
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

252
00:15:26.047 --> 00:15:28.247
You're the talk of the town in Okinawa!

253
00:15:28.247 --> 00:15:31.247
Yes...

254
00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:33.547
You're highly valued for your tremendous appetite, right?

255
00:15:33.547 --> 00:15:34.647
Yeah.

256
00:15:35.847 --> 00:15:38.447
Come to think of it, when we were here before this,

257
00:15:38.447 --> 00:15:41.147
Pops entered a big-eater's contest with Hattori.

258
00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:46.147
So, it's almost as if the case has been solved then!

259
00:15:46.147 --> 00:15:47.947
We're counting on you!

260
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.647
I wonder if they really believe so.

261
00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:55.647
I know somebody you can count on more than Mr. Mouri, though!

262
00:15:57.447 --> 00:15:59.747
Sports reporter, Mr. Motoyama!

263
00:15:59.747 --> 00:16:02.447
Just what are you talking about, sonny?

264
00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:05.747
Because when we found Mr. Nose,

265
00:16:05.747 --> 00:16:08.247
his blood was drained in the rain

266
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:10.347
and unless we went up close to take a look

267
00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:13.447
we couldn't tell that he was stabbed in the stomach!

268
00:16:16.547 --> 00:16:20.047
Besides, if one knew that Mr. Nose was jogging,

269
00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.547
wouldn't it be most natural to think that Mr. Nose fell ill

270
00:16:22.547 --> 00:16:24.147
and was lying on the ground?

271
00:16:24.147 --> 00:16:28.147
But you said to call the police without even getting off the car.

272
00:16:28.147 --> 00:16:32.047
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

273
00:16:32.047 --> 00:16:34.947
Even Holmes can't beat you as a detective!

274
00:16:37.047 --> 00:16:39.447
How did you know?

275
00:16:39.447 --> 00:16:41.447
That it was murder?

276
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:48.947
Come to think of it, before I checked Mr. Nose's stomach

277
00:16:48.947 --> 00:16:51.847
and mentioned him being stabbed you.

278
00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:54.347
-Through a phone call! -A phone call?

279
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.247
After the TV appearance last night,

280
00:16:56.247 --> 00:16:59.047
I called Nose from the hotel in Miyazaki,

281
00:16:59.047 --> 00:17:00.947
he mentioned that.

282
00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:03.547
A strange man claiming to be a Jaguars anti-fans

283
00:17:03.547 --> 00:17:05.847
was troubling him with crank calls.

284
00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:09.447
Well, when I saw Nose lying on the ground,

285
00:17:09.447 --> 00:17:11.547
I just felt that something was wrong.

286
00:17:11.547 --> 00:17:13.347
Is that true?

287
00:17:13.347 --> 00:17:17.047
Well, I guess it'll do you no good to suspect me anyway,

288
00:17:17.047 --> 00:17:20.147
because I couldn't have committed the crime.

289
00:17:20.147 --> 00:17:21.347
Just what do you mean?

290
00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:24.247
Because Mr. Nose's estimated time of death

291
00:17:24.247 --> 00:17:26.647
is about 9:30 am this morning, right?

292
00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:28.047
Just around that time,

293
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.647
I was on the flight that left Miyazaki at 8:15 am

294
00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:35.447
and scheduled to arrive in Okinawa at 9:50 am.

295
00:17:35.447 --> 00:17:36.847
Check the passenger's list!

296
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:37.847
Yes, sir!

297
00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:42.547
My name is not on the list.

298
00:17:42.547 --> 00:17:43.847
Why not?

299
00:17:43.847 --> 00:17:45.447
I'm pretty well known.

300
00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:46.847
I don't like people making a fuss

301
00:17:46.847 --> 00:17:50.547
that I've always bought my tickets under an alias.

302
00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:53.547
Besides, I was slightly disguised wearing a hat and all that,

303
00:17:53.547 --> 00:17:56.747
I don't think anyone saw me.

304
00:17:56.747 --> 00:17:59.447
So, what was the alias that you used?

305
00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:02.247
Yamada.

306
00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:04.647
No, maybe it was Tanaka?

307
00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:10.447
Well, if Mr. Motoyama was in Miyazaki last night,

308
00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:12.047
he has an alibi.

309
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:16.147
Because that's the only fight that flies from Miyazaki to Okinawa.

310
00:18:16.147 --> 00:18:21.847
Please go ahead and ask the hotel in Miyazaki that I spent the night at.

311
00:18:21.847 --> 00:18:23.047
Here you go.

312
00:18:24.447 --> 00:18:28.647
The Miyazaki Princess Hotel, room number...

313
00:18:28.647 --> 00:18:30.247
Is it this one?

314
00:18:30.247 --> 00:18:34.747
I called Mr. Nose on my cell phone last night

315
00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:37.947
so please check the outgoing calls record of that room.

316
00:18:39.147 --> 00:18:40.247
Okay, hurry and check it out!

317
00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:41.247
Yes, sir!

318
00:18:41.247 --> 00:18:42.547
Okay, then everyone...

319
00:18:42.547 --> 00:18:45.447
May I ask all of you to come with me to the station?

320
00:18:45.447 --> 00:18:46.447
Darn it.

321
00:18:46.447 --> 00:18:48.947
It was supposed to be the great chat show of all three of us.

322
00:18:48.947 --> 00:18:50.447
Great chat show?

323
00:18:50.447 --> 00:18:54.247
He's from Nichiuri TV of Okinawa,

324
00:18:54.247 --> 00:18:58.447
and was scheduled to have a chat with Mr. Nose today.

325
00:18:58.447 --> 00:19:01.847
That includes Mr. Motoyama and I.

326
00:19:01.847 --> 00:19:03.147
Who would've even imagined that

327
00:19:03.147 --> 00:19:07.047
we'd run into Nose's corpse while heading over to his hotel.

328
00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:10.047
Well, we'll get to the details back at the station then.

329
00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:13.247
Inspector!

330
00:19:13.247 --> 00:19:15.547
We found this near the corpse.

331
00:19:15.547 --> 00:19:17.747
A timetable and can of tennis balls?

332
00:19:17.747 --> 00:19:19.847
They're mine!

333
00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:21.247
I'm sorry!

334
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:24.047
I seem to have dropped them when I got off the car.

335
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:37.547
"Okinawa Prefecture Police, Naha Headquarters"

336
00:19:38.047 --> 00:19:39.947
Inspector! It's been confirmed!

337
00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:41.647
What?

338
00:19:42.947 --> 00:19:45.147
About the phone call.

339
00:19:45.147 --> 00:19:49.447
It's true that Mr. Motoyama called Mr. Nose

340
00:19:49.447 --> 00:19:53.447
from his hotel in Miyazaki at 7:20 pm to 7:23 pm yesterday.

341
00:19:53.447 --> 00:19:54.447
See?

342
00:19:54.447 --> 00:20:00.347
Even without it, I appeared live on TV from Miyazaki last night.

343
00:20:00.347 --> 00:20:05.247
Viewers all over the nation will prove my alibi for me.

344
00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:07.447
Come to think of it, that's true.

345
00:20:07.447 --> 00:20:10.347
And? Have you heard of any characteristics of the man

346
00:20:10.347 --> 00:20:13.547
who was making crank calls to Mr. Nose?

347
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:16.347
No. All he said was an odd man.

348
00:20:16.347 --> 00:20:18.547
An odd man.

349
00:20:18.547 --> 00:20:21.447
It sure is strange, though.

350
00:20:21.447 --> 00:20:24.347
I confirmed with his other teammates,

351
00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:27.947
but none of them seems to have heard of any crank calls.

352
00:20:27.947 --> 00:20:30.847
Of course not.

353
00:20:30.847 --> 00:20:34.047
Nose was the much feared guardian of the Jaguars,

354
00:20:34.047 --> 00:20:36.447
so I'm sure he couldn't mention anything

355
00:20:36.447 --> 00:20:38.247
about being frightened over a crank call.

356
00:20:38.247 --> 00:20:40.347
I, however, have been best friends with him for a long time

357
00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:42.747
and there was nothing we didn't talk about with each other.

358
00:20:42.747 --> 00:20:43.847
Now that you mentioned it,

359
00:20:43.847 --> 00:20:47.447
you entered the team at the same time as Mr. Nose, didn't you?

360
00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:49.147
Yes.

361
00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:52.547
You were awarded King of Save and Best Rookie the first year.

362
00:20:52.547 --> 00:20:55.047
But I damaged my shoulder the second year and underwent an operation.

363
00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:57.247
However, I never regained my pitching velocity

364
00:20:57.247 --> 00:20:59.147
and resigned in my fifth year.

365
00:20:59.147 --> 00:21:01.747
I gave in to the second year jinx

366
00:21:01.747 --> 00:21:04.947
and was no more than a one-time clutch player.

367
00:21:04.947 --> 00:21:06.847
I was planning to tell the young players

368
00:21:06.847 --> 00:21:11.647
who are training here with Nose here tomorrow, but...

369
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:14.047
Under the circumstances, I guess it'll be better to cancel

370
00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:16.147
the interview of the young players

371
00:21:16.147 --> 00:21:18.447
that we were planning to hold tomorrow.

372
00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:31.947
At any rate, please arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

373
00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:35.047
The devil who got in the way of my best friend

374
00:21:35.047 --> 00:21:37.847
making his Japan record of saves.

375
00:21:37.847 --> 00:21:39.447
No, not right.

376
00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:42.447
He's the killer.

377
00:21:43.647 --> 00:21:46.347
Can I make a phone call?

378
00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:47.747
I'll be done in a minute.

379
00:21:47.747 --> 00:21:49.147
Sure, go ahead.

380
00:21:51.247 --> 00:21:53.847
But he has an alibi.

381
00:21:56.747 --> 00:21:58.447
Why on earth...

382
00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:13.547
What the...

383
00:22:22.047 --> 00:22:24.147
What is this?

384
00:22:24.147 --> 00:22:25.547
What's this thing that I feel?

385
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:00.947
"Next Episode"

386
00:24:00.947 --> 00:24:04.347
Conan...

387
00:24:04.347 --> 00:24:05.647
What's the matter?

388
00:24:05.647 --> 00:24:06.747
Are you all right?

389
00:24:06.747 --> 00:24:08.147
What a frightening look you have on your face.

390
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:11.247
What was that?

391
00:24:11.247 --> 00:24:14.747
I found the seat but you can't go straight.

392
00:24:14.747 --> 00:24:17.147
Okay, then...

393
00:24:17.147 --> 00:24:19.647
Well, that's natural too.

394
00:24:19.647 --> 00:24:22.147
Because you killed him.

395
00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "The Silent Route (Part 2)"

396
00:24:30.074 --> 00:24:32.274
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:32.274 --> 00:24:34.074
"Timetable"

398
00:24:34.074 --> 00:24:36.374
Summer vacation's almost over. Conan, how's your homework coming along?

399
00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:37.374
What about you, Ran?

400
00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:39.274
I wonder if Shinichi's doing okay?
