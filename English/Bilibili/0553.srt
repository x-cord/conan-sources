Togashi.

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.782
Dad.

Today at 16:00...

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:38.982
This man, Fumitaka Togashi was scheduled to be sent

7
00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:41.882
to the prosecutor as a suspect of murder.

8
00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.582
In other words, he was going to be taken to the police.

13
00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:57.982
confronting the suspect in the interrogation room.

14
00:00:57.982 --> 00:00:59.582
He sees through the one and only truth.

-Okay, great! -It's my turn next.

20
00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:14.854
Togashi!

21
00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:18.054
Good work! Great how you hung in there!

22
00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:19.454
Mr. Mouri!

23
00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:24.954
Fumitaka Togashi is a murderer that Pops had arrested

24
00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.554
when he was a police detective,

25
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:29.154
and today was the day that man came out of prison.

26
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.754
-Excuse me! -Throw it over this way, please.

27
00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:37.254
Here!

28
00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:41.354
-Thank you, sir! -Thank you!

29
00:03:44.254 --> 00:03:46.754
Although it's not much, I've reserved a seat for you too.

30
00:03:46.754 --> 00:03:48.554
Let's go and...

31
00:03:50.154 --> 00:03:52.154
I'm sorry, if you will excuse me.

32
00:03:52.154 --> 00:03:54.554
Huh?

33
00:03:54.554 --> 00:03:56.054
Hey, Togashi!

34
00:03:56.054 --> 00:03:57.954
Wait! Hakamada!

35
00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:02.754
The incident occurred.

36
00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:39.454
Last night at around 22:00,

37
00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:41.454
Mr. Takehiko Sakuraba, age 55

38
00:04:41.454 --> 00:04:43.154
who resides at 4-Beika-cho was murdered.

39
00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:46.754
A convict, who was released on parole from the Musashino Prison yesterday,

40
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.354
who was under the supervision of parole officer, Mr. Sakuraba,

41
00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:53.554
suspect Fumitaka Togashi, age 32 was arrested.

42
00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:57.554
What? It can't be...

43
00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:03.854
"Beika Police Station. Today at 10:05 a.m."

44
00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:07.554
"Officer Norio Kasamatsu (52), Beika Police Station 1st Division"

45
00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:11.554
It's no use keeping quiet, Togashi!

46
00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:17.654
Detective Mouri is outside, too.

47
00:05:17.654 --> 00:05:18.854
What?

48
00:05:18.854 --> 00:05:22.554
I see. So, you arrested Togashi in the past.

49
00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:23.754
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:28.054
He killed a man in a fight over something trivial.

51
00:05:28.054 --> 00:05:30.754
And although his lawyer pleaded self-defense,

52
00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:33.054
his attitude in court was rebellious,

53
00:05:33.054 --> 00:05:34.954
and it turned out he had a previous police record.

54
00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:38.154
Therefore, he was sentenced to a term of 13 years.

55
00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:39.954
Nevertheless, he is a kind guy inside,

56
00:05:39.954 --> 00:05:42.054
who thinks a lot of his mother.

57
00:05:42.054 --> 00:05:44.454
After serving his term, his character completely reformed

58
00:05:44.454 --> 00:05:46.154
and he became a model prisoner.

59
00:05:47.554 --> 00:05:50.054
How can it be that he would kill again?

60
00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:52.754
Moreover, on the night of the day that he's released on parole.

61
00:05:52.754 --> 00:05:54.354
It's unbelievable!

62
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.454
I understand how you must feel, but...

63
00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:00.154
What a softie.

64
00:06:00.154 --> 00:06:04.354
It just goes to show that people don't change that easily.

65
00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:05.954
So, Inspector.

66
00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:07.454
We'll be go through the procedure of sending him

67
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:09.454
to the prosecutor as scheduled.

68
00:06:12.254 --> 00:06:14.054
Please wait a while.

69
00:06:14.054 --> 00:06:15.854
You're Mr. Mouri I believe.

70
00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:18.254
I've heard a lot about you.

71
00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:19.854
Well, regardless of who you were in the past,

72
00:06:19.854 --> 00:06:22.454
right now you're just a private eye.

73
00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:25.254
Outsiders don't have a say in this!

74
00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:32.454
Officer Kasamatsu, process it immediately.

75
00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:34.054
Yes, sir!

76
00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:35.154
Inspector!

77
00:06:35.154 --> 00:06:38.454
Only, he's to be sent to the prosecutor as scheduled at 16:00.

78
00:06:38.454 --> 00:06:40.754
We'll take a break till then.

79
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:44.754
But Togashi is to be kept here at the interrogation room!

80
00:06:46.254 --> 00:06:47.854
That's ridiculous!

81
00:06:47.854 --> 00:06:49.554
You've got to be joking!

82
00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:52.854
I'll talk to your superior about this.

83
00:06:55.954 --> 00:06:58.654
Thank you so much, Inspector!

84
00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:03.854
Sleeping Kogoro. We owe you a lot, you see.

85
00:07:03.854 --> 00:07:07.854
I repeat, break time is till 16:00!

86
00:07:07.854 --> 00:07:10.354
Yes, sir!

87
00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:13.454
So, that's how Pops got special permission

88
00:07:13.454 --> 00:07:16.554
to interrogate Togashi, but...

89
00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:20.054
Togashi, don't just sit there, say something!

90
00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.554
Togashi!

91
00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:24.954
Dad...

92
00:07:26.554 --> 00:07:31.454
The victim's wounds are concentrated on the right side of his body.

93
00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:35.154
No, Conan, you shouldn't look without permission.

94
00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:36.954
Does that mean that the culprit was holding

95
00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:38.354
the murder weapon in his left hand?

96
00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:41.754
Yeah. We also have an eye-witness report on that, too.

97
00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:45.154
But he's not a lefty.

98
00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:49.954
No, but there are several wounds on the left side too.

99
00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:51.954
He probably switched the hands he was holding the murder weapon with,

100
00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:54.054
several times when he was struggling with the culprit.

101
00:07:54.054 --> 00:07:57.354
It's true. That's a possibility.

102
00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:59.854
To make sure if it was really so...

103
00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.954
Where's the men's room?

104
00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:06.754
I don't want you to get lost, so I'll wait here.

105
00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:08.554
Thank you.

106
00:08:14.854 --> 00:08:16.654
Hello?

107
00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:18.454
Mr. Mouri? Huh?

108
00:08:18.454 --> 00:08:19.854
What about the interrogation?

109
00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:22.354
I'm on break for lunch.

110
00:08:22.354 --> 00:08:25.854
The thing is, Takagi. I'd like you to do me a favor.

111
00:08:25.854 --> 00:08:28.754
Huh? Yes, sir!

112
00:08:28.754 --> 00:08:31.754
Huh? Go to the site right now?

113
00:08:31.754 --> 00:08:34.454
Yes, yes, all right!

114
00:08:34.454 --> 00:08:37.354
And about Ran...

115
00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:40.254
Dad says for me to go home?

116
00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:42.954
He said that you don't have to worry.

117
00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:45.654
It seems that Conan's going home too.

118
00:08:45.654 --> 00:08:48.254
See you then, because I've got to run!

119
00:08:48.254 --> 00:08:50.654
Wait!

120
00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:53.354
Gee, everybody's so selfish!

121
00:08:54.954 --> 00:08:57.154
Conan?

122
00:08:57.154 --> 00:08:59.654
Pops says he forgot to tell you some things,

123
00:08:59.654 --> 00:09:01.154
so he wants me to go along with you.

124
00:09:01.154 --> 00:09:03.154
Huh? You mean Mr. Mouri?

125
00:09:03.154 --> 00:09:04.854
Hurry! There's not much time

126
00:09:04.854 --> 00:09:06.754
before he'll be taken to the prosecutor, is there?

127
00:09:09.154 --> 00:09:11.454
Do you remember, Togashi?

128
00:09:11.454 --> 00:09:14.954
After serving time, you wrote me letters for 6 months.

129
00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:17.454
You wrote that you are reflecting on yourself

130
00:09:17.454 --> 00:09:20.254
and repenting what you had done.

131
00:09:20.254 --> 00:09:21.954
That you're going to become a new person

132
00:09:21.954 --> 00:09:25.454
and take care of your mother from now on.

133
00:09:25.454 --> 00:09:30.454
Just as you said, you got back on your feet.

134
00:09:30.454 --> 00:09:33.054
I never felt happier

135
00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:35.454
about having been a police detective than that time.

136
00:09:35.454 --> 00:09:39.354
Rather, your mother was the one who was most happiest.

137
00:09:39.354 --> 00:09:41.054
How is she?

138
00:09:43.954 --> 00:09:46.454
What's the matter, Togashi?

139
00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:49.654
Oh boy.

140
00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:52.854
Don't go touching things here and there now, Conan.

141
00:09:52.854 --> 00:09:54.454
I won't.

142
00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:56.454
Please reconsider the eye-witness testimony

143
00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:58.654
from the standpoint of the murder site.

144
00:09:58.654 --> 00:10:00.454
Just how do I do something like that?

145
00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:04.854
The culprit was witnessed from this window, right?

146
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:05.854
Huh?

147
00:10:05.854 --> 00:10:08.554
Yeah, the eye-witness is, see over there...

148
00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:10.054
that elderly woman.

149
00:10:10.054 --> 00:10:11.354
Huh?

150
00:10:11.354 --> 00:10:13.054
Why are there blood stains on two separated places,

151
00:10:13.054 --> 00:10:15.054
one away from the other?

152
00:10:15.054 --> 00:10:17.654
True, I wonder why?

153
00:10:17.654 --> 00:10:20.554
These shiny things are shattered pieces of glass, right?

154
00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:23.254
It's the mirror of the door of that closet.

155
00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:27.554
Maybe it cracked when the victim and the culprit fought each other.

156
00:10:27.554 --> 00:10:29.454
Was the murder weapon on the ground here?

157
00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:31.854
-Yeah. -Any prints?

158
00:10:31.854 --> 00:10:34.554
You mean on the murder weapon? None.

159
00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:37.054
They were wiped off with something.

160
00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:39.654
Not only were they wiped off from the murder weapon,

161
00:10:39.654 --> 00:10:40.654
but also from the sliding door

162
00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:43.454
and everything that the killer is thought to have touched.

163
00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:46.154
Let me see it!

164
00:10:46.154 --> 00:10:48.454
The prints of the victim aren't on it, either.

165
00:10:48.454 --> 00:10:50.554
That's right. The kitchen, the bathroom,

166
00:10:50.554 --> 00:10:53.854
the bedroom, also have no prints anywhere.

167
00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:55.454
Everything's been completely wiped off.

168
00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:58.454
I wonder why he went that far?

169
00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:02.254
When and where was Mr. Togashi arrested?

170
00:11:02.254 --> 00:11:05.154
Uh...

171
00:11:05.154 --> 00:11:08.954
Last night at 22:30 in Beika Park.

172
00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:11.854
What time was the murder witnessed?

173
00:11:11.854 --> 00:11:15.454
10 minutes before that at around 22:20.

174
00:11:15.454 --> 00:11:16.854
If you were to run from here to Beika Park,

175
00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:20.454
it would take at least 7 or 8 minutes, right?

176
00:11:20.454 --> 00:11:21.954
Which means?

177
00:11:21.954 --> 00:11:24.154
It wouldn't have been possible for him to do all he did

178
00:11:24.154 --> 00:11:26.854
in just a matter of a few minutes

179
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.954
after committing the crime!

180
00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:31.154
He wiped the print off before committing the crime?

181
00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:32.754
It can't be.

182
00:11:32.754 --> 00:11:35.754
Then, he did it along with the crime.

183
00:11:35.754 --> 00:11:37.754
Or, could there have been someone else?

184
00:11:37.754 --> 00:11:41.254
Yeah, that's highly probable. But...

185
00:11:41.254 --> 00:11:44.654
When he was arrested, Togashi was alone.

186
00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:47.054
So, they fled separately?

187
00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:49.454
Only a night has passed yet,

188
00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:51.454
so maybe if we search for an eye-witness...

189
00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:52.654
That's it!

190
00:11:52.654 --> 00:11:54.454
"Beika Police Station"

191
00:11:54.454 --> 00:11:56.354
Togashi.

192
00:11:56.354 --> 00:11:59.354
Back then, when I arrested you,

193
00:11:59.354 --> 00:12:02.754
you were outraged because a bunch of hoodlums

194
00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:05.254
beat your friend up and was badly hurt,

195
00:12:05.254 --> 00:12:07.754
and did what you did in a fury of anger, right?

196
00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:13.054
Don't tell me that you're sticking up for somebody again?

197
00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:17.454
You mean there was somebody else there?

198
00:12:17.454 --> 00:12:19.954
Togashi, tell me the truth!

199
00:12:19.954 --> 00:12:21.354
Please tell me the truth, Togashi!

200
00:12:41.354 --> 00:12:43.454
Please stop it there!

201
00:12:43.454 --> 00:12:45.754
-What? -This man.

202
00:12:45.754 --> 00:12:48.054
What about him?

203
00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:50.954
If I remember correctly, he...

204
00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:59.554
So that's what it was!

205
00:12:59.554 --> 00:13:01.054
What this?

206
00:13:01.054 --> 00:13:05.254
About the thing that Pops forgot to tell you...

207
00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:08.254
I forgot to ask you about it!

208
00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:11.854
About reconsidering the eye-witness testimony,

209
00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:13.454
he said to do it from both the murder site

210
00:13:13.454 --> 00:13:15.754
as well as from the place it was witnessed from.

211
00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.454
Granny, you saw the culprit from this window

212
00:13:18.454 --> 00:13:21.554
through the window of the house over there, right?

213
00:13:21.554 --> 00:13:24.454
"Kane Yoshizawa (75), eye-witness" -Yes. It was really frightening.

214
00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:27.754
Thunder was roaring and there was a black-out.

215
00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:30.454
I casually happened to look out the window and...

216
00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:35.854
I couldn't make out his face,

217
00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:38.654
but I had a feeling that our eyes met.

218
00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:41.254
Then, suddenly...

219
00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:51.154
Why'd he throw the murder weapon towards the window?

220
00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:54.854
-No, but the murder weapon... -Huh?

221
00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:56.054
Right.

222
00:13:56.054 --> 00:13:58.054
The murder weapon was found not on the side of the window,

223
00:13:58.054 --> 00:14:00.854
but in front of the closet.

224
00:14:00.854 --> 00:14:02.354
Maybe you saw wrong.

225
00:14:02.354 --> 00:14:04.354
I've got good vision, you know.

226
00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:07.654
My eyesight hasn't changed since I was in my 30's.

227
00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:10.154
And, what happened after that?

228
00:14:10.154 --> 00:14:12.954
I didn't see anything after that,

229
00:14:12.954 --> 00:14:16.654
although lightning struck many times later too.

230
00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:18.554
I see!

231
00:14:18.554 --> 00:14:22.954
But if this is the truth, we're making a terrible mistake.

232
00:14:22.954 --> 00:14:24.554
Pops!

233
00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:36.035
Don't tell me, Inspector, that?

234
00:14:36.035 --> 00:14:38.835
Too bad, Mr. Mouri.

235
00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:41.035
It's almost time.

236
00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:42.735
Wait!

237
00:14:42.735 --> 00:14:44.435
There's still a little more time left.

238
00:14:44.435 --> 00:14:46.935
Answer me, Togashi. Did you really...

239
00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:49.035
You sure are persistent!

240
00:14:49.035 --> 00:14:51.335
Mr. Mouri, time's up.

241
00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:55.335
Togashi.

242
00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:02.835
-Henyo. -Are you all right, Pops?

243
00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.235
Come on, sit nicely!

244
00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:08.535
And Officer Takagi wanted to tell you this.

245
00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:10.335
It's about...

246
00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:14.435
I'm sorry to have intruded on you!

247
00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:18.035
What the heck is going on, letting out a strange cry?

248
00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:20.235
If it's as usual, after this...

249
00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:22.035
Please wait.

250
00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:24.335
There is more behind this case!

251
00:15:24.335 --> 00:15:27.235
Yes, yes! This is what happens!

252
00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:31.835
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

253
00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:34.735
I shall solve the case and show you the whole truth by 16:00,

254
00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.635
the time he is to be taken to the prosecutor!

255
00:15:39.135 --> 00:15:41.535
Okay, I'll let you handle it.

256
00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:42.635
No, but...

257
00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:45.535
It's as scheduled so there should be no problem.

258
00:15:45.535 --> 00:15:48.535
So, just what is behind this case?

259
00:15:48.535 --> 00:15:50.635
That there may in fact have been

260
00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:55.935
another person at the site of the murder.

261
00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:57.835
What?

262
00:15:57.835 --> 00:15:59.235
That can't be?

263
00:15:59.235 --> 00:16:03.235
Officer Takagi is checking the identity of this man right now.

264
00:16:03.235 --> 00:16:05.835
Don't tell me that you're saying that man is the culprit?

265
00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:07.335
It's ridiculous.

266
00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:10.135
We've got an eye-witness testifying that she saw him!

267
00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.135
She didn't see his face.

268
00:16:13.135 --> 00:16:15.435
That's true.

269
00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:18.635
Then, how would you explain the blood that was found on him?

270
00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:20.435
Forensics already got results that

271
00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:22.535
the blood matched that of the victim!

272
00:16:27.835 --> 00:16:30.035
Too bad, he's got a motive.

273
00:16:30.035 --> 00:16:31.435
Motive?

274
00:16:31.435 --> 00:16:34.935
It seems that the victim was what you call an evil parole supervisor.

275
00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:37.035
He seems to have gone around skilfully,

276
00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:38.735
so that he wouldn't be reported to the police

277
00:16:38.735 --> 00:16:40.935
and was squeezing money out of the criminal's family

278
00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:43.935
by picking on their weakness.

279
00:16:43.935 --> 00:16:46.335
Two years ago, your mother suffered

280
00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:50.135
because of this and died ill, didn't she?

281
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.635
So, after all, he did...

282
00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:57.235
No, if that's the motive, the other man fits right in too!

283
00:16:57.235 --> 00:16:58.735
His wife and child have committed

284
00:16:58.735 --> 00:17:01.435
after suffering the same ordeal!

285
00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:04.535
The man in view on the surveillance camera of the convenience store,

286
00:17:04.535 --> 00:17:07.135
Tsuneo Hakamada, age 34.

287
00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:11.035
He was released on parole yesterday together with Togashi.

288
00:17:11.035 --> 00:17:13.935
Moreover, Hakamada is left-handed.

289
00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:17.435
That explains why most of the wounds on the victim

290
00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:18.735
was concentrated on the right side.

291
00:17:18.735 --> 00:17:20.935
The eye-witness also said that

292
00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:24.735
the killer was holding the murder weapon in his left hand!

293
00:17:24.735 --> 00:17:27.035
Check where the man called Tsuneo Hakamada who was released on parole

294
00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:30.235
from Musashino Prison yesterday is!

295
00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:31.535
Yes, sir!

296
00:17:31.535 --> 00:17:32.635
Wrong!

297
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:35.135
Hakamada has nothing to do with this!

298
00:17:35.135 --> 00:17:37.935
It's me! I did it!

299
00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:43.335
What?

300
00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:46.335
Hakamada confessed to the crime?

301
00:17:46.335 --> 00:17:47.935
What?

302
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.535
Hakamada.

303
00:17:51.535 --> 00:17:53.335
Why...

304
00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:55.535
It's okay, Togashi.

305
00:17:55.535 --> 00:17:57.735
I was planning to turn myself

306
00:17:57.735 --> 00:17:59.935
after visiting the grave of my wife and child to begin with.

307
00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:01.535
So, there's no mistake about

308
00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:02.935
you being the one who committed the crime?

309
00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:04.335
Yeah.

310
00:18:04.335 --> 00:18:07.635
I got close to him inside prison

311
00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:11.535
and he found out about my plan to kill Sakuraba.

312
00:18:11.535 --> 00:18:13.835
I brushed Togashi who tried to stop me away,

313
00:18:13.835 --> 00:18:16.935
and somehow committed the murder.

314
00:18:16.935 --> 00:18:18.935
Then, Togashi who arrived at the scene of the murder,

315
00:18:18.935 --> 00:18:20.435
although surprised, told me to leave

316
00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:26.535
getting rid of the prints and all to him, and to flee.

317
00:18:26.535 --> 00:18:29.635
When I realized later, I had fled from the scene.

318
00:18:30.635 --> 00:18:33.435
Moreover, he ends up being arrested in my place.

319
00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:35.535
Talk about stupid.

320
00:18:39.335 --> 00:18:41.935
In other words, after he told Hakamada to flee,

321
00:18:41.935 --> 00:18:44.435
he didn't know where Hakamada had touched,

322
00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:48.135
so he decided to wipe all the prints off everything,

323
00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:49.535
including the things that the victim had touched.

324
00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:51.235
No doubt about it.

325
00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:53.235
Just as would be expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

326
00:18:53.235 --> 00:18:56.735
Thanks to you, we were spared arresting an innocent man!

327
00:18:56.735 --> 00:19:00.035
I wonder about that.

328
00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:01.635
Officer Takagi.

329
00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:04.735
What time was Hakamada seen on the surveillance camera?

330
00:19:04.735 --> 00:19:09.435
Uh, it was yesterday at 10:20.

331
00:19:09.435 --> 00:19:12.235
What? That's...

332
00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:15.135
Yes, that was the time...

333
00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:19.135
Mrs. Kane Yoshizawa witnessed the murder.

334
00:19:19.135 --> 00:19:20.835
Just what does that mean?

335
00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:24.635
Hakamada would've had to be in two places at the same time.

336
00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:27.035
But that's not possible, so...

337
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:29.835
Since Hakamada had blood on his clothes,

338
00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.735
there's no doubt that he was once at the murder site.

339
00:19:32.735 --> 00:19:37.435
But, after that, when he was witnessed from the house next door,

340
00:19:37.435 --> 00:19:40.035
he was no longer at the site.

341
00:19:40.035 --> 00:19:41.635
Officer Takagi.

342
00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:44.535
What did the eye-witness say? About the murder weapon?

343
00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:47.235
About the murder weapon?

344
00:19:47.235 --> 00:19:49.035
I couldn't make out his face,

345
00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:50.935
but I had a feeling that our eyes met.

346
00:19:50.935 --> 00:19:52.835
Then, suddenly...

347
00:19:54.535 --> 00:19:57.935
He threw the murder weapon at the eye-witness?

348
00:19:57.935 --> 00:20:00.435
Yes, but it's strange.

349
00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:03.635
The murder weapon wasn't found by the window,

350
00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:04.635
but rather among the shattered pieces of glass

351
00:20:04.635 --> 00:20:06.735
from the cracked mirror in front of the closet.

352
00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:10.635
In other words, the killer didn't throw the weapon at Kane,

353
00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:12.935
but rather, at the mirror.

354
00:20:12.935 --> 00:20:13.935
What?

355
00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:16.935
So, the eye-witness saw the figure of the culprit

356
00:20:16.935 --> 00:20:19.135
that was reflected in the mirror?

357
00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.635
Exactly! In other words,

358
00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:24.535
the murder weapon that was held in the killer's left hand

359
00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:26.935
was actually held in his right hand.

360
00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:28.335
What?

361
00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:30.035
And on the other hand,

362
00:20:30.035 --> 00:20:34.835
the killer was surprised at the witness who was reflected in the mirror

363
00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:36.735
and inadvertently threw the murder weapon at her,

364
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.935
cracking the mirror.

365
00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:40.035
In other words,

366
00:20:40.035 --> 00:20:43.135
the culprit who was witnessed at this time was right handed,

367
00:20:43.135 --> 00:20:47.235
and the culprit who fled earlier was left handed.

368
00:20:47.235 --> 00:20:48.235
Hold it.

369
00:20:48.235 --> 00:20:51.335
Does that mean that the victim was killed twice?

370
00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:54.135
There is only one thinkable answer.

371
00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:57.535
The victim once thought to be dead, came to again

372
00:20:57.535 --> 00:21:01.135
and was actually killed by the other person who was there!

373
00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:04.335
What?

374
00:21:04.335 --> 00:21:09.235
That culprit was indeed you, Togashi!

375
00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:14.635
I just couldn't forgive that guy

376
00:21:14.635 --> 00:21:19.735
for the suffering he put our families through.

377
00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:23.135
I just couldn't forgive him!

378
00:21:26.235 --> 00:21:30.735
The long day in the interrogation room is over.

379
00:22:52.935 --> 00:22:56.035
I wish you told me the truth when I sat together with you

380
00:22:56.035 --> 00:22:59.535
in the interrogation room yesterday, Togashi.

381
00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:05.335
Well, I guess you couldn't tell a no good detective that didn't even know

382
00:23:05.335 --> 00:23:07.935
that your mother had passed away, though.

383
00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:13.835
I was afraid to tell the truth, so I just couldn't.

384
00:23:13.835 --> 00:23:16.035
But thanks to you,

385
00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:18.735
I was able to not make a scapegoat out of Hakamada.

386
00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:20.235
Thank you very much!

387
00:23:20.235 --> 00:23:23.335
What? Me again?

388
00:23:24.635 --> 00:23:27.435
My memory in that area is not...

389
00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:29.435
Well, I guess, that's the story!

390
00:23:35.835 --> 00:23:38.235
Ran, contact Eri, will you?

391
00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:39.935
Call mother?

392
00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:41.135
Don't tell me that...

393
00:23:41.135 --> 00:23:43.535
It's nothing like that.

394
00:23:43.535 --> 00:23:45.735
You're going to ask her to act as Mr. Togashi's attorney, right?

395
00:23:45.735 --> 00:23:47.435
I know.

396
00:23:47.435 --> 00:23:51.435
But, while we're at it anyway, why not go eat with her or something?

397
00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:53.635
If she insists we do, I guess why not while we're at it,

398
00:23:53.635 --> 00:23:55.535
because it's not such a bad idea.

399
00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:56.935
Hey, hey.

400
00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.835
Using too many phrases like "if she insists" or "while we're at it"

401
00:23:58.835 --> 00:24:00.735
may get you in trouble.

402
00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:05.335
Talk about scary!

403
00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:11.135
"Next Episode" -Anyway, how did you sprain your ankle?

404
00:24:11.135 --> 00:24:13.635
I don't want to tell you about it!

405
00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:15.635
A girl?

406
00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:19.835
It seems like she ran away from the culprit and bumped into Ran,

407
00:24:19.835 --> 00:24:22.835
and they're on the run together!

408
00:24:22.835 --> 00:24:26.535
Ran. Why aren't you contacting us at all?

409
00:24:26.535 --> 00:24:28.635
Haruna!

410
00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:31.735
Let that girl go!

411
00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:37.059
Next Conan, "Stork Mystery Tour (Ran's Search)"

412
00:24:53.188 --> 00:24:55.088
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:55.088 --> 00:24:57.288
"Letter"

414
00:24:57.288 --> 00:24:58.688
The stage for the next episode is Kinosaki Spa in Hyogo prefecture.

415
00:24:58.688 --> 00:24:59.988
I guess I'll go take a dip in the spa, too.

416
00:24:59.988 --> 00:25:02.376
-You have to stay back here, Inspector. -What?
