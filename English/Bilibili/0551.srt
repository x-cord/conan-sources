1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.840
Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest?

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
Is your father going to enter that contest?

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.940
Yeah, it seems he made it through the "pry Mary entree"!

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.640
Pry Mary entree?

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.040
What's that?

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.940
He passed the primary entry.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.340
The judges look through the pictures

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.740
and profile that the candidates send in

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.740
and narrow down the contestants.

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.940
My Dad is a real man

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.440
so it was already certain that he would be chosen.

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.040
I've never met him,

13
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.440
but I'll bet he's the typical "you know" type.

14
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.740
And? If he wins the contest,

15
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.240
does he get anything?

16
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.940
In the letter that he got from them,

17
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.340
it said that he would get money.

18
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.340
If I remember correctly,

19
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.340
there were 7 zeros after the number 1.

20
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.040
7 zeros.

21
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.040
That's 10,000,000 yen!

22
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.640
Wow!

23
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.040
Who planned it?

24
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
Whose plan?

25
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.940
Who sent him the letter? Who is it?

26
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.640
Nichiuri TV was written on it.

27
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.840
But it seems that Dad's more interested

28
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.640
in the wild boar hanging scroll

29
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.040
that comes with the money more than the money.

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.540
If it's really from Nichiuri TV,

31
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540
I guess it's not a fraud or anything.

32
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.340
It's quite a large sum of money.

33
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.240
You mean it's a drawing of a wild boar?

34
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240
Yeah. I saw the picture in the letter

35
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.340
and it was a black and white drawing.

36
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.040
I didn't think that it was all that great,

37
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.140
but Dad liked wild boars from before

38
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.840
and said that he wanted to decorate it in the alcove.

39
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.940
He said that he liked it

40
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.440
also because the artist's name read "thank you"!

41
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.040
"Thank you"?

42
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.340
Genta, it could be that the money

43
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.240
is what comes along with the picture.

44
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.440
What?

45
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.640
You mean the 10,000,000 is what comes along with the drawing?

46
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.840
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

47
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.340
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

48
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.340
An unexpected turn of events.

49
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.540
Genta's father is thought to be the culprit and is in a fix.

50
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

53
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.670
"The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 1)"

54
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.370
What? It's worth 50,000,000 yen?

55
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.670
You mean this hanging scroll?

56
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.670
Yeah. If it's really a black and white hanging scroll

57
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.670
drawn by the renown Sankyu Shonin.

58
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.070
I have a feeling I've seen this picture somewhere before.

59
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.170
Me too.

60
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.770
Dad said the same thing too.

61
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.970
This is the wild boar of Hagi.

62
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.770
It's one of the pictures seen in the card game called Hana Fuda.

63
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.370
And why is this picture of Hana Fuda so valuable?

64
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.570
Yeah. When that hanging scroll was first discovered,

65
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.970
it was said that the drawing

66
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.270
was a no-good piece that Sankyu drew as a joke.

67
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.070
But, later, the hanging scroll of a deer

68
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.570
and butterfly were also found,

69
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.770
and the value of the drawing soar up.

70
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.270
Because with the three together

71
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.570
"wild boar, deer, and butterfly",

72
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.870
it was said to bring good luck.

73
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.770
In fact, it's said that a businessman of Iwate

74
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.670
who purchased the three scrolls

75
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.170
investing all the money that he had,

76
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.070
succeeded and built financial status for himself.

77
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.170
And since then, that's how much the scrolls are worth.

78
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.570
So, it's indeed a hanging scroll that brings happiness.

79
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.470
But, since one of them is the award,

80
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.970
that businessman must've let go of the drawings.

81
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.470
No, if he let them go,

82
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.570
I'm sure it would've made the news,

83
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.470
so I'm sure he still has them.

84
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.870
I wonder what the name of that businessman was?

85
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.270
Gonsaku Kojima.

86
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.370
He's the chairman of the Kojima group

87
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.770
as well as the sponsor of this Mr. Kojima Contest.

88
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.670
You mean the super rich Kojima group

89
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.970
that owns a lot of things

90
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.670
like railroads and department stores?

91
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.670
Right. After losing two out of the three hanging scrolls,

92
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.370
it was no use holding on to just one,

93
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.970
so it was written in the chairman's blog

94
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.870
that he decided to set up this plan

95
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.870
to give it to someone.

96
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.870
And if so, he wanted to give it to someone

97
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.770
who had the same name as he, Kojima.

98
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.470
You're lucky you're a Kojima!

99
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.470
Then, the letter asking you to make entry

100
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.870
came directly to your house, Genta?

101
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.770
No. We were invited to come by another Kojima

102
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.170
who lives in the neighborhood.

103
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.670
He told us that he saw Kojimas

104
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.370
being asked to come together on the internet,

105
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.270
so he asked my Dad to enter too.

106
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.970
Then, what do you have to do to win?

107
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.270
A lot of stuff was written.

108
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.370
Physical endurance contest, singing contest

109
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.470
and even a Kanji character dictation test.

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.670
I see.

111
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.370
He wants to choose a well-rounded almighty Mr. Kojima.

112
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.270
Looks like it's going to be tough.

113
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.070
But, he can sing.

114
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.870
He's far better than Conan.

115
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.270
Hey, isn't that hurdle a bit too low?

116
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.870
Is your father going to be okay, Genta?

117
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.870
Nothing's for sure.

118
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.170
Then, I guess the one who scores the highest

119
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.170
in all three of those matches will be the winner.

120
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.870
No, there's more to it.

121
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.170
The ones who make it through

122
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.070
will all gather in Studio 5

123
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.270
and the winner will be determined

124
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.170
after answering a quiz in front of the audience.

125
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.970
OK. All 5 will move.

126
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.070
I see, the final contest is going to be who answers

127
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.770
the fastest quiz contest.

128
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.870
They're the Mr. Kojimas who are competing in the contest.

129
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.970
How's the contest coming along?

130
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.970
How's it going, oh bummers!

131
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.070
The match is only about

132
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.470
how many push-ups you can do in three minutes.

133
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.970
I really tried hard

134
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.570
and did 180 sit up but didn't make it.

135
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.270
Well, anybody who makes it through

136
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.970
is a monster.

137
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.370
I'm sure your father'll do okay, though, Genta.

138
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.070
Yeah. He can do it hands down.

139
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.370
There's a different group of Kojimas coming this way.

140
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.070
I didn't think that I'd be disqualified singing.

141
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.370
Well, it can't be helped

142
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.970
because even he who won successive awards

143
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.170
in singing contests didn't make it.

144
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.170
Don't get so depressed.

145
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.570
In order to make it through this contest,

146
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.370
you've got to have the singing ability of Elvis Presley.

147
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.970
Pruse Lee? Did he means the one that comes out in Kung-Fu movies.

148
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.070
That's Bruce Lee you're talking about.

149
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.470
They're talking about Elvis Presley,

150
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.970
the King of Rock and Roll.

151
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.670
Is your father really going to be all right, Genta?

152
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.570
Yeah. I think so.

153
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.970
Darn! Why? How come?

154
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.970
Hey, cool it!

155
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.870
Yet another group.

156
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.570
Because don't you think it's funny?

157
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.270
I've reached Level 1 in the kanji writing test, you know,

158
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.570
so how could I flunk the kanji dictation test?

159
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.070
I answered the test perfectly and yet.

160
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.770
It's just that you didn't answer it perfectly.

161
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.470
Then, can you write?

162
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.170
The kanji character for "rose" or "melancholy"?

163
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.270
Well, no.

164
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.670
Hey, Genta, your father...

165
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.970
He probably...

166
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.370
won't make it.

167
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.170
The phone.

168
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.970
It's from my Dad.

169
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.970
What?

170
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.070
Hello. This is Genta.

171
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.570
What? No joke?

172
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.070
You made it to the three finalists?

173
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.470
Really?

174
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.570
That's amazing.

175
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.270
Everybody's here rooting for you,

176
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.570
so give it your best shot!

177
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.170
But, it's strange.

178
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.770
There are 5 seats for the quick pushing quiz

179
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.270
and yet I wonder why only 3 people made it?

180
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.570
"Evaluation Room" -Chairman Kojima.

181
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.070
We got a complaint from the producer of the TV station,

182
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.270
saying that the program is meaningless

183
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.370
the way things are going.

184
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.870
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -Never mind.

185
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.670
"Chairman of the Kojima Group" -By the way,

186
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.670
did you show it to the three finalists?

187
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.770
I'm asking you if you showed them the paper

188
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.970
that we secretly prepared?

189
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.370
Oh, yes.

190
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.670
But, all three of them answered differently.

191
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.470
Who cares.

192
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.270
Tell me how they read it.

193
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.070
"Bunta Kojima (33)" -Contestant number 35, Mr. Bunta Kojima's answer

194
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.170
was "Hapyakuichi" (801).

195
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.570
"Genji Kojima (32)" -Contestant number 84, Mr. Genji Kojima

196
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.270
answered "Shakuhachi" (Bamboo flute).

197
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.870
"Gankichi Kojima (34)" -Contestant number 147, Mr. Gankichi Kojima

198
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.670
answered "Ippin" (First class).

199
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.270
Chairman?

200
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.870
He's finally disclosed himself.

201
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.370
Disclosed himself?

202
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.470
Using all that money was all worthwhile.

203
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.670
What?

204
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.470
Where's that paper now?

205
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.070
Oh, yes.

206
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.870
Here in this envelope.

207
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.170
Good.

208
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.070
I'll take care of everything from here.

209
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.770
You may go now.

210
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.070
But, chairman...

211
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.170
I'm going in person

212
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.370
to the waiting room to welcome

213
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.970
the honourable winner of the Mr. Kojima contest.

214
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.670
"Nationwide Mr.Kojima Contest"

215
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.570
It's almost time.

216
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.970
I wish my Dad'll come out quickly.

217
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.570
There he is.

218
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.170
Isn't that the staff of Nichiuri TV?

219
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.070
I guess so.

220
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.270
We are very sorry to announce

221
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.070
that this Mr. Kojima contest has been cancelled

222
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.770
due to reasons on our side.

223
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.970
What?

224
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.470
-Hey! You've gotta be kidding! -What do you mean?

225
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.170
The stain on his sleeve...

226
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.170
Isn't that a blood stain?

227
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.770
I'll go check.

228
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.770
Conan?

229
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.770
You guys stay where you are and don't move!

230
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.270
Chairman!

231
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.370
Chairman? Chairman Kojima?

232
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.870
Hey, did you call the ambulance?

233
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.470
Yes. They should be here in 10 minutes.

234
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.670
What happened?

235
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.270
It seems he tripped and fell down the stairs.

236
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.170
Did you see him fall?

237
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.270
No, I heard a loud sound together with his scream,

238
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.670
so I rushed over

239
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.770
and found the chairman lying on the floor alone.

240
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.770
Then, you'd better call the police too.

241
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.570
-The police? -See, look at the chairman's right hand.

242
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.170
He's holding a piece of paper.

243
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.970
If a person is about to trip and fall from the stairs,

244
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.270
it's unnatural for the person to be holding the paper, wouldn't it?

245
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.870
When he was about to fall,

246
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.970
the chairman grabbed the piece of paper

247
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.370
that the person who was next to him was holding.

248
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.570
Or he fought for the piece of paper with someone

249
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.470
and mistakenly fell.

250
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.770
I see.

251
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.170
Where's the staff member that announced

252
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.770
the contest would be cancelled a while ago?

253
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.870
He seemed to have a blood stain on his sleeve.

254
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.870
He rushed over to the chairman with us and tried to carry him up,

255
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.170
so maybe that's when the blood stained his sleeve.

256
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.870
At any rate, when the chairman fell from the stairs,

257
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.470
someone should've been with him.

258
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.470
And yet when you all rushed over to him,

259
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.570
that person was gone together with the piece of paper,

260
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.670
means that it's almost unmistakable

261
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.970
that the person was the cause of the fall and fled.

262
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:19.970
But...

263
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.370
Who are you?

264
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.770
Oh, well...

265
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.670
Maybe that someone could be

266
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.870
one of the three finalists.

267
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.270
The chairman said,

268
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.470
"I'm going in person to the waiting room

269
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.770
to welcome the honorable winner."

270
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.870
That's why I was waiting in another room together with the staff.

271
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.970
Hey... Don't tell me that the three finalists include...

272
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.870
What's the entire racket here about?

273
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.270
Is anything the matter?

274
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.970
I don't know what's going on,

275
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.670
but I wish they'd hurry and let us do the last quiz?

276
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.470
I'm tired of waiting already.

277
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.170
Don't tell me that Genta's father

278
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.270
is also considered one of the suspects too?

279
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.870
Who among these three

280
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.570
is Genta's father?

281
00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:30.909
The victim is Mr. Gonsaku Kojima, age 71.

282
00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:32.509
He's the chairman of the Kojima Group,

283
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:34.609
and he seems to have come here today

284
00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:38.509
to serve as the head judge for this special TV program.

285
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:40.009
Head judge?

286
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:41.009
Yes.

287
00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:44.209
It's a program called "Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

288
00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:48.409
that Chairman Kojima himself planned and sponsored.

289
00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:52.809
The winner was scheduled to receive a gorgeous award.

290
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:56.409
But from the looks of it, it looks like an accident

291
00:14:56.409 --> 00:14:59.809
in which he tripped and fell off the stairs.

292
00:15:03.609 --> 00:15:05.109
It seems that this is not something for us,

293
00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:07.309
the 1st division to cover.

294
00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:09.009
I guess not.

295
00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.909
Why'd you call us?

296
00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:12.809
You're the one who called

297
00:15:12.809 --> 00:15:16.109
asking to talk to me directly, aren't you?

298
00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:17.809
-The paper. -Paper?

299
00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:20.209
When we the staff rushed over,

300
00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:22.609
the Chairman was bleeding from his head,

301
00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:24.909
holding a piece of torn paper

302
00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:26.509
and lying on the floor.

303
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.009
When a person is about to fall off the stairs,

304
00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:31.009
do you think he'd hold a paper in his hand?

305
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:32.609
No.

306
00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:34.909
So, when the chairman fell,

307
00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:36.409
there must've been someone near him,

308
00:15:36.409 --> 00:15:39.609
and he at the spur of the moment grabbed that piece of paper.

309
00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:42.809
Or he fought for the paper with someone

310
00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:45.809
and accidentally fell off the stairs, right?

311
00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:48.709
But, when the Chairman was found lying on the floor

312
00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:51.209
there was no one near him,

313
00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:53.209
so we thought that maybe there was a person

314
00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:55.709
who left the chairman who fell off the way he is

315
00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:58.809
and ran off with the torn piece of paper.

316
00:15:58.809 --> 00:16:02.009
If so, we could have a case.

317
00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:03.609
But, how amazing.

318
00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:04.609
To deduce things that far

319
00:16:04.609 --> 00:16:06.709
and call an officer of the 1st division.

320
00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:11.209
Oh, it wasn't us,

321
00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:13.709
but rather that little boy who told us

322
00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:15.809
to call Officer Takagi of the Metropolitan Police.

323
00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.509
Are you sure you really don't know?

324
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:19.709
You're the Chairman's secretary, aren't you?

325
00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:23.309
But I was told by the Chairman not to look at it, so...

326
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:25.809
Conan?

327
00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:28.309
So, it's this pattern again.

328
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:32.809
I really don't know what was written on that paper.

329
00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:35.809
Besides, I kept it for him in this envelope all the while.

330
00:16:37.109 --> 00:16:39.809
Are you referring to the paper

331
00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:42.909
that the Chairman was holding in his hand?

332
00:16:42.909 --> 00:16:44.909
Yes, Sir. Most probably...

333
00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:47.309
That paper is a Japanese paper

334
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:49.909
that the Chairman uses on special occasions.

335
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:52.309
I got a glimpse of the paper

336
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:55.509
when the chairman was putting it in the envelope.

337
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:59.309
But, I only had that paper on me temporarily,

338
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:02.809
and I gave it back to the chairman just before we parted,

339
00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:05.009
with the paper still in the envelope.

340
00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:08.009
An empty envelope was found on the corpse,

341
00:17:08.009 --> 00:17:09.709
so I believe he's telling the truth.

342
00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.409
But, why were holding it for him?

343
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:14.609
So that I could show it to the three.

344
00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:15.709
The three?

345
00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:19.009
The three finalists of the Mr. Kojima contest.

346
00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:21.909
There they are.

347
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:24.109
Mr. Kojima contest?

348
00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.709
By the way, how were they chosen?

349
00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:29.809
Mr. Kojima's nationwide were called upon on the net,

350
00:17:29.809 --> 00:17:31.009
and of all the people who entered,

351
00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.409
the candidates were narrowed down to 200,

352
00:17:32.409 --> 00:17:35.409
who qualified to enter the contest.

353
00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:38.209
They had to compete doing exercise, such as the number of push ups

354
00:17:38.209 --> 00:17:39.909
they could finish in three minutes.

355
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:41.309
Sing songs in a singing contest

356
00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:42.909
to test their singing ability,

357
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:45.109
and compete in a kanji dictation test

358
00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:47.409
to test their intelligence.

359
00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:48.809
I see.

360
00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:52.609
So, those three men have intelligence

361
00:17:52.609 --> 00:17:55.209
are physically fit and sing well.

362
00:17:55.209 --> 00:17:57.109
Yes, in a way...

363
00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.809
In a way?

364
00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:01.309
And, what did he want you to do

365
00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:03.309
after showing the three

366
00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:04.909
the paper with the question on it?

367
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:07.009
Well...

368
00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:09.009
He just simply wanted me

369
00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:12.009
to ask them how they read the kanji.

370
00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:13.309
Oh, I see.

371
00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:16.409
But, all three answered differently.

372
00:18:16.409 --> 00:18:17.709
Differently?

373
00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:20.909
Was some kind of code written on it?

374
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:24.509
No. All three answered almost immediately,

375
00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.209
so I don't think the words were all that difficult.

376
00:18:27.209 --> 00:18:30.509
Contestant number 35, Mr. Bunta Kojima answered

377
00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.809
"Hapyakuichi" (801).

378
00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:36.009
Number 84, Mr. Genji Kojima answered

379
00:18:36.009 --> 00:18:38.309
"Shakuhachi" (Bamboo fluter).

380
00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:42.509
And number 147, Mr. Gankichi Kojima

381
00:18:42.509 --> 00:18:45.809
answered "Ippin" (First class).

382
00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:48.709
The three truly did answer differently.

383
00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:51.509
Did you really show them all the same piece of paper?

384
00:18:51.509 --> 00:18:53.909
Yes, I did.

385
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:57.109
When I told the chairman what the answers of the three were,

386
00:18:57.109 --> 00:19:00.009
this is what he mumbled...

387
00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:03.609
He's finally disclosed his true self.

388
00:19:05.209 --> 00:19:06.609
Disclosed his true self?

389
00:19:06.609 --> 00:19:11.009
Then he took the envelope with the paper inside it from me

390
00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:15.109
and said that he was going to the waiting room in person

391
00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:17.609
to welcome the winner of the Mr. Kojima contest.

392
00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:19.309
I see. In other words,

393
00:19:19.309 --> 00:19:23.109
he chose the winner after hearing the answers of the finalists?

394
00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:25.009
Yes.

395
00:19:25.009 --> 00:19:26.109
But, it seems strange for him to say,

396
00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:30.009
"He's finally disclosed himself."

397
00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:33.809
And he went to the winner's waiting room?

398
00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:37.209
Yes, he told me to leave,

399
00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.609
so I was in another room where the staff were

400
00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:42.309
when I heard the chairman scream and a loud sound.

401
00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:44.109
Inspector Megure!

402
00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:45.709
Oh, Chiba!

403
00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:47.309
I got this story

404
00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:50.009
from the others who entered this contest.

405
00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:51.509
The floor above these stairs

406
00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:55.109
is where the waiting room for the finalists of this contest is.

407
00:19:55.109 --> 00:19:57.109
It seems that the only ones who were on that floor

408
00:19:57.109 --> 00:20:00.809
when the chairman fell were the three finalists.

409
00:20:00.809 --> 00:20:03.609
Were all three in the same room?

410
00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:07.309
No, they were all in separate rooms of their own.

411
00:20:07.309 --> 00:20:10.609
Moreover, the elevator to that floor was being checked at that time,

412
00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:14.509
so anyone who went outside used the stairs to go downstairs.

413
00:20:14.509 --> 00:20:18.009
In other words, if when the staff rushed over,

414
00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:21.609
there was no one near the chairman who was lying on the floor,

415
00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:23.409
it's highly likely that one of the finalists

416
00:20:23.409 --> 00:20:26.109
after pushing the chairman off the stairs,

417
00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:31.609
went back to his room again.

418
00:20:31.609 --> 00:20:34.209
I guess we'll listen to what they have to say individually.

419
00:20:34.209 --> 00:20:37.009
-Yes, sir! -Oh, Officer Takagi.

420
00:20:38.009 --> 00:20:39.509
When you listen to what they have to say,

421
00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.609
I'd like you to ask them several other things too.

422
00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:44.309
How unusual.

423
00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:45.809
You usually come along secretly

424
00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:47.509
and ask them without asking for permission.

425
00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:49.709
Well, you see...

426
00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:51.209
What is it?

427
00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:57.809
What? Genta's father is among the three?

428
00:20:57.809 --> 00:20:59.609
Which... which one is he?

429
00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:02.309
I don't know because I've never met him.

430
00:21:02.309 --> 00:21:07.309
Maybe he knows me by photos or something, though.

431
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:09.909
Then, I can find out right away if I ask.

432
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:11.309
I'll talk to Inspector Megure

433
00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:13.109
and have him taken off the list of suspects.

434
00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:15.709
No! Holmes also said,

435
00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:17.509
"Emotional qualities at times

436
00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:21.709
can interfere deduction carrying you away from the truth".

437
00:21:21.709 --> 00:21:23.309
We can't be 100% sure that he's not a suspect

438
00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:26.909
just because he's Genta's father, can we?

439
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:28.709
If you want to make a composed deduction,

440
00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:31.109
I don't think you should ask.

441
00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:35.009
So, could you ask them what I ask you to ask them, in my place?

442
00:21:35.009 --> 00:21:36.909
Okay.

443
00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:41.309
Maybe those three

444
00:21:41.309 --> 00:21:44.109
didn't really win their way through the contest.

445
00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:45.509
What?

446
00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:50.109
"Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

447
00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:53.609
Conan sure is late, isn't he?

448
00:21:53.609 --> 00:21:56.809
-Yeah. -Maybe something happened after all.

449
00:21:56.809 --> 00:21:59.609
I can hear the sound of the ambulance and police cars.

450
00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:03.709
Then, shall we go to check out how things are?

451
00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:05.509
-Right! -Yes.

452
00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:08.509
-Let's go... -Don't!

453
00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:12.409
Conan told you all to stay put right here, didn't he?

454
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:15.409
That's true, but...

455
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:18.409
But if this is a homicide,

456
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:22.009
Genta's father may be involved too.

457
00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:23.409
That's why, the more so.

458
00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:25.709
If he just got mixed up in this,

459
00:22:25.709 --> 00:22:28.909
Conan would probably contact us saying not to worry,

460
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:30.909
but if not...

461
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:36.209
It's highly likely that he's also a suspect for something.

462
00:22:36.209 --> 00:22:38.709
Genta's father.

463
00:22:38.709 --> 00:22:40.809
What?

464
00:22:43.409 --> 00:22:45.209
Dad.

465
00:24:06.209 --> 00:24:08.009
"Next Episode" -From the chairman's bag

466
00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:09.809
that was found in the judge's room

467
00:24:09.809 --> 00:24:11.409
a gun was found!

468
00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:12.909
What?

469
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:15.109
Hyakkiyako?

470
00:24:15.109 --> 00:24:17.809
Is it mean the group of killer robbers?

471
00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:19.509
That's right.

472
00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:22.509
He was planning on avenging

473
00:24:22.509 --> 00:24:24.609
the death of his pet dog.

474
00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:28.209
I'll go check after all!

475
00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:30.209
Genta!

476
00:24:30.209 --> 00:24:35.725
Next Conan, "The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 2)"

477
00:24:51.487 --> 00:24:53.987
Next Conan's Hint:

478
00:24:53.987 --> 00:24:55.987
"Edoite"

479
00:24:55.987 --> 00:24:58.287
My Dad is handsome, so he's not the culprit.

480
00:24:58.287 --> 00:24:59.687
What kind of logic is that?

481
00:24:59.687 --> 00:25:00.750
Really.
