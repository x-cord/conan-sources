1
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.640
Mifuyu, good morning.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.340
"Ayano Saeki (25)"

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.440
"Morita" -Tabata, what are you doing?

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.540
Please stop, Tabata!

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.040
Mifuyu! What's wrong, Mifuyu?

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.940
Are you okay? Mifuyu!

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.140
Mifuyu.

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.240
Mifuyu!

9
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.540
Mifuyu!

10
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.940
Mifuyu, hang in there!

11
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.640
Tabata.

12
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.540
Tabata? Did Tabata stab you?

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.240
Run...

14
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.940
Tabata is still...

15
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.140
Mifuyu! Hang in there, Mifuyu!

16
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.740
Mifuyu!

17
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.340
Run...

18
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.440
Tabata is still...

19
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.140
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

20
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.040
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

21
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.040
A murder occurs in a woman's apartment!

22
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.940
What on earth happened in there?

23
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.240
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:42.897
"The Real Perp's Scream"

27
00:03:43.997 --> 00:03:45.797
It stopped raining.

28
00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:46.897
Yeah.

29
00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:50.097
Anyway, I wanted to get lunch at Cafe Poirot.

30
00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:51.897
I can't believe they were closed.

31
00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:55.697
Kid, is there anything you want to...

32
00:03:57.997 --> 00:03:59.697
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:03.297
Miss, why are you in such a hurry?

34
00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:04.797
You look pale, too.

35
00:04:04.797 --> 00:04:06.497
Are you not feeling well?

36
00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:11.097
Is that blood on your right shoulder?

37
00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:13.797
Actually,

38
00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:16.997
Mifuyu, my friend, was stabbed by her boyfriend!

39
00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:18.097
What?

40
00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:24.097
This is her apartment.

41
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.097
Wait!

42
00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:29.097
The perp might still be inside.

43
00:04:33.297 --> 00:04:35.697
Hey. Is anyone there?

44
00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:40.397
Stay here.

45
00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:55.097
Miss, come in.

46
00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:56.297
Okay.

47
00:04:58.497 --> 00:04:59.897
Why?

48
00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:04.197
Is this really where your friend was stabbed in the chest and died?

49
00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:06.797
It's true! It really...

50
00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:08.297
Pops.

51
00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:10.397
Do you think this knife is the weapon?

52
00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:12.497
There's blood on it.

53
00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:14.597
And over here...

54
00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:18.597
there are footprints leading in from and out to the balcony.

55
00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:23.197
But a body can't just disappear on its own.

56
00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:28.297
What's going on?

57
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:31.497
Are you certain the deceased

58
00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:36.297
is the resident of this apartment, Mifuyu Morita?

59
00:05:36.297 --> 00:05:37.397
Yes.

60
00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:39.897
How do you know Ms. Mifuyu?

61
00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:43.497
We worked together at the bakery by the station.

62
00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:46.697
Today, Mifuyu invited me to hang out.

63
00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:48.797
When I came at the time we agreed upon...

64
00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:52.497
She heard the window break and someone scream,

65
00:05:52.497 --> 00:05:54.897
"Please stop, Tabata!"

66
00:05:54.897 --> 00:05:57.797
So Ayano, who had been told where the spare key was hidden,

67
00:05:57.797 --> 00:06:00.597
unlocked and entered the apartment,

68
00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:03.097
where she saw Mifuyu with a knife in her chest,

69
00:06:03.097 --> 00:06:08.397
who said, "Watch out! Run!" and died.

70
00:06:09.797 --> 00:06:13.097
I heard a noise from the balcony.

71
00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:16.797
I was scared, so I ran.

72
00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:22.597
So the perp was still hiding on the balcony then.

73
00:06:22.597 --> 00:06:25.197
Who is Tabata?

74
00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:27.997
The man Mifuyu was dating.

75
00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:31.297
Is this him?

76
00:06:31.297 --> 00:06:32.797
Yes, that's him.

77
00:06:32.797 --> 00:06:35.197
That's Mifuyu and Tabata.

78
00:06:35.197 --> 00:06:38.397
They met about three months ago.

79
00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:43.997
Someday I'd like to open a bakery cafe in Paris.

80
00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:47.897
"Atsushi Tabata (35)" -Really? What a wonderful dream.

81
00:06:47.897 --> 00:06:48.997
Yeah.

82
00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:52.197
"Mifuyu Morita (25)" -I'm working hard to save money so I can do that.

83
00:06:52.197 --> 00:06:55.297
I can provide a little help.

84
00:06:55.297 --> 00:06:57.497
Are you sure, Tabata?

85
00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:02.297
We're dating, aren't we?

86
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.597
Tabata...

87
00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:07.097
But shortly after that,

88
00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:09.397
he said he was having trouble with a client

89
00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:12.097
and needed money urgently.

90
00:07:13.297 --> 00:07:16.497
Sounds like a typical romance scam.

91
00:07:16.497 --> 00:07:19.597
Did Mifuyu give him money?

92
00:07:19.597 --> 00:07:22.397
Yes, about 10 million yen.

93
00:07:22.397 --> 00:07:24.497
-10 million yen? -10 million yen?

94
00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:29.297
But Tabata, not realizing I was Mifuyu's friend,

95
00:07:29.297 --> 00:07:32.497
tried to approach me with the same story.

96
00:07:32.497 --> 00:07:35.597
When I told Mifuyu about it, she said she would sue him.

97
00:07:35.597 --> 00:07:39.097
So Tabata came to silence her.

98
00:07:39.097 --> 00:07:40.997
Also, Ayano,

99
00:07:40.997 --> 00:07:46.197
the blood on the knife and floor were type B.

100
00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:49.397
Do you know Mifuyu's blood type?

101
00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:51.697
Yes. It's type B.

102
00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:55.097
One more thing,

103
00:07:55.097 --> 00:07:59.497
we found this piece of paper in the trash can here.

104
00:07:59.497 --> 00:08:02.397
Do these numbers mean anything to you?

105
00:08:02.397 --> 00:08:05.197
I don't know.

106
00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:07.097
293?

107
00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:18.097
It wouldn't be impossible to enter and exit from this height.

108
00:08:21.497 --> 00:08:22.697
What's this?

109
00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:36.697
Hey! Quit wandering around!

110
00:08:36.697 --> 00:08:38.597
Sorry.

111
00:08:38.597 --> 00:08:40.397
-Huh? -Is something wrong?

112
00:08:40.397 --> 00:08:42.597
Her suitcase is missing.

113
00:08:42.597 --> 00:08:46.597
She always kept a large suitcase in there.

114
00:08:46.597 --> 00:08:47.797
That's it!

115
00:08:47.797 --> 00:08:50.797
Tabata used that suitcase.

116
00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:53.197
This is what happened, Inspector.

117
00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:56.097
Tabata entered the room from the balcony by breaking the window

118
00:08:56.097 --> 00:08:59.197
and murdered Mifuyu by stabbing her with a knife.

119
00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:01.497
However, before he could move the body,

120
00:09:01.497 --> 00:09:03.697
Ayano arrived.

121
00:09:03.697 --> 00:09:05.397
So he hid on the balcony

122
00:09:05.397 --> 00:09:07.697
and while Ayano was gone,

123
00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:11.397
he put the body in the suitcase and took it away.

124
00:09:11.397 --> 00:09:12.797
I see.

125
00:09:12.797 --> 00:09:14.797
Canvas the area to see

126
00:09:14.797 --> 00:09:18.797
if anyone saw a suspicious man carrying a suitcase.

127
00:09:18.797 --> 00:09:20.897
Let's go to Tabata's house.

128
00:09:20.897 --> 00:09:21.897
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:31.997 --> 00:09:33.797
Hello, Inspector.

130
00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:34.997
Hello.

131
00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:37.897
This is Atsushi Tabata's house?

132
00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:38.997
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:39.997
Inspector!

134
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.997
There are footprints here.

135
00:09:44.697 --> 00:09:48.697
They seem to be the same as the ones in Mifuyu's apartment.

136
00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:52.397
And these tracks are from the wheels on the suitcase.

137
00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:55.397
Tabata must've put the body in the suitcase

138
00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:57.097
and brought it here.

139
00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.097
"Tabata"

140
00:09:59.097 --> 00:10:02.097
Tabata, are you home?

141
00:10:06.297 --> 00:10:07.697
It's unlocked.

142
00:10:07.697 --> 00:10:10.497
Hey, there's blood on those shoes.

143
00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:14.097
These are the shoes.

144
00:10:14.097 --> 00:10:18.197
The blood must've gotten on them when he murdered Mifuyu.

145
00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:19.397
Yeah.

146
00:10:22.397 --> 00:10:23.497
Tabata?

147
00:10:24.597 --> 00:10:25.697
He's not here?

148
00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:29.697
Tabata!

149
00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:34.197
What's the meaning of this?

150
00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:50.064
This smell...

151
00:10:50.064 --> 00:10:53.364
I believe he was poisoned.

152
00:10:54.664 --> 00:10:58.564
It may have been in the coffee left on the table.

153
00:10:58.564 --> 00:11:00.564
That piece of paper.

154
00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:03.364
This is...

155
00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:04.864
What is it?

156
00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:08.064
I will go to see Mifuyu.

157
00:11:08.064 --> 00:11:09.464
Atsushi Tabata.

158
00:11:10.564 --> 00:11:12.564
It looks like a suicide note.

159
00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:15.464
Find something we can use to identify Tabata's handwriting.

160
00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:16.564
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:23.364 --> 00:11:24.864
"Mifuyu"

162
00:11:24.864 --> 00:11:27.964
It seems to be his handwriting.

163
00:11:27.964 --> 00:11:30.964
Which means it's a suicide.

164
00:11:30.964 --> 00:11:36.764
So he regretted murdering Mifuyu and killed himself.

165
00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:39.864
By the way, where is Mifuyu's body?

166
00:11:39.864 --> 00:11:42.064
It doesn't seem to be in this room.

167
00:11:42.064 --> 00:11:43.164
Yeah.

168
00:11:43.164 --> 00:11:45.764
Let's search the other rooms.

169
00:11:45.764 --> 00:11:46.864
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

170
00:11:56.864 --> 00:11:57.964
I found it!

171
00:12:02.464 --> 00:12:04.364
-I'm opening it. -Okay.

172
00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:14.164
It's empty.

173
00:12:14.164 --> 00:12:16.364
Could this be a different suitcase?

174
00:12:17.464 --> 00:12:18.564
What's this?

175
00:12:20.064 --> 00:12:22.864
Based on its length, this is a woman's hair.

176
00:12:22.864 --> 00:12:23.964
Inspector!

177
00:12:23.964 --> 00:12:29.964
Tabata must've dumped Mifuyu's body on the way here.

178
00:12:29.964 --> 00:12:30.964
All right.

179
00:12:30.964 --> 00:12:34.664
We'll head back to identify the hair and search for the body.

180
00:12:34.664 --> 00:12:35.664
Yes, sir!

181
00:12:35.664 --> 00:12:39.164
Mouri, well done. We'll handle the rest.

182
00:12:39.164 --> 00:12:41.664
Got it. Thank you.

183
00:12:41.664 --> 00:12:45.564
Once the police find Mifuyu's body,

184
00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:47.264
this case is closed.

185
00:12:47.264 --> 00:12:48.664
Let's go, kid.

186
00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:53.264
What's wrong? Is there something bothering you?

187
00:12:53.264 --> 00:12:58.364
Why did Tabata bring the suitcase all the way home with him?

188
00:12:58.364 --> 00:13:00.464
Huh? Why?

189
00:13:00.464 --> 00:13:03.264
He should've disposed of it with the body.

190
00:13:03.264 --> 00:13:05.664
Yeah. Now that you mention it, you're right.

191
00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:12.064
And Tabata used his coffee set for guests to drink coffee.

192
00:13:12.064 --> 00:13:16.064
There was a mug he probably used on a regular basis on the counter.

193
00:13:16.064 --> 00:13:18.764
What? It's like how some people groom themselves

194
00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:21.764
before committing suicide.

195
00:13:21.764 --> 00:13:24.964
Or he had a guest.

196
00:13:24.964 --> 00:13:26.164
Hey!

197
00:13:28.764 --> 00:13:30.564
There you go again.

198
00:13:30.564 --> 00:13:32.664
It doesn't look used.

199
00:13:32.664 --> 00:13:35.364
Maybe his guest washed it and put it back.

200
00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:36.564
What?

201
00:13:41.764 --> 00:13:43.264
I knew it.

202
00:13:44.364 --> 00:13:45.864
Knew what?

203
00:13:45.864 --> 00:13:49.264
See? There's lipstick on it.

204
00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:50.264
What?

205
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:52.964
They did wash the cup

206
00:13:52.964 --> 00:13:55.564
to hide the fact that they came here.

207
00:13:55.564 --> 00:13:57.264
To hide it?

208
00:13:57.264 --> 00:13:58.664
You mean it wasn't suicide

209
00:13:58.664 --> 00:14:01.464
because they murdered Tabata instead?

210
00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:03.664
There's no way, right?

211
00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:07.564
There's a suicide note written in Tabata's handwriting.

212
00:14:07.564 --> 00:14:11.064
One that says, "I will go to see Mifuyu".

213
00:14:11.064 --> 00:14:15.464
Does that really mean he meant to commit suicide?

214
00:14:15.464 --> 00:14:17.964
What else could it mean?

215
00:14:17.964 --> 00:14:19.864
Maybe Tabata really did just mean

216
00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:24.164
that he would go to see Mifuyu.

217
00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:26.864
And maybe it was used to look like a suicide note.

218
00:14:26.864 --> 00:14:30.464
Then that means this wasn't a suicide.

219
00:14:30.464 --> 00:14:33.464
Tabata was murdered!

220
00:14:33.464 --> 00:14:35.264
And made to look like he killed Mifuyu

221
00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:38.364
and then killed himself.

222
00:14:38.364 --> 00:14:40.764
Then maybe they killed Mifuyu, too.

223
00:14:40.764 --> 00:14:41.964
Hey, Pops.

224
00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:45.064
When we arrived at Mifuyu's apartment,

225
00:14:45.064 --> 00:14:47.364
it had just stopped raining,

226
00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:49.764
but the perp's footprints were dry.

227
00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.864
What? Is that right?

228
00:14:51.864 --> 00:14:56.464
Which means it had been some time since the footprints got on the floor.

229
00:14:56.464 --> 00:15:00.464
It doesn't make sense that the perp broke the window

230
00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:04.064
and attacked Mifuyu when Ayano arrived.

231
00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:07.864
But Ayano heard the window break

232
00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:11.264
and Mifuyu scream, "Please stop, Tabata."

233
00:15:11.264 --> 00:15:12.464
That's it!

234
00:15:12.464 --> 00:15:14.764
Ayano is lying.

235
00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:16.464
The person who killed Mifuyu is...

236
00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:18.864
But if Ayano did it,

237
00:15:18.864 --> 00:15:23.464
then she wouldn't have taken us to that apartment.

238
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:24.664
That's it!

239
00:15:24.664 --> 00:15:27.564
The perp made footprints on the floor beforehand,

240
00:15:27.564 --> 00:15:31.064
waited for Ayano to arrive to break the window,

241
00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:34.964
and made Mifuyu say Tabata attacked her,

242
00:15:34.964 --> 00:15:37.864
before stabbing her and hiding on the balcony.

243
00:15:37.864 --> 00:15:41.664
No, I don't think there was anyone on the balcony.

244
00:15:41.664 --> 00:15:42.764
Huh?

245
00:15:42.764 --> 00:15:48.064
But Ayano heard the perp make noise on the balcony.

246
00:15:48.064 --> 00:15:52.464
They made a noise so Ayano would think

247
00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:54.864
the perp was on the balcony

248
00:15:54.864 --> 00:15:57.264
and frighten her into leaving,

249
00:15:57.264 --> 00:15:59.264
using a certain tool.

250
00:15:59.264 --> 00:16:01.064
A certain tool?

251
00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:02.764
A toaster.

252
00:16:02.764 --> 00:16:06.264
There was a pop-up toaster in the kitchen.

253
00:16:06.264 --> 00:16:07.964
They put bread in the toaster,

254
00:16:07.964 --> 00:16:10.364
placed a tray on top of it,

255
00:16:10.364 --> 00:16:12.664
and set the timer,

256
00:16:12.664 --> 00:16:14.764
so when Ayano entered,

257
00:16:14.764 --> 00:16:17.364
the toast would pop up,

258
00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:20.364
and the tray would fall and make a sound.

259
00:16:20.364 --> 00:16:24.764
There were crumbs on top of the air conditioner.

260
00:16:24.764 --> 00:16:28.464
Then who killed Mifuyu?

261
00:16:28.464 --> 00:16:30.764
There's only one person

262
00:16:30.764 --> 00:16:32.264
who could've prepared all of that beforehand.

263
00:16:32.264 --> 00:16:34.264
Hey.

264
00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:36.964
You don't mean...

265
00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.364
What's this?

266
00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:41.164
There's something written under today's date.

267
00:16:41.164 --> 00:16:43.364
Paris 293?

268
00:16:43.364 --> 00:16:45.164
293? Wasn't that...

269
00:16:45.164 --> 00:16:48.064
Do these numbers mean anything to you?

270
00:16:48.064 --> 00:16:52.864
Someday I'd like to open a bakery cafe in Paris.

271
00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:55.364
Paris 293...

272
00:16:56.464 --> 00:16:58.364
Darn it! She got us!

273
00:17:30.464 --> 00:17:33.964
Now my new life begins.

274
00:17:33.964 --> 00:17:35.864
I don't think so.

275
00:17:37.164 --> 00:17:39.164
I thought you'd be here.

276
00:17:39.164 --> 00:17:43.764
The 293 on the note thrown away in your apartment

277
00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:46.564
was the flight number of your Paris-bound flight.

278
00:17:47.664 --> 00:17:51.464
I knew you were alive,

279
00:17:51.464 --> 00:17:54.264
Mifuyu Morita.

280
00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:55.464
Who are you talking about?

281
00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:58.764
-You've mistaken me for someone... -Hey, Pops.

282
00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:00.164
I found Mifuyu.

283
00:18:00.164 --> 00:18:02.064
"France Fair" -She's at the France Fair cafe

284
00:18:02.064 --> 00:18:04.164
in the departure lobby.

285
00:18:05.264 --> 00:18:06.564
Yeah, got it.

286
00:18:07.964 --> 00:18:10.764
Anyway, it's time for my flight. I'm leaving.

287
00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:13.164
I don't have time for you.

288
00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:18.564
It hurts...

289
00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:21.664
Isn't that pain from the wound you inflicted on yourself?

290
00:18:23.164 --> 00:18:24.564
So you could put blood on the floor, the knife

291
00:18:24.564 --> 00:18:27.864
and the shoes you used to make the footprints.

292
00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:29.864
I thought it was strange.

293
00:18:29.864 --> 00:18:33.864
There wasn't enough blood for someone stabbed in the chest.

294
00:18:34.964 --> 00:18:40.964
While Ayano was gone, you went to Tabata's house.

295
00:18:40.964 --> 00:18:42.464
You left the bloodstained shoes

296
00:18:42.464 --> 00:18:45.664
and suitcase with the hair inside it.

297
00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:49.864
Then you murdered Tabata made it look like a suicide.

298
00:18:49.864 --> 00:18:52.164
Didn't you?

299
00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.464
What are you talking about?

300
00:18:53.464 --> 00:18:55.664
Who are you?

301
00:18:55.664 --> 00:18:57.264
Conan Edogawa.

302
00:18:57.264 --> 00:18:58.364
I'm a detective.

303
00:19:00.064 --> 00:19:03.364
In any case, I have nothing to do with this.

304
00:19:03.364 --> 00:19:06.364
Hold it right there, Mifuyu Morita.

305
00:19:06.364 --> 00:19:07.964
We're the police.

306
00:19:07.964 --> 00:19:10.164
Mifuyu, you're alive.

307
00:19:12.064 --> 00:19:15.164
After investigating the late Tabata's home,

308
00:19:15.164 --> 00:19:17.464
we discovered his bank book was missing.

309
00:19:17.464 --> 00:19:19.164
We checked with his bank,

310
00:19:19.164 --> 00:19:22.264
who told us 10 million yen had been withdrawn.

311
00:19:22.264 --> 00:19:25.564
Morita, you stole that money, didn't you?

312
00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.064
No.

313
00:19:27.064 --> 00:19:29.764
That 10 million yen is mine.

314
00:19:29.764 --> 00:19:32.464
I was just taking my money back.

315
00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.464
Then why killed Tabata?

316
00:19:35.464 --> 00:19:37.564
It's his fault.

317
00:19:37.564 --> 00:19:41.264
He tried to steal my money.

318
00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:42.764
So I...

319
00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.264
I'll head to Paris first

320
00:19:45.264 --> 00:19:47.564
and find a location for my cafe.

321
00:19:47.564 --> 00:19:48.564
Yeah.

322
00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:50.564
I'll be there soon.

323
00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:52.664
You say that now,

324
00:19:52.664 --> 00:19:56.164
but you actually plan to get with another woman, don't you?

325
00:19:56.164 --> 00:19:58.164
Of course not.

326
00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.764
Then please,

327
00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:04.864
promise me you'll come see me.

328
00:20:04.864 --> 00:20:07.564
Then I won't doubt you anymore.

329
00:20:07.564 --> 00:20:09.164
Fine.

330
00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:11.664
If that'll put your mind at ease.

331
00:20:14.164 --> 00:20:16.964
I was mortified, so I thought I'd trick him

332
00:20:16.964 --> 00:20:20.264
and steal all his money.

333
00:20:20.264 --> 00:20:24.064
He got that money tricking other women, anyway.

334
00:20:24.064 --> 00:20:28.764
Oh, well. I almost had my rich Paris life.

335
00:20:28.764 --> 00:20:31.764
Mifuyu, did you use me?

336
00:20:31.764 --> 00:20:33.864
I thought we were friends.

337
00:20:33.864 --> 00:20:35.064
What?

338
00:20:35.064 --> 00:20:37.964
How long are you going to keep pretending to be the good girl?

339
00:20:37.964 --> 00:20:39.264
Did I use you?

340
00:20:39.264 --> 00:20:41.264
Yeah, I did.

341
00:20:41.264 --> 00:20:44.564
After all, it's your fault I killed him.

342
00:20:44.564 --> 00:20:45.664
What?

343
00:20:48.264 --> 00:20:50.364
I'm not stupid.

344
00:20:50.364 --> 00:20:54.764
I suspected he was trying to deceive me.

345
00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:59.564
But if he'd just stolen my money and disappeared,

346
00:20:59.564 --> 00:21:02.364
I would've remained a victim.

347
00:21:02.364 --> 00:21:04.964
If only you hadn't snitched!

348
00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:06.664
Because you snitched on him,

349
00:21:06.664 --> 00:21:10.064
-I had to get my revenge! -Hey!

350
00:21:10.064 --> 00:21:12.864
Because of you, I killed him!

351
00:21:12.864 --> 00:21:15.764
-Because of you, he died! -Stop!

352
00:21:15.764 --> 00:21:18.464
"You're being tricked, Mifuyu". Yeah, right!

353
00:21:18.464 --> 00:21:22.564
You just wanted to brag that he didn't trick you!

354
00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:23.964
That's enough!

355
00:21:26.064 --> 00:21:28.764
You decided to kill Tabata,

356
00:21:28.764 --> 00:21:33.864
and then actually did it.

357
00:21:33.864 --> 00:21:35.764
Don't blame anyone else!

358
00:23:02.364 --> 00:23:04.564
It's pretty late.

359
00:23:04.564 --> 00:23:05.764
Yeah.

360
00:23:05.764 --> 00:23:08.764
Women are terrifying.

361
00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:11.364
A woman that beautiful can change so suddenly.

362
00:23:13.264 --> 00:23:16.164
Come to think of it, didn't we leave to get lunch?

363
00:23:16.164 --> 00:23:18.664
Let's get some soba in the area.

364
00:23:18.664 --> 00:23:21.064
Mr. Mouri!

365
00:23:21.064 --> 00:23:22.064
Excuse me,

366
00:23:22.064 --> 00:23:24.864
but you're The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

367
00:23:24.864 --> 00:23:27.564
Yes.

368
00:23:27.564 --> 00:23:28.564
-Lucky us! -Lucky us!

369
00:23:28.564 --> 00:23:31.164
We're huge fans!

370
00:23:31.164 --> 00:23:33.664
Will you tell us about your cases?

371
00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:38.464
In that case, why don't we get dinner somewhere?

372
00:23:38.464 --> 00:23:40.364
-I'm so happy! -Are you sure?

373
00:23:40.364 --> 00:23:42.264
It's fine!

374
00:23:42.264 --> 00:23:45.964
We were just talking about getting some French cuisine!

375
00:23:49.664 --> 00:23:52.364
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

376
00:23:54.364 --> 00:23:59.764
"Next Episode"

377
00:23:59.764 --> 00:24:05.064
So, have you figured out who tried to kill me?

378
00:24:07.264 --> 00:24:09.564
Of course I know.

379
00:24:09.564 --> 00:24:12.664
There's no mystery Kogoro Mouri cannot solve.

380
00:24:12.664 --> 00:24:16.664
All truths will be revealed!

381
00:24:19.064 --> 00:24:24.364
Next Conan, "Solving Mysteries in a Locked Room"

382
00:24:24.707 --> 00:24:27.307
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:27.307 --> 00:24:29.307
"Ballpoint pen"

384
00:24:29.307 --> 00:24:30.407
Huh? You're back already?

385
00:24:30.407 --> 00:24:31.407
Women are terrifying.

386
00:24:31.407 --> 00:24:34.107
Pops, you have no eye for women.
