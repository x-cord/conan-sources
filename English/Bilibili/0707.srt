1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,940
This is delicious.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,040
Drinking beer in day time is exceptionally fantastic.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Are you Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,640
You want my autograph? Sure.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,940
No, there's a call for you, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,740
Oh, thank you.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,440
Yes, hello?

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,840
Hey there, famed detective. Long time no see.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,140
Who are you?

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,440
How sad that you should forget me.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,940
It's me. I'm Mr. Reiji Himuro.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,140
Himuro?

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,340
Don't tell me that you're that Himuro.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,340
Hey, you. Just what do you think you're doing?

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,340
It's so nice

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,740
to be with your children, so peaceful.

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,540
What do you want?

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,240
Thanks to you, somebody's going to die.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,840
What?

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,840
Oh, no.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,240
Aim for a 100% solution.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,640
Clear all mysteries and codes.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,540
A trap that was rigged with a weird alibi.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,740
Kogoro Mouri is in dire straits.

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,540
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:17,178
"The Famed Detective is Framed".

29
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,878
Pops, over there!

30
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,078
Darn! Don't you dare move from there, Himuro!

31
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,078
Dad!

32
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,178
Excuse me, miss. Your bill.

33
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:48,078
"Reiji Himuro (40)" -I was looking outside

34
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:50,778
"Previously a bank robber" -when I happened to see you.

35
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:52,978
I felt nostalgic that I decided to call you.

36
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:54,278
Cut out the joke!

37
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:56,278
What was that call a while ago about?

38
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,378
Where and who's going to die?

39
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:01,278
If that's what you're concerned about, it's already too late.

40
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:04,078
What? What do you mean?

41
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,478
Dad, no!

42
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:09,378
-Hey, isn't that Kogoro Mouri? -Why you, what are you up to?

43
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:18,378
Darn! So, this is what he wants.

44
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:23,178
The victim is Mr. Shingo Numao, age 35.

45
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:24,578
He's an auto mechanic,

46
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,278
working at an auto repair factory called Taiyo Motors in 3-Beika-cho.

47
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,078
He died of an impact throughout his entire body

48
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,878
and virtually died on the spot.

49
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:35,178
-He fell from there? -Yes.

50
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,678
How about it, Chiba?

51
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:38,178
No mistake about it.

52
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,578
He fell from here.

53
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:43,178
The railing is corroded and part of it is missing.

54
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:46,478
But, there are no signs of a struggle.

55
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,678
I see.

56
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:50,978
"Morgue"

57
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:53,278
"Shingo Numao (35), Previously a bank robber" -Numao.

58
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,578
Is it you?

59
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,978
Do you know him, Dad?

60
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,378
Yeah.

61
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:03,978
I arrested that guy Himuro after getting info from Numao.

62
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,878
Reiji Himuro.

63
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:10,578
He was a notorious bank robber.

64
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,178
I see. If I remember correctly, Numao was...

65
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,778
Yes.

66
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:17,978
He used to be Himuro's accomplice, rather his henchman.

67
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:20,578
He was virtually a dogsbody.

68
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,878
He listened to my advice telling him

69
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:28,578
to quit being a yes man for such a scum.

70
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:34,478
Numao, I'm sure you can start over.

71
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:35,678
Believe me

72
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,278
and tell me what you know about Himuro.

73
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:40,678
I think that's right.

74
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:45,778
It's a bummer being used by that scum forever, right?

75
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:50,178
It doesn't worth to be made an accomplice of a homicide because of him.

76
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,478
Homicide?

77
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,078
No.

78
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:54,578
I just thought that if I continued doing what I'm doing now,

79
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:57,378
I'd eventually turn out that way.

80
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:02,378
So, where's Himuro now?

81
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:03,978
In the interrogation room.

82
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,678
Officer Sato is hearing him out now.

83
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:12,278
He used to be an easy mark, who fell for anything from before.

84
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:15,578
Therefore, he got away with probation,

85
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:19,778
while I was jailed for ages.

86
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,878
It's good to know that that he's not around anymore.

87
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:23,278
Cut it out!

88
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:25,078
Weren't you the one who did it?

89
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,178
According to Mr. Mouri...

90
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,278
How?

91
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:32,678
So, when did Numao die?

92
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,578
At about 3:40 PM.

93
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:37,278
3:40 PM?

94
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:40,678
If I remember correctly at that time, I was at Hokubu Department Store

95
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:44,678
and grabbed by the collar by a certain famous detective.

96
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:48,778
Then, embarrassed him in front of the public.

97
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,378
Just as would be expected of a famed detective.

98
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:53,178
He's really reliable.

99
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,178
I'm counting on you to testify my alibi.

100
00:06:57,178 --> 00:07:01,178
If so, how'd you know that he was going to die?

101
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:03,378
I guess you can call it telepathy.

102
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,178
Darn!

103
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:07,078
-Wait. -Mr. Mouri!

104
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,878
Himuro! How dare you!

105
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,178
Mr. Mouri!

106
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:12,878
I'll bet you killed him beforehand

107
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:15,178
and set him up to somehow fall to his death. Isn't that right?

108
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:17,478
No, Mr. Mouri!

109
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,078
You... What right do you have to grab me by my collar?

110
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:23,078
What?

111
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:24,678
Mr. Mouri!

112
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,278
Hey, let me go, will you?

113
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,378
Enough, Mr. Mouri.

114
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,378
But Inspector...

115
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:35,278
Well then,

116
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:40,378
since this voluntary interrogation's over without hassle,

117
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,678
I guess I'll leave now.

118
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,978
"A Famed Detective Disgraces Himself"

119
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,078
"Detective Goes On A Rampage In Broad Daylight!"

120
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:04,078
"The Eyes Of A Lunatic"

121
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,278
What's this about the websites flooded with comments?

122
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,478
I don't care about it!

123
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,378
I'm an incompetent, fumbling detective!

124
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:29,378
What do you mean, Inspector?

125
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:33,078
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, Mouri!

126
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,978
On what charges are we supposed to arrest him on?

127
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,678
That's...

128
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:39,178
Futhermore,

129
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:43,478
you publicly assaulted a person who's not even a suspect

130
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:45,578
and tried to charge him.

131
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:46,678
If things came to worse,

132
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:50,078
we have to arrest you, understand?

133
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:53,278
You mean you feel that way too, Inspector?

134
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,278
I don't feel that way.

135
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,978
Still, that's how society sees it.

136
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,378
He provoked you. You fell for it

137
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:02,378
and now you've lost your control.

138
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,278
Take time off for a while.

139
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,478
Dad.

140
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:16,978
I understand how you feel, but you're drinking too much.

141
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:26,078
There. That's the cafe where we were at.

142
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:28,878
It's much too far to find it coincidentally.

143
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,078
No doubt about it.

144
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,278
He was on his guard, watching for Pops from way before that.

145
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,178
Conan?

146
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,278
Where's Mr. Mouri?

147
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,678
He said that he had to go check somewhere else,

148
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:45,578
so he told me to tell you to check on this side.

149
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:46,978
I see.

150
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,978
I'm relieved to hear that.

151
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,978
I was worried because the media was really bashing him.

152
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:54,478
He's fine.

153
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,678
He's all out to clear his name.

154
00:09:57,678 --> 00:10:00,478
By the way, will everything be okay on your side, Officer Takagi?

155
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,778
Cooperating with Pops.

156
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:07,178
Yeah. After all, Mr. Mouri's always helping us out.

157
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:08,878
So, doing this much is nothing.

158
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,478
Around here?

159
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,278
Yes.

160
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,878
A little more before would be better.

161
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:22,078
-Before? -Before, I see.

162
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:25,978
Right there.

163
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,778
Can you show me from a little before that?

164
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,878
Hey, can we look at the floor below here?

165
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:38,978
Yeah.

166
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,078
Around here?

167
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,678
It's Himuro.

168
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,978
-What lies beyond that? -It's the men's restroom.

169
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:56,778
He's coming back.

170
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,678
Hey, what's that?

171
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:01,078
The one to the right edge of the screen.

172
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,178
Oh, that? Probably a microphone.

173
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:07,778
They had a public radio recording there last night.

174
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,078
Over here?

175
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:13,578
I heard they're having a recording today too.

176
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:16,578
Yeah, but it doesn't look as if Himuro came here

177
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:19,678
because he had something to do.

178
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,178
Officer Takagi.

179
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:24,278
There's one more thing he asked me to ask you to check on.

180
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:25,578
One more thing?

181
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:30,478
Thank you for waiting.

182
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,578
I'm officer Eguchi from the Beika police station.

183
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,678
Good work.

184
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,278
And...

185
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,378
Conan?

186
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:41,578
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you again.

187
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:42,778
About what?

188
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,578
Why'd you come here to begin with?

189
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:50,578
The fact is, I got word while I was on patrol.

190
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:53,978
That a suspicious person was inside this building.

191
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,078
This building is under destruction

192
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,578
because there's danger of it coming down.

193
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:00,978
So, I rushed over here and found...

194
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,478
Hey, you! Watch out!

195
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:06,678
Gosh.

196
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:15,578
Who gave out this info?

197
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,278
It seems he didn't say his name.

198
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,678
And when his number was re-dialed, there was no answer.

199
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:23,578
I thought that it may be a prank.

200
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:26,178
The call is recorded, right?

201
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,478
So that maybe a voice check can be carried out?

202
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:31,378
I see! Maybe it was Himuro.

203
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,578
I'll contact the command and control center, as well as the forensics.

204
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,978
I wonder why Mr. Numao came to a place like this.

205
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:43,778
-You didn't see anyone else, did you? -No.

206
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:45,678
Yes, Takagi here.

207
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:49,178
There's something I want you to confirm for me.

208
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,778
Yes, that's right.

209
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,278
What I want you to confirm is

210
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,378
about a call from an informant that came in yesterday at around 13:30.

211
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:00,078
-A phone call! -A phone call?

212
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,078
Yes, I just remember it.

213
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,978
It did seem like he was talking to someone on the cell phone.

214
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,478
Strange.

215
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:11,678
Mr. Numao who fell didn't have a cell phone,

216
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:14,078
and there was none near the corpse either.

217
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,578
Maybe he disposed it before he fell.

218
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:20,678
Maybe he had some incoming call history that he didn't want anybody to see.

219
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:23,778
Okay. Let's expand the area of search and look for it.

220
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:24,778
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,778
It's all rusty.

222
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:45,878
That was close!

223
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,978
This is...

224
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:54,578
I get it.

225
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,078
That's how it is.

226
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,278
I found it! I found it!

227
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,978
I found it on the ground over here!

228
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,954
Even if we were able to get Mr. Numao's fingerprints from this cell phone,

229
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:22,054
being thrown over to such a distance,

230
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,354
it's questionable whether the data is left undamaged.

231
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,354
Right.

232
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,754
Just now Pops called to say

233
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:33,554
to check closer to the part where the railing broke off.

234
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:34,854
Okay!

235
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,854
Wait a second.

236
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:39,754
Himuro, back then...

237
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,254
If so, maybe he put it there.

238
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,354
Conan?

239
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:41,154
Found it!

240
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:46,954
Attention to all customers.

241
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:48,154
We will be having the public radio recording...

242
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:51,054
But the possibility of the incoming and outgoing calls history

243
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:53,454
being damaged are high.

244
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,354
Isn't there any other evidence?

245
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,254
It will be held on the second-floor event square of this store.

246
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,754
I repeat.

247
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:01,454
We will be having the public radio recording of Gogoraji

248
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,154
-that we also had yesterday. -Okay, when I give you the signal,

249
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,854
please applaud!

250
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:08,354
Maybe...

251
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:21,654
Yes, Megure here.

252
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,854
Hello, Inspector. This is Mouri.

253
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:27,554
I have a favor to ask you.

254
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,554
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad. You have a call from Inspector Megure.

255
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,854
Hello.

256
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:36,954
What can I do for you, Inspector?

257
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:40,754
Himuro?

258
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:43,654
Calling me out like this without a warrant.

259
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,854
Are you the one who did this?

260
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:47,954
No. I...

261
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:50,054
What is the meaning of this, Inspector?

262
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:52,254
What are you talking about?

263
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:54,754
You asked me to bring him in

264
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:56,554
because you'd prove the crime he committed.

265
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:00,254
-Mouri? -Dad!

266
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,554
So, this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

267
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:08,354
Let me start from the conclusion.

268
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:11,854
He used the cell phone to manipulate Shingo Numao,

269
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:15,054
and made him fall to his death from the emergency stairs.

270
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:19,054
Can you conclude that it wasn't an accident?

271
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:21,754
Yes, of course.

272
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:23,454
The emergency stairs of this building,

273
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:27,454
partway to the 4th floor has a large hole.

274
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,254
If you try to step over it,

275
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:32,554
your hand would naturally grab the railing on the left side.

276
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:36,954
However, if that railing were to be corroded and frail...

277
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:43,754
Here's a hole in your unfounded accusation.

278
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:46,554
Is it my fault that the railing was rusted?

279
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,454
Right, it's your fault.

280
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:49,654
What?

281
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,254
Officer Chiba, please explain it to him.

282
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,654
Yes, sir.

283
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:57,354
A corrosive agent was painted on the railing.

284
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:58,754
According to forensics,

285
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,554
if left as is for a week,

286
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:03,154
the railing should shatter to pieces.

287
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:07,254
Moreover, you mentally cornered Numao.

288
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,654
Officer Takagi.

289
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,254
Okay.

290
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:13,354
When Mr. Himuro was arrested previously,

291
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:16,654
there was one case that couldn't be proven.

292
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,354
It was the case of two robbers broke into

293
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:21,054
a cooperative bank in Beika 2 chome.

294
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:23,654
One of the security guards was killed.

295
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:24,954
Hey, hey.

296
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:28,754
Stop making it sound like I'm the culprit to everything that happened.

297
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,154
The two robbers who broke in back then

298
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:33,754
were Numao and you, weren't you?

299
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:36,654
You called Numao over to this building

300
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:40,154
and called him to tell that the murder of the security guard was exposed.

301
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:42,454
And what if a police officer came to the scene

302
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,754
and then shouting something out loud?

303
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:47,154
-Hey, you! Watch out! -I'm sure Numao panicked.

304
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:57,154
Numao's cell phone

305
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:59,954
and the cell phone you disposed in the toilet tank at the department store

306
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:01,754
were already retrieved.

307
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:05,154
If we check the incoming and outgoing calls history,

308
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:07,454
we can prove that you committed the crime.

309
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,754
Yes, this is Sato.

310
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:13,754
Yes. Yes, sir.

311
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,854
Is that right?

312
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,454
It didn't work out.

313
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:20,054
The data of both cell phones were damaged,

314
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,354
and it seems they can't confirm the incoming and outgoing calls history.

315
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:23,654
What about the voiceprint of the person

316
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,654
who called to inform that Numao was in the building?

317
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:28,554
It was changed mechanically.

318
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,654
Good work.

319
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,054
Great entertainment indeed.

320
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:39,254
I see. Your story falls right into place,

321
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,154
but with no proof what so ever,

322
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:44,454
you can't indict me, can you?

323
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:45,854
Hey, Inspector.

324
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:46,954
I think you should educate

325
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:51,054
that incompetent, fumbling detective of yours.

326
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,154
See you then.

327
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,154
-Dad. -What now, Mouri?

328
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,154
It's not over yet.

329
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:02,754
We are changing the schedule of today's Gogoraji

330
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:07,454
to the live broadcast of the famed Sleeping Kogoro.

331
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:09,754
He will be presenting his deductions

332
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,354
in order to clear his name.

333
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:14,254
What took you so long?

334
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,754
Let's start then.

335
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,854
At about 3:40 pm yesterday,

336
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:19,854
what were you doing?

337
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,954
I was at the Hokubu Department Store

338
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,554
preparing for the public radio recording.

339
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,054
I see.

340
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,554
Then, will you please let us hear

341
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:32,154
the recording you played for the child I sent over once again?

342
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,354
Yes, sir.

343
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,754
Mr. Takahashi, will you play it for us?

344
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:39,454
Test, test.

345
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:42,354
Mic test. Do you hear me?

346
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,754
-Tanaka, is everything okay? -Yes, sir.

347
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,454
What about the microphone in the rear?

348
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,854
Yes. It's perfect.

349
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,454
We can't hear anything, can we?

350
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:54,554
Well then, please mute the noise from the crowd in the background.

351
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:55,554
Got it.

352
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:57,954
Test, test.

353
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:00,554
Mic test. Do you hear me?

354
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:03,654
The police officer is after you.

355
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:05,154
They are right in front of that building now.

356
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:06,654
Tanaka, is everything okay?

357
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:08,054
Hurry up, Numao.

358
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:09,054
Yes, sir.

359
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:11,054
Hide on the roof!

360
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,554
What about the microphone in the rear?

361
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,954
Next time you're caught, you'll be sent to prison.

362
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,854
No, you'll be sentenced to death.

363
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:20,654
See you, traitor.

364
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:27,354
Darn! How dare you make a joke out of me?

365
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:32,854
You amateur!

366
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:35,754
What the...

367
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,054
Ran?

368
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:39,854
You scum!

369
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:48,454
Afterwards, Himura confessed to the murder he committed this time

370
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,154
and the previous accounts of his crime too.

371
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:54,454
Pops's name was successfully cleared.

372
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,954
"Mouri Detective Agency"

373
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:24,654
Come on, Dad.

374
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,054
I was about to throw a celebratory party and yet,

375
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:32,154
you've got the nerve to toast all by yourself.

376
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:33,754
Well, who cares?

377
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:35,554
Let's do it, just two of us, then?

378
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:36,754
Yes.

379
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:40,554
-To the famed detective. -To the famed detective.

380
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,554
To the famed detective.

381
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:48,854
-Cheers. -Cheers.

382
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,554
Cheers!

383
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:55,154
"Next Episode" -What a dangerous thing to do in a place like that.

384
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,254
He's been pushed off!

385
00:23:57,254 --> 00:23:59,454
He didn't commit suicide.

386
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,754
It's not an accident either.

387
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:04,054
Somebody pushed him off the roof.

388
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,654
Wait.

389
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,754
We saw the man being pushed off.

390
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:09,754
That's right.

391
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:11,654
At 2:00 pm sharp.

392
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:12,754
Yeah.

393
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:16,654
In other words, it was a long fall that took 10 minutes to hit the ground.

394
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:18,154
Next Conan,

395
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:20,354
"The Man Who Fell Slowly".

396
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:40,254
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:42,054
"Veranda".

398
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,654
There's no case that I cannot solve!

399
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:44,954
It's already midnight.

400
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:46,954
Is this supposed to be a case too?
