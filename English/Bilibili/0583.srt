1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,240
Good morning.

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,940
Good morning.

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,340
How come you look so untidy?

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,040
"Smoking Room"

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,540
If you're a police detective,

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,040
you should dress and groom yourself like one.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,940
I can't help it, can I?

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,940
I was staking out all night till just a while ago.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,940
Geez.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,440
The least you can do is fix your necktie right.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,940
It's okay because I finished reporting

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,240
and all I have to do today is go home and sleep already.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,740
Hey, stop moving.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,940
Okay.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,840
It... it's okay already.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,740
I'll do the rest myself.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Thank you so much.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,040
I'll go on home then.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,540
Gosh.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,640
Wait up, Officer Takagi.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,140
Wait for me.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,540
-No... -Officer Takagi sure is outright open nowadays.

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,340
It seems the number of times they have meals together

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,540
is also increasing day by day.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,040
I've also heard unverified information

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,940
that they've kissed too.

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,040
-What? -What?

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,340
Without even consulting me?

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,340
Well...

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,540
It's like I said merely unverified information.

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,040
Then, go confirm it right away.

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,540
-You're a detective, aren't you? -Hey.

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,140
-How about it, Shiratori? -What?

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,640
What's going on between Takagi and Sato.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,240
You're in charge of completely guarding Miwako Sato, aren't you?

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,640
If it's those two,

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,940
I think it's turning out the way it should.

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,540
It seems they both have feelings for each other too.

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,040
Besides, I gave away being in charge to somebody else.

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,540
So, if you will excuse me...

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,440
Hey, Shiratori!

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,640
What's come over him?

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,240
According to some tips I got,

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
it seems Mr. Shiratori has another girlfriend.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,840
-What? -What?

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,940
Something about she being a split double of Ms. Sato.

47
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,040
Who and where the hell is she?

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,440
Brooding over passing seasons

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Ms. Kobayashi encounters a case.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,540
Inspector Shiratori is her bodyguard?

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

55
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:19,837
"Ms. Kobayashi's Love Affair"

56
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:23,537
Yes. I got it.

57
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:26,337
You don't want me walking around alone at night, right?

58
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:28,137
No. If possible,

59
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:31,637
I'd like you not to go out after 9 pm.

60
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:36,837
Because there are a lot of muggings in the area that you live now.

61
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,937
I saw it on the news this morning.

62
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,137
The culprit seems to be a woman.

63
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,137
Yes.

64
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,337
But...

65
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:45,937
Why?

66
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:49,037
Why do you give me a call all the time?

67
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:52,337
Because I'm worried.

68
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,937
Does it bother you?

69
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,937
No. It's the other way around,

70
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:57,337
you're helping me a lot.

71
00:04:57,337 --> 00:04:59,337
I'm glad.

72
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:02,437
Please be very careful then.

73
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:05,537
Yes. Thank you so much for going out of your way to call me.

74
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,637
Teacher.

75
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,637
I've been trying to tell you from a while ago

76
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,537
that we finished cleaning the rabbit cage already.

77
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:20,037
You children were monitors for cleaning the rabbit cage

78
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:22,337
during summer vacation.

79
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:23,637
Good work.

80
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:26,837
Was the call just now from Inspector Shiratori?

81
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,637
Yes, but how did you know?

82
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:33,837
It's easy to tell.

83
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:36,837
Your face is red, teacher.

84
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,037
No... no way. I'm not blushed.

85
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:41,037
And?

86
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:45,537
Did he tell you already that he likes you?

87
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:49,537
What? Why?

88
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:51,237
I guess not.

89
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:53,937
Doesn't Inspector Shiratori look familiar?

90
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,037
Familiar?

91
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:58,737
Like, have you seen him when you were a child?

92
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,537
Come to think of it...

93
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:01,937
When I first saw him,

94
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:05,537
it felt like it wasn't the first time.

95
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,337
It was like a strange drawer

96
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:10,037
that was deep inside my heart opened.

97
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,937
Then, the clue is bookstore.

98
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,037
Bookstore?

99
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,237
Inspector Shiratori told us to not say anything

100
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:18,837
about the incident at the bookstore

101
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,137
when he saved Ms. Kobayashi from some shoplifters

102
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:25,237
because he wants to tell her himself, didn't he?

103
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:26,737
Right.

104
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:29,137
Well, I'm sure he's waiting for the right timing to tell her,

105
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:32,137
so that he can touch her heart.

106
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,337
How frustrating, don't you think?

107
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:36,237
Don't tell me that...

108
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:37,337
The book titled

109
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:40,037
"The 30 Mistakes of the Mystery Man with 30 Faces"

110
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:41,837
is going on the market today, isn't it?

111
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,237
Yes.

112
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,237
Good.

113
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,237
I forgot to reserve it so I've got to go buy it today.

114
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:49,837
Then, you'd better go get it quickly.

115
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,937
The bookstore that you always go to

116
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:55,637
is going to be closing early today because of fireworks.

117
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,437
Really? Then, I'd better hurry.

118
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:01,737
Oh, right. Talking of fireworks, are you all going too?

119
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:02,737
Yes.

120
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:06,237
We're going to gather at 6 pm at Conan's place and go.

121
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,637
How unusual.

122
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,037
I thought you always got together at Dr. Agasa's place

123
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,737
and then go together?

124
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:17,137
Doctor has to help his friend move, so he can't go.

125
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,537
Then, is Detective Mouri going as chaperon?

126
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:21,937
Pops said that he's going to watch fireworks

127
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:23,437
with his neighbors and drink.

128
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,937
Ran is at summer training with her Karate Club.

129
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:29,037
We're going by ourselves. Does it bother you?

130
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,337
Of course, it bothers me.

131
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,237
"Mouri Detective Agency" -She's late!

132
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:40,237
We'd better hurry or it'll start.

133
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,837
Well, I'm sure she'll come soon.

134
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,637
Teacher! Ms. Kobayashi!

135
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:48,937
Hurry, hurry!

136
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:50,737
You're late.

137
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,037
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:54,137
I had trouble buying the book.

139
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,237
The first one already went up.

140
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,237
Really, if we went by ourselves,

141
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:04,637
we would've made it in time.

142
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:08,037
No way. Children shouldn't walk around at night.

143
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:11,037
There's a mugger attacking people in this area recently,

144
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:13,037
so you've got to be careful.

145
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:17,037
And, did Inspector Shiratori tell you that?

146
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,737
Yes.

147
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,837
Inspector Shiratori is head over heels over her.

148
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:25,337
Well, I guess he couldn't leave me alone

149
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,837
because I'm not that reliable.

150
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,637
But...

151
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:33,537
Not being able to leave you alone is the same as, "like."

152
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,437
Really?

153
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:37,737
You think so?

154
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,137
Yes. I'm positive.

155
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:45,637
But...

156
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:49,637
Even so, I wonder how he would do as a boyfriend?

157
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,537
After all, he's a police detective,

158
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,037
so if he's going after a dangerous culprit,

159
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,637
I'd have to worry.

160
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:59,937
But being able to listen to stories of different cases, may be fun.

161
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:02,737
Because like you know, I just love mysteries.

162
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:03,737
Right?

163
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,437
Where'd they all go?

164
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:11,837
"Cotton Candy"

165
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,737
"Fried Noodles"

166
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:18,837
There are so many open air stalls.

167
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:20,637
I want to eat cotton candy.

168
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:23,037
They have fish scooping too.

169
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,537
Ms. Kobayashi's not around, is she?

170
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:28,737
I did tell her that we were going to take the short cut.

171
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,637
Hey.

172
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,337
Where are all of you?

173
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,537
Conan?

174
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,837
They could never be in a place like this.

175
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,337
Where could they be?

176
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,537
Right.

177
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:49,337
I guess I'll mail Inspector Shiratori.

178
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,037
"Inspector. There's trouble."

179
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:54,537
"5 children disappeared in a puff of smoke."

180
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,437
-Pretty good. -Never mind, just give me that!

181
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:58,637
I'm going to kill you.

182
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,337
Somebody's having an argument with somebody.

183
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:07,837
Don't tell me that...

184
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,037
it's the mugger?

185
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,337
I'm calling the inspector.

186
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:15,837
But, if I'm wrong, I'd be troubling him.

187
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,837
Only if Conan and the others were here...

188
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,237
Right.

189
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,537
It could be that they've gotten mixed up in it too.

190
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,437
I've got to confirm either way.

191
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:45,137
What?

192
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:49,937
What's with that person?

193
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:55,537
No.

194
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,737
Ms. Kobayashi sure is late.

195
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,837
Geez.

196
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,137
Hey, you guys.

197
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:10,437
I'm going to go get Ms. Kobayashi

198
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,637
so stay around here, okay?

199
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,437
-Okay. -Okay...

200
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:16,837
Hey.

201
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,937
Hello.

202
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:22,137
Are you all right?

203
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:35,637
Ms. Kobayashi?

204
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:39,037
Oh, no.

205
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,237
Why...

206
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:48,937
Ms. Kobayashi?

207
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:50,037
Don't come.

208
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:51,937
If you come now, that person will attack...

209
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:54,937
He's gone.

210
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,037
Ms. Kobayashi.

211
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:00,437
There was somebody there till a while ago, right?

212
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,937
The person who killed this man.

213
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:22,543
Come on, Ms. Kobayashi.

214
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,643
Don't tense up like that.

215
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,343
But... this is the first time I ever came here.

216
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:33,143
You were called to come here because you witnessed a murder.

217
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:36,543
It's not that you're going to be interrogated for committing a crime

218
00:12:36,543 --> 00:12:38,343
so I don't see why you're not more relaxed.

219
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,643
I guess so.

220
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,343
I've come here so many times,

221
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,643
that I've eaten everything on the restaurant menu they have here.

222
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,643
That's eating too much.

223
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,643
Miwako.

224
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:51,843
Hi.

225
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:54,043
Have you come here for interrogation with the brats?

226
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:57,843
What's with that outfit of yours?

227
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,143
You're even wearing glasses and all.

228
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:02,043
Are you changing your image?

229
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:03,743
No.

230
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:04,843
"No."

231
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,943
Hey, are you asleep yet or what?

232
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,843
Shape up.

233
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,543
Did you just say, "kyah?"

234
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,543
Just what do you think you're doing?

235
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,243
What am I doing?

236
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,243
Miwako, are you sure you don't have a fever or something.

237
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:21,243
No, Yumi.

238
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,743
She is...

239
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:23,743
Ms. Sato.

240
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:26,943
The children have come.

241
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:31,643
Wasn't the school teacher supposed to come too?

242
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,743
So, like I said, she is...

243
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:37,743
The homeroom teacher of Teitan Elementary, First grade, Class B,

244
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:41,343
and also an important witness to the murder that occurred,

245
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:43,543
Ms. Sumiko Kobayashi.

246
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,443
Please don't mistake her for someone else.

247
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:51,243
Okay, please give us the details in that room over there.

248
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:52,243
Yes.

249
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,443
You've got be kidding.

250
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:02,743
Excuse me, is there somebody that looks like me?

251
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:06,443
Yes. Although I don't think that you look that much alike.

252
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:12,043
Well... I think, maybe a little bit?

253
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:15,543
Are we by chance going to the interrogation room?

254
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,443
No, just to a plain conference room.

255
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,643
I see.

256
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,443
You look a bit disappointed.

257
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,543
Oh, no...

258
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:25,243
I was just a bit interested.

259
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:30,543
Is the girl that Shiratori is head over heels with?

260
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:33,543
I've kept hearing that they resembled each other but...

261
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:35,943
I didn't think that she looked that much like Ms. Sato.

262
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,743
I was surprised too

263
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,343
when I first met her.

264
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,643
Right, right.

265
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,243
Yes. But, well...

266
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:45,043
the way she talks and her character too

267
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,743
are completely opposite so... Ouch.

268
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:50,843
Who's the complete opposite of me?

269
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,843
Oh, no...

270
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:53,043
Well, well,

271
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:56,343
he's just saying that you're more police detective like and manly.

272
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:58,143
What? What's that supposed to mean?

273
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:01,643
Well, never mind.

274
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:04,143
The three suspects for the murder case were brought here,

275
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:06,043
so let's start interrogation.

276
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:07,043
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,443
As for those two,

278
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,343
since Mr. Shiratori, who was their setback pulling out of the picture,

279
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:16,943
they're headed straight toward reaching their goal.

280
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:19,343
Well, as for me,

281
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:23,343
it's a bit boring that I don't get to get Shiratori all worked up

282
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:25,243
and tease him anymore.

283
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:27,743
"Conference Room"

284
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,343
I see.

285
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,443
So, if I organize what you just told me,

286
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:34,243
you were with the children on your way to watch fireworks

287
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:35,643
and lost them partway.

288
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,443
So you were looking for them.

289
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:41,743
Then you heard two people arguing with each other.

290
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:45,743
And then you went into the back alley to check things out

291
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:48,843
and saw the killer run off.

292
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:54,243
In addition, when you screamed at finding the body of the victim,

293
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:58,043
Conan came running to the scene?

294
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,643
Yes, sir.

295
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:02,243
I'd like to just confirm with you once again,

296
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:04,943
but the corpse that you found was...

297
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,743
Mr. Akira Sumida, is that correct?

298
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:13,543
Yes. I think so.

299
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:14,643
And do you remember

300
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:20,543
what Mr. Sumida was arguing about with the killer?

301
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:23,443
Well... I could hear them,

302
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,243
but their conversation was erased by the sound of the fireworks,

303
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:26,443
so I can't say...

304
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,943
But, I remember clearly that the killer woman

305
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,743
was shouting at the top of her lungs

306
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,243
because she did so when no fireworks were shot up.

307
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,243
She said, "Never mind, just give me that. I'll kill you."

308
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:39,443
I see.

309
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:43,243
That's why I thought that she was the mugger

310
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,443
that frequently appeared in the area.

311
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:49,643
No, we arrested the mugger at sunset the same day.

312
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:53,143
But, what makes you think that the killer is a woman?

313
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,343
Is it because you heard her shout?

314
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:58,543
The silhouette of the killer that ran off.

315
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,943
She had quite a breast.

316
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:03,943
Besides, I think she had her long hair tied in the back

317
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,643
and was wearing a cap.

318
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,243
I'm pretty sure.

319
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,443
You didn't get to see the killer's face?

320
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:13,543
No, sir. Because it was dark.

321
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:19,143
But, the killer may have remembered your face, right?

322
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:20,743
Why do you think so?

323
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:23,643
Because I'm not the only one who went running over

324
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,543
after hearing Ms. Kobayashi screamed.

325
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:27,743
What did you say?

326
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:29,043
Then, don't tell me that...

327
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,743
Isn't that right, Ms. Kobayashi?

328
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:35,243
Yes. The killer seems to have been watching me

329
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:37,243
from some distance away.

330
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:40,443
The killer disappeared when Conan came, though.

331
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:42,043
That's dangerous.

332
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,243
There's no guarantee that the killer won't come back

333
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,043
and attack you to shut you up.

334
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:46,043
What?

335
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:48,043
No need to worry.

336
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:49,643
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

337
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:51,343
will spend the night at Ms. Kobayashi's place.

338
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:54,443
We won't let the killer lay a finger on you.

339
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:56,843
All of you.

340
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,343
No. No need for that.

341
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:05,943
Because I, Ninzaburo Shiratori will protect you

342
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:08,543
over my dead body.

343
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,543
Thank you.

344
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:18,243
I don't mean to bring you down

345
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:21,243
but don't you have to ask us any questions,

346
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:23,743
although we got to the scene right after Conan did?

347
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:27,043
Yes. Okay, well let me ask you

348
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:30,743
if you didn't see any figure run off.

349
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,443
We didn't.

350
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:35,543
You sound like you're just asking out of routine.

351
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:39,243
Oh, no. Didn't Mr. Agasa witness anything?

352
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,343
He was with you, wasn't he?

353
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,543
Dr. Agasa couldn't come

354
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,443
because he had to help his friend move.

355
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,843
Move?

356
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:49,143
Come to think of it, before the two started arguing,

357
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:51,143
I saw what looked to be the truck of movers,

358
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,443
go off from near the alley.

359
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,343
What? Really?

360
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,743
Yes. I couldn't tell the model of the car

361
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:00,243
because it was blocked off by the wall.

362
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:03,543
But, there was a large number 09 written on the truck.

363
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,443
How do you know they are movers

364
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:08,343
if numbers are written on the truck?

365
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:11,843
The only cars with company telephone numbers printed on them

366
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:14,243
are those of the movers or couriers.

367
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:18,743
If that truck was parked there for a while,

368
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:22,643
someone may have seen the two arguing.

369
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:24,343
Let's have that checked out right away.

370
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:30,243
Then could we sort on home already?

371
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:33,343
Yes, you children may leave.

372
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:37,343
But, Ms. Kobayashi, will you bear with me a while longer?

373
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,443
Just now

374
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,543
we have three suspects that have been brought here

375
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:44,343
who have grudges against the victim and lack of alibi.

376
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:46,643
And, if you remember the killer's voice,

377
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,643
I'd like you to confirm it.

378
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,743
Yes, sir.

379
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:54,543
But, before that...

380
00:19:55,543 --> 00:19:57,943
What is it?

381
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,943
If it's the restroom, would you like me to go with you?

382
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:01,443
I know where it is.

383
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:04,243
Really?

384
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:07,643
I'm going along too then.

385
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,743
Okay, I'll be right back then.

386
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:15,143
Take your time.

387
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:25,943
Telling a lady to take her time in the restroom is rude.

388
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:29,243
It's as if you're saying that teacher's going to...

389
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:33,243
No way. I didn't mean to insinuate anything.

390
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:39,743
And, what did this woman victim used to do?

391
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,443
She owned a pawn shop.

392
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,843
Hey, please wait a minute.

393
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,043
She's a woman?

394
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,043
Yes.

395
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,843
This shirt is worn right side in front,

396
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:52,243
so it's ladies' wear.

397
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:56,243
The name Akira can be used for a woman or a man too.

398
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,843
I see.

399
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:01,143
Well, it seems that she used to get angry frequently

400
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,343
because people mistook her for being a man.

401
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:06,543
On the other hand, there seems to have been a lot of people

402
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,443
who were angry at her evil ways of doing business.

403
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:10,843
Sorry to keep you waiting.

404
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:15,143
The children aren't back yet?

405
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:21,043
The restrooms in the police station

406
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,243
are like any other restrooms.

407
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:24,943
Most naturally.

408
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,443
What am I talking about?

409
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,143
Why shouldn't I meet her?

410
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:37,243
Well...

411
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:39,043
That's because there are many things involved.

412
00:21:39,043 --> 00:21:41,343
A lot of things involved, is not an answer, is it?

413
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,343
But...

414
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,443
She really is here.

415
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:46,243
The one who looks just like me.

416
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:48,043
If I remember correctly, her name is...

417
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:50,743
Ms. Miwako Sato.

418
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,243
How envious...

419
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:55,943
I wanted to be a woman detective too.

420
00:21:55,943 --> 00:22:00,243
Really, that Takagi is making lovey dovey again

421
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:02,843
with our Ms. Miwako.

422
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:07,943
I think he's getting carried away

423
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:10,143
because Shiratori backed off.

424
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,243
Yes.

425
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:17,543
After all, he was the top in charge of protecting Miwako Sato.

426
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:21,043
Shiratori, really made out, didn't he?

427
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:24,843
Yes. I didn't think she would look that much like Sato.

428
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,743
I wonder if there's another one somewhere?

429
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:30,043
That teacher's the last.

430
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:31,443
Yes, right?

431
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,943
Ms. Kobayashi. Thank you for waiting.

432
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,143
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

433
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,443
Ms. Kobayashi?

434
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:09,043
The suspect is...

435
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:10,943
a woman who used to be the leader of a motorbike gang.

436
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:12,643
The woman owner of a Japanese cuisine shop.

437
00:24:12,643 --> 00:24:14,943
And a former hero of high school baseball.

438
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:18,443
It seems that she doesn't like me anymore.

439
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:22,543
That maybe she was just a substitute for Officer Sato.

440
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:25,143
Are you accusing me of lying?

441
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:27,343
I'm lying.

442
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:31,143
I really came to see you.

443
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,743
Next Conan,

444
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:36,267
"Inspector Shiratori's Heartbreak"

445
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,929
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,329
"Shouting".

447
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,129
I'm going to be appearing in the program

448
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,529
"The Best Class in the World".

449
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:00,729
So, watch it, okay?
