1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,540
-Good morning. -Good morning.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,040
-Good morning. -Good morning.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,840
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,340
Good morning, Conan and Haibara...

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,040
Good... good morning.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,140
You two were at the library where Thief Kid showed up, weren't you?

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,740
And Dr. Agasa!

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,740
Who was Thief Kid disguised as?

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,740
Conan, did you beat Thief Kid?

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,440
Tell us!

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,240
What?

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,440
Thief Kid disguised himself as Dr. Agasa?

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
-Yeah. -And you couldn't tell immediately?

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,140
He was bending his knees to make himself Doc's height.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,840
Impressive as always.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,840
The actual Doc was knocked out with a stun gun

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,140
and stuffed into a bathroom stall.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,840
He sounded and acted exactly like the Doc.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Lucky.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,540
Just once I'd like Thief Kid to disguise himself as me.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,540
Me, too.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,040
He already did.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,040
Okay, everyone! Take your seats.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,440
Hey, Conan. Who's that?

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
I don't know.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,240
Who's that?

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,940
Today, I have a new teacher to introduce.

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,240
"Ms. Rumi Wakasa"

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,240
This is Ms. Wakasa.

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,640
She'll be my assistant homeroom teacher starting today.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Go ahead, Wakasa.

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,740
I'm Rumi Wakasa.

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm ten years older than Ms. Kobayashi, but...

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Nice...

35
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,040
Nice to meet you!

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Are you all right, Ms. Wakasa?

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
You don't usually get assistants this late in the year.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,840
Maybe it's because this class

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,440
has so many transfer students like you and me.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,040
I see.

41
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,140
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

43
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,040
Ms. Wakasa seems clumsy.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
What kind of influence will she have?

45
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,340
His name is Detective Conan.

48
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:38,898
"The New Teacher's Skeleton Case (Part 1)"

49
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,998
Huh? Lime?

50
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,898
What do you need that for?

51
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:49,398
We're playing dodge ball in the yard for fifth period PE.

52
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:54,898
So I thought I'd draw some lines during lunch.

53
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:59,198
But the line marker was nearly out of lime.

54
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,698
There's hardly any in reserve in the storehouse either.

55
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,298
Why not check out the old storage shed?

56
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:08,298
There might be some extra in there.

57
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:12,698
You mean that rundown storage shed that seems haunted?

58
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,298
I heard a teacher once got locked inside

59
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:18,198
and starved to death in there.

60
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,798
Yeah.

61
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:21,698
Help me!

62
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,198
I'm hungry!

63
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,798
Feed me eel!

64
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,798
Yeah, right. What ghost would ask for eel?

65
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:32,398
What? You don't know where it is?

66
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,898
I do, but...

67
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:36,298
But?

68
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:40,298
Well...

69
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:45,498
Do you want us to come with you because you're scared?

70
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:46,598
What?

71
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:48,698
Well, yes.

72
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:57,498
Sorry for making you help me during your lunch break.

73
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:58,798
Not at all.

74
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:01,598
We should help each other out.

75
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:02,998
Thank you.

76
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,098
It really is in shambles!

77
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:10,998
There isn't even a lock on the door.

78
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:13,898
It didn't have one ten years ago either.

79
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,298
What? How do you know that?

80
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:19,098
Well... Ran told me.

81
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,198
Whatever. They should just tear it down.

82
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:29,798
Oh, the principal mentioned that they couldn't

83
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:32,398
because of feng shui or something on the day of the graduation...

84
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,898
At his entrance ceremony address!

85
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:38,798
What? Did he say that?

86
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,298
Conan, you weren't here for the entrance ceremony.

87
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,298
What?

88
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:47,298
Didn't you transfer partway through the year?

89
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:49,698
Is that right?

90
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:51,098
What school are you talking about?

91
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:52,698
-Are you okay? -You're acting weird.

92
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:53,698
This one?

93
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:57,698
In any case, let's get inside and look for the lime.

94
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:03,298
Don't touch that.

95
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,998
Hey, what are you doing, Conan?

96
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,198
Does it not open?

97
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,598
Sorry. I'm opening it now.

98
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:22,098
It's pitch black.

99
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:29,898
It's no use. The light bulb is dead.

100
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:33,598
I'll go and get a flashlight.

101
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,398
-That's quite all right. -What?

102
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:38,698
We have these.

103
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:42,598
Oh, my. Those are awfully convenient.

104
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:44,998
Dr. Agasa made them for us.

105
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,398
We have the youth detective badges that serve as transceivers, too.

106
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:51,998
Really? What an amazing Doc.

107
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:56,598
It's time for the Youth Detective Squad to search for lime!

108
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:58,098
Yeah...

109
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,798
I found a schedule.

110
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,998
It looks pretty old.

111
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,198
The paper is really worn.

112
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,798
There are lots of blank spaces.

113
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:34,998
Maybe they didn't finish filling in it.

114
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,798
A trapdoor leading down?

115
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,498
Some of the rust was just recently worn off.

116
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,898
Did someone open it recently?

117
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:51,798
Hey, Conan. Did you find something?

118
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,498
Is it an entrance to a basement?

119
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:56,998
Maybe that's where...

120
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,298
They got trapped...

121
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:01,398
And the dead teacher's...

122
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,798
Skeleton.

123
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:06,098
We're joking.

124
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:08,498
Ms. Wakasa, you're such a scaredy cat.

125
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,298
I'm opening it.

126
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:11,698
Okay.

127
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,198
There really was a skeleton.

128
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,998
Genta, hold the door!

129
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,598
Got it.

130
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:31,798
Ms. Wakasa, call the police!

131
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:33,098
Right!

132
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,398
Calm down.

133
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:37,798
Right.

134
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:39,098
Unbelievable.

135
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:42,398
Anyway, how does it look, Conan?

136
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,698
Looks like they died a long time ago.

137
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:49,198
Based on the condition of the bones and the surroundings,

138
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:50,398
it's probably been five...

139
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:52,898
No, ten years.

140
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:58,398
There's something in its right hand.

141
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,598
A string?

142
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:03,898
No. A sports day headband?

143
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:06,798
What?

144
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,698
Conan, is something wrong?

145
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,198
Conan?

146
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:14,698
Are you okay?

147
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,998
Come back up.

148
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:20,398
These characters look familiar.

149
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:26,998
I think...

150
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,598
It was...

151
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:38,798
Shinichi!

152
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:42,798
I found a magic string.

153
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,398
A magic string?

154
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,798
It was tied to the old storage shed behind the school.

155
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,998
There's no such thing.

156
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:54,598
But it had lots of characters I've never seen before written on it.

157
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:03,098
See? You don't recognize them, do you?

158
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:04,398
Yeah.

159
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,198
It's probably Chinese.

160
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,898
Let's untie it and show it to the teachers.

161
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:10,998
Okay.

162
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:13,798
Don't.

163
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:18,598
Don't touch that.

164
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:22,898
That's the magic sealing string trapping

165
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:28,298
a terrible monster inside the storage shed.

166
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:38,098
A sealing string?

167
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:09,665
Looks like the body's about ten years old.

168
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:13,365
They didn't have any identification on them,

169
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,365
but they were probably a thief.

170
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:20,865
There was a large crack on the back of the skull,

171
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:25,365
and it looks like they were carrying a large bag of lime.

172
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:28,965
They probably lost their footing

173
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,265
while trying to steal the bag of lime,

174
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:34,965
and died when they struck the back of their head

175
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,365
on the vaulting box at the bottom of the steps.

176
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:40,465
There are no signs of foul play,

177
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:44,565
so unfortunately, we'll be leaving now.

178
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,865
Okay.

179
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,265
Well, I should get going.

180
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,865
Sure. Thank you for coming.

181
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:59,265
Gosh.

182
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,065
So it's not a case.

183
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:02,965
Genta.

184
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:06,665
It's been ten years

185
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,965
since the police last came here.

186
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:10,565
Principal.

187
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,065
What happened ten years ago?

188
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:16,065
Four thieves broke into the home

189
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,065
of a wealthy man who lived in the area.

190
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:24,365
They murdered the man and fled with 200 million yen

191
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:28,265
worth of gold ingots they found in the house.

192
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,865
That same night, someone saw

193
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:36,765
several suspicious figures enter Teitan Elementary School.

194
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:40,065
So the police came to investigate.

195
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:41,465
Really?

196
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:44,565
Were the thieves arrested?

197
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,165
No, not that I've heard.

198
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:51,465
No evil deed goes unpunished.

199
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,165
They're probably living in fear,

200
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:59,865
or have died somewhere.

201
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:12,565
Anyway, I'm surprised someone died in that old storage shed.

202
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:13,665
Yeah.

203
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:16,465
I'm not going near there anymore.

204
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:17,565
Yeah.

205
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,865
It's unfortunate the police took the code string with them.

206
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,965
What was written on it?

207
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:26,465
Maybe it was a curse.

208
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,265
It's called a scytale cipher.

209
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:32,365
What? Su... Sa...

210
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:34,065
Barbecue sauce?

211
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:39,165
It was a cipher used 2500 years ago by the Spartans.

212
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:41,365
2500 years ago...

213
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:43,665
By the Spartans...

214
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,565
Barbecue sauce?

215
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,665
Scytale cipher!

216
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:53,065
First, you make a long band,

217
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:56,065
wrap it around a rod, and write something on it.

218
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,365
For example...

219
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:10,865
"Ayumi is a cheerful and kind girl."

220
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:13,365
See? Like this.

221
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,765
But if you take band off the rod,

222
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:21,665
you can't read what was written on it anymore.

223
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:25,665
Hadeinkshikoyansano...

224
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:27,865
You're right.

225
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,865
It's a code.

226
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:33,565
But if you wrap it around the same rod,

227
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,965
you can read it again.

228
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:39,965
In other words, as long as you have rods of the same size,

229
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:42,365
you can exchange coded messages.

230
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:44,965
I wish we could wrap the code written

231
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,965
on that string around a rod and read it.

232
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,965
Why'd you have to hand it over to the police?

233
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,765
Don't worry.

234
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:53,465
Haibara's printing the photo I took with my phone

235
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,765
in the faculty office right now.

236
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,265
Hey, Haibara.

237
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:59,465
Were you able to print it?

238
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:00,965
Yes.

239
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:03,765
They let me print it

240
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,965
when I said we were using it for a Chinese character quiz.

241
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,365
Here.

242
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,665
Thanks.

243
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,765
Since this code is probably meant to be read

244
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:15,665
by wrapping it around the handles of the storage shed...

245
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:18,665
We should be able to read it

246
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:22,065
if we wrap it around a pen of about this thickness.

247
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,565
What's it say?

248
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:29,065
The second character from the left is the "e" in Edogawa.

249
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,865
But I've never seen the other characters before.

250
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,365
That's odd. Am I using the wrong size rod?

251
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,265
It's no use.

252
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,665
Even if I change the thickness of the pen,

253
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,665
I still can't read it.

254
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,965
What is this code?

255
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,865
Excuse me.

256
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:52,665
Are we really meant to wrap that code around a rod?

257
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:56,465
We couldn't understand the code Conan made for us earlier

258
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:59,965
without wrapping it around a rod,

259
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,465
but we could read each individual character

260
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:05,065
even when it was unwrapped.

261
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,865
Come to think of it, yeah.

262
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:08,765
It was all in hiragana.

263
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:12,265
But the code the skeleton in the storage house had

264
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,765
was full of unrecognizable characters even when unwrapped.

265
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:19,565
Yeah. Those are left and right radicals.

266
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:21,365
-Radicals? -Left...

267
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:22,765
And right radicals?

268
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,365
You know those characters

269
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:28,965
that are made up of two characters put together?

270
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,965
Those are called left and right radicals.

271
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,365
"Genta Kojima" -For example,

272
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:37,465
the "shima" in Kojima's name

273
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:41,165
is made up of the "mountain" and "bird" radicals.

274
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:45,165
And Conan thought the characters written on the code

275
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,565
were radicals and that they'd match up and be legible

276
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:51,765
if he wrapped it around a rod, right?

277
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:53,065
Yeah.

278
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,665
The right side of the code has lots of characters

279
00:17:55,665 --> 00:18:00,565
like "fire" and "metal", which are common left radicals.

280
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:03,365
I thought wrapping it around a rod

281
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,765
would swap the left and right sides

282
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:09,165
so they'd turn into legible characters.

283
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,565
But the only thing we can read is the second character.

284
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:15,265
The "e" in Edogawa.

285
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:21,665
What are those dots and circles at the end of the sentences?

286
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:26,065
Probably standard punctuation.

287
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:30,865
So the three sentences could be...

288
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:34,865
"Genta, had eel again last night."

289
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,165
"He eats too much!"

290
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:42,165
How does that skeleton know about that?

291
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,565
-What's wrong? -It was just an example.

292
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:48,365
-You actually had eel? -What?

293
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:52,765
You'll turn into an eel if you eat too much.

294
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,865
Okay.

295
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,665
Hey, that first sentence...

296
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:04,665
Couldn't it be "something is" with "ga" instead of "wa"?

297
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,865
I don't think so.

298
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:09,565
Take a look.

299
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,065
The second character in the third sentence has sonant marks.

300
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,765
It must be a character belonging

301
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:18,765
to the "ga", "za", "da" or "ba" rows.

302
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:22,765
So if the character before the comma is "ga",

303
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:26,065
then there should be a sonant mark above it.

304
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:30,365
But this character isn't necessarily "ha".

305
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:33,565
Whether or not people put commas in the middle of their sentences

306
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:36,165
is personal preference.

307
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:41,765
Either way, we'll probably need something else to crack the code.

308
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,165
Something else?

309
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,765
Is everyone studying quietly?

310
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,365
Yes...

311
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:53,365
Is the staff meeting over?

312
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:56,565
Sorry, we'll be a while longer.

313
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:59,265
We just came to check on everyone.

314
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,665
And I forgot something.

315
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,865
I'm sorry. It won't take much longer.

316
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:08,565
Just keep studying, please.

317
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,865
Ms. Wakasa.

318
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:11,865
Yes?

319
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:16,665
I'm sorry, but could you put these rulers away in the prep room?

320
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:18,365
Yes.

321
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:23,565
Oh, right. Ms. Kobayashi...

322
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:27,265
The schedule!

323
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:29,365
The schedule?

324
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,465
It's torn.

325
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,265
Calm down, Ms. Wakasa.

326
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,665
We can rewrite it.

327
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,465
But...

328
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,565
I found a schedule.

329
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,065
It looks pretty old.

330
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:47,265
The paper is really worn.

331
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:49,865
There are lots of blank spaces.

332
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,765
Maybe they didn't finish filling in it.

333
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,165
Ayumi!

334
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:58,165
You picked up a schedule in the storage shed, right?

335
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:00,865
Yeah, I still have it.

336
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,165
See?

337
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:06,065
Did you figure something out, Conan?

338
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,665
I see. So that's how it is!

339
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:16,665
Now that I take a closer look,

340
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:18,865
there's something wrong with this schedule, isn't there?

341
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:21,565
What? Wrong how?

342
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:23,565
Look at this line.

343
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:28,265
There's Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, and Sun.

344
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,165
It must be Sunday, right?

345
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,465
You're right.

346
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,165
But there's no school on Sunday.

347
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:37,565
And then, there's this homeroom period on Tuesday.

348
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:41,865
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

349
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,765
It's seventh period.

350
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,965
Surely not even upperclassmen

351
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:49,165
have seven class periods in grade school.

352
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:58,065
Then, what is this chart?

353
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,965
Since it was in the storage shed

354
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:04,165
where we found the skeleton holding the code,

355
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:06,365
this is probably...

356
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,365
Probably?

357
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,465
"Next Episode"

358
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,165
I'm disappointed, though.

359
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,965
We couldn't crack the code.

360
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:01,065
Yeah.

361
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,065
Who cares?

362
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:05,465
-I'm opening it. -Okay.

363
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,065
Here goes.

364
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,365
I'm so hungry.

365
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,565
Yeah. Let's go home!

366
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,465
-Yeah. -Yes.

367
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:24,265
Next Conan, "The New Teacher's Skeleton Case (Part 2)"

368
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:27,508
Next Conan's Hint:

369
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,408
