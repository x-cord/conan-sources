1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:04,182
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:06,182
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:07,782
The case takes place the night before the wedding,

4
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:09,582
the one you love is very close.

5
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:11,282
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,182
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,682
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:58,995
Heiji and Kazuha come to Tokyo to attend an acquaintance's wedding.

9
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,195
While we are giving them a tour of the city,

10
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,795
we run into Shigematsu, the butler for the Morizono family

11
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:05,095
whose son is getting married.

12
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:08,795
Invited for a dinner by Shigematsu, we go to the estate.

13
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,295
But later that night,

14
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:15,295
he is murdered in a locked room.

15
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:20,895
Kazuha then discovers a connection between two of the suspects.

16
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:29,495
"Murder Behind Locked Doors on the Night Before the Wedding (Part 2)"

17
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:33,495
What? You can't find the weapon?

18
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:37,095
Yes, we're searching inside and outside the residence

19
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:38,095
but nothing's turned up be.

20
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,695
That's impossible.

21
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,895
It has to be somewhere around here.

22
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:47,495
The weapon used to stab the butler, Shigematsu has to be around here.

23
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,195
Not only the weapon,

24
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:52,695
you might find the bloody clothes the killer wore.

25
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:55,795
Look at Shigematsu's wound,

26
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:58,295
he lost a lot of blood.

27
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:01,695
I'm pretty sure a lot of blood got onto the killer

28
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,695
when he pulled the knife out.

29
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,095
You're right.

30
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:06,695
But Inspector,

31
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:10,595
if the killer was a burglar who just happened to sneak in,

32
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,695
it's possible he's already faraway and the weapon's with him.

33
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,395
No, that's not possible.

34
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,495
It isn't?

35
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:19,795
Security around this estate is tight.

36
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,395
The only outsiders entering the grounds

37
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:26,095
were we police and the mass media after the body was found.

38
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:32,095
Besides, the door and every window was found locked.

39
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:33,895
A burglar who just happened to break in

40
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,895
wouldn't be able to pull off a stunt like that.

41
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:37,595
Which means the killer

42
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,795
is someone who doesn't have an alibi

43
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:44,895
and is very familiar with this place, namely, one of those five.

44
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,395
So how'd it go?

45
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:49,595
You questioned them didn't you, Inspector?

46
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,895
Yes.

47
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:52,495
The head of the household,

48
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:54,695
Mikio was in his room waiting for Shigematsu

49
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,395
who was supposed to meet him there.

50
00:03:57,395 --> 00:04:00,695
His daughter, Yurie was alone and taking a bath.

51
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:03,295
His son, Kikuhito was in his room

52
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,795
listening to music and reading a magazine.

53
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:07,695
Sakuraba, the hired help was searching the place

54
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:11,695
looking for the cat.

55
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:14,195
Kaede claims she was taking a nap

56
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:16,095
while waiting for someone from her home to come for her,

57
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,795
she's the most suspicious.

58
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:19,795
Why is that?

59
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:22,495
Yurie said she went to her room

60
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,095
to ask her to join her in the bath

61
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,395
but there was no answer.

62
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,195
What happened?

63
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:32,495
There so much broken glass.

64
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:36,795
Truth is after we found the body,

65
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,895
Sakuraba was angered by Kikuhito's insensitive remarks

66
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,695
and he attacked Kikuhito.

67
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:46,195
The force sent Kikuhito flying into the window.

68
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,595
Inspector Megure, please come here.

69
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,695
What is it, Tome?

70
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:53,295
Take a look at this.

71
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:54,995
Did you find something?

72
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:59,395
There's a little blood behind this latch.

73
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:00,695
You're right.

74
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:04,295
It looks like someone with a bloody glove grabbed it.

75
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:09,595
Which means the killer opened then closed this window.

76
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,395
But what'd the killer do?

77
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,495
The window was locked from the inside.

78
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:15,495
Hey, Hattori.

79
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:18,795
Here, look at this piece of glass.

80
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:21,095
There's a small hole in it.

81
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:22,995
Hey? I wonder how.

82
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:26,095
That hole wasn't there before it broke.

83
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:28,495
I don't blame you for missing it.

84
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,595
By looking at the shape of this piece,

85
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:34,595
it seems the hole was made at the very edge of the frame.

86
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,695
Which means there should be more.

87
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:40,695
Yes, "it" should be somewhere on the veranda.

88
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:44,695
Inspector, may I have a word with you?

89
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:46,495
Yes, what is it?

90
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:50,295
How much longer are you going to leave Shigematsu like this?

91
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:52,395
Before he became our butler,

92
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,095
he was a close friend to both my wife and me.

93
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:58,295
If it's possible, I'd like to take the body

94
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:01,895
and have funeral services performed,

95
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,295
he'll be buried close to my wife. She would like that.

96
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,795
I'm sorry,

97
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:09,695
we can't release the body until the autopsy's over.

98
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:12,395
I see. That's too bad.

99
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:17,595
So that story mom told me was true.

100
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:18,795
What story?

101
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,295
Mom told me that Mrs. Morizono, who died 4 years ago

102
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:25,495
was really in love with Shigematsu.

103
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:30,095
She used to come to this estate to see Shigematsu

104
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,995
but Morizono misunderstood and thought she was in love with him

105
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:35,095
so he proposed to her.

106
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,895
Both of their parents were in favor of the marriage

107
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,395
and she didn't know what to do

108
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:40,895
but Morizono's feelings for her won her over

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,695
and they got married.

110
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,695
That's that she told my mom.

111
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,995
The wife and the butler.

112
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,695
It sounds pretty fishy.

113
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:52,495
That's right, sounds familiar doesn't it?

114
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,795
Like those two with the matching pendants.

115
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,295
By the way Hattori,

116
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,195
did you find what we were talking about?

117
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:00,995
I couldn't find it anywhere.

118
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:03,395
If the killer escaped through this veranda,

119
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:05,995
there's bound to be some.

120
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:09,895
I think we should try it out on the veranda in the next room.

121
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,895
Try what out?

122
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:13,695
You know what I mean.

123
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:17,895
We're going to see if you can really get down from the veranda.

124
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:20,195
Who's going to do it?

125
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:23,195
You're the only one who can do it, Heiji.

126
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,195
Kudo, make real sure the rope won't get loose.

127
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,995
You don't have to remind me.

128
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:33,995
Who would do this?

129
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,695
Hey, how'd it go Hattori?

130
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:43,695
It was easier than I thought.

131
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:47,995
Which means, the killer must've gotten down by the veranda.

132
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:49,895
What's that?

133
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:52,595
Something's caught in the tree.

134
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:53,695
Where?

135
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:57,195
There, in the tree right in front of the room the body's in...

136
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,495
What're you doing?

137
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,195
Kudo! Hang on, I'll be right there!

138
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,895
Oh dear. Ran! Isn't that Conan?

139
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,195
I don't believe it.

140
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,795
-Hey, kid. -You there!

141
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:18,895
Don't just stand there!

142
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:21,095
Do something quick and save him!

143
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:24,695
Save him? I... I'm...

144
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:39,095
That was close.

145
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:41,595
What's going on here?

146
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,395
This kid was about to fall.

147
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,395
Oh my!

148
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,295
You! Why didn't you help him?

149
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,895
You were right there!

150
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:54,295
Wait! He couldn't help it.

151
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:58,895
Kikuhito's been terribly afraid of heights since he was a child.

152
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:02,795
That's right, Shigematsu mentioned something like that.

153
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:05,495
By the way, Hattori, about that thing...

154
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:08,595
Oh yeah, let's go check it out.

155
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,695
Now what're you two up to?

156
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,195
Why are you climbing this tree?

157
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:14,395
Be careful.

158
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,495
I see it. There.

159
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,595
Is it a bloody shirt?

160
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:23,595
There's bloody gloves and...

161
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,895
A knife.

162
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:32,295
Just as I thought, there's tape on it.

163
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:35,795
I figured out who the killer is and how the locked room trick was done.

164
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:38,895
-The case is hereby closed. -The case is hereby closed.

165
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,895
Something doesn't feel right.

166
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:47,295
Yeah. And we've still got a lot of keywords dangling in the air.

167
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,595
It's starting to rain.

168
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,195
It's starting to rain harder.

169
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:53,595
Hey, it's starting to rain.

170
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,195
It is?

171
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,595
Hey, wait a minute. I'm pretty sure...

172
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:58,895
The rain shutters.

173
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:03,395
Yes, I see.

174
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,095
If that's how it happened,

175
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,495
then the weapon not found on the scene,

176
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:10,595
the bloodstains from dragging the body,

177
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:13,395
the light out in the next room,

178
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,795
the cat in the room with the body,

179
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:19,595
and the evidence packaged neatly like this...

180
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:22,895
Everything fits perfectly!

181
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:26,095
I'm positive he's the killer.

182
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,995
But what can we do?

183
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,495
We don't have any proof.

184
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:33,795
Then we'll just get the killer to...

185
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:35,295
Confess!

186
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:41,295
Kazuha. Tell everyone to meet us in the room the murder took place.

187
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,495
What for?

188
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:46,195
Ran, ask the Inspector to come here.

189
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:49,995
Tell him Heiji has something very interesting to tell him.

190
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,095
Right?

191
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,195
Right.

192
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,895
What's going on?

193
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:56,295
Why does he want us all here?

194
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,695
Sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:03,695
Hey, why'd you call us all here?

196
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,595
Don't tell me you're going to put on a mystery show.

197
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,695
That's right, I am...

198
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:09,795
-What? -What?

199
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,695
I figured out who the killer is

200
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:15,095
and how the locked room trick was done.

201
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,295
The person responsible for stabbing Shigematsu

202
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,795
and escaping while locking the room is...

203
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:22,095
you!

204
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:23,595
Sakuraba!

205
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:24,795
You're kidding.

206
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:27,595
I don't believe Sakuraba is the murderer.

207
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:28,795
It can't be.

208
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,595
I don't believe it.

209
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,195
You have an explanation, don't you?

210
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,895
How the murder behind locked doors was committed...

211
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,095
There, I did it.

212
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:45,095
The key to the trick was this tiny hole in the glass.

213
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,595
A hole?

214
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:50,195
The crime lab technicians have already checked it.

215
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,895
And this.

216
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:56,195
The end has been tied into a loop and then taped.

217
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,695
First you take the string to the latch, and put looped end over it.

218
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:04,895
Next, put looped end over it, then pass the other end,

219
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,795
through the hole in the glass,

220
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,295
and then you go out on the veranda,

221
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,895
close the window without locking it.

222
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:14,795
All you have to do now is pull the string carefully...

223
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:18,895
It locked.

224
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,895
Then you give one hard tug

225
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:23,895
and the string will pull out of the tape.

226
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:27,095
All that's left is to pull the string from the outside,

227
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:29,995
and you have your murder in a locked room.

228
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:34,395
But once the police see the hole, they'll figure it out right away...

229
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:38,195
That's why Sakuraba punched Kikuhito.

230
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,395
He used Kikuhito to break the glass

231
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,395
so the police wouldn't find it.

232
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:47,695
But he hit him because what Kikuhito said was cruel.

233
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,795
That doesn't matter!

234
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:54,195
Sakuraba was waiting for an opportunity to break the glass.

235
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:58,595
Unfortunately, it didn't break in a way to hide the hole.

236
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:02,595
But that's not enough to prove he's the killer.

237
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,995
Think carefully.

238
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,995
The killer got down from that veranda.

239
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,395
Mr. Morizono has a bad leg,

240
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:12,095
he wouldn't be able to something so strenuous

241
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:15,095
and it's too difficult for Yurie and Kaede because they're women.

242
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:19,095
We can strike Kikuhito out since he's afraid of heights,

243
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:22,395
the only one left is Sakuraba who is agile

244
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:24,295
and easily climbed up the tree to get the cat...

245
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:27,595
Yes, you!

246
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:31,495
You stabbed Shigematsu to death in this room,

247
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:34,495
used the trick I just showed to lock the window

248
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,795
then got down from the veranda,

249
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:40,295
and rushed here with everyone else acting like nothing happened.

250
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:43,795
Well? Did I miss something, Sakuraba?

251
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,695
You're wrong. I didn't do it.

252
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,595
I didn't kill anyone.

253
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:52,195
He's right. Sakuraba couldn't be the killer.

254
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,995
Because...

255
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:59,295
until he heard the scream and rushed over,

256
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,695
he was with me.

257
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,885
Is that the truth?

258
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:19,685
Yes, we were looking around the house for the cat.

259
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:23,385
Then why didn't you tell us this before?

260
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:24,785
Because...

261
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:27,685
You didn't want anyone to know your relationship with him?

262
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:29,085
What relationship?

263
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:32,085
They're both wearing the same pendant.

264
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:35,485
That proves they're deeply involved with each other.

265
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,885
I see, so they're lovers.

266
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:41,585
Mr. Morizono suggested she marry his son

267
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:43,985
and Shigematsu tried to break

268
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:46,285
then up so they killed him, is that it?

269
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,085
No. I didn't do it.

270
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,785
You can explain everything down at the station...

271
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:51,885
Please wait.

272
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,385
We really were together at that time.

273
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:55,985
I'm very sorry

274
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:59,185
but we can't accept the testimony

275
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:01,485
of someone closely involved with the accused.

276
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,685
That's not fair.

277
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,185
Take him away!

278
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:06,185
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,385
No. It wasn't me.

280
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:10,785
Please believe me.

281
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,185
I honestly didn't...

282
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,485
Sakuraba.

283
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:15,785
Sakuraba! No...

284
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,985
Here, wipe your tears.

285
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,585
I'll wait for as long as it takes

286
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:28,585
for you to forget about him and accept me.

287
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:35,485
I can't believe Sakuraba killed Shigematsu.

288
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:36,885
It's unthinkable.

289
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:39,685
It may be difficult to believe, but it's the truth.

290
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,685
There's no denying it, he's the inhuman,

291
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:46,685
ruthless murderer who killed the gentle Shigematsu.

292
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:47,985
Heiji.

293
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:52,985
Oh well, if we find the murder weapon in his room,

294
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,885
the murderer will have to confess.

295
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,685
You mean you haven't found it yet?

296
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,585
We're leaving for today

297
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,485
but we'll be back tomorrow to search for the weapon.

298
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:08,885
Well, I guess we should be going too.

299
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,485
Hey.

300
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,585
It's late, why don't we stay here tonight?

301
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:14,785
Is that okay?

302
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:45,985
"Sakuraba"

303
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,685
So, it was you after all.

304
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:05,985
Kikuhito?

305
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,885
I guess you figured you'd plant the evidence

306
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:13,885
in Sakuraba's things to make him look guiltier,

307
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:16,285
but you didn't fool me.

308
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,385
You don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,285
I have acrophobia, I could never commit that crime.

310
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:23,485
That trick's a fake.

311
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:25,485
And to prove it, there's blood smudged on the latch

312
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,185
as if a gloved hand touched it

313
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,885
but there's nothing outside on the veranda.

314
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:32,785
A killer who is so careful enough to use gloves

315
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,085
wouldn't deliberately take them off

316
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,285
when making his escape from the veranda.

317
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:41,285
Then how did I work that locked room trick?

318
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:43,285
You didn't need a trick.

319
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:47,385
You were in that room from the very start!

320
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:48,685
What?

321
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:50,785
I'm pretty sure you were hiding

322
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:54,685
behind the left curtain in the next room.

323
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,385
Isn't that why you closed the shutter on only that side?

324
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:02,485
So no one on the outside would be able to see you.

325
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,185
You opened the hole in the glass beforehand

326
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,285
and prepared the taped string

327
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:09,285
then you asked Shigematsu to meet you there

328
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,985
and you killed him.

329
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:15,485
The blood splashed onto Sakuraba's shirt,

330
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,985
the one you stole sometime before.

331
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:21,785
You dragged the body into the next room,

332
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:24,385
then wrapped the murder weapon and gloves in the shirt

333
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,785
and threw it out the window.

334
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,985
You saw us through the window and...

335
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,585
So you broke the glass to make us come here

336
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:36,185
then hid behind the curtain.

337
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:40,185
When we broke the door down and entered the room,

338
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,585
the trail of blood caught our attention

339
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,185
and led us into the next room

340
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:45,485
where we concentrated on the body.

341
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,585
That's when you came out of hiding.

342
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,485
It was dark and on top of that, the body had all our attention

343
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:52,085
so no one noticed you.

344
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:55,885
Then you made it appear as if you'd come with the others

345
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,985
when you heard the scream.

346
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,985
You put the cat in the room

347
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:03,185
to make Sakuraba's alibi seem suspicious.

348
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,785
Because you knew your father would make him go look for it

349
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,285
once he knew the cat was missing.

350
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:11,285
But anyone could have done it.

351
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,285
No, only you could've done it.

352
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:18,985
And the proof's the evidence tied in a bundle.

353
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:23,385
A perpetrator usually doesn't put all the proofs of evidence in one bundle.

354
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:26,085
But an acrophobic like you wouldn't be able to go out on the veranda

355
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:29,985
so you used the knife as weight and threw the bundle out the window.

356
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:33,085
You made him hit you so the glass with the hole would break,

357
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:34,985
you planned it.

358
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:39,885
It would look like he did it to destroy the evidence.

359
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:43,885
What are you talking about?

360
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:47,185
I came here to help solve the case.

361
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,485
I just found this knife in his bag.

362
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,485
You fool. Take a good look.

363
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,285
That isn't his bag.

364
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:56,685
It's mine.

365
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:01,785
Besides, the real Sakuraba's room is next door.

366
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,385
Everything, this bag and this room,

367
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:07,185
even the evidence we left hanging in the tree

368
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,885
and Sakuraba's faked arrest,

369
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:14,185
it was all a trap the Inspector and we put together.

370
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:15,885
So you'd put your guard down

371
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:19,385
and make a move proving your guilt.

372
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:26,685
It was all his fault.

373
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,485
He threatened to tell dad

374
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:30,485
about the crooked dealings my company was involved in

375
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,785
unless I called off the wedding.

376
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,085
He's the one who suggested we get married,

377
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,385
I didn't understand.

378
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:39,285
I thought that even if I called off the wedding,

379
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,885
he'd continue to blackmail me.

380
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,985
That's why I decided to kill him

381
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:44,485
and let Sakuraba take the blame since he stole my fiancee.

382
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,485
He didn't steal your fiancee.

383
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:52,085
Kaede was coming here to see Sakuraba all along.

384
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,385
Shigematsu misunderstood,

385
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:58,385
like your father did many years ago.

386
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,285
You're lying. He never said anything like that.

387
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,885
He probably couldn't because he knew how disappointed you'd be,

388
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,885
he wanted to spare you.

389
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,985
After all he himself suggested the marriage.

390
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:12,585
I doubt he really meant to blackmail you.

391
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:16,485
He just wanted to get you to cancel the wedding somehow,

392
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,285
so the two of them could get married.

393
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:24,885
Because he was once in the same situation a long time ago.

394
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:58,085
"Tokyo Station" -Thanks for everything old man.

395
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,985
Sure, now we're even since you took us around in Osaka.

396
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:04,285
I'm still mad you put on that show

397
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:05,985
without even discussing it with me.

398
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:06,985
To fool the enemy,

399
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,885
you must first fool your friends, or so the saying goes.

400
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,785
Hey, what happened to Sakuraba and Kaede?

401
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,185
You went to see them didn't you?

402
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:18,285
Yeah, I apologized for treating him like a perpetrator.

403
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:21,385
That Kazuha's late.

404
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,285
Forgive me, Ran.

405
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:25,085
I'm so embarrassed I could die.

406
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,685
Good grief. We're already here forget about it.

407
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:28,785
Now go.

408
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,185
What's going on, Kazuha?

409
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,885
You're wearing stripes too?

410
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:34,285
It... it's not what you think.

411
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:35,885
This is Ran's.

412
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:39,085
I don't know why but she made me wear it.

413
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,785
I'd better go to the restroom and change.

414
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:41,985
Come back here.

415
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,885
It doesn't bother me, you don't have to change.

416
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:48,685
Besides, it kind of looks like...

417
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:51,485
Looks like what?

418
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:53,785
It looks kind of funny, like we're brother and sister.

419
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,685
More like a comedy duo to me.

420
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,985
"Next Episode"

421
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:25,085
He's dead.

422
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:29,685
Next Conan,

423
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,306
"The Astronomical Observation"

424
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:36,387
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:38,087
"Photo of the stars"

426
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:40,787
In the next episode, stars rain down at night.

427
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,787
Bring the net.
