1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.850
As long as modern-day
crimes involve people,

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.890
there are no
unsolvable mysteries!

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.730
Today's guests are super special!

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.690
Relationships can be complex things!

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.600
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.640
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.310
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.219
The Ojamanbo Murder Case.

9
00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.159
Sunday, 7:00 a.m.

10
00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.859
Come on, Dad!

11
00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.219
Are you worn out already?

12
00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.439
Don't blame me,
blame my hangover...

13
00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.399
He's the one who suggested
it in the first place...

14
00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.359
Yeah. We just came along...

15
00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.359
Okay, only two more
kilometers to the park!

16
00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.159
Come on, you can do it!

17
00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.609
Let's take a break for a minute...

18
00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:27.619
Ojamanbo Cleaning Company, Eastern
Business Director, Tsunehisa Fujii (27)
Let's take a break for a minute...

19
00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.579
Ojamanbo Cleaning Company, Eastern
Business Director, Tsunehisa Fujii (27)

20
00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.249
What's this?

21
00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.859
Over here!

22
00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.579
You two stay here!

23
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.329
Ojamanbo Cleaning Company,
President, Hideyuki Nakayama (29)

24
00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.579
Asagi-san! Asagi-san!

25
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.739
Ojamanbo Cleaning Company,
President's Secretary, Kuniko Asagi (31)

26
00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.539
Yes? Is something the matter, sir?
Ojamanbo Cleaning Company,
President's Secretary, Kuniko Asagi (31)

27
00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.819
It appears something
happened outside.

28
00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.509
Could you go take a look for me?

29
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.409
Yes, of course.

30
00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.409
Hey, call an ambulance!

31
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.929
This looks bad!

32
00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.059
It's the same drawing as that truck's.

33
00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.319
He's dead.

34
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.489
It looks like that iron
girder fell on him from above...

35
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.659
Neither of the buildings have windows.

36
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.489
Meaning this
girder fell from the roof?

37
00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.909
Who are you?

38
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.359
We were cleaning the
building across the street--

39
00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.699
we're from Ojamanbo.

40
00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.159
Sorry to ask, but could you
check out this abandoned building?

41
00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.319
Someone might have
dropped the girder from it.

42
00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.709
Right!

43
00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.969
Oh? Those are our--

44
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.569
It's just my luck that
I'd run into a big incident

45
00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.799
first thing Sunday morning...

46
00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.259
Fujii-san!

47
00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.239
You know him?!

48
00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.529
Yes! He's one of
our company's directors!

49
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.479
But why?

50
00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.069
So Fujii-san was on his
way from his office up ahead

51
00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.119
to the main office here?

52
00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:38.659
Yes. He was supposed to meet
the company president at 9:00.

53
00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.839
Oh, that's right!
I need to inform him about this!

54
00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:42.549
Sir!

55
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.259
Asagi-san. What happened?

56
00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.959
It's Director Fujii...

57
00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:48.829
Did something happen to him?

58
00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:51.809
Fujii!

59
00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:53.489
Asagi-san!

60
00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:57.159
Move the Manbo Mobile away
from that building right away!

61
00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.109
It'll be in the way when
the police get here! Hurry!

62
00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:00.689
Right!

63
00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.359
But why did this happen?

64
00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.179
Come on in.

65
00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.049
What's that switch for?

66
00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.009
Now, then. When
the incident occurred,

67
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.239
Nakayama-san was in this room,

68
00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:32.219
and Asagi-san was in
the room next door. Right?

69
00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:33.489
Yes.

70
00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:36.429
Is there anyone
who can vouch for this?

71
00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:38.389
Sorry?

72
00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.819
The truth is, right after the incident,

73
00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.779
Mori-kun here asked
your employees to inspect

74
00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.989
the abandoned building next door.

75
00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:46.909
Yes, so I've heard.

76
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.489
But they didn't find
anyone suspicious, right?

77
00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:50.239
Nope.

78
00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.659
But when I thought hard about it,

79
00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.819
I realized there's
also a high possibility

80
00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.829
the iron girder was dropped
from the roof of this building.

81
00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.569
Floors 3 and up belong
to a parent company.

82
00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.529
I hear floors 1 and 2 are
being rented out to your company.

83
00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.069
And from what
the security guard told us,

84
00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.949
the parent company above
you is closed because it's Sunday.

85
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.159
Other than Nakayama-san and Asagi-san,

86
00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.599
nobody had entered this building.

87
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.559
That's what he said.

88
00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.159
So you want to know our alibis?

89
00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.529
I don't know what to say.

90
00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:29.359
There wasn't anyone
else to vouch for us...

91
00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.989
This switch is--

92
00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.119
I can see the road out front!

93
00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.079
Judging from this angle,
there must be a camera on the roof!

94
00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.159
It's recording!

95
00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:51.489
Now I see! The camera's
angle changes automatically!

96
00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:53.909
Which means that when it's on manual

97
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.279
you use this stick
to change the angle...

98
00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.159
Hey, you! Don't touch
other people's things!

99
00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.489
Is this your wife, Nakayama-san?

100
00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:09.199
No, that's my sister.

101
00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.319
Your sister?

102
00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:14.779
Yes. But she passed away this January...

103
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.949
Dad!

104
00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.159
I'm sorry to hear that...

105
00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.069
But becoming a company
president at such a young age...

106
00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.749
That's really something!

107
00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.239
This company was originally just me,
Fujii, and my sister Kumiko

108
00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:31.109
back in my college days.

109
00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:33.469
We originally started it
as a "jack-of-all-trades" shop.

110
00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:36.529
We came up with the name "Ojamanbo"

111
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:41.489
because we would actively go
to random homes and demand work.

112
00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:42.429
I see.

113
00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:47.279
But to our delight, the business
did much better than we ever expected.

114
00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.159
Two years later,
we took our first step into cleaning

115
00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.439
by creating the
Ojamanbo Cleaning Company.

116
00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:56.909
I took the role
of company president,

117
00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:01.609
and Fujii oversaw work as business
director of the eastern region.

118
00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:04.739
My sister worked as my secretary,

119
00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:07.449
but she died in
an accident in January.

120
00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:09.319
Inspector.

121
00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:12.529
I'll tell you since you'd
eventually find out anyway,

122
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:15.859
there was some
trouble between me and Fujii.

123
00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:16.719
Trouble?

124
00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:22.989
Fujii was going to start his
own cleaning company by himself.

125
00:08:22.989 --> 00:08:26.659
Because of this, he tried to take
several highly-skilled employees

126
00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:28.819
along with him, so...

127
00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:33.529
Whenever we met, we always
clashed with each other.

128
00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:37.489
I was supposed to talk
with Fujii again today.

129
00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:38.819
I got it!

130
00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:40.659
You already figured it out?!

131
00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:45.239
Nakayama-san was the one
who dropped the girder from the roof!

132
00:08:45.239 --> 00:08:47.989
Asagi-san and Nakayama-san are lovers,

133
00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:52.089
so she's lying to cover for him!

134
00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:57.009
What's so funny?

135
00:08:57.319 --> 00:09:00.969
As if he and I would ever be lovers!

136
00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:04.989
Sorry, but you're wrong, Mori-san.

137
00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:08.189
The reason being that
she's getting married next month!

138
00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:11.279
Married?

139
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:14.149
Inspector!

140
00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:16.819
It wasn't much, but we found
a mark made by an iron girder

141
00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:18.569
on the roof of the building next door.

142
00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:19.819
What?!

143
00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:22.529
So the girder fell from the
roof of the abandoned building!

144
00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:26.499
We also found this harmonica
lying next to the body...

145
00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:30.459
His name's on it, so it would
seem it belongs to Fujii-san...

146
00:09:30.909 --> 00:09:33.569
Yes, that's his.

147
00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:35.799
I've seen it on several occasions.

148
00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:39.759
However, we couldn't
find any fingerprints on it at all.

149
00:09:41.489 --> 00:09:45.319
It's clean, almost as if
it had been wiped with a cloth.

150
00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:48.909
If it belongs to Fujii-san,
shouldn't his fingerprints be on it?

151
00:09:48.909 --> 00:09:51.099
Yes, but...

152
00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:53.909
I just remembered
some unimportant business.

153
00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:55.909
Would you mind
if I leave for just a bit?

154
00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:57.429
No, that would be fine.

155
00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:58.449
Thank you.

156
00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:02.659
Asagi-san. Contact Fujii-kun's
parents and fiancée.

157
00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:03.319
Right!

158
00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:08.779
Fujii-san has a fiancée?

159
00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:11.489
Yes. Apparently she's the
daughter of a wealthy man,

160
00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:13.659
and the start-up funds
for his new company

161
00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:15.959
were supposed to come from him.

162
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:19.719
Say, how did
Nakayama-san's sister die?

163
00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.739
She was in an accident.

164
00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:22.659
An accident?

165
00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:23.429
Yes.

166
00:10:23.989 --> 00:10:26.989
Apparently she had a
big argument with her brother

167
00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:28.489
and quit in December.

168
00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:31.639
I was hired as her replacement.

169
00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.609
But she took a part-time
job at a construction company

170
00:10:36.609 --> 00:10:40.569
and was hit in the head by an
iron girder on a construction site.

171
00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:41.949
Come again?!

172
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:45.029
That's exactly the same as
what happened this morning!

173
00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:49.499
That's why I've been thinking about
how terrible coincidences can be...

174
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:52.209
Was it really a coincidence, though?

175
00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:55.159
Could his sister's
death have some relevance

176
00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:58.359
to the truth behind this incident?

177
00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:02.219
If so, then it's highly likely
that Nakayama-san did it!

178
00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:04.679
But how?!

179
00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:07.859
At any rate, I'm going to
re-question the employees

180
00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:10.019
who were cleaning the
building across the street.

181
00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:12.249
You folks stay here.

182
00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:14.069
Understood.

183
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:15.229
Let's go.

184
00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:16.229
Yes, sir!

185
00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:21.279
After entering this room, Nakayama-san
switched the camera to Auto.

186
00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:26.239
If he's the killer, then it
must be the key to something!

187
00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:32.959
I can see the road out front!
This is neat!

188
00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:37.359
Oh, a security camera
on the roof is recording that.

189
00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:38.659
A security camera?

190
00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:43.159
Yes. The company president
is always checking the monitor

191
00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:46.639
to make sure there's no litter
on the street in front of the building.

192
00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:51.319
I see. So it's the policy of the
president of a cleaning company.

193
00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:54.189
Yes. His concepts are always unique--

194
00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:56.909
the Manbo Mobile was his idea too!

195
00:11:56.909 --> 00:12:01.649
Parking it in front of a spotless
building makes for great publicity!

196
00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:04.489
Say, this is set on Auto,

197
00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:07.199
but do you think we could see
inside that alley if it was on Manual?

198
00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:10.409
I'm not sure.
Why don't you try and see?

199
00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:11.009
Okay!

200
00:12:21.989 --> 00:12:23.539
Can't see it at all, huh?

201
00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:24.539
No.

202
00:12:28.989 --> 00:12:30.559
What's this strap?

203
00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:32.389
Binoculars?!

204
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:34.239
Conan-kun!

205
00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:37.249
You know better than to
open other people's drawers!

206
00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:43.399
I'm gonna go up to the roof!

207
00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:50.409
So that's the security camera.

208
00:12:50.409 --> 00:12:52.009
It's pretty big...

209
00:12:56.659 --> 00:13:00.129
The abandoned building next
door is one floor shorter than this one...

210
00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:03.589
That must be the mark
made by the sliding iron girder.

211
00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:05.909
This height difference
would make it impossible

212
00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:08.029
to return the girder up
here if it had been lowered

213
00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:10.049
onto the abandoned building.

214
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:14.319
Which means Nakayama-san
couldn't have dropped it--

215
00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:16.989
he was inside this building.

216
00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:20.019
Plus, he was in his
office when it happened!

217
00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:27.699
Wait a minute! It's possible that--

218
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:31.159
Here we go!

219
00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:33.159
It's not much, but there's
a fresh scratch mark here

220
00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.449
from something thin!

221
00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.529
There's no doubt about it!

222
00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:42.159
Using this method, it would
be possible to drop the girder

223
00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:43.959
even from his office!

224
00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:47.829
But how did he know
Fujii-san was in the alley?!

225
00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:52.639
Wait!

226
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.659
No good.

227
00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.569
None of the lower floors
reflect what's in the alley!

228
00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:08.409
Was it really impossible for
Nakayama-san to have done it?!

229
00:14:08.409 --> 00:14:10.029
Conan-kun?

230
00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:12.159
What are you doing?

231
00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:14.489
Nothing really...

232
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:17.079
Wait! Come to think of it...

233
00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:18.859
Asagi-san!

234
00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.869
Move the Manbo Mobile away
from that building right away!

235
00:14:22.489 --> 00:14:24.069
Now I see!

236
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:27.739
That's why the harmonica
didn't have any fingerprints on it!

237
00:14:27.739 --> 00:14:29.879
Nakayama-san really did do it!

238
00:14:32.319 --> 00:14:33.469
How'd it go, Inspector?

239
00:14:33.469 --> 00:14:35.239
Not well.

240
00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:37.359
Apparently they had
finished their window-cleaning

241
00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:40.569
and moved on to cleaning
the first floor when it happened.

242
00:14:40.569 --> 00:14:42.489
They said they didn't see anything.

243
00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:43.769
I see...

244
00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:45.159
Darn it!

245
00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.909
Will checking this video prove

246
00:14:46.909 --> 00:14:50.199
that he controlled the
only camera on the roof?!

247
00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:51.739
But will that alone...

248
00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:53.649
...serve as conclusive proof?!

249
00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:08.589
What's this?!

250
00:15:13.317 --> 00:15:16.067
Alright! Now I have evidence!

251
00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:17.507
Sorry to keep you waiting.

252
00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:21.397
Ah, Nakayama-san.
You can leave for today.

253
00:15:21.397 --> 00:15:23.937
We'll contact you at a later time.

254
00:15:23.937 --> 00:15:24.887
I see.

255
00:15:24.887 --> 00:15:26.067
Oh no!

256
00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:29.487
This video'll be erased if he notices it!

257
00:15:29.487 --> 00:15:31.897
I have no choice!
I'll use my usual method!

258
00:15:33.487 --> 00:15:34.817
What?

259
00:15:40.737 --> 00:15:42.147
What is it, Mori-kun?

260
00:15:42.147 --> 00:15:45.907
Inspector. You mustn't
let him leave just yet.

261
00:15:45.907 --> 00:15:50.357
The reason being that I've
seen through the superb trick

262
00:15:50.357 --> 00:15:53.587
Nakayama-san used to murder
Fujii-san from this room.

263
00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:55.237
What?!

264
00:15:55.237 --> 00:15:58.427
So you're saying
Nakayama-san killed him?!

265
00:15:58.427 --> 00:16:03.007
Yes. The key to his trick was
the security camera on the roof.

266
00:16:03.007 --> 00:16:04.467
The security camera?

267
00:16:04.817 --> 00:16:08.987
Nakayama-san placed an iron
girder on top of the building next door

268
00:16:08.987 --> 00:16:13.857
and then connected it to the
security camera with something thin--

269
00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:16.937
piano wire, most likely.

270
00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:21.367
Afterward, when Fujii-san
walked into the alleyway,

271
00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:23.237
he operated the security camera,

272
00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:25.447
which had been
set to Manual in advance.

273
00:16:39.527 --> 00:16:44.937
The reason Nakayama-san had
Asagi-san check what happened outside

274
00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:46.737
was so he could go to the roof

275
00:16:46.737 --> 00:16:49.807
and remove the piano wire
from the camera.

276
00:16:50.237 --> 00:16:52.737
And the reason
he went outside just now

277
00:16:52.737 --> 00:16:55.647
was to dispose of that piano wire.

278
00:16:55.987 --> 00:16:57.147
Am I wrong?

279
00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:02.527
You're not only wrong, but your
theory lacks a vital part, Mori-san.

280
00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:05.647
From in here,
how could I have known what time

281
00:17:05.647 --> 00:17:08.737
Fujii would be in the alley?

282
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.147
I agree.

283
00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:12.567
It would be impossible
to drop the girder on Fujii-san

284
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:14.587
if the timing was even a second off.

285
00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:20.047
In order to have Fujii-san
stop on a specific spot,

286
00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:23.387
Nakayama-san stole
his harmonica in advance

287
00:17:23.387 --> 00:17:25.847
and placed it in the alley.

288
00:17:26.897 --> 00:17:31.307
He then used his binoculars
to see Fujii-san enter the alley.

289
00:17:31.307 --> 00:17:34.517
How? The alley
isn't visible from here!

290
00:17:34.517 --> 00:17:37.187
Inspector. When the incident occurred,

291
00:17:37.187 --> 00:17:39.567
the company's Manbo Mobile was parked

292
00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:41.857
in front of a
building across the street.

293
00:17:41.857 --> 00:17:45.867
The logo's eye was a mirror.

294
00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:46.947
What?!

295
00:17:47.397 --> 00:17:49.487
Do you see now?

296
00:17:49.487 --> 00:17:53.897
Nakayama-san used binoculars to
view the reflection of the alley

297
00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:56.127
and then dropped the girder.

298
00:17:56.527 --> 00:17:58.547
He waited for just the right time...

299
00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:04.647
That's why you had
the Manbo Mobile moved

300
00:18:04.647 --> 00:18:07.217
right after you saw his body.

301
00:18:07.217 --> 00:18:10.347
So that the police
wouldn't figure out your trick.

302
00:18:11.647 --> 00:18:14.737
But you made a mistake.

303
00:18:14.737 --> 00:18:20.147
You dropped the girder before
Fujii-san had picked up the harmonica.

304
00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:25.897
That's why his
fingerprints weren't on it.

305
00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.867
You were flustered.

306
00:18:31.147 --> 00:18:32.937
There's no blaming you.

307
00:18:32.937 --> 00:18:36.327
Because Ran got in your
way at the worst possible time.

308
00:18:43.277 --> 00:18:46.277
But you have no
proof of this, Mori-san.

309
00:18:46.277 --> 00:18:50.897
According to your theory,
I've already disposed of the piano wire.

310
00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:52.747
But there is proof.

311
00:18:53.597 --> 00:18:57.487
After you used the security
camera to drop the girder,

312
00:18:57.487 --> 00:19:00.067
you changed the camera's angle

313
00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:02.317
to make it easier to
remove the piano wire.

314
00:19:02.987 --> 00:19:04.567
During that time,
the camera recorded

315
00:19:04.567 --> 00:19:08.277
the reflection in the glass
windows of the opposite building.

316
00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:10.567
It's all yours, Conan!

317
00:19:11.897 --> 00:19:14.057
Everyone gather over here!

318
00:19:14.057 --> 00:19:15.257
Conan-kun?

319
00:19:19.487 --> 00:19:21.167
Watch closely, everyone.

320
00:19:24.857 --> 00:19:28.737
See the camera in
the glass's reflection?

321
00:19:28.737 --> 00:19:30.097
In just a moment...

322
00:19:32.647 --> 00:19:33.097
Here!

323
00:19:49.327 --> 00:19:50.527
Company president!

324
00:19:54.317 --> 00:19:57.247
My sister and Fujii were lovers.

325
00:19:59.237 --> 00:20:02.897
But Fujii met a rich man's daughter

326
00:20:02.897 --> 00:20:05.127
and ditched my
sister like it was nothing.

327
00:20:05.897 --> 00:20:09.087
As a result,
my sister quit the company.

328
00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:12.397
So it wasn't because
you two had an argument?

329
00:20:12.397 --> 00:20:14.557
I thought so, myself.

330
00:20:14.817 --> 00:20:18.567
Our parents died
when we were very young.

331
00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:21.567
My sister always
saw me as a father-figure,

332
00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:23.237
but now she was confused,

333
00:20:23.237 --> 00:20:26.107
so she quit the company
to get away from her brother.

334
00:20:26.107 --> 00:20:28.567
That's what I thought, anyway.

335
00:20:28.567 --> 00:20:30.487
But that wasn't the case...

336
00:20:32.897 --> 00:20:35.357
After she died in an accident,

337
00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:38.937
I went to her apartment in
Yokohama to tend to her belongings.

338
00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:52.597
I realized everything then.

339
00:20:53.017 --> 00:20:55.677
So then you wiped the
harmonica and put it in the alley?

340
00:20:56.187 --> 00:21:00.237
If Fujii hadn't dumped her,
she wouldn't have died!

341
00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:03.147
I had to make him pay!

342
00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:10.567
But it certainly is ironic, isn't it?

343
00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:15.277
I used the Manbo Mobile's
mirror to commit a murder--

344
00:21:15.277 --> 00:21:20.327
and then I was found guilty because
of my reflection in those windows.

345
00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:23.737
And it was no other
than your own company

346
00:21:23.737 --> 00:21:26.377
that polished those windows.

347
00:21:26.897 --> 00:21:28.237
But of course.

348
00:21:28.237 --> 00:21:30.737
The Ojamanbo Cleaning Company's
cleaning techniques

349
00:21:30.737 --> 00:21:32.367
are the best in the world!

350
00:21:34.487 --> 00:21:36.387
Brother...

351
00:23:14.237 --> 00:23:17.277
I saw the Manbo Mobile go by today.

352
00:23:17.277 --> 00:23:20.277
It looks like the company's still
going even after the president's arrest.

353
00:23:20.277 --> 00:23:24.987
Yeah. But apparently Asagi-san quit.

354
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:27.067
It must have been a real shock to her.

355
00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:28.707
I wonder what she's doing now?

356
00:23:29.237 --> 00:23:30.167
Hello, there!

357
00:23:30.647 --> 00:23:34.777
I'm Ojamanbo's new announcer,
Kuniko Asagi!

358
00:23:36.737 --> 00:23:38.837
I'm honored to be here!

359
00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:42.187
What a strong woman...

360
00:23:53.237 --> 00:23:58.107
No! She must have found a clue
we don't know about yet!

361
00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:01.577
Now that you mention it, Ayako-san
was acting odd this afternoon...

362
00:24:02.617 --> 00:24:04.077
What?!

363
00:24:06.397 --> 00:24:08.497
Don't tell me Ayako-san's in there!

364
00:24:08.937 --> 00:24:10.277
On the next Conan--

365
00:24:10.277 --> 00:24:13.397
The Holmes Freak Murder Case (Part 1).

366
00:24:14.836 --> 00:24:17.112
Next Conan's Hint:

367
00:24:17.112 --> 00:24:19.313
Blanket.
