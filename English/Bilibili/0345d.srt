1
00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:05.532
He wasn't Shinichi.

2
00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:08.632
Heiji Hattori?

3
00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:10.232
Disguise?

4
00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:12.432
It's a disguise?

5
00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:16.232
But his voice and tone were just like Shinichi.

6
00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:17.332
Yes.

7
00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:20.632
Of course.

8
00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:24.732
It's my masterpiece that took me six hours to put him on this disguise.

9
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:26.732
As for his voice, the microphone on his collar

10
00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:31.132
picks up the deduction that Heiji whispers into it,

11
00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:33.832
then Shinichi says it through the microphone on his mask.

12
00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:38.032
That voice output is the speaker on Heiji's necktie.

13
00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:40.232
How do you like it?

14
00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:43.532
A perfect collaboration by Dr. Agasa and I.

15
00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:48.832
Okay! We're okay on this side, Kudo!

16
00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:50.732
Do your thing on your side too, now!

17
00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:59.232
Don't move!

18
00:00:59.232 --> 00:01:02.632
Your body's the blind spot for the rifle.

19
00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:12.132
Now...

20
00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:16.432
get in the car after Ms. Jodie.

21
00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:18.932
Let's take a drive to the police!

22
00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:32.932
Ms. Jodie.

23
00:01:32.932 --> 00:01:34.932
Quick and get in the car!

24
00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:38.332
Ms. Jodie! Are you all right?

25
00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:39.732
Yes.

26
00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:49.932
Don't tell me that?

27
00:01:58.132 --> 00:01:59.932
Shinichi Kudo?

28
00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:02.132
Remember? The kid that you poisoned to death

29
00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:05.532
with the drug made by the organization back then!

30
00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:07.732
Sorry, Vodka.

31
00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:12.232
I make it a policy to forget the name and face...

32
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.632
of the ones I get rid of.

33
00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:17.732
And?

34
00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:19.632
Are you saying that the kid rose from the dead

35
00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:21.132
and appeared as a ghost?

36
00:02:21.132 --> 00:02:23.032
Yeah, I mean no.

37
00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:27.432
Something strange is happening.

38
00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:33.532
Why are you disguised as Shinichi Kudo in the first place anyway?

39
00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:36.332
Sorry! Pops!

40
00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:39.632
I haven't seen Kudo for some time,

41
00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:41.532
so I got kind of lonely.

42
00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:43.532
I figured that if I came out looking like him

43
00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:46.832
and made a deduction, maybe he just might pop out too.

44
00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:52.032
But maybe he's dead, just as rumor has it, don't you think?

45
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:54.432
Darn it! Kid from Osaka,

46
00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:58.832
this is the second time you're pulling this trick!

47
00:02:58.832 --> 00:03:00.932
If Ran were here,

48
00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:02.832
you'd be way gone by now!

49
00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:06.432
Scary. Give me a break.

50
00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:07.932
I had no choice.

51
00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:10.832
After all, Kudo e-mailed me asking me to do this.

52
00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:12.832
He told me that those guys are trying to pull him away from Ai

53
00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:15.032
and do something,

54
00:03:15.032 --> 00:03:18.032
so he wanted me to disguise myself as him and find out about it.

55
00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:21.432
That's why I'm on board this ship!

56
00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.932
But, it sure freaked me out

57
00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:25.232
when I got to his house

58
00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:28.132
and found his mother there.

59
00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:29.832
She seems to have been worried about him,

60
00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:33.232
and hiding for a while in the house watching him.

61
00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.332
Mother?

62
00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:42.432
Hey...

63
00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:46.632
I didn't think she had a special talent to disguise people

64
00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:49.532
but she would even freak Arsene Lupin out too!

65
00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:51.732
Thanks to her,

66
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.032
I didn't have to complete my deduction all bandaged up.

67
00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:58.632
The only one I'm worried about is

68
00:03:58.632 --> 00:04:00.432
the little girl that is left sleeping

69
00:04:00.432 --> 00:04:02.932
and confined in the basement of Dr. Agasa's house.

70
00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:04.932
Kudo says she'll be fine

71
00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:07.432
if she doesn't have the pursuit glasses

72
00:04:07.432 --> 00:04:10.832
hidden somewhere with her

73
00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:12.732
But, if I were her...

74
00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:17.432
knowing that he would be meeting someone dangerous disguised as me,

75
00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.532
I wouldn't be able to wait for him just like that.

76
00:04:20.532 --> 00:04:22.432
I would break the door open

77
00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:25.432
and go after him no matter what.

78
00:04:29.632 --> 00:04:32.032
No matter what, Kudo!

79
00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:33.832
I'd go after you.

80
00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:48.632
Haibara. You...

81
00:05:11.332 --> 00:05:12.432
Haibara?

82
00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:13.632
Darn it!

83
00:05:26.632 --> 00:05:27.832
Don't come!

84
00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:29.232
Stay away!

85
00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:30.232
Go back!

86
00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:31.432
You idiot!

87
00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.432
No, Kudo.

88
00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:35.932
This is my problem!

89
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:39.432
This had nothing to do with you.

90
00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:44.532
That's why...

91
00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:45.832
Don't die!

92
00:05:47.332 --> 00:05:48.832
I don't want you to die!

93
00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.032
So you had the spare pursuit glasses

94
00:06:08.032 --> 00:06:10.932
hidden after all.

95
00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:16.532
Kudo.

96
00:06:16.532 --> 00:06:18.932
Run for it, Haibara!

97
00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:20.332
Hurry!

98
00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.932
Just what are you doing?

99
00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:26.632
Get out of here, Haibara!

100
00:06:26.632 --> 00:06:28.032
Hurry and get out!

101
00:06:28.032 --> 00:06:29.332
Quick!

102
00:06:49.732 --> 00:06:52.632
Goodnight, baby.

103
00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:53.832
And...

104
00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:02.632
Welcome...

105
00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:11.032
Sherry!

106
00:07:20.932 --> 00:07:22.532
The only reason I can think of

107
00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:23.832
for Vermouth to go after Haibara's life

108
00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:26.732
and want me to stay away from her

109
00:07:26.732 --> 00:07:30.532
is because of her identity as actress Chris Vineyard

110
00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:34.232
as well as Sharon since she is both of them.

111
00:07:34.232 --> 00:07:38.532
She was probably acting out two roles under disguise.

112
00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:40.032
If she knows mom,

113
00:07:40.032 --> 00:07:43.732
she would've probably seen pictures of me as a kid,

114
00:07:43.732 --> 00:07:46.832
so she would've easily made out who I am

115
00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:48.532
and I also understand why she wouldn't want

116
00:07:48.532 --> 00:07:50.732
to be messed up with a scandal.

117
00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:53.332
I'll be fine!

118
00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:57.132
Don't worry because I promise to make it back alive!

119
00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:01.132
Is that really true,

120
00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:04.132
Sharon?

121
00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:15.632
Stupid woman.

122
00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:19.732
Screwing up this little boy's plan,

123
00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:23.932
and coming out here on your own initiative to die.

124
00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:29.632
I didn't come here just to die.

125
00:08:29.632 --> 00:08:32.132
I came here to end everything.

126
00:08:32.132 --> 00:08:34.232
Even if you were to be arrested,

127
00:08:34.232 --> 00:08:36.132
as long as I'm alive,

128
00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:40.832
you guys will never stop pursuing me.

129
00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:44.032
But, I'd like you to give me your word.

130
00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:47.732
That you will not lay a hand on anyone else except me.

131
00:08:49.832 --> 00:08:52.732
Will you promise to give me your word?

132
00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:55.632
Okay.

133
00:08:55.632 --> 00:08:57.432
I'll save all the others

134
00:08:57.432 --> 00:08:59.532
except for this woman FBI agent here.

135
00:08:59.532 --> 00:09:02.332
But first, I'll get rid of you, Sherry.

136
00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:03.932
If you want to hold a grudge on anyone,

137
00:09:03.932 --> 00:09:06.032
hate your parents for starting

138
00:09:06.032 --> 00:09:08.932
such a stupid research in the first place.

139
00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:51.296
Cool kid.

140
00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:23.496
No way!

141
00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:24.696
How?

142
00:11:28.596 --> 00:11:30.696
Stop! Calvados!

143
00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.696
Could it be...

144
00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.296
she saw everything?

145
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.196
Stop! Calvados!

146
00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:06.796
Stop!

147
00:12:16.196 --> 00:12:18.196
Can't you hear I'm telling you to stop?

148
00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:41.496
So...

149
00:12:41.496 --> 00:12:44.296
Get away from that brown-haired girl!

150
00:12:46.196 --> 00:12:48.896
If you don't want to die, you'd better hurry!

151
00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:51.196
No! Don't move!

152
00:12:51.196 --> 00:12:53.696
Come on. Hurry! Get out of the way!

153
00:12:56.296 --> 00:12:57.496
Stop it!

154
00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:00.596
I called the police.

155
00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:03.096
So just put up with this a while longer. Please!

156
00:13:06.996 --> 00:13:08.396
Big sis.

157
00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:21.996
Silver hair?

158
00:13:21.996 --> 00:13:24.696
The story was meant to end this way.

159
00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:27.096
Hate God for what is happening to you.

160
00:13:38.196 --> 00:13:39.496
What are you doing?

161
00:13:39.496 --> 00:13:41.996
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

162
00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:44.996
Hurry or my arm will get slippery from the rain.

163
00:13:44.996 --> 00:13:47.196
Why'd you save me?

164
00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:49.096
Why on earth?

165
00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:54.696
Who needs a reason?

166
00:13:54.696 --> 00:13:56.396
Who cares what the motives are

167
00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.196
for a person to want to kill another person?

168
00:13:58.196 --> 00:14:00.396
Why would a person want to save another then?

169
00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:04.496
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

170
00:14:16.596 --> 00:14:18.096
Get out of the way!

171
00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:25.496
What are you doing?

172
00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:28.096
Hurry and hang on to my arm!

173
00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:33.196
Move it, Angel!

174
00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:41.896
What?

175
00:14:45.696 --> 00:14:48.996
This is a blind spot for the rifle.

176
00:14:48.996 --> 00:14:50.896
When did you...

177
00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:52.496
Throw your gun down.

178
00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:55.796
Throw your gun down!

179
00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:58.096
If not, I'll aim for your head next.

180
00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.096
The sound of a pump?

181
00:15:07.096 --> 00:15:08.396
A shotgun?

182
00:15:08.396 --> 00:15:10.796
Okay! Calvados.

183
00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:12.396
We'll attack them from both sides!

184
00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:17.396
This is bad.

185
00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:18.596
He's coming from behind.

186
00:15:35.696 --> 00:15:37.696
Come on, Calvados.

187
00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:40.596
Use that dear shotgun of yours

188
00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:43.896
and blow up the little kitty FBI agent, will you?

189
00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:49.696
So, his name is Calvados.

190
00:15:52.796 --> 00:15:55.896
A rifle, a shotgun and three guns.

191
00:15:58.196 --> 00:16:01.096
I thought he was a weapon vendor or something.

192
00:16:02.196 --> 00:16:04.096
Shuichi Akai?

193
00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.896
Shu!

194
00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:08.296
But with two broken legs,

195
00:16:08.296 --> 00:16:10.896
I don't think he'll be doing business for quite some time.

196
00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:21.396
Well, Calvados is like a strong apple spirit.

197
00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:22.796
So, I guess he's just right

198
00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:25.196
for the partner of a rotten apple like you.

199
00:16:25.196 --> 00:16:27.796
Rotten apple?

200
00:16:27.796 --> 00:16:30.396
That's the name we call you by.

201
00:16:30.396 --> 00:16:33.096
Golden Apple was the stage

202
00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:36.096
in which the great actress Sharon stole the limelight.

203
00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:39.396
You're just as beautiful now as you were back then but...

204
00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:43.296
Inside, you're a wrinkled up rotten apple.

205
00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:45.696
A really rotten apple!

206
00:16:59.796 --> 00:17:03.296
Don't, Shu!

207
00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:05.096
Don't worry.

208
00:17:05.096 --> 00:17:07.396
I can tell from the way she moves

209
00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:09.996
that she's wearing a bullet proof jacket

210
00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:12.396
and layers of bullet proof pads all over her body.

211
00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:14.896
I think she'll get two or three broken ribs at most.

212
00:17:15.996 --> 00:17:17.796
Moreover, look.

213
00:17:17.796 --> 00:17:20.396
Look at her face that tore apart with the shot that was fired.

214
00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:24.696
That's the face of that woman with no make-up after all.

215
00:17:33.596 --> 00:17:35.096
The brats are a nuisance!

216
00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.796
Cool kid.

217
00:18:27.096 --> 00:18:28.596
To think she can blow up the gasoline tank

218
00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:30.696
by looking over the mirror in that situation.

219
00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:40.096
She's pretty good.

220
00:18:40.096 --> 00:18:41.396
Shu!

221
00:18:41.396 --> 00:18:43.496
This is no time to be amazed by her!

222
00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:47.296
She took a child hostage and got away, you know?

223
00:18:47.296 --> 00:18:49.996
Then why didn't you take the key out of the car?

224
00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.896
Well, I'm sorry.

225
00:18:53.896 --> 00:18:55.696
We did get our share though,

226
00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:58.096
because that woman's comrade is...

227
00:19:00.796 --> 00:19:02.396
Hey...

228
00:19:02.396 --> 00:19:05.596
Don't tell me he still had a gun on him?

229
00:19:05.596 --> 00:19:07.496
Could it be that he killed himself?

230
00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:11.796
Look at that.

231
00:19:11.796 --> 00:19:14.296
The Japanese police are here.

232
00:19:16.796 --> 00:19:20.096
This girl must've called them.

233
00:19:20.096 --> 00:19:22.096
Inside the trunk,

234
00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:23.696
it's hard to make out conversation

235
00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:25.996
but bullets can be heard.

236
00:19:25.996 --> 00:19:27.096
I'm sure

237
00:19:27.096 --> 00:19:30.096
she saw the pictures in my room and got suspicious,

238
00:19:30.096 --> 00:19:32.096
and snuck inside my car

239
00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:33.996
in order to investigate me.

240
00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:38.996
She heard the bullets and came outside.

241
00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:43.796
Then protected the brown haired girl, who had a gun pointed at her.

242
00:19:43.796 --> 00:19:46.996
They probably thought they were shot

243
00:19:46.996 --> 00:19:50.296
and both passed out.

244
00:19:50.296 --> 00:19:51.996
Geez.

245
00:19:51.996 --> 00:19:55.296
I don't know if you can say they got guts or not.

246
00:19:55.296 --> 00:19:58.596
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you.

247
00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:00.196
Just go ahead and explain to them that

248
00:20:00.196 --> 00:20:01.996
you're an FBI agent on a long leave of absence came to Japan

249
00:20:01.996 --> 00:20:05.696
and got mixed up in a child kidnapping case.

250
00:20:07.496 --> 00:20:10.096
Since that woman got away,

251
00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:14.896
nobody would believe anything we say anyway.

252
00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:18.296
The big guy behind all this hasn't come up front yet.

253
00:20:18.296 --> 00:20:20.596
And besides I can't have

254
00:20:20.596 --> 00:20:25.296
that girl with the brown hair see me yet.

255
00:20:57.296 --> 00:21:00.296
"Seems that I gave you too much freedom before."

256
00:21:00.296 --> 00:21:03.396
"Return to me immediately, Vermouth."

257
00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:06.196
Okay, boss.

258
00:21:13.396 --> 00:21:14.396
Now...

259
00:21:14.396 --> 00:21:16.696
This child.

260
00:21:16.696 --> 00:21:18.296
What shall do with this child who thinks

261
00:21:18.296 --> 00:21:20.796
he is capable of doing everything?

262
00:21:39.396 --> 00:21:42.196
The electrodes of an ECG monitor?

263
00:21:43.696 --> 00:21:46.296
There is a tracing device as well as a recorder.

264
00:21:46.296 --> 00:21:47.696
Don't tell me that

265
00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:49.896
the sound of the telephone I made just a while ago was.

266
00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:52.596
Don't.

267
00:21:52.596 --> 00:21:54.396
If you pull that out,

268
00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:57.196
it means that my heart has stopped

269
00:21:57.196 --> 00:22:00.196
and the mail address of the boss you sent an e-mail to

270
00:22:00.196 --> 00:22:03.496
will be disclosed to my friend.

271
00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:07.096
The telephone company must protect the privacy of their clients.

272
00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:08.496
But the police

273
00:22:08.496 --> 00:22:11.996
can get that information if they fill out a special form

274
00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:14.396
and have one of the higher-ups put a seal on it,

275
00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:17.696
then have the information disclosed before several witnesses.

276
00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:20.596
If the call that was received was not from a cell phone,

277
00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:24.496
but a regular home phone, even the address would be disclosed!

278
00:22:24.496 --> 00:22:25.596
In other words,

279
00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:27.196
if the sound just now is recorded

280
00:22:27.196 --> 00:22:30.596
and analyzed to decipher the alphabets and number,

281
00:22:30.596 --> 00:22:35.096
the name of your boss, as well as his whereabouts can be tracked down!

282
00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:37.596
That is, even if I were to be killed!

283
00:22:37.596 --> 00:22:38.696
Well,

284
00:22:38.696 --> 00:22:41.696
I did figure that if you found Sherry,

285
00:22:41.696 --> 00:22:45.096
who you guys are going nuts looking for,

286
00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:49.196
you would unmistakably contact your big boss.

287
00:22:50.396 --> 00:22:53.296
Since things began to look dangerous for Ms. Jodie,

288
00:22:53.296 --> 00:22:55.996
I had to change my plans.

289
00:22:57.096 --> 00:22:59.496
So, what are you going to do now?

290
00:23:02.196 --> 00:23:03.996
My friends are waiting for contact from me

291
00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:06.896
at a distant place from here.

292
00:23:10.196 --> 00:23:12.396
If you don't want this to go out,

293
00:23:12.396 --> 00:23:14.596
take me to your boss!

294
00:23:14.596 --> 00:23:17.896
Let's get things over with once and for all, Vermouth!

295
00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:22.196
I want to stop playing hide-and-seek already!

296
00:23:27.196 --> 00:23:28.796
Okay.

297
00:23:28.796 --> 00:23:30.496
I lost.

298
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:32.896
I'll give up going after Sherry.

299
00:23:41.196 --> 00:23:43.396
It's mere sleeping gas.

300
00:23:43.396 --> 00:23:44.996
You idiot!

301
00:23:44.996 --> 00:23:47.396
If you do something like this, you'll suck in the gas too.

302
00:23:47.396 --> 00:23:50.696
Yes. This is a gamble.

303
00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:52.696
If you get up first,

304
00:23:52.696 --> 00:23:55.396
you go ahead and call the police and have me arrested,

305
00:23:55.396 --> 00:23:59.096
then go raid the boss along with them.

306
00:23:59.096 --> 00:24:02.196
You already know what happens

307
00:24:02.196 --> 00:24:03.896
if I get up first, don't you?

308
00:24:05.596 --> 00:24:07.296
Bad news!

309
00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:12.396
I've got to go wake him up right away.

310
00:24:12.396 --> 00:24:13.696
Shinichi!

311
00:24:18.696 --> 00:24:24.396
Shinichi...

312
00:25:52.596 --> 00:25:55.496
You guys were blasted by Shuichi Akai?

313
00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:57.496
Yes.

314
00:25:57.496 --> 00:25:59.296
He just happened to find us by,

315
00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:02.396
and Calvados ended up with three broken ribs.

316
00:26:02.396 --> 00:26:05.996
You mean that FBI agent that you failed to get rid of

317
00:26:05.996 --> 00:26:08.196
back in New York a year ago,

318
00:26:08.196 --> 00:26:12.196
when you disguised yourself as serial killer.

319
00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:13.896
I thought he'd be off his guard if he figured

320
00:26:13.896 --> 00:26:16.596
I was just an ordinary killer, but...

321
00:26:18.596 --> 00:26:21.496
I should've gotten rid of him back then

322
00:26:21.496 --> 00:26:23.996
even if I had to risk being killed myself.

323
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:43.996
Our boss said that

324
00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:46.596
that person

325
00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:50.696
could be our silver bullet.

326
00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:54.696
He is to be feared.

327
00:26:58.496 --> 00:27:02.696
A silver bullet that capable to kill us in one shot

328
00:27:02.696 --> 00:27:04.696
doesn't exist.

329
00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:08.396
At any rate, I'm in a phone booth on route 20,

330
00:27:08.396 --> 00:27:10.696
so can you come pick me up?

331
00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:14.096
I got into a bit of trouble,

332
00:27:14.096 --> 00:27:15.796
and can't move.

333
00:27:15.796 --> 00:27:19.396
Before that, I have something I want to ask you.

334
00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:24.696
Do you know a kid by the name of Shinichi Kudo?

335
00:27:28.296 --> 00:27:29.696
No.

336
00:27:29.696 --> 00:27:31.396
I don't.

337
00:27:31.396 --> 00:27:33.696
Why did you save me?

338
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:37.896
Who needs a reason?

339
00:27:37.896 --> 00:27:40.196
Why would a person want to save another then?

340
00:27:40.196 --> 00:27:43.696
There is no logical reason for that either, is there?

341
00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:49.196
Yes, it's him.

342
00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:58.096
He, the one who pierced through our heart,

343
00:27:58.096 --> 00:27:59.896
could prove to be him.

344
00:28:10.596 --> 00:28:13.596
The one that we have long awaited,

345
00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:15.596
the silver bullet.

346
00:28:20.796 --> 00:28:23.296
"Next Episode"

347
00:28:23.296 --> 00:28:25.096
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

348
00:28:25.096 --> 00:28:28.696
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

349
00:28:28.696 --> 00:28:29.896
Hey!

350
00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:34.896
The mark on Genta's butt sure looks familiar.

351
00:28:45.296 --> 00:28:46.596
Next Conan,
