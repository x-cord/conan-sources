1
00:00:02.724 --> 00:00:05.724
Ai, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

2
00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:09.924
and I came to the campsite on Dr. Agasa's Beetle.

3
00:00:09.924 --> 00:00:11.724
Doc and I separated with the members of the detective squad

4
00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.524
to go and shop for the canteens that Doc forgot to bring.

5
00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:16.924
We coincidentally run into Masumi Sera.

6
00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:19.924
She decides to join us at the campsite.

7
00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:24.124
On the other hand, Ai and the members of the detective squad

8
00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.024
who go into the forest to pick firewood.

9
00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:30.424
There, they run into a man who is burying the dead body of a woman!

10
00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:32.724
A woman...

11
00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.824
Is being buried.

12
00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:37.524
Run!

13
00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:39.324
Ai and the children flee desperately

14
00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:41.524
unable to get though to me.

15
00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.424
They decide to hide in a mountain cabin in the forest.

16
00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:48.224
How about it, Mitsuhiko?

17
00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:51.824
There seems to be no other entrance. That's the only one.

18
00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.924
Hey, what's the matter?

19
00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.024
I'm fine.

20
00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.924
The floor was just wet.

21
00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:08.424
It can't be...

22
00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:11.624
The woman a while ago was...

23
00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:15.624
If so, 9 out of 10 he'll come back here

24
00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:18.524
to this blood smeared site of the crime.

25
00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:20.824
The culprit...

26
00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.424
Then, we'll have to hurry out of here.

27
00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:24.824
True!

28
00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:27.824
At that time, we joined Inspector Yamamura and the others

29
00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:30.024
who had come to the site after being contacted by Ai.

30
00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:31.724
The three suspects thought

31
00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.824
to have been burying the corpse were also found.

32
00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:36.324
Big trouble!

33
00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:40.424
The door's chained and we can't get out!

34
00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:43.724
Ai! We've been locked in!

35
00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:48.924
Ai. Doesn't it smell like something's burning?

36
00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:51.024
Come to think of it, yes.

37
00:01:52.824 --> 00:01:54.224
It can't be...

38
00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:57.024
Isn't this mountain cabin burning?

39
00:01:57.024 --> 00:01:58.424
We've got to hurry and flee!

40
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:01.824
Darn it! This door won't budge!

41
00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:05.524
What shall we do? We don't have the strength.

42
00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.524
We'll be fine, calm down!

43
00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:11.824
I'm sure someone will notice the smoke

44
00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:14.024
and come to rescue us.

45
00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:15.724
That' right.

46
00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:17.224
Conan.

47
00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:23.924
Smoke?

48
00:02:23.924 --> 00:02:27.524
Hey, it's some distance away but there's smoke rising!

49
00:02:29.324 --> 00:02:32.524
That's probably the smoke from a camp fire.

50
00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:34.624
See, there's another one over there, too.

51
00:02:34.624 --> 00:02:37.324
For some reason recently, a lot of young kids

52
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:41.424
make large bonfires from noon and really live it up.

53
00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:43.824
Inspector Yamamura!

54
00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:45.824
Regarding the report we got earlier,

55
00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:48.724
I brought the three men.

56
00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:51.424
Is that right? Good work!

57
00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:15.524
Aim for a 100% solution.

58
00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:17.724
Clear all mysteries and codes.

59
00:03:17.724 --> 00:03:19.424
A dark shadow that closes in on Ai.

60
00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:21.524
A small mistake that was left behind.

61
00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:23.024
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:24.924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:03:24.924 --> 00:03:27.324
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:05:11.804 --> 00:05:17.604
"Shadow Closes on Ai's Secret (Part 2)"

65
00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:20.904
Then, will you all one by one give me your names, occupation

66
00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:24.304
and the reason you came here.

67
00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:28.304
I'm Hayamichi Yonezumi, a free-lancer.

68
00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:30.704
I don't know what happened,

69
00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:33.804
but since I'm coming here next week with my friends,

70
00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:35.204
I came to check this place out!

71
00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:38.104
My name is Chozo Usagi.

72
00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.704
I'm a photographer.

73
00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:43.704
I take pictures of campsites throughout Japan.

74
00:05:43.704 --> 00:05:46.704
I also came to take pictures.

75
00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:48.504
I wanted to take pictures of Japanese azalea

76
00:05:48.504 --> 00:05:50.604
on my cell phone camera to upload on my blog

77
00:05:50.604 --> 00:05:54.004
because they bloom orange flowers during this season.

78
00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.404
My name is Takeya Iwakuma.

79
00:05:56.404 --> 00:05:58.504
I'm a senior at Beika University.

80
00:05:58.504 --> 00:06:02.404
But you're all dressed very lightly.

81
00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:04.704
I just came to check the place out, you know.

82
00:06:04.704 --> 00:06:06.904
Same with me.

83
00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:10.004
My camera and equipment are in my car.

84
00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:13.304
I just dropped by.

85
00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:15.704
How is it?

86
00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:18.004
I can't get through yet.

87
00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:20.304
I'm sure that Ai would move to a place

88
00:06:20.304 --> 00:06:23.104
where the cell phone will work.

89
00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:25.304
If they're still being pursued by the culprit

90
00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.404
and she can't make the call because of it,

91
00:06:27.404 --> 00:06:30.904
then maybe the culprit's not among the three?

92
00:06:30.904 --> 00:06:34.104
Or I don't want to think this,

93
00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:36.904
but maybe they've already been killed by someone

94
00:06:36.904 --> 00:06:39.404
including those three.

95
00:06:39.404 --> 00:06:41.304
Or they may be in a situation

96
00:06:41.304 --> 00:06:44.004
where that can't move for some reason.

97
00:06:50.304 --> 00:06:52.204
Everybody, get a hold of yourself!

98
00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:55.004
Keep your heads down low to avoid inhaling smoke!

99
00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:57.604
I'm sure that help is on the way!

100
00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:02.504
But I wonder when they'll come?

101
00:07:02.504 --> 00:07:05.304
There's smoke over on the other side, too.

102
00:07:05.304 --> 00:07:07.204
I wonder if it's a camp fire?

103
00:07:07.204 --> 00:07:08.404
No!

104
00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:12.304
Then maybe they won't notice our smoke?

105
00:07:12.304 --> 00:07:14.204
Oh, no.

106
00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:17.504
I've got no choice than... but to...

107
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.504
All three of them wear size 26 (cm)?

108
00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:24.804
-Really? -Yeah.

109
00:07:24.804 --> 00:07:26.504
My shoe size, right?

110
00:07:26.504 --> 00:07:28.604
What about it?

111
00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:32.404
Darn it. If the culprit is among those three,

112
00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:33.704
the sooner the better to find out who he is,

113
00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.604
so that we can get info on where everyone is.

114
00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:37.504
That's the fastest way.

115
00:07:37.504 --> 00:07:39.304
How troubling.

116
00:07:39.304 --> 00:07:43.404
The detective badges of the children were all in the tent.

117
00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:46.904
I think we should go to search, too.

118
00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:48.704
Going in search randomly

119
00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:50.204
will just get us lost in the forest!

120
00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:52.204
I think we should let the search team

121
00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:55.004
who know about the mountains do their job.

122
00:07:55.004 --> 00:07:58.004
But the sun's starting to set

123
00:07:58.004 --> 00:08:00.304
and our shadows are getting longer, too.

124
00:08:00.304 --> 00:08:03.104
We've got to find them before it gets dark.

125
00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:04.704
-Shadow? -Shadow?

126
00:08:07.704 --> 00:08:09.504
I see.

127
00:08:09.504 --> 00:08:11.304
So, that's the story.

128
00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:20.104
Ayumi?

129
00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:22.204
Get a hold of yourself! Ayumi!

130
00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:24.604
Ayumi! Get up, Ayumi!

131
00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:28.004
Genta! Let's take Ayumi closer to the door!

132
00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:29.804
We've got to make her breathe the air outside!

133
00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:32.604
I see! Get a hold of yourself, Ayumi!

134
00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:33.704
We're going to move you!

135
00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:36.604
I'll let you breathe delicious air right now!

136
00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:39.204
Here, it's air from outside! Ayumi!

137
00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.504
It's good, isn't it? Right, Ayumi?

138
00:08:41.504 --> 00:08:43.804
Get a hold of yourself, Ayumi!

139
00:08:43.804 --> 00:08:46.604
Ayumi! Get up, Ayumi!

140
00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:48.104
Ayumi!

141
00:08:50.604 --> 00:08:52.904
What was that sound?

142
00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:54.504
It looks like the door opened.

143
00:08:54.504 --> 00:08:57.704
It can't be. We're the only ones here.

144
00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:02.004
Don't tell me that the culprit came back.

145
00:09:45.954 --> 00:09:47.954
Hey, officer.

146
00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:51.254
Isn't it about time you tell us what's going on?

147
00:09:51.254 --> 00:09:54.154
You've got to tell us

148
00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:56.754
or I can't cooperate anymore.

149
00:09:56.754 --> 00:10:00.454
I've got things to do after this too, you see.

150
00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:01.854
The thing is,

151
00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:05.554
the body of a woman was found dumped in the mountain.

152
00:10:05.554 --> 00:10:08.554
The culprit is still on the run.

153
00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:09.954
-What? -What?

154
00:10:09.954 --> 00:10:11.754
That's why we had you,

155
00:10:11.754 --> 00:10:15.354
who were walking alone in the mountains come here.

156
00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:18.354
Hey, hey.

157
00:10:18.354 --> 00:10:21.154
Will all three of you show me both hands?

158
00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:22.954
-Huh? -Why?

159
00:10:22.954 --> 00:10:25.254
Because I was watching all this time,

160
00:10:25.254 --> 00:10:28.254
but Mr. Yonezumi and Iwakuma used only your left hands.

161
00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:31.254
But, Mr. Usami, you used only your right hand!

162
00:10:31.254 --> 00:10:34.154
I just thought that maybe you have a scar on the other hand

163
00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:36.454
and is hiding it!

164
00:10:36.454 --> 00:10:37.654
Geez.

165
00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:41.554
I was using my left hand because I'm left handed.

166
00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:43.954
See? My right hand has no scar, does it?

167
00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:47.154
Same here. I'm a lefty.

168
00:10:47.154 --> 00:10:50.954
I used only my right hand because I'm right handed.

169
00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:54.354
Of course there's nothing on my left hand, too.

170
00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.654
But, Mr. Usagi...

171
00:10:57.654 --> 00:10:59.854
The culprit was also right handed!

172
00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:01.254
Huh?

173
00:11:01.254 --> 00:11:03.054
What're you talking about?

174
00:11:03.054 --> 00:11:04.854
All you saw was the woman

175
00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:08.354
that the culprit was trying to bury and the hole, right?

176
00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:11.554
It was left near the corpse and the hole.

177
00:11:11.554 --> 00:11:15.054
The evidence that the culprit was right-handed!

178
00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:16.254
Evidence?

179
00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:18.854
The scar on the victim was slashed from the top right to the bottom

180
00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:21.454
with something like an axe.

181
00:11:21.454 --> 00:11:23.254
Which means that

182
00:11:23.254 --> 00:11:26.554
the culprit who slashed her was probably right-handed.

183
00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:28.854
The footprints of the culprit around the hole,

184
00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.654
showed that the left foot was in front and the right behind.

185
00:11:31.654 --> 00:11:33.554
Such footprints can't be left behind

186
00:11:33.554 --> 00:11:35.854
unless a right-handed person digs the hole, right?

187
00:11:39.154 --> 00:11:40.454
That's true.

188
00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:44.354
What? Then, what? Is he the culprit?

189
00:11:44.354 --> 00:11:48.354
What? Come on, give me a break.

190
00:11:48.354 --> 00:11:51.554
If you have anything to say, say it now.

191
00:11:51.554 --> 00:11:55.454
I mean, there are loads of right-handers around!

192
00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:57.954
These two may actually be right-handers that are hiding it

193
00:11:57.954 --> 00:12:02.154
and forcing themselves to use their left.

194
00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:04.654
I wonder about that.

195
00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:06.054
Besides, see...

196
00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:09.854
The culprit may still be hiding in the mountains somewhere.

197
00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:13.454
It's true that most Japanese are right-handed,

198
00:12:13.454 --> 00:12:15.854
but the only one who, at around the time of the crime,

199
00:12:15.854 --> 00:12:17.254
was wandering around this mountain,

200
00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:22.954
and called Usami, who is right-handed is you.

201
00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:24.154
What?

202
00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:27.254
Come on, Conan.

203
00:12:27.254 --> 00:12:29.654
Where at the site was there such a name?

204
00:12:29.654 --> 00:12:33.054
The woman victim taught us, didn't she?

205
00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:35.454
Inside the sleeping bag she was put in...

206
00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:38.554
She made this shape with her fingers and told us.

207
00:12:38.554 --> 00:12:41.254
What of that becomes the name Usagi?

208
00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:44.354
It's hard to tell just from the shape made by her fingers,

209
00:12:44.354 --> 00:12:47.654
but if you place the right and left hand on top of each other...

210
00:12:49.054 --> 00:12:50.954
And shine a light on it...

211
00:12:52.654 --> 00:12:56.054
That's maybe...

212
00:12:56.054 --> 00:12:59.454
A rabbit!

213
00:12:59.454 --> 00:13:01.754
But why is it shadow drawing?

214
00:13:01.754 --> 00:13:03.354
If she made this shape with her fingers,

215
00:13:03.354 --> 00:13:05.654
she could've written words with blood, no?

216
00:13:05.654 --> 00:13:07.354
It's because the woman who was killed

217
00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:09.954
was a nursery school teacher!

218
00:13:09.954 --> 00:13:11.254
Because job-wise

219
00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:14.454
they probably show shadow pictures to children.

220
00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:16.454
Even if the culprit were to find it,

221
00:13:16.454 --> 00:13:19.054
it at first doesn't look like a rabbit.

222
00:13:19.054 --> 00:13:20.954
Her hands probably loosened up

223
00:13:20.954 --> 00:13:23.954
when she was being carried around.

224
00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:28.654
Well, it's no use trying to play dumb!

225
00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:31.254
Being that you inflicted such a wound on the victim's back,

226
00:13:31.254 --> 00:13:34.254
you would've had a lot of her blood splattered on yourself.

227
00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:37.654
It seems you changed and washed yourself off with water,

228
00:13:37.654 --> 00:13:41.254
you can't erase it that easily.

229
00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:45.854
The luminol reaction that detects blood on the body.

230
00:13:45.854 --> 00:13:48.854
Then, we should've taken the three to begin,

231
00:13:48.854 --> 00:13:50.954
to the station and investigate them.

232
00:13:50.954 --> 00:13:52.654
That would've taken too much time,

233
00:13:52.654 --> 00:13:54.854
and looking for the children would've been delayed, right?

234
00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:56.754
I see.

235
00:13:56.754 --> 00:13:58.354
You're the one, aren't you?

236
00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:01.354
That was seen by my friends when you were burying the body

237
00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:03.154
and later chased them around?

238
00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:05.754
I... It's not me.

239
00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:08.954
Huh? You're still going to keep it up?

240
00:14:08.954 --> 00:14:11.154
I... I'm not the one to blame.

241
00:14:11.154 --> 00:14:12.654
It's her!

242
00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:16.554
She had the nerve to confine me in a place like that to tease me.

243
00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:19.354
She's to blame!

244
00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:23.354
I loved her and yet...

245
00:14:25.354 --> 00:14:28.154
We were planning to get married, too.

246
00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:31.154
Why'd she do something like that?

247
00:14:33.954 --> 00:14:38.154
She confined you.

248
00:14:38.154 --> 00:14:41.454
I'm claustrophobic.

249
00:14:42.454 --> 00:14:43.854
Three year ago,

250
00:14:43.854 --> 00:14:46.454
I once was locked into an elevator the whole day through

251
00:14:46.454 --> 00:14:48.554
because of an accident.

252
00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:53.754
Ever since then, I panic whenever I'm in a dark closed place.

253
00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:59.354
Yet, she tried to confine me!

254
00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:02.354
In the dark mountain, cabin where not even the windows open.

255
00:15:06.754 --> 00:15:11.354
Then, the one who wanted to come here was the victim?

256
00:15:11.354 --> 00:15:15.754
Yes. I naturally panicked

257
00:15:15.754 --> 00:15:18.354
and tried desperately to escape,

258
00:15:18.354 --> 00:15:21.354
but the axe in the cabin that I flung around in the dark

259
00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:24.354
accidentally slashed her back.

260
00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:25.854
That's right.

261
00:15:25.854 --> 00:15:28.554
Only if she didn't do that,

262
00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:30.854
I wouldn't have locked the children in either.

263
00:15:33.054 --> 00:15:35.654
You locked them in the cabin?

264
00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:36.954
Yeah.

265
00:15:36.954 --> 00:15:40.954
But I think it's too late already.

266
00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:42.054
Don't tell me that

267
00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:43.854
he locked them in the mountain cabin and set fire to it?

268
00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:45.654
Inspector Yamamura!

269
00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:46.654
We got a report from the search team

270
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.354
saying that they found a mountain cabin on fire.

271
00:15:49.354 --> 00:15:51.554
And was it extinguished?

272
00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:55.754
It seems that when found the cabin was burning out of control.

273
00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.154
Hey. You folks!

274
00:16:08.954 --> 00:16:11.954
No. It can't be...

275
00:16:14.354 --> 00:16:15.554
Darn it!

276
00:16:15.554 --> 00:16:17.354
No, no! Don't go near it!

277
00:16:17.354 --> 00:16:20.854
Let me go! My friends... my friends are inside!

278
00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:22.954
-What? -Let me go!

279
00:16:22.954 --> 00:16:25.454
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

280
00:16:25.454 --> 00:16:28.454
Ai! Ayumi!

281
00:16:37.154 --> 00:16:38.654
Yes!

282
00:16:38.654 --> 00:16:41.854
Conan! Over here!

283
00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:46.354
We're okay, too!

284
00:16:46.354 --> 00:16:48.154
You guys...

285
00:16:48.154 --> 00:16:49.754
How on earth did you...

286
00:16:49.754 --> 00:16:53.654
A strange lady suddenly appeared and saved us.

287
00:16:53.654 --> 00:16:56.054
She broke the door open with the axe!

288
00:16:56.054 --> 00:17:00.254
It seems she was living in the attic of the cabin.

289
00:17:00.254 --> 00:17:02.054
Where's Ai?

290
00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:05.254
As for Ai, she was the first to be saved,

291
00:17:05.254 --> 00:17:08.054
and was told to escape to a safe place.

292
00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:11.354
I got a call from Ai a while ago,

293
00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.854
so we know she's safe.

294
00:17:13.854 --> 00:17:15.154
That girl...

295
00:17:15.154 --> 00:17:17.254
Don't tell me that she used the antidote.

296
00:17:17.254 --> 00:17:19.654
Which way did that lady go?

297
00:17:19.654 --> 00:17:22.754
She told us to hide until you and the others came

298
00:17:22.754 --> 00:17:23.954
and went over that way.

299
00:17:23.954 --> 00:17:25.954
You guys wait there!

300
00:17:27.654 --> 00:17:33.054
I'd like to interrogate the children, too.

301
00:17:33.054 --> 00:17:36.254
But they may have inhaled smoke,

302
00:17:36.254 --> 00:17:38.754
so we'll have to get a doctor to examine them.

303
00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:41.754
Then, please bring them over to the station after that.

304
00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:43.354
Hey, you guys!

305
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:46.854
Do you remember what the lady was like?

306
00:17:46.854 --> 00:17:48.654
She was pretty.

307
00:17:48.654 --> 00:17:51.054
She looked a bit like Ai, right?

308
00:17:51.054 --> 00:17:54.954
That's why I sent the movie that I secretly took!

309
00:17:54.954 --> 00:17:56.954
You sent a movie?

310
00:17:56.954 --> 00:17:58.354
Yes.

311
00:17:58.354 --> 00:18:01.254
I wanted to thank her later,

312
00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:02.954
so I sent it to the Mouri Detective Agency,

313
00:18:02.954 --> 00:18:05.254
to have them find her.

314
00:18:05.254 --> 00:18:09.254
I promised to send them pictures of the camp to begin with, anyway.

315
00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:12.454
See, this is her!

316
00:18:12.454 --> 00:18:14.154
But we may be able to see her next week

317
00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:15.954
even if we don't look for her.

318
00:18:15.954 --> 00:18:18.454
Because she...

319
00:18:18.454 --> 00:18:21.454
Ai! Where are you?

320
00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:22.754
Ai!

321
00:18:27.054 --> 00:18:28.454
You're late.

322
00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:30.654
I believed that "you know who"

323
00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:33.654
was going to come to rescue us and yet...

324
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:36.554
I didn't think that I would end up having to drink that antidote

325
00:18:36.554 --> 00:18:39.654
to return to my former size.

326
00:18:39.654 --> 00:18:42.454
Where'd you get those clothes?

327
00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.954
I borrowed the clothes

328
00:18:43.954 --> 00:18:47.354
that I found in the cabin of the woman that killed!

329
00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:51.654
I couldn't go out in front of the children stark naked.

330
00:18:51.654 --> 00:18:54.454
Well, but since my body grew,

331
00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:56.654
I couldn't remove this ring.

332
00:18:56.654 --> 00:18:59.054
As for the clothes, I got to change everything.

333
00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:04.854
I hope the children haven't noticed that I'm Ai Haibara.

334
00:19:04.854 --> 00:19:07.554
Okay then, why don't you hide in the tent

335
00:19:07.554 --> 00:19:10.054
until the drug wears off?

336
00:19:10.054 --> 00:19:12.854
They're going to be interrogated.

337
00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:17.154
By the way, you did catch the murderer?

338
00:19:17.154 --> 00:19:20.554
Yes. It was the photographer.

339
00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:23.854
I realized it when I saw her dying message.

340
00:19:23.854 --> 00:19:25.754
He's claustrophobic,

341
00:19:25.754 --> 00:19:29.554
and he said he was almost locked up in the cabin.

342
00:19:29.554 --> 00:19:33.554
I get it. It matches.

343
00:19:33.554 --> 00:19:36.654
In her bag with her clothes,

344
00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:39.954
there was a book about claustrophobia.

345
00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:42.754
She was trying help him overcome the phobia

346
00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:44.654
by taking him into that cabin,

347
00:19:44.654 --> 00:19:47.054
and staying with him throughout the night.

348
00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:49.954
But that kind of drastic measure backfired.

349
00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:52.054
He panicked,

350
00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:54.854
and unfortunately she was murdered.

351
00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:57.854
What a story about an unwanted noble gesture.

352
00:19:57.854 --> 00:20:02.454
That type of phobia doesn't have to be cured to lead a normal life.

353
00:20:02.454 --> 00:20:06.054
It might have been because he was a photographer.

354
00:20:06.054 --> 00:20:09.954
If he was using a film type camera

355
00:20:09.954 --> 00:20:12.954
and if he can't handle being in a small dark room,

356
00:20:12.954 --> 00:20:16.054
for a photographer that could ruin him.

357
00:20:16.054 --> 00:20:19.354
She probably wanted him to be his old self again.

358
00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:24.454
Didn't she leave evidence that he was the killer?

359
00:20:24.454 --> 00:20:26.354
She was holding a grudge against him.

360
00:20:26.354 --> 00:20:27.554
No.

361
00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:31.354
If that's so, it wasn't her dying message.

362
00:20:31.354 --> 00:20:35.754
Maybe she just wanted to die hugging it.

363
00:20:35.754 --> 00:20:39.754
A rabbit, the form of the person she loved the most.

364
00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:11.454
So, those kids are staying at an Inn in Gunma tonight?

365
00:22:11.454 --> 00:22:15.054
Yep, the camp grounds are still scary.

366
00:22:15.054 --> 00:22:18.454
By the way, they sure get involved in many cases.

367
00:22:18.454 --> 00:22:20.654
Hey? Just now, something...

368
00:22:20.654 --> 00:22:22.654
It sounded like a sound came from downstairs.

369
00:22:22.654 --> 00:22:24.454
It's the wind, the wind!

370
00:22:24.454 --> 00:22:26.154
It was pretty strong today.

371
00:22:30.454 --> 00:22:32.954
Password...

372
00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:36.054
How are both of your passwords?

373
00:22:36.054 --> 00:22:38.554
My birthday.

374
00:22:38.554 --> 00:22:42.154
Mine's "KOGOROSAN", 5563.

375
00:22:42.154 --> 00:22:44.954
I meant...

376
00:22:44.954 --> 00:22:47.854
if it's a very long password and you couldn't memorize it...

377
00:22:47.854 --> 00:22:50.354
5563...

378
00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:55.454
What was received weren't pictures... a movie?

379
00:23:03.954 --> 00:23:07.254
All right now. Until your friends arrive,

380
00:23:07.254 --> 00:23:09.254
keep quiet and out of sight.

381
00:23:16.054 --> 00:23:18.854
Mystery Train pass ring...

382
00:23:20.054 --> 00:23:22.054
Bell Tree Express.

383
00:23:25.354 --> 00:23:27.954
I'm being hacked.

384
00:23:27.954 --> 00:23:29.354
Who is it?

385
00:23:52.054 --> 00:23:53.954
"Next Episode"

386
00:23:53.954 --> 00:23:55.054
Congratulations!

387
00:23:55.054 --> 00:23:58.154
You've been chosen to play the role of the detective.

388
00:23:58.154 --> 00:24:01.754
I'll bet all the passengers are detectives.

389
00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:02.954
Excuse me.

390
00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:04.454
Idiot! Don't come in!

391
00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:05.554
Huh?

392
00:24:10.254 --> 00:24:12.354
We've met for the first time, right?

393
00:24:12.354 --> 00:24:14.954
She is...

394
00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.554
Don't tell me...

395
00:24:16.554 --> 00:24:22.054
Next Conan, "Pitch Black Express Mystery Train (Departure)"
