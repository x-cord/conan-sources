1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,340
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,940
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,840
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,740
A ghostly, a pocket bell, stamps and a music box.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,640
Seemingly separate mysteries come to a singular end.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,099
A young woman named Haruna Yuki

10
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,799
asks us to locate her pocket bell friend

11
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,599
who she hasn't been able to contact

12
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,899
because she wants to return his music box

13
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:06,199
but when we arrive at her friend Shugo Ogata's home,

14
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,799
we learn that he is dead.

15
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,299
Later that night,

16
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,199
Ran sees the suspicious shadow of an old man

17
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,199
walk down the corridor

18
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,399
and Shogo's grandson Minoru, has been attacked by someone.

19
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,999
And then, Haruna gets a mysterious message

20
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,199
on her pocket bell.

21
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,399
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"

22
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:33,399
"The Entrusted Music Box (Part 2)"

23
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:37,399
You didn't find any evidence of a break-in?

24
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,599
That's right.

25
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,699
The rain has made the ground pretty soft

26
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,599
but there're no footprints out there.

27
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,299
And even someone got in before the rain,

28
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,799
there should be footprints leaving the place.

29
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,199
But we didn't find anyone suspicious inside.

30
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,399
The only thing we were concerned about

31
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,599
was the unlocked back door, right?

32
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
-Yes. -The back door?

33
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,899
Oh, the lock on that door is broken,

34
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:04,699
it opens even when the wind blows.

35
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,999
That does bother me.

36
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,199
Then why don't you take a look yourself?

37
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,599
Even if someone did get in through that door,

38
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
don't you think there should be some footprints on the ground?

39
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,799
It's so muddy.

40
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,199
That's true. There're no footprints.

41
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,299
If there were, then maybe we could believe that story Ran told us

42
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,499
about seeing the shadow of an old man.

43
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,499
I told you, it wasn't my imagination.

44
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,099
Oh, no.

45
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,499
Would you mind moving your patrol car a bit?

46
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,499
Yes, right away. I'm terribly sorry.

47
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,399
First, let's go over all the details one more time,

48
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,399
then we'll check out the house.

49
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,799
-All right. -Young lady,

50
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,299
where did you see the suspicious shadow?

51
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,399
Uh, right here.

52
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,899
In this corridor. The old man with the cane was here

53
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,499
then he disappeared back there.

54
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,699
Then he must have hidden in that room at the far end.

55
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,099
No, I was in that room and I would have noticed.

56
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,699
But I saw it.

57
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,699
I saw his shadow through the screen door in this room.

58
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,999
And I saw it too.

59
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,999
Hey, whose room is this?

60
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,799
Oh, that room's my wife and mine.

61
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,899
When the girls saw the shadow,

62
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,799
were you and your wife in this room?

63
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:35,299
No. My wife and I were in the kitchen with our son Shiro.

64
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:39,599
-Eh? -Did you find the intruder?

65
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,399
No, I mean, 'ouch'.

66
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,399
I stepped on this hair pin that was on the floor.

67
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,599
Did you say hair pin?

68
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,699
Brat!

69
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,299
How many times have I told you not to get in my way?

70
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:55,299
Let me continue.

71
00:04:55,299 --> 00:05:00,399
Was your son that got hurt also with you in the kitchen?

72
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,299
No, we all thought he was taking a bath though.

73
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:07,099
And could you tell me what you three were doing in the kitchen?

74
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,799
Shiro was giving us a scolding,

75
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,099
he said we were being very rude to Haruna,

76
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,799
bombarding her with so many questions

77
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:15,499
after she was kind enough to come all the way to visit us.

78
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,499
What kind of questions?

79
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,099
Well, the truth is,

80
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,199
Shugo, the head of this household and I

81
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,499
were bell friends

82
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,999
and they wanted to know what we talked about and such.

83
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,999
That's right.

84
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,399
The three of them, included Minoru,

85
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,399
were practically interrogating her like some kind of criminal.

86
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,999
Oh, but it didn't bother me at all.

87
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,499
I talked about how Shogo's interest in stamps

88
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,699
got me to collect them too

89
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,999
and I got to reminisce about a lot of good things.

90
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,299
I even asked if I could come back,

91
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:48,399
so I wasn't bothered in the least.

92
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,799
Speaking of stamps, Minoru did mention something

93
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:55,099
about hand carved stamps worth 200 million.

94
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,399
Where is he now?

95
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,899
Perhaps those stamps

96
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,199
have something to do with what happened tonight.

97
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,299
I think Minoru's in his room next door.

98
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,599
They disappeared?

99
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,799
Yes, that's right.

100
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,499
Grandfather had a great collection

101
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:15,099
but those hand carved stamps were by far the most impressive.

102
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,199
We counted on the money it'd bring when we sold it

103
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,199
so we started buy all sorts of things.

104
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,299
You said we?

105
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:23,899
Yes, mom and dad agreed on it.

106
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,299
Hey, listen.

107
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:32,099
-What is it? -Is your room next door?

108
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,699
Yes, it is, why?

109
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,399
Okay then.

110
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,399
And whose room is on the other side?

111
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,699
That's grandpa and grandma's room.

112
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,899
Then maybe...

113
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,299
Hey, kid?

114
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,999
I knew it.

115
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,899
This is the room Minoru got attacked in.

116
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,199
Which means...

117
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,299
the room's layout is like this.

118
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:59,599
I think I know how it worked now, I've figured out the trick.

119
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
Now to figure out whose shadow Ran saw

120
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,699
and why the music box Shugo gave Haruna is off tune.

121
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,199
I wrote down the notes to the song

122
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,299
listening to another music box

123
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,699
but I don't really know what is what.

124
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,699
That's the music for that song, Haru yo Koi.

125
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,399
-How did you get it? -I...

126
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,499
it just happened to be part of my homework for music class.

127
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,699
Let me see that. I'll rewrite it so it's right.

128
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,099
Hey, give it back.

129
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,899
Let's see.

130
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,699
Geez...

131
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,799
Ran.

132
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,899
Huh? What is it?

133
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,499
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.

134
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,799
Here, I think that's right.

135
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,199
She's good as I suspected.

136
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,599
Hey, Ran.

137
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,999
What are these three # (sharps) for?

138
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,799
Oh, that stands for A major.

139
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:09,799
A major? That's it!

140
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,099
If anything comes up, feel free to call us anytime.

141
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,499
Thanks.

142
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,699
We still don't know whether it was a thief or a ghost.

143
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,799
-Yes. -Excuse me.

144
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,999
Has anyone seen Conan?

145
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:34,499
This is so simple.

146
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:37,299
I've got it now. I've figured everything out.

147
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,299
I know the identity of the ghost in the house

148
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,599
and who sent the mysterious message on the pocket bell

149
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,299
and I know what that off tune music box means

150
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,199
and Shugo,

151
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:53,599
I know where you hid those precious stamps of yours.

152
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,099
Now all I've got to do is,

153
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,199
put Uncle Kogoro to sleep as usual and...

154
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,899
Ouch...

155
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,099
Listen, you.

156
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,499
How many times have I told you not to go wandering off?

157
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,699
Ouch.

158
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,399
Come on, we're going home.

159
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,299
Going home?

160
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:10,599
But I just found something interesting.

161
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,699
There, look at that.

162
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,599
See what? What're you talking about?

163
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,599
Move a little to the right.

164
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,299
To the right?

165
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,399
Dad?

166
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,099
I see, so that's how it worked.

167
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:42,499
Ran, tell everyone to come here.

168
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,599
Yes.

169
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,799
Wait, before you do, get me some black paper,

170
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,099
a pair of scissors and some cellophane tape.

171
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,299
Where is he?

172
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:55,399
You found the thief, didn't you?

173
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,799
Thief? There wasn't a thief in the first place.

174
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,999
You're not going to tell us it was father's ghost, are you?

175
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,999
Of course not, that also never existed.

176
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,399
All the strange things that happened tonight

177
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,799
were orchestrated by one of you.

178
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,399
What?

179
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,599
But then ghostly things have happened before tonight too.

180
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,799
Before tonight?

181
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,299
Yes, I'm talking about the time

182
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:27,099
Haruna got the music box from Shugo.

183
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,199
Yes, she told us that story many times.

184
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,099
It's about the time gramps gave her the music box

185
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,799
without telling us about it, 2 Christmases ago.

186
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,599
Uh, no. He gave me the music box last Christmas.

187
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,999
That's impossible. Dad died last year on December 6th.

188
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,599
That can't be?

189
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:51,699
And on top of that, father had been hospitalized since that spring

190
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,699
and was in no condition to move around.

191
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:59,099
-Hey, what's going on around here? -It's very simple.

192
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,299
Someone pretended to be Shugo

193
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,299
and left the package containing the music box at Haruna's feet

194
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,499
while she waited for him in front of the Hachiko statue, that's all.

195
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:08,699
Isn't that right?

196
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,399
Shiro?

197
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,499
Shiro did it?

198
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,299
Is that true?

199
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,899
Hey, Shiro.

200
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,699
He asked me to.

201
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,599
Grandpa asked me to.

202
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,399
He said, 'even after I'm hospitalized,

203
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,999
I want you look after this girl'.

204
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,799
She reminds me of your grandmother and she's very lonely.

205
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,099
Do you mean, you've been sending me messages since last spring?

206
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,599
Yes. I've been communicating with you

207
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,799
on my grandfather's behalf.

208
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,599
Actually, I intended to tell you the truth

209
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:43,599
when I saw you that Christmas, but...

210
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,999
When I saw you standing there, with that red muffler around your neck,

211
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,399
you looked so excited and happy,

212
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,899
that's why I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

213
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,899
But, how did you know it was me?

214
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,699
I knew from the start that it was you

215
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:00,599
who gave Haruna the music box.

216
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:04,099
I knew it the moment you came to meet us at the front door.

217
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,199
I don't believe you.

218
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:09,899
When you saw Haruna, you put your hand on her shoulder

219
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,099
and said this, didn't you?

220
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:15,099
The infamous "Haruna" has come to pay us a visit.

221
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,499
Let's have her relax in her room for a while.

222
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:20,799
At that point, we still hadn't introduced ourselves

223
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,699
and Ran, who's about the same age as Haruna, was also present.

224
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,799
But you knew exactly which one she was,

225
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,599
although no one had actually met her yet.

226
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,099
That's when it suddenly hit me.

227
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:37,499
Maybe it was you who gave her the music box.

228
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:39,399
If that's true, then was it you?

229
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,199
Did you drop that koto on me because you got mad that

230
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,599
I was giving her the third degree?

231
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,399
No, that wasn't me.

232
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,699
Ran, turn the lights off.

233
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,799
-Hurry. -Yes.

234
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,399
Conan?

235
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,488
Conan?

236
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:07,288
Hey? Conan, where are you?

237
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,488
Ran, I'm over here.

238
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,088
How'd you get over there?

239
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,888
I've always been here.

240
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:15,888
Liar. I just saw your shadow on the screen door.

241
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,588
Take a look at the glass out in the hall.

242
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,988
The glass out in the hall?

243
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,188
What am I supposed to see?

244
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,888
Why, this it...

245
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:29,288
There's a piece of black paper taped to the glass.

246
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,288
It's shaped like Conan.

247
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:34,488
I put it there a little while ago because Uncle Kogoro told me to.

248
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:38,688
Then are you saying that the old man Ran saw was...

249
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:42,488
That's right, Ran saw a shadow picture.

250
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,588
An old man's figure, cut out of black paper

251
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:48,288
is taped to the glass in the hall.

252
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,688
If a car approached the back street,

253
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:53,288
the lights from the headlight will shine through

254
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:54,888
the half open back door

255
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,688
and the shadow of the paper cut old man

256
00:13:56,688 --> 00:14:01,188
will be reflected onto the screen door, that's the trick.

257
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,288
Now that you mention it, when I saw the old man's shadow,

258
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,088
I did hear a swooshing sound.

259
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:09,588
That was probably the sound of a car passing on the rain wet road.

260
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:10,688
I see.

261
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,488
So by using that trick, you don't have to actually be present

262
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,888
when the old man makes his appearance.

263
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,688
Shiro, even you could've.

264
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,988
Like I told you before, I was right here

265
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:21,888
-same as when you got attacked. -You could have done that too,

266
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:24,088
while being in this room.

267
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:25,888
It's a simple booby trap, all you need is some fishing line

268
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,988
and some hair pins to make it.

269
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,088
A booby trap?

270
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:31,188
The person who caused this commotion,

271
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,688
hung the koto from the ceiling in your grandfathers' room

272
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:35,188
and then let it fall,

273
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,388
it was just coincidence that you got hit by it.

274
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:42,788
Minoru, you snuck in there to check out the koto.

275
00:14:42,788 --> 00:14:45,788
That's right, that's how you got hit.

276
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:47,188
You don't know what you're talking about,

277
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:49,188
why would I want to search the koto for?

278
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,188
Because during dinner,

279
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:54,388
Haruna mentioned that the music box played Haru yo Koi

280
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:56,688
and since it was your grandmother's favorite song

281
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,488
and she always played it on the koto,

282
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:06,288
you thought the stamps just might be hidden inside the koto.

283
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:10,288
But even if the koto dropped down from the ceiling,

284
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:13,088
I don't see how it could have knocked him unconscious,

285
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,288
there wasn't enough momentum.

286
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:17,788
Besides, if he was going to look inside the koto,

287
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:19,988
wouldn't he have turned the lights on?

288
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:25,088
When we got there, the room was dark, wasn't it?

289
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:29,988
Minoru didn't not turn the lights on, he couldn't.

290
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:32,488
The device the culprit rigged raised the light up,

291
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,588
close to the ceiling and in the dark,

292
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:40,388
Minoru didn't know where the light cord was,

293
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:41,888
left with no other choice,

294
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:43,588
Minoru got down on the floor

295
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:44,988
and felt around the area the koto usually is,

296
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:47,388
when he found it, he intended to take it to his room.

297
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:50,088
Then he heard the sound of the string

298
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:53,588
rubbing against the fishing line and he looked up,

299
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,488
and of all the bad luck, that's when it fell on his head.

300
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:59,088
Minoru.

301
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,888
Okay, so you're right, you've got me.

302
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:05,888
But how was it rigged to drop the koto, anyway?

303
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,188
It's very simple.

304
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:12,088
First, you get one very long fishing line

305
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:15,988
wrap the light cord around the middle of the fishing line,

306
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:19,188
then pass both ends of the line under the string,

307
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:23,188
the koto is then probably temporarily placed on the chest.

308
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,188
Next, both ends of the line is passed through the transom

309
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,588
and went through Shiro's room, then Minoru's

310
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,088
and then Mr. and Mrs. Ogata's

311
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:32,088
until finally reaching the room Ran and Haruna were staying in.

312
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,888
Then, so the line wouldn't sag, both ends were tied

313
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:38,488
then set in place between the doors with a hair pin.

314
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:40,488
Next, take the koto off the chest and let it hang,

315
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:42,788
then your booby trap is complete.

316
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:46,288
After that, all you had to do was open the door...

317
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,488
The hair pin would be released

318
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:53,288
and that would lead to the koto falling.

319
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:56,788
Now wait just one minute, you're not saying that...

320
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:57,988
That's right.

321
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:00,088
The person responsible for tonight's ghostly apparition

322
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:03,188
is the person who opened that door.

323
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,088
Kazuko.

324
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,088
It was you, wasn't it?

325
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:09,588
Mother?

326
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:10,988
But why?

327
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,988
It's probably because

328
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:16,488
she didn't want Haruna to go looking for those stamps.

329
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:21,688
I'm pretty sure she rigged the booby trap while we were eating,

330
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:24,688
when she left to go prepare our bedding.

331
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:28,588
Then when she heard Ran and Haruna scream,

332
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,188
she came running and opened the door nonchalantly,

333
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,488
causing the koto to fall.

334
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:37,088
And then, while everyone was rushing to Shugo's room,

335
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,388
she removed the cut out from the window

336
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:43,388
and sent a message to Haruna's pocket bell from her cellular,

337
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,488
trying to scare her.

338
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,488
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"

339
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:51,388
She was trying to frighten Haruna away from this house.

340
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:56,988
But what did she do with all that fishing line after that?

341
00:17:56,988 --> 00:18:01,288
Mom was right behind us when we got to grandfather's room.

342
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,788
She didn't have time to take the paper off the window

343
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:06,788
and remove all the fishing line while using the telephone.

344
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:09,188
She had a very handy helper.

345
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,788
It's right behind Ran.

346
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:15,088
A fan?

347
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,688
I'm pretty sure she cut the tied end of the line

348
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:23,788
and pulled one end into this room then used tape to tape it.

349
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:27,388
To the back of this fans blade.

350
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:30,388
I see.

351
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,988
All she had to do was turn the switch on

352
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,488
and it would automatically reel the line in.

353
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:38,388
I still can't believe it though.

354
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:39,788
How could you think of such a thing

355
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:43,588
in the short time you had during dinner?

356
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:44,988
It's not impossible.

357
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:47,088
After all, this trick with the fishing line,

358
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,788
is something I picked up from the pranks the boys used to pull

359
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,488
when they were children.

360
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,688
What about the cut out of the old man?

361
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:57,488
Oh, that, a guest who stayed with us once

362
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:01,188
thought some leaves stuck to the window was someone's shadow,

363
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,788
I remembered that.

364
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:05,888
Haruna scared me.

365
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,588
She mentioned she collected stamps

366
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:10,188
and she said she wanted to visit us again.

367
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:14,888
Were you the one who sent me the messages before saying, 'Thief'?

368
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,888
Yes, that was me. I'm sorry.

369
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,088
Mother, that was terrible.

370
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:23,388
How could you break grandmothers koto over a thing like that?

371
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:26,888
Oh, that koto isn't worth anything.

372
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,588
-How can you say that? -The truth is,

373
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:33,688
I pawned the real koto and got a cheap replacement.

374
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:37,688
My new system kitchen, your new car,

375
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,688
Minoru's computer,

376
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:43,188
we were so far in debt.

377
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:45,588
Then I guess we'll just have to sell

378
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:47,188
the music box grandfather gave me.

379
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:50,188
Oh, but I had it looked at and I was told

380
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:53,188
it was just an ordinary souvenir item.

381
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:54,288
That's strange.

382
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:56,688
Grandfather told me that

383
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:59,288
in appreciation of my posing to be him,

384
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:00,788
he was giving me his music box,

385
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,288
those who knew what they were looking at

386
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,188
would realize it was worth 200 million.

387
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:08,088
200 million? That music box?

388
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:13,088
Dad bought that as a souvenir when he went to a hot spring.

389
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,888
Grandpa pulled a fast one on you.

390
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:18,788
The music box itself isn't worth anything,

391
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:21,388
it's the missing notes.

392
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,988
In Japan, we use the Do Re Mi musical scale

393
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:28,788
and also, the native notation, I Ro Ha.

394
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:31,388
The missing notes are 'La', 'Do' and 'La'

395
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:34,188
and if we use the I Ro Ha scale,

396
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:37,488
it would be 'I', 'Ha' and 'I'.

397
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,888
Ihai? (Mortuary tablet)

398
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,188
You don't mean?

399
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:48,388
-I don't believe it... -It can't be...

400
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,188
-I've got it. -This is it.

401
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,888
Oh, thank goodness.

402
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:03,088
Hip, hip, hurray...

403
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:06,388
What's going on?

404
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,188
Oh, thank you so much.

405
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,988
Now I can buy that koto back.

406
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:13,588
We owe it all to you.

407
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:16,788
Who are you anyway?

408
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:22,388
Well, the truth is, my name is Kogoro Mouri.

409
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:24,488
The... Kogoro Mouri?

410
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,688
The famous private detective?

411
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,188
That's me.

412
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,288
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

413
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,588
If we'd known that, we'd have asked you to look for stamps.

414
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:35,788
And Minoru wouldn't have gotten hurt.

415
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:37,688
Yes, well...

416
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:41,888
What a selfish bunch.

417
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,488
Thank you for everything.

418
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,188
No, we should thank you.

419
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,788
Are you sure you have no regrets, though?

420
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:19,588
Shugo might have intended to give you alone, those stamps.

421
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:20,788
I don't mind.

422
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,688
Because I got to keep something worth even more.

423
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:27,188
It's grandfathers pocket bell.

424
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:30,188
Haruna gave it to me.

425
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:34,188
And she asked if I'd continue to give her moral support.

426
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:36,388
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

427
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:39,588
You know, I think springs here.

428
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:42,788
Spring? It's almost summer.

429
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,888
Never mind, for Shiro, it's spring.

430
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:46,888
What's that supposed to mean?

431
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:52,488
Spring, come to me. Hurry to me.

432
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:56,988
It never comes to me.

433
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:03,488
Look out!

434
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:10,588
A bump?

435
00:24:10,588 --> 00:24:13,288
It wasn't such a big bump,

436
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:16,588
I don't understand why you're making such a big deal about it.

437
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,488
But Sonoko warned me

438
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:22,488
and I know that guy would too.

439
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,488
Next Conan,

440
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:28,509
"Unseen Weapon-Ran's First Case"

441
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,606
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,606
"Car"

443
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,206
In the next episode, Ran displays her finesse.

444
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:37,706
There's always only one truth!
