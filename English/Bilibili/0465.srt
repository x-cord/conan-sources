1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,799
Throwing beans!

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,199
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:06,499
The Black Organization and a boy.

4
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:07,899
A reunion that seems coincidental

5
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,399
crosses with a stormy incident!

6
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:10,699
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,299
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:59,784
Eisuke Hondo tells Pops about a strange part-time job.

10
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:03,684
It's work involving collecting trash from the trash dump in Toriya Town

11
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:06,484
and to exchange that trash on the following trash day.

12
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:10,384
We headed for the site just out of curiosity.

13
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:13,984
However, when we get there, we encountered a homicide case.

14
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:17,984
We met a boy who said he witnessed Rena Mizunashi's accident.

15
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:20,984
No doubt about it.

16
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,484
Which means...

17
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:25,784
Don't tell me this guy actually took us here because of the boy?

18
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:30,384
Finally, it's getting interesting.

19
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:37,484
"The Shadow of the Black Organization: Pearl Shooting Star"

20
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,984
Well? What kind of accident was it?

21
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:42,184
Well, you see...

22
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,684
The person riding the motorbike

23
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:49,084
suddenly came falling from the sky.

24
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:52,984
And that person's helmet came off, so I looked at the face.

25
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:56,584
You're talking about the Masked Yaiba program that was on the other day!

26
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,384
Masked Yaiba?

27
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:02,684
Yes. It's a scene from the Masked Yaiba program.

28
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,784
These guys were attacking him while he was riding his motorbike.

29
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:10,484
His mask comes off and Masked Yaiba's identity was about to be disclosed.

30
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:13,584
You're wrong!

31
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,584
No! I really...

32
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,684
Huh? Have we met before?

33
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:20,184
Huh?

34
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,084
No, I don't think so.

35
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,484
Then, what this boy is saying is...

36
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,784
Yeah.

37
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:28,384
From the shock of losing his mother,

38
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,884
he's probably confusing reality with something he saw in a movie or on TV.

39
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:35,184
Besides, if they wanted to shut him up,

40
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:38,084
they would've killed him, too.

41
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,184
The woman who died used to jog in the morning four times a week

42
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,784
after she went out to throw out the trash.

43
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:46,084
If they were going to shoot,

44
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,284
they would've done so.

45
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:55,484
They wouldn't do something as dangerous as to take the risk

46
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,484
of sneaking into the woman's room and wait for her to come home, right?

47
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:59,684
True.

48
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,584
Why don't we go to that room, then?

49
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,184
-Huh? -Huh?

50
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:06,184
You may come up with something, Pops.

51
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,884
Inspector.

52
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,184
What is it?

53
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,684
May I wait here?

54
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:19,284
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:22,584
Has he been using the wheelchair for long?

56
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:25,284
No, he's been using it from a month ago.

57
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:28,884
He went fishing with the people from his company

58
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:31,984
and broke his leg after sliding in a rocky area.

59
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:36,284
The doctor said that his cast will be removed in six months.

60
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,384
Which means his room is on the first floor?

61
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:42,884
No. It's upstairs on the second floor next to Mrs. Funemoto's room.

62
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,884
When Mr. Funemoto goes upstairs,

63
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,484
I lend him my shoulder,

64
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,884
then I bring his wheelchair up to him later.

65
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,584
This is Mrs. Funemoto's room.

66
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,584
This is the veranda

67
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:08,584
where Mrs. Funemoto was found shot in the head?

68
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,684
But how did the culprit make it into this room?

69
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,284
By the railing,

70
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,684
there is a rope with a hook attached to it.

71
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,884
The culprit probably used it to climb up onto the veranda,

72
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,984
broke the window and snuck in.

73
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:26,084
This room is facing the river bank, so not too many people would notice.

74
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,284
But isn't it strange?

75
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:32,084
This door, although the glass near the bottom lock is broken,

76
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,984
the glass at the top isn't.

77
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:39,684
Opening only the bottom lock won't open the door, will it?

78
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,184
That part bothered us, too.

79
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:44,084
Stop running around, Conan.

80
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:47,884
Maybe it's because Mrs. Funemoto liked the stars during the night,

81
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,784
she used to frequently come out to the veranda

82
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,084
and gaze at the stars.

83
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,784
So she may have forgotten to lock the door.

84
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,384
Mrs. Funemoto was shot the night before last night,

85
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,684
around 9:00 pm or 10:00 pm.

86
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:04,084
She just came back from a home party held by one of her friends, right?

87
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,184
Yes.

88
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:09,884
She came home and said she was going to her room to sleep.

89
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:13,384
Which means the culprit snuck into this room before she entered

90
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,684
and was hiding somewhere in this room.

91
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:20,584
When Mrs. Funemoto stepped out to the veranda like always, he shot her.

92
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:27,784
He fled after stealing the pearl necklace and bracelet she was wearing.

93
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,584
So the culprit is a professional after all.

94
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,484
But it seems the culprit was in a bit of haste.

95
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:39,084
The culprit left the rope with the hook attached to it below the veranda

96
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:43,084
as well as a rifle equipped with a silencer behind.

97
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:46,084
Well, I guess even a professional makes mistakes.

98
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:48,084
But talk about a super klutz!

99
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:52,584
Look. There is a pearl earring up here that's been left behind.

100
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,984
It has a lot of jewellery around it and looks super expensive.

101
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:58,184
I wonder why the culprit didn't take it?

102
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,384
You idiot.

103
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:03,284
It's a pearl, so she probably wore it to the party

104
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:05,984
and she took it off right after coming in.

105
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,184
The culprit who was hiding probably didn't notice it.

106
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:12,984
Mrs. Funemoto was wearing that earring that day.

107
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,384
But it's strange. Why is there only one?

108
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:21,184
The other side was on the ear of the victim, right?

109
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:24,084
Yeah. She had it on her right ear.

110
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:26,784
I thought the culprit didn't notice it

111
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,184
because he was hiding against the wall of the veranda.

112
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:32,584
If so, Mrs. Funemoto was a really scatterbrained person.

113
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:33,784
What?

114
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:36,984
I mean, she went out to the veranda after taking only one earring off.

115
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,484
That doesn't seem normal, does it?

116
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:44,784
Well, I guess it can't be helped if someone called her out to the veranda

117
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:46,084
when she was taking off her earrings though.

118
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:54,084
Pardon me, but where were you two days ago, between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm?

119
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:55,884
Me?

120
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:59,284
I was together with my friends in the living room.

121
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:03,284
Did your friends also saw Mrs. Funemoto?

122
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,284
Yes, once after she came back.

123
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,484
She came into the living room to say she's going to bed.

124
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:09,984
Where was the boy then?

125
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:12,584
I think he was already asleep in bed.

126
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:16,584
He was running around all over the house since sundown.

127
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:21,884
I cleaned up the mess he made and went to bed around midnight.

128
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:25,284
Then, where was Mr. Funemoto at that time?

129
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,384
He also went to sleep, as did his son.

130
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:31,384
He had dinner and went to bed before Mrs. Funemoto came home.

131
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:35,184
His room was next to his wife's room, right?

132
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:36,384
Yes.

133
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:41,784
He said he was tired since he has been keeping his son company all day.

134
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,684
Inspector.

135
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:47,084
Does that mean the husband is the culprit?

136
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,084
That's impossible.

137
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:51,384
I already told you, didn't I?

138
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:54,084
Judging from the angle of the bullet entry point

139
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,184
that pierced through the back of her head to her forehead,

140
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:59,984
the culprit must be someone taller than 180 centimetres.

141
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:03,384
Mr. Funemoto is approximately 160 centimetres.

142
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:07,384
Moreover, someone who's sitting in a wheelchair couldn't have done it.

143
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:10,284
But what if his broken bone is actually already healed

144
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,584
and he stood up on his wheelchair

145
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:14,884
and fired the gun?

146
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:17,484
I thought so too and asked the doctor about it,

147
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:20,184
but the day before the incident, he took an X-Ray of his leg

148
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,284
and the bone was still not healed.

149
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,684
The doctor said he probably still cannot stand up on his own.

150
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:29,184
Maybe he had her kneel over so he could shoot her from above?

151
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:31,084
No way.

152
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:35,084
If so, there should be bullet hole somewhere in the room, right?

153
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:40,684
But there are no such hole anywhere in this room or this house.

154
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:42,584
Is that so?

155
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,284
We also looked for the pearl necklace and bracelet,

156
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,284
but couldn't find them anywhere.

157
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,884
Maybe they are in the trash?

158
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:51,684
-In the trash? -I see.

159
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:55,384
It could have something to do with the case Eisuke discovered.

160
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:56,484
A case?

161
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:57,684
What is it?

162
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:01,684
There's a guy who's doing part-time work collecting trash from this area.

163
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:06,584
It's for a group researching how to make trash harmless.

164
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,184
It seems that he's been working from about two weeks ago,

165
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:13,184
but there's no sign that this group checked the trash that was collected.

166
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:14,484
I see.

167
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:17,184
In other words, the husband killed his wife,

168
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,784
and in order to make it look like a robbery,

169
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,484
he threw the necklace and bracelet away as trash.

170
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:25,284
He then asked someone to collect it for him.

171
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:26,884
That can't be.

172
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,984
Unfortunately, that's not possible either.

173
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:31,984
Of course we have checked inside the trash cans,

174
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:33,884
as well as inside the trash bags,

175
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,284
but nothing was found.

176
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:36,384
I see.

177
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:39,484
How much was the necklace and bracelet worth?

178
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:42,384
I heard that it cost about one million yen for both.

179
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:45,984
Mr. Funemoto bought them for his wife on her birthday.

180
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,584
Her name is carved on the clasp.

181
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,684
Hey.

182
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:50,884
Takami.

183
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,984
Please turn the temperature of the air conditioner up!

184
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:54,984
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:57,284
Can't he use the remote controller?

186
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:59,284
Mr. Funemoto is not good with machines.

187
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:03,784
Thank you.

188
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:04,984
No problem.

189
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,784
The officers are still here.

190
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:10,984
Did you come up with a clue on the culprit?

191
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,884
No, not yet.

192
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:15,484
Daddy, I'm hungry.

193
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,984
It's this late already.

194
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,984
Shall we order a take-out again?

195
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:22,984
Hey, hey. It's about time for us to eat some of your homemade cooking.

196
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:24,984
Okay, I'll go make something right away.

197
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,384
What's that?

198
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,484
There's something here.

199
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:32,584
Onion?

200
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:36,084
What can I make with what we have here?

201
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,584
If it's okay with you, I can help you.

202
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:41,184
There seems to be a lot of unwashed dishes.

203
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:44,884
After what happened to Mrs. Funemoto, I just can't seem to do anything.

204
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:46,484
Would you please?

205
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,484
Yes.

206
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,284
The expiration date for these eggs is February 4th.

207
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,684
That's yesterday, so I don't think you should use them.

208
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:59,484
Wait a second. If February 4th was yesterday,

209
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,584
the night before would be...

210
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,084
The 3rd.

211
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:04,984
Wait, Ran!

212
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:07,884
Hey, what did you make for dinner the day before yesterday?

213
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,584
Huh? The day before yesterday?

214
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,484
Well...

215
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:17,284
Yellowtail teriyaki, boiled vegetables, miso soup and tofu.

216
00:12:17,284 --> 00:12:18,384
I think that was it.

217
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:21,884
That sounds delicious.

218
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,934
Takami, where's our meal?

219
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,234
Oh, well...

220
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:36,134
We have to go shopping first.

221
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:39,434
Hurry up, then. I'm starving.

222
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:40,534
Okay.

223
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:43,534
I guess we'll get going too, and then come back again.

224
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:44,634
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,334
Then, I...

226
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,834
I'm...

227
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,434
You don't need me anymore?

228
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:51,634
Yes.

229
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:52,934
Please wait.

230
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:56,934
Don't you think this incident is related to the part-time job I mentioned?

231
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,734
Like I said...

232
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:02,634
But why not check a little more? You may find some connection.

233
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:04,034
Gosh...

234
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:19,334
What's going on?

235
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:22,134
I just realized something now.

236
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,134
I figured out the culprit's trick on how to make the jewellery disappear.

237
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:29,334
It's the blind spot that we failed to notice.

238
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,934
Make it disappear?

239
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:33,234
Don't tell me they were flushed down the toilet?

240
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:36,534
We checked the sewers too, but we didn't find anything.

241
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,934
Well, we'll talk about the details after the meal.

242
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:42,034
If possible, we'd like you to cook for us, Ms. Shigeno.

243
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,034
Yes, right away.

244
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:45,434
No, the ones who are going shopping

245
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,934
are Ran...

246
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,534
and Eisuke.

247
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,834
We'll ask Mr. Funemoto's son, Toji, to go as well.

248
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,334
Is that okay with you, Mr. Funemoto?

249
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,434
Yes, sure.

250
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:59,034
Hey.

251
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:02,134
Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Mouri?

252
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,734
I don't understand what you're talking about or trying to do at all!

253
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:09,734
Well, it's nothing unusual for him to change his views drastically.

254
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:13,234
He's still too young to know the truth.

255
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:18,834
Imagine him knowing his mother was killed by his own father,

256
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,834
Mr. Tatsuhito Funemoto.

257
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:27,234
I thought its better if we don't tell your son just yet.

258
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,434
It seems certain that Mr. Funemoto was in his room

259
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,734
next to his wife's room at the time of the murder.

260
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,434
But he is only 160 centimetres tall and in a wheelchair.

261
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,234
He can't go anywhere to hide the jewellery.

262
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:43,934
Just one pearl earring was left behind on the desk, wasn't it?

263
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:46,834
Yeah. Conan said earlier

264
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,734
that maybe she was taking off her earring

265
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,334
when somebody called her out to the veranda.

266
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,634
Inspector, doesn't it bother you?

267
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:56,434
About how Mrs. Funemoto was called?

268
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:59,134
What distracted her that she would forget to take off her other earring

269
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,434
and go to the veranda?

270
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,734
Don't you want to know what those words were?

271
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:04,734
Words?

272
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,934
I presume this is what Mr. Funemoto told his wife.

273
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:11,134
It's a shooting star.

274
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:13,534
Look, right above.

275
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:16,134
Shooting star?

276
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,434
Above?

277
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:18,634
I see!

278
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,634
A shooting star disappears right away,

279
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,134
so she hurried off to the veranda to see it.

280
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,534
It's because she liked stars so much.

281
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,634
Then what does "above" means?

282
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,934
If he made his wife look upwards,

283
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:29,834
he would shoot from a low position sitting in his wheelchair.

284
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,134
The bullet would enter from the top part of the back of the head

285
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:35,234
and pierced through the forehead.

286
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,834
It would give an illusion as if someone who was tall had shot her.

287
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:42,634
That way, the gun would be faced upwards.

288
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,434
No bullet hole would be left in the room,

289
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:46,534
because the bullets would go towards the river bank.

290
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:48,434
What about the window glass?

291
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:49,734
Since he's in a wheelchair,

292
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:52,334
he couldn't reach the window glass above.

293
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,034
So he couldn't crack it.

294
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:56,434
Then what about the pearl?

295
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:59,134
Let's say he killed his wife in the second floor room.

296
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:01,634
He couldn't have dispose of it outside, right?

297
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:05,034
Mr. Funemoto's leg is broken.

298
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:08,734
Did you really check the house thoroughly?

299
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,634
Yeah, we checked every place they could be.

300
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:15,734
How about inside the vacuum cleaner?

301
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,334
Vacuum cleaner?

302
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,234
We actually didn't look there.

303
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,734
But Mr. Funemoto is not good with machines

304
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,134
and if he were to use it, it would make a loud noise.

305
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:25,834
Besides, a person in a wheelchair

306
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:29,234
couldn't possibly take out a vacuum cleaner with nobody noticing.

307
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:32,234
It's true that if Mr. Funemoto used the vacuum cleaner,

308
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,334
someone would notice.

309
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:36,334
If Ms. Shigeno did, it's another story, right?

310
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,334
Huh?

311
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:42,334
Please recall what those three did the day the murder was committed.

312
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,434
Toji was running around the first floor from sundown.

313
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:48,934
Ms. Shigeno was cleaning up after Toji.

314
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:51,134
What about it?

315
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,534
It's only natural that children run around and mess the place up.

316
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:55,034
There's nothing's strange about it, right?

317
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:58,934
Yes, but what if it was February 3rd?

318
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:00,934
February...

319
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,334
3rd?

320
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,434
February 3rd is...

321
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,634
You mean...

322
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:09,934
Right. That day, an old custom handed down for generations is held.

323
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,934
It's Setsubun, right?

324
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:13,034
Conan?

325
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,034
Setsubun?

326
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,934
I'm sure that Toji had his father wear an ogre's mask

327
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,734
and was throwing beans saying,

328
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,934
"Devils out! Good luck in!"

329
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:26,134
And Ms. Shigeno later got rid of everything.

330
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,634
Hey! Don't tell me that...

331
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,234
He took the pearls apart, mix them with the beans

332
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,834
and had her suck it up with the vacuum cleaner?

333
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:34,834
The size and shape are similar. Moreover, there were a lot of them.

334
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,834
If she began vacuuming after 11:00 pm,

335
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,934
she must've wanted to finish as soon as possible.

336
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,134
She wouldn't have noticed the pearls among the beans

337
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:44,634
and probably sucked everything up together.

338
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,934
So this is how the crime was carried out.

339
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:54,634
From sundown, Mr. Funemoto went throwing beans around the house with Toji.

340
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:57,934
After his wife came back, he went to her room saying he wanted to talk.

341
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:01,034
He shot her on the veranda the way I mentioned a while ago.

342
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,234
He hooked a rope with a hook on it to the veranda railing

343
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:06,534
and cracked the glass to make it look a break-in.

344
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:11,534
Then he broke the pearl necklace and bracelet apart.

345
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:14,034
He threw them down from the second floor railing

346
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:17,034
towards the carpet on the first floor and scattered them.

347
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:19,934
All that's left to do is for Ms Shigeno

348
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,234
to suck them up with the vacuum cleaner.

349
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,534
Check the vacuum cleaner.

350
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,234
Yes, sir.

351
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:28,434
If Mr. Funemoto threw the vacuum cleaner bag out as burnable trash,

352
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:31,934
he didn't have to leave the house at all to get everything out of his way.

353
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:34,634
Yes, after making the part-timer collect this,

354
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,334
he would tell him that the work is over.

355
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:39,834
After his leg has healed, he will take the pearls out of the trash.

356
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,634
He will put them back together again, hire another part-timer

357
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,934
and make him take it to the pawn shop or something.

358
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:47,034
Since Mr. Funemoto's wife's name is on the clasp,

359
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:51,734
it would look like a burglar or someone really did steal them.

360
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,234
But where's the proof?

361
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,434
You don't have proof, do you?

362
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,334
Fingerprints.

363
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,234
Was Mr. Funemoto's fingerprints found on the pearls?

364
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:01,734
They're married so I'm sure he has touched them eventually.

365
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,934
No, not the pearls.

366
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:08,634
Mr. Funemoto used something to keep from getting gun powder traces on him.

367
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:12,334
He pulled the trigger through the lace curtains.

368
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:17,334
I figured out what it was when I saw the onion on the wheelchair.

369
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,334
Onion?

370
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:22,934
The onion being there means that it was on his finger.

371
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,434
He didn't realize that something he wore on his hand

372
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:28,434
had onion on it.

373
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,834
Yes, the kitchen rubber glove.

374
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,534
Mr. Funemoto used the rubber gloves in the kitchen that he had hidden

375
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,034
to kill his wife.

376
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:40,134
The following day, you returned it secretly to the kitchen after breakfast.

377
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:43,834
Then you made Ms. Shigeno go check on your wife.

378
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,134
Inspector, we found the pearls in the vacuum cleaner!

379
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:49,034
Get the forensic officer and check the kitchen rubber gloves!

380
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,034
Yes, sir!

381
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:53,034
What Mr. Funemoto didn't expect was that, after the incident,

382
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:56,034
Ms. Shigeno stopped cooking.

383
00:19:56,034 --> 00:20:00,234
That's why you asked her to make something a while ago, didn't you?

384
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:03,834
You wanted Ms. Shigeno to put on the rubber gloves to wash the dishes.

385
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:08,734
Your fingerprints would be mixed with hers on the inside of the gloves.

386
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,534
You wanted the gun powder traces on the gloves to wash off

387
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:11,634
so that nothing would be detected.

388
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,834
Mr. Funemoto.

389
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:17,934
Please tell me if I'm wrong in any way.

390
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,234
Mr. Funemoto, please say...

391
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,834
Please say it's all a lie!

392
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,334
Did you know?

393
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,334
That she was addicted to partying?

394
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,134
For the past six months,

395
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:33,934
I had to stay home because of my injury.

396
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,334
I didn't notice at all

397
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,434
that my wife had accumulated expenses

398
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:40,134
in order to hold parties once a week

399
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,234
and was in great debt.

400
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,534
I didn't think she would go that far.

401
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,534
Money! Money! I don't have money!

402
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,934
That's right. I'll use this house as collateral and borrow money.

403
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:52,934
Hey, you...

404
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,634
I'll divorce you if you want.

405
00:20:55,634 --> 00:21:00,134
It seems that you no longer make me shine.

406
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,834
I've got plenty of other sponsors to go to.

407
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:04,834
Hey.

408
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,934
I'm not going to take care of Toji either.

409
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,134
I'm sick and tired of raising a child already.

410
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:13,134
Divorced with a child doesn't suit a star like me, does it?

411
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:17,834
I just couldn't forgive her for what she said,

412
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,834
despite being a wife and mother.

413
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,134
I'm home!

414
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,234
Daddy!

415
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,634
What's the matter?

416
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:25,834
Are you crying?

417
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,634
If so, let's throw beans again and cheer up!

418
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:31,434
I'm sure that will make mommy in heaven happy.

419
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,334
I guess so, Toji.

420
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:38,334
I'm going to leave you and go out for a while.

421
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:44,834
Because I'm an ogre that took away a precious person from you.

422
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,434
He went home?

423
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,434
After showering Toji with questions,

424
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,534
he suddenly said he had something to do.

425
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:20,834
Showering him with questions?

426
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,134
He asked about the accident Toji saw

427
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,034
and about the foreign lady who questioned him.

428
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,834
Toji said that when he asked the lady who she was,

429
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:31,034
-the lady seems to have answered "Uma-uma" in English. -Uma-uma?

430
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,134
I wonder what it means.

431
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:33,134
Uma...

432
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:34,834
Uma-uma?

433
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:41,034
A secret makes a woman a woman.

434
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,434
Vermouth?

435
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,134
Hondo.

436
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,234
It's the name of that guy.

437
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:49,634
You mean the one that Kir killed?

438
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:50,834
Yeah.

439
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,334
His friend kept calling out to him,

440
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:56,634
as if chanting, despite him not being able to hear a thing.

441
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,534
Hondo...

442
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:00,934
Like so.

443
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:07,834
"Next Episode"

444
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,134
Let's all split up and look for her.

445
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,334
Darn it!

446
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,634
Wait, Genta!

447
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,134
I'm sure there's a cliff over that side!

448
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,034
There!

449
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:19,034
It's a person.

450
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,934
A person is floating in the lake.

451
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:24,934
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

452
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:33,134
Next Conan, "Unbreakable Snowman (Part 1)"

453
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,734
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:53,334
"The gloves of a snowman"

455
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,334
-Officer Takagi, read "te-bu-ku-ro" backwards. -I'm not falling for it.

456
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,234
It hurts! I didn't say anything!
