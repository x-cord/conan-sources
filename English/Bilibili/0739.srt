1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,340
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,240
If there's an ocean, there are fish.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,940
Like so, I happen to be at the scene of a crime.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,740
It all started when I got a job request from a woman bartender,

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,040
Yuzuki Fukui, who's in love with me,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,940
and came to the pool bar where she works.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,340
Her request was for me to solve a queer mystery.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,940
In which during work, she would hear a popping sound

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,840
like that of a champagne bottle being opened

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,640
and then smell the fragrance of yuzu soon after that.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,140
When I was racking my brains trying to solve this mystery,

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,840
one of the four people who was sitting behind me

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,340
was suddenly killed.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,040
The victim is Chikafumi Usuda, age 51.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,640
He seems to be the department head of some company.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,340
He was killed by poisoning.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,140
It seems that the perp used something like an eyeleteer,

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,440
laced the sharp tip of it with nerve poison

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,940
and poked it in behind his neck.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,240
The suspects are the three who say

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,740
they were celebrating the victim's birthday at this shop.

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,340
Kensaku Hatsumura, age 31,

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,740
who was told to buy a billiard cue for Usuda's birthday.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,540
Likewise, Monpei Kogure, age 28 was told to buy darts.

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,640
And the one who was told to buy a rare poster of Yoko Okino

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,440
along with a lot of film was Mika Kishiura, age 30.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,840
Although the most suspicious were Kogure who brought the darts

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,440
and Kishiura who was crushing ice

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
for whiskey and water using the ice pick.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
So...

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,040
I guess I'll have to solve the case

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,840
without sleeping tonight.

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,940
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,840
are slashed by the light of deduction.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,540
A deduction show at Blue Parrot.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,740
Expose the trick of the hidden murder weapon.

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,940
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,470
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 2)"

41
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,670
What?

42
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,370
There was no trace of poison being laced?

43
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,070
Not even on the darts or the ice pick?

44
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,770
No, sir. According to forensics,

45
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,370
neither poison nor luminol reaction was detected.

46
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,470
Of course the three were checked, weren't they?

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,570
Yes.

48
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,470
None of the three possessed poisoned bottles or bags.

49
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,270
I see.

50
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,070
What's going on? No murder weapon.

51
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,870
It's the same as the pick-pocket case the other day.

52
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,970
Talking about the pick-pocket case, Inspector...

53
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,270
Did you tell Jodie about the incident?

54
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,970
No. She's an outsider.

55
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,670
There's no need to tell her about it.

56
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,770
I guess so.

57
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,670
Officer Takagi.

58
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,570
-What incident is it? -What?

59
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,670
Well, the thing is...

60
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,770
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

61
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,070
We're going to search inside the shop once again.

62
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,470
Yes, sir!

63
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,570
I wonder what "the incident"

64
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,870
that Officer Takagi mentioned was about?

65
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,670
The thing that bothered me about that incident

66
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,770
was just that pregnant lady.

67
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,570
What's that?

68
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,070
Yuzuki.

69
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,870
What is it, Conan?

70
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,270
What's that hanging down from the ceiling?

71
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,770
That's a torn piece of braided tinsel.

72
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,770
A torn piece of braided tinsel?

73
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,170
Right! It was stuck to the ceiling with a thumbtack,

74
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,070
but when I pulled it in order to remove it, it tore.

75
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,270
There were customers who reserved this shop last week

76
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,270
that held a party here, you see.

77
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,070
The ceiling here is dark so it's not too conspicuous,

78
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,370
that's why I just left it as is.

79
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,170
But I guess it's quite visible?

80
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,470
Yes! When I talk to adults, I look up, you see.

81
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,970
I see.

82
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,770
But I guess since you're always looking up,

83
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,670
your attention isn't on the ground below, is it, Mr. Detective?

84
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,370
-What? -Look!

85
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,570
On the sole of Mr. Mouri's shoe.

86
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,170
There's gum stuck on it, isn't there?

87
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,070
When he bent over to the corpse the first time, it wasn't there.

88
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,770
I wonder where he stepped on it?

89
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,070
How about it? Did you find anything?

90
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,070
No, nothing, sir.

91
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,670
Don't move!

92
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,970
Pops, it seems you stepped on the evidence.

93
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,170
What?

94
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,870
Officer Takagi, remove it for him!

95
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,370
Yes, sir!

96
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,870
This is not gum but clay.

97
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,170
-Something's molded on it. -What?

98
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:13,770
It looks to be 4 mirror image alphabets, E P D H,

99
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,270
and on top of it, there's a protruded part.

100
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,370
If the letters EPDH are mirrored images,

101
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,370
then the correct line up would be HDPE.

102
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,570
High density polyethylene.

103
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,470
In other words, plastic?

104
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,470
And the protrusion was because

105
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,270
the part where the clay was stuck onto was dented.

106
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,270
Which means, it was attached to the bottom of that thing.

107
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,070
But why would clay be stuck on the bottom of something like that?

108
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,570
Well, well.

109
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,870
If things were as always, I would already be off work

110
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,570
and humming a tune taking a hot bath by now.

111
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,670
Taking a bath...

112
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,670
I see. So, that's the story.

113
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,670
The murder weapon didn't disappear at all.

114
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,870
The perp took advantage of that

115
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,370
and lifted off the murder weapon.

116
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,770
Out of visual range of the adults.

117
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,470
I got it, Inspector.

118
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,970
The perp who killed Mr. Chikafumi Usuda.

119
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,870
-What? -Really, Mr. Mouri?

120
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,170
Yes.

121
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,070
The perps are the customers who had it out with the victim.

122
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,370
Although they seem to have left already,

123
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,770
if they took the poisoned needle

124
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,370
that they used for committing the murder with them,

125
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,870
it's only natural that the murder weapon

126
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,670
can't be found inside the shop.

127
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,070
Rather, so you may want to think

128
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,670
but the fact isn't that way at all.

129
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,970
What? What on earth are you talking about?

130
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,470
Well, no. What I just said was...

131
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,170
It's him, the other me.

132
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,270
Detectives usually have another self within themselves

133
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,270
who can objectively analyze their own deductions,

134
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,670
but my other self always pops out at the worse time.

135
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,970
It seems that the inspector and the others can hear it too,

136
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,170
so it may look as if I'm actually saying it.

137
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,970
I really have no sense of doing anything of that sort.

138
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,970
I feel like some unidentified thing has taken over my body.

139
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,670
No, no. Rather than that, the problem is

140
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,370
the slight pain that runs through my neck after that.

141
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,470
Right, this is it.

142
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,870
And that intolerable and irresistible sleepiness that takes over.

143
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,870
This is probably the result of my brain cells working to the max.

144
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,770
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

145
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,570
I'm starting to like this sleepiness recently.

146
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,170
Why?

147
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:01,128
Mr. Mouri...

148
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,828
Mr. Mouri!

149
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:11,128
Mr. Mouri, are you awake?

150
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:15,428
I mean, everybody's gone home already!

151
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,228
What about the case?

152
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,228
Just what're you talking about?

153
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:25,928
You just finished the Sleeping Kogoro Deduction Show!

154
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:28,028
Right. And when I snap back to myself,

155
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,728
the case is solved.

156
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,828
Well, I see through the truth,

157
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:35,128
and relay it to the authorities.

158
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,128
Since I use up whatever power is left in me,

159
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:40,128
I don't remember a thing.

160
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:43,928
So, the perp was the customer who had it out with the victim.

161
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,228
Huh? Didn't you mention that

162
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,628
a customer who just happened to have it out with the victim

163
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:52,228
couldn't have so conveniently had a poison needle ready?

164
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,028
Then, don't tell me that

165
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,928
the perp was among those three

166
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:59,628
that work at the same company as the victim.

167
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:01,028
Huh? Yes.

168
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,228
How could that be?

169
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:06,628
Because although they had what could be used as murder weapons,

170
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:09,928
no poison or blood was found on anything!

171
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:13,228
Are you all right?

172
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:16,228
I mean, didn't you think it was impossible too, Yuzuki?

173
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,428
What?

174
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,428
So you were just testing

175
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:24,228
if I really understood your deduction, weren't you?

176
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:25,928
Yes, sort of.

177
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:30,528
I was really convinced and I really understood!

178
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,728
I had no idea that

179
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:36,328
the perp had hidden the murder weapon in that manner.

180
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,228
In that manner?

181
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:42,628
The experiment you did with Conan's help was great, too!

182
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:47,028
You asked Officer Takagi to go and buy a film case.

183
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,828
Then after pouring about one-third of it with water,

184
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:53,028
you shattered the carbonic bath tablets

185
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,328
that you also asked him to buy for you into sugar cube size

186
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:57,228
and put them in the case.

187
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:01,928
Then you closed the lid of the film case turned the case upside down,

188
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:04,728
placing it facing lid down on the table.

189
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:08,028
Then, in about 2 and a half to 3 minutes...

190
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,728
Like so.

191
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:23,028
The so-called film case rocket.

192
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:27,528
The foaming bath tablet causes carbonic acid gas.

193
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,728
The gas the fills up inside the film case,

194
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:34,328
pushes open the lid of the case like a rocket and flies up high.

195
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,228
The fragrance of yuzu.

196
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:41,728
Right. The perp must've used

197
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,028
a carbonic bath tablet that smelled of yuzu.

198
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:48,128
What about the popping sound that I heard 2 or 3 times before?

199
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:51,928
The perp tried it out several times here.

200
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,228
To test whether the murder weapon

201
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,928
that was placed on top of the film case

202
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,728
would poke into the ceiling of this shop after it was launched.

203
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:01,328
He put the murder weapon on it?

204
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:04,428
The murder weapon is an ice pick like item, you know?

205
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:07,828
Something so heavy could never be placed on it.

206
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,428
The tip of the steel dart is removable,

207
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,328
and weighs approximately 18 grams.

208
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:16,328
There should be no problem launching it.

209
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,528
Moreover, the perp stuck clay onto the bottom of the case

210
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:22,028
and fixed the tip of the dart onto it.

211
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:27,028
A cylindrical poster was also used as a guide as well as to hide it.

212
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:30,428
This way, even if it were to go slightly off track when launching,

213
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:34,228
it would reach the ceiling without fail.

214
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,728
Am I wrong in some way?

215
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,528
The one who bought the darts

216
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,428
as a birthday present for the victim...

217
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:44,228
Mr. Monpei Kogure!

218
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,328
If it were you,

219
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,328
you could have laced the tip of the dart with poison

220
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:53,728
and put it back into the case.

221
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,428
This trick of using the film case rocket

222
00:13:56,428 --> 00:14:00,428
could only have been set up by you who was near the poster.

223
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:05,228
Mr. Kogure, probably, after the victim got wasted,

224
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:08,428
deliberately lost when playing billiards or darts

225
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,728
with the other two to get out of the game.

226
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:12,828
After being left behind with the victim,

227
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:15,228
he put on a pretense of covering him with a jacket or something

228
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:17,428
and poked the poison laced tip of the dart

229
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,128
into the neck of the victim.

230
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:23,228
After removing the tip of the dart,

231
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:28,628
he switched it with another dart tip that was prepared beforehand.

232
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,328
The tip laced with poison

233
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,328
was fixed onto the bottom of the film case with clay.

234
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:37,028
After hiding the murder weapon between his crotch or something,

235
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,928
all he had to do later was distract the other two

236
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:43,928
and set the film case rocket on the table.

237
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,628
Right, by saying something like

238
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:49,428
doesn't that customer look like some celebrity?

239
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:53,228
That is, of course, after he ordered a bottle of champagne.

240
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,728
Come to think of it, back then...

241
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,028
Then how about another one of the first champagne that we drank?

242
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,428
Yes! That was good.

243
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:02,928
-What do you say? -Fine with me.

244
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:06,028
Excuse me! A bottle of champagne, please!

245
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:08,828
-Right away! -And three glasses, too!

246
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:12,728
That person at the counter, isn't he Kogoro Mouri?

247
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:16,528
No joke! You mean that renown detective?

248
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:19,328
I somehow feel like I'm being watched.

249
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:20,928
I want to take a picture of him!

250
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,528
Maybe he's just a look alike?

251
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:25,628
I guess so. I don't think he'd be such a drunkard.

252
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:30,728
And to finish it off, you pulled out the cork of the champagne

253
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:34,328
almost simultaneous to the sound of the rocket taking off.

254
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,528
What's with this? It's really tight.

255
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:40,428
Hey! Don't face it this way, you know!

256
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,228
I know.

257
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,428
If you splash the champagne

258
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:51,428
that bursts forth onto the poster after the launch,

259
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:57,828
you can just wipe off the remains of the carbonic bath tablet.

260
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:01,828
As proof of this, the wet part of the poster

261
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,328
should smell like yuzu.

262
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,428
True.

263
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:13,528
But this poster was what Ms. Kishiura had bought, wasn't it?

264
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:17,828
It seems that the victim repeatedly kept asking for it.

265
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:21,228
If it turned out that she didn't buy the poster,

266
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:25,228
he was probably going to prepare another poster anyway.

267
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:29,028
If he gave the dart board to the victim beforehand,

268
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:31,328
it's assumable that he would be asking for darts to go with it.

269
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,028
And as for the film cases,

270
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:36,328
if you know beforehand that he's going to be asking for

271
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,728
a lot of pictures to be taken for his blog,

272
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:41,528
this is also presumable.

273
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,328
Well, everything will be answered

274
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,628
by that thing poked into the ceiling.

275
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:51,828
That murder weapon over there.

276
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:56,028
If it weren't for Mr. Kogure who bought the darts,

277
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:59,928
it wouldn't be possible to prepare the same tips for the darts.

278
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,228
But if the only thing poked in is the tip of the dart,

279
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:05,028
the film case with the clay attached to it

280
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:08,828
should also come falling somewhere, no?

281
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,428
That's true.

282
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:14,228
But back then, everyone is panicked

283
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:16,628
because the important poster for the victim is wet with champagne.

284
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:20,128
Even if it were to have dropped,

285
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:23,728
it would only look as if he hurriedly wiped the table off.

286
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:25,628
By the way, the clay on the film case peeled off

287
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,328
from the impact of the case falling to the floor

288
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:30,128
and I happened to step on it.

289
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:33,028
And the mirrored image of the alphabets HDPE

290
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:35,228
were molded on that clay.

291
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,028
Because that's what's usually

292
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,928
indicated on the bottom of film cases.

293
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:43,328
Then what about the pieces of carbonic bath tablets

294
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,428
that were left on the table?

295
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:48,228
He probably put it into the beer that he was drinking.

296
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:50,728
Because foams look natural in beer.

297
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:52,828
It'll completely dissolve.

298
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:55,528
Well, his perfect crime

299
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:58,528
thanks to the Sleeping Kogoro having been here

300
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,428
has indeed vanished like the foams.

301
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:09,728
I see. What a good line.

302
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,328
You said that yourself, didn't you?

303
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,928
The inspector said that you don't remember a thing

304
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:19,928
after you solve the case,

305
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:21,928
but it was really true.

306
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,928
Which means you don't even remember that the motive of the killer

307
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,728
was to avenge the death of his colleague who committed suicide

308
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:31,128
because of terrible power harassment from the department head?

309
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,828
Is that right? Nothing what so ever.

310
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:38,128
Gosh, you were really awesome, and yet...

311
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,128
No, hold it.

312
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,528
It's not possible that I don't remember a thing.

313
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:46,528
Don't tell me that the one I thought was the other me

314
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:50,228
was the one who is subconsciously asleep in me.

315
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:54,428
"The real Kogoro Mouri" -The real me!

316
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:56,428
I see!

317
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,928
I normally save energy and accumulate my powers to be used

318
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:02,228
when I become the Sleeping Kogoro!

319
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,528
Either way, it's me all the same,

320
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,328
so everything's okay!

321
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:11,328
And about Conan, I wonder if he's okay?

322
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,828
Come to think of it, that glasses kid...

323
00:19:13,828 --> 00:19:15,928
Did he leave me here and head home or what?

324
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:19,928
Yes. After talking to Officer Takagi,

325
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:22,528
he went pale and dashed out of here.

326
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,628
I wonder what they were talking about?

327
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:27,828
I think I heard something about a pick-pocket.

328
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,828
He probably heard from Officer Takagi

329
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,028
that a TV program that he's been wanting to watch

330
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:34,628
was going to be aired tonight and fled home!

331
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:37,628
What? Why?

332
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:40,628
Because it's a thrilling pick-pocket movie.

333
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:42,528
Just kidding!

334
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:45,928
I've outdone myself again!

335
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:11,928
Something's strange about the victim who was pick-pocketed?

336
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,428
Yes. Do you remember?

337
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:19,128
The guy called Tohei Benzaki, one of the victims back then.

338
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,428
Yes. The person who became hostage together with Jodie

339
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:26,028
when the bank robbery occurred, right?

340
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,128
That's right.

341
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:29,628
Jodie said that his wife who came later back then,

342
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:34,228
taped her eyes and mouth with masking tape, didn't she?

343
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,728
However, it seems that the bank robber

344
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,028
made people who didn't have anybody accompanying them do the work.

345
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:41,028
Because the robber figured

346
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:43,428
that family members would be lenient with each other.

347
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:47,928
Okay, those with nobody accompanying you!

348
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:49,928
Stand where you are!

349
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,628
You guys come here to get the masking tape!

350
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:59,028
Cover the eyes, mouth and immobilize the hands

351
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,828
of those who didn't come alone with the masking tape!

352
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:03,128
Unless, you really don't know each other,

353
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:05,528
you may be lenient, you see!

354
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:07,128
There!

355
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:10,628
Of course, we'll be taking care of you guys later too!

356
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,828
Hey.

357
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:32,028
Excuse me, I'm going to tape you.

358
00:22:33,128 --> 00:22:38,028
If her husband Tohei was also a hostage of that crime back then,

359
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:41,028
it doesn't fall into place.

360
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,428
A pregnant lady would never take the risk of deliberately

361
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:47,528
going out of her way to cheat a bank robber.

362
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:51,428
And? Did you try contacting the couple?

363
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:52,528
Yes.

364
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:55,828
I went to his residence many times

365
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:58,128
but he denied any involvement saying,

366
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:03,328
"I've never been involved in any pick-pocket murder."

367
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:08,628
Moreover, that Mr. Benzaki is single and doesn't have a wife.

368
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:11,828
Much less, he says he doesn't know of any pregnant lady.

369
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:14,028
I really have no idea what's going on.

370
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:16,028
Don't tell me...

371
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,828
It can't be...

372
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:21,328
Morning sickness is the early symptoms of pregnancy, right?

373
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:25,528
Right. I have bad eyesight.

374
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:29,028
Then, the guy with the burn on his face

375
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,728
who was next to me back then was your boyfriend or something.

376
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:34,828
I saw him about 2 or 3 days ago.

377
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,028
Don't tell me...

378
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,128
Don't tell me...

379
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:54,328
"Next Episode" -Cool it. I'll be fine.

380
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,228
I'm still okay.

381
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,628
And just the two of you. Ran and you.

382
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:03,528
This is the place to show your true self.

383
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:12,528
So, all three can commit the crime.

384
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:13,928
No.

385
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:21,328
Next Conan, "The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 1)"

386
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:39,428
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,428
"Key to the basement"

388
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:42,828
That tomboy's showing up again?

389
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,628
And you're needed less and less.

390
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:46,628
Hey, Ran...
