1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.340
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.240
If there's an ocean, there are fish.

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.940
Like so, I happen to be at the scene of a crime.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.740
It all started when I got a job request from a woman bartender,

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.040
Yuzuki Fukui, who's in love with me,

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.940
and came to the pool bar where she works.

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.340
Her request was for me to solve a queer mystery.

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.940
In which during work, she would hear a popping sound

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.840
like that of a champagne bottle being opened

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.640
and then smell the fragrance of yuzu soon after that.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.140
When I was racking my brains trying to solve this mystery,

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.840
one of the four people who was sitting behind me

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.340
was suddenly killed.

14
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.040
The victim is Chikafumi Usuda, age 51.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.640
He seems to be the department head of some company.

16
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.340
He was killed by poisoning.

17
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.140
It seems that the perp used something like an eyeleteer,

18
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.440
laced the sharp tip of it with nerve poison

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.940
and poked it in behind his neck.

20
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.240
The suspects are the three who say

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.740
they were celebrating the victim's birthday at this shop.

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.340
Kensaku Hatsumura, age 31,

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.740
who was told to buy a billiard cue for Usuda's birthday.

24
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.540
Likewise, Monpei Kogure, age 28 was told to buy darts.

25
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.640
And the one who was told to buy a rare poster of Yoko Okino

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.440
along with a lot of film was Mika Kishiura, age 30.

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.840
Although the most suspicious were Kogure who brought the darts

28
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.440
and Kishiura who was crushing ice

29
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
for whiskey and water using the ice pick.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
So...

31
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.040
I guess I'll have to solve the case

32
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.840
without sleeping tonight.

33
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.940
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

34
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.840
are slashed by the light of deduction.

35
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540
A deduction show at Blue Parrot.

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.740
Expose the trick of the hidden murder weapon.

37
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.940
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.470
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 2)"

41
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.670
What?

42
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.370
There was no trace of poison being laced?

43
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.070
Not even on the darts or the ice pick?

44
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.770
No, sir. According to forensics,

45
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.370
neither poison nor luminol reaction was detected.

46
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.470
Of course the three were checked, weren't they?

47
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.570
Yes.

48
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.470
None of the three possessed poisoned bottles or bags.

49
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.270
I see.

50
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.070
What's going on? No murder weapon.

51
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.870
It's the same as the pick-pocket case the other day.

52
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.970
Talking about the pick-pocket case, Inspector...

53
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.270
Did you tell Jodie about the incident?

54
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.970
No. She's an outsider.

55
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.670
There's no need to tell her about it.

56
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.770
I guess so.

57
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.670
Officer Takagi.

58
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.570
-What incident is it? -What?

59
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.670
Well, the thing is...

60
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.770
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

61
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.070
We're going to search inside the shop once again.

62
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.470
Yes, sir!

63
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.570
I wonder what "the incident"

64
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.870
that Officer Takagi mentioned was about?

65
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.670
The thing that bothered me about that incident

66
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.770
was just that pregnant lady.

67
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.570
What's that?

68
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.070
Yuzuki.

69
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.870
What is it, Conan?

70
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.270
What's that hanging down from the ceiling?

71
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.770
That's a torn piece of braided tinsel.

72
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.770
A torn piece of braided tinsel?

73
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.170
Right! It was stuck to the ceiling with a thumbtack,

74
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.070
but when I pulled it in order to remove it, it tore.

75
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.270
There were customers who reserved this shop last week

76
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.270
that held a party here, you see.

77
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.070
The ceiling here is dark so it's not too conspicuous,

78
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.370
that's why I just left it as is.

79
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.170
But I guess it's quite visible?

80
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.470
Yes! When I talk to adults, I look up, you see.

81
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.970
I see.

82
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.770
But I guess since you're always looking up,

83
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.670
your attention isn't on the ground below, is it, Mr. Detective?

84
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.370
-What? -Look!

85
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.570
On the sole of Mr. Mouri's shoe.

86
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.170
There's gum stuck on it, isn't there?

87
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.070
When he bent over to the corpse the first time, it wasn't there.

88
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.770
I wonder where he stepped on it?

89
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.070
How about it? Did you find anything?

90
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.070
No, nothing, sir.

91
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.670
Don't move!

92
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.970
Pops, it seems you stepped on the evidence.

93
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.170
What?

94
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.870
Officer Takagi, remove it for him!

95
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.370
Yes, sir!

96
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.870
This is not gum but clay.

97
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.170
-Something's molded on it. -What?

98
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.770
It looks to be 4 mirror image alphabets, E P D H,

99
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.270
and on top of it, there's a protruded part.

100
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.370
If the letters EPDH are mirrored images,

101
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.370
then the correct line up would be HDPE.

102
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.570
High density polyethylene.

103
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.470
In other words, plastic?

104
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.470
And the protrusion was because

105
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.270
the part where the clay was stuck onto was dented.

106
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.270
Which means, it was attached to the bottom of that thing.

107
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.070
But why would clay be stuck on the bottom of something like that?

108
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.570
Well, well.

109
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.870
If things were as always, I would already be off work

110
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.570
and humming a tune taking a hot bath by now.

111
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.670
Taking a bath...

112
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.670
I see. So, that's the story.

113
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.670
The murder weapon didn't disappear at all.

114
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.870
The perp took advantage of that

115
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.370
and lifted off the murder weapon.

116
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.770
Out of visual range of the adults.

117
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.470
I got it, Inspector.

118
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.970
The perp who killed Mr. Chikafumi Usuda.

119
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.870
-What? -Really, Mr. Mouri?

120
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.170
Yes.

121
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.070
The perps are the customers who had it out with the victim.

122
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.370
Although they seem to have left already,

123
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.770
if they took the poisoned needle

124
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.370
that they used for committing the murder with them,

125
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.870
it's only natural that the murder weapon

126
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.670
can't be found inside the shop.

127
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.070
Rather, so you may want to think

128
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.670
but the fact isn't that way at all.

129
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.970
What? What on earth are you talking about?

130
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.470
Well, no. What I just said was...

131
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.170
It's him, the other me.

132
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.270
Detectives usually have another self within themselves

133
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.270
who can objectively analyze their own deductions,

134
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.670
but my other self always pops out at the worse time.

135
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.970
It seems that the inspector and the others can hear it too,

136
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.170
so it may look as if I'm actually saying it.

137
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.970
I really have no sense of doing anything of that sort.

138
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.970
I feel like some unidentified thing has taken over my body.

139
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.670
No, no. Rather than that, the problem is

140
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.370
the slight pain that runs through my neck after that.

141
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.470
Right, this is it.

142
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.870
And that intolerable and irresistible sleepiness that takes over.

143
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.870
This is probably the result of my brain cells working to the max.

144
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.770
Hey, Mr. Mouri!

145
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.570
I'm starting to like this sleepiness recently.

146
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.170
Why?

147
00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:01.128
Mr. Mouri...

148
00:10:01.128 --> 00:10:02.828
Mr. Mouri!

149
00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:11.128
Mr. Mouri, are you awake?

150
00:10:12.828 --> 00:10:15.428
I mean, everybody's gone home already!

151
00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:20.228
What about the case?

152
00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:22.228
Just what're you talking about?

153
00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:25.928
You just finished the Sleeping Kogoro Deduction Show!

154
00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:28.028
Right. And when I snap back to myself,

155
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.728
the case is solved.

156
00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:32.828
Well, I see through the truth,

157
00:10:32.828 --> 00:10:35.128
and relay it to the authorities.

158
00:10:35.128 --> 00:10:37.128
Since I use up whatever power is left in me,

159
00:10:37.128 --> 00:10:40.128
I don't remember a thing.

160
00:10:40.128 --> 00:10:43.928
So, the perp was the customer who had it out with the victim.

161
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.228
Huh? Didn't you mention that

162
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.628
a customer who just happened to have it out with the victim

163
00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:52.228
couldn't have so conveniently had a poison needle ready?

164
00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:54.028
Then, don't tell me that

165
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:56.928
the perp was among those three

166
00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:59.628
that work at the same company as the victim.

167
00:10:59.628 --> 00:11:01.028
Huh? Yes.

168
00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:03.228
How could that be?

169
00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:06.628
Because although they had what could be used as murder weapons,

170
00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:09.928
no poison or blood was found on anything!

171
00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:13.228
Are you all right?

172
00:11:13.228 --> 00:11:16.228
I mean, didn't you think it was impossible too, Yuzuki?

173
00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:17.428
What?

174
00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:20.428
So you were just testing

175
00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:24.228
if I really understood your deduction, weren't you?

176
00:11:24.228 --> 00:11:25.928
Yes, sort of.

177
00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:30.528
I was really convinced and I really understood!

178
00:11:30.528 --> 00:11:32.728
I had no idea that

179
00:11:32.728 --> 00:11:36.328
the perp had hidden the murder weapon in that manner.

180
00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.228
In that manner?

181
00:11:38.228 --> 00:11:42.628
The experiment you did with Conan's help was great, too!

182
00:11:42.628 --> 00:11:47.028
You asked Officer Takagi to go and buy a film case.

183
00:11:47.028 --> 00:11:49.828
Then after pouring about one-third of it with water,

184
00:11:49.828 --> 00:11:53.028
you shattered the carbonic bath tablets

185
00:11:53.028 --> 00:11:55.328
that you also asked him to buy for you into sugar cube size

186
00:11:55.328 --> 00:11:57.228
and put them in the case.

187
00:11:57.228 --> 00:12:01.928
Then you closed the lid of the film case turned the case upside down,

188
00:12:01.928 --> 00:12:04.728
placing it facing lid down on the table.

189
00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:08.028
Then, in about 2 and a half to 3 minutes...

190
00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:18.728
Like so.

191
00:12:20.028 --> 00:12:23.028
The so-called film case rocket.

192
00:12:23.028 --> 00:12:27.528
The foaming bath tablet causes carbonic acid gas.

193
00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:29.728
The gas the fills up inside the film case,

194
00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:34.328
pushes open the lid of the case like a rocket and flies up high.

195
00:12:36.428 --> 00:12:38.228
The fragrance of yuzu.

196
00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:41.728
Right. The perp must've used

197
00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:44.028
a carbonic bath tablet that smelled of yuzu.

198
00:12:44.028 --> 00:12:48.128
What about the popping sound that I heard 2 or 3 times before?

199
00:12:48.128 --> 00:12:51.928
The perp tried it out several times here.

200
00:12:51.928 --> 00:12:53.228
To test whether the murder weapon

201
00:12:53.228 --> 00:12:55.928
that was placed on top of the film case

202
00:12:55.928 --> 00:12:58.728
would poke into the ceiling of this shop after it was launched.

203
00:12:58.728 --> 00:13:01.328
He put the murder weapon on it?

204
00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:04.428
The murder weapon is an ice pick like item, you know?

205
00:13:04.428 --> 00:13:07.828
Something so heavy could never be placed on it.

206
00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:11.428
The tip of the steel dart is removable,

207
00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:13.328
and weighs approximately 18 grams.

208
00:13:13.328 --> 00:13:16.328
There should be no problem launching it.

209
00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:19.528
Moreover, the perp stuck clay onto the bottom of the case

210
00:13:19.528 --> 00:13:22.028
and fixed the tip of the dart onto it.

211
00:13:22.028 --> 00:13:27.028
A cylindrical poster was also used as a guide as well as to hide it.

212
00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:30.428
This way, even if it were to go slightly off track when launching,

213
00:13:30.428 --> 00:13:34.228
it would reach the ceiling without fail.

214
00:13:34.228 --> 00:13:36.728
Am I wrong in some way?

215
00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:39.528
The one who bought the darts

216
00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:42.428
as a birthday present for the victim...

217
00:13:42.428 --> 00:13:44.228
Mr. Monpei Kogure!

218
00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:48.328
If it were you,

219
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:51.328
you could have laced the tip of the dart with poison

220
00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.728
and put it back into the case.

221
00:13:53.728 --> 00:13:56.428
This trick of using the film case rocket

222
00:13:56.428 --> 00:14:00.428
could only have been set up by you who was near the poster.

223
00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:05.228
Mr. Kogure, probably, after the victim got wasted,

224
00:14:05.228 --> 00:14:08.428
deliberately lost when playing billiards or darts

225
00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:10.728
with the other two to get out of the game.

226
00:14:10.728 --> 00:14:12.828
After being left behind with the victim,

227
00:14:12.828 --> 00:14:15.228
he put on a pretense of covering him with a jacket or something

228
00:14:15.228 --> 00:14:17.428
and poked the poison laced tip of the dart

229
00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:20.128
into the neck of the victim.

230
00:14:20.128 --> 00:14:23.228
After removing the tip of the dart,

231
00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:28.628
he switched it with another dart tip that was prepared beforehand.

232
00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:30.328
The tip laced with poison

233
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.328
was fixed onto the bottom of the film case with clay.

234
00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:37.028
After hiding the murder weapon between his crotch or something,

235
00:14:37.028 --> 00:14:38.928
all he had to do later was distract the other two

236
00:14:38.928 --> 00:14:43.928
and set the film case rocket on the table.

237
00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:45.628
Right, by saying something like

238
00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:49.428
doesn't that customer look like some celebrity?

239
00:14:49.428 --> 00:14:53.228
That is, of course, after he ordered a bottle of champagne.

240
00:14:53.228 --> 00:14:54.728
Come to think of it, back then...

241
00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:58.028
Then how about another one of the first champagne that we drank?

242
00:14:58.028 --> 00:15:00.428
Yes! That was good.

243
00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:02.928
-What do you say? -Fine with me.

244
00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:06.028
Excuse me! A bottle of champagne, please!

245
00:15:06.028 --> 00:15:08.828
-Right away! -And three glasses, too!

246
00:15:08.828 --> 00:15:12.728
That person at the counter, isn't he Kogoro Mouri?

247
00:15:12.728 --> 00:15:16.528
No joke! You mean that renown detective?

248
00:15:16.528 --> 00:15:19.328
I somehow feel like I'm being watched.

249
00:15:19.328 --> 00:15:20.928
I want to take a picture of him!

250
00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:22.528
Maybe he's just a look alike?

251
00:15:22.528 --> 00:15:25.628
I guess so. I don't think he'd be such a drunkard.

252
00:15:27.228 --> 00:15:30.728
And to finish it off, you pulled out the cork of the champagne

253
00:15:30.728 --> 00:15:34.328
almost simultaneous to the sound of the rocket taking off.

254
00:15:34.328 --> 00:15:37.528
What's with this? It's really tight.

255
00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:40.428
Hey! Don't face it this way, you know!

256
00:15:40.428 --> 00:15:42.228
I know.

257
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:48.428
If you splash the champagne

258
00:15:48.428 --> 00:15:51.428
that bursts forth onto the poster after the launch,

259
00:15:51.428 --> 00:15:57.828
you can just wipe off the remains of the carbonic bath tablet.

260
00:15:57.828 --> 00:16:01.828
As proof of this, the wet part of the poster

261
00:16:01.828 --> 00:16:04.328
should smell like yuzu.

262
00:16:06.628 --> 00:16:08.428
True.

263
00:16:08.428 --> 00:16:13.528
But this poster was what Ms. Kishiura had bought, wasn't it?

264
00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:17.828
It seems that the victim repeatedly kept asking for it.

265
00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:21.228
If it turned out that she didn't buy the poster,

266
00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:25.228
he was probably going to prepare another poster anyway.

267
00:16:25.228 --> 00:16:29.028
If he gave the dart board to the victim beforehand,

268
00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:31.328
it's assumable that he would be asking for darts to go with it.

269
00:16:31.328 --> 00:16:33.028
And as for the film cases,

270
00:16:33.028 --> 00:16:36.328
if you know beforehand that he's going to be asking for

271
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.728
a lot of pictures to be taken for his blog,

272
00:16:38.728 --> 00:16:41.528
this is also presumable.

273
00:16:41.528 --> 00:16:43.328
Well, everything will be answered

274
00:16:43.328 --> 00:16:45.628
by that thing poked into the ceiling.

275
00:16:48.628 --> 00:16:51.828
That murder weapon over there.

276
00:16:53.328 --> 00:16:56.028
If it weren't for Mr. Kogure who bought the darts,

277
00:16:56.028 --> 00:16:59.928
it wouldn't be possible to prepare the same tips for the darts.

278
00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:03.228
But if the only thing poked in is the tip of the dart,

279
00:17:03.228 --> 00:17:05.028
the film case with the clay attached to it

280
00:17:05.028 --> 00:17:08.828
should also come falling somewhere, no?

281
00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:10.428
That's true.

282
00:17:10.428 --> 00:17:14.228
But back then, everyone is panicked

283
00:17:14.228 --> 00:17:16.628
because the important poster for the victim is wet with champagne.

284
00:17:16.628 --> 00:17:20.128
Even if it were to have dropped,

285
00:17:20.128 --> 00:17:23.728
it would only look as if he hurriedly wiped the table off.

286
00:17:23.728 --> 00:17:25.628
By the way, the clay on the film case peeled off

287
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.328
from the impact of the case falling to the floor

288
00:17:27.328 --> 00:17:30.128
and I happened to step on it.

289
00:17:30.128 --> 00:17:33.028
And the mirrored image of the alphabets HDPE

290
00:17:33.028 --> 00:17:35.228
were molded on that clay.

291
00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:37.028
Because that's what's usually

292
00:17:37.028 --> 00:17:39.928
indicated on the bottom of film cases.

293
00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:43.328
Then what about the pieces of carbonic bath tablets

294
00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:44.428
that were left on the table?

295
00:17:44.428 --> 00:17:48.228
He probably put it into the beer that he was drinking.

296
00:17:48.228 --> 00:17:50.728
Because foams look natural in beer.

297
00:17:50.728 --> 00:17:52.828
It'll completely dissolve.

298
00:17:52.828 --> 00:17:55.528
Well, his perfect crime

299
00:17:55.528 --> 00:17:58.528
thanks to the Sleeping Kogoro having been here

300
00:17:58.528 --> 00:18:01.428
has indeed vanished like the foams.

301
00:18:06.528 --> 00:18:09.728
I see. What a good line.

302
00:18:09.728 --> 00:18:12.328
You said that yourself, didn't you?

303
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.928
The inspector said that you don't remember a thing

304
00:18:16.928 --> 00:18:19.928
after you solve the case,

305
00:18:19.928 --> 00:18:21.928
but it was really true.

306
00:18:21.928 --> 00:18:23.928
Which means you don't even remember that the motive of the killer

307
00:18:23.928 --> 00:18:26.728
was to avenge the death of his colleague who committed suicide

308
00:18:26.728 --> 00:18:31.128
because of terrible power harassment from the department head?

309
00:18:31.128 --> 00:18:33.828
Is that right? Nothing what so ever.

310
00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:38.128
Gosh, you were really awesome, and yet...

311
00:18:38.128 --> 00:18:40.128
No, hold it.

312
00:18:40.128 --> 00:18:42.528
It's not possible that I don't remember a thing.

313
00:18:42.528 --> 00:18:46.528
Don't tell me that the one I thought was the other me

314
00:18:46.528 --> 00:18:50.228
was the one who is subconsciously asleep in me.

315
00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:54.428
"The real Kogoro Mouri" -The real me!

316
00:18:54.428 --> 00:18:56.428
I see!

317
00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.928
I normally save energy and accumulate my powers to be used

318
00:18:58.928 --> 00:19:02.228
when I become the Sleeping Kogoro!

319
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:05.528
Either way, it's me all the same,

320
00:19:05.528 --> 00:19:07.328
so everything's okay!

321
00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:11.328
And about Conan, I wonder if he's okay?

322
00:19:11.328 --> 00:19:13.828
Come to think of it, that glasses kid...

323
00:19:13.828 --> 00:19:15.928
Did he leave me here and head home or what?

324
00:19:15.928 --> 00:19:19.928
Yes. After talking to Officer Takagi,

325
00:19:19.928 --> 00:19:22.528
he went pale and dashed out of here.

326
00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.628
I wonder what they were talking about?

327
00:19:24.628 --> 00:19:27.828
I think I heard something about a pick-pocket.

328
00:19:27.828 --> 00:19:29.828
He probably heard from Officer Takagi

329
00:19:29.828 --> 00:19:31.028
that a TV program that he's been wanting to watch

330
00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:34.628
was going to be aired tonight and fled home!

331
00:19:34.628 --> 00:19:37.628
What? Why?

332
00:19:37.628 --> 00:19:40.628
Because it's a thrilling pick-pocket movie.

333
00:19:40.628 --> 00:19:42.528
Just kidding!

334
00:19:44.628 --> 00:19:45.928
I've outdone myself again!

335
00:21:09.828 --> 00:21:11.928
Something's strange about the victim who was pick-pocketed?

336
00:21:11.928 --> 00:21:14.428
Yes. Do you remember?

337
00:21:14.428 --> 00:21:19.128
The guy called Tohei Benzaki, one of the victims back then.

338
00:21:19.128 --> 00:21:22.428
Yes. The person who became hostage together with Jodie

339
00:21:22.428 --> 00:21:26.028
when the bank robbery occurred, right?

340
00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:27.128
That's right.

341
00:21:27.128 --> 00:21:29.628
Jodie said that his wife who came later back then,

342
00:21:29.628 --> 00:21:34.228
taped her eyes and mouth with masking tape, didn't she?

343
00:21:34.228 --> 00:21:36.728
However, it seems that the bank robber

344
00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:40.028
made people who didn't have anybody accompanying them do the work.

345
00:21:40.028 --> 00:21:41.028
Because the robber figured

346
00:21:41.028 --> 00:21:43.428
that family members would be lenient with each other.

347
00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:47.928
Okay, those with nobody accompanying you!

348
00:21:47.928 --> 00:21:49.928
Stand where you are!

349
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:55.628
You guys come here to get the masking tape!

350
00:21:55.628 --> 00:21:59.028
Cover the eyes, mouth and immobilize the hands

351
00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:01.828
of those who didn't come alone with the masking tape!

352
00:22:01.828 --> 00:22:03.128
Unless, you really don't know each other,

353
00:22:03.128 --> 00:22:05.528
you may be lenient, you see!

354
00:22:05.528 --> 00:22:07.128
There!

355
00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:10.628
Of course, we'll be taking care of you guys later too!

356
00:22:27.428 --> 00:22:29.828
Hey.

357
00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:32.028
Excuse me, I'm going to tape you.

358
00:22:33.128 --> 00:22:38.028
If her husband Tohei was also a hostage of that crime back then,

359
00:22:38.028 --> 00:22:41.028
it doesn't fall into place.

360
00:22:41.028 --> 00:22:44.428
A pregnant lady would never take the risk of deliberately

361
00:22:44.428 --> 00:22:47.528
going out of her way to cheat a bank robber.

362
00:22:47.528 --> 00:22:51.428
And? Did you try contacting the couple?

363
00:22:51.428 --> 00:22:52.528
Yes.

364
00:22:52.528 --> 00:22:55.828
I went to his residence many times

365
00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:58.128
but he denied any involvement saying,

366
00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:03.328
"I've never been involved in any pick-pocket murder."

367
00:23:04.128 --> 00:23:08.628
Moreover, that Mr. Benzaki is single and doesn't have a wife.

368
00:23:08.628 --> 00:23:11.828
Much less, he says he doesn't know of any pregnant lady.

369
00:23:11.828 --> 00:23:14.028
I really have no idea what's going on.

370
00:23:14.028 --> 00:23:16.028
Don't tell me...

371
00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:17.828
It can't be...

372
00:23:17.828 --> 00:23:21.328
Morning sickness is the early symptoms of pregnancy, right?

373
00:23:21.328 --> 00:23:25.528
Right. I have bad eyesight.

374
00:23:25.528 --> 00:23:29.028
Then, the guy with the burn on his face

375
00:23:29.028 --> 00:23:31.728
who was next to me back then was your boyfriend or something.

376
00:23:31.728 --> 00:23:34.828
I saw him about 2 or 3 days ago.

377
00:23:34.828 --> 00:23:36.028
Don't tell me...

378
00:23:44.528 --> 00:23:46.128
Don't tell me...

379
00:23:51.428 --> 00:23:54.328
"Next Episode" -Cool it. I'll be fine.

380
00:23:54.328 --> 00:23:56.228
I'm still okay.

381
00:23:58.228 --> 00:24:00.628
And just the two of you. Ran and you.

382
00:24:00.628 --> 00:24:03.528
This is the place to show your true self.

383
00:24:08.928 --> 00:24:12.528
So, all three can commit the crime.

384
00:24:12.528 --> 00:24:13.928
No.

385
00:24:16.028 --> 00:24:21.328
Next Conan, "The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 1)"

386
00:24:37.428 --> 00:24:39.428
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:39.428 --> 00:24:41.428
"Key to the basement"

388
00:24:41.428 --> 00:24:42.828
That tomboy's showing up again?

389
00:24:42.828 --> 00:24:44.628
And you're needed less and less.

390
00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:46.628
Hey, Ran...
