1
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:06,249
Hey, this is...

2
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:08,049
He's a perfect double.

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:12,849
But, why would you change your face to Shinichi's?

4
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,949
He called me out to that hut,

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,149
confined me there and after becoming me,

6
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:20,349
he was probably scheming to commit some sort of crime.

7
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,349
His intention was to probably annihilate I, Shinichi Kudo...

8
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:27,849
as a person, and from society too.

9
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:31,049
Annihilate you?

10
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,549
He pretended to have amnesia

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,849
so that he wouldn't have to answer anything

12
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:39,649
that my friends who he supposed would come along with me may ask.

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:41,649
He went into the lake naked and had a hoarse voice

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,749
as if having a cold for the same reason.

15
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,349
Although he could make himself look like me,

16
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,049
he couldn't copy my voice.

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,049
Neither did he know what kind of clothes I would be wearing.

18
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:59,949
Well, I too, when escaping from that hut fell into the lake,

19
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:03,449
and have a bit of a hoarse voice with a cold.

20
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,549
Then, the one who called the ambulance and police this morning

21
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,749
-right after the incident was... -Me.

22
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:12,849
I saw Mrs. Kawauchi and he come into this house,

23
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,049
so I prepared for the worse.

24
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,349
Then, why didn't you yourself rush inside and stop him?

25
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,949
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

26
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,849
Because when he came out of the house last night,

27
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,549
from the protrusion in the back of his clothes,

28
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,749
I was sure that he was armed with a gun.

29
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,649
I guess it can't be helped.

30
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:33,149
After all, "Failure means death"

31
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:35,749
was carved on the desk too.

32
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:36,749
Yes.

33
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:40,649
If he was ready to shoot a specific person,

34
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,849
maybe I could've stopped him.

35
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,549
If he had his mind made up to kill himself

36
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,349
as soon as he found out that his scheme didn't work,

37
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,949
the time I had to stop him was limited.

38
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:55,149
That's why I took the bullets out of Officer Shiroyama's gun

39
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,349
and scattered it before his eyes

40
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,549
to make him hesitate and putting him off guard.

41
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,549
Because he was probably planning to carry out his scheme

42
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,949
as soon as I appeared before him.

43
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,849
Isn't that right, Okuda?

44
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,449
Rather, Makoto Hinohara?

45
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:22,249
Makoto? You mean you're Makoto?

46
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,449
He sure is.

47
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:24,749
To do this much with plastic surgery

48
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:26,749
would cost a lot of time and money.

49
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:31,349
But, Makoto could do it because he got a lot of estate

50
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,149
and his whereabouts were unknown for six months.

51
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:41,549
If so, he would've hidden the gun in his own room in this house.

52
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,349
He assumed beforehand that they would bring him back here

53
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,349
to help him regain his memory.

54
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,649
He then tells everyone that he wants to be alone,

55
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:51,549
and that's when he retrieves the gun.

56
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,249
But, why, why did he have to stab the newspaper reporter?

57
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:58,349
He probably thought that she found out about everything

58
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,749
because of her remark last night.

59
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:03,449
Oh, my. What's with that look of yours?

60
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,449
Don't tell me that you thought I didn't realize either?

61
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:11,349
That you underwent plastic surgery to make yourself look like Kudo.

62
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,249
But, I don't understand.

63
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:16,149
When I came over to the house this morning,

64
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:20,849
why didn't you say that you stabbed Mrs. Kawauchi?

65
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,549
If you wanted to frame Kudo for the murder,

66
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,949
wouldn't that have been faster?

67
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:33,749
I was testing you detectives out.

68
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,249
I wanted to see what kind of deduction

69
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,049
you'd come up with after the evidence all pointed

70
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,349
to Shinichi Kudo being the murderer.

71
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,349
Well, it seems they saw you through completely.

72
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,749
Then, what about the incident that occurred a year ago?

73
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,749
What's with Shinichi Kudo who made a stupid deduction

74
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,149
saying that Mr. Hinohara committed forced double suicide

75
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:03,249
when a robber made away with the valuables and murdered them?

76
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:06,449
What about him?

77
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,549
Kudo didn't make a mistake.

78
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,549
That was a forced double suicide.

79
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:16,649
What?

80
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,749
The murder weapon of the killer,

81
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:19,949
Mrs. Hinohara's jewelry,

82
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,649
as well as her valuable Nioh statue were taken, you know?

83
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:25,749
It's more than obvious that the killer took it with him.

84
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,049
The lake...

85
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:31,149
After Mr. Hinohara stabbed his wife,

86
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:35,949
he sunk the murder weapon together with the jewelry into the lake.

87
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,849
What're you talking about?

88
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,849
It's close to 30 meters from this house to the lake.

89
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,249
How would the culprit be able to take all that

90
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,549
to the lake without leaving footprints behind?

91
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,849
Not only the murder weapon and the jewelry,

92
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,049
but the strings for the gold medals

93
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,149
and the loops for quoits are also gone.

94
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,149
Quoits?

95
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,349
Mr. Hinohara's son Daiki was saying, remember?

96
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,249
That his father was good at quoits

97
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,049
and always played a perfect game, right?

98
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:04,449
The scores that are written on the target of quoits

99
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,049
are 10 points, 5 points, 2 points.

100
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,949
So, if he wants to play a perfect game scoring 100 points,

101
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,149
he needs 10 quoits, but there were only 9.

102
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:17,649
Besides, one pair of the Nioh statue was left untouched

103
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,449
and taking into consideration

104
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,449
that Mr. Hinohara used to be a player of field sports,

105
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,049
the answer is obvious.

106
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,449
Hammer throwing.

107
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,849
He packed the Nioh statue that he used for weight together

108
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,849
with the murder weapon, shoes and jewelry into a bag,

109
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,449
and used the quoit as a handle

110
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,349
by tying on the string of medal onto the package.

111
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,449
He did this all to throw the bag into the lake from the veranda

112
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,549
as he would do when hammer throwing.

113
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:47,949
I see.

114
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,449
He left one Nion statue behind

115
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,549
because putting both in the bag would make it too heavy

116
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:56,149
and the bag wouldn't reach the lake.

117
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,749
Ridiculous.

118
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,649
The bag would've never made it because of resistance from the wind.

119
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,549
No, the bag made it.

120
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,849
The bag, string and quoits

121
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,749
have already been retrieved from the lake.

122
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:12,249
Of course on the blade of the murder weapon knife,

123
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:15,549
Mrs. Hinohara's blood was found and on the handle of the knife,

124
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,849
Mr. Hinohara's fingerprints were found.

125
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,849
There's no mistake that it was a forced double suicide

126
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,249
committed by Mr. Hinohara.

127
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,649
Not true.

128
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,549
He probably made it look like the doings of an armed robber

129
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:32,249
so that his son, Daiki wouldn't realize what happened.

130
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:37,349
That's a lie! Mr. Hinohara who was cheerful and kind man

131
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,249
would never commit forced double suicide with his wife.

132
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,049
Besides the Mr. Hinohara's cancer was found to be benign

133
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,349
and it turned out that the motive for his murderous act

134
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,849
which was because he was depressed over it was also a lie.

135
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,749
After the doctor told him about his cancer.

136
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:53,249
Another problem came into the light.

137
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:56,149
After the physical exam,

138
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,849
it turned out that Mr. Hinohara's blood type was...

139
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,849
in fact, AB.

140
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,849
Hey, wait!

141
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,649
I thought I heard that Mr. Hinohara's family

142
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,649
was a cheerful blood type O family.

143
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:12,649
Yes.

144
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,949
According to Mendel's Law of Heredity,

145
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,049
a child with blood type O is not born

146
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,949
from parents whose blood type is AB and O.

147
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,349
In other words,

148
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,349
Daiki is not Mr. Hinohara's son.

149
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,849
Oh no.

150
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,649
My god.

151
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,949
Don't lie.

152
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,849
I see.

153
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:41,749
If that was his motive for committing the murder,

154
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,649
it's something that people would want to keep secret.

155
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,449
Yes. That's why it was announced

156
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,249
that the motive for him committing the murder

157
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,149
was because he was told he had cancer.

158
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,249
But if so, why didn't he tell me about it?

159
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,549
I was a part of the family and yet!

160
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,249
I already told you why.

161
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,649
Because Mr. Kudo told me to.

162
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,449
Don't dare tell anybody.

163
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,049
But, please do tell Makoto about this.

164
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,349
When? Where did you tell me this?

165
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:18,249
Here, the night after Mr. Kudo finished investigating the case and left.

166
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,149
But, come to think of it.

167
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:25,649
The truth about Mr. Hinohara having committed forced double suicide

168
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,249
that I told you about first was so shocking

169
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,849
that you may not have been listening to what I was saying.

170
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,749
No.

171
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,349
It's not possible.

172
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,349
What the heck is wrong with me?

173
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,349
What the heck did I go and change my face for?

174
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,049
What the heck?

175
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:03,149
A tragedy brought about by a much too unfortunate coincidence.

176
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:06,549
Seeing my face breaking out in tears before me,

177
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,849
I thought that...

178
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,949
I can't ever forget this face.

179
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,749
That I should engraved it deep inside of me.

180
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:29,049
So that guy called Makoto was Death.

181
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:32,449
Yes. He was the 2nd one though.

182
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:33,649
The second one?

183
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,549
The first was his father.

184
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,849
In order to prevent the children of the village

185
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,649
from going through the same misfortune as his daughter

186
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:43,449
who had died in the forest.

187
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,249
He built a hut in the forest

188
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,349
and lived in it as Death,

189
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:51,149
to scare and keep people from entering the forest.

190
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,649
He did so until he fell ill and died 3 years ago.

191
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:58,249
So the stone that was placed near the hut was...

192
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:01,549
Yes. It's Makoto's father's grave.

193
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,649
How come you know so much?

194
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,949
When I came here a year ago,

195
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:10,049
there was another incident other than this case happening.

196
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:13,049
Mrs. Kawauchi's daughter who had come here on an interview

197
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,549
went into the forest and never came back.

198
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,849
I heard about it from the person at the inn.

199
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:21,649
That Mrs. Kawauchi also went inside the forest to look for her.

200
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,249
Yes, just when I was about to go to look for her too,

201
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,249
her daughter came out of the forest on her own.

202
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:30,749
She said that Death found her in the forest

203
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:31,749
and she was chased around.

204
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:34,049
She was so scared that she kept running around

205
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,849
until she found herself outside the forest.

206
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,849
I figured I had to solve this mystery

207
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:40,449
before taking care of the murder case,

208
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:41,649
so I went into the forest.

209
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,249
I found Death, went after him and found that hut.

210
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:50,349
Then, I ran into Makoto who was dressed as Death.

211
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,849
I see.

212
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:55,949
So, you borrowed the outfit that you found in that hut this time.

213
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,149
Yes.

214
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,449
I did so because I had no choice after I fell into the lake

215
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:00,549
and my clothes got wet.

216
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,049
Besides, with these clothes on everybody fled from me too,

217
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,349
so it turned out to be a great way to hide my face.

218
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,249
But I feel sorry for Makoto.

219
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,949
He'll be fine.

220
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:18,149
It seems that Mrs. Kawauchi wasn't that badly hurt

221
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:22,049
as we thought she was at first either.

222
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,349
When she finds out who had saved her daughter's life a year ago,

223
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:27,749
she will be grateful to Death.

224
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:35,949
Shinichi?

225
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,949
What's the matter, Shinichi?

226
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,649
This is?

227
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:46,349
Shinichi? What's the wrong?

228
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,749
Oh no, it's come.

229
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,149
Oh no. It's almost 24 hours.

230
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,949
I've got to take Shinichi away from everybody quick.

231
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,249
I almost forgot.

232
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:01,049
The Inspector had asked Kudo and I to come

233
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,149
and tell him more in detail about the case.

234
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,849
So you guys go on ahead by car and...

235
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:07,849
No.

236
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,349
I'll go with you too.

237
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,949
I have things that...

238
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,849
I want to ask you too, Shinichi.

239
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,949
Lots and lots of things too!

240
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,049
Ran...

241
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:26,749
Shinichi?

242
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:27,749
Kudo?

243
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:28,949
Are you all right?

244
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,849
My body's... my body's hot...

245
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,649
Oh no. He's really hot.

246
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,549
If things go as is, I'm going to return to a kid.

247
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,349
I'll transform back to Conan again.

248
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:44,549
I can't afford to go back

249
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,149
to how was in front of her.

250
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:50,549
It's his cold, his cold.

251
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,049
Remember he said he fell into the lake?

252
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,849
The cold he had back then got worse.

253
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,449
I guess so, but...

254
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,849
He seems to be suffering abnormally.

255
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,349
What?

256
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,549
You want to go to the john and let out what you have to?

257
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,049
I see! I see!

258
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,449
Okay, I'll go take Shinichi to the toilet at the inn,

259
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:12,149
so Kazuha would you bring my bag and come along.

260
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,249
Why do I have to take your bag?

261
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:16,249
Change of clothes, I need change of clothes!

262
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,849
Kudo is sweating profusely

263
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,949
so we can't keep him in Death's outfit forever, can we?

264
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:22,949
So, okay? Bring it for me, will you?

265
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:25,649
"Okuho Inn"

266
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:28,049
Twenty four hours?

267
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,549
Are you serious?

268
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,449
Yes. The little lady at doctor's place said so.

269
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,749
The drug only stays effective for 24 hours.

270
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:41,949
She told me to bring you back to her before the time is up.

271
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:44,749
Isn't it almost time?

272
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,349
If you do get small again,

273
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:49,149
go inside this bag.

274
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:55,049
Then, I'll somehow get you out of here safely.

275
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,749
You can count on me.

276
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,349
Yes.

277
00:13:58,349 --> 00:13:59,549
Heiji?

278
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:00,649
Kazuha?

279
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,049
What're you sneaking around about?

280
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,849
Stupid, don't come in.

281
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:06,449
This is the men's room.

282
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,749
But, we're worried about Shinichi.

283
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,149
We brought a doctor that we found in the neighborhood along.

284
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,149
He's fine. He's fine.

285
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,149
Besides, I just gave him some cold medicine now.

286
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,449
What kind of medicine did you give him?

287
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:20,149
Well, it's a secret potion

288
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,649
that has been handed down in my family for generations.

289
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,049
Darn it.

290
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,649
It always turns out like this.

291
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,849
It always turns out like this!

292
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:41,149
I always go back being Conan

293
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,949
without being able to say anything to her.

294
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,949
Am I going to have to start all over again?

295
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,299
Shoots.

296
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,699
I'm Conan again.

297
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:14,599
Shinichi? What's wrong?

298
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,299
Hey, don't!

299
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,499
Shinichi?

300
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,499
Hey, Shinichi?

301
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:23,799
I've to hide in the bag quick.

302
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,699
Shinichi.

303
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,299
Well, so you see...

304
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,899
Or, Ran will find out about me.

305
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,399
Shinichi.

306
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,699
Shinichi!

307
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,599
Oh no.

308
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,199
The toilet next door?

309
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,499
Who is it?

310
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,499
Shinichi, please answer me.

311
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,499
I'm telling you he's okay.

312
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,599
How can he be okay screaming like that?

313
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,699
Get out of my way.

314
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,599
Please, Heiji!

315
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:04,799
No... Don't...

316
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,099
You idiot.

317
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,199
Kudo?

318
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,299
Shinichi...

319
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,999
What is it? Stop bugging me.

320
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,899
The least you can do is give me peace using the toilet.

321
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,999
How're you feeling?

322
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,199
Yes, since I let everything out,

323
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,599
I'm feeling much better.

324
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,099
It looks like your fever came down too.

325
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,099
See?

326
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,199
I'm glad. I was really worried.

327
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,499
Shall we head on home then.

328
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:45,799
Don't we have to go to the police

329
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,199
and give them the details of the case?

330
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,499
Well, we can do that after we get home.

331
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,999
True. And just to be on the safe side,

332
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:55,499
you'd better go to the hospital too.

333
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:56,599
Yes.

334
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,499
Okay, let's head home then.

335
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:03,199
I'm very sorry, after you came all this way.

336
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,999
Not at all.

337
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:08,599
Kudo, what the heck is going on?

338
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,399
I'll tell you later.

339
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,799
Wait, Kudo.

340
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,599
We seem to have somehow made it through.

341
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,899
He seems to have regained his memory too.

342
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,199
Yes. What a life saver.

343
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:34,699
Thank god you remembered the name of the inn they were staying at.

344
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:36,099
Good gracious, too, that we were able to assume

345
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:38,299
that if he was cornered,

346
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,199
he would flee into the toilet of the inn.

347
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,499
Ai?

348
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,499
How'd you get here?

349
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,399
I've no time to explain.

350
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,599
Just drink this right away.

351
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,299
This is, don't tell me...

352
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:01,499
Yes, it's the prototype of the antidote of the APTX 4869

353
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,799
that shrunk your body.

354
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,799
It's the same medicine you drank yesterday.

355
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,699
Then, it'll keep for 24 hours?

356
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,599
Don't be silly.

357
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,099
Just as when you frequently keep drinking the same medicine,

358
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,399
the effectiveness wears off.

359
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:19,199
Your body builds up resistance to the medicine,

360
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,899
and by taking it repeatedly,

361
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,699
the length of time the drug remains effective shortens too.

362
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:25,999
If you want to continue hiding your true identity,

363
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,499
you'll have get out of their sight

364
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:30,099
before the effect of the drug wears off

365
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,799
and go back to being Conan Edogawa.

366
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,199
And?

367
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:48,899
What is it that you want to ask me?

368
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:56,199
I just wanted to say thank you for treating my wounds.

369
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,799
You're the one who treated them, right?

370
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:03,299
Yes. Since there just happened to be a first aid kit in that mountain.

371
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,799
You didn't look, did you?

372
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,499
You know when you were treating me...

373
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,099
When I was wrapping the bandage around your thighs,

374
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,999
I saw the white stuff.

375
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,599
So you did look after all!

376
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,899
How dare you!

377
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:22,899
You idiot!

378
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,899
I didn't look at it because I wanted to,

379
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,599
I just happened to see it, you get?

380
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,199
Well, I'm so sorry!

381
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,299
That I showed you what you didn't want to see!

382
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,499
Ran.

383
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,199
Would you like to change seats with me?

384
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,799
I think it'll make it easier for both of you to talk.

385
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,899
It's okay, Kazuha, stay right there.

386
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:44,099
I'm going to throw that guy over my shoulder after we get home.

387
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,399
Give me a break.

388
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,899
No. This isn't how it's suppose to turn out.

389
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,499
The thing I wanted to ask Shinichi about was...

390
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,899
The thing I really wanted to confirm was...

391
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,099
Ran.

392
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:11,999
Officer Sato and Takagi. What's up?

393
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,699
I went to the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department!

394
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,299
And, since I finished doing what I had to do,

395
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,799
I'm having my driver drive me home.

396
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,999
I'm no more than a driver.

397
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,499
What about you people?

398
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:25,599
Did you have any case to solve or something, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?

399
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,199
Yes. Well, sort of.

400
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:31,899
Really? Well, excuse us, since we're in a rush.

401
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,299
Tell us about the case some other day then!

402
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,199
Since that incident is big news,

403
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,699
as long as they read tomorrow's papers they'll find out about it

404
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:40,799
without us telling them about it.

405
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,899
No, I don't think it'll be in the papers.

406
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,199
Nobody died as a result, and besides,

407
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,399
the culprit is still a juvenile.

408
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,099
Neither his name nor picture will be publicized.

409
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,799
It seems that the newspaper reporter lady who was stabbed,

410
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,599
also said that she won't write about it.

411
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:01,999
You were sure lucky, Kudo.

412
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,699
What's with that car?

413
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:13,199
It's moving along scraping its body against the guardrail.

414
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:20,699
Maybe he's sleeping at the wheels?

415
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,599
If we leave it as is, there's sure to be a big accident.

416
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:33,399
Hey, get up!

417
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,999
Hey, you!

418
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,199
Hey, something's not right.

419
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,199
Get this car in front of that car.

420
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,199
Hey! In front, don't tell me that...

421
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,399
When you go up front slow down little by little.

422
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:59,199
Idiot! If I do that, the rental car will...

423
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,599
Never mind, just hurry.

424
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,399
Gunpei? Gunpei?

425
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,599
Hey, wait. Don't touch him.

426
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,899
Please step back.

427
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:30,499
Who're you people?

428
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,499
-No good. -He's not breathing anymore.

429
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:38,299
Look, Kudo.

430
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,199
There's hemorrhaging under his eyes.

431
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:43,799
Don't tell me that this is...

432
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,499
a rope mark.

433
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,699
Kudo, this is...

434
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,299
Hey!

435
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,699
What's wrong?

436
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:56,799
Ran. There's a toll gate a kilometer from here.

437
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,499
Call Officer Sato and have them block it off.

438
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:00,899
Why?

439
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:04,399
The driver of this car is dead.

440
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:05,999
He was strangled.

441
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,099
Strangled?

442
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,499
Yes.

443
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:15,499
In this moving car that's locked.

444
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,499
There are only three suspicious cars here.

445
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,899
He's leaving.

446
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:56,599
Shinichi's going to leave again.

447
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,099
You're not the only one.

448
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,499
I'm the one who have things

449
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,399
I want to ask you as well as tell you,

450
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,499
So, wait, okay?

451
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:10,499
No joke. It's already come.

452
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:16,181
Next Conan, "The Real Question".
