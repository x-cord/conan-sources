1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.240
Hey, Shinichi.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.340
Do you think that Mrs. Wakamatsu is the culprit too?

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.840
Yeah. I was positive.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.140
Until I went into that study where she was found dead.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.740
Me, too.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.340
It's hard to believe that a person who is contemplating suicide

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.940
would ask for tea to be served again or use eye drops.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.940
Moreover, the signature on the contract was only half written,

9
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.140
and the cap of the fountain pen wasn't closed either.

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.440
Yeah.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.540
It's as if a ghost who came in here

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.740
without anybody noticing.

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.040
Poisoned her to death while she was signing her name.

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.340
Yeah.

15
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.640
Like the one who sent the weird letter to you...

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.140
The warped entity that cannot be seen normally.

17
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.540
If all cases were men,

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240
all hidden mysteries are women.

19
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.940
Don't let what you see deceive you.

20
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.740
The trick that the real culprit used.

21
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:58.421
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Illusion)"

25
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:03.321
But nobody came inside the study until we came.

26
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:06.321
And even if someone were to give Mrs. Wakamatsu orders over the phone

27
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:08.621
wanting to frame her.

28
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.521
The four suspects were undergoing voluntary on site investigation,

29
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:14.021
so they couldn't have done anything like that.

30
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.921
And those slippers with poison on them...

31
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:20.321
If somebody was planning to frame her,

32
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.121
the slippers would have had to been switched somewhere.

33
00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:25.021
It would be impossible to do something like that

34
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:27.921
without being suspected?

35
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:29.521
What's wrong?

36
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.721
What's with these slippers?

37
00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:38.221
They're Kazuha's!

38
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:40.521
Since there are slippers inside for restroom use,

39
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.321
you'd normally leave yours outside.

40
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:44.121
That's right! The restroom!

41
00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:46.121
It's possible to switch slippers here!

42
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:48.921
What's going on?

43
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:51.321
Why are all of you in front of the bathroom that I'm using?

44
00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:53.221
Kazuha. You used the restroom

45
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:54.821
right after you came to this house, didn't you?

46
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:56.521
Huh? Yeah.

47
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:59.321
And, when you came to the living room where we waiting, you said,

48
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:02.321
"The restroom was so crowded that I had a hard time." Didn't you?

49
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.921
Yeah.

50
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:07.421
I went to the restroom then, too.

51
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.521
Then, didn't Mrs. Wakamatsu use the restroom back then too?

52
00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:12.021
No.

53
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:15.021
The person who was in the restroom before us was...

54
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.321
Ikuro!

55
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.321
He went towards the living room as soon as he came out.

56
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.121
I heard the voice of Managing Director Shiina

57
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.921
ask us if we bought baumkuchen.

58
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.421
-Is that true? -Yeah.

59
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.021
While wiping his hands...

60
00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:31.921
He was in high spirits.

61
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:35.821
If so, the poison that was on the door knob of Ikuro's room was...

62
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:37.121
Foul play!

63
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:40.221
If so, there should be something after all.

64
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:44.521
A way to make only Ikuro pick up the poison baumkuchen.

65
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:45.721
But, back then,

66
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:49.021
there were to pieces of baumkuchen on the tray!

67
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.821
How was he directed to pick up a certain piece of baumkuchen

68
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.021
when the pieces were both the same size and same shape?

69
00:04:54.921 --> 00:04:57.621
I hate to say this at a time like this.

70
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:00.521
-But I'm getting hungry. -Yeah.

71
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.421
Talking about baumkuchen is making me want to eat fishcake.

72
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:07.021
Huh? Why fishcake?

73
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:08.621
The shape, kind of looks alike!

74
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:11.421
They're both somewhat arched, see...

75
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:12.621
I get it!

76
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.821
An eye for an eye.

77
00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:21.321
If so, it's understandable why Mrs. Wakamatsu was killed.

78
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:25.021
A similar method of doing it is highly likely!

79
00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:27.021
Hey.

80
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:30.321
Strange.

81
00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:34.221
Dad said that the case was already closed and yet...

82
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:36.421
No, it's not closed yet.

83
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:39.221
When Heiji turns the brim of his cap to the front,

84
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.121
the investigation's still on!

85
00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:42.821
Huh? Really?

86
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:46.021
Right! And when he turns the brim of his cap to the back,

87
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:47.521
it means switch off!

88
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:50.121
It's my turn, that is!

89
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:56.921
Before Mrs. Wakamatsu passed away,

90
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:59.721
she was looking at the design of these letters?

91
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.621
Yeah. There seems to have been about 50 patterns all together,

92
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:05.721
and she seems to have been trying to choose

93
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.721
the good ones with Mr. Shiina and the others.

94
00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:11.321
I'm sure that you've already know what went on after this.

95
00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.121
While she was looking through them,

96
00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:15.921
it seemed that her eyes got exhausted,

97
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.521
so it seems Mr. Fujinami gave her eye drops.

98
00:06:18.521 --> 00:06:21.121
If I remember correctly, right after that,

99
00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:23.421
the housekeeper brought tea that she newly made.

100
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.221
Soon afterwards, Inspector and I came in,

101
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.121
announced that we would be holding a voluntary on site investigation

102
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.621
and came to get you all.

103
00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:32.421
But Mrs. Wakamatsu never once went near the baumkuchen,

104
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:34.221
so it was concluded that it would be okay for her to remain here.

105
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.621
Ms. Satake then asked her to sign

106
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:39.121
and stamp the contract while she was waiting.

107
00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:42.921
And Mr. Shiina lent her his bronze fountain pen.

108
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.421
That's how things went, correct?

109
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:49.221
-Bronze? -Yeah.

110
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:50.921
It seems he received it from the president

111
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:53.021
in celebration for his 30th anniversary working at the company.

112
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:54.321
He also mentioned that

113
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:58.621
the other employers were given bronze wristwatches.

114
00:06:58.621 --> 00:06:59.921
During the interrogation,

115
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:04.121
Mr. Fujinami and Ms. Satake were wearing something like that.

116
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:06.921
I think what they were wearing was the wristwatch they were given.

117
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:09.821
It's about time we leave!

118
00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:12.521
We'll continue investigations again tomorrow!

119
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:14.121
Yes, sir!

120
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:16.321
Did that explanation suffice?

121
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:18.621
Yeah, couldn't ask for more!

122
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:21.721
I've figured out who the culprit is

123
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:24.121
as well as the trick with the explanation now, but...

124
00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:26.121
There's no proof!

125
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:29.821
See, you later then.

126
00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:32.921
We'll come back for another interrogation.

127
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:34.621
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:42.321
It's finally over. My throat is parched.

129
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:46.021
You haven't even taken a sip of tea, after all.

130
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:48.421
Then, would you like to have some Oolong tea that I bought

131
00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:50.321
when I went to buy the soy sauce?

132
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:53.221
Poison couldn't possibly be inserted in a PET bottle, right?

133
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:07.521
No joke! It's already after 01:00?

134
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.921
Oh, no. I missed the last train?

135
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:12.621
Then, why don't you have Mr. Fujinami

136
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:14.921
drive you home together with me?

137
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:18.021
But she lives opposite from where your house is, doesn't she?

138
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.721
I guess so.

139
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:22.421
Would you like to spend the night at my apartment then?

140
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:24.121
It's pretty close from here.

141
00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:26.021
All right.

142
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:30.021
It seems that we'll finally get a normal look at things.

143
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:31.721
Yeah.

144
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:36.421
Of the warped entity that we humans created from our own imagination

145
00:08:36.421 --> 00:08:38.721
the proof of it!

146
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:43.021
Hey... Are you serious?

147
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:46.321
That you've figured out who killed that stupid son.

148
00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:48.421
Yeah! We've figured out exactly

149
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:52.621
how that culprit made Ikuro eat the poison baumkuchen!

150
00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:55.921
But, didn't the vice-president do it?

151
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:59.821
Right. The vice-president sprinkled poison powder

152
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.621
on the door knob of Ikuro's room,

153
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:04.221
and Ikuro ate the baumkuchen with his hand

154
00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:07.421
that had poison on it, wasn't that the story?

155
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:10.421
Besides you also said that poison was detected

156
00:09:10.421 --> 00:09:12.821
from the slippers that she was wearing, too!

157
00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:16.021
The poison spilled on the slippers

158
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.921
when she sprinkled poison powder on the doorknob, right?

159
00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:19.521
That was to throw us off!

160
00:09:19.521 --> 00:09:21.421
Throw off?

161
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.621
Right.

162
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.621
It was a preparatory move to frame her.

163
00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:29.021
This case was made to end when she killed herself.

164
00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:31.321
Are you saying that Mrs. Wakamatsu cause of death

165
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.921
was homicide and not suicide, then?

166
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:34.121
Yeah.

167
00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:36.221
I'm sure the culprit is one and the same person!

168
00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:39.521
But, where do you have proof of this?

169
00:09:39.521 --> 00:09:43.521
Ikuro washed his hands in the restroom

170
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:46.021
right before he picked up the baumkuchen!

171
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:48.521
Even if poison got on his hands before he left the room,

172
00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:50.021
wouldn't it come off?

173
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:52.521
-Don't you think so? -Yep.

174
00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:55.121
He wiped his hands using a handkerchief, too.

175
00:09:55.121 --> 00:09:58.421
But it not an easy task to make Mrs. Wakamatsu

176
00:09:58.421 --> 00:09:59.821
wear the slippers with poison on them, isn't it?

177
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:01.421
The restroom!

178
00:10:01.421 --> 00:10:05.421
The slippers were switched while she was using the restroom!

179
00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:07.921
The slippers that she was wearing were left outside the restroom

180
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:09.221
while she was in the toilet,

181
00:10:09.221 --> 00:10:11.421
so they were switched with the ones with poison!

182
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:13.721
If so, how was the stupid son made

183
00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:16.821
to pick up the poisoned baumkuchen?

184
00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:20.821
If the poison wasn't on Ikuro's hands to begin with,

185
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:23.621
how else could...

186
00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:26.021
That's easy!

187
00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:29.821
It was placed so that Ikuro who is greedy when it comes to food

188
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.421
would naturally pick it up!

189
00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:33.321
More so, if he was hungry!

190
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:37.321
Idiot! The pieces of baumkuchen then were cut

191
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.321
and divided into eight even pieces and were all exactly the same size!

192
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:41.721
Changing how you place the pieces

193
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:43.721
wouldn't have done much to change anything at all!

194
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:46.821
Then, you go and try it, Pops!

195
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:50.821
We placed two pieces on the tray just like the culprit,

196
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:54.021
so acting just as starved as Ikuro might've been!

197
00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:56.321
Starved, come on...

198
00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:01.721
What's this?

199
00:11:10.313 --> 00:11:12.513
Hey, hold it!

200
00:11:12.513 --> 00:11:16.513
It's obvious that the one on the other side is bigger!

201
00:11:16.513 --> 00:11:18.513
Huh? True!

202
00:11:18.513 --> 00:11:21.013
In this case, anyone who's hungry

203
00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:24.113
would definitely pick the one up on the one farther beyond.

204
00:11:24.113 --> 00:11:25.513
Like I said a while ago,

205
00:11:25.513 --> 00:11:28.013
the size of the pieces of baumkuchen were exactly the same.

206
00:11:28.013 --> 00:11:29.613
They're exactly the same.

207
00:11:29.613 --> 00:11:31.113
We used the pieces of baumkuchen that you the police

208
00:11:31.113 --> 00:11:34.013
used to carry out the voluntary on site investigation

209
00:11:34.013 --> 00:11:36.113
a while ago, you know.

210
00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:37.513
-What? -What?

211
00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:39.213
Don't be ridiculous!

212
00:11:39.213 --> 00:11:41.913
If you put one on top of the other, it's this big...

213
00:11:43.213 --> 00:11:45.613
They're exactly the same size!

214
00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:47.513
What's going on?

215
00:11:47.513 --> 00:11:50.313
Jastrow effect!

216
00:11:50.313 --> 00:11:52.913
When you compare the size of things,

217
00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:55.313
people have a tendency to naturally compare

218
00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:57.513
the length of the adjoining pieces nearest themselves!

219
00:11:57.513 --> 00:12:02.213
So, if arched pieces like baumkuchen are placed in rows,

220
00:12:02.213 --> 00:12:05.313
people tend to compare the short and long sides.

221
00:12:05.313 --> 00:12:06.813
Therefore, although the pieces are all the same size,

222
00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:08.313
people are deceived by the optical illusion

223
00:12:08.313 --> 00:12:10.313
that the ones beyond are bigger!

224
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.213
-Right, Heiji? -Yeah!

225
00:12:13.213 --> 00:12:17.213
It's an optical illusion that a psychologist named Jastrow discovered

226
00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:18.613
more than 100 years ago!

227
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:23.513
I see. So the culprit placed the poisoned piece

228
00:12:23.513 --> 00:12:25.713
in a position where it would larger to make Ikuro pick it up!

229
00:12:25.713 --> 00:12:27.713
But if this was done,

230
00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:31.613
the housekeeper Ms. Yonehara and Secretary Ms. Satake

231
00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:35.213
who cut and placed the pieces of baumkuchen on the plates

232
00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.913
and the ones who were standing near the tray

233
00:12:37.913 --> 00:12:39.813
that the pieces of baumkuchen were on...

234
00:12:39.813 --> 00:12:42.113
Chief Designer Mr. Fujinami

235
00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:44.113
and Managing Director Mr. Shiina, all four of them

236
00:12:44.113 --> 00:12:46.513
could've secretly done it, no?

237
00:12:46.513 --> 00:12:49.113
But only one among them

238
00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:52.013
could've poisoned Mrs. Wakamatsu to death.

239
00:12:52.013 --> 00:12:55.613
Let's go to the study where she was murdered then!

240
00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.613
What the heck's going on?

241
00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:03.613
I thought that unraveling the mystery was going to begin

242
00:13:03.613 --> 00:13:06.113
and yet we're suddenly shown something like this.

243
00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:07.413
Watch closely!

244
00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:09.313
Because there are at least 50 patterns.

245
00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:11.113
Mrs. Wakamatsu was watching this with all of you

246
00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:13.513
before she died, wasn't she?

247
00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:15.913
Yes.

248
00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:18.113
Huh? Are you tired?

249
00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:19.413
Of course!

250
00:13:19.413 --> 00:13:21.713
Having to watch all these flashing images one after the other...

251
00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:23.913
Okay, then.

252
00:13:23.913 --> 00:13:26.613
Can you write the kanji "waka" that is included in Mrs. Wakamatsu's name?

253
00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:29.813
Huh? Such a simple kanji character...

254
00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:35.813
Huh?

255
00:13:37.313 --> 00:13:39.613
Let's see...

256
00:13:39.613 --> 00:13:41.513
I think it was...

257
00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:43.713
No cheating!

258
00:13:43.713 --> 00:13:46.413
Mrs. Wakamatsu wasn't used to this computer

259
00:13:46.413 --> 00:13:49.513
and probably couldn't open this file.

260
00:13:49.513 --> 00:13:52.113
Hey, Takagi. The kanji character "waka"

261
00:13:52.113 --> 00:13:54.313
what was written below the radical "grass"?

262
00:13:54.313 --> 00:13:55.613
Don't you know?

263
00:13:55.613 --> 00:13:57.813
You were looking at it repeatedly many times until a while ago.

264
00:13:57.813 --> 00:13:59.613
Because he watched it repeatedly,

265
00:13:59.613 --> 00:14:02.513
he's experiencing Gestaltzerfall!

266
00:14:02.513 --> 00:14:05.513
-Gestaltzerfall? -Yeah!

267
00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:08.013
There are times when a soil on the wall or the shape of a cloud

268
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.513
looks like the face of someone, aren't there?

269
00:14:10.513 --> 00:14:13.313
That's because the face neuron inside your brain reacts

270
00:14:13.313 --> 00:14:16.713
and mistakenly recognizes the shapes as faces!

271
00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:19.313
There's a thing called the kanji neuron

272
00:14:19.313 --> 00:14:21.913
that resembles the face neuron in the brain, too.

273
00:14:21.913 --> 00:14:24.213
If you keep looking at the same kanji repeatedly many times,

274
00:14:24.213 --> 00:14:27.813
it's said that the kanji neuron gets tired

275
00:14:27.813 --> 00:14:29.413
and starts to malfunction!

276
00:14:29.413 --> 00:14:31.013
In other words, even if it's a word that you know really well,

277
00:14:31.013 --> 00:14:32.613
you start wondering was this the way it was written?

278
00:14:32.613 --> 00:14:34.513
And lose track of what once you could do.

279
00:14:34.513 --> 00:14:36.713
This is called Gestaltzerfall!

280
00:14:36.713 --> 00:14:37.913
I get it.

281
00:14:37.913 --> 00:14:41.813
The culprit repeatedly showed "Wakkodo no Sake" to Mrs. Wakamatsu.

282
00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:44.413
And after she experienced Gestaltzerfall,

283
00:14:44.413 --> 00:14:47.513
asked her to sign the contract!

284
00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:51.213
She would've had to sign it "Serika Wakamatsu".

285
00:14:51.213 --> 00:14:53.013
And the vice-president not being able to remember

286
00:14:53.013 --> 00:14:54.913
how to write the character "waka",

287
00:14:54.913 --> 00:14:58.013
took the Japanese dictionary that was on the bookshelf

288
00:14:58.013 --> 00:15:00.913
and touched the "wa" page that was laced with poison,

289
00:15:00.913 --> 00:15:03.813
thus, she ended up licking the poison.

290
00:15:03.813 --> 00:15:05.013
Yeah.

291
00:15:05.013 --> 00:15:06.613
"Waka" is one of the kanji characters

292
00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:09.213
that easily causes Gestaltzerfall.

293
00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:11.713
It seems that Mrs. Wakamatsu had a habit of licking her thumb

294
00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:13.913
when flipping the pages, too.

295
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.713
Which means that the one who thought up this trick,

296
00:15:15.713 --> 00:15:18.213
-and committed the crime is... -Yeah.

297
00:15:18.213 --> 00:15:21.413
The person who showed the kanji character "waka" to her repeatedly

298
00:15:21.413 --> 00:15:23.513
and asked her to sign the contract, too.

299
00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:25.313
Ms. Satake, her secretary!

300
00:15:25.313 --> 00:15:26.813
What?

301
00:15:30.313 --> 00:15:33.513
You're the only one who could've carried out this crime!

302
00:15:35.013 --> 00:15:37.513
Ms. Satake really did it?

303
00:15:37.513 --> 00:15:39.413
I can't believe it.

304
00:15:39.413 --> 00:15:41.113
But...

305
00:15:41.113 --> 00:15:43.113
Could it be that all the disadvantageous evidence

306
00:15:43.113 --> 00:15:45.313
pointed at Ms. Satake?

307
00:15:45.313 --> 00:15:47.413
The fact that Ikuro was hungry

308
00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.813
was really because I had coincidentally run out of soy sauce.

309
00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:52.313
I don't think it was a coincidence.

310
00:15:52.313 --> 00:15:56.113
When Mrs. Wakamatsu asked you to serve tea once again,

311
00:15:56.113 --> 00:15:59.213
you asked her what brand she would like you to serve?

312
00:15:59.213 --> 00:16:04.013
You knew where in the kitchen is what in this, right?

313
00:16:05.413 --> 00:16:07.813
If so, I guess it would've been possible for you

314
00:16:07.813 --> 00:16:09.413
to secretly get rid of the soy sauce, no?

315
00:16:09.413 --> 00:16:11.613
Well, since you're the secretary,

316
00:16:11.613 --> 00:16:14.413
you would've known that by the time Ikuro got hungry

317
00:16:14.413 --> 00:16:19.613
the managing director as well as we would get here.

318
00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:21.613
It's a usual thing that the managing director

319
00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:23.513
would buy baumkuchen before coming.

320
00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:25.513
On top of that, if you knew the number of guests you'd be having,

321
00:16:25.513 --> 00:16:28.113
it would've been easy for you to cut it into eight pieces.

322
00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:29.813
You're the one who said to cut the baumkuchen

323
00:16:29.813 --> 00:16:31.413
into eight pieces too, right?

324
00:16:31.413 --> 00:16:35.113
You said because it'd be difficult to cut into six or seven pieces.

325
00:16:35.113 --> 00:16:39.213
Then you pretended to place the cut pieces of baumkuchen onto the plates

326
00:16:39.213 --> 00:16:42.713
and sprinkled poison onto one of the two pieces.

327
00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:46.713
Then, when did she lace the door knob and slippers with poison?

328
00:16:46.713 --> 00:16:49.113
Before we came, I guess.

329
00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:53.113
When we came, Ms. Satake was already in the house,

330
00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:55.513
so I think she had made preparations

331
00:16:55.513 --> 00:16:57.713
to kill Mrs. Wakamatsu in the study to by then.

332
00:16:57.713 --> 00:17:00.913
But I'm the one who recommended that the vice-president

333
00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:04.713
should stay back in the study because she looked tired.

334
00:17:04.713 --> 00:17:06.213
If you didn't say it,

335
00:17:06.213 --> 00:17:10.313
Ms. Satake would've suggested it anyway.

336
00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:12.213
After that...

337
00:17:12.213 --> 00:17:13.613
If it's an official on site investigation,

338
00:17:13.613 --> 00:17:14.813
you need a warrant issued from court on hand

339
00:17:14.813 --> 00:17:16.413
before starting the investigation

340
00:17:16.413 --> 00:17:19.313
and be able to show it at the scene.

341
00:17:19.313 --> 00:17:21.013
They would have to make us understand

342
00:17:21.013 --> 00:17:23.913
the contents of the warrant, too.

343
00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:28.113
She said this deliberately to lead us to the fake poison

344
00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:30.913
on the door knob of Ikuro's room to throw us off!

345
00:17:30.913 --> 00:17:33.913
You're also the one who called me over to the house in Osaka

346
00:17:33.913 --> 00:17:36.113
after getting me interested in the optical illusion and worked it out

347
00:17:36.113 --> 00:17:39.113
so that I would come to this house too, right?

348
00:17:39.113 --> 00:17:40.313
The phrase, a warped entity

349
00:17:40.313 --> 00:17:42.313
that humans created of their own imagination

350
00:17:42.313 --> 00:17:46.313
that cannot be seen normally, also refers to optical illusion, right?

351
00:17:47.213 --> 00:17:48.713
There are people that played the role

352
00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:51.113
of misleads in this trick!

353
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:54.013
There were the two that used optical illusion

354
00:17:54.013 --> 00:17:55.613
to deceive everyone from the fact that they killed the president,

355
00:17:55.613 --> 00:17:57.413
so as in an eye for an eye,

356
00:17:57.413 --> 00:18:01.213
the two were killed by using optical illusion!

357
00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:02.813
It's true that it would be a trick

358
00:18:02.813 --> 00:18:04.813
you'd like to use in a detective novel,

359
00:18:04.813 --> 00:18:08.113
but circumstantial evidence is all there is!

360
00:18:08.113 --> 00:18:11.613
Where do you have the concrete evidence to support your deduction?

361
00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:13.113
Huh?

362
00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:15.213
Your wristwatch, secretary...

363
00:18:15.213 --> 00:18:19.013
It's glossy here and there. Why?

364
00:18:19.013 --> 00:18:20.913
Well, this is...

365
00:18:20.913 --> 00:18:23.313
That's the immovable concrete evidence!

366
00:18:23.313 --> 00:18:25.413
Most probably when you sprinkled poison powder

367
00:18:25.413 --> 00:18:27.113
onto the Japanese dictionary,

368
00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:29.013
the poison powder spilled on to your left hand

369
00:18:29.013 --> 00:18:30.913
that you were holding the dictionary with too.

370
00:18:30.913 --> 00:18:33.013
Back then the hydrogen cyanide poison

371
00:18:33.013 --> 00:18:35.913
that got caught in between the space of your bronze wristwatch...

372
00:18:35.913 --> 00:18:38.313
most probably went through redox, washing the rust off

373
00:18:38.313 --> 00:18:41.513
when you went to the restroom

374
00:18:41.513 --> 00:18:44.513
and washed your hands or something.

375
00:18:44.513 --> 00:18:46.413
You noticed this only back when

376
00:18:46.413 --> 00:18:49.913
you remarked that you'd miss the last train.

377
00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:52.513
It's about time for the last train.

378
00:18:52.513 --> 00:18:55.313
You were looking at your wristwatch then.

379
00:18:55.313 --> 00:18:57.413
That's why you held the PET bottle

380
00:18:57.413 --> 00:18:59.813
in a strange way, back then, right?

381
00:19:01.313 --> 00:19:03.213
It's understandable if Mr. Fujinami who switched the bottle

382
00:19:03.213 --> 00:19:04.913
he was holding in his hand

383
00:19:04.913 --> 00:19:06.813
in order to look at his wristwatch did so...

384
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.713
Normally, you wouldn't hold the PET bottle

385
00:19:09.713 --> 00:19:11.113
in the same hand you take off the lid with.

386
00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:15.013
I see.

387
00:19:15.013 --> 00:19:19.613
So that's when you realized I was using only my right hand.

388
00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:22.413
If I use my left hand, my sleeve would flip over

389
00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:24.913
and the wristwatch would come into view.

390
00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:27.013
But, how ironic that

391
00:19:27.013 --> 00:19:30.813
this wristwatch I received from my father would give me away.

392
00:19:30.813 --> 00:19:32.013
Father...

393
00:19:32.013 --> 00:19:34.213
Are you the president's daughter?

394
00:19:34.213 --> 00:19:35.713
Yes.

395
00:19:35.713 --> 00:19:39.713
I'm the daughter from my father's first marriage.

396
00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:41.813
I actually entered this company wanting to run it into bankruptcy

397
00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.413
because he abandoned my mother.

398
00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:46.613
But after I found out that he was just a workaholic, poor soul,

399
00:19:46.613 --> 00:19:50.313
that wasn't good at expressing love...

400
00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:52.913
I went out for wool and came home shorn.

401
00:19:52.913 --> 00:19:56.213
Moreover, he knew that I was his daughter to begin with.

402
00:19:56.213 --> 00:19:58.513
The fact was that he was planning to announce to everyone

403
00:19:58.513 --> 00:20:02.113
that I was his daughter at his villa in Karuizawa.

404
00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:03.413
What?

405
00:20:03.413 --> 00:20:06.513
I heard so from the president, too.

406
00:20:06.513 --> 00:20:10.213
But, just before that, my father was killed by Ikuro.

407
00:20:10.213 --> 00:20:13.213
And then the vice-president hid the evidence.

408
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:16.513
I don't know why my father was killed.

409
00:20:16.513 --> 00:20:19.213
Before the time I started to understand him,

410
00:20:19.213 --> 00:20:21.013
I hated him quite a bit, too.

411
00:20:21.013 --> 00:20:24.913
Then, you read the contents of the letter, didn't you?

412
00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:26.113
Yes.

413
00:20:26.113 --> 00:20:30.113
Yet, the vice-president said nothing after that so.

414
00:20:30.113 --> 00:20:33.813
Maybe she gave it to me hoping

415
00:20:33.813 --> 00:20:36.013
that I would kill Ikuro.

416
00:20:36.013 --> 00:20:39.913
It was my mistake that I called Mr. Hattori over.

417
00:20:39.913 --> 00:20:42.313
I meant to mislead him,

418
00:20:42.313 --> 00:20:45.513
but he was way over me.

419
00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:50.013
Or rather, should I say, "they".

420
00:20:50.013 --> 00:20:53.313
Well, it was a crime using the trick of optical illusion,

421
00:20:53.313 --> 00:20:55.813
so I guess the deceitful oft into the snares of deceit

422
00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:58.113
is exactly what this is.

423
00:20:59.513 --> 00:21:01.713
She's pretty good with words.

424
00:21:03.713 --> 00:21:06.213
Heiji turned the brim of his cap behind!

425
00:21:06.213 --> 00:21:08.913
It's your chance! Chance time!

426
00:21:08.913 --> 00:21:12.613
I think I shouldn't, not today, don't you think?

427
00:21:12.613 --> 00:21:15.813
Heiji's tired from using his head on the case, too.

428
00:21:19.613 --> 00:21:22.513
I'm going to borrow Conan for a while, okay?

429
00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:24.513
Kazuha! Give it all you got!

430
00:21:30.813 --> 00:21:32.113
What is it?

431
00:21:32.113 --> 00:21:33.613
I was planning to have a battle with Shinichi

432
00:21:33.613 --> 00:21:36.013
about what he thought about the case from now and then.

433
00:21:36.013 --> 00:21:37.813
Can't you tell?

434
00:21:37.813 --> 00:21:39.013
They went off

435
00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:41.313
so that we could have time to ourselves, just the two of us.

436
00:21:41.313 --> 00:21:43.213
Huh?

437
00:21:43.213 --> 00:21:47.113
Maybe you've already heard about this from Shinichi,

438
00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:49.313
but it seems that he confessed

439
00:21:49.313 --> 00:21:52.613
how he felt towards Ran in London.

440
00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:55.613
And that's not why I'm about to say what I'm going to say,

441
00:21:55.613 --> 00:21:58.413
but the thing is...

442
00:21:58.413 --> 00:22:00.813
The thing is I...

443
00:22:00.813 --> 00:22:04.013
from way before...

444
00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:05.613
really...

445
00:22:05.613 --> 00:22:09.013
I like you a whole lot!

446
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:37.513
He's gone? Heiji?

447
00:23:37.513 --> 00:23:41.413
He ran off in the middle of the conversation!

448
00:23:41.413 --> 00:23:42.813
About where?

449
00:23:42.813 --> 00:23:45.013
By the part you said, "The thing is..."

450
00:23:45.013 --> 00:23:47.313
What?

451
00:23:49.313 --> 00:23:51.613
Hey, Shinichi!

452
00:23:51.613 --> 00:23:56.313
Don't you have anything you need to tell your best friend here about?

453
00:23:56.313 --> 00:23:58.913
-No, I don't. -Just tell me, I bet you have!

454
00:23:58.913 --> 00:24:00.513
They are really get along, don't you think?

455
00:24:00.513 --> 00:24:02.813
So jealous of Conan.

456
00:24:02.813 --> 00:24:04.613
Don't hide it.

457
00:24:04.613 --> 00:24:06.713
I said, there's nothing.

458
00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.913
"Next Episode" -Is Haibara the quiet looking girl

459
00:24:10.913 --> 00:24:14.013
with short hair that lives at Doc's house?

460
00:24:14.013 --> 00:24:16.513
-Have you met her before? -No.

461
00:24:16.513 --> 00:24:18.013
I had a glimpse of her

462
00:24:18.013 --> 00:24:21.413
at Doc's animation site on the Net.

463
00:24:21.413 --> 00:24:23.113
But how strange.

464
00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:25.813
I wasn't supposed to be in that animation.

465
00:24:30.913 --> 00:24:32.513
Don't tell me that...

466
00:24:32.513 --> 00:24:37.913
Next Conan, "Doc's Animation Site (Part 1)"

467
00:24:53.413 --> 00:24:55.713
Next Conan's Hint:

468
00:24:55.713 --> 00:24:57.913
"Glasses lens"

469
00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.113
Did you already see the movie "The 11th Drunkard"?

470
00:25:00.113 --> 00:25:01.613
Dad! It's "The 11th Striker"!

471
00:25:01.613 --> 00:25:03.001
Own goal.
