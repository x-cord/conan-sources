1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,840
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,940
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,840
Conan, Kogoro and Officer Yamamura.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
The briefcase is the link over time and space.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:01,453
A client's call to solve the mystery of the briefcase,

9
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:04,053
we headed to the Aoiya Inn

10
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:06,853
with Officer Yamamura.

11
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:08,953
A man wearing a red jacket was found dead

12
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:11,053
in the Kashiragami Forest.

13
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:15,153
Strangely, the man was wearing a sweater in the middle of summer.

14
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:16,453
Car keys and cigarettes were found on him

15
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:19,453
but without his driver's license or matches.

16
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:23,853
The briefcase in question was entrusted to the innkeeper

17
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,153
five years ago by a long-haired man wearing a red jacket.

18
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,353
But...

19
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:31,353
apparently someone came and take it

20
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,953
while impersonating Pops Kogoro.

21
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,953
The briefcase contained

22
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:37,753
five-year-old sports newspaper

23
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:39,553
and a bundle of hair!

24
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:47,753
"The Kogoro Mouri's Impostor (Part 2)"

25
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:50,553
Then... Does this mean...

26
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,453
Yes. This is a homicide.

27
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:54,253
And the culprit knew

28
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,853
where the "Closed for cleaning" sign is.

29
00:02:56,853 --> 00:03:01,753
That means, the culprit is among the employees.

30
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:05,453
"Masao Jinbo (34), Yoshiro Onda (58), Eiji Urakawa (37)"

31
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:06,753
The culprit is probably is the person

32
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,153
that has something to do with the long-haired man

33
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:11,053
who committed suicide four years ago!

34
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:13,153
And probably the long-haired man

35
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:14,353
didn't commit suicide at all.

36
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:16,053
He was killed.

37
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:19,353
Someone had tampered the body on purpose.

38
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:22,153
But who? And why?

39
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:28,653
Officer Yamamura! I found a cell phone.

40
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,053
What?

41
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:33,253
It was in the jacket of the victim.

42
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,853
I found one phone number in its memory.

43
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,253
Would you like to try?

44
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,153
Yes. Of course!

45
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,553
"Redial 01"

46
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,453
Tatsuo! Is that you?

47
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,753
What happened to that gold mine of yours?

48
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:55,553
Let me know when you get your hands on it!

49
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:59,453
Oh, yes, I got a call from your landlord.

50
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:02,053
He says he won't extend the contract

51
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:04,353
and he'll have to evict you if you don't pay the rent.

52
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,553
Hey, are you listening to me?

53
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:09,053
-Excuse me. -Hey, got a customer!

54
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:11,453
Call me back later!

55
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,253
He hung up.

56
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,453
He mentioned something about a gold mine.

57
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,353
And he said that the contract can't be extended

58
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,053
unless the rent is paid.

59
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,753
Extend?

60
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,753
Anyway, we found that the name of the victim

61
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,853
is "Tatsuo Mori".

62
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:28,253
It's one step forward in solving the case.

63
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:33,053
What? How did you know his name is Tatsuo Mori?

64
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,853
Look! The phone has a name label on it!

65
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:41,453
Using a name label like a little kid. How immature!

66
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,053
Sorry for being immature!

67
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,953
I have one on mine, too!

68
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:46,053
What?

69
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,053
It's fine because you're still a kid!

70
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,153
What's that supposed to mean?

71
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:53,253
Hold on. That means the murderer is.

72
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,153
Hey, officer.

73
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:57,353
Can you give me more details

74
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:59,053
about what the long-haired man had on him?

75
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,153
What?

76
00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:02,253
You already asked that before that.

77
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:05,853
He had a receipt for the milk and bun he bought four years ago!

78
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,253
Well... see.

79
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,353
Then, would you like to see the photos!

80
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,453
Photos?

81
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:15,253
I came to the inn today to ask about these photos.

82
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:18,753
This is the front and back of the crushed milk package.

83
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:22,353
The crushed bun and cigarettes

84
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:25,953
The convenience store receipt was found in his wallet.

85
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:28,353
The July 10 date of the receipt

86
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:31,153
it is the date of the tour the employees went on, right?

87
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,653
Yes.

88
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:36,653
Yes! That was it!

89
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:40,053
Now I see it! What the culprit wanted!

90
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,953
Hey, officer.

91
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:43,153
What?

92
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,753
By any chance, did you find a dead body

93
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:48,153
in the Kashiragami Forest after the employee trip

94
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,953
four years ago?

95
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:52,053
Yes, we found one.

96
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,653
Near the fallen Jizo statue.

97
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,953
Then by any chance was it the person who found it...

98
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:59,053
What?

99
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,253
How did you know?

100
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:05,553
Just as I thought. He's the killer.

101
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:08,353
And, the sports newspapers there

102
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:11,353
probably is the map where something is hidden.

103
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:13,353
What I need now is proof.

104
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,453
If my deduction is correct...

105
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,253
There must be some here.

106
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:21,053
Traces of the culprit on that shogi board

107
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:22,853
and that table.

108
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,653
I found it! That is it!

109
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,353
Hey, kid! You're not allowed to go in there!

110
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,253
I've been asked by Pops Kogoro!

111
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,153
I was told to look at the table and the board very closely.

112
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:44,653
What? Detective Mouri told you?

113
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,953
Yes, and I was also told to

114
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,153
take a close look at the light in this room.

115
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,453
The light?

116
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:54,453
He says it is the key in running down the culprit!

117
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,653
What?

118
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:00,053
Anyway, the estimated time of death

119
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:04,453
is between 4 pm and 5 pm today!

120
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:08,053
That time, the culprit placed the closed for cleaning sign

121
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,053
and collected long hairs in the bathroom.

122
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,353
He took it to the room.

123
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,453
And tried to divert our attention

124
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:17,953
by making it look like a curse of the long-haired man!

125
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:21,353
If only the employees of the inn know where the sign is,

126
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:24,453
we have just about found the culprit!

127
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:27,053
I want all of the employees here now!

128
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,853
We want to interview each one

129
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:33,253
about the early evening hours today.

130
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,353
Wait, officer.

131
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:41,153
Can't employees who have never seen or heard

132
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:44,153
about the man who died four years ago be excluded?

133
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:45,753
What?

134
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,653
Weren't you all here

135
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:50,653
when the man deposited the briefcase

136
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,353
with Mr. Onda five years ago?

137
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:57,553
Well... I received the case from the man in his room.

138
00:07:57,553 --> 00:08:00,353
He was hired four years ago in spring.

139
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:02,953
And I just told the employees

140
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,053
that I have asked Detective Mouri

141
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:08,453
to come to check the case left with me five years ago.

142
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:12,053
I never mentioned it came from the long-haired man.

143
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,853
I see. So...

144
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:18,853
the connection between the briefcase and the long-haired man

145
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:22,353
wasn't known to everyone in this inn.

146
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:25,753
Hey. I am not the killer.

147
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,453
If I am the one, I won't keep it for five years.

148
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,353
I would have pried it open.

149
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:32,853
And isn't it puzzling?

150
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:37,853
Such an important case contained only old sports newspapers.

151
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:39,053
The culprit probably

152
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,853
took away something wrapped in newspaper

153
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:45,453
and has already gone far away from here.

154
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,053
Unless this newspaper has some special meaning,

155
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,353
we don't know anything.

156
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:51,953
You're right.

157
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,353
Hey.

158
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:55,653
What does "Mae-5" mean?

159
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,553
Pardon?

160
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,153
See that? I see "Mae-5" written before

161
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:02,453
the name of the tournament champion Akagimaru.

162
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,753
That means he ranked No. 5 among the maegashira wrestlers.

163
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,153
Since he belonged to the East Division,

164
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,553
he was East maegashira No. 5.

165
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,053
What's maegashira?

166
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,253
Does it have to do with the Kashiragami Forest?

167
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,553
What relation, dummy!

168
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,753
How about with the fallen Jizo statue?

169
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:20,953
Absolutely not!

170
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:23,753
Maegashira is...

171
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:25,653
A sumo wrestler ranking behind the grand champion Yokozuna

172
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:29,153
is champion Ozeki followed by the Sekiwake and komusubi ranks.

173
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,753
No. 5 means...

174
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,953
he ranks No. 5 among the maegashira wrestlers.

175
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:36,253
Okay. Then...

176
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:37,653
Akagimaru must have won the tournament

177
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,353
when he wasn't especially strong

178
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,653
because he was very cautious!

179
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,253
Cautious?

180
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,853
Because look!

181
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:48,553
Akagimaru fell in the hole only once!

182
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:49,953
What?

183
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:54,153
This means that the sumo wrestler fell in a hole, right?

184
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:57,853
It says "push-down" below that black circle.

185
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:00,253
That's not a hole!

186
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:01,953
It's a symbol for loss!

187
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:03,153
It means that he lost the match

188
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,153
on the eighth day of the tournament!

189
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:09,353
So, it doesn't mean he took eight steps and fell in a hole!

190
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:11,753
Anyway, I want you to call

191
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,553
all the employees for questioning.

192
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:17,353
Of course, we won't make any exceptions!

193
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:25,053
So, you don't have anyone in particular who can corroborate

194
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,453
what you were doing during those hours.

195
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:27,753
Yes.

196
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,153
Okay. Next, please.

197
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:31,753
Excuse me.

198
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:34,253
Will it be long?

199
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:37,153
I want to start cleaning up.

200
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,553
I have to prepare breakfast for tomorrow morning.

201
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:42,453
Can't I leave early?

202
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:45,153
No. That's not possible!

203
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:46,453
"Aoiya Inn"

204
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:49,353
So, I've questioned every one of you.

205
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:53,553
Most of you don't have alibi as to your whereabouts

206
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,553
between 4pm and 5 pm.

207
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:59,753
Of course! My employees work without interruption.

208
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,353
I don't have in my employ

209
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:05,053
anybody to monitor and clock others at work!

210
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,453
I'm impressed.

211
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:07,953
Officer Yamamura

212
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:09,653
Yes?

213
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,553
Did you see Conan and my father somewhere?

214
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:13,653
No.

215
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,453
Yes, Yamamura speaking.

216
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:21,053
Mr. Mouri?

217
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,953
Yes...

218
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:26,253
All right.

219
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,453
Excuse me. My father...

220
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,253
Well...

221
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:34,553
He went to ask neighbors around the area

222
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,653
and was taken under police custody for suspicious behavior.

223
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,353
He's at a police station.

224
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,753
What?

225
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:43,053
Looks like Conan is with him.

226
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:46,453
Anyway, I will go to pick him up at the station.

227
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,553
So, stay here and wait in this room!

228
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,553
Well...

229
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:53,053
How about us?

230
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,753
You can all go to sleep now.

231
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,053
We will hold a more thorough investigation

232
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:01,853
on a later date!

233
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:02,953
Bye!

234
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:21,061
Rocks. It can't be...

235
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:26,761
What...

236
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:30,961
I guess you've been looking for this, Mr. Jinbo.

237
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,861
No..

238
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,561
Or should I say the man

239
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,961
behind the 100-million yen blackmail case!

240
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,161
What?

241
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:42,761
I found as soon as we checked through

242
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:45,161
the serial numbers of the bills.

243
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,461
Five years ago, that the money was extorted

244
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,661
from a candy manufacturer by two men.

245
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:54,061
One of them being you,

246
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,861
and the other is

247
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,961
the long-haired man who had the case

248
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,961
kept by the innkeeper.

249
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:03,961
And the sport newspaper in the briefcase

250
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,461
pointed to the location of the money.

251
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,261
Akagimaru who made the headlines

252
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:11,461
was East Maegashira No. 5!

253
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,961
Maegashira,

254
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:17,361
literally meaning front head,

255
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:20,361
was the key suggesting the fallen statue in the forest.

256
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,561
Walk east five steps from the statue.

257
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,561
You take eight steps from there

258
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,961
according to Akagimaru's win or loss record.

259
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,261
If you dig the spot there,

260
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:35,961
you're expected to find a pot filled with money!

261
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,561
Right? Mr. Mouri?

262
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:38,861
Yes.

263
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,661
The reason why the long-haired man

264
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,061
put the newspaper inside the case

265
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,261
and gave it to the innkeeper for storage

266
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,061
is because he was aware

267
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,461
that you might kill him

268
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:53,861
to get the entire fortune.

269
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:58,161
Well, it was quite natural for him to notice that.

270
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:02,261
He probably was responsible for carrying the money.

271
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:05,561
And he was told meet in this forest,

272
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:08,861
which is a well-known suicide spot.

273
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:11,161
This is corroborated by the fact that

274
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,361
he included a memo in the case a message cursing you

275
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:16,161
just in case you would come and kill him

276
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,161
before taking the money alone

277
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:20,961
as a revenge.

278
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,161
Sure enough, you killed him in this forest,

279
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,161
making it look like suicide

280
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,961
and appeared in the inn with confidence

281
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:33,161
hiding your face with a hat, glasses and beard.

282
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:39,061
However, what you got was a memo cursing you to death.

283
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:41,561
You couldn't give up

284
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:46,061
and decided to investigate by working for the inn.

285
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:50,461
Time passed, and the body of the long-haired man was found.

286
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,061
This led to your discovery that the innkeeper

287
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,761
kept the briefcase for five years

288
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,461
and has requested me to conduct an investigation.

289
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,761
You hired the man to pose as me

290
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,561
and get the case before I do.

291
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:07,961
You wanted to see what's inside the case.

292
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:10,061
However,

293
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:12,861
you only found it contained an old sports newspaper.

294
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,661
The man who expected to get his share of the money got angry.

295
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:18,361
He threatened you saying that

296
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,461
"If you don't give me my money,"

297
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:24,761
"then I will let the real Kogoro Mouri everything!"

298
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:28,061
You had no choice but to kill him

299
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:31,561
and left the mystery for me to solve.

300
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:33,461
The best proof is

301
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:37,461
the fact that you have come here to find the money.

302
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,061
Now, let's go to the police station.

303
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:41,861
What are you talking about?

304
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:46,261
I was just inspired by the newspaper and came here.

305
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:49,861
I thought that I may be able to help the investigation.

306
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:51,761
Get off it.

307
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:56,861
In fact, the long-haired man died four years ago on July 10.

308
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:59,461
At that time, I was on the employee's trip.

309
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:02,261
No! That's the thing.

310
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:05,561
He was not killed in summer four years ago.

311
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,461
That was in fall five years ago!

312
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,661
Immediately after he deposited the briefcase at the inn!

313
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:14,061
You planted the milk, cigarettes, bun

314
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,761
and the convenience store receipt later!

315
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,461
You did it to mislead us

316
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,961
regarding time of death

317
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:23,761
and to make sure you have an alibi!

318
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:25,761
The milk package and receipt

319
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:29,661
came from another suicide case you found

320
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,761
after the employee trip four years ago!

321
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,461
That is why the long-haired man was wearing a sweater

322
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:38,661
and had cigarettes but not lighter or matches!

323
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,361
You removed the driver's license from him

324
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,761
because the license was soon to expire.

325
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:44,861
Your alibi will not work

326
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,161
if the body have a driver's license on him

327
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:49,961
that expired a year earlier.

328
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:54,461
You placed the bundle of hair in the newspaper because...

329
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:56,761
You wanted to direct police attention to the fact that

330
00:17:56,761 --> 00:18:00,161
the person who killed the impostor is linked to the long-haired man.

331
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,661
And make the police think

332
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:04,561
you're not a suspect because of the receipt.

333
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,461
We know everything you planned!

334
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,861
Then, how did you know that the milk package and receipt

335
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:11,961
were placed later?

336
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:13,561
What?

337
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,861
The man may have actually had them with him, right?

338
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:20,461
Well, that's...

339
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,461
The straw!

340
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:27,061
The milk package did not have a straw attached to it.

341
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,361
That is proof that milk has been emptied

342
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,261
then someone refilled it in the package,

343
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:36,261
and sealed the lid with glue again and placed it beside the body.

344
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:40,061
No one puts an opened package of milk

345
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:41,461
inside a knapsack, right?

346
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:45,161
Yes... That's right!

347
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:47,161
Then, did you see it?

348
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,961
Did you see me kill the long-haired man?

349
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:54,861
Certainly, it happened too long ago to determine

350
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:57,361
whether you committed that murder.

351
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:59,561
However, we have proof that you killed the man

352
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,261
who posed as me!

353
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:03,261
What?

354
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:07,261
To carry a body and hang it from a high place,

355
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:11,161
the person carrying it must reach as high as the ceiling.

356
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,561
What the killer used to reach that high

357
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:16,561
was the shogi board and the table.

358
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,261
Of course, he had to take off his socks

359
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,561
in order not to slip.

360
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:23,261
I heard from the forensics that

361
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:26,061
there are footprints found on them.

362
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,261
What will happen

363
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:30,861
if we checked the prints against yours?

364
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:34,361
Oh, yes.

365
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:35,761
I did use them as a stool!

366
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,961
When I changed the light bulbs in the room.

367
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,561
I'm not lying!

368
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:41,661
If you check the light bulb,

369
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:43,561
my fingerprints should be there.

370
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:48,461
Yes, surprisingly, we found your fingerprints

371
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:51,261
under a thick layer of dust!

372
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:55,861
They probably were there for a long period of time!

373
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,561
Still, your footprints were there,

374
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:04,061
suggesting that you were the killer!

375
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:06,861
I've never heard of an inn that does not wipe desks

376
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:10,761
until a thick layer of dust collects on the light bulb!

377
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:14,461
Mr. Jinbo, let us all stop this.

378
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:18,861
Let's not tamper with time.

379
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,661
But...

380
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:23,361
But how did you know it was me?

381
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:26,461
You told us.

382
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:31,361
In the lobby, when you delivered my daughter's cell phone.

383
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,661
That time, you gave it to me without hesitation,

384
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,661
when Officer Yamamura was there,

385
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,661
someone you had never met before.

386
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:42,561
You told me, " Is this your daughter's?"

387
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:44,261
What about that?

388
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:46,161
I saw the name seal that said "Ran Mouri"

389
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,261
pasted on the cell phone.

390
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:49,361
That's why...

391
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:56,061
That's right. You knew me the moment you saw me.

392
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:59,861
That I am the real Kogoro Mouri.

393
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:40,261
I was really excited.

394
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:43,761
To see the great Sleeping Kogoro in action.

395
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,461
I can only recall up until

396
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:48,961
Conan tried to drag me into the forest.

397
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:51,161
I was astounded

398
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,561
when you phoned me instructions

399
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:55,961
to go to the forest for your deduction show.

400
00:22:55,961 --> 00:23:02,161
Dad, why did the people at the inn call me Miss Echigo?

401
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,361
Never mind.

402
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:05,461
Hey!

403
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:10,161
-Excuse us. -Excuse us!

404
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:13,661
Is this the way to Aoiya Inn?

405
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,761
We're trying to get there

406
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,061
to see Detective Kogoro Mouri!

407
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,961
We got off the bus here but don't know how to get there.

408
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:25,261
Oh! You don't need to do that.

409
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:26,561
Here...

410
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,861
What a coincidence!

411
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:32,961
We were just on our way back there!

412
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:33,961
Do you want a ride?

413
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:36,661
Yes, of course! Is it really okay?

414
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,961
No big deal. Come on!

415
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,561
Great!

416
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,661
Thank you so much!

417
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,461
By the way, what's your name?

418
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:50,361
What? My name?

419
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,161
Let's say I'm just a "man of the world"

420
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,161
going by the name of Kingoro Toyama.

421
00:24:00,461 --> 00:24:02,761
That old man never learns...

422
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,461
"Next Episode" -Don't be silly!

423
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:08,861
I just started drinking!

424
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:11,061
A gunshot?

425
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,861
What was that?

426
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:20,161
It's right on target.

427
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:23,261
This is undoubtedly the weapon.

428
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,861
It was impossible for people at the party to shoot

429
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:28,761
when the shot was heard.

430
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,161
Next Conan,

431
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Gunshot at Sunflower Manor"

432
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,979
Next Conan Hint:

433
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:39,879
"Rotation"

434
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:40,979
Next episode has a unique trick.

435
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,779
We need to get our arms ready for the next case.

436
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:45,179
We're going to shoot the breeze!
