1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,840
March 14th is White Day.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,940
Talking about White Day,

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,340
did you receive anything, Ran?

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,740
A gift in return from Shinichi.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,740
You gave him hand-made Valentine's chocolate too, didn't you, Ran?

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,640
Well, I did sort of give it to him.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,340
Or rather, he ate it without permission.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,340
I wonder if Kygyoku's going to give me something,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,140
in return on White Day.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,040
If you give somebody chocolate on Valentine's Day,

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,240
you get a return gift on March 14th!

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,340
First, you casually give him a Valentine's Day gift

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,540
and exactly a month afterwards on March 14th,

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,040
if he gives you a gift in return,

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
the bells of days of romance after romance will resound.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,240
But, if you get nothing, then the footsteps of broken love

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
will close in.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,540
Footsteps of broken love?

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,340
Tears are start of all dramas.

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,040
Sour tasting White Day.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,140
Solve the miracle trick!

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,540
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:37,994
We were invited to the 8th Anniversary party

27
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,394
of the establishment of Urai Confections.

28
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,794
Every year on the anniversary of his company's establishment day,

29
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,094
President Urai puts on a performance, such as magic shows and skits

30
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,394
to entertain his guests,

31
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:50,394
and everyone waits in anticipation.

32
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:56,894
However, President Urai lets out a loud groan and collapses to the floor.

33
00:02:56,894 --> 00:03:00,094
Everyone thinks that he's acting out a mystery skit this year,

34
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,394
but the president actually dies.

35
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:05,594
Although it is concluded that

36
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,794
he died potassium cyanide poisoning,

37
00:03:07,794 --> 00:03:10,894
the president's wife Hoshie, who was nearest to him

38
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,794
was reading Ran's palm at the time,

39
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,994
and could not have administered the poison.

40
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:17,994
A bottle of poison and wafers are discovered

41
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:20,794
from inside the president's car.

42
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:22,594
This increases the possibility of him

43
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:25,494
having committed suicide because as Hoshie explains,

44
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:28,994
they were contemplating a divorce as well as splitting the company up.

45
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,794
However...

46
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:35,894
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 2)".

47
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,294
Mrs. Urai.

48
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:44,094
I think you should hurry up and call the store.

49
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:45,194
What?

50
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,694
Because all you and the president

51
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:52,194
were doing at the party was drinking, and not eat.

52
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:54,094
So, I'm sure you reserved to have dinner

53
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:56,494
at a high-class restaurant or something, right?

54
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:58,794
I have no reservation.

55
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,694
"Hoshie Urai (49)" -To get my husband's metabolism going,

56
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,694
"Taruto Urai's wife" -eating dinner out was a no-no.

57
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:07,294
I made healthy meals for him every day.

58
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,994
I see.

59
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:11,594
What was the menu for tonight, then?

60
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,894
Well, I wonder what it was.

61
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:18,694
This party ends at 21:00.

62
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:22,394
And if you see the guests off, it'll be later,

63
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:26,394
so you must've bought the ingredients already, right?

64
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:28,494
You couldn't have known beforehand

65
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:30,694
that something like this was going to happen, right?

66
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:33,394
What the...

67
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,994
What's with this child?

68
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:42,794
There's no doubt that she's the killer.

69
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,794
But, how did she administer the poison?

70
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:47,294
When the president collapsed,

71
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:49,694
Mrs. Urai was definitely reading Ran's palm

72
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,094
and both of her hands were full.

73
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,694
If she were to set something up,

74
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:58,694
it would've been the words that she mumbled, "Is it working?".

75
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:02,194
But, what could she make him do with those words?

76
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,394
What? Do you have pollen allergy, Officer Chiba?

77
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:10,194
Yes. I drank medicine,

78
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:11,694
but doesn't seem to be working.

79
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:16,094
And, if I drink too much, I'll get sleepy.

80
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:17,694
Working?

81
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,494
I wish there was a miracle pollen allergy drug

82
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:23,994
that won't make you sleepy even if you drink it.

83
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,694
Miracle?

84
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:28,894
Have them hurry on checking the poison and wafers

85
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,994
that were found in the victim's car.

86
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:31,994
Yes, sir!

87
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:35,394
Oh, no! Dad's cigarette is on the table!

88
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:39,694
Oh no, the paper napkin is burnt!

89
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,694
But, I'm sure glad that nothing caught fire.

90
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:43,994
My God.

91
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:47,994
That's the paper napkin that came with Mrs. Urai's iced lemon tea.

92
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,694
I see.

93
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:55,994
That's why Mrs. Urai deliberately went pass there.

94
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:59,594
Hey, Officer Takagi!

95
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,794
I want you to look for what Pops asked me

96
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,294
to tell you to look for.

97
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,794
Look for what?

98
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:11,894
The evidence for the miracle trick the culprit tried to hide.

99
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,694
The cause of my husband's death

100
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:22,494
is acute drug poisoning due to cyanide compounds.

101
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,694
If anyone could administer the poison to him,

102
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:25,794
it would be me.

103
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,794
However, at that time, I was holding Ran's left hand

104
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:31,194
with both my hands and reading her palms,

105
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:34,194
so I couldn't have given him the poison using my hands.

106
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,194
Moreover, a container with poison and wafers

107
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:39,694
were found in my husband's car.

108
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:45,394
On top of that, a wafer was stuck between his molar.

109
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:46,894
Which means, my husband had the poison wrapped in the wafer

110
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,394
and was holding it.

111
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:52,194
So, during the party he drank it and committed suicide.

112
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:54,894
That's the only thing thinkable, no?

113
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,494
I guess so.

114
00:06:56,494 --> 00:07:01,794
Then, won't you please let the people who came to the party go?

115
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:04,794
Besides, I've been cleared of suspicion too.

116
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:07,494
In the first place, if I were the killer,

117
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,694
I wouldn't invite a great detective like Mr. Mouri to a place

118
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,594
that I would plan on committing a crime at.

119
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:15,894
True.

120
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,994
If that were to be one of your strategies, though...

121
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:22,294
it would be a different story.

122
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:27,294
No, that wasn't me, you see.

123
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:28,794
Hold it.

124
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,494
When I hear my own voice coming from someplace else.

125
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,194
I always feel a prick on my neck.

126
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:37,994
Come to think of it,

127
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:41,894
there are times I feel it on my forehead.

128
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,294
Don't tell me, Dad,

129
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,394
that the usual has come?

130
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:47,294
Hey, Mr. Mouri.

131
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,294
What does he mean by strategy?

132
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:55,594
Of course, strategy to carry out the murder trick.

133
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:59,894
In order for her to poison her husband, President Urai to death.

134
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,694
Strategy?

135
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,994
Are you saying that I used you, Mr. Mouri?

136
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,194
Yes.

137
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,894
The one who was actually used

138
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:19,694
was my daughter, Ran, who accompanied me here, though.

139
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,394
If she testifies that both your hands were full

140
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,794
because you were palm reading Ran,

141
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:29,494
and that your husband didn't move after he collapsed.

142
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:31,594
I would, more than anyone else believe her,

143
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,194
and you would be cleared off the list of suspects.

144
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,994
You committed the crime during my speech

145
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:41,394
because you wanted to keep me away at the podium,

146
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:44,994
so that I wouldn't by chance see through your trick.

147
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,794
So, just what kind of trick was it?

148
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,794
What could I have done back then?

149
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:53,694
You called out to your husband, didn't you?

150
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:56,194
You asked him, "Is it working?".

151
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:57,994
So, that was...

152
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:02,994
President Urai was a flashy character who liked to perform magic or skits.

153
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:06,394
Moreover, he hated sour things.

154
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:11,094
I'll bet you conned him in this way, Mrs. Urai.

155
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,994
"I think that everyone will be surprised if you eat the Spy Choco White

156
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:16,894
that is really sour without changing your facial expression

157
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:20,694
at the next party." Isn't that right?

158
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,494
Don't be silly.

159
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:25,294
My husband got sick eating a sour cake

160
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:27,594
just the other day, you know?

161
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:31,194
So, there is no way my husband could eat that chocolate.

162
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:35,194
There's a very miracle trick!

163
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,699
Miracle trick?

164
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:49,699
You know of the miracle fruit, don't you?

165
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:50,899
I know of it.

166
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,499
It's the berry that changes sour things to sweet when you eat it.

167
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,899
It was popular some years ago.

168
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,699
It's a small red berry

169
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:02,599
originally from West Africa that works on the taste buds

170
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:05,099
and changes sour-tasting things to sweet temporarily

171
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:08,099
that includes miraculin, a glycoprotein.

172
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,599
It is indeed a miracle fruit.

173
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,899
If you roll it carefully over your tongue,

174
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,399
the effect keeps for 1-2 hours.

175
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,999
That's why Mrs. Urai, you gave the berry to the president beforehand

176
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:25,699
and asked him "Is the miracle fruit still working?", right?

177
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:28,599
Then, don't tell me that the poison was...

178
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,599
Yes.

179
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:35,899
The thing most suitable that was on the table back then for testing

180
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:36,999
was the lemon slice

181
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,699
on the glass cup of the lemon tea the Mrs. Urai was drinking.

182
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:44,499
Mr. Urai cut off a part of the fruit beforehand

183
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:50,199
and put poison wrapped in a wafer into the cut portion of the fruit.

184
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,299
So that when the president put it in his mouth,

185
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:55,199
the poison would melt in his mouth.

186
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,399
In other words,

187
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,199
Mrs. Urai wrapped the lemon that she put the poison inside with something,

188
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,199
snuck it in her pocket and entered the hall.

189
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,999
Then she switched the lemon on the iced lemon tea that she picked up

190
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,099
with the poisoned lemon.

191
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,299
She sandwiched the original lemon in between a paper napkin and hid it,

192
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,699
then waited for my speech.

193
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:17,699
And along with the remark she made, and after the president collapsed,

194
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,899
she swiftly took the poisoned lemon

195
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,799
that was in the president's mouth out and hid it.

196
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,399
While everyone's attention was focused on the president,

197
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,799
she switched the original lemon

198
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,599
that was sandwiched between the paper napkin

199
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,799
back into the glass cup again.

200
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,099
This way,

201
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,099
even if the police came back later and checked,

202
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:39,199
no poison would be found from on top of the table.

203
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,399
By the way, when you first picked up the iced lemon tea,

204
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,699
you deliberately chose a cup from the third row

205
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,699
because you wanted to choose one with a lemon

206
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:51,799
of the same size as the one you had.

207
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,499
Am I wrong?

208
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,299
Just as would be expected of you, great detective.

209
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,299
You're very observant up to the minutest detail.

210
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:08,299
But, I chose that glass cup out of mere habit.

211
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,199
Haven't you done it too?

212
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,599
To pick not the one in the foreground,

213
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,599
but the one in back.

214
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,899
I have!

215
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,499
When I buy milk at the convenience store, I always do so.

216
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:21,799
Besides, if my husband took the lemon from my glass cup

217
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,299
and put it into his mouth,

218
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,899
I'm sure someone would've been watching.

219
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,799
No, I don't think anyone was watching.

220
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,799
Because I'm sure that the president himself

221
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,499
made sure that no one saw him do so.

222
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:37,999
If somebody sees him looking alright eating something sour,

223
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,399
he wouldn't be able to surprise them.

224
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,999
But, as for the evidence of the original lemon

225
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:46,999
that you sandwiched between the paper napkin,

226
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,399
the forensic officer has it with him.

227
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,199
A while ago, when I deliberately threw my cigarette down,

228
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,299
the paper napkin that I burnt, is it.

229
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,599
Is that true, forensics officer?

230
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,299
Yes, this is it.

231
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,599
Please take a good look at that paper napkin.

232
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,499
The straight burnt line that extends

233
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,599
is arched part way, isn't it?

234
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,799
That's proof that the lemon was there.

235
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,399
In the same way that heat-fixed invisible ink works.

236
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,199
Only that part burns easily.

237
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,399
Then, where is the poisoned lemon?

238
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,699
I body checked Mrs. Urai,

239
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,399
but didn't find any lemon on her.

240
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,299
It's most likely that

241
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,499
after taking the poisoned lemon out of the president's mouth

242
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:32,799
after he collapsed,

243
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,599
she hid it in between her shoe or something for the time being.

244
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,499
When going to get a body check,

245
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:40,999
she passed beside the table with the glass cups line out.

246
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,799
And she deliberately dropped the iced lemon tea glasses to the floor.

247
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,999
She pretended to sprain her ankle,

248
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,299
removed the lemon from her shoe

249
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,699
and mixed it among the lemons on the floor.

250
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:52,899
I see.

251
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,899
-Then, retrieve that lemon. -Yes, sir.

252
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,899
No.

253
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,499
I've already found it

254
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,099
because Mr. Mouri asked me to look for it.

255
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,199
The lemon that had a part of it cut out,

256
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,299
that had a slight toxic reaction.

257
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:08,699
If the president's saliva

258
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:11,399
as well as the fingerprints of Mr. and Mrs. Urai are found on it...

259
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,399
-It would be conclusive evidence. -Yes.

260
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,999
It was a grudge against sour flavor,

261
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,099
so I chose a lemon.

262
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:25,399
But, it didn't work after all.

263
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,299
It's so difficult to hide.

264
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,499
Grudge against sour flavor?

265
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,799
Yes.

266
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,399
I met my husband at confectionary school.

267
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,999
My husband was a teacher

268
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:40,199
and I was a student.

269
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,999
On a certain day, after several years have passed...

270
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,799
Two people were to enter a sweets making contest from that school,

271
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,699
and I was chosen as one of them.

272
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,299
But, it was obvious who would be champion even before entering.

273
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,699
It was already obvious that the other boy from our school

274
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,099
was going to win.

275
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:02,199
The sour-tasting sweets that he made were truly superb.

276
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,299
People from abroad also came to head hunt him.

277
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,799
However...

278
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:13,999
Who would've thought he would commit suicide a day before the contest.

279
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,299
Back then,

280
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,899
I thought he had worries that got to him because of his genius talent,

281
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,299
so I did my best and won the championship.

282
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,099
Then, why did you say a while ago, that you came in second?

283
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:33,299
Yes, because if he were there, I wouldn't have won.

284
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,099
Then, several years later,

285
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,899
I married my husband who was very happy

286
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,199
that I won the contest.

287
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,399
With that man who drove my boyfriend to his death.

288
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,999
Drove your boyfriend to death?

289
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:53,999
The other day, my husband who got sick over the sour cake confessed

290
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,699
that he hated sour flavor

291
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:57,799
because it reminded him of my boyfriend.

292
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,599
My husband after eating the pie that my boyfriend made before the contest

293
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,299
seems to have told him...

294
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,899
It's too sour.

295
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,899
Are you sure your tongue's okay?

296
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,899
Like so.

297
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,499
Since he trusted my husband completely,

298
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:18,499
he had a nervous breakdown and took his own life.

299
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,999
My husband cried and said that

300
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:23,599
it was to make me win

301
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,499
or that he didn't think the man would die.

302
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,099
He wasn't aware of how much we both loved each other.

303
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,499
You're really something, Mr. Mouri.

304
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:52,199
I had no idea that you deliberately threw down your cigarette.

305
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,599
Oh, well...

306
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,499
Deliberatelsy?

307
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,999
Well, today is White Day,

308
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:02,099
so I thought it'd be better to make everything clear, black or white.

309
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,799
White Day?

310
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,299
I guess I'll call Midori.

311
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
Midori? It's me.

312
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,299
My, Mr. Devil Inspector who loves criminal cases than you love your wife.

313
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,299
Just what did you want with me?

314
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:25,299
Hey! Don't tell me that you're drunk.

315
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,899
How'd you expect me not to get drunk? You octopus head!

316
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,999
Listen well.

317
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,799
In the cabinet next to the refrigerator

318
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,899
on the second from the top shelf...

319
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:45,299
I was actually planning to give it to you after I got home today,

320
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,199
but it seems I going to be late coming home tonight too, so...

321
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:52,399
"To Midori" -Well, it's just a little something from me.

322
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,299
I hope you like it.

323
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:59,399
Oh, and I haven't eaten lunch or dinner today,

324
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,499
so I'd like you to have something ready for me.

325
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,099
Yes, sir!

326
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:13,699
Ran, I'm going to have to go to interrogation after this,

327
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:15,399
so have Officer Takagi take you home.

328
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,399
-Okay. -And, while you're at it...

329
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,199
Stop by at Eri's and drop this off for me.

330
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:27,299
No joke! A White Day gift?

331
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,299
Don't... don't get me wrong!

332
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,599
I actually got this for Yoko but didn't get to give it to her

333
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,799
and I didn't want it to go to waste.

334
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,499
Sure, sure.

335
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:39,499
The wrapper is obviously different from that of Yoko's.

336
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,799
I wonder if Aunty Eri wasn't happy.

337
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,399
Her face looked a bit tense.

338
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,899
She's fine.

339
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:52,299
She was holding back wanting to smile.

340
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,299
It's proof that she's really happy.

341
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,799
And in the meantime, Officer Takagi was...

342
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,699
This is odd. The roads around here...

343
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:03,699
I think I'm lost.

344
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,599
Just look at the car navigator.

345
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,899
You know, the car navigator of this car

346
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,399
is recently not working too well.

347
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,999
No hope,

348
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,899
I guess I'll use the map and navigate you then.

349
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:20,399
What's the street number for the Mouri Detective Agency?

350
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,099
Five-chome.

351
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,699
How bothersome.

352
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,799
"To Miwako"

353
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,299
Hooray! I got my gift for White Day!

354
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,799
I mean, at least check

355
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,999
the glove compartment of your car, will you?

356
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,699
It's been in there from 3 days ago.

357
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,799
"Mouri Detective Agency"

358
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,399
Officer Sato was really happy, wasn't she?

359
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,199
Yeah.

360
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,199
You see, Ran...

361
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,999
Don't worry.

362
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,199
Shinichi is not the type to be concerned about White Day,

363
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,899
so I'll just forget about it, talking with Sonoko

364
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,699
for a long time on the phone.

365
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,599
It's text mail from Sonoko.

366
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,799
I wonder what it is.

367
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,699
I got a White Day gift in return from Makoto!

368
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:16,199
He said he got a white star mark of victory for me!

369
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,299
Oh, no. What shall I do?

370
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,199
I can't call Sonoko up anymore.

371
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,599
Look.

372
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,099
There something in the door post box!

373
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,499
Was there anything in here before we left?

374
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,299
Don't tell me, it's from Shinichi?

375
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,399
"Beika Tax Office" -It can't be.

376
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,199
What could it be?

377
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,899
Did I fail to put something in?

378
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:40,099
The deadline for submission of tax forms is March 15th.

379
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,499
It's tomorrow!

380
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,099
"White Cough Drops"

381
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,599
Cough drops?

382
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,399
Shinichi?

383
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,099
When I called you last time,

384
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,199
you sounded nasal,

385
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,299
so lick this and get well soon.

386
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,899
White Day...

387
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:02,799
I know I shouldn't be expecting anything in return.

388
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,599
But receiving something in return

389
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,199
makes me feel as if my feelings have reached him.

390
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,699
It sure makes me happy.

391
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,599
"Mouri Detective Agency"

392
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,299
Hey, Makoto.

393
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,799
Sonoko.

394
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,999
I'm in the midst of interviewing the victorious team.

395
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:37,099
You mean there's no marshmallow or anything for White Day?

396
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:40,199
Yes, later, right away.

397
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,999
It's White Day

398
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,199
and still things can get "black" and gloomy.

399
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,499
"Next Episode" -Do you know that about five years ago,

400
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:52,699
an extremely rich elderly man named Tsunechika Inubuchi passed away?

401
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,399
Fight over inheritance...

402
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,399
One of the adopted children

403
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:58,599
is an acquaintance of Kazuha's mother

404
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,199
who has a very funny name.

405
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:07,599
It's a demon dog!

406
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,799
Demon dogs really do exists!

407
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,099
Next Conan,

408
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,399
"The Victim is Shinichi Kudo".

409
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,225
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:19,825
"Portable charcoal stove".

411
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,225
What? Shinichi is the victim?

412
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:22,625
No, I don't think it's the Shinichi we know.

413
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,046
-How do you know? -Well...
