1
00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:02.267
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:04.167
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:05.667
An upper classman suddenly disappears.

4
00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:07.167
While we trace her footsteps,

5
00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:09.167
we catch glimpses of a black shadow.

6
00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:10.667
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.467
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.267
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:58.577
The battle with the Black Organization has settled for the time being.

10
00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.177
We were all leading a peaceful school life...

11
00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:08.877
but we got word that Shoko Amemiya, a 4th grader disappeared.

12
00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:12.277
Moreover, she is said to resemble Haibara.

13
00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:17.177
Don't tell me that the Black Organization has come all the way to school?

14
00:02:17.177 --> 00:02:20.477
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

15
00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:23.377
And? Do you remember what she bought?

16
00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:25.377
I think it was...

17
00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:29.877
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

18
00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:33.877
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

19
00:02:33.877 --> 00:02:35.877
but the instant we walked away,

20
00:02:35.877 --> 00:02:38.177
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

21
00:02:38.177 --> 00:02:40.277
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

22
00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:43.177
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

23
00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:45.077
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

24
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:50.777
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

25
00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:55.377
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

26
00:02:55.377 --> 00:02:58.077
Her personality resembles Haibara.

27
00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.977
Maybe...

28
00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:09.377
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 2)"

29
00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:19.077
-Conan? -Conan?

30
00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.877
What're you doing, Conan?

31
00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:46.377
What's he up to?

32
00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:01.977
Conan!

33
00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:22.577
Just as I thought.

34
00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:25.277
There's no doubt about it!

35
00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:27.577
Just what're you doing, Conan?

36
00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:31.377
If you want a PET bottle, I'll give you mine.

37
00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:36.877
Let me call headquarters and ask them to search for the girl!

38
00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:39.177
Wait!

39
00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:40.477
Before that,

40
00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:42.777
how about checking out the place that crossed my mind?

41
00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:45.577
The place that crossed your mind?

42
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.877
Which means that you figured out where she is?

43
00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:49.877
Yeah.

44
00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:54.877
I'm not sure if she's really there yet or not, but let's try going there.

45
00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:57.077
After stopping by at the drugstore though.

46
00:04:57.077 --> 00:04:59.477
The drugstore?

47
00:04:59.477 --> 00:05:01.877
Oh, and Mr. Tanihata.

48
00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:03.377
Yes?

49
00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:07.077
Will you please give me some hot water that you have by the cash register?

50
00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:09.977
Gosh.

51
00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.477
Thanks to you, Conan,

52
00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.977
this is my second time today doing cleaning monitor work.

53
00:05:20.977 --> 00:05:22.477
Hey, Genta!

54
00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:26.177
Cut out playing. Hurry and finish cleaning up!

55
00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:28.977
She already said that twice to me.

56
00:05:28.977 --> 00:05:31.577
Ayumi, did you go get it for me?

57
00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:34.377
Yep! See.

58
00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:35.777
Thank you.

59
00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:37.577
Let's go then!

60
00:05:37.577 --> 00:05:39.677
"Beika Pharmacy"

61
00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:42.777
That'll be 470 yen.

62
00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:44.077
Would you like a package?

63
00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.577
Nope, it's fine just like that.

64
00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:48.977
Okay. Thank you.

65
00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:50.477
What did you buy?

66
00:05:50.477 --> 00:05:52.877
Stick type formula for babies.

67
00:05:52.877 --> 00:05:54.577
Formula...

68
00:05:57.777 --> 00:05:59.977
What are you going to do with that?

69
00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:01.277
Ayumi,

70
00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.677
where's the PET bottle that Genta finished drinking out of?

71
00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:04.677
Here!

72
00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:06.577
The hot water that I had the employee at the convenience store put inside

73
00:06:06.577 --> 00:06:08.077
is still warm.

74
00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:09.077
Thank you.

75
00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:13.577
I pour the formula inside this bottle of hot water.

76
00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:19.377
Then, shake it and mix it well.

77
00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:22.477
Conan, just what are you going to do with it?

78
00:06:22.477 --> 00:06:26.377
Don't tell me that you're going to raise a baby.

79
00:06:27.377 --> 00:06:29.377
Yeah, that's just it.

80
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:37.877
It's no ordinary baby though.

81
00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:39.777
Wait a minute!

82
00:06:39.777 --> 00:06:43.177
We're looking for Shoko Amemiya,

83
00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:48.177
the 4th grade girl who disappeared on her way to school, you know.

84
00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:50.477
Never mind the baby!

85
00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:54.177
I'm sure that the girl couldn't just watch and do nothing either.

86
00:06:55.377 --> 00:06:57.577
Okay, let's have Officer Yumi show us the way then!

87
00:06:59.077 --> 00:07:02.477
To the old warehouse where you planning to go

88
00:07:02.477 --> 00:07:05.177
to issue tickets for illegally parked cars.

89
00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:07.577
Okay.

90
00:07:19.077 --> 00:07:22.777
Hey, are you sure she's in a place like this?

91
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:27.677
Talk about a dirty warehouse.

92
00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:29.977
Cough, it's so dusty.

93
00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:31.577
Right, that's why...

94
00:07:41.277 --> 00:07:43.577
You have weak nasal membranes.

95
00:07:45.977 --> 00:07:48.277
I wasn't always like this though.

96
00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:49.377
Right?

97
00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:50.577
Yes.

98
00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:53.977
Officer Yumi, do you have any pets at home?

99
00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:56.777
Yes, two dogs!

100
00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.077
Sta and Hachi!

101
00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:02.077
You mean you're surrounded by dogs at home, too?

102
00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:04.077
Yes.

103
00:08:04.077 --> 00:08:06.177
Come to think of it, yes.

104
00:08:06.177 --> 00:08:08.377
Then, you just haven't realized

105
00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:10.677
that you're allergic.

106
00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:13.577
Allergic?

107
00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:17.577
Yep. The cause of your sneezes is probably not dust.

108
00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:26.977
Conan, where are you going?

109
00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:30.377
Okay! Let's go, too!

110
00:08:37.977 --> 00:08:39.577
Hey!

111
00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:41.277
I'm going, too!

112
00:08:44.677 --> 00:08:46.377
Wait, you guys!

113
00:08:51.377 --> 00:08:52.677
I'll go!

114
00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:54.777
Ms. Miyamoto.

115
00:09:02.277 --> 00:09:05.277
Are you all okay?

116
00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:07.777
Officer Yumi, this way!

117
00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:09.777
Wait! My butt is stuck.

118
00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:13.277
They're cute!

119
00:09:13.277 --> 00:09:15.077
Cute?

120
00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:23.877
I think the cause of Yumi's sneezes is them.

121
00:09:23.877 --> 00:09:26.977
The cause of my sneezes are the kitten?

122
00:09:26.977 --> 00:09:29.677
Right. It's not dust.

123
00:09:29.677 --> 00:09:33.077
Your reaction was due to the dandruff that they have.

124
00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:36.877
You mean that I'm allergic to cats?

125
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.477
Yep, most probably!

126
00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:43.077
But this place is pretty spacious, and you can't see any dandruff!

127
00:09:43.077 --> 00:09:46.277
Cat dandruff is very small and light!

128
00:09:46.277 --> 00:09:49.377
That's why they go unnoticed

129
00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:51.077
even if they're drifting in the air for a long time!

130
00:09:51.077 --> 00:09:52.677
I see!

131
00:09:52.677 --> 00:09:54.277
The one last thing that the girl and Ai had in common

132
00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.777
that Mitsuhiko wanted to tell us about

133
00:09:56.777 --> 00:10:00.377
was maybe that they both like animals?

134
00:10:00.377 --> 00:10:01.777
Right, that's it!

135
00:10:01.777 --> 00:10:03.277
That's what it was!

136
00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:08.877
Which means that she wanted to walk home with us today

137
00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:11.077
because she wanted to show us these kittens

138
00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:15.077
in hope that someone would take the kittens home with them.

139
00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:16.377
Yeah.

140
00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:19.777
Her parents probably either do not like animals or cats,

141
00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:21.477
so she couldn't tell her parents

142
00:10:21.477 --> 00:10:24.377
and was taking care of them secretly by herself.

143
00:10:24.377 --> 00:10:27.377
Look. She cut off the bottom part of the PET bottle

144
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:30.277
to make a milk container.

145
00:10:30.277 --> 00:10:31.577
I see.

146
00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:32.677
Because back at that convenience store,

147
00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:36.277
they were out of paper plates and cups.

148
00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:41.377
That's why she substituted it by cutting the PET bottle.

149
00:10:41.377 --> 00:10:42.677
Yeah.

150
00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:47.077
Which means that she stayed back in Tokyo without going to Kyushu

151
00:10:47.077 --> 00:10:50.277
to feed these kittens milk.

152
00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:54.177
Then, it's understandable that Shoko would suffer from lack of sleep.

153
00:10:55.477 --> 00:10:59.777
She was probably worried about these kittens and couldn't sleep.

154
00:11:02.477 --> 00:11:04.377
Well, I don't think that was the only reason

155
00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:07.077
she suffered from lack of sleep though.

156
00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:18.577
Hey, why are you throwing the milk away for?

157
00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:21.677
Shoko went through a lot of trouble to get that milk!

158
00:11:21.677 --> 00:11:25.377
Because the problem was this milk!

159
00:11:27.177 --> 00:11:30.577
Cats do not have the enzyme to break down the lactose in milk,

160
00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:31.977
and the nutrients

161
00:11:31.977 --> 00:11:35.377
in the milk of grass-eating cows and meat-eating cats differ.

162
00:11:35.377 --> 00:11:37.577
So if milk is given as is to cats,

163
00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:41.077
it will give them an upset stomach and they may stop drinking all together.

164
00:11:41.077 --> 00:11:43.977
That's if you warm up baby formula for humans

165
00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:50.377
to about 38 degrees and dilute it with 2 parts water and give it to them.

166
00:11:55.077 --> 00:11:56.777
They're drinking, they're drinking!

167
00:11:56.777 --> 00:11:59.177
The fact that the kittens didn't drink the milk

168
00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.777
was one of the things that she was worried about, too!

169
00:12:01.777 --> 00:12:04.377
It seems that she thought that the kittens would drink

170
00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:07.177
if she changed the dirty dishes.

171
00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:08.577
Of course this is an emergency measure

172
00:12:08.577 --> 00:12:13.477
if there are no pet shops nearby and you cannot get milk for cats.

173
00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:15.777
And?

174
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:18.277
Where is the girl,

175
00:12:18.277 --> 00:12:19.477
Shoko Amemiya?

176
00:12:20.777 --> 00:12:22.077
Yeah.

177
00:12:22.077 --> 00:12:23.577
Strange.

178
00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:26.677
I thought she'd still be here because she is worried.

179
00:12:29.777 --> 00:12:31.277
What?

180
00:12:31.277 --> 00:12:32.777
Conan?

181
00:12:32.777 --> 00:12:34.677
I don't know what it is, but...

182
00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:35.777
Let's go!

183
00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:41.277
Not again.

184
00:12:43.677 --> 00:12:45.077
My butt's stuck again.

185
00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:46.477
Where's he going?

186
00:12:46.477 --> 00:12:48.077
Is it this way this time?

187
00:12:49.077 --> 00:12:50.577
My butt hurts.

188
00:12:53.577 --> 00:12:54.677
What?

189
00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.877
There was another one.

190
00:13:00.877 --> 00:13:03.477
There are three all together.

191
00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:05.677
I wonder why only this one was outside.

192
00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:11.977
Now what?

193
00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:16.777
Where is it?

194
00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:34.677
This is...

195
00:13:42.977 --> 00:13:44.577
What's that?

196
00:13:44.577 --> 00:13:46.677
A broken piece of the blinker of a car.

197
00:13:47.977 --> 00:13:52.877
It probably shattered off when it bumped into the telephone pole.

198
00:13:52.877 --> 00:13:55.577
The piece is still brand new,

199
00:13:55.577 --> 00:13:57.277
so I think the accident happened just recently.

200
00:13:57.277 --> 00:14:04.077
But I don't think there were any reports of accidents near here.

201
00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:05.077
Look.

202
00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:07.377
Isn't this...

203
00:14:07.377 --> 00:14:08.777
human blood?

204
00:14:12.877 --> 00:14:16.077
It goes all the way from the telephone pole to in front of the warehouse.

205
00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:17.177
And over here!

206
00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:21.377
There are traces of a car braking.

207
00:14:21.377 --> 00:14:26.077
Could it be that Shoko was run over by a car?

208
00:14:26.077 --> 00:14:29.477
Yeah, we can't really say,

209
00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:31.277
but it's quite likely.

210
00:14:31.277 --> 00:14:32.677
What...

211
00:14:37.982 --> 00:14:40.682
Yeah, I can't say for sure,

212
00:14:40.682 --> 00:14:43.682
but the possibility that a car was involved in some way is high.

213
00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:47.382
Most likely when Shoko carried the kitten,

214
00:14:47.382 --> 00:14:49.282
it slipped out of her hand.

215
00:14:49.282 --> 00:14:50.782
She went after the kitten,

216
00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:52.682
and when she jumped out in the street,

217
00:14:52.682 --> 00:14:54.382
she ran into the car.

218
00:14:57.882 --> 00:14:59.282
Which means...

219
00:14:59.282 --> 00:15:01.282
Is it hit-and-run?

220
00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:06.082
No. If so, the driver would've left the girl behind and fled.

221
00:15:06.082 --> 00:15:08.882
The fact that no report of an accident have not been made yet,

222
00:15:08.882 --> 00:15:11.882
means that there are no eye-witnesses.

223
00:15:11.882 --> 00:15:14.882
If so, where did Shoko go?

224
00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:16.782
Where do these blood stains lead to?

225
00:15:18.382 --> 00:15:20.382
The blood stains return.

226
00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:22.082
They're returning to where they began?

227
00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:24.682
Are the blood stains those of the driver?

228
00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:26.782
If so, the thinkable thing is...

229
00:15:28.282 --> 00:15:29.382
Officer Yumi,

230
00:15:29.382 --> 00:15:31.582
can you check the hospitals in this area?

231
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.682
Okay.

232
00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:44.482
Thank you very much.

233
00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:49.782
Come to think of it, isn't the Niide Hospital near here?

234
00:16:04.582 --> 00:16:06.882
Huh? Conan!

235
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:09.082
Hello...

236
00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:11.582
What brings you all here?

237
00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:12.882
Hey.

238
00:16:12.882 --> 00:16:16.482
Is the owner of the car parked in front of the hospital here?

239
00:16:19.882 --> 00:16:23.882
That man had a wound that required about three stitches,

240
00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.082
in addition to a slight concussion,

241
00:16:26.082 --> 00:16:28.282
so he's still asleep in bed.

242
00:16:28.282 --> 00:16:32.282
Did he mention anything about a girl?

243
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:35.882
Rather, he came carrying her in here.

244
00:16:35.882 --> 00:16:37.382
He came in here smeared with blood saying that he ran over a girl

245
00:16:37.382 --> 00:16:40.682
so he asked for help.

246
00:16:40.682 --> 00:16:42.982
Smeared with blood?

247
00:16:42.982 --> 00:16:44.482
Oh, no.

248
00:16:44.482 --> 00:16:46.982
The man was the one smeared with blood.

249
00:16:49.682 --> 00:16:51.482
The girl

250
00:16:51.482 --> 00:16:53.282
is asleep on the bed over here

251
00:16:53.282 --> 00:16:55.182
and Hikaru is examining her.

252
00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:59.282
Is she hurt?

253
00:16:59.282 --> 00:17:00.382
No.

254
00:17:00.382 --> 00:17:03.282
She's asleep because she didn't have enough sleep.

255
00:17:03.282 --> 00:17:05.682
It seems she didn't sleep at all last night.

256
00:17:06.982 --> 00:17:11.182
She told me so when she woke up a while ago.

257
00:17:11.182 --> 00:17:12.782
She thought she was run over by a car,

258
00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:16.782
fainted and fell asleep.

259
00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:20.482
Then why didn't you contact the school about this?

260
00:17:20.482 --> 00:17:24.482
I did ask for the telephone number of her home and tried calling,

261
00:17:24.482 --> 00:17:26.682
but no one answered.

262
00:17:26.682 --> 00:17:30.082
She went to sleep again before I got to ask her what her name was.

263
00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:34.582
Her school bag seems to have been inside the man's car.

264
00:17:34.582 --> 00:17:38.982
I was thinking of asking her for the details after she got up

265
00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:42.282
because she looked to be so deeply asleep.

266
00:17:42.282 --> 00:17:44.182
But I'm so glad.

267
00:17:45.382 --> 00:17:47.682
I'm glad that Ms. Amemiya is okay.

268
00:17:47.682 --> 00:17:49.082
Really.

269
00:17:50.682 --> 00:17:51.882
What's the matter?

270
00:17:53.182 --> 00:17:56.482
Today was not a good day for me.

271
00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:59.282
I didn't know what I would do if something had happened to her.

272
00:17:59.282 --> 00:18:01.382
Hey, don't cry, Mr. Hirayama.

273
00:18:04.882 --> 00:18:05.982
Excuse me.

274
00:18:05.982 --> 00:18:11.882
I think you should contact the school about this quickly, don't you?

275
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.782
That's right!

276
00:18:13.782 --> 00:18:16.882
My cell phone, phone.

277
00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:19.882
Come on!

278
00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:24.182
It seems that the teacher wasn't one of them.

279
00:18:24.182 --> 00:18:26.982
No, I guess not.

280
00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:29.082
I found it!

281
00:18:30.182 --> 00:18:32.582
Hello. This is Hirayama!

282
00:18:32.582 --> 00:18:34.882
I wonder what is was though.

283
00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:39.382
His gaze. That looked as if he was glaring at us.

284
00:18:39.382 --> 00:18:43.082
Well, since his eyes are bad,

285
00:18:43.082 --> 00:18:45.582
he probably squinted to take a good look.

286
00:18:46.782 --> 00:18:49.882
Which means he's wearing glasses with lens that don't fit his eyes?

287
00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:53.682
He did mention, didn't he?

288
00:18:53.682 --> 00:18:55.782
He fell off the stairs today.

289
00:18:55.782 --> 00:18:58.182
He had a wound on the top part of his eye.

290
00:18:58.182 --> 00:19:02.382
He probably dropped or cracked his contact lens at that time,

291
00:19:02.382 --> 00:19:04.382
so he decided to wear his glasses that he used to use before

292
00:19:04.382 --> 00:19:07.382
with much weaker lens than now for the time being!

293
00:19:07.382 --> 00:19:11.182
Don't you remember? He tried to touch his wound

294
00:19:11.182 --> 00:19:13.682
and his finger pushed his glasses, making them slip.

295
00:19:15.282 --> 00:19:17.782
It's proof that he usually wears contact lens!

296
00:19:18.982 --> 00:19:22.382
I'll bet you want to say that's why his action looked so stupid.

297
00:19:24.382 --> 00:19:25.982
If he were one of them,

298
00:19:25.982 --> 00:19:29.482
isn't there a possibility that he deliberately do so,

299
00:19:29.482 --> 00:19:31.382
to keep us off our guard?

300
00:19:31.382 --> 00:19:34.582
Yeah, that thought raced through my mind for an instant.

301
00:19:34.582 --> 00:19:37.082
But I was convinced that he wasn't one of them

302
00:19:37.082 --> 00:19:40.082
from his remarks that followed.

303
00:19:40.082 --> 00:19:42.182
Who are you children?

304
00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.382
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

305
00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:46.382
That remark convinced me!

306
00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:48.282
How?

307
00:19:48.282 --> 00:19:51.582
An elementary school teacher would usually ask,

308
00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:54.582
"Where are you students from?"

309
00:19:54.582 --> 00:19:58.982
We were all carrying our school bags back then.

310
00:19:58.982 --> 00:20:03.882
The more so if he were one of them disguised as a teacher.

311
00:20:03.882 --> 00:20:05.582
That's how I figured out that he was a teacher

312
00:20:05.582 --> 00:20:08.782
who had lost his contacts and was using glasses just for the time being,

313
00:20:08.782 --> 00:20:12.182
who couldn't see us very well.

314
00:20:12.182 --> 00:20:16.182
But what if he was perfectly acting out his role as that type of teacher?

315
00:20:18.182 --> 00:20:22.082
There's no reason for him to act out such a complicated person.

316
00:20:22.082 --> 00:20:24.082
Besides, if he thoughtlessly happened to say something like that,

317
00:20:24.082 --> 00:20:26.682
he's no enemy.

318
00:20:27.782 --> 00:20:31.782
The ones that I'm afraid of are people like Bellmot...

319
00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:37.882
who sneak up from behind with precise accuracy.

320
00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:07.482
That's what happened today.

321
00:22:07.482 --> 00:22:11.282
I'm glad that the girl Shoko was found.

322
00:22:13.682 --> 00:22:14.982
Shoots.

323
00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:20.482
And? What happened to the kittens?

324
00:22:20.482 --> 00:22:23.882
The new teacher took one,

325
00:22:23.882 --> 00:22:27.682
and Dr. Niide took the other two.

326
00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:30.682
He said he's going to see if any of his patients would be interested.

327
00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:34.182
Dad?

328
00:22:34.182 --> 00:22:36.982
Why don't we take one of the cats?

329
00:22:36.982 --> 00:22:38.582
No way!

330
00:22:38.582 --> 00:22:43.382
It'll scratch the house all over and ruin the rooms!

331
00:22:43.382 --> 00:22:45.582
Besides, if we get a cat,

332
00:22:45.582 --> 00:22:49.582
it could become a big headed woman.

333
00:22:49.582 --> 00:22:51.682
Are you talking about mom?

334
00:22:51.682 --> 00:22:54.282
I wonder.

335
00:22:54.282 --> 00:22:58.282
Besides, we don't need any more new free loaders.

336
00:22:58.282 --> 00:22:59.982
Gosh.

337
00:22:59.982 --> 00:23:01.482
Oh, right!

338
00:23:01.482 --> 00:23:04.982
Talking about new, today at school...

339
00:23:04.982 --> 00:23:06.482
Hey, Conan.

340
00:23:06.482 --> 00:23:07.982
Conan, listen too.

341
00:23:10.882 --> 00:23:12.282
Are you asleep?

342
00:23:12.282 --> 00:23:14.482
I guess so much happened today that you're tired.

343
00:23:17.882 --> 00:23:22.082
And? Did a new teacher come to your school, too?

344
00:23:22.082 --> 00:23:24.182
Nope, a new student.

345
00:23:24.182 --> 00:23:25.882
A boy came.

346
00:23:28.982 --> 00:23:33.682
He looks a lot like that announcer, Reina Mizunashi!

347
00:23:33.682 --> 00:23:36.982
He said that he has nothing to do with her and that he just looks like her.

348
00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.682
He said that he wants to come to our place once,

349
00:23:38.682 --> 00:23:40.182
so I'll introduce him to you when he does!

350
00:23:44.782 --> 00:23:46.682
"Next Episode" -A boy?

351
00:23:46.682 --> 00:23:49.882
Huh? Wasn't she supposed to be a high school girl

352
00:23:49.882 --> 00:23:52.082
who resembled Reina Mizunashi the announcer?

353
00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:54.482
No, Pops!

354
00:23:56.982 --> 00:24:01.182
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning

355
00:24:01.182 --> 00:24:03.582
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

356
00:24:03.582 --> 00:24:07.582
No. This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

357
00:24:07.582 --> 00:24:09.282
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

358
00:24:09.282 --> 00:24:14.782
Next Conan, "The Point of No Return (Part 1)"

359
00:24:15.567 --> 00:24:17.667
Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:19.967
"Bad sleeping posture"

361
00:24:19.967 --> 00:24:21.967
