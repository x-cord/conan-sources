1
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,809
Come on.

2
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,715
Well, that was a fun thing that happened.

3
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,018
Let's bring our attention back to the main event.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,123
(Shinpo Yokoyama (28), Office Worker)

5
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,431
Thank you for your patience.

6
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,800
Here comes the bride.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,007
(Sayoko Imamura (24), Domestic Helper)

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,002
I can't breathe.

9
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,103
What's going on?

10
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,304
Sayoko!

11
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,817
Sayoko! Sayoko!

12
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,719
Calm down, Shinpo. Call the ambulance!

13
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,821
Okay.

14
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,225
It's no use. She's already dead.

15
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,327
It is now 1:22 p.m.

16
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,129
Sayoko.

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,431
(Hiroko Nagashima (23), Wedding Planner)
Why?

18
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,690
(Hiroko Nagashima (23), Wedding Planner)
Why does she have to die now?

19
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,003
(Alex Harutoshi Kawasu (58), Pastor)
She died too soon.

20
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,705
(Alex Harutoshi Kawasu (58), Pastor)
She was so young.

21
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,690
She died at the right time.

22
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:49,809
(Gakuto Yamada (27), Office Worker)

23
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,890
(Gakuto Yamada (27), Office Worker)
In that case, I'll be...

24
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,960
(Naho Mizuguchi (23), Office Worker)
She got what she deserved.

25
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,930
(Naho Mizuguchi (23), Office Worker)
In fact, I thought she got it too late.

26
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,220
If only we realised it sooner.

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,121
(Nobuteru Yokoyama (57), Office Executive)
This marriage

28
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,640
(Nobuteru Yokoyama (57), Office Executive)
is indeed cursed!

29
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,628
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

30
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,330
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

31
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,332
Why have the words of promise disappeared

32
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,400
during the climax of the happiest day ever?

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,002
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,804
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,206
His name is Detective Conan!

36
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:07,914
"Until Death Do Us Part"

37
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,824
So, why were you here at the murder scene?

38
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,226
Well, I happened to know the bride's father

39
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,528
through the bar I usually go to.

40
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,232
You were invited to the wedding
at the spur of the moment,

41
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,530
weren't you?

42
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,902
And now we have an incident
on our hands again.

43
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,605
Trouble seems to find you as always.

44
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,507
I'm sorry for that.

45
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,710
There aren't any wounds
that stand out in particular.

46
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,513
The victim's name is Sayoko Imamura.

47
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,317
She's 24 years old and
works as a domestic helper.

48
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:49,522
The time of death is 1:22 p.m.,
as you observed.

49
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,126
According to forensics,
her death is caused by poison.

50
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,140
What kind of poison was it?

51
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,131
They detected a substance in her body

52
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,950
that can be found in poisonous mushrooms.

53
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,001
It can cause whole-body paralysis and death

54
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:07,206
in about an hour
after ingesting even a small amount.

55
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,309
In an hour?

56
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,813
In that case,
whoever gave the bride anything to eat or drink

57
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,115
is a suspect.

58
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,917
(Waiting Room for Personnel)
This is Hiroko Nagashima,

59
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,820
(Waiting Room for Personnel)
the wedding planner.

60
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,923
You seem to have given Imamura water to drink.

61
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,326
It's my job to support the bride.

62
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,129
Giving water to drink
is also part of the job.

63
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,331
I stick a straw into the plastic bottle

64
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:34,801
and let her sip the water a little at a time

65
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,003
while taking care not to destroy the make-up.

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,605
I heard that you were pushed around a lot

67
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,008
while preparing for this wedding.

68
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,310
I'll admit that she was so troublesome that

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,912
I almost wanted to kill her.

70
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,214
The schedule was strict to the minute,

71
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,316
and she tried to fit everything into it.

72
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,417
Just look at this!

73
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,720
I don't even have time to breathe with this!

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,320
(1:25 p.m., the bride appears. 1:30 p.m.,
scripture reading)

75
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,324
She was unsatisfied with many of
the points of the wedding reception

76
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,326
and asked to change
the colour of the napkins

77
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,929
before asking to change them back
the next day.

78
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,420
She was the definition of a selfish princess!

79
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,901
When you said you almost wanted to kill her,
do you mean...

80
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,104
I didn't do it.

81
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,606
I mean, if I did, all the hard work that

82
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,409
I put into this wedding would go to waste.

83
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,613
Everything went to waste in the end, though.

84
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,116
You said, "why does she have to die now?"

85
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,118
What did you mean by that?

86
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,520
I was waiting for
the fireworks effects to go off

87
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,123
after the bride walked down the aisle.

88
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,725
I had a hard time getting permission for that.

89
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:37,230
By the way, whose dog was it
that barged onto the aisle?

90
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,232
It's Yokoyama's.

91
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,601
We planned on having it
as the ring bearer.

92
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,102
Ring bearer?

93
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,204
It's someone who brings
the wedding rings down the aisle.

94
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,808
These days, even dogs
are assigned the role.

95
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,613
What do you want with me?

96
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,214
Gakuto Yamada.

97
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,617
He's friends with Shinpo, the groom.

98
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,418
They both work for the same company.

99
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:03,322
We heard you went to the bride's waiting room
before the ceremony.

100
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,324
What did you do there?

101
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,227
I'm Shinpo's friend,
but at the same time,

102
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,030
I am also a friend of Sayoko's.

103
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,700
I went to personally offer her
my congratulations.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,703
Did you give her anything to eat?

105
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,405
Nothing at all.

106
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:23,050
But I did give her something to drink.

107
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,660
It's this thing.

108
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,312
Is it an alcoholic drink?

109
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,615
That's right. I always carry it around.

110
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,518
She asked for a sip to cheer herself up.

111
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,623
Will you let us examine the hip flask?

112
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,225
Yes, of course.

113
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,828
Hey, mister.

114
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:46,432
You said she died at the right time
when she fell over.

115
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,301
What did you mean?

116
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,603
So you heard it, huh?

117
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,605
What did you mean by those words?

118
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,709
I shouldn't be saying this in front of a kid.

119
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,711
Sayoko and I were...

120
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,815
Conan, my pen ran out of ink.

121
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,718
Could you ask anyone in the wedding hall
if they could lend me one?

122
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,921
Okay. I'll go and get one for you.

123
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,524
It's fine.

124
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,226
Please continue.

125
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:17,530
Sure. I'd appreciate it
if you could keep this a secret from Shinpo.

126
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,700
But she and I were dating each other.

127
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,502
With the knowledge that
the two of them were getting married.

128
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,905
You got her to cheat on him.

129
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,007
It was all Sayoko's doing.

130
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,109
By "dying at the right time," I meant that

131
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:35,615
I could run to some new girlfriend
now that she's gone.

132
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,417
What's with that excuse?

133
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,321
This is Nobuteru Yokoyama,

134
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,323
the groom's father.

135
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,826
Please accept my condolences.

136
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:51,230
Good grief. Why is this happening?

137
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,301
You went to the bride's waiting room
before the ceremony, didn't you?

138
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,502
I did.

139
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,805
I heard her parents had died,

140
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,709
so I thought I could stand in for her family.

141
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,314
I found out she loved chocolate,
and I gave her some as a present.

142
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,817
I'd love to eat it right now,
but I just had my nails done.

143
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,819
Feed me, Father.

144
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,121
But...

145
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,424
We're pretty much father and daughter.
It's fine.

146
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,932
Her death was caused by poison.

147
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,133
No way!

148
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,602
I never put any poison in that chocolate.

149
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,405
We're still asking everyone
about what happened.

150
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,106
Don't worry about it.

151
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,711
Mister, you said this before, right?

152
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,013
"If only we realised it sooner."

153
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,617
"This marriage is indeed cursed!"

154
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,519
You heard that?

155
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,424
I actually hired a detective to
investigate the matter for me.

156
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,127
The results weren't very good.

157
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,729
What do you mean?

158
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,832
Sayoko had an extensive history of picking up men

159
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,001
since her student days.

160
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,504
I once tried to tell my son about it discreetly,

161
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,807
but he wouldn't listen to me.

162
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,810
They do say that love is blind.

163
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,514
It wasn't me!

164
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,418
Mizuguchi, when the bride fell over,

165
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,720
you seem to have whispered that

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,723
she got what she deserved
and that she got it too late.

167
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,926
I've been friends with Sayoko
since we were in school,

168
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,730
but she was always going out
with one boy after another.

169
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,401
I said it because I knew something terrible
would happen to her someday.

170
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,604
Do you know of anyone who would resent her?

171
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,108
There were so many that I couldn't tell! Right?

172
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:52,818
I saw the groom's father
feeding the bride some chocolate.

173
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,421
I was walking past the bride's waiting room

174
00:10:55,421 --> 00:11:00,526
when I glimpsed
what was inside through the open door.

175
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,429
When did you see that?

176
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,932
If I recall, it was around 12:45 p.m.

177
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:11,103
Nagashima last gave her a drink
at 12:50 p.m.

178
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:15,207
But it seems that she had water often,

179
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,110
so it's difficult to pinpoint a specific time.

180
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,516
And Yamada let her drink from his hip flask
at about 12:20 p.m.

181
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,217
If I remember correctly, the poison...

182
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,220
According to forensics,
the poison circulates within the body

183
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,122
and causes death in an hour.

184
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,825
An hour ago. That means...

185
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,427
it's the hip flask.

186
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,828
It could be.

187
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:40,533
However, Yamada willingly submitted
his hip flask for investigation.

188
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,003
Pastor Kawasu.

189
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,304
What is it?

190
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,208
It's about what you said
when the bride fell over.

191
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,910
It's just as I said.

192
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,715
A girl as young as her
shouldn't have died so soon.

193
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,017
Yes, you're right.

194
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,821
The data has been uploaded.

195
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,526
Takagi, the forensics results are in.

196
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,928
How was it?

197
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,630
There was nothing wrong with
the plastic bottle or the hip flask.

198
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,501
But they detected mushroom poison
in the chocolates.

199
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,802
That can't be!

200
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:21,807
Mister, why did you
give the bride those chocolates?

201
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,409
Well...

202
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,112
During the rehearsal,

203
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,716
Sayoko talked about
how much she loved Mativa chocolates.

204
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,919
I bought the chocolates
at a department store

205
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,621
and gifted them to her.

206
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,824
But why were the department store chocolates
spiked with poison?

207
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,327
Even if you ask me...

208
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,130
- This settles it, then.
- Right.

209
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,531
Hold on a second.

210
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,133
What is it, kid?

211
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,102
Would he poison the gifted chocolates

212
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,906
if he knew he would be suspected?

213
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,111
If the father of the groom opposed the marriage,

214
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,014
he would have used a different method
to protest against it.

215
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,117
It looks like you have to keep investigating.

216
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,222
The crime is motivated by a grudge
against the bride.

217
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,224
I need to go to the toilet!

218
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,828
(Bride's Waiting Room)

219
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,932
This is the bride's waiting room.

220
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,306
If you exit the waiting room and turn left,

221
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,208
you'll find the lift landing.

222
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,712
On the other side of the lift landing
is the waiting room for guests.

223
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,014
Nobody's here.

224
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,620
Poor thing. You're all alone here.

225
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,260
What's this?

226
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,620
The lead has been cut.

227
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,980
(Waiting Room for Personnel)
It looks like I'm not mistaken.

228
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,590
Hey, miss.

229
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,300
What is it?

230
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,804
I wanted to see the schedule
for the wedding ceremony again.

231
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,905
I don't mind.

232
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,508
- Here.
- Thank you.

233
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,410
(1:25 p.m., the bride appears)
Let's see.

234
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,212
I knew it.

235
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:11,116
The wedding ceremony didn't
start as planned on the schedule.

236
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,518
Why is that?

237
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,919
That's the thing!

238
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,423
The groom lost one of his shoes right
before it started.

239
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,425
We found it in the toilet eventually,

240
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,060
but everything was delayed by five minutes.

241
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,530
What a slow reaction.

242
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,400
You came here early this morning
to get things ready, right?

243
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,690
I've been here since 6 a.m.

244
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,807
There were
so many things to do that I lost track of them.

245
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,508
But even though I came early...

246
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,210
The dog escaped to the aisle too early,

247
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,912
and the groom lost his shoe.

248
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,915
Things just didn't go to plan.

249
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,818
The wedding ended partway in the first place, too.

250
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,326
The detailed schedule
is the key to this incident.

251
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,302
That's it! So that's how it is!

252
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,405
I get it now. I know who the culprit is.

253
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:16,615
Officer Takagi, Uncle Kogoro told me
he wanted something investigated.

254
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,922
Detective Mouri,
we've gathered everyone like you asked.

255
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,724
Huh? But I...

256
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,728
I guess I did ask.

257
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,632
So this is Sleeping Kogoro!

258
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,501
It's my first time seeing it.

259
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,703
We can say that the point of this incident

260
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:43,008
is the strong desire for
revenge on Sayoko Imamura.

261
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:49,315
Killing her on her wedding day
would be shocking enough,

262
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,017
but the culprit waited for
the most dramatic moment

263
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,620
to take her life.

264
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,023
They were likely waiting for the moment
the bride and groom would kiss.

265
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,426
Is that even possible?

266
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,428
They failed in the execution.

267
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:07,032
But the culprit back-calculated the time
so that it could happen.

268
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,801
So that's why they used
the mushroom poison.

269
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,902
That's right.

270
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,004
The ingredient in the poisonous mushroom

271
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,407
causes death after about an hour of ingesting

272
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,909
even a small amount.

273
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,811
So that's how it is.

274
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,113
It would be the perfect revenge tragedy

275
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,316
if she had died at the happiest point in her life.

276
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,420
Isn't that right, Alex Harutoshi Kawasu?

277
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,323
It was the pastor?

278
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,428
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

279
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:42,901
You were the only person
who knew about the Mativa chocolates

280
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,404
and was able to switch them out.

281
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,607
Nobuteru found out
that the bride loved chocolates

282
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,110
at the wedding rehearsal.

283
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,713
You were at the rehearsal too, weren't you?

284
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:59,218
In that case, Nagashima was also there
as the wedding planner.

285
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,222
Nobuteru, when did you buy the chocolates?

286
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,225
Today. I went to
a department store in Beika-cho

287
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,626
to buy them before coming here.

288
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,260
I see.

289
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,230
Even if you knew
what kind of chocolates they were,

290
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,630
you would need to see him buying them
before you bought the same ones.

291
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,706
That was why you tailed Nobuteru.

292
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:25,210
Once you were sure of
which chocolates he bought,

293
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,713
you purchased the same chocolates yourself.

294
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,716
You spiked the chocolates

295
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,118
with the poison
you had prepared beforehand

296
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,421
and waited for an opportunity
to switch them out

297
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,322
with the ones Nobuteru had.

298
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,125
Then, you made sure that

299
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,928
Nobuteru fed the chocolates to the bride

300
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,030
and hoped it would happen
at the wedding ceremony.

301
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,632
Isn't that right?

302
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,600
Have a look at this.

303
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,702
- Conan!
- Yes!

304
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,905
Here.

305
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,307
It's the schedule for the wedding ceremony.

306
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,609
When you look at it like this,
it's quite amazing.

307
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,612
The schedule is detailed to the minute.

308
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:04,817
The victim ate the chocolates at 12:45 p.m.

309
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,819
The groom lost his shoe

310
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,520
and the chihuahua barged onto the aisle,

311
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,023
which resulted in a delay of about 10 minutes.

312
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,127
In that case,
if we add 10 minutes to the schedule,

313
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,931
1:45 p.m. would've been...

314
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,190
(The Kiss of Oath)
The time for the bride and groom to kiss!

315
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,002
So that was why you hid the groom's shoe!

316
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,804
Kawasu also tampered with the dog's lead

317
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,507
and caused it to barge onto the aisle.

318
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,211
By doing that, he could delay
the schedule little by little

319
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:36,400
so that he could adjust
the timing of the bride falling over.

320
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,619
Why would I have to do that?

321
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,122
We investigated you
at Detective Mouri's orders.

322
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,225
You once had a son.

323
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,028
He went to the same university as Sayoko

324
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,600
and seemed to have been
in a relationship with her.

325
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,503
Apparently, they had a difficult breakup
during their fourth year,

326
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:02,107
and he died in a traffic accident
a few months later.

327
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,710
Taking the testimonies
against the victim into account,

328
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,814
one could easily imagine
that your son had a very hard time.

329
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,519
I can say it makes enough of
a motive for revenge.

330
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,421
You investigated it thoroughly.

331
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:21,126
I sensed a strong feeling of revenge
in the motive for this incident.

332
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,830
Moreover, you were the only person

333
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,101
who could look at
what was inside Nagashima's schedule

334
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,203
and switch the chocolates out.

335
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,407
I see. So that's how it is.

336
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,309
One more thing.

337
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,212
You still have the chocolates on you, right?

338
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,516
It's hard to believe that you would
throw them away somewhere.

339
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,520
Kawasu, you thought in your own way that

340
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,524
it was the safest place to hide them.

341
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,426
You're a man of the church.

342
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,529
And you're very confident in your position.

343
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,832
Confident that you won't be subjected to
security checks and the like.

344
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:10,809
That wench played with my son
and drove him to his death,

345
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,811
but she didn't even show up to his funeral.

346
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,515
I couldn't let her get married

347
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,117
with a blissful expression on her face

348
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,720
when she did the evilest deed imaginable.

349
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,926
I poisoned her so that she would die
at the happiest point of her life.

350
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,331
But she died before the kiss!

351
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,500
The poison should've taken effect after an hour.

352
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,504
You said at the beginning

353
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,907
that she died too soon.

354
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,520
She died too soon.

355
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,560
She was so young.

356
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,915
You panicked and added the second sentence,

357
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,317
but the words "too soon"
referred to the fact that

358
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,420
she succumbed to the poison too soon.

359
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,924
The moment I realised the true meaning,

360
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,927
I was convinced that you were the culprit.

361
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,131
Sleeping Kogoro.

362
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,800
I am impressed by that discerning eye of yours.

363
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,803
And thank you.

364
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,607
Forgive us our sins,

365
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,510
as we forgive those who sin against us.

366
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,614
- No!
- You think you can kill yourself? Stop it!

367
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,316
He was just a parent who cared about his son.

368
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,723
If Ran were to get married,

369
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,627
I guess I'd cry.

370
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,530
You would cry, Uncle Kogoro?

371
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:30,809
Yeah, I'd cry
while giving a groom a right beating

372
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,511
and throw him over the shoulder!

373
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,213
Another bottle, please!

374
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,615
Ran!

375
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,818
I won't ever let you get married!

376
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:44,620
Daddy will never let you get married!

377
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Attention all shop owners
in Bondo Shopping District!

378
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,500
Here comes the moment
you've been waiting for!

379
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,600
There is only one way to win!

380
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
The Victorious Diamond shining on her chest!

381
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,900
- The female pro wrestler!
- Sorry?

382
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,820
There's no way anyone
would fight a pro wrestler...

383
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,500
This is pointless!

384
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Falls aren't in play yet.

385
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,900
Next Conan,

386
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,900
"The Shopping District Is in Love"

387
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,900
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,960
"A pro wrestling tournament"

389
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,700
It's Christmas next week!

390
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,600
A pro wrestling tournament on Christmas?

391
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Yes.
