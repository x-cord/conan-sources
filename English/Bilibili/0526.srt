"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,940
"A man working at a securities company is killed in his condo."

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,440
"The murder weapon is a hunting rifle."

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,740
"The police is investigating the case as murder from a grudge."

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,440
But, how frightening,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,640
that condo is near here, isn't it?

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,540
The culprit could be hiding anywhere nearby...

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,040
Azusa?

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,540
"Azusa Enomoto (23)" -I'm sorry.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,940
I'll make a new one and bring it right away!

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,940
Are you all right? You look pale.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,340
Really?

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,540
Come to think of it,

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,140
"Sugihito Enomoto (28)" -your older brother

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,240
also practices shooting, doesn't he?

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,940
What does that have to do with anything?

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,240
Sugihito does sporting clays, not rifle hunting.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,640
But it looks like there are a lot of people here with scary faces

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
who suspect that he's involved.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,340
Now that you mentioned it,

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,540
there are a lot of people

22
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,040
with threatening looks on their faces in this shop.

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,740
Some of the guys look sort of familiar, too.

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,940
The person sitting there at the counter

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,840
looks exactly like a man I know.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,740
If I'm not mistaken, aren't you...

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,940
Officer Takagi. What're you doing?

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,940
A crisis is gracefully revived.

29
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,240
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,940
Coffee Shop Poirot is full of police officers.

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,040
The parcel that is delivered is full of mystery.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,540

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,640
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:18,137
"A Delivery From The Real Culprit"

36
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:22,237
What? Sugihito is being suspected?

37
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,237
You mean about this securities businessman's case?

38
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,437
Yes. The victim, Mr. Takafumi Torihira

39
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:31,137
is Azusa's older brother, Sugihito's boss.

40
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:33,137
And his fingerprints were found

41
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:35,137
on the rifle left back at the scene of the crime.

42
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:38,637
Moreover, when we went to his apartment, no one was there,

43
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:41,337
and he seems to have been absent from work without contacting the company.

44
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:44,337
We're staking out here because he may just contact

45
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,337
his younger sister.

46
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,237
I see.

47
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:51,437
And? Did your brother contact you?

48
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,237
I already told the officers too.

49
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:57,037
Yes, just once, telling me not to worry.

50
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,837
Besides, he told me that he's innocent

51
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,437
and hasn't done anything!

52
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:05,137
Exactly.

53
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,237
I'm sure it's a mistake.

54
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,737
Who are you?

55
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:12,537
"Touji Kawase (28)" -He's Mr. Kawase,

56
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,337
who works with my brother.

57
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,637
I came by here on business, so I stopped by.

58
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:21,037
The fingerprints that were found on the rifle,

59
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:24,137
were they really Sugihito's prints?

60
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,137
Yeah, no doubt about it.

61
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,137
That's probably because 4 or 5 members from our company

62
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,637
including him went to Mr. Torihira's condo the other day,

63
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,137
and were shown a rifle there.

64
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:36,837
Maybe that's why they found his fingerprints on it.

65
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:39,737
Back then, he was touching the rifle with great interest

66
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,337
and even looked into the gun barrel.

67
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,737
Why with great interest?

68
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:47,337
He also does sporting clay, doesn't he?

69
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,037
No, shotguns are used in sporting clay.

70
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,337
He was excited saying that

71
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:54,437
it was the first time he ever touched a hunting rifle.

72
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:55,837
Excited?

73
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,737
But, it doesn't seem your brother had anything against this Mr. Torihira

74
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:03,137
because he obviously went over to spend time at his house.

75
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,837
No, brother used to tell me

76
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:08,337
that he was a very strict boss, but a good person.

77
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:09,937
Strict?

78
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:13,137
It seems that Mr. Torihira took special notice of Enomoto

79
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:15,737
because he was competent.

80
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:18,537
Enomoto was frequently scolded severely by Mr. Torihira

81
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:21,137
in front of everyone else.

82
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,237
Well, I guess you could call it "strictness born from love".

83
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,337
If the prints just coincidentally got on the rifle,

84
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:29,837
why did he have to flee?

85
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,637
Moreover, it seems that

86
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,037
he made it out of his apartment in an extreme rush.

87
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,237
An extreme rush?

88
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:38,337
Yeah. The front door was left unlocked,

89
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:41,937
and even his cash card and wallet were left behind.

90
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:45,837
And, those aren't the only things he left behind upon fleeing.

91
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,337
At a trash dump near his apartment,

92
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,637
we found his dress shirt

93
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:53,337
that was smeared with an unbelievable amount of blood on it.

94
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:54,937
Oh, no!

95
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,137
And, that blood was...

96
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:01,937
Yes, it was found to be Mr. Torihira's blood through DNA tests.

97
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:05,837
But, how did you find out it was Sugihito's dress shirt?

98
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:08,337
His fingerprints were also found

99
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,737
on the buttons of that shirt.

100
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,337
I have a picture of it too.

101
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:15,937
Does it look familiar?

102
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:17,437
I can't say...

103
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:19,537
It look like a dress shirt that can be found anywhere, so...

104
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,037
May I see it too?

105
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:23,037
Conan.

106
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,537
This is...

107
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,437
I guess I'll be heading back to the company then.

108
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:30,337
It's an hour drive from here,

109
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:32,037
so it's about time I get going.

110
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:35,737
Oh, yes. Your company's in Kanagawa.

111
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,137
If he ever contacts you,

112
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:40,237
let me know by mail, okay?

113
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:44,237
I'll try to convince him to stop running around and go to the police.

114
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,637
If he happens to get caught while on the run,

115
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:49,237
he may be set up as the culprit, besides.

116
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,937
Okay.

117
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,637
See you.

118
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,437
Thank you for coming all this way.

119
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:02,237
Was that man a good friend of your brother?

120
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,837
Yep. It seems that they started working for the same section

121
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,837
of the company from last month

122
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,137
and suddenly became friends.

123
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,437
I heard that he recently used to stay over at Sugihito's place a lot.

124
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:14,337
After all, his apartment is near the company.

125
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,237
Oh, I see.

126
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:22,037
I'm sorry that we police officers are intruding on you like this too.

127
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:24,437
Oh, not at all. If I'm going to be watched either way,

128
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:27,337
it doesn't matter if it's from the inside or outside.

129
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:32,337
And I'd also like to prove that my brother isn't the culprit.

130
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:37,137
Just as I thought your room would be, Azusa.

131
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,637
It's cute.

132
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:40,837
You think so?

133
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,237
What a load of gifts too!

134
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,037
Are these from the patrons of Poiroit?

135
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:48,237
No. They're all from my brother.

136
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,637
He frequently buys queer gifts on his business trips

137
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,037
and sends them to me.

138
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,837
Talking about sending me stuff,

139
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:59,337
he also sends me queer pictures taken on his cell.

140
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:02,037
Even last night,

141
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:04,637
he sent me this strange photo.

142
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,137
Snow?

143
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,637
Did it snow last night?

144
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,637
I guess it snowed quite a bit,

145
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,937
where my brother's apartment is.

146
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:16,137
Brother said he also sent it to Mr. Kawase.

147
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,137
But, can you imagine a person

148
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,537
who sends pictures like this killing somebody?

149
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:22,437
True.

150
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,337
Besides, brother told me when he called me this morning

151
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:28,837
that he uses a shotgun for sporting clay,

152
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:30,537
and that handling a hunting rifle

153
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,737
is not easy.

154
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:36,237
Well, about handling and stuff, it was...

155
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:39,437
A guest?

156
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:42,037
Were you expecting anyone?

157
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,437
No.

158
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:45,937
Which means...

159
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:48,537
Don't tell me it's...

160
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:52,837
Hello, delivery.

161
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,737
What is it?

162
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:56,337
Nothing.

163
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,537
Who is it from?

164
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:02,637
It's from Mr. Sugihito Enomoto.

165
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:05,037
Brother.

166
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:08,137
I hope you don't mind me checking the contents.

167
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:09,937
Go ahead.

168
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:21,537
-Here. -Thank you.

169
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:27,137
It's assorted cookies.

170
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:31,637
Hey, maybe there's a letter or something inside?

171
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:36,237
It doesn't look to be so.

172
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:40,637
Azusa, do the cookies bring anything to mind?

173
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:43,537
Azusa?

174
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:44,837
The cookies?

175
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:49,337
I love cookies, I think that's why he sent it to me.

176
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:52,937
See. The more he can't be a person would kill, right?

177
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:54,837
True.

178
00:09:56,837 --> 00:10:01,537
Oh, that's right. I have to go out shopping now.

179
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:06,237
To the neighborhood supermarket to buy groceries and a few other things.

180
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,237
Would you like to come along?

181
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:10,237
Oh, yes, of course.

182
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,537
The person who first found the corpse

183
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:17,337
was Mrs. Torihira who came back this morning from a trip.

184
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:19,537
Yes, the estimated time of murder is

185
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:24,037
probably between 22:00 - 23:00 last night.

186
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:26,637
Yes, right. Just around that time last night,

187
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,037
I had a hell of a time.

188
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,237
Hell of a time?

189
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:32,037
I had to go to the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department

190
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,037
but the freeway was blocked

191
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:36,637
and the trains were delayed too.

192
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,337
An accident or something?

193
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,737
No, not an accident.

194
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:45,237
Yes, this is Chiba.

195
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:48,437
Oh, Officer Takagi. What is it?

196
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,937
Azusa split on you?

197
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,937
Yeah, a message saying where to meet him

198
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,637
was in the box of cookies she received a while ago, after all.

199
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:59,637
It can't be! There was no message in it.

200
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:03,637
No, a message was definitely written there.

201
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:07,137
In an unexpected place that only Azusa would notice.

202
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:11,237
Moreover, the person who sent it wasn't Sugihito,

203
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,937
but most probably the real culprit.

204
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:18,137
He probably called Azusa to conceal everything.

205
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,637
That person who from his own side,

206
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:24,237
called himself a murderer through the slip of his tongue.

207
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,071
You idiot!

208
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,271
Accompanying the younger sister of the suspect,

209
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,871
and yet letting her get away from you. What do you think you're doing?

210
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,571
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:46,671
Ms. Enomoto, previously cooperated in solving cases

212
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,571
so I didn't think she would flee.

213
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:52,571
The one that is suspected of killing Mr. Torihira

214
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,171
is Azusa's older brother, Sugihito Enomoto.

215
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,971
The more she's a good younger sister,

216
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:00,871
the more she would want to help her brother who is in trouble.

217
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:03,271
Didn't that dawn on you?

218
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:05,671
What would you have done then, Inspector?

219
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:06,871
She told me that she wanted to go

220
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:11,271
to the underwear section to shop, so to wait a while.

221
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,171
I would've gone along with her anyway.

222
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:15,371
What if she says it's okay to go with her,

223
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,471
but to not watch her too closely

224
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,171
when she's choosing underwear!

225
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:23,371
If she says that with a slightly

226
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:24,371
troubled blushing face?

227
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,271
Then what?

228
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,171
Well, then I would have no choice.

229
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:30,271
Azusa pretty shrewd, isn't she?

230
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,571
Yep.

231
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:36,171
Come on. Stuff like that doesn't matter at this point!

232
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,571
The problem here is that

233
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:41,071
we've completely lost track of the suspect.

234
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,871
But, Inspector,

235
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,071
is Sugihito really the culprit?

236
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:48,671
His fingerprints were found on the murder weapon,

237
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,871
the rifle, and on top of that he's on the run right now.

238
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,271
And, furthermore, the blood smeared dress shirt

239
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:55,071
that was found in trash box.

240
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:58,071
The blood that had splattered is Mr. Torihira's blood

241
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,771
and the fingerprints of Sugihito Enomoto

242
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,971
have also been found on the buttons of the dress shirt.

243
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,071
I guess we can say

244
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,771
there's a 10 to 1 chance that he's the culprit.

245
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:08,371
Oh, no!

246
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,371
Hey, Conan, just what do you think you're doing?

247
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:15,171
I got thirsty so I wanted to get the coke in the refrigerator.

248
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,871
But, the coke gushed out.

249
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:22,571
Huh? My elbows and underarms aren't all that wet.

250
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:25,971
It's probably because you opened the can with your arms fixed in place.

251
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,171
I see.

252
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,671
Armpits close against the body...

253
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:33,371
Inspector, there's something strange about this dress shirt.

254
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,571
What's strange about it?

255
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:38,371
Take a look at this, the armpit and elbow part.

256
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:41,371
Blood is splattered evenly and also on these parts.

257
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:44,071
Judging from the large amount of blood that is splattered on the shirt,

258
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:47,471
the rifle must've been fired from point blank range.

259
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,871
In other words, the culprit didn't have to look through the scope,

260
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,071
but rather just held it under his arm and fired.

261
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:54,971
If so, the blood that would've splattered on the sides

262
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,071
and elbows should've been blocked.

263
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,971
However, since the dress shirt is bloody all over,

264
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,271
that's what somebody probably set up.

265
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:05,271
No, it's only natural that the shirt is bloody all over.

266
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:08,871
Mr. Torihira wasn't shot with the rifle,

267
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:12,871
but rather, struck to death with the handle part.

268
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:14,271
Is that so?

269
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,971
I also thought that he was shot with a rifle too.

270
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:22,771
But, there was somebody who said exactly that, wasn't there?

271
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:26,771
Remember, Sugihito's colleague at work called Mr. Kawase.

272
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:31,471
He said that Sugihito was looking with interest into the gun barrel.

273
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,971
In other words, he wanted to say

274
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,571
that Sugihito's fingerprints are on the rifle, right?

275
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,571
It seems to be true that the culprit held the part of the rifle

276
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,171
that's easiest to hold and struck the victim.

277
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:44,171
How did Mr. Kawase know about this?

278
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:45,371
When the only thing announced in the papers

279
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,871
is that the murder weapon is a rifle.

280
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:52,171
That's because Mr. Kawase is the very person who struck him.

281
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:56,171
His tongue slipped because he is indeed the culprit.

282
00:14:56,171 --> 00:15:00,171
But, didn't Mr. Kawase try to stand up for Sugihito?

283
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:03,971
He's the one that told us that Sugihito's fingerprints were there

284
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,971
because he touched it before, right?

285
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,471
But, back then,

286
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:10,671
he also said that Sugihito was excited, right?

287
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,171
He also said that Mr. Torihira

288
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,971
thought Sugihito was a capable man.

289
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:18,171
I remember him saying that

290
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:21,171
Sugihito was scolded a lot by Mr. Torihira, too.

291
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,771
I see. It looks like he's trying to back him up,

292
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:26,371
but it could be the exact opposite.

293
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:30,471
But Mr. Sugihito Enomoto's fingerprints

294
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,171
were also found on the buttons of this dress shirt...

295
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:34,871
Oh, that's right. Mr. Kawase also said that

296
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:36,871
he stayed over a lot at Sugihito's place,

297
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,171
because his apartment was near the company.

298
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:43,871
I see! If he goes to work the next day after staying over,

299
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,171
he could've borrowed the dress shirt.

300
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:50,371
In other words, he could've kept the dress shirt he borrowed,

301
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:53,671
wore it just before committing the crime, then carried out his thing.

302
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,871
Right. Then, he disposed of it

303
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,471
at a trash dump near the Sugihito's apartment after committing the crime.

304
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,971
Then, why did he flee?

305
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:05,471
Maybe Mr. Kawase told him to.

306
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:07,671
By saying something like, "You touched that rifle, didn't you?

307
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:11,071
If you're arrested now, you'll be caught and made the culprit."

308
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,471
It could be that Azusa was also called out by Mr. Kawase.

309
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:15,671
What?

310
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:18,871
Why does he have to call her out, too?

311
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,471
Oh, well... I just kind of thought so.

312
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,871
The cell phone photo, I think.

313
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:27,871
Remember, Sugihito sent an interesting picture

314
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:30,171
to Azusa last night, right?

315
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:33,171
It seems like he also sent it to the person called Kawase,

316
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:37,171
so I'm sure that man wanted to have it all to himself.

317
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:41,471
How stupid can you get? Why would he want to have

318
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,071
such a silly picture like that all for himself?

319
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,671
Snow?

320
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,971
That picture was of snow.

321
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,471
Officer Chiba, didn't you have a tough time last night

322
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:53,271
because of the snow?

323
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,671
Yeah. Just around the time of the murder between 22:00 and 23:00

324
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:59,471
when I was returning from the Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department,

325
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,771
the freeway was closed and the trains were delayed because of the snow.

326
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,471
Hey, Sugihito's apartment

327
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,671
was near his company in Kanagawa, right?

328
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:11,571
Yes, an hour or so away from here.

329
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:15,571
The murder was committed in a condo in this neighbourhood...

330
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,271
Won't that picture serve as evidence?

331
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:23,071
Because transportation was paralyzed by snow.

332
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:27,071
Yeah, though digital photos are rarely used as evidence.

333
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,071
But, if the culprit thought it could be used,

334
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:32,171
he could've called out Sugihito's younger sister

335
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:35,471
and told her to bring the photo in her cell phone

336
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,571
in order to get rid of the evidence.

337
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,871
But, how did he call her out?

338
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:42,371
What we should suspect is the assorted cookies

339
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:45,471
that came for Sugihito just a while ago.

340
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,071
Is it Azusa's birthday today?

341
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:52,071
I wonder... I don't think so, though. Why?

342
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,871
Because the parcel had a ribbon wrapped around it,

343
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:58,171
so I thought maybe it was a special present.

344
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,271
Well, since all the other parcels that Sugihito sent her

345
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:02,471
didn't have ribbons around them,

346
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:06,671
so that's why Azusa thought, "What kind it be?", right?

347
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:09,371
Hey! Where did she put that ribbon?

348
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:13,071
I'm sure she threw it in the trash basket together with the wrapper.

349
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:21,971
A vacant warehouse 4 in 3rd district, Okuhocho.

350
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,671
Contact the police in this jurisdiction,

351
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,571
-and have them dispatch officers immediately. -Yes, sir.

352
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,171
Are we going to make it in time?

353
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:32,071
No, we most likely won't make it in time,

354
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:33,771
starting off now.

355
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,371
Sugihito, where are you?

356
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:41,271
You're here, aren't you? Sugihito!

357
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,171
Oh, Azusa?

358
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,571
Sugihito.

359
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:48,271
Why'd you come here?

360
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,471
What do you mean why?

361
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,071
You wrote the address of this place

362
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:54,371
on the ribbon of the parcel you sent me and told to come here.

363
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:57,871
That's why I mailed Mr. Kawase, too and called him out here.

364
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,271
So that he could convince you to stop running around

365
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:03,971
and go to the police if you're really innocent.

366
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:07,971
Stop running around? I mean he's the one who told me

367
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:10,171
to run for it and hide here, too.

368
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:13,071
He? Just what do you mean?

369
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,571
Azusa!

370
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,171
This is what it means.

371
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:24,871
I've been waiting for two hours now, Azusa,

372
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,171
for you to come here.

373
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,871
You were waiting here?

374
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:29,971
Yeah.

375
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,671
Because you sent me such a meaningless cell phone picture.

376
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:37,571
Okay then. You brought your cell phone with you like I told you to.

377
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:40,271
Cell phone photo? You mean the one I sent you last night?

378
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:43,871
Yeah, it'll serve as your alibi, despite me

379
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:46,471
going out of my way to set you up as the killer.

380
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,571
Don't tell me that you're the one who killed department head Torihira?

381
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:50,971
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:54,371
I bought the stocks of the company and really lost out

383
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:56,971
and had a debt of 1 billion yen.

384
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:00,071
And old man Torihira found out about it.

385
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:01,871
He told me that he'll make me pay him back

386
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,371
even if I have to do so all my life, so I shut him up.

387
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,671
It was right after that

388
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:10,771
I got that cell phone picture from you.

389
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:15,371
If you didn't send me that cell phone photo,

390
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:18,071
Azusa didn't have to die.

391
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:19,071
Wait!

392
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,671
If you don't want your little sister to die,

393
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:22,671
write a will right here and now.

394
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,371
Later put your neck through the rope.

395
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,171
And you know what to do, right?

396
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,271
Why you!

397
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,371
If you write it well, I'll save your little sister.

398
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:36,871
Fortunately, she hasn't heard my voice

399
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,671
and it seems she also trusted me too,

400
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,871
so write it well, now. Bad mouth Torihira

401
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,571
and write the reason why you decided to stop running.

402
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,571
Write a prize sob story that will bring tears to the dumb police.

403
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,171
No, no!

404
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:54,171
That won't bring tears to our eyes at all.

405
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,771
I mean a silly story like that would dry tears

406
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,771
rather than make them flow.

407
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:02,671
If I were you, I would rewrite the script this way.

408
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:07,571
A tomboy police officer raids the site in the nick of time

409
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:10,171
and succeeds in getting hold of the suspect.

410
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:11,971
I think this story will be more favoured

411
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,471
being it's a happy ending, don't you?

412
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:16,071
Why's a police officer here?

413
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:18,971
Nobody was tailing Azusa!

414
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:21,671
I came here directly from a different route.

415
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:25,371
Don't tell me that ribbon trick was disclosed?

416
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:28,871
It could be, because I was contacted by mail to come here

417
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,071
since the real culprit will be coming here.

418
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:33,171
Well, as to who the person that contacted me is,

419
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:37,171
I will not reveal it since I was told not to tell.

420
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:14,371
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.

421
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:16,571
I was scolded a bit at the police station.

422
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:19,271
After all, I fled from the police officer.

423
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,371
Well, everything turned out fine.

424
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,771
Your brother was found innocent too.

425
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:27,671
Now, you'll be freed by all those officers with threatening looking eyes.

426
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,471
Hey, hey, officers are still around?

427
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:36,371
Oh, the officers come here often these days,

428
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,571
ever since they ate the special pasta dish

429
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:40,671
the other day when they were staking me out,

430
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,571
saying that it's really delicious.

431
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,071
Is something wrong?

432
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:49,971
Oh, no... I'm happy for you.

433
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,271
Boy! It looks so much like the officers room

434
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:54,471
that I don't feel comfortable.

435
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:01,371
"Next Episode"

436
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:06,271
This rapier is genuine.

437
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:14,971
Maybe he got lost because this place is so big.

438
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:16,771
I'll go look for him.

439
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:21,971
Oh, come on. Where are you, Conan?

440
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:23,471
Next Conan,

441
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:27,571
"Malice Hidden In The Masque"

442
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:40,471
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,071
"Stone coffin"

444
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,971
Stone but it's not the Rolling Stones!

445
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,671
Repent Takagi!
