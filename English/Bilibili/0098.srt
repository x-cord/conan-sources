1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,290
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,870
I'm so glad to have met you!

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,960
Today's earthenware
is second to none!

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,990
And the mystery is on
the national treasure level!

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,590
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,540
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,790
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,569
Mori Detective Agency

9
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,359
Eh?! You got a
call from Kikuemon?!

10
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,489
Yep! From the very man himself!

11
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,119
Who's Kikuemon again?

12
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,199
You've never heard of Kikuemon,
the living national treasure?

13
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,039
He's a potter, Ran-neechan.

14
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,549
O-Oh, I thought he was a
kabuki actor or something!

15
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,109
Geez...

16
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:02,529
So, what did someone
so great want with you, Dad?

17
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:06,819
He said he'd give
details when we meet.

18
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:12,189
He wants me to visit him in
West Tama this Sunday with my family.

19
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,939
With your family? I guess
it's not about hiring you, then.

20
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,449
No, there's no telling.

21
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,159
Being with the family
might be a type of camouflage.

22
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,369
Camouflage?

23
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:29,199
To keep others from realizing
I'm investigating a case.

24
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:36,039
He probably wanted to come
here himself, but he is almost 80!

25
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,629
Oh! You're so good at
reading into things, Dad!

26
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,529
Of course I am!

27
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,699
If Kikuemon-san is a living
national treasure of pottery,

28
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,029
I'm a living national
treasure of detectiving!

29
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,699
Yeah, that optimistic personality
is on the national treasure level...

30
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,809
"The Famous Potter Murder Case (Part 1)."

31
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,629
Wow! This color, this shape...
it's a true masterpiece!

32
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,859
Just as I'd expect from the
work of a living national treasure!

33
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,559
Please don't call me a national treasure.

34
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:29,939
I'm a person, not a thing.

35
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,469
Kikuemon (78) (Tsuchiya Mankichi) Ceramic Artist
I'm a person, not a thing.

36
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:34,519
Kikuemon (78) (Tsuchiya Mankichi) Ceramic Artist

37
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,229
Here you are!

38
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,699
Thank you!

39
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,609
Oh, this isn't much, but...

40
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,949
Oh, sponge cake! Wonderful!
I just love it! Thank you!

41
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:54,319
So, what did you need to see me for?

42
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,989
Do you need me to see if
your young wife is having an affair?

43
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,879
No, no. She's my son's wife.

44
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,839
She's been taking care
of things for me for a while.

45
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,609
Sadly, my wife and son both died
in a car accident two years ago.

46
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,059
I'm sorry to hear it...

47
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,109
I've asked you
here for but one reason:

48
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,279
to ask the opinion of the great
detective everyone is talking about!

49
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,699
I've noticed your deductions
as of late have been so full of flaws!

50
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,329
F-Flaws?

51
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,659
That's right! For example,
the case last month--

52
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,789
Now, now! Don't act haughty, Father!

53
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,319
Tsuchiya Masuko (42) Kikuemon's son's wife
Just be honest and say you're a big fan

54
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,209
of the great Mori Kogoro-san!
Tsuchiya Masuko (42) Kikuemon's son's wife

55
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,089
M-Masuko-san!

56
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,809
He's a big fan?!

57
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:48,659
Yes!

58
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,609
He gets so excited whenever
Mori-san solves a case!

59
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,609
In fact, he just put up a big fuss

60
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,819
when I forgot to file an article
from the other day about a case of his!

61
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,699
C-Come, now!

62
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,029
Okay, yeah, it's true!

63
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,229
Oh, he's here!

64
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:07,489
Wow! It's really him!

65
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,029
Who're those two?

66
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:12,449
My pupils. Let me introduce you.

67
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:13,819
Arita Yoshihiko (36) Kikuemon's pupil
This is Arita-kun.

68
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:17,739
His skill has made leaps and bounds,
and his work shows promise.
Arita Yoshihiko (36) Kikuemon's pupil

69
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:18,369
Hi!
Arita Yoshihiko (36) Kikuemon's pupil

70
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,449
Seto Ryuichi (35) Kikuemon's pupil
On the other hand is Seto-kun.

71
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,919
His works have dropped in number,
and he's stuck in a standstill.
Seto Ryuichi (35) Kikuemon's pupil

72
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,819
His works have dropped in number,
and he's stuck in a standstill.

73
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,259
I'm just in a slump, that's all!

74
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,359
That's what you get for
always copying our master!

75
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,219
Aw, shut up!

76
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:34,659
Please, pull yourself
together, Seto-san!

77
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:39,349
You're to be the sixth-generation
Kikuemon, after all!

78
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,359
Sixth-generation?

79
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:45,359
The Kikuemon name has been
passed down from master to pupil.

80
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,069
I'm the fifth.

81
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,359
Anyway, tell us what kind
of pottery Detective Mori chose!

82
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,029
Yeah!

83
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:57,159
Hold your horses!
I still haven't told him!

84
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,409
What are they talking about?

85
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,279
I want you to have one of my works.

86
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,949
I could've brought one to your office,

87
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,339
but I wanted you to choose one for yourself.

88
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:13,949
Well, make your choice.
Any of the ones in this room.

89
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,989
Y-You're sure?

90
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:19,809
They're all masterpieces,
worth millions of yen each!

91
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,819
M-Millions?

92
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,949
Hold on, Dad. This is too generous.
Show some restraint, okay?

93
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,049
Yeah, I know.

94
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,859
In that case...

95
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:36,079
I guess I'll just choose this cup!

96
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,949
Just as I'd expect from a great
detective! You have sharp eyes!

97
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,009
Looks like I win the bet!

98
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,489
Bet?

99
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:55,029
We all bet on
what you would choose.

100
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:59,989
And, just as I expected
you would, you chose that cup,

101
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:03,979
which is hailed the
world over as a masterware!

102
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,859
It was just dumb luck...

103
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,739
Masterware indeed...

104
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:12,279
I never intended to give that away,
but I don't mind in your case!

105
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:14,279
But, Father!

106
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,749
Oh, yes. I'd also like Mori-san to
see the Fusui-maru, my latest work.

107
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,319
Could you bring it from the storeroom?

108
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,269
Y-Yes. Right away.

109
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,339
Oh, come to think of it,
I don't see Otani-kun...

110
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,799
Yes, he's by the kiln.

111
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,239
Perfect!

112
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,819
Mori-san! Won't you come see the kiln?

113
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,379
Oh, sure.

114
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,109
Umm, about how much is that cup worth?

115
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:52,579
Hmm. If it had a price, it'd maybe
go for about 10 million yen?

116
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,949
10 million?!

117
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,159
You're such a joker!
You already knew that!

118
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,159
I shouldn't have made that bet...

119
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,049
It's worth 10 million...

120
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,029
T-That's a thousand 10,000 yen bills...

121
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,809
What a big kiln!

122
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,189
How is it going, Otani-kun?

123
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:26,719
Oh, I should be able to fire it before dinner.

124
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,559
Otani Kaoru (36) Kikuemon's Pupil
Oh, I should be able to fire it before dinner.

125
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,109
Say, what is this pile of broken pieces?

126
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:37,029
The remains of pottery that the
lady of the house demolished.

127
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:40,659
D-Demolished? By that woman?

128
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,499
Yes. Despite how she seems,
she has a very sharp eye.

129
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:49,959
So, our master won't look at anything
that doesn't meet her standards.

130
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,359
After all, she has the eyes that my son,
who was to be my successor,

131
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,069
fell in love with.

132
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,449
That's why I've left
her in charge of deciding

133
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:02,669
who will succeed the
Kikuemon name after I die.

134
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,199
But hasn't she been a bit strict lately?

135
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:12,229
You have it good! She only okayed
two of my wares this month!

136
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:15,359
She hasn't okayed one
of mine in three months...

137
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,199
I guess I'm at my limit now...

138
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:24,239
Any uncertainty in the heart
soon shows up in earthenware.

139
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:29,169
Any pottery made with such
feelings will also be bent out of shape.

140
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:35,799
Calm your mind like the water
of a still lake, and it will naturally--

141
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,359
Hey! Was that her just now?!

142
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,429
It came from the storeroom...

143
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:43,719
I-It couldn't be!

144
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:56,849
The Fusui-maru!

145
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,189
I can't believe this!

146
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:06,449
I-I'm so sorry! It tumbled down
when I went to climb the ladder!

147
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,409
U-Uhh, really, I didn't mean to...

148
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,819
No matter. All that has
shape will someday break.

149
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:18,089
The Fusui-maru has
simply returned to the earth.

150
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,659
You students can take care of this.

151
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:24,909
Masuko-san, you can start
on the nice meal for Mori-san.

152
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:26,069
R-Right.

153
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,849
I'm a tad exhausted.
Please don't wake me until dinner.

154
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:48,239
This must be Otani's
"everything gets broken" curse!

155
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,329
No, it's not!

156
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,709
Umm, do you need any help?

157
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,779
Oh, we'll clean up here.
You can relax in the living room.

158
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,219
I-I see.

159
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:06,889
What's this?

160
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:09,539
A marble?

161
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,069
I haven't had enough to drink!
Keep it coming!

162
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,159
Is she a bad drunk?

163
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,579
Yes, her personality
changes whenever she drinks!

164
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,779
But, is it really okay to
accept something so valuable?

165
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,949
You don't need to act reserved!

166
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,739
He isn't long for this world, anyway!
He can't make much anymore!

167
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,509
Isn't that right, Father?

168
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,239
M-Madam!

169
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,659
Now, now.

170
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,109
It's true, I'm up there in age.

171
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:56,979
I can only make two or
three decent things a year now.

172
00:11:57,109 --> 00:12:02,699
Huh? I seem to recall you
exhibited ten or so items last year...

173
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:06,989
Never mind pottery! Let's hear
about some more of your cases!

174
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:08,949
Yes, good idea!

175
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,909
Then tell us about
the Tsukikage Island case!

176
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,449
I wanna hear about the Kiri Tengu!

177
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:19,629
Then how about the incident that
happened during my class reunion?

178
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:22,449
You just told us that one!

179
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:25,659
And the art museum
one and magician one!

180
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,089
Let's see... That leaves...

181
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:33,469
Those were the only three that
you actually solved while conscious...

182
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,989
Umm, you'll catch
cold if you sleep here...

183
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,949
It's no use. She's not easily
woken once she falls asleep drunk.

184
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,359
Oh well. I guess I'll carry her to her room.

185
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,989
Hey! Hurry back!

186
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,369
Yeah, I know!

187
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,699
After that, the party
continued late into the night.

188
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,779
The seven people in the
stateroom forgot all their worries,

189
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,429
drank up, and made merry.

190
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,349
Little did we know that a horrible
incident we'd never forget

191
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:19,359
would be waiting for
us in a few hours' time...

192
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:34,119
What? It's already 8:00!

193
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,989
I hate to ask, but could
you go wake Masuko-san?

194
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,859
I'd like to have some rice and tea.

195
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:44,979
Yes.

196
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,409
You slept here too, Ran-neechan?

197
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,389
Something wrong with that?

198
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,859
Mori-san! It's morning!
Mori-san!

199
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,359
He's deep asleep...

200
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,449
It's only natural, Master.

201
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:10,909
After all, he is "Sleeping Kogoro"!

202
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,699
Yes, that's a good point!

203
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:18,789
Umm, her futon is empty...

204
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:22,739
That's odd. Where could she
have gone this early in the morning?

205
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:26,749
Maybe she went to buy
some things for breakfast?

206
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,779
Should we give her a call?
She did have a cell phone with her...

207
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,239
Yes, please do.

208
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,759
I can't have anything too
heavy first thing in the morning.

209
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:44,859
That's strange. She's not answering.

210
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,699
W-What was that?!

211
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,609
It sounded like pottery breaking!

212
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,449
Hey, now! Don't tell me someone's
inside the storeroom?!

213
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:10,589
K-Kid!

214
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,065
M-Madam!

215
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:59,505
She hanged herself just now!
She might survive if we get her down!

216
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:00,515
Hurry!

217
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:04,545
I'll get her legs!
Otani, hold her steady!

218
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:05,325
Right!

219
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:06,765
I'll undo the rope!

220
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,885
Hurry!

221
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,455
Lay her down here!

222
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,885
We're too late! She's dead!

223
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,715
Master. Contact the police.

224
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:26,685
Yes.

225
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:39,425
That's strange! Those are missing, yet...

226
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,925
Could this mean...

227
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:49,285
The deceased is Tsuchiya Masuko, age 42.

228
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:53,755
The wife of the son of Kikuemon-san,
the head of this house...

229
00:16:54,085 --> 00:17:02,215
And you were all in the stateroom
when you heard something break?

230
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:07,465
Y-Yes. We had partied
late into the night yesterday.

231
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:11,185
She went to sleep first,
so I carried her to her room.

232
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:15,145
Her futon was empty when
I went to wake her this morning.

233
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:19,045
Just before we went to look
for her, we heard something break,

234
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:21,115
and when we rushed here, we found her...

235
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:26,045
The sound was of the pottery
that's lying in pieces on the floor.

236
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,465
She had probably stood
on it when hanging herself.

237
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,715
It's been trampled on quite a bit...

238
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:36,965
S-Sorry, Inspector. We stepped on it.

239
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:41,425
That little boy said she might
live if we brought her down quickly...

240
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,435
H-Hold on!

241
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,225
What do you think you're doing?

242
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:55,435
And, soundly asleep as always
despite just happening to be present...

243
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:58,215
...is you again, Mori-kun?!

244
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:03,365
P-Please don't shout. I have
a hangover and my head is killing me...

245
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,615
This isn't funny!

246
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,705
Every place you go, there's a
pile of dead bodies! Do you get it?!

247
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,665
I-I'm sorry?

248
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:15,925
Inspector. There are no signs
that anyone climbed onto the beams.

249
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:16,625
That so?

250
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:21,175
That ladder doesn't
reach to the roof beams, either;

251
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:26,095
something must've been tied to
the end of the rope and thrown over.

252
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:31,295
And there seem to be plenty
of things to tie to it here...

253
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,515
But would anyone use
such important works of art?

254
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:40,925
The shelves don't hold just
the master's work, but ours as well.

255
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:44,275
If she had used anything,
it probably would've been ours.

256
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,705
Still, these certainly are immaculate...

257
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,665
We did spring cleaning not too long ago...

258
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:55,665
Which means the last remaining issue...

259
00:18:56,465 --> 00:19:00,965
...is this open cut on her calf.

260
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:04,045
There seems to have
been quite a lot of blood, too.

261
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:07,515
She probably messed up
and fell to the floor the first time.

262
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:12,765
When she did, she cut
her leg on a piece of the pot

263
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,935
but ignored it and tried again.

264
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:20,335
It's not uncommon for a noose
to be so big that the head slips out,

265
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,355
or for a weak knot to come undone.

266
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:26,575
There's blood everywhere
because she probably writhed around.

267
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:31,545
But I'm pretty sure we
only heard one pot break...

268
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:36,215
Then her first attempt must've
been while you were still asleep.

269
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:39,545
If the rope had come untied,
it would've taken too long to fix it.

270
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:43,385
But why would she commit suicide?

271
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:46,005
She didn't seem like the type at all...

272
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,135
Can you think of any reasons?

273
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:52,095
She was drinking so
happily just last night...

274
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,055
The Fusui-maru.

275
00:19:55,385 --> 00:20:01,985
She most likely did this out of
regret for breaking the Fusui-maru.

276
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,445
The poor woman...

277
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,385
Fusui-maru?

278
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:10,365
The master's latest pot, which was
to be put on exhibition soon.

279
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:15,955
She broke it yesterday when
she came to get it from the storeroom.

280
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:21,005
If she had been
deeply troubled by it, then...

281
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:25,215
Then, it's not out of the question?

282
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:31,215
Yes, she had the motive and
circumstances for this to be a suicide.

283
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:32,635
But...

284
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:34,175
Examiner.

285
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,275
Please compare the cut with
the shapes of the broken pieces.

286
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,145
Yes, sir.

287
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:43,545
But the pieces have
been trampled quite a lot,

288
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:46,105
so I can't say if any will match the cut...

289
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:50,005
A match would make
this question go away, but...

290
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:53,175
Suicide! It's clearly a suicide!

291
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:54,535
Hey, now!

292
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,545
Ouch!

293
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:00,335
What's wrong, Conan-kun?!

294
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:02,925
I stepped on a broken piece...

295
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:05,965
What's with you? You aren't
wearing anything on your feet...

296
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:10,805
I can't help it! I rushed here!
That lady's the same way!

297
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:15,765
Come to think of it,
I don't see her footwear anywhere...

298
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,885
But it's strange.

299
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:22,475
If she came barefoot, the bottoms
of her feet should be dirty like mine.

300
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:23,935
Eh?!

301
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,885
Now that you mention it,
the bottoms of her feet aren't dirty!

302
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:35,325
Oh! Then maybe
someone carried her here?

303
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,365
Eh?!

304
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:38,885
Y-You're not saying--

305
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:41,335
She was murdered, then?!

306
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,885
If so, then that places
the suspicion on all of you,

307
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:51,295
as you were in the nearby stateroom
just before the body was found!

308
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:45,425
Could it be?!

309
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:50,925
Yes! This is it!

310
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:54,895
I finally found a trace
that the killer failed to hide!

311
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:59,855
Using this method, you wouldn't
need to be in the room to kill her!

312
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,055
Just what did you find?

313
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:07,405
Evidence that the killer
failed to hide completely!

314
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,595
On the next Conan...

315
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:12,905
The Famous Potter Murder Case (Part 2).
