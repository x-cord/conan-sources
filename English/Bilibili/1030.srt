Now then. I finished my investigative report.

Here in Koneru City...

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.980
Here in Koneru City...

5
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.020
Maybe I'll go for a drink this afternoon.

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.940
What happened? Are you all right?

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.670
While I was waiting for the light to
change, someone suddenly pushed my back.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.920
I was nearly hit by a car.

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800
Did anyone see the culprit?

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.430
Can you think of any reason
someone would want to kill you?

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430
Does anyone have a grudge against you?

12
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.840
I can't think of anything.

13
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.060
No, maybe I did something to
them during my blank year.

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.600
Blank year?

15
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.090
Are you Mori Kogoro-san, the great detective?

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.860
Yes.

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.120
My name is Esaka Ritsuo.

Please find the past that's
been erased from my memory.

21
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.060
Find the past?

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.640
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.380
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810
A whole year lost!

25
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.660
With his life in danger, he
searches for his memories!

26
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.290
Always determining the one truth

27
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.080
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

28
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.910
his name is Detective Conan!

Mori Detective Agency

33
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.460
Mori Detective Agency
What do you mean, you lost
a year's worth of memories?

34
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.670
What do you mean, you lost
a year's worth of memories?

35
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.720
It happened one evening last week.

36
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.340
Before I knew it, I'd lost
consciousness at the station.

37
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.390
Apparently I slipped down
the stairs and hit my head.

38
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.110
When I returned to my workplace...

39
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.860
Esaka, what have you been doing until now?

40
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.920
You disappeared for a whole
year after going out on a job.

41
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.090
A year?

42
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.620
That was when I first learned about it.

43
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.790
I thought I'd left that morning
and returned that evening,

44
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.630
but an entire year had actually passed.

45
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.440
Something must've made him suffer
memory loss while he was out on a job.

46
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.150
And one year later, something
cured him of his amnesia.

47
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.780
But it was too late.

48
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.580
I was fired a long time ago,

49
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.000
and when I returned to my apartment,
someone else was living there.

50
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.410
Like a sad Urashima Taro.

51
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.170
But I can't recall where I was or
what I was doing for a whole year.

52
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.290
So you regained your previous memories and
lost your memory of the past year instead.

53
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.130
Just like in that old movie "Random Harvest".

54
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.440
After thinking about it for a week,
I thought these might lead somewhere.

55
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.940
I examined their usage history.

59
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.570
Maybe you lived in Koneru City.

60
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.910
I thought so, too, so I was walking around
in the hope that I would remember something.

61
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.950
That's when it happened.

62
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.440
Maybe I did something to
incur someone's enmity.

63
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.720
But I still want to know how I lived.

64
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.040
It is eerie not to know.

65
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.600
Koneru City, right? Let's
talk another look around.

66
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.360
Mori-san...

67
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.490
I, Mori Kogoro, shall find the year
that vanished from your memories.

68
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.410
Discovered in the Mountains!
Partially Skeletonized?!

One year is exactly twice as
long as this person was missing for.

70
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.120
Oh, right. This guy
suddenly disappeared, too.

71
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.130
He was found dead in the mountains
of Wakabadai three days ago.

72
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.100
He was partially skeletonized,
but he'd clearly been murdered.

73
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.740
He was partially skeletonized,
but he'd clearly been murdered.
Outside the Metropolitan Area, Wakabadai

74
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.510
Outside the Metropolitan Area, Wakabadai
It didn't take long to identify him as
Kisugi Akira, who'd been missing for six months.

75
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.390
It didn't take long to identify him as
Kisugi Akira, who'd been missing for six months.

76
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.710
Apparently they're having trouble finding
the culprit who killed and buried him.

77
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.190
He was a con artist, and a lot of
people had grudges against him.

78
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.780
Sounds like he was a bad person.

79
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.280
Well, not that he matters.

80
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.290
Koneru Station

81
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.170
I can't remember anything,
no matter what I look at.

82
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:53.050
But if we find someone who knows you, we
can ask them about your blank year, right?

83
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.040
That's true.

84
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.810
If you showed up in this
neighborhood with memory loss,

85
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.560
then maybe you visited that police box.

86
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.790
Is that your police box?

87
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.950
Yes. What about it?

88
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.110
I believe this man visited
you about a year ago.

89
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.150
I don't recognize him.

90
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.960
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

91
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.220
We'll have to search on foot then.

92
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.890
Even though we split up and asked
around, we came up empty-handed.

93
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:43.730
There is a way to figure out what happened during
your blank year besides finding someone who knows.

94
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.520
How?

95
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.290
What was that for?

96
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.160
It's shock treatment.
You remember now, right?

97
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.660
We could try slapping you really hard, too.

98
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.800
He seems like he'd actually do it.

99
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.910
I know I'm the one who asked for
your help, but you've done enough.

100
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.680
Let's go, Mori-san.

101
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.840
You're giving up?

102
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.160
I'm afraid to know after all.

103
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.280
If someone tried to kill me, I
must've done something really awful.

104
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.780
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

105
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.780
It's hard to believe he's
someone who'd make enemies.

106
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.160
That's why we need to find
your past, Esaka-kun.

107
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.440
If someone has a grudge against you because
of a misunderstanding, you need to clear it up.

108
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.920
Maybe it's not a
misunderstanding! I'm scared!

109
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.150
Esaka-kun!
Esaka-san!

110
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.860
It's that patrol officer from earlier.

A burglar?

115
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.250
How brazen of him to disguise
himself as a police officer.

116
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.370
There was no point in asking him
since he was a fake officer.

117
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.730
You're right. All right, let's go.

118
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.590
I-I said forget it!

119
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.550
No!

120
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.270
Yeah, I remember him.

121
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.140
He visited you a year ago?

122
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.450
Apparently he was bewildered
and suffering from memory loss

123
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.150
according to the person who brought him here.

124
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.080
Maybe he was robbed,

125
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.060
but he didn't have any identification
on him or even a phone.

126
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.160
I checked the missing persons reports, too.

127
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.220
But you didn't find him.

128
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.170
After all, more than 80,000
people go missing a year.

129
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.670
What happened to Esaka-san after that?

130
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.630
The person who brought him here, Kinbara
Takuzo-san, said he'd take care of him.

131
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.460
If we can find that person, we'll know
what happened during your blank year.

132
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.430
And probably whoever holds a grudge
against you over a misunderstanding.

133
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.610
I'm afraid of a possible misunderstanding,

134
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.010
but if Kinbara-san took care of
me, then I need to thank him.

135
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.450
This is the place.

136
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.330

137
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:44.950

Yes?

138
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.060
I'm Mori, a detective.

139
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.460
I see. One moment, please.

140
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.090
Taro-kun?

141
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.720
Looks like this guy is Kinbara-san.

142
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.880
But didn't he just call him Taro-kun?

143
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.720
Thank you for waiting.

144
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.230
Taro-kun?

145
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.210
Where have you been this past week?

146
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.230
Taro? My name is Esaka Ritsuo.

147
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.420
Could it be?

148
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.240
Your amnesia's been cured?

149
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:30.620
Since not having a name for you was inconvenient,
they must've temporarily named you Taro-san.

150
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.660
Yeah, Koneru Taro-kun.

151
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.250
That's right.

152
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.890
I'm sorry, but I have no memory at all

153
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.140
of being called that or
you taking care of me.

154
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.150

I see. I understand.

157
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.400
I see. I understand.

Your amnesia's been cured, and instead...

160
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.900
Your amnesia's been cured, and instead...

161
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.090
You lost your memories of the past year.

162
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:11.910
We came because we wanted to know
how Esaka-kun spent that year.

163
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:17.190
So that's how it is. In that case,
let's invite them over, too.

164
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.600
I'm sure they'll come running.

165
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.210
A-Are they angry?

166
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.790
Then there's no mistaking it.

167
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.690
I must've done something
to incur their enmity!

168
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.450
Does everyone here have a
grudge against Esaka-kun?

169
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.080
How dare you suddenly vanish like that.

170
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.880
We've been worried about you this past week.

171
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.630
Worried?

172
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260
But I'm glad you're all right.

173
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.770
And that you remembered who
you are and where you're from.

174
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.400
It's a little sad that you
don't remember us, though.

175
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.400
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.200
Let me reintroduce you. This is Hida
Keisuke-kun, the construction company president.

177
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.820
Let me reintroduce you. This is Hida
Keisuke-kun, the construction company president.

Welcome back, Taro-kun.

179
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.950
Mizutani Toko-san from
the Koneru Credit Union.

180

I'm glad to be able to talk to you again.

182
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.250
Cram school student Chimura Mamoru-kun.

183
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.170

Chimura Mamoru (20)
Cram School Student
It's kind of embarrassing
to be formally reintroduced.

185
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.020
These three from the neighborhood took
pity on you and your memory loss,

186
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.430
so they helped out here and there.

187
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.180
They kept encouraging and supporting you.

188
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.680
You did more than any of us, Kinbara-san.

189
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.150
You looked after him since you consider
yourself the steward of the neighborhood.

190
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.190
All I did was ask my dad for a little favor.

191
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.600
Mamoru-kun's father let you
live in an apartment he owns,

192
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.440
and you worked at Hida-kun's
construction company.

193
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.320
At construction sites all around the city.

194
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.200
So that's why you went all
kinds of places every day.

195
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.960
Toko-san frequently brought
you meals when she cooked.

196
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.960
It's embarrassing. I'm not much of a cook.

197
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.630
So Esaka-san owes these
people a great deal, too.

198
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.140
Sounds like you were living with support

199
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.730
from the goodwill of the kind-hearted
Kinbaras and these three.

200
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.560
Yeah.

201
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.460
Thank you for the past year.

202
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.630
I'm so glad you're doing well.

203
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.110
I don't know how to thank you.

204
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.580
We've learned how you spent the past year,

205
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.010
but one question remains.

206
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.270
This afternoon, Esaka-kun was nearly
killed by someone here in Koneru City.

207
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.400
Did anyone have a grudge against me?

208
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.280
Of course not.

209
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.030
People loved you. You did nothing
to make people hate you.

210
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.370
That's right. You're
overthinking it, Taro-san.

211
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.410
Then it really must be a misunderstanding.

212
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.700
That's inconceivable, too.

213
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.650
You're probably imagining that
someone tried to kill you.

214
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.070
I can only assume that's the case.

215
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.820
But...

216
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.150
Maybe it was just my imagination.

217
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.930
If the people close to you say so, then
maybe nobody has a grudge against you.

218
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.490
Maybe you weren't pushed.

219
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:04.090
Maybe someone just happened to bump into you.

220
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.110
That's right! More importantly,
we need to celebrate.

221
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.610
After all, you're doing well.

222
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.120
And you've recovered from your amnesia.

223
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.540
Do you drink?

224
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.410
I enjoy a bit now and then.

225
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.120
Oh, you enjoy it endlessly.

226
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.680
We don't have to wait for Kinbara-san's wife?

227
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.980
Tae-san's frail. She's
always in and out of bed.

228
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.690
I made someone like that
worry this past week?

229
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.690
If only I'd visited sooner.

230
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.410
Aren't you glad you didn't run away earlier?

231
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.190
You tried to run?

232
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.110
Mori-san!

233
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.870
No, Shi-chan! No!

234
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.620
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.000
Come on.

236
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.550
I don't like dogs.

237
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.380
Especially not barking
dogs like Shishimaru.

238
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.410
A stray bit me on the butt
when I was in kindergarten.

239
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.770
Since then, I've been afraid of dogs.

240
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.020
Shishimaru?

241
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.400
You remembered Amano-san's dog Shishimaru?

242
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.660
You may not like dogs, but one
helped you remember something.

243
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.160
See? Shock therapy is effective.

244
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.530
The memories that had been completely
closed off to me are returning.

245
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.420
Yakitori Izakaya

246
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.530
It's no use.

247
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.940
I thought I'd be able to remember something
besides the dog's name, but I can't.

248
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.690
It's all right. You don't
have to try so hard. Right?

249
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.440
Yeah.

250
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.570
We called your phone a bunch
of times, but no one answered.

251
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.080
I think I lost it when I fell
down the station stairs.

252
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.160
Mister, you lose your phone all
the time when you get drunk.

253
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.850
It's rumbling out there.
It'll probably strike again.

254
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.570
Thunder...

255
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.160
You don't like thunder either?

256
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.990
It's not that.

257
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.840
I felt like I remembered a scene
of particular interest to me.

258
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.770
I wonder what it was. Thunder... dogs...

259
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.990
Dogs have something to do with it, too?

260
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.860
Then that's not a memory, it's a desire.

261
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.750
You wish dogs would be struck by
lightning and burnt to a crisp.

262
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:16.130
How cruel, Mori-san. How could you wish
for dogs to be struck by lightning?

263
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.180
Oh, no. I was just speaking for Esaka-kun.

264
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.180
Not even I'd wish for that.

265
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.280
I'm going to pop home for a minute.

266
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.560
I'm worried if she's remembered
to take her medicine.

267
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.690
Kinbara-san really loves his wife.

268
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.690
I see.

269
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.740
It looks like rain.

270
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.920
There's that, too, so I thought I'd
go get umbrellas for everyone.

271
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.590
He really is a nice person.

272
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.870
That's why he took care of
you when you were at a loss.

273
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.880
Not just Kinbara-san. All of you, too.

274
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.380
I wish I could remember.

275
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.190
You will eventually.

276
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.140
Something will make you remember.

277
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.170
They're right.

278
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.060
I'm sure something will make me remember.

279
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.950
Three days ago, Kisugi
Akira-san was found dead

280
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.790
in the mountains near
Wakabadai outside the city.

281
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.500
in the mountains near
Wakabadai outside the city.
December

282
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.380
December
According to those with
connections at the investigation HQ,

283
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.170
December
they've determined that he was killed and
buried six months earlier on June 10th.

284
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.650
they've determined that he was killed and
buried six months earlier on June 10th.
Con Artist Murdered Six Months Ago

Con Artist Murdered Six Months Ago
Police are currently working
on identifying the culprit.

286
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.180
It didn't bother me until now,

287
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.310
so why am I so interested in it?

Kisugi Akira-san (38) Found Dead

288
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.160
But I feel like they're connected somehow.

289
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.000
Thunder... dogs...

290
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:17.260
Two Days Later

291
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.380
Two Days Later
It's been two days.

292
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.000
It's been two days.

293
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.800
Maybe he's been able to remember something.

294
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.200
Should we try shock therapy
again if he hasn't?

295
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.360
That's one way to do it.

296
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.000
Didn't he say it's up ahead?

297
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.810
Huh?

298
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.810
Inspector!

299
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.440
Mori-san.

300
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.000
You again?

301
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.610
I know someone who lives at this apartment.

302
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.490
What happened?

303
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.490
C-Could it be?

304
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.990
Esaka-san?

305
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.670
Then your acquaintance must be...

306
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.750
The autopsy revealed that he died last
night around 7PM after consuming a poison.

307
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.800
Judging by the circumstances, it
was almost certainly a suicide.

308
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.760
Suicide?

309
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:12.010
Apparently he regretted
some bad choices he made.

310
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.520
So he killed himself?

311
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.940
Really? Was this really a suicide?
