1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,799
A showdown.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,899
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:07,199
The life of a person and a picture disappeared from a locked room.

4
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,299
Could this be the work of that guy who puts on airs, too?

5
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:10,699
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,199
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,199
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,252
Kogoro Mouri?

9
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:02,252
Yes.

10
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:06,552
Why did you call that famous detective here?

11
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,052
Of course.

12
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:10,152
Father, the thief is after it.

13
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:12,852
After it? After what?

14
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:14,252
Naturally,

15
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:17,752
it's my new painting that the world of art has been waiting to see.

16
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:21,352
My painting, which is to follow "Red Lotus", "Gold", and "Pure White",

17
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,552
and "Blue Storm" here.

18
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,252
And in order to get a hold of this,

19
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:32,152
he will fly here and appear from the darkness,

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,652
the so-called magician under the moon, the great and well-known,

21
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,852
Thief Kid.

22
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:38,952
What?

23
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:40,952
The notice arrived this morning.

24
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,352
"Tomorrow at 20:00, under the light of the full moon,

25
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,352
I shall appear to get the 'Blue Storm' painting."

26
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:48,452
This is a warning of theft.

27
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,052
Oh, no. We've got to do something.

28
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,952
Of course, I've already contacted the police.

29
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:58,352
But he's an elusive, kaleidoscopic and unflawed magician.

30
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,452
I don't know if we'll succeed in protecting the painting.

31
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:04,752
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

32
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,552
With all this fuss, what if someone finds out about it?

33
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:10,852
No one will find out.

34
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,452
Forever.

35
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:16,752
Don't tell me that you, Takeyori...

36
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:20,252
Yes, I couldn't think of a better way to work things out.

37
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:21,952
Don't do it, Takeyori.

38
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,452
Stop whatever you're trying to do.

39
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:27,952
Do you have any right to say something like that?

40
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:31,352
This is all happening because of you, father.

41
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:36,852
If you insist, I've got something on my mind, too.

42
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,452
I'm only kidding.

43
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,952
I was just trying to put on a mean act.

44
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:47,552
After all, I'm a world famous artist.

45
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,952
I would never do something like that.

46
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,352
Then, is the notice was a joke as well?

47
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:55,052
No, this was indeed delivered here.

48
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,452
But no need to worry.

49
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,952
Thief Kid always never get to steal whatever he's after

50
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,452
if Detective Mouri is around.

51
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:06,652
See, thanks to the work of the little boy that is with him.

52
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:09,352
I'm sure he'll protect the painting for us this time, too.

53
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:12,552
That boy called Conan Edogawa.

54
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,852
"Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 1)"

55
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,752
How about it, Conan?

56
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,252
This will be your third confrontation with Thief Kid.

57
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:28,852
Do you think you can outdo him?

58
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,452
I wonder?

59
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,052
I can't tell unless I actually confront him, but I don't think I'll lose.

60
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:35,352
It's not my third time either.

61
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:39,852
So you've confronted him more times than is written in the papers?

62
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:42,252
What's the secret to outdoing Thief Kid?

63
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,852
It's not that I always outdid him.

64
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,052
Of course, it's all due

65
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,952
to the daily training sessions taught by me, Kogoro Mouri.

66
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,752
Hey, you're that famous detective!

67
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:52,352
Then he sure is tried and tested!

68
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:54,552
So, famed detective,

69
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,052
what is your prospect of victory?

70
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:58,552
Victory over that greatest thief under the heavens?

71
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:00,952
There's no such thing.

72
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:04,252
I can make him taste bitterness, though.

73
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,552
He'll suffer!

74
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,252
Victory and bitterness?

75
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,852
Well, well.

76
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:11,952
Hey, what did you come here for? To joke around?

77
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:13,452
Inspector Nakamori.

78
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:16,052
This is the place Thief Kid warned he would appear.

79
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:19,352
You go on ahead with Megure and investigate the murder!

80
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,452
I hate to say this, Inspector Nakamori,

81
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:24,452
but I came to this villa

82
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:28,552
because Mr. Oikawa received a warning from Thief Kid.

83
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:31,252
Inspector, are the police fully prepared?

84
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:34,752
Why is Thief Kid, who only goes after jewellery, is now after a painting?

85
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,652
There's a rumour claiming that the notice itself was a hoax.

86
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:37,852
What do you think?

87
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,752
No comment!

88
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:43,652
Press people, let me warn you again to stay away from the site!

89
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:46,052
But the new painting by Mr. Oikawa called "Blue Storm"

90
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:50,152
is scheduled to be aired publicly on TV soon.

91
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:51,152
Isn't that right?

92
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,152
Yeah.

93
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,052
The painting is already completed.

94
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,452
And he's going to sign it on air.

95
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,952
That is if the painting is not stolen by Thief Kid.

96
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:03,852
What? You're talking like it's already been stolen, aren't you?

97
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,052
Not really...

98
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,952
Anyway, Thief Kid warned that he'd appear at 20:00 tonight.

99
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,852
Until then and until the painting is confirmed to be safe,

100
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,952
don't ever go inside!

101
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,252
Do you understand?

102
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,052
I've been waiting for you, Mr. Mouri.

103
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:19,652
I'm Takeyori Oikawa.

104
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,052
Hello.

105
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:22,952
But was it really all right

106
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,952
for me to bring my daughter and this boy along?

107
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,252
Well, if you'd rather not have us here,

108
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,252
Conan and I will wait in the car outside.

109
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:32,452
We have no problem on having you guys here.

110
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:34,752
I trust Detective Mouri.

111
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:36,052
Thank you very much.

112
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:41,052
And besides, this boy here seems to know that thief well.

113
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,152
Let me start by showing you around then.

114
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,252
First, I'll take you to the atelier where the "Blue Storm" is.

115
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:46,752
Come this way please.

116
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,052
Takeyori.

117
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:49,852
Could I have a word with you?

118
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:53,452
I'm sorry. But can it wait till later, father?

119
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,652
Is he your father?

120
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:58,852
Yes, he is my father-in-law,

121
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,852
as well as my teacher, Haruhito Kanbara.

122
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:04,952
Would it sound better if I pronounced his name as "Seijin"?

123
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:07,352
Oh, the famous landscape painter.

124
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:10,352
But ever since he hurt his hand 10 years ago,

125
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:12,452
he hasn't held the paint brush.

126
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,252
Please come this way, here's the room.

127
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,852
It's a nice atelier.

128
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,852
Just as would be expected of Okutama,

129
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,152
there is nothing but mountains outside.

130
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:32,452
There are five members from the Riot Task Force below the window.

131
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,352
It's difficult to break in from here.

132
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:37,752
He can also use a hand glider,

133
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,952
but all the windows seem to be locked.

134
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,152
Could this be the painting in question?

135
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,052
Yes, it's the "Blue Storm".

136
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,952
I'd like to take a quick peek at it.

137
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,352
No, Mr. Mouri.

138
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,752
I don't like people seeing my work before its completion.

139
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:56,352
But all there's left to do is for you to sign it, right?

140
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:59,352
No, I'd like to still do touch ups here and there.

141
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:00,852
I see.

142
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:03,252
But with a plaster bust here,

143
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:05,352
it sort of looks like the art room at school.

144
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,952
I have art class once a week here.

145
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:13,152
Is that a surveillance camera?

146
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,352
Yes. It was put there immediately

147
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:17,552
after we received the warning from Thief Kid.

148
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:21,352
Would you like to take a look at the images in it?

149
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,752
Let's go to the first floor, then.

150
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:30,452
There are two doors and there are two guards watching each door.

151
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,552
Moreover, they all have pinch marks on their cheeks.

152
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,352
I guess that means Inspector Nakamori has already checked them out.

153
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,752
Listen! It's only 30 minutes to 20:00, the time of the warning.

154
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:43,652
All of you, stay fully alert and guard the place!

155
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:46,352
Oh, so this is the image of that...

156
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:49,352
It definitely has a clear view of the painting in question,

157
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,852
but why's there only one camera?

158
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:53,652
I also heard that there was a surveillance camera here,

159
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,752
but I didn't think there would only be one.

160
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,752
I'm sorry if I didn't seem to get the correct message across.

161
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:02,752
Why aren't you letting the guards into the atelier?

162
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,952
I won't allow anyone in there.

163
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:07,752
It's possible they could peek at my painting like Mr. Mouri almost did.

164
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,552
None of my men would do anything like that.

165
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:13,552
Well, having one camera is better than nothing though.

166
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,252
That's right.

167
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,752
Could I have you turn that camera off for a little while?

168
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:19,752
Huh?

169
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:22,352
I want to check my painting, so for just about 10 minutes.

170
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:26,452
But it's less than 30 minutes to the time of the warning.

171
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,552
Please let me borrow this transceiver.

172
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:30,852
I'll contact you as soon as I finish checking it.

173
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:37,152
Roger.

174
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,252
Please go ahead inside.

175
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,652
-Thank you. -Takeyori.

176
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,952
Father.

177
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,552
Could I have a word with you now?

178
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:48,152
I'm going to do a final check on my painting.

179
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,852
I already told you that I have something in mind too, didn't I?

180
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:52,252
I'll be done right away.

181
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,052
So let's talk later.

182
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,352
Would you wait here a while for me?

183
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,252
He's late. He's too late.

184
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,252
What is he doing? It's been more than 10 minutes since he went in.

185
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,552
I've finished checking, Inspector.

186
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,352
You may turn on the surveillance camera.

187
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:10,352
-Okay, turn it on. -Yes, sir.

188
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,952
How is it? Is it working?

189
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:16,452
Yes. Please hurry out of that room.

190
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:17,452
Yes, sir.

191
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,852
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, father.

192
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:28,052
I would like to see the famed painting that Thief Kid is after.

193
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,352
I heard it's a masterpiece of a set of four paintings.

194
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:31,952
A set of four paintings?

195
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:34,152
The first piece is "Red Lotus", a flower.

196
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:36,252
The second one is "Gold", that stands for moon.

197
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,352
The third, "Pure White" stands for a bird.

198
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,852
And the fourth, the one that Thief Kid is after is "Blue Storm"

199
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,752
and it stands for wind.

200
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,252
I see. Flowers, birds, wind and the moon.

201
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:49,652
I see. He's trying to express the beauty of nature with his four paintings.

202
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:52,952
I can sort of understand flower, the moon and the wind.

203
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,852
But how come "Pure White" stands for bird?

204
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,252
It's a crane bird.

205
00:10:56,252 --> 00:11:01,452
It's a painting of a red-crested white crane standing in the snow.

206
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,252
A rich person auctioned his previous three paintings for a high price,

207
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,352
and it seems the same person is waiting for this fourth one, too.

208
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,352
-A blackout! -The breaker!

209
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:11,952
Somebody go check the breaker!

210
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:13,852
I'll go to the atelier upstairs!

211
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:16,552
-Close off all the entrances and exits! -Yes, sir.

212
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,852
Don't tell me it's Thief Kid?

213
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:20,852
There's still more than 10 minutes before the time of the warning.

214
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:23,252
Father, are you all right?

215
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:24,552
What is it? What's up?

216
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,252
Please answer me!

217
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,052
It blacked out and the old man is still in there.

218
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:30,852
How did he get inside the room?

219
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:33,652
He came in when I was leaving the room.

220
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,952
He came in saying that he can't trust the police or the detective,

221
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,152
so he's going to guard the painting himself.

222
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,452
Since he's a stubborn man,

223
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,652
I figured its better that I ask you, Inspector,

224
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:43,652
to persuade him to lock the door and was about to go call you

225
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:45,452
when the lights suddenly went out.

226
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:46,852
And where's the key?

227
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:49,652
I was in a rush to open the door and dropped it some place.

228
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:50,652
Darn it!

229
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,152
Let's break the door down.

230
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:53,552
-One, two... -One, two...

231
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:56,352
What the...

232
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,552
Shoots!

233
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,852
He escaped from the window!

234
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,252
What's the situation outside?

235
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:05,852
Well, a lot of paint brushes and brush stands came falling.

236
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:08,252
There was no one in sight at all.

237
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:10,052
Look! The painting's gone!

238
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:15,752
Right. It disappeared as if it were an illusion.

239
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,352
Father.

240
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,652
Get a hold of yourself.

241
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:19,752
Father!

242
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,152
Together with the old man's dead body

243
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:24,952
covered with blood as bright red as a lotus flower.

244
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,452
Father!

245
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,661
Thief Kid committed murder?

246
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,661
But Thief Kid doesn't kill, does he?

247
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:41,861
I'm not sure.

248
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,961
If Thief Kid did commit murder,

249
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,461
it's going to take a while to report, won't it?

250
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,761
Yes. If worse comes to worst, it may take more than a day.

251
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:50,361
Hey, you over there!

252
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,361
If you're free,

253
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:54,461
would you please go get me a drink from the broadcast van?

254
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,261
Yes, sure.

255
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,461
Got it.

256
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,261
Here he is.

257
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,461
Inspector Megure!

258
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:11,161
I heard that a murder's been committed, but did Thief Kid do it?

259
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,361
Could there have been a problem with the security measures?

260
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,061
No comment. No comment!

261
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:20,461
But is it true that Mr. Oikawa's new painting "Blue Storm" was stolen?

262
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:24,261
Could it be that you're assuming that Thief Kid would never kill?

263
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,661
I said no comment!

264
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,861
Can you comment on the investigation so far?

265
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,561
Please tell us!

266
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,661
Hey, just where do you think you're touching?

267
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,861
A knife and stun gun were used to commit the murder.

268
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,861
There are traces of a stun gun on his neck.

269
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:41,161
He probably realized that Mr. Kanbara was there when he was stealing.

270
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:42,861
He then used the stun gun to pass him out.

271
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,061
And since the culprit feared that his face was seen,

272
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:47,561
he stabbed Mr. Kanbara with the knife and killed him.

273
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,161
And what about the fingerprints?

274
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,661
Nothing was found on the stun gun,

275
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:54,661
but Mr. Oikawa's fingerprints were found on the handle of the knife.

276
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:56,961
Then don't tell me that he...

277
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,061
No.

278
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,761
It would've been impossible for him

279
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:03,961
to find someone the in the dark without any light source

280
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,061
and kill him in such a short time.

281
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:09,261
He said he heard Mr. Kanbara groaning and coincidentally found him.

282
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:13,961
He then carried Mr. Kanbara and seemed to have touched the knife then.

283
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,061
That's the reason why his fingerprints were detected on the knife.

284
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:20,361
The culprit escaped after kicking the paint brush stands out of the window

285
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,361
when I came into the room after breaking the door down.

286
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,061
Which means that the culprit was in the room from before the blackout?

287
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,861
Yeah, he was probably hiding in the attic or something

288
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,061
and as soon as the lights went out,

289
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,661
he probably came out of that air conditioner and snuck in.

290
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:34,761
How did he black the place out?

291
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:35,861
A timer was probably set

292
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:39,561
so that appliances that eat a lot of electricity all turned on at once,

293
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,561
causing the fuse to blow.

294
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:42,961
Maybe if we checked more carefully,

295
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,961
we could've found it beforehand.

296
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:48,761
But Mr. Oikawa received the warning only yesterday morning,

297
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:52,361
and we received the report last night.

298
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:55,161
Which means, the warning was sent out

299
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,061
after everything had been prepared.

300
00:14:57,061 --> 00:15:00,461
And? Did you see the culprit escape from the window?

301
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:02,661
No. In preparation for intruders from outside,

302
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,461
I ordered the lights shining on the window to be subdued.

303
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:06,861
Since it was too bright,

304
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:09,761
it would be like telling the thief where the painting is.

305
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:13,861
The only thing we got is the two paint brush stands

306
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,461
and a huge number of paint brushes that came falling

307
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:17,061
when the culprit escaped from the window.

308
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,761
Okay, Megure. You can take things from here.

309
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:23,261
Look through the images in the surveillance camera

310
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:24,761
and arrest the culprit, will you?

311
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,361
Hey, hey. The one who did it is Thief Kid, isn't it?

312
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,961
You're in charge of this case, aren't you?

313
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,261
This case isn't connected to Thief Kid.

314
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,061
He never takes a person's life.

315
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,361
Inspector Megure.

316
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,661
The video images from the atelier's surveillance camera

317
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:40,161
are ready to be played.

318
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,761
This is an hour before the incident.

319
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,561
This is right after Mr. Oikawa checked his painting.

320
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:49,361
And this is the image right after when the lights are turned back on.

321
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:52,861
I can see that the images are cut off before and after the blackout,

322
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:56,161
but why is there a cut before and after he checked the painting?

323
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:59,461
I asked them to turn the camera off.

324
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,161
If anyone sees the painting before it's completed,

325
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,561
all the feelings I put into it would vanish.

326
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:07,761
I've been doing so from long ago.

327
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,661
According to Inspector Nakamori's story,

328
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:13,261
after you finished checking your painting, Mr. Kanbara came into the room.

329
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:14,461
Yes.

330
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:16,961
He said that he couldn't trust the police or detective

331
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,361
and insisted that he'd guard the painting himself.

332
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,461
Father is a very stubborn person

333
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:23,361
and it didn't seem like I could persuade him,

334
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:26,461
so I thought I'd have Inspector Nakamori convince him.

335
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:29,461
For the sake of my father's safety, I locked the door

336
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:33,161
and went to call Inspector Nakamori when there was a sudden blackout.

337
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,861
Since father didn't answer,

338
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,261
I rushed to open the door,

339
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,161
but I mistakenly dropped the key

340
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:40,861
and couldn't find it right away.

341
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:41,961
I see.

342
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:46,161
So that's why Inspector Nakamori decided to break the door open.

343
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,661
-But isn't it strange? -Huh?

344
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:51,561
Because after you finished checking your painting,

345
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,461
you're talking on the transceiver.

346
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:54,961
Although your voice can't be heard,

347
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:58,261
you asked Inspector Nakamori to turn the surveillance camera back on

348
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,361
since you finished checking your painting, right?

349
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:01,961
Yes.

350
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,561
If Mr. Kanbara came in at that time,

351
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,161
all you had to do was use the transceiver

352
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,461
to ask Inspector Nakamori to come, right?

353
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:11,461
Well, father snatched the transceiver away from me,

354
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,961
saying that he didn't want to be interrupted by anyone.

355
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:15,761
It seems that the transceiver

356
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:19,061
was found in Mr. Kanbara's pocket a while later.

357
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,161
Yeah.

358
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,561
But can't we think of it this way?

359
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,361
When it blacked out, Mr. Kanbara decided to protect the painting

360
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,661
by hiding it at some place.

361
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:31,161
An atelier probably has many shelves where the canvas can be put away.

362
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:32,661
That can't be.

363
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,361
Before I checked the painting,

364
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:37,461
I closed all the doors of the canvas shelves and locked them.

365
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:41,661
If Thief Kid broke in, he would have less places to hide the painting.

366
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,861
And where is that key?

367
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,761
It is with the atelier keys that I lost during the blackout.

368
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,861
It was found later in the corner of the corridor

369
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,361
and is with the forensic officer now.

370
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:56,461
Could someone take advantage of the blackout and snuck into the atelier?

371
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:57,761
It can't be.

372
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:02,061
Just before the blackout, the Riot Task Force who was guarding the room

373
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,861
have checked to see that the two doors were locked.

374
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:07,261
But Thief Kid can open locks easily.

375
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:10,661
The Riot Task Force members were by told Inspector Nakamori,

376
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,661
that in case the lights should go out,

377
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,261
grab the door knob and not let go.

378
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,361
In other words, someone who was hiding in the attic

379
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,661
came down to the atelier when the blackout occured.

380
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:23,561
He killed Mr. Kanbara who was in the room,

381
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,561
took the painting and escaped.

382
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,661
This seems to be immovable fact.

383
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:33,061
But I wonder if it's really the Thief Kid?

384
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,561
It's hard to conclude just yet.

385
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:38,861
After all, there are no cases in which he committed murder in the past.

386
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,261
But something could've got into him this time.

387
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,461
You sure have a cold attitude towards Thief Kid, don't you?

388
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,461
Of course!

389
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,261
The Thief Kid is the enemy of the police!

390
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,761
Officer Sato, do you have any reason for wanting to back Thief Kid up?

391
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,161
So what if I have my reasons?

392
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:59,961
How could you tell whether it was Thief Kid or not by looking at the note?

393
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:03,061
Because of the drawing on the warning note.

394
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:06,461
He always draws a new one for each notice.

395
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:10,861
If someone were to copy one of them from a newspaper or from TV,

396
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:14,061
they would be caught instantly.

397
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,861
However, according to the 2nd section that Inspector Nakamori belongs to,

398
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:18,761
the drawing this time didn't fall into either category

399
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,961
and was exactly like his drawings despite being drawn with new lines,

400
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,561
and they deemed it to be genuine.

401
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:27,561
Then somebody who's a good drawer could be copying Thief Kid.

402
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:31,161
Like a comic drawer or an illustrator.

403
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,061
Or even a painter.

404
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:34,561
Hey, Conan!

405
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,261
I was just stating examples.

406
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:40,061
Well, I can't draw cartoon-like drawings like he does though.

407
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,561
From the view point of a professional painter,

408
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,561
I think that the drawing is genuine.

409
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,161
I think so, too!

410
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:48,561
Thief Kid is to blame.

411
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,661
He's a villain after all!

412
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,361
Please share your wisdom with us to catch the villain then.

413
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,361
My telephone's ringing.

414
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:00,061
This one's ringing.

415
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:02,561
You have two cell phones? Why is that?

416
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:06,661
Yes, I have one for work and one for private use.

417
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:09,161
One of the phones seems to have blood on it.

418
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,461
Right after I carried father who was covered with blood,

419
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,761
I called my relatives to tell them of what happened using this cell phone.

420
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,961
So I guess that's when the blood rubbed off.

421
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:19,261
Yes, it's me.

422
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,561
I'm sort of busy now, so can you call me later?

423
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,761
I'm sorry, but may I go change clothes?

424
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:29,361
I'd like to get out of these clothes with my father's blood smeared on.

425
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,561
Please go through a body check first then.

426
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:36,561
Inspector Nakamori already did a very thorough body check on me.

427
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:01,361
I've come to get the truth.

428
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,061
Thief Kid?

429
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:14,761
"Fragile equipment inside. Do not open."

430
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,561
Hey, come here a second.

431
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,161
Do you have any idea what's in this bag?

432
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:20,761
Just leave it as is!

433
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,861
You'll get yelled at if you touch it without permission.

434
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:23,961
Hey, sonny!

435
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:26,761
May I have a word with you?

436
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:27,861
What is it?

437
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:30,261
I've been wondering from some time ago,

438
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:31,761
but your back pocket...

439
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:32,761
Huh?

440
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,261
There seems to be something inside.

441
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,661
-That's... -What?

442
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:39,261
Look, it's a card!

443
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:40,461
Thief Kid!

444
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,961
You've made a great discovery, sonny!

445
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,961
I'm sure that Thief Kid put them inside

446
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,861
some time before the incident occurred.

447
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,361
Yeah. I've got to tell the Inspector right away!

448
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:51,661
So it was Thief Kid after all!

449
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,361
Is that what you want me to say?

450
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,561
Huh?

451
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,161
Just as I thought.

452
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:02,061
He figured a child would be excited about anything that involved Thief Kid.

453
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:04,661
So that's why he invited me here.

454
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:08,261
But if he got these cards ready,

455
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,861
he would've left them behind at the scene of the murder.

456
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,461
This means it's genuine and he only just found it.

457
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:18,461
Inspector Nakamori who did the body check wouldn't have overlooked this.

458
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:22,961
In other words, the one who put these cards in Mr. Oikawa's clothes

459
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,761
must be someone who came here after the body check was done.

460
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:32,161
I'll rip off your snobbish mask today for sure, Thief Kid!

461
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:35,761
Under the golden light of this full moon.

462
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,761
"Next Episode" -We still can't come to any conclusion,

463
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:09,561
but he's certainly a prime suspect.

464
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:14,761
Well, if Thief Kid was the culprit, he would already have fled somewhere.

465
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:18,061
I've figured out something that might be a hint.

466
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,861
May I try an experiment?

467
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,261
It should be somewhere here.

468
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:25,261
There it is!

469
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:34,361
Next Conan, "Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 2)"

470
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:51,861
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:54,661
"Something that is there even if you think it's not"

472
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,161
I wonder if Kid's really here?

473
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,161
I know that at least one kid is here.

474
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,361
And that kid is me.
