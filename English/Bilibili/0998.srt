00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,310
After all that time you spent,
this is what you made?

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,050
I can't sell this!

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,750
The products I make are the very best.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,880
You can't sell them because
you're incompetent.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,850
Shut up!

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,020
This company got big because
of my management policies.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,900
Excuse me...

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,350
If you hadn't been in charge,
we might've gotten even bigger.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,400
Shut up!

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,860
You kicked it!

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,190
I put a lot of effort into making that!

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,770
You may be the president,
but you'll pay for that!

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,080
I'm already way past my limit with you!

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,830
Please calm down, sir.

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,750
You, too, chief.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,000
Please stop.

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,800

It perfectly draws out the

Let me see.

51
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,321
Ow!

52
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,571
Jeez, Dad.

53
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:03,961
Ran-neechan, these are delicious.

54
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:07,351
Yeah. They're soft, and the
flavors have so much depth.

55
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:08,811
They're amazing.

56
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,481
Thank you.

57
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:14,211
We have lots of delicious hamburger recipes.

58
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,551
I'll give them to you later.

59
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,941
Really?

60
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:23,871
Now it's time for a word from
our company's president, Omura.

61
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,351
Sir?

62
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:28,851
Sir?

63
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,111
The president is...

64
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,551
He's gone.

65
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,961
Please call the police. Quickly.

66
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,311
Mister, the window.

67
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,341
There's no one here.

68
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,671
They must've fled.

69
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,221
Hey, Mister. What's that?

70
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,571
What's what?

71
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:10,861
President Omura died when he was stabbed
in the chest with a knife-like blade

72
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:13,981
by someone who entered through the window.

73
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,991
Since his wallet is missing, it's
possible that this was a robbery.

74
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:23,831
No way! He was killed by a robber?

75
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:25,151
Sir...

76
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:30,161
Tomi-san, hang in there.

77
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,131
Have you ordered an emergency deployment?

78
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,131
We've already secured the neighborhood.

79
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,131
If any suspicious persons are discovered,
we'll be notified immediately.

80
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,141
Are these all the employees
and concerned parties?

81
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:48,141
Yes. This is everyone who
was inside the building.

82
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,451
This building?

83
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:53,021
You mean this isn't everyone?

84
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,071
No.

85
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,561
That's our research building.

86
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,491
There are people working in there, too.

87
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,061
I see.

88
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,571
In that case, could you have them
come here right away as well?

89
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,751
Chief!

90
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:32,191
Watch out. Please don't enter the room.

91
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:41,441
The man on the floor is R&D Chief
Koshiro Masakazu-san. Is that correct?

92
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:45,371
Y-Yes. That's definitely him.

93
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,751
How could this happen?

94
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,451
Why did the chief have to die, too?

95
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:53,581
According to forensics,
a gas tank was leaking.

96
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,461
I-It was an accident?

97
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:57,591
Well, actually...

98
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,711
We found this in the room.

99
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:00,961
A suicide note?

100
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:04,531
Koshiro-san's body was
right next to the sofa.

101
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:08,471
Perhaps he took some sleeping
pills and was sleeping there.

102
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,891
You mean...

103
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,541
It's possible that Koshiro-san
took sleeping pills,

104
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,811
opened the gas valve, and killed himself.

105
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:17,061
Suicide?

106
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:21,581
A spark of some kind must
have ignited the gas.

107
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:30,861
Hey!

108
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:34,401
Don't interfere with the investigation, kid.

109
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:38,541
Huh? Mister, there's something
weird on the floor.

110
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,881
Something weird?

111
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,381
A wallet and a knife?

112
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,511
I see!

113
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:45,841
Inspector.

114
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,641
What is it, Mori-kun?

115
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,891
Ouch...

116
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:54,391
President Omura was killed by a robber,
and Chief Koshiro killed himself.

117
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,181
I can't believe they're both dead.

118
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:59,791
Are you all right?

119
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,291
Hey.

120
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,651
Thank you.

121
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,381
Have you found President Omura's killer?

122
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,161
Have you identified them?

123
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,461
Calm down.

124
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,911
I apologize for asking such a rude question,

125
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:22,591
but did President Omura and Chief
Koshiro have a bad relationship?

126
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:27,751
Yes. Recently they'd been
arguing all the time.

127
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,431
They had a huge blow up yesterday as well.

128
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:33,451
After all that time you spent,
this is what you made?

129
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,181
I can't sell this!

130
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,941
The products I make are the very best.

131
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:42,011
You can't sell them because
you're incompetent.

132
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,211
Shut up!

133
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,631
I thought so.

134
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:51,741
But why did the president and head of
R&D have such a tense relationship?

135
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:58,791
This company was founded ten
years ago as a venture company

136
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:03,251
under President Omura and Chief
Koshiro's joint management.

137
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:08,411
They produced several hit products
and received media attention.

138
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:14,011
I love this company's frying pans and
applied to review their new product.

139
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,851
But recently,

140
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:18,591
a plan was made to list the company on the
First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

141
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,631
Since then, both the president and chief
wanted to take control of the company,

142
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,021
and they fought all the time.

143
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,441
I see.

144
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,531
But is that related to these incidents?

145
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:37,291
We found these in Chief Koshiro's
exploded research lab.

146
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,531
Here.

147
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:41,041
That's the president's wallet.

148
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,921
We also found this.

149
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,851
There's blood on this knife.

150
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,421
We confirmed that it's President Omura's.

151
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:50,931
The president's blood?

152
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:57,681
Yes, which means after Chief Koshiro's
rage reached its peak last night, today...

153
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,351
What do you want, Koshiro?

154
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,441
You bastard! Could it be?

155
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:18,491
The chief killed the president
and made it look like a robbery?

156
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:25,371
Which means Chief Koshiro committed suicide
over the guilt of murdering another person?

157
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,501
Well, actually...

158
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,801
We found these in the president's office.

159
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,721
In the president's office?

160
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:37,851
Yes. According to forensics, this
medicine bottle contains sleeping pills.

161
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:39,501
Sleeping pills?

162
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:43,851
Hold on. Is that other
object a gas tank valve?

163
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:47,831
Yes, which means the following is possible.

164
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:53,311
Before Chief Koshiro came to kill President
Omura, the president visited the research lab

165
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,371
in order to lay a certain trap.

166
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:02,571
First, he put the sleeping pills in
some tea and swapped out the gas valve.

167
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,331
Then he hid the suicide note.

168
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:14,221
There were signs that one of the gas valves
in the research lab had been modified to leak.

169
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:20,221
According to forensics, it may have
exploded 30 minutes after it was modified.

170
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:22,731
Then they killed each other?

171
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:28,731
President Omura was probably trying to kill
Chief Koshiro and make it look like a suicide.

172
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,731
What?

173
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,241
You're lying!

174
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,671
We found evidence on President
Omura's office computer

175
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:39,241
that he composed the suicide note.

176
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:44,521
After modifying the gas valve, the
president returned to his office.

177
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:48,081
However, he was killed
by Chief Koshiro there.

178
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,091
Meanwhile, Chief Koshiro returned
to the research lab, and...

179
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:05,781
You're lying.

180
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:07,971
President... Chief...

181
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,631
I should've stopped them that day.

182
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,611
Then this never would've happened.

183
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,991
That day?

184
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:20,491
But remember what they told us?

185
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,991
Y-Yeah. You're talking about that time.

186
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:26,361
Excuse me, sir.

187
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:29,741
Do you think you and Chief
Koshiro could get along?

188
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,631
Koshiro and I understood each other once,

189
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,631
but not anymore.

190
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,881
All I have for him is hatred.

191
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,261
Hatred?

192
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,211
He's trying to push me out of this company.

193
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:45,671
But when that happens, I'm
dragging him down with me.

194
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:49,651
Then everything will be up to you guys.

195
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,981
I poured everything I had
into designing products.

196
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,381
The president claimed credit for all of them.

197
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,661
I can't forgive him for that.

198
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:08,411
If he's going to keep taking my
achievements from me, then he and I...

199
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,791
You and the president...?

200
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,711
We'll probably destroy ourselves.

201
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,751
When that happens, the company
will be in your hands.

202
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,371
I'm counting on you.

203
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:23,051
I can't believe that
became their final words.

204
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:27,551
We respected both of them from
the bottom of our hearts.

205
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,561
Both as managers and engineers.

206
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:31,601
Indeed.

207
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,391
We joined this company because we
wanted to be like them someday.

208
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,091
We never thought this would happen.

209
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,761
There's a lot behind that frying pan.

210
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:48,081
Yeah, it's sad.

211
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,351
They hated each other and fought over it.

212
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,751
I can't believe it turned out like that.

213
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:58,961
Yeah, even though they were originally
friends who shared the same ambition.

214
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,221
I can't believe they're being
taken away at the same time.

215
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,881
Maybe they were bound together by fate.

216
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:10,501
Huh?

217
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,318
What's this?

218
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,968
Conan-kun, there you are.

219
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,788
Sorry. Hey, Ran-neechan.

220
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:41,068
What do you think this is?

221
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:43,228
I feel like I recognize it.

222
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,808
Recognize it?

223
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:47,478
It's the hamburger sauce.

224
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:50,408
Oh, right. It's today's sauce.

225
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:52,778
It was this color red, wasn't it?

226
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,528
What's it doing here?

227
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:55,798
Let's check out this room next.

228
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:56,878
Wh-What?

229
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:03,748
An alcohol lamp cap...

230
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,248
It's shining.

231
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:13,308
It melted?

232
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:14,578
Could it be?

233
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,998
Conan-kun, is this where you came next?

234
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:20,858
What are you two doing here?

235
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,968
Don't interfere with the investigation.

236
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:24,888
He's right. Let's go.

237
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:28,238
There was something on the wall
of the president's office.

238
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,898
And see how shiny this is?

239
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:34,398
Forensics probably already noticed that.

240
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:38,778
Kogoro-no-ojisan had a question about
that and asked to be notified right away.

241
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,438
Got it.

242
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,798
Sauce... Melting...

243
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:46,788
What is it, Conan-kun?

244
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:52,138
We'll contact you if we learn anything new.

245
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:54,098
Thank you.

246
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:56,528
Come to think of it...

247
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:00,288
Hey, kid. Ran.

248
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:01,758
Is this where you guys have been?

249
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,098
Let's get out of here.

250
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:06,408
Frying pan!

251
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,348
Dad?

252
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:10,568
Hold on, everyone.

253
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:11,898
What is it?

254
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,978
There's something bothering me.

255
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,988
Again, Mori-kun?

256
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:19,188
Hear me out, please.

257
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:24,968
When Koshiro-san stabbed Omura-san,
there must have been a lot of blood.

258
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,748
But there wasn't any blood
on Koshiro-san's clothes.

259
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,298
The chief was wearing the same
clothes I saw him in this morning.

260
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:36,888
He wouldn't have had time to change.

261
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,258
It is strange.

262
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:41,258
There's something else bothering me.

263
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,888
Mori-san, I have the results from forensics.

264
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,888
Detective Takagi, what is the
stain in the president's office?

265
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:51,648
It's apparently hamburger sauce.

266
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,778
When were those hamburgers made?

267
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,668
This morning.

268
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:59,078
But why was there sauce
in the president's office?

269
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,728
It's evidence that someone
snuck in there today.

270
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:03,568
What?

271
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,748
Then there's Koshiro-san's research lab.

272
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:10,658
Inspector, could you take
a look at the AC controls?

273
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,418
It's shining.

274
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,418
It's a melting metal.

275
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:18,448
Melting metal? Could it be?

276
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:22,038
The sauce and the melting metal.

277
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:25,928
These two clues are keys leading
us to the true culprit.

278
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:27,678
The true culprit?

279
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:30,418
First, we can deduce the following scenario.

280
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:35,188
Before the new frying pan
was tested this morning,

281
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,118
the culprit entered the president's office,

282
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:40,968
and stabbed Omura-san with a knife.

283
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:43,928
Then they opened the window,

284
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,858
wrote a suicide note,

285
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:51,538
and left the gas valve and
sleeping pills on his desk

286
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,958
in order to frame Omuro-san
for Koshiro-san's murder.

287
00:17:56,518 --> 00:18:02,318
Then the culprit headed to Koshiro-san's
research lab at the research building.

288
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:06,578
They put him to sleep by making him
drink tea containing sleeping pills.

289
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,598
They set the knife and wallet on the table,

290
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:10,848
put the suicide note in his desk,

291
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:14,348
and swapped out the gas valve
for the one they had modified

292
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:18,408
to make it look like Koshiro-san
had committed suicide.

293
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:22,738
Roughly 30 minutes later,
the explosion occurred.

294
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,378
I see.

295
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:29,518
In this case, it appears as though the two
of them clashed and murdered each other,

296
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:32,748
but it was all engineered by a third party.

297
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,028
Then who's the true culprit?

298
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:39,878
By the way, Taguchi-san, there's
sauce on your right sleeve.

299
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:41,078
What?

300
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:46,758
Your sleeve is at roughly the same height
as the stain in the president's office.

301
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:52,018
That's right. You're the
true culprit, Taguchi-san.

302
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:53,928
What? Me?

303
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:57,938
Yes. While preparing for the product test,

304
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:00,658
you got red sauce on your sleeve.

305
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:05,098
While in the president's office, you
touched the wall with your sleeve.

306
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:09,128
That proves you're responsible.

307
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:14,188
N-No. Hold on. Th-Th-This is...

308
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:17,088
W-Well... B-But...

309
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,328
I didn't go to the research lab!

310
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:23,598
That's right. I have an alibi.

311
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:28,108
When the lab exploded—no, for
more than 30 minutes before that,

312
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,108
I was standing in front of everyone.

313
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:32,928
It wasn't possible for me
to swap out the valves.

314
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:35,308
You did something you shouldn't have.

315
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,858
Something I shouldn't have?

316
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,648
Yes, out of desperation for an alibi.

317
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:45,318
Apparently iron, titanium, and aluminum are
hard metals that don't melt under high heat.

318
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:47,318
What about that?

319
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:51,318
But there is a metal that
melts at 29 degrees.

320
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:54,698
It's called gallium.

321
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,188
He's right.

322
00:19:56,188 --> 00:20:00,708
Forensics said the metal on the
wall controls might be gallium.

323
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:05,758
Normally gallium is a rock-hard metal.

324
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:08,248
However, its melting point
is a mere 29 degrees.

325
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,968
It melts at a very low temperature.

326
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:15,968
The culprit used gallium to fill in the
section of the valve they shaved off.

327
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,628
After swapping out the valve,

328
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:24,438
they set the AC to activate at
over 30 degrees 30 minutes later.

329
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:27,658
If you only intended to make
it look like a suicide,

330
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:30,518
there was no need to cause a gas explosion.

331
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,908
But you were determined to have an alibi

332
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:36,688
so you wouldn't become a suspect.

333
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:40,208
That's why you used the
gallium to delay his death

334
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:43,708
and caused an explosion
to cover the evidence.

335
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:47,458
However, that became evidence
of your guilt instead.

336
00:20:47,698 --> 00:20:48,938
You're making this up.

337
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:51,088
I... I didn't do it!

338
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:56,718
Taguchi-san, there's tears and silver
sweat on the handkerchief I lent you.

339
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,248
This is gallium, isn't it?

340
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:02,728
Even a person's body temperature
is hot enough to melt it.

341
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:04,618
This is...

342
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,608
No. You're wrong!

343
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:08,858
I see.

344
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,128
Taguchi-san touched the AC
controls with those hands.

345
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:13,118
He really was in the research lab.

346
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:14,898
N-No!

347
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,698
Taguchi-san, did you really do it?

348
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:18,448
No!

349
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,958
Detective Takagi, could you please
search Taguchi-san's locker?

350
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,708
I'm sure you'll find a bloody apron in there.

351
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:31,338
Why?

352
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,058
Why would you do this?

353
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:37,918
Both the president and chief
said the company would be ours

354
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:40,598
once they were gone.

355
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:42,118
No.

356
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:43,598
You can't be serious.

357
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:45,248
That's right.

358
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:48,008
If those two clash and go away,

359
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,248
then this company will be mine.

360
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,868
It'll be all mine!

361
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,918
We're having hamburgers again.

362
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:30,888
Yeah, third day in a row.

363
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:32,758
Do something.

364
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,548
Hey, Ran-neechan.

365
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,428
Are we having hamburgers again?

366
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:40,288
Yeah. After all, Tomi-san
gave me a bunch of recipes.

367
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:42,348
Hey!

368
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:45,418
Ow! Hot! Ow! Hot!

369
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:47,858
Wow, not a single scratch.
Ow! Hot! Ow! Hot!

370
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:48,138
Their new frying pan really
lives up to its reputation.
Ow! Hot! Ow! Hot!

371
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,308
Their new frying pan really
lives up to its reputation.

372
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,668
Why can't you guys worry about me?!
