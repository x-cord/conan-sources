1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
"Danny's Restaurant"

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.740
Cut it out, you jerk!

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.340
Let me go!

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.140
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.940
Somebody, call the police!

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.140
Oh, no!

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.640
Are you all right?

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.940
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.340
Hey, you. Are you okay?

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.140
Yes, I guess.

11
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.440
What on earth happened?

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.340
Nothing. It's just a brawl.

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.940
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

14
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940
Love and cases come from the same origin.

15
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.840
A police detective on duty is on the run with handcuffs?

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.140
Wataru Takagi's super long day.

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult

19
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.040
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.519
"Handcuffed Officer Takagi on the Run"

21
00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.519
"After three days"

22
00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.319
It hurts, you idiot!

23
00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.019
I said, don't pull!

24
00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.319
"Ryuta Someya (28)" -Resign yourself, Someya!

25
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.119
I'm taking you to MPD now!

26
00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.819
Please take care of the rest, then.

27
00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.119
Good work.

28
00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.719
How frightening!

29
00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.419
I wonder what'll happen if we fall?

30
00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.319
Hey, do you want to try it?

31
00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.819
What do you think you're doing? Cut it out, Someya!

32
00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.619
There! Fall!

33
00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:21.719
Fall!

34
00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.219
Good work.

35
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.419
Too bad.

36
00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.819
You don't have a gun on you.

37
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.519
I don't get to carry guns around

38
00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.919
when all I have to do is take a suspect of a fight to MPD.

39
00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.719
Oh, no! This is like replaying the "you know what".

40
00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.919
What?

41
00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.719
Oh, well...

42
00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.019
It's nothing.

43
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.519
Get out!

44
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.719
It hurts.

45
00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:26.919
Hey, Officer Kishida.

46
00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.919
Are you all right?

47
00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.219
Yes.

48
00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.919
Let's wait for back up here.

49
00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.719
Call MPD.

50
00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.919
Got you.

51
00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.319
Oh, you got a gun.

52
00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.619
Hey! What are you...

53
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:48.919
Why you?

54
00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.319
Pick up the key and unlock the handcuffs!

55
00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:03.519
Even if you shoot me with this,

56
00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.719
you won't be able to get away!

57
00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.219
Why you...

58
00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:07.619
Okay, have it your way!

59
00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:08.819
No way!

60
00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.619
Officer Takagi!

61
00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.619
What?

62
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.719
Officer Takagi fell into the river with the suspect?

63
00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.719
Officer Takagi?

64
00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.919
Emergency dispatch on the double and request road block!

65
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.919
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

66
00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.019
Darn it!

67
00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.819
Break already!

68
00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.519
Police handcuffs aren't made to break off that easily.

69
00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:00.619
Forget it.

70
00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:02.619
Oh, you can't use it.

71
00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:05.119
I tried it a while ago.

72
00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.619
Darn.

73
00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.219
I quit.

74
00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.919
It hurts...

75
00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.619
Hey, cut it out!

76
00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.919
What's with that non-energetic attitude of yours?

77
00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.419
Get yourself together and try to run with all your might!

78
00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.419
You've got a purpose, don't you?

79
00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:22.719
A purpose?

80
00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.919
You fled because of it, didn't you?

81
00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.619
The town we just came from was the town you were born in.

82
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:31.619
You probably didn't know where to run

83
00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:33.519
so you just happened to land up there

84
00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:35.119
but according to the local police,

85
00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:39.219
it seems you bought a ticket back to the city right away.

86
00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.019
Where were you planning to go?

87
00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:43.219
I had no place to go.

88
00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.719
I just didn't want to get caught yet.

89
00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.119
Cut it out! Look at this! This!

90
00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.719
We're connected, you know.

91
00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.619
Just like the "you know what".

92
00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.819
What do you mean by "you know what"?

93
00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.119
Well...

94
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.119
It sure is of concern.

95
00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:06.819
Yes, it sure is.

96
00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.319
I wish his bad habit doesn't get the best of him.

97
00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.419
Bad habit?

98
00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:12.419
A movie?

99
00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.019
Yes, a movie.

100
00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:16.219
The title is, "On the Run with Handcuffs"

101
00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:17.319
You know it, don't you?

102
00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.519
What're you talking about?

103
00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:21.519
Are you serious? You don't know it?

104
00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.819
It's a masterpiece that has left its name in the history of movies!

105
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.619
A masterpiece!

106
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:30.619
Well, so what about it?

107
00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.319
Two men connected by handcuffs.

108
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.919
At first, they are hostile to each other, but gradually open up.

109
00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.319
And regardless of the difference of their social standing,

110
00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.519
friendship grows.

111
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.819
It's a masterpiece of the soul.

112
00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:47.619
Incidentally, I watched it twelve times on DVD!

113
00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:49.019
That's why, Someya...

114
00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:51.019
If there's anything you're hiding,

115
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.319
since we're connected like this...

116
00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.819
Why don't you tell me about...

117
00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:59.819
Enough, quiet already!

118
00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:03.519
That's the way! That's the way it starts...

119
00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.719
You're doing good, yes!

120
00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:08.319
I told you to be quiet!

121
00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.119
-Let's go! -See...

122
00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.519
So, you've got a purpose after all.

123
00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.819
-Shut up! -It hurts...

124
00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:16.519
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Now for the next news.

125
00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.019
-Today, the whereabouts of a suspect -Dad, Conan!

126
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:22.819
who was being moved to prison along with the investigators

127
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:24.419
who accompanied him became unknown.

128
00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:26.119
They are Ryuta Someya,

129
00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:28.219
who had been arrested on charges of assault and battery, age 28,

130
00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:29.719
and Officer Wataru Takagi

131
00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:32.419
-What the heck is Takagi doing? -of the first investigation division of MPD

132
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.319
-Hey, Conan, this man... -who was escorting him.

133
00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:36.619
-According to the report, the two... -Yeah...

134
00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:39.119
He's the man we saw at the family restaurant.

135
00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.719
It's Sunday. You got to be joking.

136
00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:47.019
I'm sure the police have already come here and investigated.

137
00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:51.219
Yeah, but there's something that's bothering me.

138
00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:56.019
Yeah, the police already came.

139
00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:00.619
I told them that I don't know where that guy, Someya, is though.

140
00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:01.819
Did you still need to know something?

141
00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:04.619
Was that woman a customer?

142
00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:06.019
Woman?

143
00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:10.419
Remember the person, who was over there, when you two were fighting?

144
00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:11.619
"Yasuo Nashimoto (28)"

145
00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:13.619
Yeah...

146
00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.519
I wonder if I should be telling you this?

147
00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:19.119
The fact is, Ms. Konaka...

148
00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:22.219
was being stalked by Someya.

149
00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:24.619
What?

150
00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:25.919
Stalked?

151
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:28.719
So, I tried to stop him.

152
00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:31.519
And I end up like this...

153
00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.719
Did you tell the police about it?

154
00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:34.819
No.

155
00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:39.319
Because she was really freaked out about him.

156
00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:41.519
Do you know where Ms. Konaka's house is?

157
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:45.119
Yeah, I know because she used to discuss her problems with me.

158
00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:47.919
Maybe he's going to...

159
00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:51.319
Yeah, he probably fled because of that too!

160
00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:58.719
You're Ms. Chie Konaka, correct?

161
00:09:58.719 --> 00:10:01.819
"Chie Konaka (23)" -I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.

162
00:10:01.819 --> 00:10:04.019
Detective?

163
00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:07.419
Could you spare me a bit of your time?

164
00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:10.719
I'm sorry, I have a cold and don't feel too well.

165
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:15.219
Isn't it because you're frightened?

166
00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:16.719
Of that man?

167
00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:21.319
He may not look it, but Dad is a famed detective.

168
00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:23.619
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:25.619
Oh, wait!

170
00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:34.119
Dad.

171
00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.619
Thank you for contacting us.

172
00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:39.219
How are things on your side?

173
00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:40.519
Nothing yet.

174
00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:43.019
They haven't been stopped at the roadblock yet either.

175
00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:45.319
I hope Officer Takagi is okay.

176
00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:49.019
Oh... I guess so. Thank you.

177
00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:56.019
It's good news that we've figured out why Someya fled.

178
00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:58.319
If he plans to hurt her,

179
00:10:58.319 --> 00:11:00.719
I'm sure that he'll appear here.

180
00:11:00.719 --> 00:11:04.619
Yeah, that's very likely.

181
00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:05.719
What's this?

182
00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:08.019
Something's not right.

183
00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:09.719
I wonder what it is?

184
00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:18.019
We're gonna cut the chain of the handcuffs

185
00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:19.719
with the wheels of the train?

186
00:11:19.719 --> 00:11:20.819
Are you serious?

187
00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:22.619
Dead serious!

188
00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:26.019
There was a similar scene in that movie too, but...

189
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.719
Are you serious?

190
00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:31.819
Here it comes!

191
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.420
What the heck do you think you're doing?

192
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.720
There was no space where you could get under the train.

193
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.020
-If things went as planned, you would've been smashed. -Cut it out!

194
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.220
It's true!

195
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.520
I'm not lying!

196
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.720
Shut up!

197
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.120
Someya...

198
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.520
This...

199
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.220
Use this...

200
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.620
Someya!

201
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.320
What's that?

202
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.120
The key that the police threw a while ago,

203
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.720
was for my handcuff.

204
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.620
This is the key to your handcuff.

205
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.620
Quit playing around.

206
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.620
Hurry!

207
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.320
If we stay this way, both of us'll fall.

208
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.120
At least you can make it.

209
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.720
Hurry it up!

210
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.420
Darn it!

211
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.720
You're gonna make it too!

212
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.920
Someya... You...

213
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.420
The key... Give me the key...

214
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.020
Yeah... Oh, no...

215
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.420
It's gone...

216
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.820
I must've dropped it...

217
00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.520
What?

218
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.620
Sorry...

219
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.120
What're you apologizing for, you idiot?

220
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.220
I mean, you're a lifesaver.

221
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.520
Thanks.

222
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.420
What's this? A policeman thanking a suspect!

223
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.320
I... I guess so...

224
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.720
But, if you didn't save me, I wouldn't be here.

225
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.720
What a guy... I had no other choice.

226
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.120
After all, we're connected!

227
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.620
Yeah...

228
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.120
Officer Sato!

229
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.520
Eye-witness report!

230
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.620
Where?

231
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.020
Is Officer Takagi okay?

232
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.320
They're at a drive-in on the border.

233
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.120
The local police sent a footage

234
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.520
that was found on their security camera.

235
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.320
What's this?

236
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.320
They look to be on good terms.

237
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.620
So, his bad habit got the better of him.

238
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.220
No, it's nothing.

239
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.620
And? What's the current location of the truck?

240
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.020
Although they already seem to be within the city,

241
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.620
they haven't hit any roadblocks yet.

242
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.120
I guess we have no choice but to just wait here.

243
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.920
Don't you have a girlfriend?

244
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.220
How about you?

245
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.420
Well... I guess I do.

246
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.220
Me too, I guess...

247
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.220
I see... That's why you...

248
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.220
Hey...

249
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.620
Will you let me make a phone call?

250
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.920
Then...

251
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.520
I'll turn myself in.

252
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.520
Rather, I'll go to the police with you.

253
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.920
Really?

254
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.120
Well...

255
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.620
I've got no other choice, do I?

256
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.920
Okay.

257
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.420
I wanna use your restroom!

258
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.020
Go ahead.

259
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.620
Oh, look!

260
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.020
Chie seems to be on the phone with someone.

261
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.620
I wonder if she's talking to Someya?

262
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.720
Oh! She hung up.

263
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.420
I think Someya asked her to come see him after all.

264
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.520
Yeah. After threatening her not to tell the police,

265
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.620
he probably plans to do his thing.

266
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.620
Oh, no.

267
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.120
That is bad!

268
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.420
Officer Chiba! Call the Inspector and ask for backup!

269
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.820
Roger.

270
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.420
Maybe he...

271
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.320
Inspector, Chiba here.

272
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.420
Conan?

273
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.420
"Danny's Restaurant"

274
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.920
Excuse me.

275
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.720
Where's the waiter that was punched by Mr. Someya the other day?

276
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.320
You mean Mr. Nashimoto?

277
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.620
He just got a call a while ago and went to the locker room.

278
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.120
Mr. Nashimoto.

279
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.320
I wonder where he went?

280
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.920
"Nashimoto"

281
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.220
This is...

282
00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.920
So, that's the story, after all...

283
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.920
No good!

284
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.920
Hey, sonny.

285
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.820
If you're looking for Mr. Nashimoto,

286
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.220
it seems he's at the dilapidated factory in Haido-cho.

287
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.420
I found this memo on the table.

288
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.420
Just what do you mean, Someya?

289
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.020
Explain.

290
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.420
Didn't you say you were going to turn yourself in?

291
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.220
I did.

292
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.020
After I settle things with him.

293
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.920
So, explain it, will you...

294
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.120
Darn it.

295
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.620
Just what's going on?

296
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.220
She's mine!

297
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.120
I'm not going to let you have her!

298
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.620
Go for it!

299
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.420
Conan?

300
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.720
What brings you here?

301
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.720
Who the heck is he?

302
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.620
He's the stalker.

303
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.120
Stalker?

304
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.120
Of course, the lady was afraid of him

305
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.320
so Mr. Someya was trying to protect her.

306
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.620
Oh? Someya?

307
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.620
He fled?

308
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.220
This is bad!

309
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.420
I don't think he fled.

310
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.720
Didn't Mr. Someya make two phone calls?

311
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.620
He did make two phone calls.

312
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.320
I see! Then, Someya called that guy

313
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.520
and the woman that was being stalked by him.

314
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120
Right!

315
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.120
Why don't you trust him till the end, Officer Takagi?

316
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.020
Yeah...

317
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.720
I can't wait any longer!

318
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.020
Let's get moving!

319
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.220
Just a little while more.

320
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.620
Another ten minutes...

321
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.020
No, another five minutes will do!

322
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.520
It's about time you wake up, Takagi.

323
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.620
This isn't a movie, you know.

324
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.120
I know but...

325
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.020
Someya!

326
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.820
Look at your face, Officer of MPD.

327
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.820
Oh, no. That's not it.

328
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.320
Well, you know...

329
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.420
I guess I don't have a choice.

330
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.720
There's no way I can flee.

331
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.720
We're connected, you see.

332
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.520
Right, that's it!

333
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.920
That's the way to go!

334
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.120
That the way!

335
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.820
What a jerk, that stalker!

336
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.420
The nerve of him to go as far as to deceive us too!

337
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.920
So, Mr. Someya fled in order to protect Chie.

338
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.820
In spite of being handcuffed.

339
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.420
Well, I guess as to him,

340
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.720
he broke free of the rotten chain

341
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.020
but he himself wasn't rotten.

342
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.820
Yes! He was actually a kind, good person.

343
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.620
His soul wasn't rotten.

344
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.520
Although the rotten chain was severed.

345
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.620
Why are you repeating the same thing over and over?

346
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.520
The rotten chain broke off, but his soul wasn't rotten.

347
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.020
Rotten soul.

348
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.420
Cut off the rotten chain.

349
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.120
Of the handcuffs.

350
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.120
Great pun.

351
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.620
I guess this is all for today.

352
00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:57.020
"Next Episode"

353
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.120
Which means inside the wallet on the desk

354
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.720
was the detailed statement of the bank ATM.

355
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.820
Alibi?

356
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.320
Money was supposed to have been deposited by 2:00 pm.

357
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.420
But when I confirmed it at the bank ATM,

358
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.920
the money wasn't deposited.

359
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.020
What?

360
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.220
Next Conan, "The Three First Discoverers (Part 1)"

361
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.020
Next Conan's Hint:

362
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.120
"Cigarette"

363
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.720
If there are three first discoverers...

364
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.420
We can say that the case is already solved.

365
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.320
I hope so.
