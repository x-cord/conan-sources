00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:21.024
"Riichi Tengan (40) Ventriloquist"

2
00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:22.824
That guy...

3
00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:25.624
That guy order me to...

4
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.924
kill my wife that I love with my very hands!

5
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.624
Why don't you say something?

6
00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:54.324
That's sounds really bad, cut it out, partner!

7
00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.924
You and I, we're one and the same.

8
00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.224
I'm you and you're me.

9
00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:04.724
That means that you told yourself to do it.

10
00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:08.024
Cut out the joke!

11
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.524
I... I can't breathe!

12
00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:11.324
Just what do you think you're doing, partner?

13
00:01:11.324 --> 00:01:12.824
Please stop, partner.

14
00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:16.024
Die...

15
00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:31.624
Now you're all mine.

16
00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.924
So, next...

17
00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:38.724
Who shall I possess?

18
00:01:45.224 --> 00:01:47.024
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

19
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.224
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

20
00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:51.624
The doll as well as partner to a master ventriloquist

21
00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:53.024
moves on its own?

22
00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:54.524
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:56.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:56.524 --> 00:01:58.724
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:49.004
"The Ventriloquist's Illusion (Part 1)"

26
00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.304
"The Terrifying and Bloodcurdling Ventriloquist"

27
00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.204
"Riichi Tengan's Dark Performance"

28
00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:04.004
It was just a doll, but it was really scary,

29
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:05.504
wasn't it Conan?

30
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:09.004
Yes. Ventriloquism is really something, isn't it?

31
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:12.904
Well, I'm doing something really close to it too, though.

32
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.204
By the way,

33
00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:18.904
what did the now popular and still going strong

34
00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:21.404
want you to do for him, Dad?

35
00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:22.604
Beats me.

36
00:04:22.604 --> 00:04:25.804
We can ask him that after his performance ends.

37
00:04:25.804 --> 00:04:28.904
He invited us to come to his live today...

38
00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.404
Just what is going on?

39
00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.704
What is it? Today's live?

40
00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:34.804
Well, master suddenly said

41
00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:36.104
he wanted to change the program for today's show

42
00:04:36.104 --> 00:04:37.704
just before the performance.

43
00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:41.504
Don't tell me he found out about us...

44
00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:44.004
"Togawa Haruomi (28), Tengan's Apprentice" -No way?

45
00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:46.704
He's acting strange lately.

46
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:50.004
"Kazuko Tengan (35), Tengan's wife" -He mumbles to himself.

47
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:52.304
Maybe he's just practicing like usual.

48
00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:56.404
Without his doll?

49
00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:58.704
He scares me.

50
00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:00.904
I'm sure that one day he'll really kill...

51
00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:02.804
No...

52
00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:09.204
Excuse me, is this Mr. Tengan's dressing room?

53
00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:12.104
Oh, you're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

54
00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:25.704
Get out of here! Get out of me!

55
00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:28.904
Stop it!

56
00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:30.804
Please stop it, master!

57
00:05:30.804 --> 00:05:32.104
Dear?

58
00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:33.504
Don't!

59
00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:43.404
You and I are one and the same.

60
00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:46.904
You can never chase me out, partner.

61
00:05:48.904 --> 00:05:52.004
You mean this is not an act but...

62
00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:53.404
Don't tell me...

63
00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:54.704
It's for real?

64
00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:58.004
I'll do what you want me to do.

65
00:05:58.004 --> 00:06:03.304
If you can't do it, I'll do it for you, partner!

66
00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:07.704
No more, I can't take it anymore!

67
00:06:07.704 --> 00:06:09.804
Get a hold of yourself.

68
00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.304
Stop it...

69
00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:17.404
I said! Please get out of me!

70
00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:19.704
No way!

71
00:06:20.304 --> 00:06:22.904
Dissociative identity disorder.

72
00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:25.304
Or is he suffering from multiple personality disorder?

73
00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:29.104
If you insist on not leaving...

74
00:06:30.904 --> 00:06:32.304
I'll do this!

75
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:33.704
-Stop it! -Let go!

76
00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:35.904
Let me go!

77
00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:51.204
Please wait, Mrs. Tengan.

78
00:06:51.204 --> 00:06:53.104
Since he's under sedation right now,

79
00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:56.404
the doctor wants him to spend the night here.

80
00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:58.604
Please stay here near master.

81
00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:00.804
Then, why don't you stay?

82
00:07:00.804 --> 00:07:02.804
I'm fed up already!

83
00:07:02.804 --> 00:07:08.104
Besides, he's got his partner, the doll with him.

84
00:07:08.704 --> 00:07:10.604
I'm sure that's more than enough!

85
00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:22.704
Mr. Tengan got up and is asking to see Mr. Mouri.

86
00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:26.904
I'm so sorry, Mr. Mouri.

87
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:29.604
For behaving so erratically.

88
00:07:29.604 --> 00:07:30.804
I'm embarrassed.

89
00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:36.904
Don't worry. I'm Riichi Tengan.

90
00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:38.504
Myself right now.

91
00:07:38.504 --> 00:07:40.304
He's not around.

92
00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:42.904
Then, you're...

93
00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:45.504
It's true that I'm suffering from dissociative personality disorder.

94
00:07:45.504 --> 00:07:49.204
The so-called multiple personality disorder.

95
00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:52.204
They can't definitely say that I am.

96
00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:55.304
Well, the doctor was pretty ambiguous about it.

97
00:07:55.304 --> 00:07:58.004
The same to you, partner.

98
00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:02.304
You were always shy from before

99
00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:05.004
and couldn't say how you really felt.

100
00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:07.304
Even when you proposed to your wife,

101
00:08:07.304 --> 00:08:09.104
you used my mouth to do so.

102
00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:10.904
Really?

103
00:08:10.904 --> 00:08:13.304
It's really embarrassing but...

104
00:08:13.304 --> 00:08:16.204
If he wasn't around, rather,

105
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.704
if I didn't find ventriloquism,

106
00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:20.404
my life would've been...

107
00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:24.204
In the pits of darkness, right, partner?

108
00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:29.204
And, what did you want Pops Kogoro to do for you?

109
00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:32.904
Oh? Hey, you look pretty smart, son.

110
00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:34.004
What's your name?

111
00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:35.704
Conan Edogawa.

112
00:08:35.704 --> 00:08:37.604
She's Ran.

113
00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:38.904
Oh.

114
00:08:40.004 --> 00:08:42.004
Hi, Mr. Partner.

115
00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:44.404
Same here.

116
00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:51.004
And, what did you want me to do?

117
00:08:51.004 --> 00:08:52.004
The fact is...

118
00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:55.404
Hey. Is it okay to tell him?

119
00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:57.204
Shut up!

120
00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.904
He's doing it himself, isn't he?

121
00:09:00.904 --> 00:09:02.804
I think so.

122
00:09:03.904 --> 00:09:05.504
Hey.

123
00:09:08.304 --> 00:09:09.704
The fact is...

124
00:09:09.704 --> 00:09:12.104
I might kill my wife.

125
00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:14.204
He might drive me to do so.

126
00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:15.904
What?

127
00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:20.504
When I'm home alone, I hear him.

128
00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:22.904
I'm not doing ventriloquism, and yet...

129
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:26.404
Kill. Partner.

130
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:30.404
Kill that woman. Kill your wife.

131
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:31.904
Partner.

132
00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.304
Kill. Partner.

133
00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:36.604
Kill that woman.

134
00:09:36.604 --> 00:09:38.904
Kill your wife, partner.

135
00:09:38.904 --> 00:09:40.204
Stop it!

136
00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.704
Stop it, I said!

137
00:09:41.704 --> 00:09:46.504
Kill her...

138
00:09:47.104 --> 00:09:48.604
It's...

139
00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:50.104
coming from nowhere else.

140
00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.904
But from inside of me, that's where I hear it from.

141
00:09:53.904 --> 00:09:55.904
From him, who's inside of me.

142
00:09:55.904 --> 00:09:58.104
In other words, me myself.

143
00:09:58.104 --> 00:10:00.904
Hey.

144
00:10:00.904 --> 00:10:02.804
It's supposed to be a secret, partner!

145
00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:04.004
Shut up!

146
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.604
How can I shut up?

147
00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.904
That woman, of all things,

148
00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:11.204
is having an affair with your apprentice, you know, partner!

149
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:15.604
He scares me.

150
00:10:15.604 --> 00:10:17.704
I'm sure that one day he'll really kill...

151
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:19.704
No...

152
00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:21.404
I...

153
00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:23.504
If they're both in love,

154
00:10:23.504 --> 00:10:25.504
I don't mind getting a divorce.

155
00:10:25.504 --> 00:10:27.304
Don't lie, partner!

156
00:10:27.304 --> 00:10:29.104
-It's true! -It's a lie!

157
00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:30.704
It's true!

158
00:10:30.704 --> 00:10:32.104
That's why...

159
00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:34.304
that's why I don't want to kill her.

160
00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:36.704
I never want to do something like that.

161
00:10:45.004 --> 00:10:48.704
That was...

162
00:10:48.704 --> 00:10:51.304
I don't know.

163
00:10:51.304 --> 00:10:53.504
I get confused.

164
00:10:53.504 --> 00:10:56.304
I don't know if I'm acting out the doll

165
00:10:56.304 --> 00:11:00.304
or if he who is inside of me appears and talks.

166
00:11:00.304 --> 00:11:01.904
I'm afraid of him...

167
00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:04.304
No, rather, I'm afraid of myself.

168
00:11:04.304 --> 00:11:08.504
When I lose consciousness, I'm afraid of what I might do.

169
00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:10.404
Just like the program of the live.

170
00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:12.304
I might someday kill my wife.

171
00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:15.604
That's why I want you to keep an eye on me, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:11:15.604 --> 00:11:18.804
Please keep an eye on me so I don't kill my wife.

173
00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:22.404
I see,

174
00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:26.104
so that's what you wanted me to do for you.

175
00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:28.604
Please, Mr. Mouri.

176
00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:30.504
I'm sorry but...

177
00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:34.604
Mr. Tengan, I'm a detective.

178
00:11:34.604 --> 00:11:35.904
I think it would be more for your sake

179
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.604
to discuss your situation with a mental specialist.

180
00:11:38.604 --> 00:11:40.204
That's right.

181
00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:42.204
But...

182
00:11:42.204 --> 00:11:44.304
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:50.904
I understand.

184
00:11:50.904 --> 00:11:53.304
Togawa, bring the car around.

185
00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:55.704
But, you're supposed to sleep over here tonight.

186
00:11:55.704 --> 00:11:59.104
He's telling you to bring the car around.

187
00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:02.504
Talk about useless, as always.

188
00:12:05.104 --> 00:12:06.804
I understand.

189
00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:14.304
Mr. Mouri, I'm sorry to have put you through the trouble.

190
00:12:14.304 --> 00:12:15.604
I'm going to change clothes.

191
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.704
See you, dorky detective.

192
00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:18.904
What?

193
00:12:28.504 --> 00:12:31.004
"Mouri Detective Agency"

194
00:12:33.604 --> 00:12:37.804
At least pick up the phone, Dad.

195
00:12:37.804 --> 00:12:39.604
Hello?

196
00:12:39.604 --> 00:12:41.504
Yes. That's right.

197
00:12:41.504 --> 00:12:44.404
Mr. Togawa? Oh, Mr. Tengan's...

198
00:12:44.404 --> 00:12:46.604
Thank you for last night.

199
00:12:46.604 --> 00:12:47.804
What?

200
00:12:47.804 --> 00:12:50.304
Mr. Tengan killed his wife?

201
00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:51.504
What?

202
00:12:53.004 --> 00:12:55.504
Please help, Mr. Mouri.

203
00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:57.004
Please help master.

204
00:12:57.004 --> 00:12:59.204
Please help master!

205
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:25.571
You were sleeping after taking sleeping pills?

206
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:26.971
Yes.

207
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:29.971
I was afraid of becoming someone other than myself.

208
00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:31.671
Lately, it's happening every night.

209
00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:36.071
And this morning your apprentice and manager,

210
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:38.371
Mr. Haruomi Togawa came to pick you up to go to work.

211
00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:40.871
But you didn't know that your wife was dead

212
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:42.871
until he woke you up.

213
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:43.971
That's right.

214
00:13:43.971 --> 00:13:46.671
When you got back from the hospital last night,

215
00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:49.571
your wife wasn't home yet?

216
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:50.871
No.

217
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.071
Lately she's been going out at night a lot.

218
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:57.571
It seems she comes home after I fall asleep.

219
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:02.471
She's out gallivanting at night!

220
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:04.971
What...

221
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:07.971
That's why when that flirtatious lady was fooling around,

222
00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:11.671
my partner was fast asleep snoring in bed.

223
00:14:11.671 --> 00:14:14.571
Understand, dorky officer?

224
00:14:14.571 --> 00:14:16.771
This is...

225
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:18.971
I killed my wife.

226
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:20.371
That guy.

227
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:23.271
That guy inside of me made me do so.

228
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:25.871
I killed my wife.

229
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:28.971
Hey. Here I'm trying to establish an alibi for you

230
00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:30.171
and you got to make that remark?

231
00:14:30.171 --> 00:14:33.471
I mean, don't blame it on somebody else, partner.

232
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.771
I'm just a doll, you know?

233
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:37.571
If murder was committed,

234
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:41.171
you're the one who actually did it.

235
00:14:43.071 --> 00:14:46.271
He looks sort of familiar.

236
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:48.471
Oh... no...

237
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:53.071
Is he really suffering from dissociative personality disorder

238
00:14:53.071 --> 00:14:55.271
and multiple personality disorder?

239
00:14:55.271 --> 00:14:57.371
Maybe he's just faking it

240
00:14:57.371 --> 00:14:59.971
so that he won't be found criminally responsible

241
00:14:59.971 --> 00:15:02.671
and is hoping to be acquitted.

242
00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:05.271
That's also likely.

243
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:10.371
Psychiatric tests aren't 100 percent accurate, either.

244
00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:13.371
What should we do?

245
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.771
Inspector, please let me handle this.

246
00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:21.171
I, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri will, by all means

247
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.671
determine the truth behind this case.

248
00:15:23.671 --> 00:15:26.971
You can put your full trust in me and rest assured.

249
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:32.371
The victim is here.

250
00:15:32.371 --> 00:15:35.671
The murder weapon is here.

251
00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:37.871
And only the fingerprints of Mr. Tengan

252
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.371
were found on the murder weapon, right?

253
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:43.671
Yeah. And from the way the prints were found,

254
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:46.971
he grabbed the trophy that was here like this,

255
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:48.571
flung it up like this

256
00:15:48.571 --> 00:15:50.471
and struck the back of the head of the victim

257
00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:52.971
who sitting on the sofa with her back turned drinking wine!

258
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.071
What's this?

259
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:58.271
I mean, why are you here?

260
00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:02.671
I just thought I'd like to be of help too.

261
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.871
Get on home this minute!

262
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:06.771
Wait, Pops. Look over there!

263
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:08.371
On top of the speaker!

264
00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:17.071
What's this? A speaker?

265
00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:19.771
There's one over there too.

266
00:16:21.171 --> 00:16:23.171
There too.

267
00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:24.971
Moreover, it's wireless.

268
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:26.371
Which means...

269
00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:28.171
There should be a recorder somewhere

270
00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:31.271
that's used to send the sound there, right?

271
00:16:31.971 --> 00:16:33.171
I found it!

272
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:36.571
It has a timer function.

273
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:40.671
-Hey, don't touch it. -Kill. Partner.

274
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:43.971
Kill that woman. Kill your wife.

275
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.871
-This... this is... -Partner.

276
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.071
Pops.

277
00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:50.071
Yeah, let's report this to the Inspector!

278
00:16:53.071 --> 00:16:55.471
Your fingerprints have been detected

279
00:16:55.471 --> 00:16:57.871
from his recorder and speaker.

280
00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:00.671
Will you please explain this, Mr. Togawa?

281
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:03.271
That's mine.

282
00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:06.771
It's been missing from about a week ago, you see.

283
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:08.571
Where was it?

284
00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:12.371
It was found set up in the living room of Mr. Tengan's condo.

285
00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:16.471
It was set with a timer to go off periodically.

286
00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:18.571
Kill. Partner.

287
00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:20.371
Kill that woman.

288
00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:23.771
What's going on?

289
00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:25.371
It was set up?

290
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:27.271
To go off periodically?

291
00:17:27.271 --> 00:17:29.771
Don't tell me this is what the master has been talking about?

292
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:34.071
Mr. Togawa, I think you're taking playing dumb a bit too far.

293
00:17:34.871 --> 00:17:36.171
What do you mean?

294
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:41.071
When we asked you to appear voluntarily,

295
00:17:41.071 --> 00:17:43.971
we checked the contents of your bag

296
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:46.471
and found this under the inner lining.

297
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:48.371
This is mine.

298
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:51.171
This has also been missing for some time.

299
00:17:51.171 --> 00:17:52.771
Why was it in there?

300
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.371
I wonder.

301
00:17:55.371 --> 00:17:57.871
And there's yet another problem.

302
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:01.871
Do you know what it is? The thing that's on here.

303
00:18:01.871 --> 00:18:03.671
A blood stain?

304
00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:09.071
Yes, DNA test results

305
00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:12.571
have confirmed it to be the blood of the victim.

306
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:14.571
It's thought to be the blood that splattered

307
00:18:14.571 --> 00:18:15.971
when the crime was committed.

308
00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:18.271
Blood that splattered...

309
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:21.571
Don't tell me that you think that I killed Mrs. Tengan?

310
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:26.671
Where were you around 2am this morning?

311
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:28.771
About 2am?

312
00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:32.471
I was practicing at home at that time!

313
00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:35.171
Practicing? Ventriloquism?

314
00:18:35.171 --> 00:18:36.771
My master said he'd check my progress

315
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:39.271
first thing in the morning,

316
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:40.971
I practically stayed up all night.

317
00:18:40.971 --> 00:18:42.371
All alone?

318
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.171
Yes! Of course.

319
00:18:44.171 --> 00:18:47.871
This is the spare key for Mr. Tengan's condo

320
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:49.671
that was entrusted to you, is it not?

321
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.271
Oh, yes.

322
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:53.871
Because I need it being that I'm his apprentice

323
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:56.171
-as well as his manager. -Either way,

324
00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:59.371
you don't have an alibi during the time the crime was committed,

325
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:03.971
and besides you were able to freely go in and out of the room.

326
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:06.571
But...

327
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:08.471
By the way, I heard that

328
00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:11.271
you were intimately involved with the victim too,

329
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:12.871
but is that a fact?

330
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.171
Well...

331
00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:17.471
It's true that I had an affair with her.

332
00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:18.971
But, that's because I'm still so immature

333
00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:21.771
and was scolded by master almost every day,

334
00:19:21.771 --> 00:19:24.671
and she was kind to me then...

335
00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:27.571
She was also very lonesome all the time

336
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:29.671
because master was so busy.

337
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:31.271
It was just once.

338
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:32.971
We overstepped our boundaries just once.

339
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:36.271
But, the victim refused to forget the affair.

340
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:40.371
Thinking about your future as a ventriloquist,

341
00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:43.471
wasn't her presence just an obstacle to you?

342
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:45.271
No!

343
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:46.871
That's why you killed her.

344
00:19:46.871 --> 00:19:48.571
You made Mr. Tengan believe that

345
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:50.871
he was suffering from dissociating personality disorder,

346
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:53.971
that is, multiple personality disorder

347
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:57.271
and tried to put the blame on him. Am I right?

348
00:19:57.271 --> 00:19:58.671
Wrong!

349
00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:01.371
I regret what I did with Mrs. Tengan.

350
00:20:01.371 --> 00:20:03.871
I respect master.

351
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.071
I would never do such a thing!

352
00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:07.371
It's true.

353
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:08.771
I...

354
00:20:08.771 --> 00:20:12.471
I didn't do it!

355
00:20:17.771 --> 00:20:18.971
He's pretty obstinate

356
00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:21.271
being that so much evidence is presented before him

357
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:23.671
and yet to deny having done anything.

358
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:26.871
But, I've already requested an arrest warrant.

359
00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:29.271
It's just a matter of time before he confesses.

360
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:32.371
I should be thanking you, Mr. Mouri!

361
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:35.871
I was about to make a mistaken arrest.

362
00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:37.671
You're a life saver!

363
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:41.171
Oh! Is that so...

364
00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:42.471
I helped you out.

365
00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:46.471
Thanks to me. Well...

00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:52.971
"Is the Popular Ventriloquist Innocent?"

368
00:20:52.971 --> 00:20:57.371
I'm sorry for all the commotion I've caused.

369
00:20:58.471 --> 00:21:01.271
I'd like to apologize from the bottom of my heart

370
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:03.671
for all the trouble and worry

371
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:06.671
that I caused to all my fans and staff.

372
00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:10.171
You don't need to apologize, partner!

373
00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:11.971
You're victim of an extramarital affair,

374
00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:15.071
and the bereaved family of the victim who was killed.

375
00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:16.871
But what a surprise that

376
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:21.271
the serious looking Mr. Togawa was the perp.

377
00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:25.171
It just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover.

378
00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:27.771
That goes for his relationship with the victim too.

379
00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:30.671
That did surprise me too.

380
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:32.071
What's this?

381
00:21:32.071 --> 00:21:33.971
What's this that's bothering me?

382
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:36.671
Well, all is well, case closed.

383
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.471
Thanks to the Sleeping Kogoro,

384
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:41.571
also known as the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

385
00:21:41.971 --> 00:21:45.071
Rather, I don't think I fell asleep this time.

386
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:47.071
Why not?

387
00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:50.371
Oh well, I guess there are times like that too.

388
00:21:51.471 --> 00:21:53.071
I'm going out for a drink.

389
00:21:53.071 --> 00:21:54.471
Hey, Dad.

390
00:21:54.471 --> 00:21:57.271
Don't drink too much and come back early, all right?

391
00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:59.771
I know.

392
00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:02.871
You don't know a thing at all.

393
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:05.371
Please help, Mr. Mouri!

394
00:22:05.371 --> 00:22:08.771
Please help the master...

395
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:13.471
Would a person who wanted to frame Mr. Tengan for the crime

396
00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:16.871
call Pops and ask for help in the first place?

397
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:18.671
Besides...

398
00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:53.571
You have no idea?

399
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:55.271
Of course not.

400
00:23:55.271 --> 00:23:59.871
I have absolutely no idea why it was there.

401
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:01.571
I get it, it's this!

402
00:24:01.571 --> 00:24:04.871
This is what was bothering me all this time!

403
00:24:04.871 --> 00:24:07.771
Sorry to have kept you waiting, partner.

404
00:24:07.771 --> 00:24:10.871
Let me toast too.

405
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:14.071
Yes, it's impossible.

406
00:24:14.071 --> 00:24:15.271
Blood!

407
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:17.671
Next Conan,

408
00:24:17.671 --> 00:24:21.471
"The Ventriloquist's Illusion (Part 2)"

409
00:24:21.914 --> 00:24:24.414
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:24.414 --> 00:24:26.514
"Trophy"

411
00:24:26.914 --> 00:24:28.514
Leave ventriloquism up to me!

412
00:24:28.514 --> 00:24:31.314
I can't laugh about it because it sounds so familiar.
