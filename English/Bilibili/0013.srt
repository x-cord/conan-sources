1
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:05,283
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:08,163
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:10,923
If the organization learned that
Shinichi and Conan were the same person,

4
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:12,833
everyone close to me would be in danger!

5
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,133
The only one who knows
the truth is Professor Agasa!

6
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,373
I hide my identity yet again today,
in which there is only one truth!

7
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:56,002
The Bizarre Manhunt Murder.

8
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,922
Robberies, kidnappings, murders...

9
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,792
There's just no end to these crimes...

10
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,872
That's exactly why your detective
skills are proving so useful.

11
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:10,912
Old man Kogoro gets
all the credit, though.

12
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:15,832
All done! These are my special
Criminal Pursuit Glasses.

13
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,622
How do I use these?

14
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:19,332
Try pressing the button on the side.

15
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,512
Sweet!

16
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:29,452
It'll display the location of this
transmitter within a 20-kilometer radius.

17
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:32,462
You can keep it here most of the time.

18
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:33,982
It's like a sticker!

19
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:36,372
Thank you, Professor Agasa!

20
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:40,032
My name is Masami Hirota!

21
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,332
Please! Find my father!

22
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,192
Go on...

23
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:49,912
My father, who works away from home
in Tokyo, quit his taxi driver job,

24
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:53,002
and he's been missing
for a full month now!

25
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,482
So that's why you've come to me?

26
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:56,752
Yes.

27
00:02:56,752 --> 00:03:00,462
I took time off from school in
Yamagata to come look for him here!

28
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:04,102
You're the only one I can
turn to now, Detective!

29
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,352
Very well. I'll take on the case.

30
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,952
This is my father, Kenzo Hirota.

31
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:12,412
He's 5'9" and 48 years old!

32
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,982
What about this cat?

33
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:18,832
It's my father's cat. Its name is Kai.

34
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,402
He has three others
named Tei, Gou, and Ou.

35
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:26,212
Finding people isn't really my thing.

36
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:30,112
But if he had one of these on him,
I could've found him in no time at all.

37
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,822
I know! I'll stick it on Ran
and test it out!

38
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:37,502
Here you are.

39
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,182
What the heck are you doing?!

40
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:43,762
Oh, nothing...

41
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,192
The transmitter!

42
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,332
Oh no! I stuck it there!

43
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:56,832
My mother died when I was little,
so my father is my only family!

44
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,572
If anything were to happen to him!

45
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:11,252
No. Well, not yet...

46
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,792
I haven't found any leads...

47
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,002
Sorry.

48
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:18,042
Masami-san again?

49
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:19,462
That's the third time today.

50
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,582
Apparently he didn't
socialize much with other people,

51
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:26,352
and he almost never talked about himself,
according to his coworkers.

52
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:31,602
Goukai Teiou pulls ahead of the pack
to earn his 5th G-1 victory in a row!

53
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:34,572
Goukai Teiou? (Heroic Emperor)

54
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:38,462
It's my father's cat. Its name is Kai.

55
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:42,922
He has three others
named Tei, Gou, and Ou.

56
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:46,662
Kai, Tei, Gou, and Ou!

57
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,332
Rearrange them and...

58
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,502
This is...

59
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:51,372
Goukai Teiou

60
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,502
...nothing important.

61
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,462
Goukai Teiou truly is invincible!

62
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,212
Yeah, that has to be it!

63
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,162
Hirota-san loves horse races!

64
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:05,082
So he named his cats
after a famous horse!

65
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,502
Hey, Dad!

66
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:07,272
Hey, now!

67
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,252
I bet you can find him
at the race track!

68
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:11,242
Hello?!

69
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:21,122
Wow! This is my first time
at a race track!

70
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:23,442
Let's hurry and find Masami-san's father.

71
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:26,782
Yeah, right! Like he'd
be that easy to find!

72
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:28,592
Don't be mocking us detectives!

73
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,752
There he is!

74
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:36,172
See! I'm such a great detective!

75
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,622
No way!
No way!

76
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,622
I'll go get him!

77
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,582
Wait! He's purposely gone missing.

78
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,712
We don't want to scare him away
and then lose him!

79
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:45,302
But...

80
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:48,222
We'll follow him back home.

81
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:58,622
I've been looking for you for so long!

82
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:02,942
Dad!

83
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,002
Good for her!

84
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:09,112
Doesn't something seem
different about her?

85
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:11,032
She's wearing more grown-up clothes,

86
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,412
and it looks like she has makeup on.

87
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:15,332
She hasn't seen her dad in a long time!

88
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,022
Of course she'd wear make up!

89
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:27,342
That case was as easy as pie
in the hands of Kogoro Mori!

90
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:33,992
Who's that?

91
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,382
He's dead?!

92
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:56,002
We found him after he hanged
himself last night.

93
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,832
What a pain!

94
00:06:57,832 --> 00:07:00,352
What about his daughter?!

95
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:01,122
Daughter?

96
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:04,292
You know, Hirota-san's daughter?
The one who came looking for him?

97
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:08,132
Oh? So there was
something going after all?

98
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,582
Something wasn't right about him.

99
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:12,832
He said he'd pay me a full
years' worth of rent all at once

100
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,072
if I let him have an apartment
with no questions asked.

101
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:18,042
Plus all the bills
were brand new and crisp!

102
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:22,122
My guess is if his daughter did come over,
then she's probably dead too.

103
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,582
What do you mean? I thought
Hirota-san committed suicide...

104
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:28,582
The police said it was a murder.

105
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:33,992
Yes, it was a homicide.

106
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:39,212
He was hung from the ceiling
after he was killed.

107
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:42,372
Judging from the large hand marks
on the victim's neck,

108
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:44,572
the murderer must have
been quite a large man.

109
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,462
What about his daughter?!

110
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,172
These were lying on the floor
near the scene of the crime.

111
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:54,112
These are Masami-san's glasses.

112
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:59,102
Her body hasn't turned up yet,
but I'm pretty sure that she's...

113
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,912
Come on, now. Don't be so depressed.

114
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:05,162
But Masami-san might've been murdered!

115
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:10,222
And she just found her father, too!
How horrible!

116
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:12,872
We still don't know for sure
that she was murdered!

117
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,032
We can't give up yet!

118
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:18,332
But now what? If only
we had a clue to go by!

119
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,002
That's it! I accidentally
put the transmitter on her!

120
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,642
Perfect!

121
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,872
Hey, kid! Where are you going?!

122
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:35,802
The fact that it's moving means
Masami-san might still be alive!

123
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,352
Come on! Make it in time!

124
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:46,622
A pachinko parlor?!
What's Masami-san doing here?

125
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:48,772
Oh no, the battery's dying!

126
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:50,532
I have to find her quick!

127
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,082
Ain't no kids allowed in here!

128
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,182
Get out!

129
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:08,132
The battery's dead.

130
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:12,752
Hey, you! Why were you gone so long?!

131
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,972
Oh, you know...

132
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:16,932
What's up with Ran?

133
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,252
She's been like that for a while now.

134
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,332
She must really be
worried about Masami-san.

135
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,362
Something's weird about that guy.

136
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:26,852
He's been looking
up here this whole time.

137
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,572
He's the man who was hanging out
by Hirota-san's apartment!

138
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,792
Come to think about it,
the killer was a large man!

139
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,052
He killed Masami-san's father?

140
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:43,332
Wait right here! I'll go catch him
and find out where Masami-san is!

141
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,802
Where's Masami-san?
What's happened to her?!

142
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:54,532
Tell me!

143
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:02,822
I caught him!

144
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,022
Good work!

145
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,462
What great luck! Who'd have thought
the killer would come to us?!

146
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,542
Killer?! You've got it all wrong!

147
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,012
Yeah, right! Then who are you?!

148
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,032
I'm the same as you!

149
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:14,912
What?!

150
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:16,952
I'm a detective too!

151
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:23,462
Actually, I, too, was
asked to find Hirota-san.

152
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,662
By this man.

153
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,002
That's that guy!

154
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,502
I'm really a detective, I swear!

155
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:33,042
Then why did you run away?!

156
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,002
That young woman came after me,
so I instinctually...

157
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,752
I've always been sort of a coward...

158
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,412
I wear these sunglasses
so people can't make fun of me.

159
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,382
Enough of your stupid excuses!

160
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:52,722
Get serious!
Masami-san's life is at stake here!

161
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:55,082
Yes, I know.

162
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:59,562
So you were asked to locate
Kenzo Hirota-san as well, then?

163
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:06,212
Yes. But there was something
strange about his family...

164
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,712
This was the man who hired me!

165
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:13,292
He asked me to find his brother
who left Kyushu for Tokyo.

166
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,472
He said his brother
was his only relative.

167
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:18,792
His only relative?

168
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,832
Masami-san was supposed to be
Hirota-san's only relative!

169
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:26,422
That's weird, too! Masami-san's father
came here from Yamagata!

170
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,582
That is strange.

171
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,582
There can't be two Hirota-sans...

172
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:33,372
There's one other thing that's strange.

173
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:36,402
I heard this from the taxi company
that Hirota-san worked at.

174
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,792
Apparently he would drive
the same route every single evening,

175
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,872
without bothering to
pick up any passengers!

176
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:44,842
And he would do this
at breakneck speeds!

177
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,662
He was just letting off steam.

178
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:50,332
Happens all the time to middle-aged men.

179
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:53,332
So, who is this client of yours?

180
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:58,902
Akira Hirota. 28 years old. He's a
large man, over 6 feet 3 inches tall.

181
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,592
A large man?!

182
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:02,252
That's right.

183
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:05,332
Could he be the large man
the inspector was talking about?

184
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:08,752
Tell me! Did you tell this man
anything about Hirota-san?!

185
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:10,582
Yes, of course...

186
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:14,502
And then it was after that
that Hirota-san was murdered.

187
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,402
So I wondered if there
was any connection...

188
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,832
That's it! This man murdered Hirota-san!

189
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:22,382
And then he took Masami-san with him!

190
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,752
Well? How can I contact him?!

191
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,542
He contacts me!

192
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,422
So you don't have any clues?

193
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:30,322
Sorry...

194
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,042
It's him!

195
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:37,492
There's no mistake! It's the man
I ran into at the pachinko parlor.

196
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:43,462
But why did the transmitter on
Masami-san's watch lead me there?!

197
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:49,402
If he really is the killer,
and he was wearing Masami-san's watch...

198
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,702
...then she's already...

199
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,192
...been murdered!

200
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:05,535
Hurry and recharge it, Professor!

201
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:09,625
Stop rushing me! Being impatient
isn't going to help you any!

202
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,015
But if we don't hurry...

203
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,665
Say, do you remember the
robbery from the other day,

204
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:16,535
the one where they stole a billion yen?

205
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:17,955
Yeah, the one with the trio of thieves?

206
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:23,245
A security guard was killed
when he recklessly tried to stop them.

207
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,155
That's what he got
for taking them lightly.

208
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:28,335
Calm, cool, and collected...

209
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,635
That's your style, isn't it?

210
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,215
I get it.

211
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:45,875
Is he really in this hotel?

212
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,145
Definitely! I saw him go in
on my way home from school!

213
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:52,875
That's strange! The transmitter
hasn't moved at all for a while now!

214
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,085
He didn't take the watch off
and escape, did he?!

215
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,995
Yes, he's staying in Room 802.

216
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,905
Come on, hurry up!

217
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,675
Who'd have thought he was really here?

218
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:19,415
Just when I'm in a hurry, too!

219
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:20,665
Thank you!

220
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,555
Open up! I know you're in there!

221
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:32,175
It's open!

222
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,335
He's dead!

223
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,785
This sweet smell...
it's potassium cyanide!

224
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:54,645
I see. He couldn't live with
what he had done so he killed himself!

225
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,085
We should contact the police!

226
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:01,665
That's Masami-san's watch.

227
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,615
So he did take it from her.

228
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,425
Empty duralumin cases.

229
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,455
Wait!

230
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:16,665
Two separate, yet conflicting
requests to find the same person...

231
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,625
Kenzo Hirota-san acting strange
and driving the same route everyday...

232
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,285
And then these cases...

233
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,375
What if...

234
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,845
Huh? Hirota-san was single?!

235
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,205
Yeah. He didn't have any daughters.

236
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:31,285
Plus he was born and raised in Tokyo.

237
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,255
That can't be!

238
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:36,225
That's it! I have this case figured out!

239
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:40,165
These empty cases are the key
to unlocking this mystery!

240
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:44,035
Masami-san, Kenzo Hirota,
and Akira Hirota...

241
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,995
Now that we know they're not relatives,

242
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,495
they have no connection whatsoever!

243
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:51,205
But in the context of
the other recent incident,

244
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:53,105
the entire mystery comes unraveled!

245
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:57,045
They're the three thieves
who stole the one billion in yen!

246
00:15:58,085 --> 00:15:59,705
Judging from the number of cases here,

247
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,875
they must have been filled
with the stolen money.

248
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:06,085
If so, then the reason Hirota-san
sped down the same route every day

249
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:08,785
was to rehearse their getaway!

250
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:13,205
Their plan succeeded, but he took
all the money for himself and ran.

251
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,525
He betrayed them.

252
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,875
Eager to catch Hirota-san,
the two partners concocted lies

253
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,965
and sent separate detectives
to locate him.

254
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:24,415
And then when he was found,
he was killed.

255
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:29,605
Killed by the large man,
who was then killed in this very room.

256
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,045
Killed by the woman who claimed
she was Hirota-san's daughter.

257
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:40,225
Perhaps she was the mastermind
behind these murders!

258
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,685
Wait!

259
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,205
Her hairstyle and overall
appearance were different,

260
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,085
but her build and the number
of suitcases she had weren't!

261
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,205
Where are you going, Conan-kun?!

262
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,835
I found Masami-san!

263
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,045
Ran! Hurry!

264
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,515
Hey, kid! No cutting in line!

265
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:10,585
Our dad's gonna be chopped into pieces
and buried alive in the mountains

266
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:11,955
if we don't hurry and save him!

267
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,925
G-Go right ahead...

268
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,125
Follow that taxi!

269
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,395
What about the mountains?

270
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,835
The reason she seemed different
the second time we saw her

271
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,125
was because when we found Hirota-san,

272
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,375
she was in a hurry and hadn't
completed her disguise!

273
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,835
And then Hirota-san's reaction
when he saw her...

274
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,415
That wasn't because he was
surprised to see his daughter.

275
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,375
It was because he was terrified
of the partners he betrayed

276
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,815
coming to exact revenge on him!

277
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:43,455
Damn it! Why didn't
I realize it sooner?!

278
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,925
What now? We lost her!

279
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:52,245
I'm 100% certain she
entered this harbor!

280
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,935
She's definitely somewhere nearby!

281
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,505
Conan-kun!

282
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,415
Where's the money, Masami Hirota?

283
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:09,005
Or should I say, Akemi Miyano-kun.

284
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:11,285
Okita-san! What's going on?!

285
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:14,995
The sleeping drug you gave me
to put him to sleep...

286
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:18,035
The instant he drank it, he fell
to the ground and stopped moving!

287
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:18,955
Explain!

288
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:23,995
What he had in brute strength
he lacked in intelligence.

289
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:26,965
There's no doubt that he
would alert the authorities

290
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,925
by throwing all his money
around the instant he got it.

291
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,955
As long as someone that
dangerous remained alive,

292
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:34,865
my own plans would be hindered.

293
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:38,335
You intended to kill everyone
from the start, didn't you?!

294
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,985
Now hand over the money.

295
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:51,455
It isn't here! It's being
held at a certain location.

296
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:56,915
I'm sick of you using me!

297
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,665
I'm through with this!

298
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,865
Do you honestly think that is an option?

299
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:01,785
I do.

300
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:05,235
After I escape overseas,
I'll let you know where the money is.

301
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:10,955
We can't have that, now. As long as
you're alive, my plan is in jeopardy.

302
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:15,175
Once you're dead, all links
to me will have vanished.

303
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:20,335
I can easily find any number of
replacements for you and the other two.

304
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,625
Getting my own hands dirty
goes against my principles,

305
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,115
but it will be the finishing touch.

306
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,335
How simple-minded.

307
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:30,555
Kill me and you'll never
know where the money is.

308
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,795
I have a pretty good idea
where to find it.

309
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:39,895
You did a good job. Allow me to
express my gratitude by killing you.

310
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:40,935
Masami-san!

311
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:47,105
Take this!

312
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:55,285
Are you alright?

313
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:57,995
Just a scratch.

314
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:01,415
You're the boy from
the detective agency!

315
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,995
How did you know I was here?!

316
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,045
My transmitter!

317
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:04,895
Transmitter?

318
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:10,955
When we first met at the agency,
I accidentally stuck it on your watch.

319
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:14,995
After following the signal, I arrived
at the hotel and then ran into you.

320
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,785
Seeing you with all the large suitcases,

321
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:20,845
I realized you were leaving
with the billion yen that you stole.

322
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,305
Who are you?

323
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,275
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

324
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:30,455
I had no idea there was
anything on the watch.

325
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:33,725
But the watch belonged
to that big man, right?

326
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:40,455
No, he broke his own watch when he
lost control and killed Hirota-san,

327
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:41,695
so I gave him mine.

328
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:46,135
This guy intended to kill everyone
from the very start, didn't he?

329
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:47,745
Yes.

330
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,285
Hirota-san realized this,

331
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:51,835
so he betrayed us before
we knew what was happening.

332
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,805
Does that mean this man is the mastermind
behind the billion-yen robbery?

333
00:20:56,205 --> 00:21:01,125
That's right. Okita scouted for
people he needed to realize his plan.

334
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:08,705
He would put these people into teams
and have them commit robberies.

335
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:12,335
Rumor had it that he would eliminate
his recruits to keep them silent

336
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,995
after they would finish his jobs,

337
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:15,765
but I didn't know it was the truth!

338
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,205
You're not going to run away?

339
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,995
I'm tired.

340
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:29,175
I'll tell you where the suitcases
with the one billion yen are!

341
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,285
The front desk of the hotel, right?

342
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,475
How did you know that?!

343
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:37,415
When you got in the taxi,
you didn't have the suitcases with you.

344
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,285
I simply assumed that...

345
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,165
You're really something.

346
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,625
That's enough!

347
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:44,955

00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,285
Masami-san!

00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,505
Who's he?!

00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:06,715
The boss behind
the billion yen robbery!

00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,175

was being kept at the hotel.

00:22:17,195 --> 00:22:20,165

Thus the billion-yen
robbery case came to a close.

00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:33,105
Thank you, little detective.
