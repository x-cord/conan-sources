1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,740
"Beika Aquarium"

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,540
The dolphins were cute, weren't they?

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,640
They were really leaping, weren't they?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,440
Super powerful, weren't they?

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,040
But, Dr. Agasa sure is late.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,140
I wonder how far he went to park the car?

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,140
He probably went to Yakisobuns!

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,440
There's a hamburger shop called Yakisobuns

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,840
near the parking lot you see.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,240
I'm sure he was lured by the smell and went to eat it.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,240
Because somebody keeps bugging him to go on a diet.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,640
So, Dr. Agasa doesn't get to eat lunch or dinner then.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,440
Yakisobuns, sounds good!

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,340
I want to eat some too!

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,740
Same here!

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,640
Don't worry.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,040
They have parfaits with bananas shaped like dolphins,

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,140
scallop pastas served on sea otter plates,

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,040
and a lot of other cute, delicious dishes here at this cafe too.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,940
You sure know a lot about this place.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,040
Why do you know so much?

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Well, because...

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,740
I smelled it.

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,740
You suddenly ended up coming here today didn't you, Ran?

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,740
Did you come here before?

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,140
I got it!

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,840
You came here on a date with your boyfriend.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,940
It's nothing like that.

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,740
I just came here with him.

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,540
-She's blushing. -I said, that's not it.

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,640
If you came here with her before

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,940
you should've gone to another aquarium, no?

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,640
When I came here before,

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,240
so many things went on that I didn't get to see the place like I wanted to.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,840
Who are you texting anyway?

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,040
Who else but the fatso?

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,340
"Incoming text message. Ai Haibara"

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,040
Text mail?

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
Just how long are you going to keep on eating?

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,640
She knows.

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,140
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,740
An underwater corridor that is like the bottom of the sea.

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
The shark witnesses the incident.

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,440
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,170
"Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 1)"

49
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,470
Amazing!

50
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,370
There are so many kinds of fishes!

51
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,970
It's like we're in the ocean?

52
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,570
It's a shark, shark!

53
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,970
Awesome!

54
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,470
How big!

55
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,970
They're just like sharks,

56
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,770
that's what a detective is.

57
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,270
How nostalgic.

58
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,770
That Holmes freak and self-loving super snob.

59
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,170
Not even a year has passed since then

60
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,970
but it seems like such a long time ago.

61
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,870
I wonder if back then...

62
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,070
he already liked me.

63
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.

64
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,470
Dr. Agasa!

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,170
You're more than late!

66
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,570
The dolphin show's finished.

67
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,870
You got green dried seaweed between your teeth!

68
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,570
You were at Yakisobuns after all.

69
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,670
Come to think of it, I waited here back then too.

70
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,670
In front of this shark.

71
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,870
You're late.

72
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,870
How rude to tell me to come and be late.

73
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,270
Sorry... really sorry.

74
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,870
A lot of things came up, you see!

75
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,870
Rather, why didn't you wait for me by the entrance?

76
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,670
I had to look all over for you.

77
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,770
I had this great urge to come see the shark, you see.

78
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,270
"Mom. About dinner." "Sonoko. I'm getting better. Thank you."

79
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,070
It's text mail from Sonoko.

80
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,370
She seems to have recovered quite a bit from her cold.

81
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,370
I see.

82
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,570
Okay then, let's get on with it, shall we?

83
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,470
Preliminary check of the what-you-ma-call plan?

84
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,570
It's not a what-you-ma-call plan!

85
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,670
It's the great coincidental two lovers meet again

86
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,970
at the aquarium project!

87
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,470
First, I invite Dad to come to this aquarium with me.

88
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,870
He meets Mom in this fantasy filled space

89
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,870
where the fish are swimming about!

90
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,170
They recall the time when they fell in love

91
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,870
and living apart with each other ends!

92
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,370
You're the one who brought this plan up to begin with, right, Shinichi?

93
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,970
You suggested that the aquarium would be a good place

94
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,070
because Dad likes fish!

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,270
Yeah, but Sonoko's the one who thought up the name of this plan.

96
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,470
But, if it was just to check this place out beforehand,

97
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,470
you could've come by yourself, right, Ran?

98
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,470
Well, but I never came to an aquarium

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,470
and I was too anxious to come here all by myself!

100
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,870
I know too, that you didn't want to come

101
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,470
to such a lovey-dovey date spot for lovers like this

102
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,470
with somebody like me.

103
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,770
But, I couldn't help it because Sonoko caught a cold

104
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,370
and I couldn't think of anybody else to ask, but you...

105
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,470
I'm not saying I didn't want to come.

106
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,570
Then come with me to the cafe here, okay!

107
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,870
They seem to have a lot of cute menu here.

108
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,570
Please help me out with my parents by making suggestions, okay!

109
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,670
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,470
My parents are just an excuse.

111
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,770
Maybe it's not such a great idea to meet in front of the sharks.

112
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,670
They don't give off good images.

113
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,570
The real truth is I want to come here with Shinichi.

114
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,770
Shinichi...

115
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,670
What do you think?

116
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,870
Think what?

117
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,570
My clothes, clothes!

118
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,570
I kind of really like this dress you see.

119
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,970
I guess it's nice?

120
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,470
Is that all?

121
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,270
If you want somebody to evaluate how your clothes look that badly,

122
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,670
why don't you ask your Mom?

123
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,570
You're having dinner with her tonight, aren't you?

124
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,270
Why do you know about it?

125
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,870
Fantastic. It's a spotted eagle ray!

126
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,970
There it is... Shinichi's bad character.

127
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,470
Although he suddenly says things like he's seen right through you,

128
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,870
he'll keep you in suspense

129
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,370
and not tell you the reason why he knows what he does.

130
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,170
Answer me.

131
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,470
I didn't even tell Dad or Sonoko yet

132
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,470
why do you know when I'm going to be seeing Mom?

133
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,870
Don't tell me you snuck a look at my cell phone.

134
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,270
After you looked at Sonoko's text mail just a while ago,

135
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,370
you went back one mail

136
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,270
and checked what came in before, right?

137
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,070
It's only natural to think that you have other plans today

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,470
and were confirming the time.

139
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,570
But, you didn't look at the cell phone display back then, did you?

140
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,870
It's easy to tell by looking at the movement of your fingers

141
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,770
and that the person you're communicating with is your Mom.

142
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,070
You're not answering me at all.

143
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,470
A fashion magazine that you normally wouldn't buy

144
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,870
is in your bag, right, Ran?

145
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,470
There's a name card stuck in between the pages

146
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,470
and judging from the fact that you seem to be quite confident

147
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,870
about what you're wearing today,

148
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,070
I'm sure that you were scouted by an agent as a reader's model,

149
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,170
and had your picture taken,

150
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,870
and obviously got carried away with the idea,

151
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,370
enough to buy that fashion magazine.

152
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,570
You can also go around bragging that your picture may be shown

153
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,270
in this corner of this magazine.

154
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,870
That's something to be happy about...

155
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,870
They wouldn't give a name card to a girl

156
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,670
that they just wanted to make the numbers

157
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,670
so it's most likely that you'll make it on the magazine.

158
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,970
The problem is, scouts like that would only be seen

159
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,570
on the main street of 3-chome around here.

160
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,470
And it would be the long way around to come to this aquarium

161
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,070
The question is, why did you take that road.

162
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,970
You must've wanted to drop by somewhere before coming here.

163
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,570
The moment I looked at your lips,

164
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,270
I figured out the answer.

165
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,270
Lips?

166
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,070
It's a bit glossy.

167
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,270
Since you don't use lip cream,

168
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,470
you must've eaten some oily food.

169
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,170
There are fast food stores along that main street

170
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,470
so it's thinkable that you had a hamburger

171
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,670
to make up for the breakfast you missed.

172
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,770
But, since you were all for eating at the cafe here,

173
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,370
so I guess that's not it.

174
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,870
If so, the only thing thinkable is,

175
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,070
you took pieces of test foods

176
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,870
at the supermarket try-out corner!

177
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,270
That supermarket has a sufficient amount of try-out food corners

178
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,570
and today happens to be their bargain day.

179
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,470
You probably went there

180
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,370
to check out some side dishes for dinner,

181
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,870
which prices may come down even more later, right?

182
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,470
If so,

183
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,270
you're planning to use those side dishes

184
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,670
for your Dad's dinner tonight.

185
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,770
Why would you who are thrifty and a good cook do something like that?

186
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,170
Because you have no time to be doing so.

187
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,570
Because you promised to have dinner with somebody tonight.

188
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,170
Most naturally you're going to proudly wear those clothes

189
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,670
that caught the eyes of the scout that called out to you.

190
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,970
Of course the person you're going to dinner with

191
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,170
isn't Sonoko who has a cold.

192
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,570
Which means the only one left,

193
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,770
and judging from the way you looked when checking your text mail

194
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,270
that partner's got to be your Mom!

195
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,070
It seems you have other reasons for not being able to cook though.

196
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,270
Oh, and just because you came here

197
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,870
despite being late since your picture was taken

198
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,270
don't run anymore today, okay?

199
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,470
Why not?

200
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,070
That's because well...

201
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,970
It'll make you sad.

202
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,570
Why is running going to make me sad?

203
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,070
Oh, well, just make sure you don't run.

204
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,670
My name is "Ran" you know!

205
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,870
So, I was born to run.

206
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,270
Shut up already!

207
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,070
Okay, if you want it that way.

208
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,570
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

209
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,270
Quick!

210
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,170
Please let me through!

211
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,770
Shinichi.

212
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,070
I'm telling you, let me through.

213
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,862
I'm telling you, let me through.

214
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:03,062
Hey, are you all right?

215
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:04,362
Back off!

216
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:05,862
Pull away a bit more.

217
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,462
No good. No pulse already.

218
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,262
One pierce through the heart.

219
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,662
The murder weapon is that knife

220
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,562
that's sticking out of that convenience store bag.

221
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:23,662
Shinichi!

222
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:26,862
I brought the staff!

223
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:30,062
Close off the doorway of this aquarium immediately

224
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:32,362
and call the police!

225
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:33,562
The police?

226
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,862
Hurry!

227
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,162
Okay.

228
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,962
Make sure nobody goes near the corpse.

229
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,462
Corpse?

230
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:43,762
Don't tell me he's dead?

231
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:48,562
Yeah, he was stabbed by someone in the aquarium.

232
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,262
But, how?

233
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,862
We heard no scream or anything.

234
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,462
And yet, how'd you know?

235
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:57,162
I smelled it.

236
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:04,162
Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen

237
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,062
and its main substance is iron.

238
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,362
Well, when you lick a wound,

239
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:11,662
it tastes like rusty iron, doesn't it?

240
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:14,562
So, naturally it would smell like iron too.

241
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,962
I didn't smell anything though.

242
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:19,662
Just like a shark.

243
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:23,362
The shark's sense of smell is able to detect

244
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,962
even a drop of blood that has been diluted to 1/100.

245
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:29,162
They're sense of hearing is even more superior,

246
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:32,062
and they can hear an irregular low-frequency sound

247
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,962
of below 40 hertz from a distance of 2 kilometers away,

248
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:36,762
approach their prey with their sense of smell

249
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,762
that I just mentioned,

250
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:42,562
and they determine the precise location and go for it.

251
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:45,762
After smelling blood they go to the scene

252
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:49,762
and with all the faculties they possess they determine who the perp is.

253
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:52,562
Once they bite, they use their sharp teeth called evidence

254
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:55,862
and sink it deep into the perp until he gives himself in.

255
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:02,062
That's what a detective is.

256
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,062
I see.

257
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:12,862
The bossy youth who took charge of the crime scene

258
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:16,662
was you after all, Shinichi Kudo.

259
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:20,362
I just happened to be at the scene with Ran, so I couldn't help myself.

260
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:24,562
I asked around to see if there were any eye-witnesses of the perp

261
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:26,462
but, no luck.

262
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:31,562
The two of you dating at an aquarium?

263
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,062
Does it look that way?

264
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,662
It's nothing like that at all!

265
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:37,062
I was only playing!

266
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,462
He'll really think that's what it was

267
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:40,862
if we get all worked up about it, right?

268
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:44,762
How can you be that way when a person was just found dead?

269
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,962
It seems that the murder weapon is the knife that is beside the corpse.

270
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,462
The perp seems to have stabbed him

271
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,162
using the knife that was inside the convenience store bag.

272
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,562
The perp probably did so

273
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:59,562
to prevent the blood of the victim splattering on him.

274
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:01,962
The knife was placed sideways in the bag,

275
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,362
so that it could pierce right through the heart

276
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,762
without being blocked by the bones.

277
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:08,762
In addition, to make sure that a large amount of blood wouldn't splatter

278
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:12,862
the perp covered the knife with the jacket

279
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:15,062
and pulled it out carefully finally hiding the wound with the jacket

280
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:16,762
and left.

281
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:19,762
Well, then the victim probably would've shouted,

282
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,962
so I'm sure there were eye-witnesses around?

283
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:25,362
No, please look in back of his neck.

284
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:30,262
There's a trace of a stun gun being pushed against his neck.

285
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,962
If he was unconscious before he was stabbed,

286
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:34,762
he wouldn't have uttered a word.

287
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:38,862
When I got to him, there was still a bit of blood flowing,

288
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:41,362
so I think he was stabbed only a few minutes before that.

289
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:44,862
By the way, the stun gun was inside the inner pocket of his jacket.

290
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:48,462
This is it.

291
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,062
The perp probably said something

292
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:53,562
like there's a weird looking fish at the bottom of the aquarium

293
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,762
and made the victim look to the bottom inside.

294
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:59,162
Then, when the victim leaned against the rim of the fish tank to look in,

295
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:01,562
the perp probably pushed the stun gun against the back of the victim's head

296
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,562
rendered him unconscious.

297
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,562
That way, there would be no exaggerated movements,

298
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:08,062
and the victim would just slump down in place,

299
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:11,162
which after, the perp could stab him without making a scene.

300
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:15,662
Then, the victim may have known the killer.

301
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:19,762
There were no driver's license or name card in his wallet,

302
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,662
so first thing, we would have to identify the victim.

303
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:24,762
As to that...

304
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:29,062
the name of the victim is Kunihito Shumoto, age 26.

305
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:32,062
He part-times at a service station in Haido-cho.

306
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,662
It seems that he asked for a day off

307
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:36,162
saying that he had something to do today.

308
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:40,662
Therefore, I think that the victim came here with his girlfriend.

309
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:45,762
A girl about 5'4", wearing a mini skirt, who loves dolphins.

310
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:48,062
How do you know all that?

311
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:51,262
There was a cell phone inside the victim's pocket,

312
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:55,762
so I chose a number at random from his list of contacts!

313
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:58,062
"I found a cell phone,

314
00:17:58,062 --> 00:18:00,162
but would you know who the owner is?"

315
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,162
I left a message like so.

316
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:05,062
That's how I got the name.

317
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,262
So I went on and asked,

318
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,962
"Would you know where the owner is so I can deliver it?"

319
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,762
Then she told me where he was part-timing

320
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,862
so I called there too.

321
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:18,362
I told him not to do that on his own discretion though.

322
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:20,062
No...

323
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:21,762
No need for worry!

324
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:23,762
Because I said that they should call the police

325
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:28,162
the next time they received a similar type of call.

326
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:29,362
You're really...

327
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:31,662
Then, you found out about the girl that the victim could've been with

328
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,062
at the place he part-timed?

329
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:37,062
No. I looked at the receipt that was inside the wallet of the victim.

330
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:41,562
The store's a cafe inside this aquarium.

331
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:45,162
The time's about 15 minutes before I found the corpse.

332
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:46,662
The details on the receipt show

333
00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:49,762
one cup each of black tea and coffee

334
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,362
so, there's no mistake that he was with someone.

335
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:55,862
The time was 5 minutes before the dolphin show began

336
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:59,562
so, it seems they were killing time at the cafe till the time of the show.

337
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:05,162
A dolphin key holder was shown on it too,

338
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,462
but the victim had no such thing on him.

339
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:11,062
So, I can only think that he gave it to his dolphin-loving girlfriend.

340
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,262
Then how did you come up with her being around 5'4" tall

341
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:15,662
and wearing a mini skirt?

342
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:18,862
Well, I guess you wouldn't be able to understand yet, Ran.

343
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:22,262
What's that suppose to mean? How rude!

344
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,962
Just what do you mean, Shinichi?

345
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,362
From around the victim's shoulder,

346
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:34,762
elbow and thigh,

347
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:38,262
you can smell the fragrance of a woman's perfume, can't you?

348
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,662
The places where a woman puts on perfume

349
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,162
are the back of the ear lobes,

350
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:43,862
the back side of the hair,

351
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,962
the wrists, the sides of the stomach,

352
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:50,362
the hem of their skirts, the ankles of their feet and et cetera

353
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,862
but if the smell of perfume got on the victim,

354
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:55,162
when his woman companion walked hand in hand with him,

355
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,862
the perfume that smells on his shoulder

356
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,362
would've been the perfume she placed

357
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,462
behind her ear lobes and behind her hair

358
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:04,762
The victim is about 6' tall,

359
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:07,062
so judging from where the smell of the perfume is,

360
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:10,062
the woman would be about 5'4" tall.

361
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:13,562
Then, taking into consideration she may have been wearing high heels

362
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,062
being that she was on a date, subtract about 2 to 3 inches

363
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:19,162
making her about 5'2" tall.

364
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:22,162
The smell of perfume on his elbow is the perfume that was on her wrist,

365
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:26,762
and the smell on his thigh is probably what came from the hem of her skirt,

366
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,562
so judging from the location and the height of the woman,

367
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,462
she would've been wearing a mini skirt.

368
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:40,762
Well, people usually only put perfume on one part of their bodies, though.

369
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:44,262
Then, are you saying that the woman is not used to using perfume?

370
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:47,362
Not always so...

371
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,562
It could be that she always wears the same perfume

372
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,762
so her nose is used to it

373
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:56,662
and she is under the impression that she needs to use more.

374
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:58,262
Mom said so.

375
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:01,062
So, Ran, take care not to put too much on too.

376
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,862
None of your business!

377
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:07,162
But, why is that woman not showing up?

378
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,762
After all, her boyfriend's been murdered.

379
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:13,462
I wonder maybe they've just started going out together

380
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:16,262
and she doesn't want to get involved.

381
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:20,462
Or, maybe it's because she's the one who stabbed him.

382
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:23,462
Please collect all the cell phones,

383
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:28,662
cameras and videos of everyone here in this aquarium!

384
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,662
Maybe the scene when the perp stabbed the victim

385
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:33,262
has coincidentally been recorded.

386
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:34,762
I guess so.

387
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:37,062
"No entry"

388
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,462
Shinichi.

389
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,062
There are more than 100 here!

390
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:44,162
Are you going to check the images in all these devices?

391
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,962
Moreover,

392
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:49,662
most of the pictures are of fish.

393
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:51,362
I would think so.

394
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,762
"Kunihiro Shumoto. Incoming call"

395
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,462
"Kunihiro Shumoto"

396
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:56,262
"Incoming call"

397
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,962
Why are the phones ringing one after the other?

398
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:00,862
Before you came, Inspector,

399
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,262
I text mailed out to the people on the contact list of the victim's phone.

400
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:07,362
I'm calling the people who haven't responded to the mail,

401
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:09,662
one after the other now...

402
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,862
If I tell them that the police would be checking the picture,

403
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:15,662
I'm sure they'd all switch on their cell phones.

404
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:20,162
Then, let's call the three hear what they have to say!

405
00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:25,862
As well as ask them why they're ignoring his phone calls as well.

406
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,962
"Next Episode" -Nao's ex-boyfriend was murdered?

407
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:57,462
It's been a year since they split, though.

408
00:23:57,462 --> 00:24:01,462
I was just picked up by him last week.

409
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:04,162
Ran, will you lend me your cell phone?

410
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:05,762
Don't break it.

411
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:08,562
Because I finally got Dad to buy it for me.

412
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:12,062
I see, that's why the perp chose it.

413
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:20,662
Next Conan, "Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 2)"

414
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:39,062
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,262
"Gloves"

416
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,262
A surprised re-encounter.

417
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:44,062
Lovey-dovey revitalization strategy.

418
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,662
It ain't gonna work anyway.
