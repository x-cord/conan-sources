1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.929
That's probably the forensic officer.

2
00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.729
I'm sorry, Ran.

3
00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:04.129
Could you wait till later?

4
00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.229
Sure.

5
00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.629
It's genuine?

6
00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.329
That ring was genuine?

7
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.429
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.029
It was brought back to the station

9
00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.129
and taken to an appraiser right away,

10
00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:22.829
so there's no doubt about it.

11
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.729
Which means, the culprit wasn't after the ring.

12
00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:28.929
Yes, that's right.

13
00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.729
Then, why?

14
00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.629
For what reason did the culprit remove the ring?

15
00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.829
And when the ring was removed,

16
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.729
there was a strange trace left behind.

17
00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.229
A strange trace?

18
00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:42.429
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.329
Over here.

20
00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.529
Although it seems to be a very old mark...

21
00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:49.729
It's a round, black mark.

22
00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.529
I wonder if it's a trace of blood?

23
00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:53.129
Blood...

24
00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729
Why would there be blood here?

25
00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.629
He could've been shaving

26
00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.429
and cut himself pretty deep.

27
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.529
Then he may have touched the place.

28
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:07.429
See, there's a cut spot under his right jaw.

29
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.429
No doubt about it.

30
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.629
By the way,

31
00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:11.929
from the coffee cup,

32
00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.429
the saucer,

33
00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:14.929
coffee maker,

34
00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.429
and the doorknob,

35
00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.729
nothing other than the victim's fingerprints have been found.

36
00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.229
I see.

37
00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.429
Excuse me, Officer Takagi...

38
00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.629
What is it?

39
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:30.929
I know this is a very inappropriate time to say something like this,

40
00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.929
but I just have to say it.

41
00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.029
What is it, Ran?

42
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.229
Congratulations on your engagement.

43
00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.429
What?

44
00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:42.829
Ran?

45
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.229
Because see,

46
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.629
isn't the ring that Officer Sato is wearing

47
00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:47.629
on her left hand ring finger

48
00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.729
an engagement ring?

49
00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.929
It looks to be so.

50
00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.129
Looks to be so?

51
00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.529
Aren't you the one who sent it to her, Officer Takagi?

52
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.629
I'm sure she got it from somebody, somewhere.

53
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:04.229
You mean she switched to somebody

54
00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.629
who's more reliable and good-looking?

55
00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:08.029
Dad!

56
00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.529
Could be.

57
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.029
What do you mean, could be?

58
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.929
Why don't you go and ask her straight?

59
00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.029
I wish I could.

60
00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.329
I'm afraid what her answer might be.

61
00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.329
Really.

62
00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.229
I feel like I'm walking on a tightrope.

63
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.129
Maybe you already fell off the tightrope?

64
00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.329
Could be.

65
00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.929
-That's what it was. -Dad, stop teasing him!

66
00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.629
That's why the culprit removed the ring.

67
00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.929
The culprit did it

68
00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:43.529
to carry out the "tightrope walk" in the locked room!

69
00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.629
But something bothers me.

70
00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.829
The door and the window of the room were locked.

71
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.529
Mr. Moroguchi is found in the room dead

72
00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.029
after drinking coffee poisoned with cyanide.

73
00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.629
In his left hand,

74
00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.029
he is holding the key of the room that has no spare.

75
00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.729
The only thing that was open

76
00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:03.929
was the ventilation window

77
00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.929
that a child can barely pass through.

78
00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.329
With the information we have now,

79
00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.229
it could be taken that Mr. Moroguchi committed suicide,

80
00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.229
not wanting anyone else in this villa to be suspected.

81
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.729
But the question is,

82
00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.629
why was the ring that he had on his left ring finger

83
00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.529
on upside down?

84
00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.929
If it's just as she says,

85
00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.829
and Mr. Moroguchi didn't take this ring off

86
00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.029
most of the time.

87
00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.029
And taking into consideration that he was not the type

88
00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.829
that would do something sloppy like wear his ring upside down.

89
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.529
After the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi to death,

90
00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.529
the culprit for some reason, took off the ring

91
00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:42.729
and when putting it back on his finger,

92
00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.629
put it back on upside down.

93
00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.429
Maybe the culprit removed the ring

94
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.829
only because there was blood on it?

95
00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.829
Well, there was blood under the ring

96
00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.529
that got on when he shaved, right?

97
00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.429
That's why the culprit may have taken it off once

98
00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.129
in order to wipe the blood off.

99
00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.429
No. But if so,

100
00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.429
the blood on the finger would've been wiped off too.

101
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.429
Even if the culprit were to wipe the blood off the ring,

102
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.529
if the blood on the finger isn't wiped off,

103
00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:12.929
it would be meaningless.

104
00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.029
I think the culprit wiped the blood off

105
00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.429
without taking the ring off, don't you?

106
00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:17.929
I guess so.

107
00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:21.129
Maybe that man...

108
00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.829
was sewing?

109
00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.629
Sewing?

110
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.029
Just what do you mean, Conan?

111
00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.229
Yes, because you see,

112
00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.529
the other day when Ran made me the rag to take to school,

113
00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:35.829
she was also wearing a ring, right, Ran?

114
00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.329
Are you talking about the finger shield?

115
00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:41.929
When you wear it,

116
00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:43.229
it makes it easier to pull the string

117
00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.829
through the hole of the needle, right?

118
00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:46.729
No! Conan.

119
00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.029
A finger shield is worn

120
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.029
to hold the back of the needle down.

121
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.429
What?

122
00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:55.729
I thought that you wore it

123
00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.929
and pulled something through the hole of the needle!

124
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.129
I guess I made a mistake.

125
00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:45.429
Pulled something through the hole of the key?

126
00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:47.529
So, the ring?

127
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:56.429
I... I get it!

128
00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:57.729
Pops!

129
00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.229
Rubberband!

130
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:01.729
Rubberband?

131
00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:03.548
First, you take the rubberbands

132
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:04.316
but since Officer Sato is here...

133
00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:07.516
She almost saw through the other time too.

134
00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:08.616
I guess I'll just have to

135
00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.316
lead him into realizing what really happened.

136
00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:14.216
Right, Pops!

137
00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:16.116
I don't think that even a circus performer

138
00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:18.816
could do something like that!

139
00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:20.316
Circus?

140
00:07:20.316 --> 00:07:23.116
You mean magician, don't you?

141
00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:26.316
But Officer Takagi just mentioned it a while ago.

142
00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:28.716
He said tightrope.

143
00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:33.016
This means that you both

144
00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.816
are going to do a circus performance, right?

145
00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:37.116
Hey, Conan!

146
00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:39.816
-That's... -What is it, Officer Takagi?

147
00:07:39.816 --> 00:07:41.116
Conan.

148
00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:44.516
-Much too cruel. -Wait. Tightrope?

149
00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:46.216
Tightrope...

150
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.816
I see! There's the stuff!

151
00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:50.616
The thing that can be used to retrieve the rubberband right away

152
00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:51.616
without getting stuck on the ring.

153
00:07:51.616 --> 00:07:54.416
A long and slender thing!

154
00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:57.116
You finally got it, Pops.

155
00:07:57.116 --> 00:08:01.416
That is the thing that editor Ms. Anabuki...

156
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.116
The metal tape measure!

157
00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:08.416
Are you saying that the ring

158
00:08:08.416 --> 00:08:10.616
was pulled through the tape measure?

159
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:14.416
No, the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape.

160
00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:15.916
And then that tape measure

161
00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:17.616
was pulled through the hole of the key

162
00:08:17.616 --> 00:08:19.216
and was taken from outside the ventilation window

163
00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:21.916
to the palm of Mr. Moroguchi's hand!

164
00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:23.616
Just like in tightrope!

165
00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:25.316
Hey, hold it!

166
00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:27.716
When was that tape measure pulled through

167
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.116
the hole of the key?

168
00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:30.616
That's of course,

169
00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:33.616
right after the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi!

170
00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:35.916
The key was pulled through the tape beforehand,

171
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.016
then the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape,

172
00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:40.216
then extended over to the ventilation window.

173
00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:41.416
If the tape measure

174
00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:44.316
is hooked onto the rim of the window along with the key,

175
00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:46.316
after committing the crime, all that needs to be done

176
00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:48.516
is to pull the tape measure up.

177
00:08:48.516 --> 00:08:50.116
Then the key will move along the tape measure

178
00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:54.116
all the way up to Mr. Moroguch's palm!

179
00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:57.216
Of course, it can be retrieved with the push of a button too!

180
00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:01.516
So,

181
00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:02.816
if the culprit pulls the key through the tape

182
00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:04.816
before leaving the room,

183
00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:07.516
it would be impossible to lock the door, right?

184
00:09:07.516 --> 00:09:09.916
Oh, I see.

185
00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.216
No, no.

186
00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:12.716
Maybe the culprit extended the tape measure

187
00:09:12.716 --> 00:09:15.616
after committing the murder and leaving the room,

188
00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:19.616
and after going over to the ventilation window from outside.

189
00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:20.716
See!

190
00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:22.416
Metal tape measures are stiff

191
00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:23.816
so the culprit probably used it like a stick,

192
00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:26.316
and hooked the tip of the measure nicely

193
00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.316
onto the ring of the dead body.

194
00:09:28.316 --> 00:09:30.616
Only up to 1 meter though.

195
00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:33.116
If it goes beyond that, it'll break.

196
00:09:33.116 --> 00:09:34.616
It's impossible to get it to reach the bed,

197
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.016
much less, the palm of his hand.

198
00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:38.316
Besides,

199
00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:40.116
if the culprit only had to hook the tape measure onto the ring,

200
00:09:40.116 --> 00:09:42.416
there's no need to remove the ring at all, is there?

201
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:44.816
That... that's true.

202
00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:47.116
Yes. If there's a narrow string-like thing,

203
00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:49.216
then maybe it's possible.

204
00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:54.116
But the three suspects had nothing like that on them.

205
00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:56.516
The vicinity around the villa is being investigated,

206
00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:59.816
but there's been no report of anything like that being found yet.

207
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:02.116
Of course nothing would be found, right?

208
00:10:02.116 --> 00:10:03.616
Unlike the rubberband,

209
00:10:03.616 --> 00:10:05.416
there could never be something that won't get stuck by the ring,

210
00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:08.816
that is thin and slippery like a long string,

211
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:10.116
that's so convenient

212
00:10:10.116 --> 00:10:11.616
that it's usually wound around something

213
00:10:11.616 --> 00:10:13.516
like a tape measure when not in use.

214
00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:15.416
Wait!

215
00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:18.316
Hey! Don't tell me that's...

216
00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.216
-Cassette tape! -Cassette tape!

217
00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:23.616
I see.

218
00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:25.216
If a cassette tape were used,

219
00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:26.916
the tape could be pulled out to quite a length

220
00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:28.516
and put through the ring.

221
00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:31.016
Then, if the tip of the tape and the cassette itself

222
00:10:31.016 --> 00:10:33.416
are left outside the ventilation window...

223
00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:35.416
After killing Mr. Moroguchi with poison,

224
00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:37.716
the culprit can leave the room, lock the door,

225
00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:39.716
put the tip of the tape that is left

226
00:10:39.716 --> 00:10:42.716
outside the ventilation window through the hole of the key

227
00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:45.216
and hold the tape up high...

228
00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:47.116
Then, due to gravity,

229
00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:49.316
the key would slide along the tape

230
00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:51.816
and reach the palm of the dead man's hand.

231
00:10:51.816 --> 00:10:53.816
Then, if the tape is wound back,

232
00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:57.016
it will slide through the hole of the key and the ring,

233
00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:58.516
and return to the cassette,

234
00:10:58.516 --> 00:11:01.816
succeeding in locking the room up!

235
00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:05.116
The one who could've used this trick is

236
00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:08.916
someone who usually carries around cassette tapes

237
00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:11.316
and wouldn't be suspected by the police

238
00:11:11.316 --> 00:11:13.816
even if investigated.

239
00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:16.316
Is there such a person here...

240
00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:18.916
Mr. Dejima, the writer.

241
00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:20.516
You're the only one thinkable.

242
00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:24.116
You probably said something like,

243
00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.716
wanting to make the finishing touches

244
00:11:25.716 --> 00:11:29.416
on the talk show that was scheduled for this morning

245
00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:32.016
and got Mr. Moroguchi to let you into this room.

246
00:11:33.416 --> 00:11:35.016
And when he was off his guard,

247
00:11:35.016 --> 00:11:37.216
you mixed cyanide into his coffee

248
00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:39.016
and poisoned him to death.

249
00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:40.516
Then you set up the locked room trick

250
00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:42.816
using the method that was just explained.

251
00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:45.016
Well? Am I wrong?

252
00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:52.916
Well, we'll find out if we check

253
00:11:52.916 --> 00:11:55.716
the cassette tapes that you have.

254
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:58.916
I'll bet you want to say that it'll be wrinkled up,

255
00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:01.216
but did I say that myself?

256
00:12:01.216 --> 00:12:02.416
This recorder...

257
00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:05.816
is not working well.

258
00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:08.916
There are many tapes that are wrinkled.

259
00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.916
Besides, with all the noise it makes

260
00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:12.616
when the tape is rewound,

261
00:12:12.616 --> 00:12:14.716
someone is bound to have heard it!

262
00:12:17.616 --> 00:12:19.816
If without using this,

263
00:12:19.816 --> 00:12:22.216
the tape was rewound manually,

264
00:12:22.216 --> 00:12:24.216
the wrinkled parts of the tape

265
00:12:24.216 --> 00:12:25.816
would be spread over a large portion of the tape.

266
00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:27.416
Please feel free to check them.

267
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:30.016
I have no such tape on me.

268
00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:33.016
No.

269
00:12:33.016 --> 00:12:35.116
A pencil!

270
00:12:35.116 --> 00:12:36.716
If you use the pencil

271
00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:38.116
that you borrowed from Mr. Moroguchi last night,

272
00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:39.516
stick the pencil into the hole of the cassette

273
00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:41.416
and wind the tape,

274
00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:43.316
the recorder doesn't have to be used,

275
00:12:43.316 --> 00:12:46.716
to rewind the tape in a short time

276
00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:49.116
without damaging the tape that much.

277
00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:52.416
I used to do it a lot when I was a kid too.

278
00:12:52.416 --> 00:12:56.516
After pulling a lot of tape out for fun,

279
00:12:56.516 --> 00:13:00.416
I rewound the tape by placing a pencil on my lap.

280
00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:04.416
Besides, when Officer Sato mentioned checking the tapes,

281
00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:08.116
she didn't say it to mean checking on wrinkled tapes.

282
00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:09.916
Like mentioned before,

283
00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:13.016
blood was on the base of the left ring finger,

284
00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:14.516
where he wore the ring.

285
00:13:14.516 --> 00:13:15.816
However, for some reason,

286
00:13:15.816 --> 00:13:17.816
there was no blood on one part.

287
00:13:17.816 --> 00:13:20.316
Therefore, among the tapes that you have,

288
00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:22.416
there should be one that was used

289
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:24.816
to tightrope across the locked room

290
00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:28.516
with Mr. Moroguchi's blood on it.

291
00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.216
Mr. Dejima.

292
00:13:30.216 --> 00:13:33.016
Don't tell me that you killed him because of Akiba...

293
00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:36.916
Tightrope...

294
00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.316
Akiba used to tell me too,

295
00:13:39.316 --> 00:13:41.816
that getting along with Mr. Moroguchi

296
00:13:41.816 --> 00:13:45.416
was always like walking on a tightrope.

297
00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:47.316
Tightrope?

298
00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:50.416
Akiba used to be a quiet man,

299
00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:52.216
but ever since he became in charge of Mr. Moroguchi,

300
00:13:52.216 --> 00:13:55.816
he always had bandages around him somewhere.

301
00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:58.216
What do you think it was?

302
00:13:58.216 --> 00:13:59.616
He was trying out

303
00:13:59.616 --> 00:14:01.616
something that Mr. Moroguchi told him to try.

304
00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:04.316
He was testing whether the murder trick

305
00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:05.916
that Mr. Moroguchi thought up would really work,

306
00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:08.316
using his own body.

307
00:14:08.316 --> 00:14:10.816
Of course, he was very careful

308
00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:13.416
so as not to really die doing it.

309
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:16.016
Hey, then don't tell me that you...

310
00:14:16.016 --> 00:14:19.716
That thing about Akiba dying in a locked room...

311
00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:21.316
I found it when I was cleaning out

312
00:14:21.316 --> 00:14:23.716
Akiba's desk at the company.

313
00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:25.716
"Mr. Moroguchi's Trick Note"

314
00:14:25.716 --> 00:14:29.016
A notebook with the exact method of dying

315
00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:30.616
that Akiba died of!

316
00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:34.216
Then, why didn't you submit it to the police?

317
00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:35.916
No use.

318
00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.516
Mr. Moroguchi would probably say

319
00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:41.616
Akiba did it of his own free will, even if he were questioned.

320
00:14:41.616 --> 00:14:44.316
But it was an accident, wasn't it?

321
00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:48.916
Mr. Moroguchi said the following at another interview.

322
00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:50.416
At this age,

323
00:14:50.416 --> 00:14:52.716
I'm finally beginning to understand

324
00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:54.516
the feeling of a murderer.

325
00:14:54.516 --> 00:14:55.916
Nothing can be more delightful than this

326
00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:58.616
for a detective story writer.

327
00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:00.016
That's what he said.

328
00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:03.416
So that's when I was convinced

329
00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:07.316
that what Mr. Moroguchi wanted to know using Akiba

330
00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:09.716
was not reality

331
00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:13.216
but rather, the mentality of a killer.

332
00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:43.716
Well, something's been bothering me for quite some time.

333
00:16:43.716 --> 00:16:45.616
What is it?

334
00:16:45.616 --> 00:16:47.316
What do you mean what is it?

335
00:16:47.316 --> 00:16:49.716
What's this thing about tightrope with me?

336
00:16:49.716 --> 00:16:51.116
Just what does that mean?

337
00:16:51.116 --> 00:16:54.116
Well, that's... You see...

338
00:16:54.116 --> 00:16:55.516
The ring!

339
00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:58.616
Officer Sato, you say that you don't like jewelry

340
00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:00.016
and yet you're wearing a ring.

341
00:17:00.016 --> 00:17:02.916
Officer Takagi wants to know why.

342
00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:06.216
Maybe I should've come along with Pops by train.

343
00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:12.416
You mean this good luck charm to keep away evil?

344
00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:14.316
-Good luck charm? -Good luck charm?

345
00:17:14.316 --> 00:17:15.916
That's all?

346
00:17:15.916 --> 00:17:18.016
Just what do you mean?

347
00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:20.316
Silver and turquoise.

348
00:17:20.316 --> 00:17:22.916
Wearing this on the left ring finger,

349
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:25.016
keeps bad luck and bugs away from me,

350
00:17:25.016 --> 00:17:26.016
so I get to kill two birds with one stone.

351
00:17:26.016 --> 00:17:29.416
That's what Yumi told me, so I decided to get one too!

352
00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:34.516
Because, you see, I'm cursed and hate bugs too.

353
00:17:34.516 --> 00:17:38.416
Well, I don't think Yumi was really talking about bugs.

354
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:40.316
If... if so...

355
00:17:40.316 --> 00:17:42.016
Officer Sato!

356
00:17:42.016 --> 00:17:46.016
Please wear my ring on your left ring finger!

357
00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:50.716
Okay.

358
00:17:53.716 --> 00:17:55.616
Oh, boy, am I in trouble?

359
00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:59.016
I'll bet I'm going to get it from everybody today.

360
00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:02.516
I mean, after all, Officer Sato's going to be wearing my ring

361
00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:05.916
on her left ring finger.

362
00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:07.516
"First Investigation Division"

363
00:18:07.516 --> 00:18:10.116
I guess I'll act upright

364
00:18:10.116 --> 00:18:12.016
and be a man today.

365
00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:16.916
Takagi!

366
00:18:16.916 --> 00:18:19.216
I heard about Officer Sato's ring.

367
00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:20.716
Here it comes.

368
00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:22.916
That ring...

369
00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:26.016
was a lucky charm to keep away evil, right?

370
00:18:26.016 --> 00:18:28.216
Why does everybody know about it?

371
00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:29.716
Don't worry about it.

372
00:18:29.716 --> 00:18:31.416
No big deal!

373
00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:33.916
But to think she didn't know what it meant

374
00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:36.216
to wear a ring on her left ring finger...

375
00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:39.716
Her being naive makes her even more attractive.

376
00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:42.716
Come to think of it, I didn't tell her

377
00:18:42.716 --> 00:18:45.016
what that ring means yet.

378
00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:46.516
Oh, well...

379
00:19:07.316 --> 00:19:09.516
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:11.416
"Take-out delivery service".

381
00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.416
In the next episode, a famous person will appear.

382
00:19:13.416 --> 00:19:16.016
A friend of ours is a celebrity!
