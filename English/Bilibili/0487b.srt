1
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,505
Okay,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,173
while we're waiting for the forensic officers to arrive,

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,375
I'd like you to answer my questions.

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,178
I would like to know where all of you were

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,379
and what you were doing

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,381
before finding Mr. Moroguchi's dead body.

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,283
First, let's start with you, Mr. Dejima.

8
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,585
I... I was in my room

9
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,288
fixing this tape recorder.

10
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,090
Something seems to be wrong with it.

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,492
The tape inside is all wrinkled

12
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,894
and when I try to rewind it...

13
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,896
See! This is how it sounds.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,201
True. It does sound funny.

15
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,303
Next. How about you, Mr. Tarumi?

16
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:39,473
After I finishing setting things up for shooting,

17
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,474
I returned to my room

18
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,577
and was organizing the negatives for a different job.

19
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,479
I bundled them up with this rubber band.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,881
Okay.

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,484
Then, next Ms. Anabuki.

22
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,985
I was also in my room

23
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,888
looking over the draft of another writer.

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,490
Ms. Anabuki.

25
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,592
You had a metal tape on you, didn't you?

26
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,794
Do you always carry it around?

27
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,396
What? Yes.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,198
Because Mr. Moroguchi usually tells me

29
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,901
to measure things, like the size of the fonts.

30
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,603
But if it's to measure the fonts,

31
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,505
won't a ruler do?

32
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,774
Hey, Sonny.

33
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,576
She not only had to measure fonts,

34
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,879
but all kinds of other stuff too.

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,481
Like doors and windows

36
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,783
that were likely to be used as tricks.

37
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,185
You sure know a lot.

38
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,689
The late Akiba used to tell me all these things.

39
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,390
All three of us

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,192
joined the company together with Mr. Akiba, so...

41
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,194
I quit partway

42
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,296
and became a free-lance writer though.

43
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,600
I see. Is that right?

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,003
Officer Sato...

45
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,272
It has nothing to do with the case, but...

46
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,274
What is it, Ran?

47
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,178
That's probably the forensic officer.

48
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,980
I'm sorry, Ran.

49
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,381
Could you wait till later?

50
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,485
Sure.

51
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,891
It's genuine?

52
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,593
That ring was genuine?

53
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,694
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,296
It was brought back to the station

55
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,398
and taken to an appraiser right away,

56
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,100
so there's no doubt about it.

57
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,004
Which means, the culprit wasn't after the ring.

58
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,173
Yes, that's right.

59
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,974
Then, why?

60
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,878
For what reason did the culprit remove the ring?

61
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,081
And when the ring was removed,

62
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,983
there was a strange trace left behind.

63
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,485
A strange trace?

64
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,686
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,588
Over here.

66
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,790
Although it seems to be a very old mark...

67
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,993
It's a round, black mark.

68
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,795
I wonder if it's a trace of blood?

69
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,397
Blood...

70
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,999
Why would there be blood here?

71
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,901
He could've been shaving

72
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,703
and cut himself pretty deep.

73
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:53,774
Then he may have touched the place.

74
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,678
See, there's a cut spot under his right jaw.

75
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,680
No doubt about it.

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,881
By the way,

77
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,182
from the coffee cup,

78
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,684
the saucer,

79
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,185
coffee maker,

80
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,687
and the doorknob,

81
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,990
nothing other than the victim's fingerprints have been found.

82
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,491
I see.

83
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,697
Excuse me, Officer Takagi...

84
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,899
What is it?

85
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,201
I know this is a very inappropriate time to say something like this,

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,203
but I just have to say it.

87
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,273
What is it, Ran?

88
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,475
Congratulations on your engagement.

89
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,676
What?

90
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,080
Ran?

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,481
Because see,

92
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,882
isn't the ring that Officer Sato is wearing

93
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,885
on her left hand ring finger

94
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,987
an engagement ring?

95
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,192
It looks to be so.

96
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,394
Looks to be so?

97
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,797
Aren't you the one who sent it to her, Officer Takagi?

98
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm sure she got it from somebody, somewhere.

99
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,501
You mean she switched to somebody

100
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,904
who's more reliable and good-looking?

101
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,305
Dad!

102
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,773
Could be.

103
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,275
What do you mean, could be?

104
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,177
Why don't you go and ask her straight?

105
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,282
I wish I could.

106
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,584
I'm afraid what her answer might be.

107
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,585
Really.

108
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,487
I feel like I'm walking on a tightrope.

109
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,393
Maybe you already fell off the tightrope?

110
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,594
Could be.

111
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,197
-That's what it was. -Dad, stop teasing him!

112
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,901
That's why the culprit removed the ring.

113
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,203
The culprit did it

114
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,774
to carry out the "tightrope walk" in the locked room!

115
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,877
But something bothers me.

116
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,080
The door and the window of the room were locked.

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,783
Mr. Moroguchi is found in the room dead

118
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,286
after drinking coffee poisoned with cyanide.

119
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,888
In his left hand,

120
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,291
he is holding the key of the room that has no spare.

121
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,993
The only thing that was open

122
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,194
was the ventilation window

123
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,196
that a child can barely pass through.

124
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,599
With the information we have now,

125
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,501
it could be taken that Mr. Moroguchi committed suicide,

126
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,472
not wanting anyone else in this villa to be suspected.

127
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:07,974
But the question is,

128
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,878
why was the ring that he had on his left ring finger

129
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,782
on upside down?

130
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,184
If it's just as she says,

131
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,086
and Mr. Moroguchi didn't take this ring off

132
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,288
most of the time.

133
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,289
And taking into consideration that he was not the type

134
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,093
that would do something sloppy like wear his ring upside down.

135
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,795
After the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi to death,

136
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,798
the culprit for some reason, took off the ring

137
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,000
and when putting it back on his finger,

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,902
put it back on upside down.

139
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,705
Maybe the culprit removed the ring

140
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,075
only because there was blood on it?

141
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,078
Well, there was blood under the ring

142
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,781
that got on when he shaved, right?

143
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,684
That's why the culprit may have taken it off once

144
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,386
in order to wipe the blood off.

145
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,688
No. But if so,

146
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,691
the blood on the finger would've been wiped off too.

147
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,693
Even if the culprit were to wipe the blood off the ring,

148
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,795
if the blood on the finger isn't wiped off,

149
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,196
it would be meaningless.

150
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,298
I think the culprit wiped the blood off

151
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,700
without taking the ring off, don't you?

152
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,201
I guess so.

153
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,405
Maybe that man...

154
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,074
was sewing?

155
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,876
Sewing?

156
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,278
Just what do you mean, Conan?

157
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,480
Yes, because you see,

158
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,784
the other day when Ran made me the rag to take to school,

159
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,086
she was also wearing a ring, right, Ran?

160
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,590
Are you talking about the finger shield?

161
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,192
When you wear it,

162
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,493
it makes it easier to pull the string

163
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,095
through the hole of the needle, right?

164
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,997
No! Conan.

165
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,299
A finger shield is worn

166
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,302
to hold the back of the needle down.

167
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,703
What?

168
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,972
I thought that you wore it

169
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,176
and pulled something through the hole of the needle!

170
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,381
I guess I made a mistake.

171
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,687
Pulled something through the hole of the key?

172
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,789
So, the ring?

173
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,698
I... I get it!

174
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:20,999
Pops!

175
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,501
Rubberband!

176
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,003
Rubberband?

177
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:28,306
First, you take the rubberbands

178
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,708
and hook them up together.

179
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,510
You pull the ring through the rubberbands

180
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,378
and make a sling.

181
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:35,380
Then the front and back part of the key

182
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,582
are hooked on to each end of the rubberband.

183
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,683
The key was then

184
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,986
flown from the ventilation window into the room!

185
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:42,387
The length of the rubberbands

186
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:43,488
can be adjusted to the desired length

187
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,991
just by connecting rubberbands!

188
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,793
Of course, the culprit did this

189
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:49,594
after poisoning Mr. Moroguchi,

190
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,998
locking the room up and leaving.

191
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:55,500
And the only one who could've done this is

192
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,601
the one who still has

193
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,604
a number of rubberbands around his wrist.

194
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,807
Cameraman, Mr. Tarumi.

195
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,708
You!

196
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,479
How about it? Am I wrong?

197
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,081
No. I... I didn't do it!

198
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,384
Pops, wrong.

199
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,587
But if he were the one,

200
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:19,191
the rubberbands should still be in the room, shouldn't they?

201
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:21,993
After all, they were flown in here together with the key.

202
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,095
Then, it must've been just one side!

203
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,398
The culprit held one end of the rubberband

204
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:29,401
and passed the key through the other end to fling it!

205
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,502
That way,

206
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:32,204
he can retrieve the rubberband

207
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:34,406
by pulling on the end that he is holding!

208
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:37,709
Even if the culprit were able to retrieve it that way,

209
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,177
the knot made in the rubberband

210
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,179
would hook on to the ring and be pulled.

211
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,280
So, I think that the victim's arm

212
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,083
would be hanging facing outward from the bed.

213
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,284
Besides,

214
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:47,786
I wonder if the culprit would choose to carry out

215
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:50,288
an extremely difficult feat as to fly the key into the room

216
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,290
and place it on the victim's hand?

217
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,193
If the method fails, it would just look as if

218
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:58,997
the key was thrown in from the ventilation window.

219
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,500
That's true too.

220
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,202
I mean, it couldn't be taken any other way!

221
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:07,205
Darn. I'd like to put Pops to sleep like always

222
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,307
and start a deduction show,

223
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:12,377
but since Officer Sato is here...

224
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,580
She almost saw through the other time too.

225
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,681
I guess I'll just have to

226
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,385
lead him into realizing what really happened.

227
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,287
Right, Pops!

228
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,189
I don't think that even a circus performer

229
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,892
could do something like that!

230
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,393
Circus?

231
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:31,196
You mean magician, don't you?

232
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,399
But Officer Takagi just mentioned it a while ago.

233
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,801
He said tightrope.

234
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,106
This means that you both

235
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:42,908
are going to do a circus performance, right?

236
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,210
Hey, Conan!

237
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,879
-That's... -What is it, Officer Takagi?

238
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,180
Conan.

239
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,584
-Much too cruel. -Wait. Tightrope?

240
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,286
Tightrope...

241
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,888
I see! There's the stuff!

242
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,690
The thing that can be used to retrieve the rubberband right away

243
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,691
without getting stuck on the ring.

244
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,494
A long and slender thing!

245
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:05,196
You finally got it, Pops.

246
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:09,501
That is the thing that editor Ms. Anabuki...

247
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,204
The metal tape measure!

248
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:16,508
Are you saying that the ring

249
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,710
was pulled through the tape measure?

250
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,480
No, the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape.

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,982
And then that tape measure

252
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,684
was pulled through the hole of the key

253
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,285
and was taken from outside the ventilation window

254
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:29,988
to the palm of Mr. Moroguchi's hand!

255
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:31,690
Just like in tightrope!

256
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,391
Hey, hold it!

257
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,794
When was that tape measure pulled through

258
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,195
the hole of the key?

259
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:38,697
That's of course,

260
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:41,700
right after the culprit poisoned Mr. Moroguchi!

261
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,002
The key was pulled through the tape beforehand,

262
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,104
then the ring was hooked on to the tip of the tape,

263
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,306
then extended over to the ventilation window.

264
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:49,507
If the tape measure

265
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:52,377
is hooked onto the rim of the window along with the key,

266
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:54,379
after committing the crime, all that needs to be done

267
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,581
is to pull the tape measure up.

268
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,183
Then the key will move along the tape measure

269
00:10:58,183 --> 00:11:02,187
all the way up to Mr. Moroguch's palm!

270
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:05,290
Of course, it can be retrieved with the push of a button too!

271
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,594
So,

272
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,895
if the culprit pulls the key through the tape

273
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,897
before leaving the room,

274
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:15,600
it would be impossible to lock the door, right?

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,003
Oh, I see.

276
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:19,304
No, no.

277
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,805
Maybe the culprit extended the tape measure

278
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,708
after committing the murder and leaving the room,

279
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,679
and after going over to the ventilation window from outside.

280
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,780
See!

281
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,482
Metal tape measures are stiff

282
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,883
so the culprit probably used it like a stick,

283
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:34,386
and hooked the tip of the measure nicely

284
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:36,388
onto the ring of the dead body.

285
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:38,690
Only up to 1 meter though.

286
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,192
If it goes beyond that, it'll break.

287
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:42,694
It's impossible to get it to reach the bed,

288
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,096
much less, the palm of his hand.

289
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,398
Besides,

290
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:48,199
if the culprit only had to hook the tape measure onto the ring,

291
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:50,502
there's no need to remove the ring at all, is there?

292
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,904
That... that's true.

293
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,206
Yes. If there's a narrow string-like thing,

294
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,308
then maybe it's possible.

295
00:11:57,308 --> 00:12:02,180
But the three suspects had nothing like that on them.

296
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,582
The vicinity around the villa is being investigated,

297
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,886
but there's been no report of anything like that being found yet.

298
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:10,188
Of course nothing would be found, right?

299
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,690
Unlike the rubberband,

300
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,491
there could never be something that won't get stuck by the ring,

301
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:16,895
that is thin and slippery like a long string,

302
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,196
that's so convenient

303
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,697
that it's usually wound around something

304
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,599
like a tape measure when not in use.

305
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,501
Wait!

306
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:26,404
Hey! Don't tell me that's...

307
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,306
-Cassette tape! -Cassette tape!

308
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,710
I see.

309
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,278
If a cassette tape were used,

310
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:34,979
the tape could be pulled out to quite a length

311
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,581
and put through the ring.

312
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,084
Then, if the tip of the tape and the cassette itself

313
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:41,486
are left outside the ventilation window...

314
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,488
After killing Mr. Moroguchi with poison,

315
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,790
the culprit can leave the room, lock the door,

316
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,792
put the tip of the tape that is left

317
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,795
outside the ventilation window through the hole of the key

318
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,298
and hold the tape up high...

319
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,200
Then, due to gravity,

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,402
the key would slide along the tape

321
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,904
and reach the palm of the dead man's hand.

322
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,906
Then, if the tape is wound back,

323
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,110
it will slide through the hole of the key and the ring,

324
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,578
and return to the cassette,

325
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,881
succeeding in locking the room up!

326
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,184
The one who could've used this trick is

327
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,988
someone who usually carries around cassette tapes

328
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,390
and wouldn't be suspected by the police

329
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,893
even if investigated.

330
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,395
Is there such a person here...

331
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,998
Mr. Dejima, the writer.

332
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:28,600
You're the only one thinkable.

333
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,203
You probably said something like,

334
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,805
wanting to make the finishing touches

335
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:37,509
on the talk show that was scheduled for this morning

336
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,078
and got Mr. Moroguchi to let you into this room.

337
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,081
And when he was off his guard,

338
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,283
you mixed cyanide into his coffee

339
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,085
and poisoned him to death.

340
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,586
Then you set up the locked room trick

341
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,889
using the method that was just explained.

342
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:53,091
Well? Am I wrong?

343
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,999
Well, we'll find out if we check

344
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,801
the cassette tapes that you have.

345
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,005
I'll bet you want to say that it'll be wrinkled up,

346
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,307
but did I say that myself?

347
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,508
This recorder...

348
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,878
is not working well.

349
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:16,981
There are many tapes that are wrinkled.

350
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,983
Besides, with all the noise it makes

351
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,685
when the tape is rewound,

352
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,787
someone is bound to have heard it!

353
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,892
If without using this,

354
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,295
the tape was rewound manually,

355
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,297
the wrinkled parts of the tape

356
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,898
would be spread over a large portion of the tape.

357
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:35,500
Please feel free to check them.

358
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,102
I have no such tape on me.

359
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:41,105
No.

360
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,208
A pencil!

361
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,809
If you use the pencil

362
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,177
that you borrowed from Mr. Moroguchi last night,

363
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,579
stick the pencil into the hole of the cassette

364
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,480
and wind the tape,

365
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,382
the recorder doesn't have to be used,

366
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:54,786
to rewind the tape in a short time

367
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:57,188
without damaging the tape that much.

368
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,491
I used to do it a lot when I was a kid too.

369
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:04,596
After pulling a lot of tape out for fun,

370
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:08,499
I rewound the tape by placing a pencil on my lap.

371
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:12,503
Besides, when Officer Sato mentioned checking the tapes,

372
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:16,207
she didn't say it to mean checking on wrinkled tapes.

373
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,009
Like mentioned before,

374
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:21,079
blood was on the base of the left ring finger,

375
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,580
where he wore the ring.

376
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,882
However, for some reason,

377
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,884
there was no blood on one part.

378
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,386
Therefore, among the tapes that you have,

379
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,488
there should be one that was used

380
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,891
to tightrope across the locked room

381
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,594
with Mr. Moroguchi's blood on it.

382
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,296
Mr. Dejima.

383
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:41,099
Don't tell me that you killed him because of Akiba...

384
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,003
Tightrope...

385
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:47,405
Akiba used to tell me too,

386
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,908
that getting along with Mr. Moroguchi

387
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,478
was always like walking on a tightrope.

388
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,380
Tightrope?

389
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,483
Akiba used to be a quiet man,

390
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,285
but ever since he became in charge of Mr. Moroguchi,

391
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:03,888
he always had bandages around him somewhere.

392
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:06,291
What do you think it was?

393
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,692
He was trying out

394
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:09,694
something that Mr. Moroguchi told him to try.

395
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:12,397
He was testing whether the murder trick

396
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,998
that Mr. Moroguchi thought up would really work,

397
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,401
using his own body.

398
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:18,903
Of course, he was very careful

399
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:21,506
so as not to really die doing it.

400
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:24,108
Hey, then don't tell me that you...

401
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,779
That thing about Akiba dying in a locked room...

402
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,380
I found it when I was cleaning out

403
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,783
Akiba's desk at the company.

404
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,785
"Mr. Moroguchi's Trick Note"

405
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,088
A notebook with the exact method of dying

406
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,690
that Akiba died of!

407
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,293
Then, why didn't you submit it to the police?

408
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,995
No use.

409
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:45,596
Mr. Moroguchi would probably say

410
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:49,701
Akiba did it of his own free will, even if he were questioned.

411
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:52,403
But it was an accident, wasn't it?

412
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:57,008
Mr. Moroguchi said the following at another interview.

413
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:58,509
At this age,

414
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,778
I'm finally beginning to understand

415
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,580
the feeling of a murderer.

416
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,982
Nothing can be more delightful than this

417
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,684
for a detective story writer.

418
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,086
That's what he said.

419
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:11,489
So that's when I was convinced

420
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,393
that what Mr. Moroguchi wanted to know using Akiba

421
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,795
was not reality

422
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:21,299
but rather, the mentality of a killer.

423
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,789
Well, something's been bothering me for quite some time.

424
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,691
What is it?

425
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,393
What do you mean what is it?

426
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:57,795
What's this thing about tightrope with me?

427
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,197
Just what does that mean?

428
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,200
Well, that's... You see...

429
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,601
The ring!

430
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,704
Officer Sato, you say that you don't like jewelry

431
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,105
and yet you're wearing a ring.

432
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,008
Officer Takagi wants to know why.

433
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:14,278
Maybe I should've come along with Pops by train.

434
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,485
You mean this good luck charm to keep away evil?

435
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,386
-Good luck charm? -Good luck charm?

436
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:23,988
That's all?

437
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:26,090
Just what do you mean?

438
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,392
Silver and turquoise.

439
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,995
Wearing this on the left ring finger,

440
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,097
keeps bad luck and bugs away from me,

441
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:34,098
so I get to kill two birds with one stone.

442
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:37,502
That's what Yumi told me, so I decided to get one too!

443
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:42,607
Because, you see, I'm cursed and hate bugs too.

444
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:46,477
Well, I don't think Yumi was really talking about bugs.

445
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,379
If... if so...

446
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:50,081
Officer Sato!

447
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:54,085
Please wear my ring on your left ring finger!

448
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,789
Okay.

449
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,694
Oh, boy, am I in trouble?

450
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:07,098
I'll bet I'm going to get it from everybody today.

451
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:10,601
I mean, after all, Officer Sato's going to be wearing my ring

452
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:14,005
on her left ring finger.

453
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,606
"First Investigation Division"

454
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:18,209
I guess I'll act upright

455
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:20,077
and be a man today.

456
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,982
Takagi!

457
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:27,285
I heard about Officer Sato's ring.

458
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:28,786
Here it comes.

459
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:30,988
That ring...

460
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:34,091
was a lucky charm to keep away evil, right?

461
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:36,294
Why does everybody know about it?

462
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:37,795
Don't worry about it.

463
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,497
No big deal!

464
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:41,999
But to think she didn't know what it meant

465
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,302
to wear a ring on her left ring finger...

466
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:47,805
Her being naive makes her even more attractive.

467
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:50,808
Come to think of it, I didn't tell her

468
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:53,077
what that ring means yet.

469
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:54,579
Oh, well...

470
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:47,698
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,600
"Take-out delivery service".

472
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,602
In the next episode, a famous person will appear.

473
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,205
A friend of ours is a celebrity!
