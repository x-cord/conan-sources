Welcome to

2
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,350
A falcon? No, is it an eagle?

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,490
It's a hawk.

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,200
It's a raptor called a Harris's hawk.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,260
Move.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,890
Your eyes are like mine.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,930
They're sharp.

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,980
You'll stress out the hawk
if you point or wave at him!

Falconer
You'll stress out the hawk
if you point or wave at him!

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,610
Hawks are delicate creatures!

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,820
Be careful!

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,570
S-Sorry.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,130
Your fault for showing off, old man.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,710
Find the question that solves the mystery!

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,790
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

16

A traditional-style home
café holds a falconry event.

17
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,310
Determine the trick using your keen eyes.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,050
Always determining the one truth

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,810
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,220
his name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:54,841

Ishima Masahiko (50)

31
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:23,831
You're lucky. You have the whole
place to yourselves today.

32
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:25,831
I see.

33
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,311
Here's your tea.

It's quiet today, but this place

37
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:40,001
Allow me to introduce Takehara Genichi.

38
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,811
He quit his office job to open
a traditional-style home café,

Takehara Genichi (37)

42
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:53,361
Serene and beautiful mountain villages have
the mysterious ability to soothe people's hearts.

43
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:58,011
I began this event because I wanted
more people to learn about that.

44
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:00,801
I see.

45
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:04,571
Experiencing an event while surrounded
by nature does seem like it would

46
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,371
produce memories a little
different from one's everyday life.

47
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,461
I'm going to the bathroom.

48
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:11,131
Okay.

49
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,531
I told you not to come here.

50
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:19,511
I'm sorry. I forgot to get
your signature in one spot.

51
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,391
You haven't told anyone?

52
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:29,511
I told my wife.

53
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,911
There's no need to tell anyone else.

54
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,281
They'd probably kill me if I did.

55
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:38,061
Here. How's this?

56
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,281
Good, thank you.

57
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,291
That wasn't a customer?

58
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,711
No. Apparently he was lost.

59
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:51,281
I see.

60
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:56,301
Honey, could we get some boar?

61
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,511
Sure.

62
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,311
Boar?

63
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,641
Do you like Botan stew?

64
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:04,841
Botan stew? I love Botan stew.

65
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:09,831
Oh, Botan stew is made with boar meat.

66
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:13,281
I hope I'm able to catch one.

67
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,351
I look forward to it.

68
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:21,771
Is something wrong?

69
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,611
No.

70
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,511
Oh, I know.

71
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,961
Wow, this is amazing.

72
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,431
I made it myself.

73
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:39,591
Really? Wait, did you make everything here?

74
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:46,161
Yeah. I made all the animals in the café.

75
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,991
When my husband quit his office job,

76
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:52,201
he asked me to open this café with him,

77
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,891
so I quit my office job, too.

78
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:58,321
But this was my only skill,

79
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,861
so I made these while running the café.

80
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,071
These animals are the physical
representation of the experience

81
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:07,491
and memories I made working at this café.

82
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,951
I'll be back.

83
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,781
Be careful.

84
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,631
I know.

85
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,131
See you later.

86
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:23,101
Good luck with your hunt.

87
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:24,271
Thank you.

Puffed rice complete
Okuho Mountain Village Festival

89
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,771
This rice came from my fields.

90
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:34,051
Let's feed this into the machine.

91
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,651
Then we close the lid, light the fire,

92
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:43,781
and turn it while waiting
for the pressure to rise.

93
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:48,161
I used to go into the
city to sell puffed rice.

94
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,831
Tons of kids around your age would gather.

95
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,011
It was a lot of fun.

96
00:06:54,441 --> 00:07:00,171
But now I'm the only one in this
area who makes puffed rice.

97
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:04,431
The other farmers who grew
rice quit farming, too.

98
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:11,181
So I'm grateful to Genichi-san for allowing
me to make puffed rice at this café.

99
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,411
I'm truly grateful.

100
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,481
Once the pressure is high enough,

101
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,691
we close the lid so the puffed
rice doesn't go flying.

102
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,911
Right on time.

103
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:25,701
Okay, then.

104
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,071
Here we go.

105
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,001
What's wrong?

106
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,711
You look like a dove that's
been shot by a pea shooter.

107
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,631
It was a bit loud.

108
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,561
Actually, I think I just heard a gunshot.

109
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:58,061
Finally, we coat the rice with
sugar water and mix well.

110
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,181
And it's done.

111
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,531
Eat up.

112
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,071
Delicious!

113
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,091
Is that her husband?

114
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,381
Hey!

115
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:17,081
Bring us a nice juicy boar!

116
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,301
Be careful!

119
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:35,121
You're okay. Try to relax.

120
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:38,541
Hawks can sense your nervousness.

121
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,261
Don't be scared.

122
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:41,811
Okay.

123
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:44,321
Now pick up the food.

124
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:45,371
Okay.

125
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,551
Here we go.

126
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,221
I did it. I did it, Conan-kun.

127
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,411
That's amazing, Ran-neechan.

128
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,661
Conan-kun, you're next. Give it a shot.

129
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:10,381
What?

130
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,711
Thank you.

131
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,391
No problem.

132
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,601
You're scared of hawks, huh?

133
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:17,271
What?

134
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,621
Oh, nothing.

135
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,401
I like birds.

136
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:25,451
Among them, raptors are my
favorite, especially hawks.

137
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:28,211
That's why I started this job.

138
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:33,681
Things are quiet now, but lots
of people used to come before.

139
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,791
It was fun and felt worthwhile.

140
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:42,171
I'm hoping to liven up this place
with this guy like we used to.

141
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:48,421
So if you could promote
today's event at school,

142
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,371
I'd appreciate it.

143
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:51,771
Okay.

144
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,051
Of course.

145
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,351
Dad, why don't you try it?

146
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:04,031
Huh? I'm not interested.

147
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:06,721
It's because he got yelled at earlier.

148
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:10,041
This concludes the falconry show.

149
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,801
Botan stew is next.

150
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,741
Now this is what I've been waiting for!

151
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,241
Not yet.

152
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,291
You haven't done that yet, have you?

153
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,791
What haven't we done?

154
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,791
The main event of our café's
Okuho Mountain Village Festival.

155
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,101
We send the hawk to the target over there.

156
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:40,181
There's a lure with rabbit fur and meat
hanging in a clearing on that mountain.

157
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:43,411
We have him fly all the way there.

158
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:46,191
Seems pretty far. Can he do that?

159
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,471
Yeah, just watch.

160
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:10,341
Is that my husband?

161
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,061
What was that?

162
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,221
Conan-kun!

163
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:14,591
Dad!

164
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:21,021
Sir. Sir!

165
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,811
Excuse me.

166
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:32,321
Unfortunately... Ran, call the police.

167
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:33,821
Got it.

168
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,871
No. Honey...

169
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,991
Honey!

170
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:50,211
Was it accidentally fired?

171
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:56,221
So, Mori-kun, you're saying
it was an accident?

172
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,071
Yes.

173
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:02,891
The victim Takehara Genichi-san was
inside the thicket with a shotgun.

174
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,591
The hawk attacked him in there.

175
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:11,331
Genichi-san fired his shotgun
in an attempt to defend himself.

176
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:16,241
However, the shell unfortunately
struck Genichi-san himself.

177
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:17,571
That's not possible!

178
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,701
A hawk would never attack a person.

179
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,321
Hawks are afraid of people.

180
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:28,081
Not just hawks. Most animals are.

181
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,911
But what if a gun were pointed at it?

182
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:35,321
You said just pointing at a hawk
with your finger is a bad idea.

183
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,841
I did say that, but...

184
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,941
I thought I saw something shining around here

185
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:44,351
when the hawk changed direction.

186
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,901
Shining?

187
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:49,731
Pardon me. Did you find anything
around here that shines?

188
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,631
No, nothing.

189
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:53,231
Not particularly.

190
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:57,751
Perhaps it was the sunlight
reflecting off his shotgun.

191
00:12:57,751 --> 00:13:02,581
But, Mori-kun, unlike other guns,
shotguns have long barrels.

192
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:06,441
Is it possible for someone to accidentally
shoot themselves with one?

193
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:09,251
I think this is an exceptional case.

194
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:13,481
He probably held the gun
like this, then this,

195
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,391
and from here, like this.

196
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,261
And finally, this.

197
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,891
Mori-kun...

198
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:21,071
Dad.

199
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:24,011
Ran, how's the wife doing?

200
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:28,521
She seems okay, but there's no
telling how she really feels.

201
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,181
I see.

202
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,418
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:06,418
I know Genichi-san won't come back
no matter how much I apologize.

204
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:09,758
But I'm really sorry.

205
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,998
Don't worry about it, Akashiba-kun.

206
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,298
It was an accident.

207
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:16,118
It's not your fault.

208
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:19,688
Don't blame yourself or your hawk.

209
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:20,988
But...

210
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:24,168
Akashiba-kun, listen to her.

211
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:27,438
She's having the hardest
time dealing with this.

212
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:29,358
A-All right.

213
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:33,618
This is probably the last
year we'll hold this event.

214
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:34,538
Nobody will come after this.

215
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,998
No! We have to keep going.

216
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:41,278
My husband won't be able to
rest in peace if we stop now.

217
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,098
Wait.

218
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:05,978
What are you doing?

219
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:06,608
What?

220
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,168
You're not going to kill your hawk, are you?

221
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:11,238
I wouldn't do that.

222
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:15,408
I started this job because I love hawks.

223
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,928
No falconer would kill his own hawk.

224
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,438
Then what's that medicine?

225
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:22,458
Oh, this?

226
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:26,168
It's for his injured foot.

227
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:28,598
I see.

228
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,628
How was he injured?

229
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,228
I don't know.

230
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:36,228
But ankle injuries can be fatal to hawks.

231
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,008
I'm glad it wasn't serious.

232
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:41,888
When do hawks injure their ankles?

233
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,468
There can be a lot of causes,

234
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:48,758
like getting caught in crow
guards or fishing line.

235
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,918
These two were stuck together.

236
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:04,078
Okay. I know the approximate shape.

237
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:07,788
What's this?

238
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,208
Yahoo!

239
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:16,278
Yahoo!

240
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:34,208
You made all of these, right?

241
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,618
I'm glad you like them.

242
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:38,228
You're quite dexterous.

243
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:40,278
I'm good at woodworking.

244
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,238
Have some tea.

245
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,538
Thank you.

246
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,988
Inspector Megure, we're ready to leave.

247
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:52,798
Got it.

248
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:56,298
I guess we'll get going, too.

249
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:05,598
I thought we were leaving...

250
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,278
Mori-kun, could it be?

251
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,048
Inspector, could you gather everyone?

252
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,288
I have something important to discuss.

253
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,358
Takagi-kun.

254
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,108
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,618
What important thing did you want to discuss?

256
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:26,748
Genichi-san didn't die in an accident.

257
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,248
He what?

258
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:32,498
A device was used to disguise
his death as an accident.

259
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,758
What device?

260
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:39,258
There was fishing line strung
up where the husband died.

261
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:43,888
The hawk flew off course because
its feet got caught on it.

262
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:50,908
But, Mori-san, we didn't find
any fishing line at the scene.

263
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:53,208
It was at the bottom of a nearby
ravine, wrapped around a wooden drum.

264
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:56,398
The culprit must've wrapped the
fishing line around the drum

265
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:03,908
and dropped it down the ravine so it
wouldn't remain at the crime scene.

266
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:06,788
But what was the fishing line for?

267
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,738
To fire a shotgun.

268
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,788
The thread was tied to a
shotgun set up in the thicket.

269
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:17,548
The thread was drawn in
front of the hawk's target.

270
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:20,928
When the hawk's feet got caught in the line,

271
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,538
it pulled the trigger on the shotgun,

272
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,178
firing a shell.

273
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:32,698
That shell pierced the fastener on the
device supporting Genichi-san's body.

274
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,748
With the fastener gone, it began to move.

275
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:43,488
It pushed Genichi-san's body out of the thicket,
while the device itself fell down the ravine.

276
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:48,368
The shotgun was also dragged down by the
fishing line and left at the crime scene.

277
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:51,968
But Mori-san, why did the
culprit set up that device?

278
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,848
To create an alibi.

279
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:57,798
Genichi-san was murdered before then.

280
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,508
When was that?

281
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:02,008
When the puffed rice was made.

282
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:05,508
The events of this festival
occur at fixed times.

283
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:10,518
Ishima-san, who is in charge of the puffed
rice demonstration, was exactly on schedule.

284
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:19,318
The culprit knew this and killed the husband
as the puffed rice machine made a loud noise.

285
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:25,028
At that time, I thought I heard a gunshot
in what I believed to be an echo.

286
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,038
Bring us a nice juicy boar!

287
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:35,788
But there was no echo when I shouted to
the person I thought was the husband.

288
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:40,208
Then who waved to us then?

289
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:41,668
The culprit.

290
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:49,848
And the person absent at
that time was you, ma'am.

291
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:50,698
What?

292
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:51,848
Me?

293
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:55,568
You thought you could disguise the gunshot

294
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:59,358
if you shot him during the puffed
rice demonstration, didn't you?

295
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,238
Do you have any proof?

296
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:03,578
Indeed I do.

297
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:06,988
It's that red stain on your neck.

298
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:14,098
There's was a bloodstain on the
same spot on your husband's body.

299
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,268
The blood was also on your
husband's hunting jacket.

300
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:24,378
It probably stained the
same spot when you wore it.

301
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,138
Do you have more excuses?

302
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:34,888
No. I did it.

303
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:37,898
Could you tell us why?

304
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:42,648
He was trying to sell this place.

305
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:45,258
How's this?

306
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,528
Good. That seals our sale agreement.

307
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:51,408
Yeah.

308
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:54,468
I should get going.

309
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,038
Honey.

310
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:59,168
I'm selling this place and starting over.

311
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:00,558
We can't!

312
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,908
We built this place together.

313
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,428
And the others...

314
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,528
Shut up!

315
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:06,858
Don't talk back to me!

316
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:09,178
Fine.

317
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:13,428
I'll pack the animals and our things.

318
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,758
What are you talking about?

319
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:20,058
I'm leaving you and the café.

320
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:22,098
Don't get the wrong idea.

321
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:25,658
Both you and this café are a burden to me.

322
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:31,838
I didn't think he was like that.

323
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:36,828
I thought if I killed that man using the
mountain village's power that he mocked,

324
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,828
then that poor hawk who
was simply used for profit

325
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:43,238
would be repaid in some way.

326
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:51,978
Ma'am, you can tell us
about it at the station.

327
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,968
Come with us, please.

328
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:30,608
Exterminating crows is an
important job falconers perform.

329
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,318
All right!

330
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:34,488
Dad?

331
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:39,308
Hawk!

332
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:50,078
Hawks don't attack people,
but crows do, so be careful.

333
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:51,498
Okay.

334
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,428
Should've left them alone!
