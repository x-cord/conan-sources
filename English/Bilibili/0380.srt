1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,440
Today's deduction is really shocking.

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,040
So complicated and calculated like an art.

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,740
Find the answer in the snow.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,240
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,825 --> 00:02:01,725
"The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 2)"

8
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:07,325
Asuka went to the outdoor bath around 10pm.

9
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:11,725
And Ema went to the shrine in the garden around 10.30pm.

10
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,625
These two victims were killed with the votive dagger.

11
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,925
As this murder weapon was found in the outdoor bath,

12
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:22,625
it is plausible to think that Ema was killed first.

13
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:28,025
Plus, there were no footprints outside the shrine in the garden.

14
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:32,025
One must pass the recreation hall in order to get to the outdoor bath,

15
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,625
but nobody was seen passing there after 10.30pm.

16
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,825
Oh, my.

17
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,525
So these killings were done in the inaccessible spaces.

18
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,525
It's the Kimono visit!

19
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:43,225
It was Sakurako who revenged herself on these girls with the Kimono Visit!

20
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:46,725
Sakurako? Who is that person?

21
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:53,025
She's my university friend who committed suicide

22
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:55,325
because they framed her up for selling illegal drugs.

23
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:59,025
You mean Asuka and Ema did it?

24
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,225
Yes!

25
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:04,225
So, it was... it was her revenge.

26
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,625
Lieutenant Masaki.

27
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:11,725
In the shrine, we found one of the earrings of the victim missing.

28
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,525
Here. This is the one.

29
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,725
That's an expensive one.

30
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:21,625
That earring probably costs at least 200,000 yen.

31
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,425
400,000 yen as a pair?

32
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:28,825
It's expensive, but it's not enough motive to kill.

33
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,525
True.

34
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:31,725
I remember.

35
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:35,325
You were wearing a necklace of the same brand, weren't you?

36
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:40,625
Yes. But I took them off because Ema complained about it.

37
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,325
Yes. We found this in Ema's jacket.

38
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:50,525
We also found that the kimonos and the sashes at the homicide scenes

39
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:53,425
actually came from the closet, which was not locked at all.

40
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,325
So anybody could take them out.

41
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:59,325
Perhaps the murderer must have hidden them somewhere beforehand.

42
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:03,325
Okay, everyone. Could I ask you what you were doing last night?

43
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,925
Firstly, Eri.

44
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:09,425
You went to the outdoor bath around 9.30pm and came out around 10.00pm.

45
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,225
And Asuka just came in as you left.

46
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:16,225
Right. After that, I went back to my room.

47
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:19,225
I saw Mr. Mouri on the way and we had a little chat.

48
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,025
We did. Actually, you looked great and...

49
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,825
And Yoriko, you were working on some stuff on the coverage.

50
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,025
So I suppose you saw Eri?

51
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:36,025
Yes, I did. I saw Eri.

52
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,725
And after five minutes or so, I saw Ema going to the backdoor.

53
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,825
So that was around 10.30pm, right?

54
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,625
Did you see anybody else heading there?

55
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:49,925
No, I don't think so.

56
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:53,925
Around that time, Mr. Mouri and the other three went to the outdoor bath.

57
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:56,725
But there was a reserved sign on the door of the female bathroom.

58
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:59,425
The door was locked.

59
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,425
So both of you went back to the recreation room.

60
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:02,925
That's right.

61
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,425
Mr. Mouri.

62
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,625
Did you hear or see something unusual when you were in outdoor bath?

63
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,225
We did.

64
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:13,225
We heard a swash from the female bathroom.

65
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:16,325
When was it? Around what time?

66
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:19,025
I think it was around 10.50pm.

67
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,925
Maybe that was when the killing occurred.

68
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,625
We only heard the swash. We didn't hear a scream.

69
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,625
Isn't it strange?

70
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:32,925
Maybe the murderer stunned the victim with stun gun before she screamed.

71
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,725
Really?

72
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,325
It must be!

73
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:39,825
Kid, keep out of the investigation.

74
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,225
So Ran and Harumi,

75
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:45,525
you girls were just playing ping pong in the recreation hall?

76
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:51,325
No. I actually went back to my room to take off my contact lenses.

77
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:53,625
Just for 10 minutes or so.

78
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,925
All right.

79
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:58,625
So nobody passed through the recreation hall while Harumi was away.

80
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,325
Right.

81
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,225
It was around 11pm when Mr. Mouri got out of the bath.

82
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:07,225
Around that time, Eri and Yoriko were having a meeting here.

83
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,225
Where were you at that time, Mr. Bando?

84
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:13,025
I joined the meeting around 11.15pm.

85
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:19,325
And then, Mr. Mouri found Asuka's dead body in the outdoor bath.

86
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,425
Speaking of the paper doll of Kimono Demon,

87
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:24,425
wasn't it there when you first came to the bathroom?

88
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,625
No. I'm sure it wasn't.

89
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,425
After Asuka was found, Ema was found dead in the shrine in the garden.

90
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,925
Why did she go to the shrine?

91
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,025
That's a good question.

92
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,525
Here's the answer.

93
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:40,625
"Ema. There's something I would like to discuss with you in person.

94
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,925
I will be waiting inside the shrine in the garden. Bando."

95
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:48,925
This is ridiculous! I did not write that letter!

96
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:52,925
But in fact, we don't know where you really were until 11.15pm.

97
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:58,425
But what's the motive? Why would I kill them?

98
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,725
Speaking of motive,

99
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,525
I think Harumi is the only person who might have had the motive to kill.

100
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:04,225
No, I don't.

101
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,225
I know you hate the victims

102
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,125
because of what happened to your friend Sakurako.

103
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,925
Besides, you went back to your room to take off your contact lenses.

104
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,525
During that period, you don't have an alibi.

105
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:15,825
No, I didn't kill them!

106
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,525
Whoever is the murderer,

107
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:20,925
we have to find out how these killings happened in the closed space first.

108
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:24,225
If the victims were killed with different weapons,

109
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,925
a possibility of what could've happened still stands.

110
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,125
But why did the murderer

111
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:32,025
make it look like the Kimono Demon did it in the first place?

112
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,725
Thanks a lot.

113
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:42,925
We got it.

114
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:45,825
You mean the necropsy report?

115
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,925
Yes. Both victims were killed with the same murder weapon,

116
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,425
the votive dagger.

117
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,925
I see.

118
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:54,425
The same murder weapon? Now, we are stuck.

119
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,825
So the murder weapons were the same.

120
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:02,125
The bloodstain on the bandana was found to be Ema's blood.

121
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,125
Other than that,

122
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:08,525
the dolls from the scene, the shrine and other areas, and Ema's letter,

123
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,025
we couldn't find any fingerprints or information

124
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,725
that's related to the suspect.

125
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,725
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:19,325
You're welcome, sir. I will now depart.

127
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,525
What are we going to do, Mr. Mouri?

128
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,325
Nothing is found?

129
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:29,025
Next. Yesterday, we were at the Kid Sleighing Contest.

130
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,925
Hey, move! Move!

131
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,625
Looks like fun.

132
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,925
What?

133
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,225
It's the kids. The kids on the TV.

134
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:40,825
Come on! Move!

135
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:41,925
I got it.

136
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,325
That's what it was.

137
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,625
Now, I understand the trick.

138
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,225
It's about six inches here.

139
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,725
And here,

140
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:27,025
it's about three inches under the snow.

141
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,625
Six inches and three inches.

142
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,325
But why her?

143
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,825
Conan, where were you?

144
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:43,925
Well...

145
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,125
I just went out for a walk.

146
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,025
Tokyo Hajime?

147
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,025
It's Mr. Bando.

148
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,025
Wait a minute. Maybe that person is...

149
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:59,425
Hey! Why are your socks all wet?

150
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,825
Why don't we take it to the fireplace and dry them?

151
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:03,825
Wait. Hey, Ran! Wait.

152
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:06,025
Now, I know who did it.

153
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,325
It must be that person.

154
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,125
But why?

155
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:18,047
We have to figure out how and when the paper doll was put here,

156
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,647
if we suspect that person as the murderer.

157
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:23,947
What is this?

158
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,847
There was nothing there when we came here last time.

159
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:29,947
It's weird. This thing is kind of cold.

160
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,047
I see.

161
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:47,047
Is this Takagi? It's me, Mouri.

162
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:52,047
Actually, I want you to do some research on a person. Can you do that?

163
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,047
Mr. Ogura!

164
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:57,647
There's something Uncle Kogoro wants you to do.

165
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:00,547
What? Mr. Mouri said it? All right.

166
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:08,747
If I am right, then that person must be the murderer.

167
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:11,847
Mr. Mouri, you told us to come here.

168
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,347
What is it?

169
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:14,947
Of course.

170
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,847
We are going to find out what really happened in this hotel.

171
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,347
So you know who killed the victims?

172
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,247
Who is it?

173
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,047
Let me explain in the order of what happened.

174
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,447
Now first,

175
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:31,747
it's about Ema, who was killed in the closed shrine in the garden.

176
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,147
Lieutenant Masaki,

177
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:37,147
could you please turn on the digital camera that's on the tub?

178
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,747
I've been thinking about the picture of the footprints around the shrine

179
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,747
because there was something that kept bugging me.

180
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:51,547
And this morning, I finally figured out what it was.

181
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:53,747
What's wrong with this picture?

182
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,747
The footprints are not deep enough.

183
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,747
What?

184
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,247
Yesterday afternoon,

185
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,547
when I walked around the shrine in the garden,

186
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:03,747
my feet sank down about three inches in the snow.

187
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:08,347
It kept snowing the rest of the day.

188
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:11,247
Thus, by the time we got to the shrine around 10.30pm,

189
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:18,547
Ema's footprints should have been at least six inches deep or so.

190
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:22,147
However, it was about in fact only four inches.

191
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,947
It was too shallow.

192
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:26,747
I see. But then, why?

193
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,347
Those footprints were pressed from the top.

194
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:31,547
Pressed? From the top?

195
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:32,947
Yes, indeed.

196
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:37,547
Her footprints were found from the backdoor to the shrine.

197
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,947
Ogura and I covered every single one of them with bath towels

198
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,547
in order to preserve them.

199
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:48,247
But what if those bath towels were solid boards or something?

200
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:52,247
You could walk on it and move around the shrine

201
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:55,547
without leaving footprints, right?

202
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:58,447
It's that simple?

203
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,947
It seems that the tricks are always complicated,

204
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,947
but actually they're really not.

205
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,347
The murderer most likely

206
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:07,747
got a couple of wooden boards which are about three feet long

207
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:12,347
and moved around putting those boards on top of Ema's footprints.

208
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:16,947
After killing Ema,

209
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:19,947
this murderer went back to the backdoor doing the same thing.

210
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:23,947
This way, the footprints are maintained as it was before.

211
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:26,447
Except they get bit shallower.

212
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:31,147
But how did the murderer get to the backdoor, Mr. Mouri?

213
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:33,847
Yes! Nobody passed the lobby, right?

214
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,647
The murderer walked under the eaves by using the same method.

215
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:41,147
That's why there're no witnesses or footprints.

216
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:44,647
According to my investigation from this morning,

217
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:45,847
coming out from the back door,

218
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:49,847
the snow on the right side leave footprints about six inches deep.

219
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,447
On the left side, only about three inches deep.

220
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:55,947
Meaning that the murderer came from a room along the left side of the pass.

221
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:59,447
So I checked the left side

222
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:03,347
and found a place where the snow gets deeper again.

223
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:07,947
Where is it?

224
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,347
It was right in front of your room.

225
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,147
Eri Akechi.

226
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,347
No way.

227
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:17,947
Eri did it?

228
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:20,847
Last night,

229
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:23,147
Eri left the outdoor bath as soon Asuka came in

230
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:26,247
and went back to her room.

231
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:27,547
Then, you went up to the shrine from the backdoor

232
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,347
by using the method I explained just now.

233
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:32,047
You gave Ema a fake letter from Mr. Bando beforehand,

234
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:35,747
so she'd come to the shrine, then you killed her.

235
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:40,547
Sure. That way, I could kill Ema.

236
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,247
But it's impossible to kill Asuka, isn't it?

237
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:44,347
That's true.

238
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:48,647
You can't use the same trick in the outdoor bath on the cliff.

239
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:53,247
Plus, nobody passed the recreation hall.

240
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:58,847
The truth is, it was Asuka who was actually killed first.

241
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:05,847
Eri stunned Asuka with a stun gun.

242
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,347
She removed Asuka's clothes and killed her with the votive dagger.

243
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:12,547
Then she threw the dead body in the bathtub with kimono sashes.

244
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:16,547
She probably stole the dagger the night before.

245
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:20,547
It doesn't make sense though. Because Asuka was murdered first,

246
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:25,047
yet the dagger and Ema's bandana were found in the outdoor bath.

247
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:28,347
That's right. That paper doll thing is, too.

248
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:32,347
That was a trick using dry ice.

249
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:35,147
By using a small piece of dry ice,

250
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:38,747
Eri glued the paper doll onto the crack of the ceiling.

251
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,247
If you know how long it lasts,

252
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:45,247
it is possible to drop the paper doll whenever you want to.

253
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:48,047
That's why the paper doll was kind of cold.

254
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,647
Eri asked the general manager to get her a cake everyday

255
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:56,147
because she wanted the dry ice in it.

256
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:59,247
I understand the dry ice trick,

257
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,247
but what about the dagger and bandana?

258
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:04,147
I didn't come to the bathroom.

259
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:08,547
Well, it's possible to move them without coming here.

260
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,947
Let me show you how now.

261
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,647
Yes, I understand.

262
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,447
This is...

263
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:38,047
These boards came down from Eri's room,

264
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,147
which is on the cliff right up there.

265
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:43,047
Now, I want you guys to think.

266
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:46,747
The votive dagger which was used to kill Ema,

267
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:49,447
and the bandana with her blood on it.

268
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,947
This way, you can move these things without leaving the room.

269
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:59,047
Mr. Mouri heard the swashy sound when the boards got into the water.

270
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,247
That's right.

271
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:05,047
Using this trick, Eri tried to disguise the order of the murder,

272
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:08,147
in order to establish her alibi.

273
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:11,347
But the question is, where did the boards go?

274
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:12,647
Right.

275
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:16,047
Here it is, Mr. Mouri.

276
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:18,547
What is that?

277
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:20,847
These were the sashes left in the closet.

278
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,147
They are frozen hard though.

279
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:28,647
A sash becomes like this if you soak and leave it outside for a night.

280
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:32,647
She used the frozen sash to hide her footprints in the snow.

281
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:35,047
I see. When they are put in the water...

282
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:40,047
they just turn into normal sashes.

283
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,747
It would look odd if there were just a dead body

284
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:44,947
and a couple of sashes in the water.

285
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:47,747
Thus, she put some more sashes into the water

286
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:51,247
and spread tons of kimono in the shrine.

287
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:54,047
That way, the murder scene looks more like the folklore of Kimono Demon,

288
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:57,447
which actually hides the secret of the trick.

289
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,147
That's a very clever deduction.

290
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,447
But where is the evidence?

291
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,747
Show me the sole of your foot.

292
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,947
Show me, would you?

293
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:17,747
Please, Eri.

294
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:20,247
All right.

295
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:26,947
I think I stepped on a nail or something.

296
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,247
I don't think so.

297
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,547
You actually stepped on Ema's earring

298
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:33,747
which actually dropped in the middle of the fight.

299
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:40,747
Last night, I told you guys to wait in the hall

300
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:43,647
while we did some on-site investigation.

301
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,247
However, Eri said it was better to sit on a chair rather than on the floor,

302
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,547
so you guys moved to the lobby.

303
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:54,047
Eri, that's because your foot was bleeding, wasn't it?

304
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:58,647
That's why you wouldn't want to take off your slippers in the hall.

305
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,547
Do you have evidence that this a wound I got from the earring?

306
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:04,147
I found the missing earring.

307
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:05,347
Here!

308
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,447
Conan!

309
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,347
This brand name earring is worth 200,000 yen a piece.

310
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:17,147
Nice! If her blood is on it, it will serve as evidence!

311
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:20,247
It's amazing that you found it.

312
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,647
Actually, this is a pendant. I borrowed from Harumi.

313
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,747
Okay. I give up.

314
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,947
I killed Asuka and Ema.

315
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:52,447
Why did you do such a horrible thing, Eri?

316
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,147
Her name is not Eri. It's actually Chieri.

317
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:59,147
She's been hiding her real name.

318
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,747
Your last name, "Ake" is a very rare name.

319
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:06,247
So people think your real name is Akechi Eri, rather than Ake Chieri.

320
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,447
I asked my friend at the Metropolitan Police to do some research on you.

321
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:13,347
Chieri, you are the real sister of Sakurako Suzuka,

322
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,347
who killed herself five years ago, right?

323
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:20,047
What? Eri and Sakurako are sisters?

324
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:23,947
As you sisters lost your parents in a fire,

325
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:28,447
Sakurako was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Suzuka.

326
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:32,947
Okay, I'll tell you the rest.

327
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,047
When my younger sister Sakurako died,

328
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,647
I was in Boston, trying to become a famous writer.

329
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,847
So it was actually a year later when I heard that she killed herself.

330
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:43,647
She was a very naive girl.

331
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,847
And because somebody framed her up selling drugs,

332
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:48,947
she had to kill herself.

333
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,447
Poor Sakurako.

334
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:54,947
How come she didn't tell me about it?

335
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:56,547
I'm her sister.

336
00:20:57,747 --> 00:21:00,947
I'm the only family for her in this world.

337
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:06,147
What Asuka and Ema did to my sister was totally unforgivable.

338
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:09,447
So one day, I came up with the idea of revenge.

339
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,147
I asked my university friend Yoriko

340
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:16,647
to invite Asuka and Ema to this hotel for coverage of a new TV series.

341
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,347
It was a perfect opportunity to take revenge

342
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:21,747
disguised by the folklore of the Kimono Demon.

343
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:25,447
Okay. But do you think Sakurako is happy about it?

344
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:30,147
There was a person among the three interviewees

345
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:34,547
that your sister actually trusted from the bottom of her heart.

346
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:37,247
It was Harumi Fukatsu. If she wasn't here,

347
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:40,947
I wouldn't have known about your sister's death.

348
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:44,947
And therefore, would not have suspected you as the murderer.

349
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:50,347
To me, it just feels like it was Sakurako's will that you two met.

350
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,547
By meeting Harumi, it's most likely

351
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:56,547
that she hoped that you'd stop committing the crime.

352
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,247
Harumi.

353
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:01,747
Maybe you were possessed by the Kimono Demon.

354
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:05,347
But I'm sure this isn't what your sister wants.

355
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:43,247
Huh? Why am I here?

356
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:46,847
This isn't good.

357
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,147
Oh, no!

358
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:53,547
Relax and enjoy your luxury moment in the hot spring.

00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:04,047
See?

361
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:08,747
The murderer didn't know the victim left a dying message.

362
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:12,647
The door of the safe is left wide open.

363
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:16,347
Then we should work on the four staff who found the opened safe.

364
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:18,547
What do you mean?

365
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:23,547
Well, Sleeping Kogoro always stands up for the weak.

366
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:29,547
Next Conan, "The Deduction Battle (Part 1)"

367
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,674
