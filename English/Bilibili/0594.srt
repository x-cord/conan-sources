Hello, I'm Ran Mouri!

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,040
And this is free-loader...

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,640
That's an unnecessary remark.

I'm Conan Edogawa!

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,640
We did not come to Hiroshima

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,740

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,540

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,640
What's the matter?

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm sorry,

21

Really?

35
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,340
Really! Really!

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,640
You didn't seem amateurish at all!

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,740
Oh, yeah?

38
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,440
So, we were on a visit to Hiroshima

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,540
as guests in a travel program

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,640
to be aired on Nichiuri TV.

55
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:09,846
Hi, Ran!

56
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:11,846
What's the matter, Sonoko?

57
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:14,446
You said that you were going to join us here and yet...

58
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,446
I mean, are you still at home?

59
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,446
Well, you see,

60
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,946
I can't decide on what clothes to wear.

61
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:21,946
I wonder if I should wear

62
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:23,946
a maple patterned one-piece because it suits autumn?

63
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:27,446
Or, should I wear something more grown up like this one?

64
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:30,246
I think both of them look good on you.

65
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:33,546
We went out of our way to say that she was a relative of ours

66
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:37,546
because she insisted on going on air with us and yet...

67
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,246
Sorry to keep you waiting!

68
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:44,046
How is Mr. Kitamura?

69
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:47,046
We're sorry to have caused you worry.

70
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:50,046
We got him to take some medicine for now,

71
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:53,546
so I think that if he rests today, he'll be fine!

72
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:56,646
Let's continue filming!

73
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,346
All right.

74
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,946
What's up, Ran?

75
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:04,046
I guess we're leaving soon, so I'd better hang up.

76
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,046
Hurry over, okay?

77
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,746

My, the work of a producer sure isn't easy, is it?

80
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,946
You have to come along each time to the site.

81
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:21,146
No, no, I don't come along all the time.

82
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,046
He came along this time

83

because our guest is the Sleeping Kogoro!

Yeah, I guess you could say so.

It's an honor.

on the Sanyo main line from Hiroshima Station

89
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,646
to the destination station that is the so-called

90
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,546
entrance of Miyajima, Miyajimaguchi Station.

91

Since Miyajima itself is awed by many

100
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,546
because of its many gods on land,

101
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:17,946
the shrine gates (torii) and shrines are built in the sea.

102

During the low tide,

103
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,046
they say that you can walk over to the Great shrine gate (torii).

104
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:24,746
That's where the dances dedicated to

105
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,646
the gods of the shrines are performed!

Yeah.

121
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:52,246
Gosh. Who the heck put salt in here?

122
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,546
Salt?

123
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,346
Just what do you mean?

124
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,546
I have no idea.

00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:58,646
When we were on air,

126
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,746
I left this drink together with our belongings over there.

127
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:03,446
Maybe it's a prank?

128
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:06,346
Isn't it going a little too far?

129
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:09,146
If I remember correctly,

130
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:11,046
I think Mr. Kamisuwa was near the things.

131
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,546
Hey, hey, cut it out.

132
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:16,346
I wouldn't do such a ridiculous thing like that.

133

That man wearing that coat...

134
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:24,046
Do you know him?

00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,046
No.

00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:30,346

00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:49,246
What were you trying to say a while ago?

145
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:52,946
Yeah. If I remember correctly, from about 2 weeks ago,

146
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:57,646
there's a guy that's been asking around about us.

147
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:01,846
I thought that the guy I saw a while ago looked like him.

148
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:04,646
That man came all the way from Hiroshima after the crew

149
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:07,446
and put salt into the canned coffee?

150
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,246
What on earth for?

151
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:11,846
Moreover...

152
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,446
Although this is just a rumor,

153
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:18,246
there's talk of a worker at the station

154
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:20,246
managing an illegal casino.

155
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:21,946
Illegal casino?

156
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:26,746
And Mr. Kamisuwa as well as Mr. Koshiji all seemed so tense.

What're the seven wonders of Misen?

169
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,946
It's a legend that's been handed down from the days of old about Misen

170
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,346

that Kobo-Daishi is said to have leaned against, that took root.

00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:32,646
in which the writing of Kobo-Daishi is carved on.

183
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:34,046
The Hyoshigi no Oto (Sound of the Wooden Clappers),

184
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,146
the sound of wooded clappers sounded

185
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,046
by the goblin that resides in Misen.

186
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:39,646
The Shidare Zakura (Dewy Cherry Blossoms)

187
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,146
that looks wet even on clear days with no rain.

188
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,846
The Ryuto no Sugi (Dragon Fire Cedar),

189
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:48,546
a mysterious light that appears in the sea of Miyajima

190
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:51,446
that can be seen from the mountain top of Misen.

191
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:55,346
These maple buns are of assorted flavours

192
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,346
that symbolize the 7 wonders of what I just mentioned.

193
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,846
I see.

194
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,846
This tastes like plum.

195
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:05,246
That's the Tin Staff Plum.

196
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:08,746
This is sakura sweet bean paste.

197
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,246
Dewy Cherry Blossom!

198
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,746
Inextinguishable Fire is a bit spicy hot!

199
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,046
Interesting!

200
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,946
Cut! Okay!

201
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:20,146
You're both pretty good!

202
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,046
Wow, Conan!

203
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,646
You may just be able to debut as a child star!

204
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:27,546
I've been playing the role of a child for quite a while already.

205
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:35,146
What's this?

206
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,246
My, how nostalgic!

207
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,246
-Have you been here before? -Yes.

208
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:42,346
I think it was in autumn two years ago.

209
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:45,146
I came here on an interview for a different TV program.

210
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,446
Long time no see.

211
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:50,546
I heard that you were coming again, so I couldn't wait

212
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:53,946
and had it on display from 2 weeks ago.

213
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:58,446
This guy's... The one I saw a while ago!

214
00:11:58,446 --> 00:11:59,846
Huh?

215
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:01,546
See, this guy!

216
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,846
"Shinroku Ayase (27)" -Isn't he the guy we saw a while ago?

217
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:06,646
Huh? Do you know my older brother?

218
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,746
Your older brother, Yayoi?

219
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,546
Your older brother's whereabouts

220
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,646
have been unknown since 2 weeks ago?

221
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:19,946
Yes. In fact, in autumn two years ago,

222
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:23,546
my parents entered the no trespassing area of Misen,

223
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:27,146
slipped and fell to their death.

224
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:33,146
But my older brother and I had doubts about their death.

225
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:35,146
That our parents who were used to Misen

226
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,146
wouldn't have fallen to their death.

227
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:41,346
My older brother investigated the area thoroughly

228
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:44,746
and found "it".

229
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:46,346
What's the "it"?

230
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:50,046
A glittering pretty accessory-like thing,

231
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,646
shaped like a flower.

232
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,146
About a half a month ago,

233
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:56,446
he said that he found out the identity of it,

234
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,146
and left home.

235
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:00,746
I haven't seen him since and can't get a hold of him either.

236
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,946
Mr. Mouri, I beg of you!

237
00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:05,246
Could you please find my older brother?

238
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,446
Oh, yes.

239
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:10,446
I'm sorry, but we're pressed for time filming.

240
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:12,546
I see.

241
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,546
Why would your older brother

242
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:18,046
want to hang around the crew of Nichiuri TV?

243
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:21,446
Wait a sec. In autumn two years ago...

244
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:22,446
If I remember correctly,

245
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:26,246
Mr. Koshiji and the others were here in Miyajima.

246
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:28,146
Maybe this is connected with the accident

247
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:29,646
that happened here 2 years ago.

248
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:34,746
"Senjokaku"

249
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:40,346
Strange.

250
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,546
What's wrong?

251
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:44,346
Well, it's a call from Miyake,

252
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:48,746
but I don't remember setting such a strange ringtone.

253
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,446
Is this the sound of wooden clappers?

254
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,846
Why don't you try answering?

255
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,746
Okay.

256
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:59,746
Hello, Miyake?

257
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:03,646
What's up? Answer me.

258
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:05,346
Hello?

259
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,646
Where on earth is Ms. Miyake?

260
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:17,846
Time wise I don't think she is somewhere too far.

261
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,746
Ms. Miyake! Are you all right?

262
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:27,046
I'm glad, she's not all that badly hurt.

263
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,046
This is...

264
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,751
Are you all right?

265
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,951
Yes, it's no big deal.

266
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,051
Why were you in a place like that?

267
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,651
That person...

268
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,851
I saw somebody that resembled Yayoi's older brother, so I...

269
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,151
What? My older brother?

270
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:54,551
I went after him,

271
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:57,651
and suddenly the stone from a stone fence came falling...

272
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,651
Putting salt in canned coffee is not that serious,

273
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,051
but this is going a bit too far.

274
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,151
It's the same, isn't it?

275
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,351
-With the seven wonders. -Huh?

276
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:09,551
Audio man Mr. Yatsukawa's coffee

277
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:11,951
was spoiled with salt poured into it.

278
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,251
The sound of wooden clappers that was set as the ringtone

279
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:18,651
before he noticed anything had been changed.

280
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,051
The thing that hurt Ms. Miyake, in charge of make-up

281
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,351
was a blotched stone.

282
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:26,351
They are each objects of the 7 Wonders of Misen.

283
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,951
The Ebb and Flow Rock,

284
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,851
the sound of the wooden clappers,

285
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:32,451
and the Mandala Rock. Don't they all match?

286
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:33,651
True!

287
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:37,151
It's amazing that you noticed, sonny!

288
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,251
Stay out of it, kid.

289
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,151
That's only three out of seven!

290
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:43,251
It's just a coincidence, understand? A coincidence!

291
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,351
I wonder about that. There could be more.

292
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,751
They are!

293
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:51,851
Assistant Producer, Mr. Kitayama's necktie,

294
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,351
the pattern on it is the Dewy Cherry Blossoms, right?

295
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:55,851
Now that you mentioned it.

296
00:15:55,851 --> 00:16:00,151
Yeah, it was of bad taste that was out of season.

297
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:02,351
One more of the 7 Wonders,

298
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:04,051
Dewy Cherry Blossoms!

299
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,751
Then, maybe...

300
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,251
And his stomachache...

301
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,551
It could've been caused by somebody too?

302
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,351
By somebody...

303
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,951
Do you mean Yayoi's older brother?

304
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,851
Oh, no.

305
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,651
If so, but why us?

306
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:23,251
You have no idea as to why?

307
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,551
Maybe you should also go ask Mr. Kitamura?

308
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,251
I know.

309
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:31,151
Mr. Kamisuwa.

310
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,051
He's not answering.

311
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:42,051
I wonder if he's sleeping?

312
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:45,051
Just to be safe, let's have the hotel staff go check on him.

313
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:53,651
I see. So he's asleep after all.

314
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,951
Then, please leave him a message to call us when he gets up.

315
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:59,751
Thank you so very much.

316
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,251
There are three 7 wonders left.

317
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,151
Is something else going to happen yet?

318
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,651
And, besides that guy...

319
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,651
Is Yayoi's older brother really involved?

320
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,051
Wait a sec.

321
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:16,751
Her older brother disappeared two weeks ago and...

322
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:20,651
That photo was also placed there two weeks ago.

323
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,651
Maybe...

324
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:25,751
Her older brother saw the picture and...

325
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,951
What shall we do, Mr. Kamisuwa?

326
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,451
What's scheduled today?

327
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:33,951
After this, we go over to Daishoin and that's it!

328
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,351
Then, filming is priority.

329
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:39,151
We'll talk about this again tonight or something.

330
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,751
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri,

331
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,451
but I hope that's okay with you.

332
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:44,351
Okay.

333
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,851
Okay, let's move it then!

334
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,051
Yes, sir!

335
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:49,951
"Daishoin"

336
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,551
Cut!

337
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,851
Okay, all done!

338
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:08,951
Thanks for all the work, everyone!

339
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:11,351
We've only got one more scene to go today!

340
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,051
There's something about those two.

341
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,351
I'd better keep my eyes on them.

342
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,851
"Kannon Hall"

343
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,351
Next, is the mental training in the dark

344
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,851
that helps get rid of the sins of this world,

345
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,751
climbing the "Ordination Platform"!

346
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:29,651
Ran, Conan, we're counting on you!

347
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,651
Huh, you mean we're going in here all by ourselves?

348
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,951
I'm not too comfortable with things like this.

349
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:37,151
Rather, this is bad,

350
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,851
because I'm not going to be able to watch those two.

351
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:42,451
Hey, you're a boy, don't be a panty!

352
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,951
Go on, go on!

353
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,851
Give it all you got, Ran!

354
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,251
Come on, inside, inside!

355
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:53,351
Hey, Conan.

356
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:54,951
Don't go without me.

357
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:56,851
Let's go together, Conan.

358
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,851
We're finally outside.

359
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:04,851
That's all for today.

360
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:08,051
We'll see you again tomorrow!

361
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:09,851
Thank you so very much.

362
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,151
Huh? Where are Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji?

363
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:17,951
Somebody, come here!

364
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:19,651
What was that?

365
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:28,451
Mr. Kamisuwa?

366
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,851
Mr. Koshiji!

367
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:36,051
This is...

368
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,751
Mr. Koshiji!

369
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:41,251
He's still breathing.

370
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:44,151
Mr. Yatsukawa, call an ambulance!

371
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,251
Fire... He was there...

372
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,751
What?

373
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,751
Fire? He was there?

374
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,551
Who was there?

375
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,451
-The culprit? -What?

376
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,451
Mr. Koshiji, once more!

377
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:00,451
No good, he passed out.

378
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,751
This is...

379
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,551
The strap of his cell phone is...

380
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,151
the tin staff!

381
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:13,251
A small replica of the Tin Staff Plum, one of the 7 wonders?

382
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,051
Did the culprit drop it?

383
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:17,751
It's him.

384
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,851
Huh?

385
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:23,251
I saw the guy we saw in the afternoon run off beyond.

386
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:25,451
Why didn't you say so sooner?

387
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,751
Don't tell me he's planning to flee on the ferry.

388
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,151
Will I make it?

389
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:51,251
-Excuse me! -I'm sorry!

390
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:00,551
Where's the ferry?

391
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,251
Too late?

392
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:10,251
Hey, that!

393
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:17,251
It's that guy!

394
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:19,451
Darn it! We almost got him!

395
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:23,351
Big trouble! Misenya's on fire!

396
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,151
What?

397
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,651
Fire, the shop, eh?

398
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,351
Somebody! Somebody!

399
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:40,951
-Did you bring water? -Hurry up!

400
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:43,351
-Yayoi! -Are you all right?

401
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:45,051
Yes.

402
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:52,151
Kitamura?

403
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:55,251
Mr. Kamisuwa, I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.

404
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:57,251
This is no time for something like that right now.

405
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,851
Koshiji's been attacked and Misenya's on fire.

406
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,851
Huh? Mr. Koshiji's been attacked?

407
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:03,651
A fire? What's going on?

408
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:06,951
Mr. Kitamura who's resting at a hotel in Hiroshima...

409
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:10,851
Mr. Kamisuwa! This is bad!

410
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:12,151
Just before the fire broke out,

411
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:14,351
the people of the neighborhood seem to have seen

412
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:16,451
someone who resembled her older brother.

413
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,251
What?

414
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:49,751
"Next Episode" -I'm sure that guy's the culprit!

415
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:52,051
You mean her older brother...

416
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:54,751
He attacked Mr. Koshiji and set fire to his own house?

417
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,851
"Renown Detective of Gourmet Tour Solves the Case!"

00:23:57,851 --> 00:23:59,551

419
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:02,251
Yayoi?

420
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:05,851
We may be attacked again too, you know.

421
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:09,251
I'm not letting the culprit do as he wants to anymore!

422
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:11,651
Now, it's our turn!!

423
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,751

428

Dad, what about the case?

429
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:25,778
Just get me beer first of all!

430
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:26,882
Hey, hey.
