1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.040
At Sera's invitation,

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.540
Ran, Sonoko, and I came to a rental villa deep in the mountains.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.340
Fifteen years ago,

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.240
a tragic crime was committed in the vicinity of the villa,

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.540
by a killer called The Red Woman.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040
Sera had come in place of her older brother

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.440
to solve the weird phenomena occurring frequently

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.740
that have to do with the color red.

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.040
In the midst of all this...

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.940
Hey, what's this?

11
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.740
-Don't tell me? -Don't tell me?

12
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.040
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

13
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.740
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

14
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.040
Is it fantasy or reality?

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.940
The silhouette of The Red Woman that even Sonoko saw!

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.940
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:55.227
"The Tragedy of The Red Woman (Evil Spirit)"

20
00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:03.627
Oh, thank you for coming.

21
00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:04.727
How is it?

22
00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:06.227
Yes, ma'am.

23
00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:11.027
The victim is Mr. Masaie Hakuya, age 28.

24
00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:14.027
He came with a few of his friends to this villa using his holiday leave.

25
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.827
They were all planning to spend a few days here.

26
00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:21.527
Mr. Hakuya seems to have arrived at this rental villa in late afternoon.

27
00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:25.527
After eating lunch, he split chores with his friends to clean the villa.

28
00:03:25.527 --> 00:03:29.427
That's when he was killed.

29
00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:33.327
After that, his friends who went to take a bath

30
00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:37.127
seem to have found him sunk in the tub.

31
00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:39.427
I see.

32
00:03:40.727 --> 00:03:44.427
By the way, was the blood in the bath room the victim's?

33
00:03:44.427 --> 00:03:46.027
Oh, no.

34
00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:50.027
It was the blood of the boy who had come to this rental villa.

35
00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:51.227
Boy?

36
00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:54.227
Yes. That boy over there.

37
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.127
You people.

38
00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:00.827
Rather, Conan, what's the matter?

39
00:04:00.827 --> 00:04:01.927
A nose bleed?

40
00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:03.327
Yes.

41
00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:06.527
I was so surprised when I see the corpse.

42
00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:10.027
I'll bet you got excited at seeing Ran's naked?

43
00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:12.027
Come on.

44
00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:15.727
Frankly, she's right.

45
00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:20.427
Is Hakuya dead?

46
00:04:28.627 --> 00:04:34.127
The victim was most likely drowned in the bathwater

47
00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:36.027
after being knocked unconscious

48
00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:39.327
by a blow from a blunt object to the back of his head.

49
00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:43.627
-"Jinsuke Ninda (29)" -Darn it! Why'd he have to be killed.

50
00:04:43.627 --> 00:04:47.127
"Sumika Kawana (28)"

51
00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:50.727
"Tamami Minegishi (28)"

52
00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:53.827
The victim was cleaning, you said.

53
00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:55.027
Yes.

54
00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:57.627
He was cleaning this bath tub and the bathroom.

55
00:04:57.627 --> 00:05:00.127
Every year when we come here,

56
00:05:00.127 --> 00:05:02.727
we each have fixed roles to carry out.

57
00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:06.327
Sumika cleans the rooms and corridors.

58
00:05:06.327 --> 00:05:10.427
Ninda does all our shopping most of the time,

59
00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:14.427
Because the nearest store is about a kilometer away.

60
00:05:14.427 --> 00:05:19.427
And, I'm in charge of making meals for everybody.

61
00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:23.527
Well, after we finish doing our fixed roles,

62
00:05:23.527 --> 00:05:26.427
we help the others out too.

63
00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:28.527
If I only didn't go shopping

64
00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:30.627
but helped Hakuya out instead,

65
00:05:30.627 --> 00:05:32.627
this wouldn't have happened.

66
00:05:32.627 --> 00:05:36.027
Then, when did you last see the victim?

67
00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:37.227
After lunch,

68
00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:39.827
he said he was going to clean the bath tub and bathroom,

69
00:05:39.827 --> 00:05:42.927
I haven't seen him at all since.

70
00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:46.827
When I looked into the bath room, he wasn't there.

71
00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:48.727
You looked into the bath tub?

72
00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:50.527
Yes.

73
00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:52.727
I saw steam coming out from the bath tub

74
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:56.927
so I thought that Hakuya had filled the tub for us, that's why.

75
00:05:56.927 --> 00:06:00.527
I looked into the bath room together with them..

76
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.127
Did you look into the bath tub back then too?

77
00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:06.827
Yes. I opened the lid to check the temperature of the water.

78
00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:12.627
But, back then there were no tomatoes floating in the tub.

79
00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:17.327
After that I finished cleaning the rooms with Sonoko and Sumika,

80
00:06:17.327 --> 00:06:20.627
we wanted to be the first ones to take a bath.

81
00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:26.627
That's when Sumika found a lot of tomatoes in the tub.

82
00:06:26.627 --> 00:06:28.927
After hearing about this,

83
00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:31.427
Conan and I rushed over.

84
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:34.527
Then we found Hakuya's corpse in the tub

85
00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.927
and pulled it out.

86
00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:39.427
That also means that

87
00:06:39.427 --> 00:06:42.527
you couldn't see the corpse until you pulled it up?

88
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:43.627
That right.

89
00:06:43.627 --> 00:06:46.827
The entire surface was covered with tomatoes, you see.

90
00:06:46.827 --> 00:06:50.327
And the water was green because of the bath salt too.

91
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.927
It seems that

92
00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:57.127
the corpse was held down using a dumbbell so it wouldn't come afloat.

93
00:06:57.127 --> 00:07:00.627
In other words, the killer, after sinking the corpse,

94
00:07:00.627 --> 00:07:03.227
filled the water with tomatoes

95
00:07:03.227 --> 00:07:05.827
in order to keep the corpse out of sight.

96
00:07:05.827 --> 00:07:08.027
In what order did you go in?

97
00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:12.527
-What? -The order that you took a bath.

98
00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:18.127
I think he's asking you in what order did you take a bath?

99
00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:22.927
If the first one who took a bath had a bag of tomatoes,

100
00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:26.027
that person could've put the tomatoes in the water, right?

101
00:07:26.027 --> 00:07:29.727
Don't tell me that the kid's suspecting us?

102
00:07:29.727 --> 00:07:33.127
The very first one was Sumika, right?

103
00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:38.827
I think she went in with only a bath towel to open the lid of the tub.

104
00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:40.027
Yes.

105
00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:45.527
We'd all notice if someone was holding a bag full of that many tomatoes.

106
00:07:45.527 --> 00:07:49.127
You get that, you precocious nose bleeding boy.

107
00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:51.327
In any case,

108
00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:54.327
that means the crime was committed between the time you finished cleaning,

109
00:07:54.327 --> 00:08:00.927
came to check the temperature of the water and came to take a bath.

110
00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:04.527
Can you tell me what the other two people were doing at this time?

111
00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:06.327
Sure.

112
00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:10.427
Like Tamami just mentioned I was out shopping.

113
00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:12.327
To a store that's about a kilometer

114
00:08:12.327 --> 00:08:14.727
and 15 minutes on foot from here.

115
00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.327
We didn't have any beer and stuff so, you see.

116
00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:21.327
On the way back, I happened to run into those two.

117
00:08:21.327 --> 00:08:22.627
Is that right?

118
00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:23.627
Yes.

119
00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:27.527
He gave me cold drink so I drank it while walking back here.

120
00:08:27.527 --> 00:08:29.727
I gave it to her right after I bought it,

121
00:08:29.727 --> 00:08:32.827
because I met her in the forest right near the store.

122
00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:35.327
Why were you two in the forest back then?

123
00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:37.927
We had several things we wanted to check out, you see.

124
00:08:37.927 --> 00:08:41.127
That's why I was going around the forest.

125
00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:42.627
Then, what about you, Tamami?

126
00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:47.027
What? I was cleaning the used dishes

127
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.127
and preparing dinner.

128
00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:51.227
Alone?

129
00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:54.427
Yes. I was alone in the kitchen.

130
00:08:54.427 --> 00:08:57.727
Then, you have no alibi.

131
00:08:57.727 --> 00:09:02.427
But, I talked to those two with the kitchen door between us.

132
00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:04.127
-Is that right? -Yes.

133
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.727
We were cleaning the living room

134
00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:08.727
in front of the kitchen back then, you see.

135
00:09:08.727 --> 00:09:12.827
Tamami asked us what we'd like for dinner.

136
00:09:12.827 --> 00:09:15.927
We also asked her if she needed help,

137
00:09:15.927 --> 00:09:19.227
she said that it's fine...

138
00:09:19.227 --> 00:09:22.227
I'm sure she was in the kitchen.

139
00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:23.327
I see.

140
00:09:23.327 --> 00:09:26.527
Sumika was also there back then too, correct?

141
00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:31.127
No, Sumika was cleaning upstairs alone.

142
00:09:31.127 --> 00:09:33.927
I thought it'd be faster if we cleaned together,

143
00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:36.827
so I went to the living room to call them.

144
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.327
After that, we continued cleaning together, the three of us.

145
00:09:39.327 --> 00:09:45.627
It's true that Sumika was cleaning upstairs until that time too.

146
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.427
Because we heard the loud sound of the vacuum cleaner

147
00:09:47.427 --> 00:09:51.527
as well as the parts of it hitting the walls and stuff.

148
00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:54.427
If so...

149
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.327
The one who was capable of committing the crime

150
00:09:56.327 --> 00:10:00.927
while you three, Sumika, Ran and Sonoko were cleaning

151
00:10:00.927 --> 00:10:05.627
is Tamami who was in the kitchen alone at this time.

152
00:10:05.627 --> 00:10:07.427
Wait!

153
00:10:07.427 --> 00:10:13.227
I was really in the kitchen till Ninda came back from shopping!

154
00:10:13.227 --> 00:10:15.427
I don't think Tamami could've done it, though.

155
00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:18.327
-What? -The only place I cleaned with them

156
00:10:18.327 --> 00:10:20.527
was the first floor where the bathroom is.

157
00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:25.127
Since Tamami knows that I always thoroughly clean the corridors,

158
00:10:25.127 --> 00:10:28.027
I don't think she'd risk killing somebody on the first floor.

159
00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.327
Besides...

160
00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:33.027
Tamami's not that type of person.

161
00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:34.827
Then, who on earth?

162
00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:37.727
Who else?

163
00:10:37.727 --> 00:10:39.927
The one who killed Hakuya.

164
00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:41.727
The Red Woman.

165
00:10:41.727 --> 00:10:44.227
Who else could it be but her?

166
00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:03.477
The Red Woman?

167
00:11:03.477 --> 00:11:04.877
You mean of 15 years ago?

168
00:11:04.877 --> 00:11:06.077
Yes.

169
00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:07.477
Fifteen years ago,

170
00:11:07.477 --> 00:11:10.777
that red devil who committed murder

171
00:11:10.777 --> 00:11:12.777
at a nearby rental villa.

172
00:11:12.777 --> 00:11:16.777
She must have been hiding in the forest somewhere.

173
00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:19.077
The one who cracked the window of this rental villa

174
00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:23.077
and threw in a lot of apples inside.

175
00:11:23.077 --> 00:11:28.877
The one who stuck a lot of red rose petals in the hot water tank

176
00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:31.977
and splashed red paint onto the door.

177
00:11:34.077 --> 00:11:37.377
Were all the works of The Red Woman.

178
00:11:37.377 --> 00:11:42.777
But, why did Hakuya have to fall victim to The Red Woman?

179
00:11:42.777 --> 00:11:44.777
The killer's a murderer you know!

180
00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:47.377
How the hell can you ever understand

181
00:11:47.377 --> 00:11:48.777
what's going on inside the mind of a psycho?

182
00:11:48.777 --> 00:11:52.977
Back then, the front door wasn't locked.

183
00:11:52.977 --> 00:11:56.777
The Red Woman doesn't know about Sumika's cleaning habit,

184
00:11:56.777 --> 00:11:59.977
sneaked in without being seen by anyone

185
00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:02.077
and killed Hakuya!

186
00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:04.177
She made us try to think of her

187
00:12:04.177 --> 00:12:07.777
by putting a lot of red tomatoes in the tub!

188
00:12:12.177 --> 00:12:14.077
That's impossible.

189
00:12:14.077 --> 00:12:16.777
The death of the murderer called The Red Woman,

190
00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:20.977
Komayo Takeno, has already been confirmed.

191
00:12:20.977 --> 00:12:22.177
What?

192
00:12:22.177 --> 00:12:25.677
But, in the news program that was aired the other day,

193
00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:28.077
they said she was still on the run.

194
00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:29.977
Three years after that incident,

195
00:12:29.977 --> 00:12:34.777
do you know that a girl's body was found in the swamp of this forest?

196
00:12:34.777 --> 00:12:36.277
Yes.

197
00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:38.677
That's Satoko.

198
00:12:38.677 --> 00:12:41.077
She was our classmate.

199
00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:42.377
I see.

200
00:12:42.377 --> 00:12:46.177
The fact is, another skeleton

201
00:12:46.177 --> 00:12:49.777
thought to be killed three years before that was also found then.

202
00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:53.377
Since the murder weapon knife was also found on the ground then,

203
00:12:53.377 --> 00:12:57.777
we kind of figured that it was Takeno's body but...

204
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.277
Takeno had set fire to her house before committing the crime

205
00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:03.577
and all her belongings went up in flames,

206
00:13:03.577 --> 00:13:07.677
therefore, we couldn't do a DNA match on her for quite some time.

207
00:13:07.677 --> 00:13:11.877
But, we found that Takeno's mother who died last week,

208
00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:15.477
had secretly kept her umbilical cord.

209
00:13:15.477 --> 00:13:19.077
So, after we did a DNA search of the bone marrow of the skeleton,

210
00:13:19.077 --> 00:13:20.977
it turned out to be a perfect match.

211
00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:26.877
That's why The Red Woman disappeared a long time ago already.

212
00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:31.277
This was scheduled to be announced to the media tomorrow.

213
00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.077
Since this case was of interest to many,

214
00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:35.177
the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

215
00:13:35.177 --> 00:13:37.877
is going haywires trying to handle this case.

216
00:13:37.877 --> 00:13:41.277
Then... Then, who is the killer?

217
00:13:41.277 --> 00:13:46.177
Don't tell me it's the ghost of The Red Woman or something?

218
00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:47.777
Up against a ghost,

219
00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:50.977
my bat for self-protection doesn't have a chance.

220
00:13:50.977 --> 00:13:55.677
I hope you're going to protect us all, Ms. Police Detective.

221
00:13:55.677 --> 00:13:58.377
Well, calm down.

222
00:13:58.377 --> 00:14:01.277
Will all three of you

223
00:14:01.277 --> 00:14:03.977
wait in your rooms until the investigation is over?

224
00:14:07.777 --> 00:14:09.277
I see.

225
00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:12.777
So, this is the bat you brought to confront The Red Woman?

226
00:14:12.777 --> 00:14:14.277
Yes.

227
00:14:14.277 --> 00:14:16.777
I brought it along so that I could use it to shoo away

228
00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:19.777
the one who was doing the pranks at this rental villa too, though.

229
00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:21.577
And, how about it?

230
00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:24.777
There're no visible marks on it

231
00:14:24.777 --> 00:14:27.177
or luminol reaction detected on it either.

232
00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:30.477
This isn't the murder weapon that was used to strike the victim to death.

233
00:14:30.477 --> 00:14:32.477
-But... -But?

234
00:14:32.477 --> 00:14:34.477
There seems to have been something stuck on to it

235
00:14:34.477 --> 00:14:36.777
and it's a bit sticky.

236
00:14:36.777 --> 00:14:38.277
Did you do anything to it?

237
00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:40.177
No, nothing in particular.

238
00:14:40.177 --> 00:14:41.877
Hey.

239
00:14:41.877 --> 00:14:44.577
Why's there a fan in this room

240
00:14:44.577 --> 00:14:46.677
when the air conditioners running?

241
00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:47.677
Beats me.

242
00:14:47.677 --> 00:14:51.077
Maybe a guest that doesn't like air conditioners

243
00:14:51.077 --> 00:14:53.677
took it out of storage and let it out?

244
00:14:53.677 --> 00:14:55.077
Officer Uehara.

245
00:14:55.077 --> 00:14:56.577
Anything?

246
00:14:56.577 --> 00:14:57.977
Well.

247
00:14:59.177 --> 00:15:00.177
What?

248
00:15:00.177 --> 00:15:01.877
The murder weapon is that dumbbell?

249
00:15:01.877 --> 00:15:04.177
The thing that kept the corpse underwater in the tub?

250
00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:07.977
Yes. Judging from the wound and the way the skull caved in,

251
00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:10.177
it's probably the weapon.

252
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:12.677
-Anything from Inspector Yamato? -Hey, Conan.

253
00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:14.277
No, not yet.

254
00:15:15.677 --> 00:15:17.077
What is it?

255
00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:19.677
What do you think?

256
00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:21.377
That's...

257
00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:22.577
But, why?

258
00:15:22.577 --> 00:15:26.277
Also, snatched this tomato from the site.

259
00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:28.077
I get it.

260
00:15:28.077 --> 00:15:29.777
Don't want to try it out?

261
00:15:29.777 --> 00:15:31.977
Yes! Of course.

262
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.577
Just as I thought.

263
00:15:37.577 --> 00:15:40.777
Yes. No doubt about it.

264
00:15:40.777 --> 00:15:42.777
So, the killer is.

265
00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:44.177
Yes.

266
00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:46.077
Most probably.

267
00:15:52.177 --> 00:15:55.077
Oh, no. It's started to rain.

268
00:15:55.077 --> 00:15:57.477
It sure looks like The Red Woman's going to appear.

269
00:15:57.477 --> 00:15:59.777
Hey, cut it out

270
00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:05.277
What?

271
00:16:05.277 --> 00:16:07.977
I thought I saw a woman with long hair

272
00:16:07.977 --> 00:16:10.977
standing outside the window right now.

273
00:16:10.977 --> 00:16:14.077
Cut it out! That's enough!

274
00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:15.777
Black out?

275
00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.477
What's wrong?

276
00:16:20.477 --> 00:16:22.877
Did somebody just go by?

277
00:16:22.877 --> 00:16:24.077
Yes.

278
00:16:39.977 --> 00:16:41.577
What? Who is it?

279
00:16:41.577 --> 00:16:44.277
Tamami? Ninda?

280
00:16:44.277 --> 00:16:46.277
What's with this black out?

281
00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:50.477
Who is it?

282
00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:54.077
Rather, you shouldn't be leaving your room until told to.

283
00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.477
Where's Sumika's room?

284
00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:01.577
This way!

285
00:17:09.177 --> 00:17:10.977
Hey, are you okay?

286
00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:15.677
Who did this to you?

287
00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:18.277
Red woman.

288
00:17:22.177 --> 00:17:23.377
Red woman?

289
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:25.377
No way possible, right?

290
00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:28.277
Her death's been confirmed.

291
00:17:28.277 --> 00:17:29.877
But...

292
00:17:29.877 --> 00:17:31.577
After the black out,

293
00:17:31.577 --> 00:17:34.577
somebody was tapping on the window.

294
00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:35.977
So, I opened the window.

295
00:17:37.377 --> 00:17:40.277
A woman with long hair was there.

296
00:17:40.277 --> 00:17:43.277
And suddenly came slashing at me with a knife.

297
00:17:43.277 --> 00:17:45.577
When I tried to flee, she slashed my back.

298
00:17:47.577 --> 00:17:50.577
Are you sure she was The Red Woman?

299
00:17:50.577 --> 00:17:52.877
Did you see her face?

300
00:17:52.877 --> 00:17:54.377
No I didn't.

301
00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:57.477
It was dark so all I saw was a silhouette.

302
00:17:57.477 --> 00:18:00.977
But if she had long hair and was holding a knife...

303
00:18:00.977 --> 00:18:03.177
Isn't she The Red Woman?

304
00:18:03.177 --> 00:18:04.877
Sumika!

305
00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:07.477
What's wrong?

306
00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:09.177
I'll treat her

307
00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.877
so will you help me take her to the living room?

308
00:18:11.877 --> 00:18:14.777
And let's all gather in the living room

309
00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:17.277
until the lights come back on again.

310
00:18:17.277 --> 00:18:20.977
Besides, it's dangerous to go off on your own in this dark.

311
00:18:22.377 --> 00:18:24.377
It's cut with something sharp.

312
00:18:24.377 --> 00:18:26.077
The wound looks shallow, though.

313
00:18:26.077 --> 00:18:28.477
Get me some disinfectant, Ran.

314
00:18:28.477 --> 00:18:29.777
Yes, sure

315
00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:33.977
Hey. Is this whole area really having a black out?

316
00:18:33.977 --> 00:18:35.177
Yes.

317
00:18:35.177 --> 00:18:37.777
A thunder bolt seems to have fallen on the substation.

318
00:18:37.777 --> 00:18:40.577
It's going to take some time till it recovers.

319
00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.477
You mean the killer attacked taking advantage

320
00:18:42.477 --> 00:18:44.777
of this coincidental black out?

321
00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:47.977
It'll sting a bit.

322
00:18:47.977 --> 00:18:49.177
Okay.

323
00:18:49.877 --> 00:18:53.677
But, is it true that The Red Woman attacked you?

324
00:18:53.677 --> 00:18:56.077
Yes. This wound is proof positive.

325
00:18:56.077 --> 00:18:58.877
But... she's dead, isn't she?

326
00:18:58.877 --> 00:19:02.677
Don't tell me that the umbilical cord used

327
00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:04.677
for the DNA test was somebody else's?

328
00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:06.077
No way.

329
00:19:06.077 --> 00:19:09.077
Her relatives also testified that her mother

330
00:19:09.077 --> 00:19:14.777
had been refusing to submit the umbilical cord to the police,

331
00:19:14.777 --> 00:19:17.877
because she didn't want to believe that her daughter was dead.

332
00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:22.477
Only, if so, there are several unexplainable points.

333
00:19:22.477 --> 00:19:24.377
Unexplainable points?

334
00:19:24.377 --> 00:19:26.177
The villa burglaries.

335
00:19:26.177 --> 00:19:27.777
From about ten years ago,

336
00:19:27.777 --> 00:19:31.277
we've been receiving reports

337
00:19:31.277 --> 00:19:33.977
of victimized rental villas near here.

338
00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:36.277
It's not pranks like what you mentioned a while ago

339
00:19:36.277 --> 00:19:42.677
like windows being cracked and things being thrown in.

340
00:19:42.677 --> 00:19:46.077
Somebody breaks the locks of the villas open

341
00:19:46.077 --> 00:19:49.077
and secretly lives there for some time.

342
00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:52.177
Testimonials of people having seen eerie silhouettes in the forest

343
00:19:52.177 --> 00:19:54.277
have also been reported.

344
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.177
That's why the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

345
00:19:56.177 --> 00:19:58.577
couldn't conclude for sure

346
00:19:58.577 --> 00:20:01.977
that the skeleton found in the swamp was actually The Red Woman.

347
00:20:01.977 --> 00:20:06.077
Then the person that I saw by the window was.

348
00:20:06.077 --> 00:20:08.877
-Sonoko. -You saw it? When?

349
00:20:08.877 --> 00:20:10.177
Where did you see it?

350
00:20:10.177 --> 00:20:12.477
Before the black out.

351
00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:16.077
Right outside that window. It was there.

352
00:20:16.077 --> 00:20:18.677
Behind the trees.

353
00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:22.177
She was looking this way with her neck tilted.

354
00:20:22.177 --> 00:20:25.977
The woman with the long hair.

355
00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:37.177
It's that woman.

356
00:20:37.177 --> 00:20:40.477
She's the one who attacked me.

357
00:20:40.477 --> 00:20:43.777
No way. Does she really exist?

358
00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:46.277
The evil spirit of The Red Woman?

359
00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:50.977
Let's hurry and get out of here, everybody.

360
00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:54.877
That's right!

361
00:20:54.877 --> 00:20:58.877
Otherwise, we'll all end up like Hakuya.

362
00:21:00.177 --> 00:21:01.577
There're no such things.

363
00:21:01.877 --> 00:21:03.777
Evil spirits or goblins.

364
00:21:03.777 --> 00:21:06.077
Witches or wizards.

365
00:21:06.077 --> 00:21:09.777
They all belong to the world of fantasy.

366
00:21:09.777 --> 00:21:13.577
Not even one of them exists in this world.

367
00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:16.977
Right, Conan?

368
00:21:16.977 --> 00:21:18.877
Oh. Yes.

369
00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.777
So, rest assured.

370
00:21:20.777 --> 00:21:21.877
Even if there were to be somebody,

371
00:21:21.877 --> 00:21:24.077
that person is a mere human.

372
00:21:24.077 --> 00:21:29.477
It's somebody who can be controlled by my Jeet Kune Do and Ran's Karate.

373
00:21:29.477 --> 00:21:31.377
Yes.

374
00:21:31.377 --> 00:21:33.677
It's been on my mind for some time,

375
00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:35.377
but who's talking?

376
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:39.477
You don't look to be a mere classmate of Ran's.

377
00:21:39.477 --> 00:21:42.577
I'm sorry I haven't introduced myself.

378
00:21:42.577 --> 00:21:44.477
I'm Masumi Sera.

379
00:21:44.477 --> 00:21:47.377
A high school girl detective, I guess you could say?

380
00:21:47.377 --> 00:21:51.177
She's our classmate, Sera's younger sister,

381
00:21:51.177 --> 00:21:54.177
and we called her here along with her friends,

382
00:21:54.177 --> 00:21:57.977
to solve the eerie occurrences happening in this rental villa.

383
00:21:57.977 --> 00:22:00.877
He tells us that he's busy and can't make it

384
00:22:00.877 --> 00:22:06.777
but his younger sister who came back from the States may have time to.

385
00:22:06.777 --> 00:22:09.377
Really? You've come back from the States?

386
00:22:09.377 --> 00:22:10.377
Yes.

387
00:22:10.377 --> 00:22:13.177
I've been living in the States since three years ago but...

388
00:22:13.177 --> 00:22:16.977
I got homesick for Japan and returned.

389
00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:24.177
In order to meet again with the magician.

390
00:23:52.477 --> 00:23:54.777
Maybe there's really is something in the forest...

391
00:23:54.777 --> 00:23:56.877
Hiding out there.

392
00:23:56.877 --> 00:24:00.177
End up like Satoko and Hakuya.

393
00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:02.777
The evil spirit of The Red Woman is going to kill us.

394
00:24:06.277 --> 00:24:09.277
Nobody's going to be killed.

395
00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:12.777
The evil spirit of The Red Woman that you're all talking about

396
00:24:12.777 --> 00:24:15.277
doesn't exist

397
00:24:15.277 --> 00:24:16.777
Next Conan,

398
00:24:16.777 --> 00:24:20.777
"The Tragedy of The Red Woman (Revenge)"

399
00:24:36.077 --> 00:24:38.777
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.977
"A long haired woman".

401
00:24:40.977 --> 00:24:42.777
-A long haired... -Woman?

402
00:24:42.777 --> 00:24:43.877
You mean me?

403
00:24:43.877 --> 00:24:45.577
What a scare.
