Thank you.

5
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,040
Did I make you wait?

6
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,920
This is a strange place to meet.

7
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,010
Can we talk in Japanese

8
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,120
so that people around us won't understand?

(Sherilyn Tan (40) Lawyer)
You won't be able to do anything strange.

10

(Leon Lowe (43) Management Consultant) That's too much.

12

13
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,410
Isn't it?

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,950
I've thought you and I had a good relationship as friends.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,100
No more idle chatter.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,550
I just want to hear your response to my proposal.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,070
Yes or NO?

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,860
Before I answer you.

19
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,920
I'll guess what you ordered.

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,220
It's not iced tea, it's champagne.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,530
No, it's wine.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,010

How did you know that?

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,550
I can read your mind.

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,180
- Huh?
- No thanks.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,950
Oh, hey.

Preserving the scene of the crime.

39
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,050
Otherwise this will be trampled over, right?

54

Could you ask him not to Interfere too much?

55
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,760
I can't ask him that.

56

00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,070
We went to an amusement park.

152

I saw a man in black

153
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,030
I witnessed the scene of a dubious dealing situation.

154
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,120
I was concentrating on watching that.

155
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,750
I didn't notice the other fellow coming up

behind me.

My body had shrunk.

160
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,940
If they find out that  Shinichi Kudo is still alive...

161
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,060
They'll try to kill me again, and harm to everyone around me.

162
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,170
I decided to hide my true identity
with the advice of Professor Agasa.

163

When Ran asked me my name.

164

I introduced myself, Conan Edogawa on a whim.

To get information about them,

166
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,310
I crashed at Ran's house,

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,900
Shinichi! Come here!

189
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,840
What?

190
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,550
Sorry to make you wait.

192
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,770
Where have you been? I was looking for you.

193
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,280
You said it's hot.

194
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,250
So I was leading Mister to the shade.

195
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,090
Thank you.

196
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,820
He never change, Uncle Kogoro.

197
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,010
Hey, Ran...

198
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,770
Can you get me some water?

199
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,420
I can't help it.

200
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,030
Come with me

201
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,490
Come on.

202
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,500
Okay

203
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,770
Whoa! It seems so lovey-dovey.

204
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,850
You bastard.

205
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,960
I'm back.

206
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,280
Dad, what are you wearing around your neck?

207
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,160
This is...

208
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,950
My passport, I keep it in here.

209
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,260
I don't want to get lost or stolen it.

210
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,400
Nice idea, isn't it?. Hmm?

211
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,600
Dad...

212
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
You don't have to do this.

213
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,310
Because Singapore is safe.

214
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,910
Hey, are you awake?

215
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,770
I knew it, bastard.

216
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,430
Well...

217
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,500
How did you get out of that suitcase?

218
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,760
This is.

219
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,100
If I insert the tip of this,

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,200
it will open unexpectedly easily even from inside.

221
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,490
I thought a ballpoint pen would be no problem.

222
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,170
I can't be too careful around you.

223
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,280
That's my line, Kaito Kid.

224
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,710
Oh, there it is.

225
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,140
Well, What's the meaning of this?

226
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,910
You know exactly what I mean.

227
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,670
There it is.

228
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,090
(Karate ZOHNHAN CUP)

229
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
That's Sonoko's

230
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,560
Late 19th century,

231
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,560
A legendary treasure that was said to have sunk

232
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,400
with a pirate ship in the sea near Singapore

233
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,690
World's largest blue sapphire

234
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,440
Also known as the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
Last year, Mr. Zhon Han Chen successfuly raised

236
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,530
the big jewel from the sea. That the one.

237
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,290
World Watch
Salvage Pirates Ship Treasure〜Singapore)

238
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,950
Zhon Han Chen is one of

239
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,680
the most powerful man in Singapore.

240
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,370
(Singapore Tycoon
Mr. Zhon Han Chen (70))

241
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,100
Yes.

242
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,760
And this old man loves martial arts.

243
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,970
He put the jewel in the championship belt.

244
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,820
He's decided to hold a karate tournament.

245
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,640
The legendary jewel goes to the winner.

246
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,740
It's a billionaire's hobby.

247
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,010
Yeah.

248
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,210
I was thinking of just taking the jewels

249
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,760
in the middle of the tournament.

250
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,770
But as the Kid,

251
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,930
I can't just enter Singapore.

252
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
If all you wanted was the jewels,

253
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,850
You don't have to bring me here.

254
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,500
It's a little bit special this time.

255
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,610
I'll tell you about it later.

256
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,010
Hey!

257
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,930
Huh? Shinichi?

258
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,710
- He's gone again?
- She is looking for me.

259
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,830
Wait, Kid.

260
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,280
If you do anything to Ran,  you're toast!

261
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,720
Sorry, but I can't guarantee that.

262
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,370
Then I'll tell her who you are right now.

263
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,280
You'd better not do that.

264
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,810
The only reason you got into Singapore was...

265
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,200
because of this suitcase.

266
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,870
It's a special suitcase that won't pass
the X-rays at the baggage check.

267
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,010
And it is a 12-hour oxygen generator inside.

268
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,940
It's filled with the finest cushioning,

269
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,660
that won't hurt your body even if you're in it for a long flight.

270
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,980
Do you understand what this means?

271
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,520
Great detective.

272
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,840
Without my help, without your passport,

273
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,190
you can't leave this country.

274
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,670
It means you'll never be able to return to Japan.

275
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,380
Shinichi!

276
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,500
You are always disappear.

277
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,850
Kid.

278
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,280
Why are you here?

279
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,830
Conan?

280
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,980
Ran away!

281
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,540
See, I'm surprised, too.

282
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,140
He's a local kid.

283
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,680
Is that so?

284
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,410
You guys are so easily fooled. - But you look so much alike.

285
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,690
What's your name?

286
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,000
Do you understand Japanese?

287
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,690
What?

288
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,210
This boy...

289
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,630
Arthur.

290
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,950
My name is Arthur Hirai.

291
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,050
Arthur Hirai?

292
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,000
My mother is Japanese. And...

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,660
I'm Sonoko Suzuki.

294
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,560
I'm Mouri Ran.

295
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,880
And over there, he is

296
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,040
That's my father, Kogoro Mouri.

297
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,870
Nice to meet you.

298
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,200
Nice to meet you, too.

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm sorry, Ran. I have to go.

300
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,070
Oh...yeah

301
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,830
Where's your mom and dad?

302
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,540
Um...

303
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,190
They're in Japan.

304
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,590
Are you home alone, Arthur?

305
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,290
Yeah.

306
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,480
But don't worry, I'm used to it.

307
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,460
Okay.

308
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,710
Then why don't you come with us?

309
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,300
Are you sure?

310
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,660
Yeah, sure.

311
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm gonna go check on my dad.

312
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,970
Sure.

313
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,030
By the way, still not here.

314
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,220
He could've texted me at least.

315
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,410
It's supposed to meet here.

316
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,860
Get out of my way!

317
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,160
Get out of the way!

318
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,230
What the hell is this?

319
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,240
What's with them?

320
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,150
That's Reijiro Nakatomi in the center.

321
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,590
Nakatomi? Yes.

322
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,400
The president of Nakatomi Shipping.

323
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,880
(Reijiro Nakatomi (39))He is a go getter,

324
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,910
but always giving rise to come scandal or other.

325
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,640
Hey, you.

326
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,690
All the way to Singapore and all alone?

327
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,510
Have a drink with me.

328
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,180
I don't have time for that right now.

329
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,430
Go away.

330
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,300
Do you think it is a good idea?

331
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,330
If you think so,

332
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,200
It's easy to bring you into my car.

333
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,840
(New message. Can't you come yet?
I'm waiting for you in front of the Merlion.)

334
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,960
Sonoko.

335
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,070
Shinichi.

336
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,520
Don't do anything extra.

337
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,630
Hey.

338
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,610
She is my girlfriend, so what's wrong with you?

339
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,580
Are you?

340
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,790
Makoto-san, check your e-mail, please.

341
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,170
Sorry.

342
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,670
I'm not good at tech.

343
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,360
Remember that.

344
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,850
Next time, it's my turn.

345
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,430
Makoto-san

346
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,410
I've been scared.

347
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,540
Sorry I'm late.

348
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,650
You're so cool.

349
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,630
I can do it too.

350
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,200
Hi-yah, hi-yah!

351
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,840
(Hey Karate Boy!)

352
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,000
How great!

353
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,920
(Hey come on!)

354
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,710
Sonoko, are you okay?

355
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,860
Yeah, Makoto-san protected me.

356
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,220
It's been a while, Kyogoku-san.

357
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,460
Good to see you too.

358
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,310
Are you?

359
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,310
Nice to meet you.

360
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,710
I'm Shinichi Kudo.

361
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,440
I'm Makoto Kyogoku.

362
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,450
Hmm?

363
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,830
What's wrong, Makoto-san?

364
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,010
Nothing.

365
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,830
I just don't feel I meet Kudo-kun for the first time.

366
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,130
It's just your imagination.

367
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,260
Now, we've seen the Merlion...

368
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,490
Let's go to our hotel.

369
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,310
Actually,

370
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,250
What?

371
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,310
You can't play in the tournament anymore.

372
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,310
We came here to watch your play.

373
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,040
Sorry.

374
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,560
Today's tournament,

375
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,120
A person invited me this match

376
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,250
but,

377
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,830
Your sponsor?

378
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,630
Yes, the lawyer,

379
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,360
Sherilyn Tan

380
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,560
She suggested to pay for all my travel
and accommodation expenses for the tournament

381
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,230
but, she suddenly passed away.

382
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,530
Today, the person concerned told me that

383
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,760
There was nothing happened, okay.

384
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,950
Oh, no.

385
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,280
I heard that some of the best players in Singapore
will be participating

386
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,970
in this tournament

387
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,160
I wanted to fight them once, but

388
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,020
All right.

389
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,550
I'll be your sponsor.

390
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,530
What?

391
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,320
Leave it to me.

392
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,750
- That's Miss Suzuki group.
- Uncle? Can you do me a favor?

393
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,590
(Uncle Jirokichi, Call Ended)

394
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,040
It's all right.

395
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,770
Makoto-san, I've made you re-enter as an invitee.

396
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,390
Really, Sonoko-san?

397
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,490
Yes.

398
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,750
I've shared Makoto-san hotel with us.

399
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,400
It's a double date.

400
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,200
That's right.

401
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,670
If it's all settled, let's go back to the hotel.

402
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,020
Hurry up and have a beer.

403
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,200
Mouri-san.

404
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,780
Are you Kogoro Mouri-san?

405
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,170
Yes.

406
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm Rishi, a reserve police officer.

407
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,900
It's an honor to meet you.

408
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,890
Well, well, well.

409
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,070
Then...

410
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,870
Reserve Police Officer?

411
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Yes, sir.

412
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,440
As an expert of criminal behavior psychology.

413
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,570
I've been joining investigation as an exception.

414
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,300
Oh, I see.

415
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,880
I've been waiting for you, Mouri-san.

416
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,110
Because I've heard you come in Singapore.

417
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,090
Were you waiting for me?

418
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,930
Yes, sir.

419
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,290
Most of the tourists come here.

420
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,930
But why me?

421
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,120
Actually, I need your help, Detective Mouri.

422
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,490
We have a case.

423
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,350
Oh, no, no, no.

424
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,210
I'm on vacation.

425
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,590
Oh, wait...

426
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,970
You'd better come with him.

427
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,500
What? Why?

428
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,680
Even though he is a reserve police officer,

429
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,020
He might introduce you

430
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,730
to good, cheap local restaurants.

431
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,250
Or the casino,

432
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,670
You know what I mean...

433
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,870
Well...

434
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,200
It could be...

435
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,770
All right.

436
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,460
I will help you, especially for you.

437
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,960
- Hey, hey...
- Thank you so much.

438
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,510
Speaking of Detective Mouri, you are hero in Japan
where my father's home country.

439
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,140
I am also a big fan of you.

440
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Actually, a businessman received something like this

441
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,730
Kaito Kid-Kid-sama.

442
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,180
(Notice I will capture in my fist the legendary treasure,
the Blue Sapphire protected by a lion. Kaito Kid)

443
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,960
(Leon Lowe's House)

444
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,820
I received report that Suzuki group

445
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,760
became the sponsor for Kyougoku.

446
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,250
Can you beat him?

447
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,960
There's no need for concern.

448
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,560
(Hezli Jamaluddin (25), Leon's Head of security)

449
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,960
No matter who I will put him down in one brow.

450
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,410
Good to know.

451
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,860
Come in.

452
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,950
Excuse me.

453
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,630
(Rachel Cheong (28)
Leon's Secretary)

454
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,500
Mr. Ramanathan has arrived

455
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,470
with someone he would like to introduce.

456
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,930
It's early.

457
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,270
Please bring him in to the lounge.

458
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,290
Understood.

459
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,870
So how about Kid?

460
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,000
Apologies, We are still investigating.

461
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,880
Among with Sherilyn Tan,

462
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,270
there is Issues with handling information.

463
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,730
I have a hunch he was behind it.

464
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,430
You take care with it them.

465
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,320
This is awesome.

466
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,130
Dad, be quiet.

467
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,580
Oh,  this armor's pretty cool too.

468
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,900
Are you okay?

469
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,940
Whoa!

470
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,890
Dad.

471
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,610
Behave yourself.

472
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,120
I'm sorry about my father. - Oh, I'm so sorry.

473
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,050
So, who is that Leon Lowe?

474
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,380
Mr. Lowe is originally a renowned criminal behavior psychologist.

475
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,400
He's worked with the police
to apprehend a number of violent criminals.

476
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,790
I see.

477
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,560
It's like a Singapore's great detective.

478
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,860
He left the police force two years ago.

479
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,770
and he is now the president of a very successful security firm.

480
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,400
Mr. Lowe taught me

481
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,450
a criminal behavior psychology.

482
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,820
I see.

483
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,550
So, Leon has got the notice.

484
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,010
No, I will explain you step by step.

485
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,760
First, take a look at this.

486
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,260
The Kaito Kid's aiming is

487
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,890
the jewels called the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

488
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,790
It belongs to a businessman named Zhon Han Chen.

489
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,860
The Kid's notice was delivered to him.

490
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,130
So we should go to this Zhon Han something.

491
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,940
The jewels are stored

492
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,310
in the basement of this house.

493
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,600
The jewels are in here?

494
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,920
Yes.

495
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,490
It is the owner's demand.

496
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,970
The safe here is specially-developed
with a state-of-the-art system

497
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,910
and better than a bank safe

498
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,940
State-of-the-art.

499
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,280
Even the Kid will have some trouble with this time.

500
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,220
Look who's talking.

501
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,690
What are you talking about?

502
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,800
No matter how advanced the safe is.

503
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,480
For Kid-sama, it's a piece of cake.

504
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,360
Sonoko.

505
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,280
You know Ran.

506
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,900
Kid-sama's brilliant thievery.

507
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,310
Any woman in the world,

508
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,230
we cannot stop him to steal our heart.

509
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,530
Stop Sonoko!

510
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,640
What?

511
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,720
Well, except for me and Ran, of course.

512
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,850
Don't you, Ran?

513
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,590
Oh, of course!

514
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,530
It might be no guarantee of your safety.

515
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,930
Hey, hey, hey!

516
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,970
Nice courtyard

517
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,250
So-so.

518
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,150
Nice to meet you all.

519
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,480
My name is Leon Lowe.

520
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,760
And my bodyguard and head of security.

521
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,820
Hezli Jamaluddin, he will join us.

522
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,240
Mr. Kyougoku

523
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
I was hoping to see you.

524
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,500
Thank you.

525
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,960
I do karate too.

526
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,840
I always wanted to have a match with you.

527
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,940
Oh, you're the great detective, Kogoro-san.

528
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

529
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,030
I didn't expect I'm so well known

530
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,510
even outside Japan.

531
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,300
It's weird.

532
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,390
I don't feed anything.

533
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,300
What is it?

534
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,740
No way.

535
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,090
And the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo-san.

536
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,730
Nice to meet you.

537
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,680
You look more like a magician than a detective.

538
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,980
Your fingers.

539
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,980
Thin and supple.

540
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,950
Even though I'm a detective, I'm more of a player than a fighter.

541
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,050
I'm more playing in here.

542
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
I see.

543
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,610
Oh, That's,

544
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,450
Sonoko Suzuki-san, right?

545
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,390
I can't be too careful with this one.

546
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,050
You can't come in. Please wait.

547
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,520
That's okay, don't bother.

548
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,120
Kogoro Mori-san.

549
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,170
My wife and I are big fan of you.

550
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,050
(Zhon Han Chen (70), Singapore Tycoon)

551
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,820
Whoa!

552
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,940
May I take a photo?

553
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,860
- Photo? Ok, ok. I'm glad.
- Sorry he came in all of the sudden.

554
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,160
It's alright.

555
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,770
I would like to show everyone our safe room.

556
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,870
That's good.

557
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,590
I would love to come along.

558
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,130
And the Fist of Blue Sapphire,

559
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,110
I'd like you to take a closer look.

560
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,640
This door leads to top of the safe.

561
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,000
Only a limited number of people can

562
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,090
open this door.

563
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,440
The walls are made of a heat-resistant alloy.

564
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,310
It can never be destroyed.

565
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,110
Why?

566
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,580
- Completely shielded from outside interference...
- Sorry sorry it's nothing

567
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,710
The location of each cargo

568
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,040
is moved periodically.

569
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,310
This safe is my dream.

570
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,590
It's specially made for me.

571
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,260
Oh, my God.

572
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,710
Everyone, please stand back.

573
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,320
This is the proof of the Pirate King.

574
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,770
It's the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

575
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,910
That's a big blue sapphire. - Can you see, Arthur-kun?

576
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,470
Yes, thank you.

577
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,180
All right.

578
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,550
As long as it's here.

579
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,080
No matter how hard the Kid tries, he can't touch it.

580
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,470
That's not how it works, sir.

581
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,140
During the karate tournament starting tomorrow.

582
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,040
The belt will be on display.

583
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,360
It's a rule.

584
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
So, during the tournament.

585
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,430
the belts will be stored in a room at the venue.

586
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,410
We'll have tighter security, but not as tight as here.

587
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,470
I see.

588
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,030
But there is also security for the stadium.

589
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,640
Yes, we should got it any cost.

590
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,580
If anything happened to the fist,

591
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,100
you'll be paying hefty compensation fee.

592
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,150
You said

593
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,170
the security is not as good as here.

594
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,040
So Kid is waiting for the sapphire

595
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,870
to be transferred to the venue.

596
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,190
You think so?

597
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,530
That's right.

598
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,840
It's too risky to go in here.

599
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,260
I agree.

600
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,930
I'll do what I can to help.

601
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,150
I'd like to help protect the jewels.

602
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,680
Thank you.

603
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,050
Easy peasy.

604
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,360
Whoa.

605
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,610
Got fingerprints.

606
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,040
Too easy?

607
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,330
I've been waiting for you.

608
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,560
Kaito Kid.

609
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,800
I can't believe you got this far.

610
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm impressed.

611
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,110
You've got a lot of confidence.

612
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,110
I'm afraid but,

613
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,350
I can't let you have the jewels.

614
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,700
I don't want to pay

615
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,080
compensation to Zhon Han Chen.

616
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,450
It's my job to steal that treasure.

617
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,270
And the harder it is to steal,

618
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,700
the more I'm excited.

619
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,640
It's over.

620
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,600
I hope you like the taste of Singaporean water.

621
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,990
No way.

622
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,890
I didn't expect you to use a taser.

623
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,680
Kid.

624
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
Oh, really?

625
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,310
What the heck?

626
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,640
What happen?

627
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,690
It's kid!

628
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,410
Don't worry, I'm always-

629
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,420
You know, the elite is always think of

630
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,430
the worst-case scenario.

631
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,350
One step ahead.

632
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,880
I've got to get out of here.

633
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:21,840
There he is!

634
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,240
What a thrust.

635
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,590
If I hadn't jumped back, I'd be in trouble.

636
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,240
Trespassing.

637
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,660
Right?

638
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,200
I mean...

639
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,650
What are you doing here?

640
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,030
I've been invited to train here.

641
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,950
but I didn't expect I'd ever match with you.

642
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,940
No, no, no. I don't want to.

643
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,180
No excuse.

644
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,250
Are you ready?

645
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,940
Soccer ball.

646
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,740
Where the hell is that from?

647
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,470
Thank you, great detective.

648
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,840
This is awesome.

649
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,990
I can perfect command with no wind.

650
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,930
I have to say thank my grandpa.

651
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,930
But...

652
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,920
I didn't know he could do that.

653
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,290
Thanks for the help.

654
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,100
It's a right decision I returned your gear,

655
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,200
just in case.

656
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,830
I didn't want to help you.

657
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,900
It doesn't matter.

658
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,310
It's time you told me.

659
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,830
Tell me why you brought me here.

660
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,000
(karate)

661
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,680
Leon's been looking for the Fist of Blue Sapphire

662
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,500
for years.

663
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,140
He was one step away from pulling it out.

664
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,670
Zhon Han Chen beat him to it.

665
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,100
Apparently,

666
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,650
someone leaked to him the location of the sunken ship.

667
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,460
The most suspicious one is Sherilyn Tan.

668
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,460
Once, she was the legal counsel for Leon's company.

669
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,070
for a time. But,

670
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,000
their relationship deteriorated.

671
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,240
Rumor has it that she became Kyogoku's sponsor,

672
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,690
because of Jamaluddin's victory.

673
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,140
In other words, she wanted to prevent

674
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,190
Leon from getting his hands on the jewels.

675
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,260
If that's true,

676
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,450
the rumor that she leaked the information about the sinking ship,

677
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,000
it has the ring of truth.

678
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,820
Then there was the murder of Sherilyn Tan.

679
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,570
If the leak rumors are true,

680
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,570
Leon would have had motive to kill Sherilyn.

681
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,890
What do the police think?

682
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,550
Unfortunately, Leon was taken off

683
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,360
the list of suspects.

684
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,940
Why?

685
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,430
Because there is more suspicious suspect.

686
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,770
Suspect?

687
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,450
The police haven't released it.

688
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,780
But at the scene of Sherilyn Tan's murder,

689
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,920
There was a card left.

690
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,150
It was my notice.

691
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,600
That makes sense.

692
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,050
But why the hell do I have to see

693
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,780
this romantic view with this guy?

694
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,640
I would love to see it with...

695
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,380
It's time to go back to Arthur Hirai.

696
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,060
By the way, Arthur is probably from Arthur Conan Doyle.

697
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,680
But, why Hirai?

698
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,450
Oh, that's?

699
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:22,970
(Ranpo Edogawa (Pen name))

700
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,510
(Arthur Conan Doyle)
I got it from Taro Hirai, the real name of Ranpo Edogawa.

701
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,700
(Arthur Hirai)
I got it.

702
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,990
Anyway, I'm pretty sure it's a trap.

703
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,990
I know it.

704
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,190
That's why I brought you here.

705
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,450
Great detective.

706
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,870
You're good at this sort of thing.

707
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,650
I know why.

708
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,020
I just don't like the way you do it.

709
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,590
The Kid-sama here.

710
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,710
You know, I can't keep quiet.

711
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,490
You're late.

712
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,840
I've been waiting a long time.

713
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,480
Sorry. Sorry.

714
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,640
Look at this.

715
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,780
What's a beautiful night view.

716
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,290
It's so romantic.

717
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,920
Don't be shy.

718
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,730
We're dating, aren't we?

719
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,630
Oh, yeah.

720
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,260
Are we?

721
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,560
Damn.

722
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,820
Does't she notice that he is faking?

723
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,010
But if she notice, I won't be able to go back to Japan...

724
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,000
(Raffles Hotel)

725
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,540
When it comes to Singapore...

726
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,380
Singapore Sling.

727
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,460
One more.

728
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,330
Mouri-san?

729
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,550
Huh? Are you...?

730
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,580
Do you mind if I sit here?

731
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,800
Please, please, please.

732
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,450
Let's drink together.

733
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,090
Actually, I...

734
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,800
Oh Gosh, what have I done?

735
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,780
I'm so sorry.

736
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,110
No, no, no. Please don't worry about it.

737
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,120
Mr. Mouri, call for you.

738
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,120
Hmm? Call?

739
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,600
It seems the call is for Mouri-san.

740
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,040
For me.

741
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,670
Who is it?

742
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,330
Mouri-san.

743
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,870
There's something I really need to tell you.

744
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,630
Come here tomorrow.

745
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,840
What?

746
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,830
Damn it.

747
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,510
Shoot, it's already hung up

748
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,710
Let's get Re-drinking.

749
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,350
Who do you think will win?

750
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,870
I think Kyogoku.

751
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,340
He's never lost.

752
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,770
I didn't know that.

753
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,280
I've never heard of that.

754
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,470
If enough effort is made in the right place and direction,

755
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,250
it will pay off.

756
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,430
Do you understand?

757
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,790
Yes, sir.

758
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,720
(Karate)

759
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,720
Fast.

760
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,460
This guy Jamaluddin.

761
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,850
He looks crazy strong.

762
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,100
He's got heavyweight power, speed, and technique.

763
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,130
He's got it all.

764
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,810
He looks tough.

765
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,190
That's the Teitan high school karate club captain.

766
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,560
You know a good thing when you see it.

767
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,380
Hey.

768
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,210
If the jewel ends up in Kyogoku-san's hands,

769
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,610
we don't think we'll be able to touch it anymore, right?

770
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,160
That's right.

771
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,150
I don't want to get too close to him.

772
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,360
Makoto-san is coming.

773
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,940
Everyone cheer him up!

774
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,040
Why is that local kid following us?

775
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,370
He takes to me very much.

776
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,980
Bow to each other.

777
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,610
Begin.

778
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,240
- Scared
- Yay! You're so cool, Makoto-san!

779
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,640
I want to go see him right now.

780
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,860
It's my dad.

781
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,810
(Incoming Call Dad)

782
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,990
I told you I'm not a suspicious person.

783
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,010
Dad.

784
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,010
What's going on?

785
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,190
Ran

786
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,200
Can you explain these guys.

787
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,010
I've taken out all the metal stuff.

788
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,830
But...

789
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,630
No entry.

790
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,820
That's enough.

791
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,860
No!

792
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,050
Damn it, I can't get in here!

793
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,520
Are you okay, Mouri-san?

794
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,040
Rishi-san.

795
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,360
He is staff member. Please let him in.

796
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,680
Yes sir.

797
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,190
Thank you, Mr. Rishi.

798
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,720
It was nice to meet you again.

799
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,530
The belt was unveiled at the opening ceremony.

800
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,050
It's being kept in the safe in the basement.

801
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,610
I can show you afterwards if you like.

802
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,400
Anyway, where have you been?

803
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,620
I've been just on patrol.

804
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,270
You must be hungover and oversleep.

805
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,480
The passcode changes every ten minutes.

806
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,560
It's managed by a computer.

807
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,930
We can get an e-mail.

808
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,330
Inspector Aidan and myself can receive it.

809
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,350
And Mr. Lowe, the safe manager.

810
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,300
Only three people.

811
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,720
It's just empty room.

812
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,190
No, it's not.

813
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,670
There are weight sensors on the floor,
surveillance cameras on the ceiling.

814
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,770
And the venue is surrounded by police officers.

815
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,490
I'm sure.

816
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,910
The Kid would do nothing about it.

817
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,690
Mouri-san, you can't smoke in here.

818
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,550
Oh, sorry.

819
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,990
Hmm?

820
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,950
I was so drunk. I've completely forgot it.

821
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,100
She gave me this last night at the bar.

822
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,650
She said she wanted to talk to me.

823
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,890
This is Leon-san's secretary's card.

824
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,770
What? Oh, really?

825
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,840
Actually, I was too drunk to remember.

826
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,740
How did you know it?

827
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,570
It's got the logo of Leon-san's company on it.

828
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,240
Logo mark?

829
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,190
3 p.m.

830
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,860
Back of National Stadium.

831
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,110
Meet in front of the door 3. It says.

832
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,090
It also says, TELL NO ONE.

833
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,110
Okay, 3 p.m., it means...

834
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,030
It's very soon.

835
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,440
Mouri-san.

836
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,250
It's rude to keep a lady waiting.

837
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,460
Hmm?

838
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,130
That was a really good match.

839
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,300
I'm looking forward to the semifinal and finals tomorrow.

840
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,070
Thank you very much.

841
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,580
Your strength is special.

842
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,650
Would you be interested in being my bodyguard?

843
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,630
No thank you, sir.

844
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,390
Wait a minute.

845
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,330
It was joking, of course.

846
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,990
Actually, I have one question for you.

847
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,750
Tell me.

848
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,370
What is the purpose of your fists?

849
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,830
In the pursuit of strength, what's beyond that?

850
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,880
What is it that drives you?

851
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,040
Can't you answer that?

852
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,570
An imperfect fist with no purpose is dangerous.

853
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,150
It makes you unhappy... and people around you.

854
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,600
You'll make everyone unhappy.

855
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,120
People around me are unhappy.

856
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,300
Yes.

857
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,120
For example, person who you love.

858
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,930
I'm sure you have someone like that.

859
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,050
Your fist may cause trouble,

860
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,620
and hurt your love one.

861
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,370
What would you do if that happened?

862
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,420
I'm looking forward to tomorrow's match, too.

863
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,450
Anything else?

864
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,360
Good job.

865
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,930
Sonoko-san.

866
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,410
You haven't come to see me for long, so I've come to see you.

867
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,350
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

868
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,930
Let's go lunch.

869
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,000
There's a restaurant I want to go.

870
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,060
Sorry, Sonoko.

871
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,220
Why don't you two go eat together?

872
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,780
Why?

873
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,100
I'm so sorry.

874
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,800
Shinichi is unlikely to leave here because of the jewel guard.

875
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,360
So, I don't think I can leave here, too.

876
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,970
I see.

877
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,110
Well then, it's no choice... let's go.

878
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Makoto-san

879
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,230
Okay.

880
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,970
See you later, Ran.

881
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,640
See you later.

882
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,530
I want you to have lots of food.

883
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,700
Thank you very much.

884
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,320
Now be alert and look everywhere.

885
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,860
If you see anything unusual. Report it.

886
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,700
And act immediately and-

887
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,240
Are you okay?

888
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,060
I'm so sorry.

889
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,730
I'm sorry too.

890
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,160
Inspector Aidan.

891
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,340
Sorry I couldn't help but notice.

892
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,400
I'm sorry what?

893
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,390
There you go,

894
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,290
Keep up the good work,

895
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,020
Yes mam!

896
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,060
Everything okay with the safe?

897
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,240
Yes sir everything is alright.

898
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,990
Excuse me I'm so sorry.

899
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:55,980
What's the matter?

900
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,750
Inspector Aidan Is calling you come quick.

901
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,480
B, But...

902
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,120
I look after this place.

903
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,690
O, okay.

904
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,050
Will be back soon thank you.

905
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,360
Well...

906
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,020
I'll take the treasure.

907
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,560
I got it.

908
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,650
What's wrong with it?

909
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,340
A dead body.

910
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,960
Rachel?

911
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,520
Omg, I gotta get out of here.

912
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,890
Hmm? Something letters...

913
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,310
Oh, shit.

914
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,400
Stop right there.

915
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,620
Drop the gun down.

916
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,350
Kid you are under arrest.

917
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,680
What?

918
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,500
Goddamn it, how much longer she keep me waiting?

919
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,720
Rachel-san.

920
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,310
Give her ten more minutes,

921
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,750
What the hell?

922
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,700
Is it the Kid?

923
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,050
Wait a minute.

924
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,030
He's here.

925
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:50,810
Holy shit!

926
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,100
But if I can get out of here, I'll be fine.

927
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,850
I can't believe they're so many.

928
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,620
Hey, wait.

929
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,050
Damn!

930
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,850
Go! Arrest him! At any cost!

931
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:23,880
Yes sir.

932
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,250
Are they okay?

933
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,170
Hey! I was looking for you, Mouri-san.

934
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,340
What a mess we've gotten ourselves into.

935
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,470
I didn't expect the Kid to show up in broad daylight like this.

936
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,510
Don't worry.

937
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,000
This great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

938
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,320
I'll start tracking him right away.

939
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,770
This is not the time.

940
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,160
Something terrible has happened.

941
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,250
Please come to the safe right now.

942
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,040
Look!

943
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,720
There's a giant bird in the sky!

944
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,120
Come this far, they won't catch

945
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,630
W,what's that.

946
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,130
The victim is Mr. Lowe's secretary.

947
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,700
Rachel-san.

948
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,550
Okay.

949
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,340
Have you checked the security cameras?

950
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,590
Nothing.

951
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,670
It's been hacked and transmitted

952
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,040
the unattended footage repeatedly.

953
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,950
So do you think who did it.

954
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,410
Of course we do.

955
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,040
We're doing everything we can to track him down.

956
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,950
track him down?

957
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,200
In other words.

958
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,800
I'm pretty sure it's the Kid.

959
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,010
Whatever, it's your fault

960
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,530
for not disabling the security system, Kid.

961
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,420
Hey, actually, at that time

962
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,930
Rachel-san was supposed to be at the stadium

963
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,760
to meet this old guy.

964
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,200
Why was she in the safe?

965
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,540
Well, I agree.

966
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,020
According to the cops in front of the safe.

967
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,210
She's there to tell him that
Inspector Aidan had an errand for him.

968
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,870
It was urgent.

969
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,270
I'm guessing that took priority.

970
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,100
And then there was that whole mess.

971
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,860
But I've never heard of the Kid killing anyone.

972
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,520
You can't just barge in.

973
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,650
What the hell?

974
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,860
(she)

975
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,490
Hey, look at this blood letters.

976
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,360
Hey!

977
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,090
Stay out of this, kid.

978
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,760
Look at this.

979
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,520
He've been completely trapped in their trap.

980
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,480
Kid.

981
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,260
Good job.

982
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:59,430
It's getting more interesting.

983
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,660
That's Sonoko-san's selection.

984
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,770
The chicken rice and watermelon juice were both good.

985
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,410
It was really delicious.

986
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,580
Right?

987
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,310
What is that?

988
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,900
Well, now we're full...

989
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,510
Makoto-san

990
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,950
I have somewhere to go.

991
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,560
I'll come with you wherever you go.

992
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,950
This looks bad.

993
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,650
Hey girl,

994
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,830
what you gonna do about this?

995
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,630
You're the one who hit me.

996
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,380
Hah? I don't know what you mean?

997
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,500
Come here!

998
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,050
There may be others hiding out here.

999
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,650
Sonoko-san.

1000
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,310
Stay close to me.

1001
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah.

1002
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,170
Your fist may cause trouble,

1003
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,920
and hurt your love one.

1004
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,010
Sonoko-san.

1005
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,250
Found it.

1006
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,240
Please help me.

1007
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,220
Sonoko-san!

1008
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,430
She alright?

1009
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,270
I'm calling the ambulance.

1010
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,480
Is she foreigner?

1011
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,760
Sonoko-san!

1012
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,000
Sonoko-san!

1013
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,680
Sonoko-san, Sonoko-san, Sonoko-san!

1014
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,430
What's the status of her injuries?

1015
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,680
They said it's not life-threatening.

1016
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,330
She's sleeping now, so she'll stay in the hospital tonight.

1017
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,010
They're doing examines tomorrow.

1018
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,320
What a relief.

1019
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,940
But a vicious hit-and-run...

1020
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,570
- It's unforgivable.
- It's my fault.

1021
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,120
It's my fault.

1022
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,120
Sonoko-san...

1023
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1024
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,480
I'm sorry I'm late.

1025
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,290
Thank you for your time.

1026
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,200
What's the status of the investigation?

1027
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:34,540
Yes, sir.

1028
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,230
The scene was a deserted back street. No witnesses.

1029
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,290
Well, technically, there was a person,

1030
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,910
but he was caught off guard and knocked unconscious

1031
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,490
when the police car was taken from someone.

1032
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,640
I hope I'm not interrupting you.

1033
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,300
Mr. Lowe

1034
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,620
What brings you here?

1035
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,610
As soon as I heard about the accident, I've hurried to come here.

1036
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,900
Sonoko was still asleep.

1037
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,400
Could you hand this to her, please?

1038
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,050
Thank you very much.

1039
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,390
It looks like my worries

1040
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,230
have come true.

1041
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,150
The gods of battle is giving you a test.

1042
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,590
You don't have enough mindset

1043
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,990
for shaking your fist, yet.

1044
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,740
Well, I'm giving you a charm.

1045
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,870
It's like a miçanga.

1046
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,000
When it breaks...

1047
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,620
the proof of being recognized by God as you have mindset.

1048
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,050
But if you shake your fist before it breaks...

1049
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,930
You know that, right?

1050
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,400
Ouch.

1051
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,260
That was a nasty hit.

1052
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,950
It's nothing like this.

1053
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,630
Oh, man, they shoot with no hesitation.

1054
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,560
They got me this time.

1055
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,890
They're blaming you for Rachel-san's murder.

1056
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,750
It's all a setup.

1057
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,720
It's all a trick to get you to take the blame.

1058
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,080
It's like magic.

1059
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,630
I was not even there, but

1060
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,690
the audience sees me as the killer.

1061
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,900
As if I was there.

1062
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,510
I mean, if you switch perspectives.

1063
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,700
I can see the trick.

1064
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,950
Yeah, it's the magician who makes you feel
as if there's something inside his fist.

1065
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,040
That's what magicians do.

1066
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,960
What's in his fist before he open it.

1067
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,160
We detective guess the answer correctly.

1068
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,890
Tell me what's in the fist, great detective.

1069
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,520
What's in that mysterious fist called "murder"?

1070
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,010
Jesus.

1071
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,000
Hey, little boy. You're not home yet, are you?

1072
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,060
Can I spend the night tonight?

1073
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,340
What, at my place?

1074
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,420
I'm all alone when I get home.

1075
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,490
After what just happened, I'm scared.

1076
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,690
I think it'll make my dad feel better

1077
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,460
If I'm with you, Rishi-san.

1078
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,210
Hmm...

1079
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,870
Two nights in a row with him.

1080
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,080
in the same room would be awful.

1081
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:42,870
Wow.

1082
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,900
Are these all from Rishi-san's father?

1083
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,390
He gave you all these?

1084
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,330
Yes, my dad was an oceanographer.

1085
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,330
He passed away five years ago.

1086
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,220
In the process of his research,
he found ruins that had sunk into the sea.

1087
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,110
You must be very proud of him.

1088
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,290
Yeah.

1089
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,990
Well, I've still got some work to do.

1090
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,900
Arthur-kun, you can go to bed first?

1091
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,560
Okay.

1092
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,140
Hey, Rishi-san...

1093
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,080
What are those red crosses on this map?

1094
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,400
These are the places where pirates attacked ships.

1095
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,860
Are there still pirates?

1096
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,910
Yes, there used to be many near Singapore.

1097
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,160
There used to be a lot of them.

1098
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,530
I'm not worried about pirates.

1099
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,590
I'm more worried about the murders now.

1100
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,800
And the Kaito Kid.

1101
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,750
I borrowed the files from Inspector Aidan.

1102
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,160
I'll be up all night tonight.

1103
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,740
I'm sorry, but Rishi-san,

1104
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,190
I'll let you sleep it off.

1105
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,670
Hey, what's that?

1106
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,490
Did you wear  that?

1107
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,900
Sonoko-san, are you awake?

1108
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,570
Actually I've been awake for a while.

1109
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,910
I'm glad, really.

1110
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,720
Is that some kind of lucky charm?

1111
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,190
Yeah.

1112
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,600
Something like that.

1113
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:27,790
Phew.

1114
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,990
No, you need to get some rest.

1115
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,660
I'm not sleepy at all.

1116
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,020
I've come all this way to Singapore. It's boring.

1117
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,020
Don't push yourself. It's not good for you.

1118
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,890
You should stay in bed tonight.

1119
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,650
I've been asking to you...

1120
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:50,690
Why don't you take off that bandage on your left eyebrow?

1121
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,170
It's nothing, really.

1122
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,550
I thought we were not supposed to meet

1123
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,170
until everything was done.

1124
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,660
You bragged your plan was perfect.

1125
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,620
But are you totally sure

1126
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:26,920
You look tough but you're actually a coward.

1127
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,750
Now watch your mouth.

1128
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,530
I always keep promises

1129
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,850
I do.

1130
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,510
If someone done to me, I'll give it back.

1131
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,700
That's my style.

1132
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,930
(In the semifinals, Makoto Kyogoku versus Tang Lee.)

1133
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,130
(Due to Kyogoku's withdrawal.)

1134
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,740
(Tang Lee will advance to the final.)

1135
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,180
Damn it!

1136
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,990
I didn't ask for this.

1137
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,530
He withdrew from the tournament?

1138
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,520
Why, because of me?

1139
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,720
We can't be sure that the people who attacked us

1140
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,860
won't attack us again.

1141
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,780
I can't leave Sonoko-san's alone.

1142
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,810
It's my fault after all.

1143
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,390
You should go to the tournament.

1144
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,690
You have someone you want to fight.

1145
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,110
I do.

1146
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,860
But I couldn't protect Sonoko-san.

1147
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,990
I still feel I'm missing something.

1148
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,770
I'm sure you're missing something.

1149
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:47,800
What?

1150
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,790
You're full of secrets, Makoto-san.

1151
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,130
Secrets?

1152
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,740
About the miçanga and the bandage.

1153
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,140
You never tell me.

1154
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,620
No, this is really...

1155
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,750
Get out.

1156
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,720
Yeah.

1157
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,660
I don't want to be protected by a man

1158
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,260
who is full of fake.

1159
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,800
I was really worried about you yesterday, okay?

1160
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,050
I've been trying to reach you.

1161
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,420
I'm sorry.

1162
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,100
I got caught up in chasing the Kid.

1163
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,240
That's the Moonlight Magician.

1164
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,950
Even this Shinichi Kudo can't catch him.

1165
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,850
Hi, Arthur-kun.

1166
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,940
Hello. - Ouch.

1167
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,330
Is your friend Sonoko Nee-san okay?

1168
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,280
I went to the hospital a while ago.

1169
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,060
The doctor said she's fine.

1170
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,280
She'll be out of the hospital this afternoon
and back at the hotel.

1171
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,930
I'm so happy to hear that.

1172
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,770
Thanks for worrying about her.

1173
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,270
It's better get back to the hotel.

1174
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,120
I need to pack my luggage for the trip home.

1175
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,640
Are you sure you leave Sonoko Nee-san and him?

1176
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,630
Yeah, I thought I'd leave them alone for a while.

1177
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,420
Those two seemed to be in some kind of trouble.

1178
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:58,250
And Kyogoku-san had to withdrawal his match.

1179
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,150
What? Shinichi?

1180
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,950
So, did you get anything last night? Great detective.

1181
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,660
According to the case files I found at Rishi-san's house.

1182
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,510
According to eyewitness accounts, Sherilyn-san was stabbed

1183
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,470
not at the mall where she collapsed.

1184
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,510
But it would be in an elevator in Tower 3.

1185
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,850
Why bother in the elevator?

1186
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,240
If it's fail, nowhere to run away.

1187
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,060
She was stabbed in her back with a store-bought knife.

1188
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,860
Then move to the shopping mall as it is

1189
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,430
And immediately after she collapsed,

1190
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,700
her car exploded in the underground parking lot.

1191
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,880
As a result, the entire hotel loses power.

1192
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,460
That's why all footage from the security cameras

1193
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,970
inside the hotel has gone.

1194
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:59,110
What's curious is that Leon was there.

1195
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,440
He booked his own room

1196
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,760
and Sherilyn-san's room as well.

1197
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,400
But when she was murdered,

1198
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,200
he was in another elevator.

1199
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,540
Many witnesses testified that.

1200
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,760
Because of that he proved his alibi.

1201
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,360
So he is out of the equation.

1202
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:14,780
Exactly.

1203
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,850
Speaking of which,

1204
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,460
why was Leon was carrying a suitcase?

1205
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,080
Oh, yeah, of course the police checked inside.

1206
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,180
But it was empty.

1207
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,560
The suitcase was in the shop for repairs.

1208
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,070
He just picked it up.

1209
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,070
The shop near the hotel,

1210
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:31,220
we've confirmed that they received the order from him.

1211
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,770
Perfect alibi.

1212
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,990
Only one thing left to do.

1213
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,360
This.

1214
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,890
Why was this left at the crime scene?

1215
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,190
Why involve me in this?

1216
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:45,040
He even went to the trouble of painting it with blood.

1217
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,330
Also...

1218
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,380
he's trying to pin Rachel-san's murder

1219
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,970
on you.

1220
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:55,220
The murder weapon was the same knife used to kill Sherilyn-san.

1221
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,100
Rachel-san was in the safe before I got there.

1222
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,050
She had been placed in the pedestal.

1223
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:04,410
But to get into the room, she had to get past the guards.

1224
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,620
and a number of security devices.

1225
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,850
The person who could get past the guards

1226
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,270
without touching the sensors.

1227
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,390
It's not me.

1228
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,060
It's Leon Lowe, after all.

1229
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,800
Leon is the one who manage the safe.

1230
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,780
He knows the security system inside and out.

1231
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,800
Moreover the belt was delivered to the stadium was

1232
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,070
yesterday morning.

1233
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,930
Rachel-san was confirmed alive

1234
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,500
until the night before last.

1235
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:34,190
So the crime was most likely committed from that night

1236
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,250
to before the belt was brought in.

1237
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,750
But for what?

1238
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,760
Why would he need to murder his own secretary?

1239
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,690
Maybe that's the motive.

1240
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,900
Rachel-san was trying to tell Mister something.

1241
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,450
The only clue we have left is that blood letters.

1242
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,510
She.

1243
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,960
Who's that?

1244
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:07,520
No, no, no.

1245
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,890
Something extraordinary is about to happen.

1246
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,180
I can't think straight.

1247
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,180
Even the great detective can't help it.

1248
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,660
Then let's take a break for a while.

1249
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,270
By the way, which in my fist, what's inside?

1250
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:21,370
Coconut water in your left fist.

1251
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,060
Correct.

1252
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,740
How did you know that?

1253
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,220
You bought it earlier.

1254
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,640
You've been spotted.

1255
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,790
Magic.

1256
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:32,910
It's the magician who makes you feel
as if there's something inside his fist.

1257
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,530
That's what magicians do.

1258
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:39,250
What's in his fist before he open it.

1259
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,280
We detective guess the answer correctly.

1260
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,520
I see.

1261
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,000
By the way, Miss Sonoko.

1262
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,750
She's in trouble with that karate guy?

1263
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,900
Apparently.

1264
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,590
Well, caught up in a brawl and a car accident  on the travel

1265
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,160
I guess that makes her mental unstable.

1266
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,300
I see.

1267
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,020
What?

1268
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,660
Causing Sonoko got Injured,

1269
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:01,940
shakes Kyogoku-san emotionally.

1270
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,350
To Jamaluddin's victory,

1271
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,920
The biggest obstacle was Kyogoku-san.

1272
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,690
I see.

1273
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,950
So, Leon set up the accident.

1274
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,260
Just as he planned, Kyogoku-san withdrew from the tournament.

1275
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,530
The championship belt is now definitely

1276
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:17,640
Jamaluddin's.

1277
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,420
Which means it's in the hands of his employer.

1278
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,090
Leon's hand.

1279
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,560
Along with the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1280
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,270
But why does Leon care so much about the Fist of Blue Sapphire?

1281
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,840
Why is Leon so obsessed with that?

1282
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,620
I think I've got a clue.

1283
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,410
The man Leon met with at dawn.

1284
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,810
Can you identify this guy?

1285
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,040
It's not impossible.

1286
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,640
You said to professor I'm going to Hokkaido.

1287
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,580
just out of the blue and long silence.

1288
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,690
What are you doing?

1289
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,240
Sorry, Haibara. I've got a lot going on.

1290
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,690
You guys, be quiet.

1291
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,010
Yes, sir.

1292
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,140
What the hell.

1293
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,920
You're involved in a case again, aren't you?

1294
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:57,570
Actually, you're right.

1295
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,460
I've just sent you the photos data Kid took.

1296
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,820
Kid?

1297
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:04,330
Did you say "Kid"?

1298
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,820
Really? Did Kaito Kid appear?

1299
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,650
It's Conan-kun, isn't it?

1300
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:11,380
Conan-kun is in Hokkaido, right?

1301
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:13,700
What's the Kid stealing?

1302
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,620
Maybe a hand-carved bear?

1303
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,120
Sapporo Ramen noodle?

1304
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:19,060
He wouldn't steal something like that.

1305
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,450
Ai-chan.

1306
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,990
Can I talk to Conan-kun on the phone?

1307
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,960
Me too.

1308
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,440
Sorry, kids are here.

1309
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,430
I'll tell you more when I get home.

1310
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,550
I need you to identify the man in the photos.

1311
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,130
Okay, okay, okay.

1312
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,680
So, you're really okay?

1313
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,600
I guess so.

1314
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,600
I'm sure there's no point in telling you.

1315
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,690
Don't overdo it.

1316
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:45,940
Thank you.

1317
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,370
It's OK now.

1318
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,010
So, what shall we do now? Great detective.

1319
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,260
Wait and see.

1320
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:56,410
What Leon will do now that he's got the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1321
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,700
But first, see Mister.

1322
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:01,210
Oh, wait a minute.

1323
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,750
(The John Han Cup Karate Champion is...)

1324
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:13,980
(Jamaluddin)

1325
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,110
So, what do you think of my city plan?

1326
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,960
We cannot accept your proposal.

1327
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,350
Why?

1328
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:31,080
You lose nothing with this plan.

1329
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,450
It's also benefit to the country.

1330
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,880
It's too hasty.

1331
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,350
If you proceed much development,

1332
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,590
some may be forced out of their homes.

1333
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,650
We can give them another place.

1334
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,150
The plan is perfect!

1335
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,560
You are too young.

1336
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,770
Learn some more and come back.

1337
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:57,950
Old fool.

1338
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,360
Your era is now at an end.

1339
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,590
I will build a new city.

1340
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,620
Hand in the air!

1341
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,190
Okay okay.

1342
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,000
You and I are well connected, aren't we?

1343
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,760
If this plan succeeds, we will be

1344
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,430
partners.

1345
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:34,160
I'm looking forward to working with you.

1346
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,580
You've helped me a lot.

1347
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:39,520
When I was taken to the police station on suspicion of theft,

1348
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,890
but you protected me.

1349
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,650
That was the first time.

1350
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,040
And a lot of things after that.

1351
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:50,420
Since I found out that you are that Reijiro Nakatomi.

1352
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,830
The Japanese shipping magnate,

1353
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,020
Juzo Nakatomi. You are son of him.

1354
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,660
Please don't mention my father's name.

1355
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,740
Oh, I beg your pardon.

1356
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:03,340
In any case, everything will change tonight.

1357
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,900
Why don't you come and watch it up close?

1358
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:11,060
Come with me.

1359
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:13,420
To witness a page in the history of

1360
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,640
Singapore.

1361
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,560
Huh?

1362
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:21,840
Sorry, Mister.

1363
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,300
What's going on?

1364
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,690
Stop it, pervert!

1365
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,440
This is it.

1366
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,850
Nakatomi.

1367
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,430
Nakatomi?

1368
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,950
Does it mean Nakatomi Shipping?

1369
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,270
Probably.

1370
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,580
Hey, Mister.

1371
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,830
I'll borrow this.

1372
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:45,150
Didn't you say "Mister"?

1373
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,570
That kid.

1374
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,350
Why are you leaving Japan so suddenly?

1375
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:52,400
It's a vacation. Vacation.

1376
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,130
You went to Singapore five years ago, didn't you?

1377
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:55,980
(Alleged Bribery of Politicians:
Direct interview President Nakatomi)

1378
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,100
Ah since then

1379
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:58,280
(President Nakatomi Shipping, Reijiro Nakatomi 39)
So what?

1380
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:59,930
President Nakatomi is currently
under suspicion of bribery by the Criminal Investigation...

1381
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:01,980
The guy at Merlion Park?

1382
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,390
That karate guy beat him up.

1383
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,640
Haibara?

1384
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:11,070
Have you found out who that guy is?

1385
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,840
Yeah, kind of.

1386
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,920
His name is Eugene Lim.

1387
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,760
What a surprise. He's a pirate.

1388
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:17,870
A pirate?

1389
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:21,100
There's been a recent sighting in Singapore.

1390
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,710
You're reliable, Haibara.

1391
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,670
You flatter me, so...

1392
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,510
you still want me to find out something, right?

1393
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:29,910
Y, yeah...

1394
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:33,920
Have you ever heard of Reijiro Nakatomi?

1395
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,330
Nakatomi Shipping?

1396
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:36,320
I know him.

1397
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,670
I want to know the status of the ships
owned by Nakatomi Shipping.

1398
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,310
Just the ships in and around Singapore.

1399
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,680
In near Singapore, there are two cargo ships

1400
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,780
and one tanker.

1401
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,400
I'm a little concerned about the tanker.

1402
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,130
The tanker is off its scheduled route.

1403
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,650
That's the one.

1404
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,280
Send me the info on that tanker.

1405
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,750
All right. I'll contact you again.

1406
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,900
Please.

1407
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:03,970
What's wrong with the tanker?

1408
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:07,050
It's the word "she" that Rachel left.

1409
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,620
She's also the word for ship.

1410
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,340
Is it true what you said on the phone?

1411
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,230
Everything that's happening right now,

1412
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,410
Mr. Lowe has plotted.

1413
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,160
You should explain it to me.

1414
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,420
It all started with something Zhon Han Chen found,

1415
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,580
the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1416
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:35,260
He mounted it in a champion belt for a karate tournament.

1417
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,200
The winner will get it.

1418
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:40,240
Leon-san made Jamaluddin-san enter the match

1419
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,300
and tried to get the jewels.

1420
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,440
However, he was interrupted unexpectedly.

1421
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,440
400 undefeated karate fighter.

1422
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,860
Makoto Kyogoku had entered the tournament.

1423
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,000
The one who invited him.

1424
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,400
That's the murdered Sherilyn Tan-san.

1425
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,720
Even if that's the motive,

1426
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,910
Mr. Lowe has an alibi.

1427
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,470
When she was stabbed,

1428
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,510
he was in a different elevator.

1429
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,530
Here's the truth.

1430
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,910
After her meeting with Leon by the pool,

1431
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:09,190
she got on the elevator

1432
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,690
to get back to her room.

1433
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,380
But the room she was staying in.

1434
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,310
Tower 3, where she was staying, was on the 16th floor.

1435
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:20,610
Because of the hotel structure,
she always had to change elevators

1436
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,680
on the 34th floor.

1437
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,940
She was on her way back to her room,

1438
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,590
She was taken to another room.

1439
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,060
By his secretary Rachel.

1440
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,440
Rachel was her accomplice.

1441
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,900
No way.

1442
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,630
Leon was there that day.

1443
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:38,010
The room he book just to enter the poolside guest restaurant was

1444
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:41,270
on the 34th floor.

1445
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,010
And when

1446
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,160
Leon came down, and in that room,

1447
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,550
He stabbed Sherilyn-san to death.

1448
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,180
He put her body in his suitcase.

1449
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,560
After that, Rachel and Leon got into separate elevators.

1450
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,160
I guess he used a kind of

1451
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,330
trick knife.

1452
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,290
But the blood was Sherilyn-san's own.

1453
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,470
Rachel fakes the being stabbed and collapses.

1454
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:12,880
Shortly thereafter,

1455
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,410
the explosion knocks out the power.

1456
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,300
It was all done in secret.

1457
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,840
Oh, no.

1458
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,430
Rachel knows Leon's true plan.

1459
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,530
She was so terrified that.

1460
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,110
She was going to tell Detective Mouri everything.

1461
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,330
Leon found out about it.

1462
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,240
The woman who came to the safe, Rachel-san,

1463
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,430
was the Kid in disguise.

1464
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,650
The Kid was used by him.

1465
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,330
in Leon-san's plot.

1466
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,930
The real Rachel-san had already been murdered.

1467
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:02,010
and put in the pedestal.

1468
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,050
I read that Kid was going to disguise himself as Rachel-san.

1469
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,730
He predicted that Kid was coming in disguise as Rachel-san

1470
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,950
to create his alibi and

1471
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,590
make the incident look like Kid did it.

1472
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,780
How is that possible?

1473
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:13,310
So, How about Rishi-san...

1474
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,360
Who would you disguise yourself as to be safe?

1475
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,390
Oh, right.

1476
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:20,400
No matter how well I disguise,
it's useless if I bump into the real person.

1477
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,960
No matter how well you disguise yourself,
it's useless if you bump into the real thing.

1478
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,510
I'd prefer someone who knows

1479
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,500
where he or she will be at what time in advance.

1480
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:28,200
I see, Rachel was going to meet Mouri-san at 3:00 PM.

1481
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,790
that's why

1482
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:33,440
Kid's coming to the safe.

1483
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,450
He'll disguise himself as someone who will never come

1484
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,450
That's how Leon-san predict it.

1485
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:39,400
The Kid fell right into his trap.

1486
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:42,320
So, tell me.

1487
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,820
What is Mr. Lowe attempting to?

1488
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,470
It's all part of a ridiculous plan.

1489
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:50,720
Leon has been in contact with a Pirate Chief,

1490
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,980
Eugene Lim.

1491
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:54,160
The writing on the pedestal at the scene of Rachel's murder.

1492
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,120
Her dying message is "She".

1493
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,510
And what Rachel had secretly entrusted to Detective Mouri was

1494
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,070
Nakatomi Shipping medal.

1495
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,350
All related to ships.

1496
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,360
What does that got to do with anything?

1497
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,410
Rishi-san

1498
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,430
This is sent to me from Tokyo by the detective brother.

1499
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,000
It's a route analysis of

1500
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,040
all the Nakatomi-owned ships in this area.

1501
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,960
One of the tankers has veered off course.

1502
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:22,350
If they keep going like this, they'll end up in Marina Bay.

1503
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,570
Leon-san plotting to use pirates

1504
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,930
to drive the tanker into city.

1505
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:36,650
First of all, why would he need to do that?

1506
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:37,720
Why is that?

1507
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:41,270
I don't know what Leon-san would say it, but...

1508
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,710
but if this city were destroyed and needed to rebuild it.

1509
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,570
I'm sure it would cost a fortune.

1510
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:51,370
The reason why Leon-san obsessed on the Fist of Blue Sapphire was

1511
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:55,070
because he needed it in exchange for
controlling the pirates as he wanted.

1512
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:58,830
But the pirates escape the attention of the police.

1513
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,360
They scatter all over the place.

1514
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,000
How did he get in touch with them?

1515
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,820
The Merlion.

1516
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,500
There was an incident with the Merlion spouting red water.

1517
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,510
It was reported worldwide.

1518
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,280
It must have caught the pirates' attention.

1519
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,660
That must have been the signal of action.

1520
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,870
But now,

1521
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,140
If we don't do something now, it'll be too late.

1522
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:20,950
Even if you say so, it's not up to me.

1523
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,920
I need more evidence to move the police.

1524
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,590
We don't have time.

1525
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:26,820
Is there any other way?

1526
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,580
Yes, we can talk to Mr. Zhon Han Chen.

1527
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:32,100
He's got connection to the military and the police.

1528
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,320
I'm sure he'll help us.

1529
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,040
One more thing, Rishi-san

1530
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,460
What?

1531
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,770
If the tanker crashes into the city as planned.

1532
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,230
Where do you think Leon-san will be?

1533
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,140
Let me think...

1534
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,130
He's a cautious man.

1535
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:49,520
He'll probably be somewhere far away watching.

1536
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,710
Maybe he won't be in Singapore anymore.

1537
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,550
I'll hurry.

1538
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,630
Okay. Thank you.

1539
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:08,480
Dad, where is he?

1540
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,250
The show's about to start.

1541
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:13,440
Shinichi's gone, too.

1542
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,800
I don't know how I got involved in all this.

1543
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,390
I wonder if it was Leon who left my card
at the scene of Sherilyn-san's murder.

1544
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,840
Was it really Leon?

1545
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,690
No.

1546
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,090
The card was found on the elevator.

1547
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:32,510
It was found until long
after the crime scene inspection had begun.

1548
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,520
Do you wonder why?

1549
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,160
Whoa.

1550
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,900
The latest tanker track analysis.

1551
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:42,980
Huh?

1552
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:45,350
The tanker's heading to the hotel.

1553
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,580
Ran, pick up the phone.

1554
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:54,100
Coming this way!

1555
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,700
Hey, Ran, having fun?

1556
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,650
Dad, where are you?

1557
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:46,100
Ugh? I don't know where I am but,

1558
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,880
I can see a huge ship.

1559
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:50,480
Hey Dad...

1560
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,340
Are you top of the hotel?

1561
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,490
(Ran Mouri)
Hello, hello, hello

1562
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,330
Can we make it?

1563
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,520
I think so.

1564
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,430
Sonoko-san. Sonoko-san.

1565
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,790
What?

1566
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,420
Something's happened outside.

1567
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:10,690
I think we should leave the hotel.

1568
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,340
Yes, sir.

1569
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,560
Yeah, okay.

1570
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,340
Who was that?

1571
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,640
The police officer.

1572
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,110
If I go out,

1573
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,020
I might be targeted again. They might try to kill me again.

1574
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,650
He told me to stay in my room.

1575
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,020
They're sending a guard.

1576
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,390
B,But...

1577
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,270
Don't worry, I'll stay here.

1578
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,260
Okay.

1579
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,950
I can't get near the hotel with this crowd.

1580
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,850
I'll take my chances.

1581
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,670
It's kid!

1582
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,670
It's kid. Kid here.

1583
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:08,160
It's a private party.

1584
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,210
What the hell?

1585
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,850
Sleeping Kogoro...

1586
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,030
I really don't know just about him.

1587
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,830
I can't get her!

1588
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,650
Oh no!

1589
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,170
Where is he, Dad?

1590
01:24:58,370 --> 01:24:59,320
Look,

1591
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,230
the city will be born again

1592
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:03,860
with my hands.

1593
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,340
Why are you?

1594
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,630
Wait!

1595
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,310
What a surprise.

1596
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:25,950
I didn't know you were capable of so much.

1597
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,350
I couldn't predict it.

1598
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,540
Rishi.

1599
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,490
I'll admit it.

1600
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,470
Yes, this is all my plan.

1601
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,310
Let's have a little talk.

1602
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,710
Please put it down.

1603
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:46,000
I think you've got it all wrong, Mr. Lowe.

1604
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,320
What?

1605
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,340
Freeze!

1606
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:52,610
There's no one here.

1607
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,000
We are stopping ship now.

1608
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:15,510
The tanker stopped.

1609
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,610
Kid.

1610
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:17,990
Let's leave the police handle this.

1611
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,240
Yeah.

1612
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,850
The tanker!

1613
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,080
What happened?

1614
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:24,630
I'll be quiet.

1615
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:25,960
Please don't shoot me.

1616
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,230
Help me.

1617
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,180
Please don't kill me.

1618
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,220
Rishi-kun!

1619
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,560
I never thought you shoot us.

1620
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,350
(Jamaluddin! )

1621
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,360
W wait!

1622
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,870
Jamaluddin, what are you thinking?

1623
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,070
The only reason work for you

1624
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,910
with the fight again Kyogoku.

1625
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:47,310
I have no such reason anymore.

1626
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,450
What?

1627
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:49,690
Mr. Lowe.

1628
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:52,900
I'm afraid but I think you've lost a bit of your touch.

1629
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:56,230
You're not the one running the world.

1630
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,140
It's me.

1631
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,060
No, you

1632
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:06,010
Wait, wait, wait.

1633
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,060
I'll give you this.

1634
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,210
There's a jewel inside.

1635
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,060
It's good deal, Rishi-kun.

1636
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,560
Kaito Kid.

1637
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,000
Why are you here, Arthur-kun?

1638
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,670
To get to the roof, I have to change elevator on the 34th floor.

1639
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:37,540
Hey!

1640
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,480
Wait.

1641
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:50,650
Are they

1642
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,940
heading to the Marina Bay Sands?

1643
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,420
What are you doing?

1644
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:00,090
I was trying to catch

1645
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,600
the two ringleaders.

1646
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,880
I know you are faking it!

1647
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,090
Rishi Ramanathan.

1648
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:07,640
I know you're the mastermind behind all this.

1649
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:10,200
My first question was,

1650
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:12,780
the notice the Kid left at the scene.

1651
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,150
The police officer found out the notice shortly after

1652
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,350
you arrived at the scene, right?

1653
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,760
And just now.

1654
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,000
When I asked you where Leon-san would be,

1655
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,260
my suspicions about you were confirmed.

1656
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,750
What?

1657
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,190
A man as conceited as Leon-san.

1658
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,190
Will he flee abroad just as he was about to

1659
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:32,850
complete his plan?

1660
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:35,700
I'm sure he is looking at the place

1661
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,200
with the best view.

1662
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:40,240
You can't be unaware of that.

1663
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:44,540
I'm surprised. You tested me.

1664
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,200
It all started five years ago.

1665
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:49,570
Your father's accident was the beginning of your plan.

1666
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,830
Suspect admits killing oceanographer

1667
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,250
After initial denial

1668
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:56,080
Probably

1669
01:28:57,580 --> 01:29:01,310
It is also five years ago
Nakatomi-san visited Singapore, isn't it?

1670
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:03,280
I...

1671
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,740
Leon-san caught the culprit.

1672
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,390
Sherilyn-san defended him,

1673
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:08,750
and made him plead guilty.

1674
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,000
I don't think it's all just a coincidence.

1675
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,820
What do you mean?

1676
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,500
It was a trick to get tankers

1677
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,510
owned by Nakatomi Shipping.

1678
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,040
The whole thing was a setup.

1679
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:23,530
And there was another trick.

1680
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,730
You must've noticed that.

1681
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:29,970
I thought it was an accident, too, at first.

1682
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:33,970
But when I was sorting through my father's belongings,

1683
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,150
I found out that while he was investigating underwater ruins,

1684
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:38,550
he accidentally discovered a sunken ship

1685
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,110
that was most likely to have the proof of the Pirate King,

1686
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:43,090
the Fist of Blue Sapphire.

1687
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,630
That's probably why he killed my father first.

1688
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,470
He didn't want him to get to the jewel first.

1689
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,030
Help!

1690
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:53,450
Someone push in the back!

1691
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,220
Help is on the way!

1692
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:57,960
Hurry!

1693
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,020
Helping.

1694
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,200
Because he knew my father had a strong sense of justice,

1695
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,590
He was sure my father would definitely go to help.

1696
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,560
What the hell, Leon?

1697
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:18,880
Get off me!

1698
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:24,570
Rishi-kun, you've got some wrong.

1699
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,360
Your father's culprit is in prison.

1700
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,660
I had my doubts about my father's death.

1701
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,500
I became your apprentice in Singapore.

1702
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,990
I became a reserve police officer.

1703
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,700
And I started looking into the accident.

1704
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:39,200
I approached Sherrilyn Tan, who was lawyer in charge of the case.

1705
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:42,900
I asked her if we could use Reijiro's case to blackmail Leon.

1706
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,810
She gave me the lowdown.

1707
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,520
And Rachel.

1708
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,690
Yes, through her,

1709
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,880
I knew everything about you guys.

1710
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:56,280
Then why did you put up the Kid notice?

1711
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:58,310
Tell me why.

1712
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,750
The Fist of Blue Sapphire

1713
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,180
And a murder he did not get involved at all.

1714
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:07,120
Those two things would definitely lure the Kid.

1715
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:10,460
And he would thwart your plans.

1716
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:14,650
The high-school detective's appearance was unexpected.

1717
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,640
But he's done his job.

1718
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,230
Nakatomi-san.

1719
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:21,900
I heard that Leon protected you

1720
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,630
from being accused of stealing.

1721
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:25,780
But, was that really a coincidence?

1722
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,800
Think about it.

1723
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,410
Maybe...

1724
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,030
All of it.

1725
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,100
You.

1726
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,880
You've done your research, Rishi-kun.

1727
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,580
Where am I? I think...

1728
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,670
Dad

1729
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,470
Ran. What?

1730
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,550
What is it?

1731
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,610
Dad

1732
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:05,690
Ran

1733
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,090
Over!

1734
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:10,400
Everycrew tell the chopper too!

1735
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:15,800
What is it with you guys?

1736
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:18,370
Well, Rishi-kun...

1737
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:21,190
Unfortunately, the tables have turned

1738
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,450
(ユージーン　計画は失敗したが)

1739
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:26,200
You can take this jewel.

1740
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,100
Take care of everyone here.

1741
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,150
Yes.

1742
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:35,640
What are you doing?

1743
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,340
Don't move.

1744
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:41,060
Help!

1745
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,030
Now that I have the jewel I have no need for you.

1746
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:46,050
What?

1747
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:49,500
I have no time for your nonsense.

1748
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:52,310
I am known to the break promises.

1749
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:55,550
It's just there was more a lucrative offer.

1750
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,350
What do you want?

1751
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:02,020
What a smart boy you are!

1752
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:04,570
That's right.

1753
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,700
The daughter of Suzuki group is in this hotel.

1754
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,310
If we kidnap her the ransom will be huge.

1755
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,750
Hasn't she already evacuated?

1756
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:14,940
She's still in her suite.

1757
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:18,560
I called her and not to leave the room.

1758
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,700
W,what, Makoto-san?

1759
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,570
Excuse me.

1760
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,550
The elevators were all stopped.

1761
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:29,540
Let's get out of here.

1762
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,040
There come on!

1763
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,180
Don't shoot! You hit her!

1764
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:40,120
Makoto-san, what's this all about?

1765
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:47,820
Look.

1766
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:51,070
In the end, everything will be exactly as I envisioned it.

1767
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:53,850
This city will be burned to the ground and reborn.

1768
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,290
You'll never see it.

1769
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:11,650
What? They're going to locket us?

1770
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,850
Hey, you!

1771
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:30,960
Damn!

1772
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,010
Take that!

1773
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,220
Get down now!

1774
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,340
Makoto-san!

1775
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:51,070
What? What?

1776
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:52,510
Get them!

1777
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,440
- Open!
- Brat!

1778
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,570
Come, come, come

1779
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,530
What is going on here?

1780
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:07,610
I don't know.

1781
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,890
Most of the pirates now in the hotel.

1782
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:12,010
Just what is going on inside?

1783
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:14,590
It's dangerous you too, please give back.

1784
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,460
You okay?

1785
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,740
Ah, yeah

1786
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:50,040
If we don't do something, they'll really destroy the city.

1787
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:53,370
Damn it. Is there got to be a better way?

1788
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:56,910
We could use that.

1789
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:58,370
Got it.

1790
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:59,350
Kid.

1791
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,450
Are you sure about that?

1792
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,400
Of course I am.

1793
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,370
That's the going kid!

1794
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:10,560
Shoot him down.

1795
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,760
Boss we can't hit him!

1796
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,090
(Clever bird.)

1797
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,550
Hey, before we do that.

1798
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:21,590
We've got to deal with those pirates.

1799
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:23,840
We only have one Card gun left.

1800
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,570
We still have one bullet.

1801
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:31,920
We've got a chance to turn the tables on them.

1802
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,920
I see.

1803
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,700
We'll go in.

1804
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,670
Wait!

1805
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,530
Makoto-san.

1806
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:01,850
Get down!

1807
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:05,160
Stay back!

1808
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,620
He is

1809
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,180
mine.

1810
01:37:12,630 --> 01:37:13,630
Kid.

1811
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:15,670
Take me to the bow.

1812
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,080
I know.

1813
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,430
Ran, stay back.

1814
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,690
Ran.

1815
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,870
Come on!

1816
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,540
What the hell is going on here?

1817
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,960
Shinichi's voice.

1818
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,440
Are you okay?

1819
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,550
Arthur, why are you here?

1820
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,400
I was worried about you.

1821
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,150
Thank you.

1822
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:05,130
Where the hell is he?

1823
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,100
I'm glad you're okay.

1824
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:11,700
What?

1825
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,870
Thank you.

1826
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:21,990
Makoto-san.

1827
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,720
Kid got jewell.

1828
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,480
Can you hit him down?

1829
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:28,240
Okay boss.

1830
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,010
Damn stay still.

1831
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,390
Take this!

1832
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,540
Hit it?

1833
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,390
I'm okey, Sonoko-san.

1834
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:54,010
Oh no!

1835
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:55,400
What?

1836
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,290
Kid,

1837
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:57,320
you!

1838
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,370
Hi.

1839
01:38:58,950 --> 01:38:59,880
Wait!

1840
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,540
Help me out!

1841
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,010
Going down!

1842
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:13,480
You're bleeding.

1843
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:16,490
Sonoko-san, excuse me.

1844
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:19,350
What? What are you doing?

1845
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,510
What are you doing here?

1846
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,350
Wait!

1847
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,450
It's a sling-rope carry.

1848
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:31,480
Sonoko-san, this time for sure,

1849
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,810
Please don't go away.

1850
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,860
I can't go away even if I wanted to.

1851
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:24,000
Where is he?

1852
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:53,630
Kyogoku-san.

1853
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,490
Grab something.

1854
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:39,940
Are you alright?

1855
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:51,900
I'll give it back.

1856
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,160
That thing.

1857
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:58,030
It's not the jewel I'm looking for.

1858
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,760
Sonoko-san.

1859
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:10,080
Could you sit over here for a minute?

1860
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,000
I'm sorry.

1861
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:14,870
I tied a knot too tightly.

1862
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:21,340
It's untied.

1863
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:25,320
No, that's...

1864
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,200
It's my good luck charm.

1865
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:31,090
Have you been putting on this?

1866
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,040
Yes.

1867
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:36,520
I couldn't tell you because I thought
it would reflect on my manly honor, but...

1868
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,750
I see.

1869
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:41,250
I thought I was always protected.

1870
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:44,370
I was protecting you, Makoto-san.

1871
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,720
I see... I see...

1872
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:55,520
Please give me back the bandage.

1873
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,530
No!

1874
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:57,640
Please.

1875
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,270
- This is my treasure forever.
- Sonoko-san.

1876
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,790
Lovey-dovey.

1877
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:10,550
Who the hell are you?

1878
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,650
are you?

1879
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:14,670
You're not just some kid.

1880
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,250
Conan Edogawa.

1881
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,650
I'm a detective.

1882
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,730
But is that okay?

1883
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:18,430
You've let that strong boyfriend go to America, again.

1884
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:19,750
It's okay.

1885
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:23,250
Makoto-san has to be fighting somewhere.

1886
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:26,590
Oh, there they are.

1887
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,240
What's that?

1888
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:31,210
Don't get so attached.

1889
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:32,290
It's hard to walk.

1890
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:35,370
I'll never let you go.

1891
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:36,440
What? Really?

1892
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,200
I've been waiting a long time for this.

1893
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:42,040
This moment.

1894
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:45,390
I've been waiting for you, Kid.

1895
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,010
Seriously.

1896
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:48,650
I knew you weren't Shinichi

1897
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:50,360
from the beginning.

1898
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:51,590
Shinichi

1899
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:52,580
What's that? -He never call

1900
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,550
my dad "Mister".

1901
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,580
Because he's always calling him that.

1902
01:47:57,150 --> 01:48:00,210
I've never called him "Mister" in front of Ran.

1903
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,920
I can't believe it. You've disguised as Shinichi
not once, but twice.

1904
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:03,870
I never forgive you.

1905
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:06,980
Don't you ever let go of his arm, young lady!

1906
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:08,460
Got it.

1907
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,530
Kid.

1908
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,040
I won't let you go.

1909
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,790
Don't let go.

1910
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,060
Hey, professor.

1911
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,050
He's not here.

1912
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,300
Oh, he's gone.

1913
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,490
Damn it.

1914
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:38,300
He must still be close. Catch him.

1915
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:39,560
(EXIT)

1916
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:45,240
Conan-kun!

1917
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,860
Welcome home, Ran-Neechan.

1918
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:50,320
I'm home.

1919
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:53,100
Didn't you miss me?

1920
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,350
No way.

1921
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:57,520
I was with you all the time.

1922
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:16,590
Reach out.

1923
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:19,910
(Great detective Conan)
Faraway

1924
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,830
(To be released in 2020GW!!)
