1
00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:03.524
It says here that on the day the incident occurred,

2
00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.324
after work, you stopped over

3
00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:08.024
at a pub on Suehiro Avenue called Espa,

4
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:10.724
and drank beer along with 180 cc of sake,

5
00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.724
then left the pub at around 20:00.

6
00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:15.424
Is this correct?

7
00:00:15.424 --> 00:00:16.524
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:18.524
At the Toriyacho intersection,

9
00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:21.224
a little after 23:00, you hit the victim,

10
00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:23.224
who was on his way home with your car.

11
00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:26.824
Where and what were you doing during this time?

12
00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:29.624
I figured I should cool off a bit before going home,

13
00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:33.024
so I took a rest in the car, and fell asleep.

14
00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.924
Is there anyone who can testify this for you?

15
00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:37.224
No.

16
00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:38.924
Why did you flee from the scene of the accident

17
00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:42.424
instead of helping the victim right away?

18
00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:44.324
I got so upset...

19
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:47.124
that I...

20
00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:49.224
Is that really the only reason?

21
00:00:54.124 --> 00:00:55.924
Ten days have already gone by

22
00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:57.824
since you've been detained,

23
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.824
but is the prosecutor asking you every day?

24
00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:07.724
Ms. Kujo, the prosecutor in charge is an able woman.

25
00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:11.424
She would never detain anyone for 10 days without reason.

26
00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:16.224
I'm on your side.

27
00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:17.724
So, even if it is something disadvantageous to you,

28
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.524
please be honest with me.

29
00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:32.724
Ms. Kisaki.

30
00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:35.424
Have you come to talk to the suspect?

31
00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:37.224
Yes, sort of...

32
00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:39.324
Great timing, Ms. Kujo.

33
00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:41.124
I'd like to talk to you.

34
00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:42.924
What is it?

35
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:44.924
It's been a while since Mr. Takeuchi's detained,

36
00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:49.224
so I'd like to ask you to release him. Isn't it about time?

37
00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:51.024
He turned himself in,

38
00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:53.824
and since he's already admitted to committing the crime,

39
00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:56.924
is there any further reason you should keep him detained?

40
00:01:56.924 --> 00:01:58.824
I hate to put it this way,

41
00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:04.424
but I'd like that judgment to be left up to me.

42
00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.224
Then, I'll submit a request for you

43
00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:08.824
to make public the reason for his detention.

44
00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:11.124
Please go ahead and do what you must.

45
00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:13.124
If you will excuse me, goodbye.

46
00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:17.424
What are you after, Prosecutor Kujo?

47
00:02:20.024 --> 00:02:23.224
Only to bring the truth to light.

48
00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:26.124
It's so unlike you, Ms. Kujo.

49
00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:27.824
I'll see you in court.

50
00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.924
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

51
00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:42.124
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

52
00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:43.824
Two sizzling hot rivals.

53
00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:45.724
Attorney At Law, Kisaki,

54
00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:47.024
confronts a competent prosecutor in court.

55
00:02:47.024 --> 00:02:48.724
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:50.124
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:52.024
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.074
"Prosecutor is Witness".

59
00:04:41.374 --> 00:04:45.774
Really, why do I have to do something like this?

60
00:04:45.774 --> 00:04:49.374
But this job is what you asked mom to do, isn't it?

61
00:04:49.374 --> 00:04:51.674
I only asked her because the woman owner of a shop that I frequent

62
00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:54.974
asked me if I knew a good lawyer.

63
00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:56.674
I hear that prosecutor Kujo was hiding

64
00:04:56.674 --> 00:04:58.874
the fact that she was in charge of the case.

65
00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:01.874
It's a simple case, in which all that's left to do now

66
00:05:01.874 --> 00:05:05.574
is to lighten the sentence as much as possible

67
00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:07.374
after pleading extenuating circumstances.

68
00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.874
It doesn't matter who the prosecutor is!

69
00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:11.574
Just as Pops says

70
00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:14.874
there should be no room for a confrontation in court.

71
00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:17.774
I wonder what Prosecutor Kujo is after.

72
00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:20.974
"Toriya Police Station"

73
00:05:22.274 --> 00:05:24.974
Thank you for coming from so far away.

74
00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:27.574
This is the car that had the accident.

75
00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:30.374
If I remember correctly, the victim was on a bicycle.

76
00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:32.774
Yes, sir. According to an eye-witness,

77
00:05:32.774 --> 00:05:33.874
the car ran the red light

78
00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:36.874
and hit the bicycle upon entering the intersection.

79
00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:38.374
From the traces left behind,

80
00:05:38.374 --> 00:05:39.974
it is thought that the driver was going

81
00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:42.074
at a speed of almost 60 kilometers.

82
00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:44.074
How terrible.

83
00:05:44.074 --> 00:05:45.374
Hey, Kid.

84
00:05:45.374 --> 00:05:47.274
Don't go touching the evidence.

85
00:05:47.274 --> 00:05:48.474
Pops.

86
00:05:48.474 --> 00:05:51.674
How tall was the man called Takeuchi?

87
00:05:51.674 --> 00:05:53.574
How tall?

88
00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:57.374
I think he was a bit taller than me.

89
00:05:57.374 --> 00:06:01.374
Then, I wonder if someone else drove the car after the accident?

90
00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:02.774
Don't be silly.

91
00:06:02.774 --> 00:06:04.674
There's no way that anyone could've driven the car

92
00:06:04.674 --> 00:06:06.574
after such an accident.

93
00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.774
But look at this seat.

94
00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:14.274
See, the seat is pushed a lot to the front, right?

95
00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:18.074
I think it would even be hard for you to drive this way, Pops.

96
00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:21.374
True. Maybe it's just about right for me.

97
00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:23.674
When you confiscated this car,

98
00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:26.074
did a women officer drive it?

99
00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:27.374
No way!

100
00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:30.474
We would never drive a vehicle that serves as evidence.

101
00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:32.374
We brought this car here from the condo of the suspect

102
00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:34.774
using a tow truck.

103
00:06:34.774 --> 00:06:37.574
Then, maybe the forensic officers moved the seat forward

104
00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:39.574
when they inspected it.

105
00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:43.274
No, the forensic officer didn't move the seat either.

106
00:06:43.274 --> 00:06:46.774
I'm sure because Prosecutor Kujo was very careful

107
00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:48.574
about confirming that point too.

108
00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.874
Madonna was?

109
00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:51.474
Yes, that's right.

110
00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:53.774
I mean she was so very persistent.

111
00:06:58.974 --> 00:07:02.474
Just as the bicycle was about to cross the intersection

112
00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:04.674
the car rammed into the bicycle.

113
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.274
And, where were you at that time?

114
00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:08.674
I was stopped at the traffic signal at this corner here

115
00:07:08.674 --> 00:07:10.674
waiting for the light to change.

116
00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:23.874
Oh, no.

117
00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:26.074
Since the driver screeched to a stop,

118
00:07:26.074 --> 00:07:28.274
I thought he was going to come out of the car to help the victim,

119
00:07:28.274 --> 00:07:30.474
but he just hit and ran.

120
00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:32.474
And, did you see the driver's face?

121
00:07:32.474 --> 00:07:34.474
No, because it was dark,

122
00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:36.674
and he didn't come out of the car.

123
00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:38.074
I see.

124
00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:40.174
Sir?

125
00:07:40.174 --> 00:07:42.174
Wasn't the driver

126
00:07:42.174 --> 00:07:44.474
a very small person?

127
00:07:44.474 --> 00:07:46.674
Sonny, how did you know...

128
00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:47.674
Well?

129
00:07:47.674 --> 00:07:50.874
Yes, the prosecutor asked me the same question too.

130
00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:53.474
However, since the driver didn't come out of the car,

131
00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:55.674
I couldn't tell how tall the driver was, or if it was a man or a woman.

132
00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:56.774
Hey, wait up!

133
00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:58.574
What do you mean it was a woman?

134
00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:00.674
The one who turned himself in is a man!

135
00:08:00.674 --> 00:08:03.774
I know because I read the papers.

136
00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:06.074
I thought that was a queer question to ask me.

137
00:08:06.074 --> 00:08:08.274
And, what did you answer, Sir?

138
00:08:08.274 --> 00:08:10.474
So, like I said, I didn't see the driver,

139
00:08:10.474 --> 00:08:11.874
so I couldn't answer.

140
00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:13.374
I guess not.

141
00:08:13.374 --> 00:08:16.274
And, was there anything else you noticed?

142
00:08:16.274 --> 00:08:20.074
Well, something I noticed...

143
00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:29.274
That's right, when the culprit fled

144
00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:31.574
something glistened around here.

145
00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:33.174
Not glasses?

146
00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:36.774
No, it had more glitter.

147
00:08:36.774 --> 00:08:38.674
Accessory?

148
00:08:45.674 --> 00:08:47.174
-We're home! -We're home!

149
00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:50.174
You're back, Ran and Conan.

150
00:08:50.174 --> 00:08:51.574
Either way, we'll just have to

151
00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:54.974
wait and see what the prosecutor has to say.

152
00:08:54.974 --> 00:08:57.774
I'll pay you a good sum,

153
00:08:57.774 --> 00:08:59.374
so please just see to it that everything turns out okay.

154
00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:03.774
Your husband seems to be exhausted too,

155
00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:07.674
so please go see him as much as you can.

156
00:09:07.674 --> 00:09:10.474
I'm busy with work, you see.

157
00:09:10.474 --> 00:09:11.774
Goodbye.

158
00:09:20.074 --> 00:09:21.674
You say that the driver of the car that got into the accident

159
00:09:21.674 --> 00:09:23.874
may have been a woman?

160
00:09:23.874 --> 00:09:24.874
It seems that Prosecutor Kujo was

161
00:09:24.874 --> 00:09:27.774
asking the taxi driver whether the driver of the car was a woman.

162
00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:30.974
Is she saying that my client is lying?

163
00:09:30.974 --> 00:09:33.874
Maybe he's a scapegoat.

164
00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:36.274
A hit-and run is a serious crime.

165
00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:37.774
It's not possible that someone would act as a scapegoat.

166
00:09:37.774 --> 00:09:40.474
Don't tell me he's doing it for his wife?

167
00:09:40.474 --> 00:09:44.574
The seat of the car would be a perfect fit for his wife's height.

168
00:09:44.574 --> 00:09:47.374
Maybe Prosecutor Kujo is not releasing him

169
00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:49.474
because that's what she's after?

170
00:09:52.674 --> 00:09:54.774
Ms. Kuriyama.

171
00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:57.674
Mrs. Takeuchi said that she was busy with work,

172
00:09:57.674 --> 00:09:59.374
but what does she do?

173
00:09:59.374 --> 00:10:03.774
Something about she succeeded her father who passed away last year,

174
00:10:03.774 --> 00:10:06.574
and is now the president of her father's company.

175
00:10:06.574 --> 00:10:08.774
His wife is of a higher rank than he is.

176
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.374
Yes, but I don't think

177
00:10:10.374 --> 00:10:11.774
he'll act as a scapegoat in a hit-and-run case

178
00:10:11.774 --> 00:10:13.574
unless he has a good reason.

179
00:10:13.574 --> 00:10:14.674
Ms. Kuriyama.

180
00:10:14.674 --> 00:10:15.874
Yes.

181
00:10:15.874 --> 00:10:17.274
Will you call the investigation company

182
00:10:17.274 --> 00:10:19.274
and gather the staff immediately?

183
00:10:19.274 --> 00:10:21.874
We need to redo the investigation.

184
00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:23.174
Okay!

185
00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:29.974
This case doesn't seem to be a mere hit-and-run incident.

186
00:10:58.352 --> 00:10:59.652
Ms. Kujo?

187
00:11:00.752 --> 00:11:02.152
May I have a moment with you?

188
00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:05.952
Please wait ten minutes

189
00:11:05.952 --> 00:11:08.052
because I have two more kilometers to go.

190
00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:11.352
Okay, I'll be at the lounge downstairs.

191
00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:13.152
All right.

192
00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:20.152
I'm sorry to intrude on you during your lunch break.

193
00:11:20.152 --> 00:11:21.852
No problem.

194
00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:25.252
So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?

195
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:26.852
Well, you see.

196
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.252
Let me get straight to the point, then.

197
00:11:29.252 --> 00:11:32.052
Please release Mr. Takeuchi right now!

198
00:11:33.552 --> 00:11:36.152
You're not after Mr. Takeuchi,

199
00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:38.652
but rather his wife, aren't you?

200
00:11:38.652 --> 00:11:41.052
Just what are you doing?

201
00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:45.052
Doing something similar to arresting someone on a holding charge.

202
00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:47.752
Or do you have something else in mind?

203
00:11:49.652 --> 00:11:51.452
Okay.

204
00:11:51.452 --> 00:11:53.352
I'll approve his release.

205
00:11:53.352 --> 00:11:54.552
Huh?

206
00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:56.352
Bye, then, I have a case to attend to.

207
00:11:56.352 --> 00:11:58.552
Hey, Ms. Kujo!

208
00:11:58.552 --> 00:11:59.852
Ms. Kujo?

209
00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:09.252
-Huh? -He was released?

210
00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:11.452
Yes, just a while ago.

211
00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:13.452
He's talking to Ms. Kisaki now.

212
00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:19.452
At least now you've been released.

213
00:12:19.452 --> 00:12:22.052
But the tough part has just begun.

214
00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:25.052
If you really need my help,

215
00:12:25.052 --> 00:12:27.552
please tell me the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

216
00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:30.352
I've told you the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

217
00:12:30.352 --> 00:12:31.652
Ms. Kisaki.

218
00:12:34.952 --> 00:12:36.452
Well,

219
00:12:36.452 --> 00:12:39.452
I guess I'll go get myself a good drink, since it's been a while.

220
00:12:39.452 --> 00:12:41.452
-Mr. Takeuchi. -Huh?

221
00:12:41.452 --> 00:12:45.052
Didn't you turn yourself in as a scapegoat for your wife?

222
00:12:46.752 --> 00:12:48.652
Why'd you do such a stupid thing?

223
00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:51.052
No, I did it.

224
00:12:51.052 --> 00:12:53.352
Don't lie to me!

225
00:12:53.352 --> 00:12:55.652
Do you have proof or something?

226
00:12:55.652 --> 00:12:58.052
The prosecution is investigating on that line too.

227
00:12:58.052 --> 00:13:01.752
If they have evidence, she should've been arrested long ago.

228
00:13:01.752 --> 00:13:05.152
Do you think something like that would work for Prosecutor Kujo?

229
00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.252
If it's about that woman prosecutor,

230
00:13:08.252 --> 00:13:10.052
I know her very well.

231
00:13:11.252 --> 00:13:12.552
Just what do you mean?

232
00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:14.952
At any rate, I'm counting on you.

233
00:13:14.952 --> 00:13:15.952
Wait!

234
00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:17.052
Shoots!

235
00:13:24.252 --> 00:13:27.052
Not too good, Kid.

236
00:13:27.052 --> 00:13:29.552
Eavesdropping is a crime.

237
00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.452
Bye, then.

238
00:13:31.452 --> 00:13:35.452
He knew about Prosecutor Kujo to begin with?

239
00:13:58.352 --> 00:13:59.752
What?

240
00:13:59.752 --> 00:14:02.452
You have a phone call from suspect Takeuchi,

241
00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:03.452
what would you like to do?

242
00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:07.252
Okay, I'll take it.

243
00:14:07.252 --> 00:14:08.452
Number 3.

244
00:14:10.152 --> 00:14:12.352
Hello. This is Kujo.

245
00:14:15.752 --> 00:14:18.152
"Mouri Detective Agency"

246
00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:26.452
"Takeuchi Construction Company Subject of Construction Scandal"

247
00:14:26.452 --> 00:14:28.452
I found it, here it is!

248
00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.252
What're you looking at, Conan?

249
00:14:30.252 --> 00:14:32.352
Mr. Takeuchi's company

250
00:14:32.352 --> 00:14:36.652
was scandalized for shoddy construction five years ago, wasn't it?

251
00:14:36.652 --> 00:14:38.652
I wonder is that really true.

252
00:14:38.652 --> 00:14:40.352
Yeah.

253
00:14:40.352 --> 00:14:41.752
It was supposed to have evolved into

254
00:14:41.752 --> 00:14:44.852
a case involving the political world too,

255
00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:46.952
but the department head of the subsidiary design company

256
00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:49.052
committed suicide and all vanished into smoke.

257
00:14:49.052 --> 00:14:50.152
As a result, it seems that the senior prosecutor

258
00:14:50.152 --> 00:14:52.852
was flown over to a remote district.

259
00:14:52.852 --> 00:14:54.752
What about it?

260
00:14:54.752 --> 00:14:58.052
Maybe it has nothing to do with what's happening now,

261
00:14:58.052 --> 00:15:02.452
but I was just wondering around when Mr. Takeuchi got to know Ms. Kujo.

262
00:15:02.452 --> 00:15:06.552
What? Takeuchi and Madonna knew each other from before?

263
00:15:06.552 --> 00:15:09.752
Yes, he said so, at Ms. Kisaki's place.

264
00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:12.752
He says he knows a lot about Prosecutor Kujo.

265
00:15:12.752 --> 00:15:16.452
I haven't heard he's been arrested before, though.

266
00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:18.152
Hey, Pops.

267
00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:21.552
I watch a lot of news like these on TV

268
00:15:21.552 --> 00:15:24.052
but doesn't the special investigation department handle cases like these?

269
00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:25.052
I see!

270
00:15:25.052 --> 00:15:28.152
If Madonna was in that special investigation department

271
00:15:28.152 --> 00:15:32.952
and if Takeuchi was involved in the case...

272
00:15:32.952 --> 00:15:36.152
Maybe there's something behind all this.

273
00:15:39.652 --> 00:15:42.952
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

274
00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:45.952
Oh, Ms. Kuriyama.

275
00:15:45.952 --> 00:15:47.452
Yes, he's here.

276
00:15:47.452 --> 00:15:49.852
Dad, it's from Ms. Kuriyama.

277
00:15:49.852 --> 00:15:51.252
She says it's an emergency.

278
00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.152
What's up?

279
00:15:55.152 --> 00:15:57.652
What? Takeuchi died?

280
00:15:57.652 --> 00:15:59.452
Just what do you mean?

281
00:15:59.452 --> 00:16:01.952
How'd he die?

282
00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:16.652
Ms. Kisaki, Mr. Mouri is...

283
00:16:16.652 --> 00:16:18.052
Dear.

284
00:16:18.052 --> 00:16:20.352
Hey, what's going on?

285
00:16:20.352 --> 00:16:22.352
Is it true that Takeuchi died?

286
00:16:22.352 --> 00:16:23.452
Yes.

287
00:16:23.452 --> 00:16:28.052
He jumped off the veranda of his room on the sixth floor of this condo.

288
00:16:28.052 --> 00:16:30.152
He seems to have died instantly.

289
00:16:30.152 --> 00:16:31.652
He jumped?

290
00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:32.752
You mean he committed suicide?

291
00:16:32.752 --> 00:16:33.952
It seems to be so.

292
00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:35.052
Absurd!

293
00:16:35.052 --> 00:16:37.152
He was finally released and yet!

294
00:16:37.152 --> 00:16:39.052
I realized that too!

295
00:16:39.052 --> 00:16:41.352
I'm confused myself.

296
00:16:41.352 --> 00:16:43.552
Isn't there a possibility that it was an accident?

297
00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:44.952
No, there isn't.

298
00:16:44.952 --> 00:16:47.152
They even found a will.

299
00:16:47.152 --> 00:16:50.052
Moreover, there's an eye-witness.

300
00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.652
An eye-witness?

301
00:16:56.052 --> 00:16:58.752
Don't tell me that...

302
00:17:10.547 --> 00:17:11.947
Ms. Kujo.

303
00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:15.247

Hey, you!

Just what do you think you're doing there?

309
00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:50.347
Get out of here!

310
00:17:50.347 --> 00:17:51.847
Get out of here this minute!

311
00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:54.047
He died because of you!

312
00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:55.047
You murderer!

313
00:17:55.047 --> 00:17:57.047
Mariko, please calm down.

314
00:17:57.047 --> 00:17:58.747
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

315
00:17:58.747 --> 00:18:00.447
Will you please leave?

316
00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:02.347
Please, at least let me offer him incense.

317
00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.147
Ms. Kujo.

318
00:18:04.147 --> 00:18:07.147
Why not leave for today?

319
00:18:07.147 --> 00:18:10.447
I'll be back again.

320
00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:12.047
Come now, I'll give you a lift home.

321
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:13.747
I'd like to ask you something too.

322
00:18:19.347 --> 00:18:21.547
Thank you very much.

323
00:18:21.547 --> 00:18:24.647
I'd like to ask you several questions, do you mind?

324
00:18:24.647 --> 00:18:28.047
No, go ahead. I'll answer if I can.

325
00:18:28.047 --> 00:18:33.347
First of all, why did you visit Mr. Takeuchi's condominium?

326
00:18:33.347 --> 00:18:37.047
I got a call from him that day.

327
00:18:37.047 --> 00:18:40.447
He said that he'd tell me the truth so to come over.

328
00:18:40.447 --> 00:18:43.847
You mean the truth about his wife?

329
00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:45.747
Or was he referring to the incident five years ago?

330
00:18:47.147 --> 00:18:49.147
You knew about it?

331
00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:52.447
You seem to have been a member of the special investigation team, right?

332
00:18:52.447 --> 00:18:53.447
Yes.

333
00:18:53.447 --> 00:18:58.447
It started off as the construction fraud of Takeuchi Construction Company.

334
00:18:58.447 --> 00:18:59.547
But there seemed to be

335
00:18:59.547 --> 00:19:03.847
a bribery case involving politicians behind the scene too,

336
00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:05.947
so I was asked to help out.

337
00:19:05.947 --> 00:19:07.647
If I remember correctly, the department head of the construction company

338
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.847
that was said to be the key to solving this case committed suicide,

339
00:19:09.847 --> 00:19:11.647
and everything was thrown into ambiguity.

340
00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:13.047
Yes.

341
00:19:13.047 --> 00:19:17.447
One of the persons working under that department head was Takeuchi.

342
00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:20.547
I see, so that's the story.

343
00:19:20.547 --> 00:19:22.847
His testimony was supposed to have served as a breakthrough

344
00:19:22.847 --> 00:19:25.247
to solving the entire case,

345
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.347
but he suddenly changed his story,

346
00:19:27.347 --> 00:19:29.947
so we had no choice but to drop charges.

347
00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:31.247
Then, he got married

348
00:19:31.247 --> 00:19:33.447
and became the son-in-law of Takeuchi Construction Company

349
00:19:33.447 --> 00:19:35.647
and became an executive.

350
00:19:35.647 --> 00:19:38.047
And now, five years later,

351
00:19:38.047 --> 00:19:40.447
that man appeared before you

352
00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:43.747
as a suspect of a hit-and-run case.

353
00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:48.047
I immediately suspected that he may have acted as a scapegoat for his wife.

354
00:19:48.047 --> 00:19:51.947
I didn't want to overlook this opportunity!

355
00:19:51.947 --> 00:19:55.647
That's why you pursued him on another case.

356
00:19:55.647 --> 00:19:57.047
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:57.047 --> 00:20:00.947
But if he called you to tell you the truth,

358
00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:03.647
why did he commit suicide by jumping off the veranda?

359
00:20:03.647 --> 00:20:06.447
I don't know either.

360
00:20:06.447 --> 00:20:08.847
It sure is strange.

361
00:20:08.847 --> 00:20:13.447
Will you tell me of how things were when he committed suicide?

362
00:20:16.247 --> 00:20:19.947
That day, at 20:00, the appointed time,

363
00:20:19.947 --> 00:20:21.947
I arrived at his condominium.

364
00:20:24.947 --> 00:20:26.047
Hold on!

365
00:20:27.147 --> 00:20:29.147
Thank you, you're a lifesaver.

366
00:20:29.147 --> 00:20:30.747
Oh, prosecutor!

367
00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:31.947
Are you going to see my husband?

368
00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:33.647
Yes, sort of.

369
00:20:33.647 --> 00:20:35.847
Are you headed home now, Mrs. Takeuchi?

370
00:20:35.847 --> 00:20:38.347
The thing is, I got a strange mail from my husband,

371
00:20:38.347 --> 00:20:40.247
so I rushed back.

372
00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:42.247
Strange mail?

373
00:20:42.247 --> 00:20:45.147
Thank you for everything you did for me so far.

374
00:20:45.147 --> 00:20:48.047
Please forget about me and find happiness.

375
00:20:48.047 --> 00:20:52.047
It sure is a strange mail.

376
00:20:54.147 --> 00:20:56.747
Dear? Where are you?

377
00:20:56.747 --> 00:20:59.047
Dear?

378
00:20:59.047 --> 00:21:01.347
Dear? What're you doing there?

379
00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:03.047
Please, don't!

380
00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:05.047
Prosecutor, please stop my husband!

381
00:21:05.047 --> 00:21:06.447
Excuse me!

382
00:21:09.347 --> 00:21:11.047
My husband is out on the veranda!

383
00:21:15.747 --> 00:21:18.447
Mr. Takeuchi! Just what do you think you're doing?

384
00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:23.447
Mr. Takeuchi!

385
00:21:27.947 --> 00:21:30.747
Oh, no.

386
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:32.247
Dear!

387
00:21:42.247 --> 00:21:43.647
It's strange

388
00:21:43.647 --> 00:21:45.347
for him to commit suicide after calling the prosecutor

389
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:48.147
that's investigating him to come and see him.

390
00:21:48.147 --> 00:21:49.947
Something's not right.

391
00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:22.147
"The deceased, Takeshi Nezu"

392
00:22:22.147 --> 00:22:24.147
"Third anniversary of my husband's death will be held on November 27th."

393
00:22:24.147 --> 00:22:25.147
"Please drop in on me if you come around. - Kayoko Nezu"

394
00:22:29.847 --> 00:22:32.147
"Take care of yourself. I hope you'll do a good job."

395
00:22:32.147 --> 00:22:33.747
"Your former boss, Takeshi Nezu."

396
00:22:38.747 --> 00:22:40.847
"Espa"

397
00:22:40.847 --> 00:22:42.847
But really,

398
00:22:42.847 --> 00:22:46.547
I still can't believe that Mr. Takeuchi committed suicide.

399
00:22:46.547 --> 00:22:48.647
He jumped from the veranda right

400
00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:51.847
in front of the eyes of his wife and the prosecutor,

401
00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:53.447
so there's no doubt.

402
00:22:53.447 --> 00:22:55.047
But,

403
00:22:55.047 --> 00:22:57.747
he came here the night before he died

404
00:22:57.747 --> 00:23:00.447
and was drinking in a very good mood.

405
00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:02.147
In a very good mood?

406
00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:03.147
Yes.

407
00:23:03.147 --> 00:23:05.647
He was saying that he'd be a free man soon,

408
00:23:05.647 --> 00:23:08.247
so maybe he'd take a trip abroad.

409
00:23:08.247 --> 00:23:09.847
I mean he was just out on bail,

410
00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:12.447
and his trial was still to come.

411
00:23:12.447 --> 00:23:13.947
I said the same thing to him,

412
00:23:13.947 --> 00:23:16.647
but he said the trial was no problem.

413
00:23:16.647 --> 00:23:20.147
He was more concerned about getting a divorce and starting over again.

414
00:23:20.147 --> 00:23:21.947
Unthinkable.

415
00:23:21.947 --> 00:23:23.647
He supposedly loved her so much

416
00:23:23.647 --> 00:23:26.247
that he turned himself in to the police as her scapegoat.

417
00:23:26.247 --> 00:23:30.847
But he seems to have had arrangements for a divorce ready.

418
00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:33.147
What's going on?

419
00:23:37.147 --> 00:23:39.047
Something's fishy after all.

420
00:23:39.047 --> 00:23:41.847
Why is Mr. Takeuchi dressed like this?

421
00:23:41.847 --> 00:23:44.447
Besides, what is this...

422
00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:46.647
Hey, Glasses Kid!

423
00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:50.147
How dare you read somebody else's stuff again without permission?

424
00:23:50.147 --> 00:23:54.747
I wonder why Mr. Takeuchi was dressed like this when he died?

425
00:23:56.147 --> 00:23:58.947
Because why would a person who is planning to die

426
00:23:58.947 --> 00:24:02.747
wear a suit as if he were going to go out?

427
00:24:02.747 --> 00:24:04.947
He was planning to take a death dive journey,

428
00:24:04.947 --> 00:24:06.847
so maybe that's why he wore a suit top.

429
00:24:06.847 --> 00:24:09.247
But, his pants are jeans.

430
00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:13.947
Maybe he was delirious before taking his death dive.

431
00:24:13.947 --> 00:24:17.947
Besides, by the stomach part and both knee parts of his clothes,

432
00:24:17.947 --> 00:24:20.847
there is a mark that looks to be like something scraped against it.

433
00:24:20.847 --> 00:24:22.847
I wonder what it is.

434
00:24:28.247 --> 00:24:30.147
What do you think it is?

435
00:24:31.847 --> 00:24:34.747
Something's strange about Mr. Takeuchi's suicide.

436
00:24:34.747 --> 00:24:35.847
Who cares!

437
00:24:35.847 --> 00:24:37.647
Keep your nose out of the business of adults!

438
00:24:37.647 --> 00:24:38.647
Ouch!

439
00:24:40.947 --> 00:24:43.747
But you borrowed the autopsy report

440
00:24:43.747 --> 00:24:46.347
because you had your doubts too, right, Pops?

441
00:24:46.347 --> 00:24:48.447
Shut up!

442
00:24:48.447 --> 00:24:49.847
Dad, where are you going?

443
00:24:49.847 --> 00:24:50.947
Pachinko!

444
00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:52.247
Hey, Dad!

445
00:24:52.247 --> 00:24:54.647
What about the investigation?

446
00:25:02.847 --> 00:25:04.847
Bricks are nowhere in sight.

447
00:25:04.847 --> 00:25:06.747
Hey, Kid.

448
00:25:06.747 --> 00:25:09.247
Remember? It was on the autopsy report.

449
00:25:09.247 --> 00:25:10.747
There is a trace of a bruise on the back of his head

450
00:25:10.747 --> 00:25:12.247
that seems to have been caused by hitting a brick.

451
00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:14.047
I tell you, take a good look, will you?

452
00:25:14.047 --> 00:25:16.547
By the mark of the body near his head,

453
00:25:16.547 --> 00:25:19.847
there are plants surrounded by bricks.

454
00:25:19.847 --> 00:25:22.247
But, if he hit the brick there,

455
00:25:22.247 --> 00:25:23.847
wouldn't the plant be broken off too?

456
00:25:23.847 --> 00:25:26.347
And the brick would be shattered too, wouldn't it?

457
00:25:26.347 --> 00:25:28.347
He came falling from the sixth floor...

458
00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:33.547
What on earth...

459
00:25:34.547 --> 00:25:36.447
She says that she cannot bear living in the room

460
00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:37.847
that she was living together with her husband in,

461
00:25:37.847 --> 00:25:40.247
and has gone back to her parent's home.

462
00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:41.847
It seems that she's going to be putting it out for sale.

463
00:25:41.847 --> 00:25:43.147
Hey, Kid!

464
00:25:44.447 --> 00:25:45.447
Okay, Mr. Mouri,

465
00:25:45.447 --> 00:25:48.447
please return the key to the manager's office on your way home.

466
00:25:48.447 --> 00:25:49.747
All right.

467
00:25:51.647 --> 00:25:53.447
It's here, after all.

468
00:25:54.447 --> 00:25:56.947
I wonder why this antenna is faced downward.

469
00:25:56.947 --> 00:26:00.147
So, this is the veranda in question.

470
00:26:00.147 --> 00:26:02.047
He jumped from here?

471
00:26:02.047 --> 00:26:03.547
Where's the brick?

472
00:26:10.747 --> 00:26:12.147
Soil.

473
00:26:12.147 --> 00:26:14.947
I get it! It was probably switched

474
00:26:14.947 --> 00:26:17.847
with the bricks where the plants were.

475
00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:22.847
All that's left to figure out is how he was made to dive to his death

476
00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:25.347
in front of Prosecutor Kujo's very eyes.

477
00:26:28.447 --> 00:26:29.447
I get it!

478
00:26:30.947 --> 00:26:33.247
Where? Where is it?

479
00:26:33.247 --> 00:26:35.247
Was it already gotten rid of?

480
00:26:35.247 --> 00:26:36.847
Darn.

481
00:26:39.547 --> 00:26:40.947
I found it.

482
00:26:42.147 --> 00:26:44.047
I've figured out

483
00:26:44.047 --> 00:26:47.447
why the corpse was wearing the top of a suit,

484
00:26:47.447 --> 00:26:51.647
why there were scrape marks by the stomach part and both knee parts,

485
00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:54.247
as well as why the antenna was faced downwards

486
00:26:54.247 --> 00:26:57.047
and why the metal was stretched out.

487
00:26:57.047 --> 00:27:00.047
This is a murder case!
