1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,492
It says here that on the day the incident occurred,

2
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:10,294
after work, you stopped over

3
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:12,963
at a pub on Suehiro Avenue called Espa,

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:15,666
and drank beer along with 180 cc of sake,

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,669
then left the pub at around 20:00.

6
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,370
Is this correct?

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,472
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:23,474
At the Toriyacho intersection,

9
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,176
a little after 23:00, you hit the victim,

10
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,178
who was on his way home with your car.

11
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:31,782
Where and what were you doing during this time?

12
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,585
I figured I should cool off a bit before going home,

13
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:37,988
so I took a rest in the car, and fell asleep.

14
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:40,891
Is there anyone who can testify this for you?

15
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,192
No.

16
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,894
Why did you flee from the scene of the accident

17
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,364
instead of helping the victim right away?

18
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:49,266
I got so upset...

19
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:52,069
that I...

20
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:54,171
Is that really the only reason?

21
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,878
Ten days have already gone by

22
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,779
since you've been detained,

23
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:06,783
but is the prosecutor asking you every day?

24
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:12,689
Ms. Kujo, the prosecutor in charge is an able woman.

25
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,393
She would never detain anyone for 10 days without reason.

26
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:21,164
I'm on your side.

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,666
So, even if it is something disadvantageous to you,

28
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,468
please be honest with me.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,681
Ms. Kisaki.

30
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,384
Have you come to talk to the suspect?

31
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,186
Yes, sort of...

32
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,288
Great timing, Ms. Kujo.

33
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,089
I'd like to talk to you.

34
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,891
What is it?

35
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,893
It's been a while since Mr. Takeuchi's detained,

36
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:54,164
so I'd like to ask you to release him. Isn't it about time?

37
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:55,966
He turned himself in,

38
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,769
and since he's already admitted to committing the crime,

39
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,872
is there any further reason you should keep him detained?

40
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,774
I hate to put it this way,

41
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:09,379
but I'd like that judgment to be left up to me.

42
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,181
Then, I'll submit a request for you

43
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:13,784
to make public the reason for his detention.

44
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:16,086
Please go ahead and do what you must.

45
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:18,088
If you will excuse me, goodbye.

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,392
What are you after, Prosecutor Kujo?

47
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:28,165
Only to bring the truth to light.

48
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:31,068
It's so unlike you, Ms. Kujo.

49
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,769
I'll see you in court.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,881
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

51
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,084
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

52
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,785
Two sizzling hot rivals.

53
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,687
Attorney At Law, Kisaki,

54
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:51,989
confronts a competent prosecutor in court.

55
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,690
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,092
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,994
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,047
"Confrontation in Court III".

59
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,150
"Prosecutor is Witness".

60
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,857
Really, why do I have to do something like this?

61
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,461
But this job is what you asked mom to do, isn't it?

62
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,763
I only asked her because the woman owner of a shop that I frequent

63
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,066
asked me if I knew a good lawyer.

64
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,768
I hear that prosecutor Kujo was hiding

65
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,970
the fact that she was in charge of the case.

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,973
It's a simple case, in which all that's left to do now

67
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,677
is to lighten the sentence as much as possible

68
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,445
after pleading extenuating circumstances.

69
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,948
It doesn't matter who the prosecutor is!

70
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,649
Just as Pops says

71
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,953
there should be no room for a confrontation in court.

72
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,856
I wonder what Prosecutor Kujo is after.

73
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,059
"Toriya Police Station"

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,063
Thank you for coming from so far away.

75
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,666
This is the car that had the accident.

76
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,468
If I remember correctly, the victim was on a bicycle.

77
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,871
Yes, sir. According to an eye-witness,

78
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,972
the car ran the red light

79
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,975
and hit the bicycle upon entering the intersection.

80
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,476
From the traces left behind,

81
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,078
it is thought that the driver was going

82
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,147
at a speed of almost 60 kilometers.

83
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,149
How terrible.

84
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,450
Hey, Kid.

85
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,352
Don't go touching the evidence.

86
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,553
Pops.

87
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,756
How tall was the man called Takeuchi?

88
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,658
How tall?

89
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,462
I think he was a bit taller than me.

90
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,466
Then, I wonder if someone else drove the car after the accident?

91
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,867
Don't be silly.

92
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,769
There's no way that anyone could've driven the car

93
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,671
after such an accident.

94
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,873
But look at this seat.

95
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,345
See, the seat is pushed a lot to the front, right?

96
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,149
I think it would even be hard for you to drive this way, Pops.

97
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,453
True. Maybe it's just about right for me.

98
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,755
When you confiscated this car,

99
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,157
did a women officer drive it?

100
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,459
No way!

101
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,562
We would never drive a vehicle that serves as evidence.

102
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,464
We brought this car here from the condo of the suspect

103
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,866
using a tow truck.

104
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,669
Then, maybe the forensic officers moved the seat forward

105
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,671
when they inspected it.

106
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,374
No, the forensic officer didn't move the seat either.

107
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,878
I'm sure because Prosecutor Kujo was very careful

108
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,646
about confirming that point too.

109
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,948
Madonna was?

110
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,549
Yes, that's right.

111
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,852
I mean she was so very persistent.

112
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,560
Just as the bicycle was about to cross the intersection

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,763
the car rammed into the bicycle.

114
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,365
And, where were you at that time?

115
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,766
I was stopped at the traffic signal at this corner here

116
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,769
waiting for the light to change.

117
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,948
Oh, no.

118
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,151
Since the driver screeched to a stop,

119
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,353
I thought he was going to come out of the car to help the victim,

120
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,555
but he just hit and ran.

121
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,557
And, did you see the driver's face?

122
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,559
No, because it was dark,

123
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,761
and he didn't come out of the car.

124
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,163
I see.

125
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,265
Sir?

126
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,267
Wasn't the driver

127
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,569
a very small person?

128
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,771
Sonny, how did you know...

129
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,772
Well?

130
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,975
Yes, the prosecutor asked me the same question too.

131
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,578
However, since the driver didn't come out of the car,

132
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,747
I couldn't tell how tall the driver was, or if it was a man or a woman.

133
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,848
Hey, wait up!

134
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,650
What do you mean it was a woman?

135
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,752
The one who turned himself in is a man!

136
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,855
I know because I read the papers.

137
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,157
I thought that was a queer question to ask me.

138
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,359
And, what did you answer, Sir?

139
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,562
So, like I said, I didn't see the driver,

140
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,963
so I couldn't answer.

141
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,464
I guess not.

142
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,367
And, was there anything else you noticed?

143
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,171
Well, something I noticed...

144
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,347
That's right, when the culprit fled

145
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,649
something glistened around here.

146
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,251
Not glasses?

147
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,855
No, it had more glitter.

148
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,756
Accessory?

149
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,265
-We're home! -We're home!

150
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,268
You're back, Ran and Conan.

151
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,669
Either way, we'll just have to

152
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,073
wait and see what the prosecutor has to say.

153
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,875
I'll pay you a good sum,

154
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,477
so please just see to it that everything turns out okay.

155
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,848
Your husband seems to be exhausted too,

156
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,752
so please go see him as much as you can.

157
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,555
I'm busy with work, you see.

158
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,856
Goodbye.

159
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,766
You say that the driver of the car that got into the accident

160
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,968
may have been a woman?

161
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:29,969
It seems that Prosecutor Kujo was

162
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,872
asking the taxi driver whether the driver of the car was a woman.

163
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,075
Is she saying that my client is lying?

164
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,978
Maybe he's a scapegoat.

165
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,347
A hit-and run is a serious crime.

166
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,849
It's not possible that someone would act as a scapegoat.

167
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,551
Don't tell me he's doing it for his wife?

168
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,656
The seat of the car would be a perfect fit for his wife's height.

169
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,458
Maybe Prosecutor Kujo is not releasing him

170
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,560
because that's what she's after?

171
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,866
Ms. Kuriyama.

172
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,769
Mrs. Takeuchi said that she was busy with work,

173
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,470
but what does she do?

174
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,875
Something about she succeeded her father who passed away last year,

175
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,678
and is now the president of her father's company.

176
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,846
His wife is of a higher rank than he is.

177
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,448
Yes, but I don't think

178
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,849
he'll act as a scapegoat in a hit-and-run case

179
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,651
unless he has a good reason.

180
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,752
Ms. Kuriyama.

181
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,953
Yes.

182
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,355
Will you call the investigation company

183
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,357
and gather the staff immediately?

184
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,959
We need to redo the investigation.

185
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,261
Okay!

186
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:35,068
This case doesn't seem to be a mere hit-and-run incident.

187
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:04,555
Ms. Kujo?

188
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:07,024
May I have a moment with you?

189
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:10,828
Please wait ten minutes

190
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,930
because I have two more kilometers to go.

191
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,233
Okay, I'll be at the lounge downstairs.

192
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,035
All right.

193
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,042
I'm sorry to intrude on you during your lunch break.

194
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,744
No problem.

195
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:30,147
So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?

196
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,749
Well, you see.

197
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,151
Let me get straight to the point, then.

198
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,954
Please release Mr. Takeuchi right now!

199
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:41,025
You're not after Mr. Takeuchi,

200
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,527
but rather his wife, aren't you?

201
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,929
Just what are you doing?

202
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,933
Doing something similar to arresting someone on a holding charge.

203
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,636
Or do you have something else in mind?

204
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,340
Okay.

205
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,242
I'll approve his release.

206
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,443
Huh?

207
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,245
Bye, then, I have a case to attend to.

208
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,447
Hey, Ms. Kujo!

209
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:04,748
Ms. Kujo?

210
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,124
-Huh? -He was released?

211
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:16,326
Yes, just a while ago.

212
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:18,328
He's talking to Ms. Kisaki now.

213
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,334
At least now you've been released.

214
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,937
But the tough part has just begun.

215
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:29,940
If you really need my help,

216
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,443
please tell me the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

217
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:35,245
I've told you the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

218
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:36,547
Ms. Kisaki.

219
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,351
Well,

220
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:44,354
I guess I'll go get myself a good drink, since it's been a while.

221
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:46,323
-Mr. Takeuchi. -Huh?

222
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:49,927
Didn't you turn yourself in as a scapegoat for your wife?

223
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:53,530
Why'd you do such a stupid thing?

224
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,933
No, I did it.

225
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,235
Don't lie to me!

226
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,537
Do you have proof or something?

227
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,940
The prosecution is investigating on that line too.

228
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,643
If they have evidence, she should've been arrested long ago.

229
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:10,047
Do you think something like that would work for Prosecutor Kujo?

230
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,150
If it's about that woman prosecutor,

231
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,952
I know her very well.

232
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,454
Just what do you mean?

233
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,823
At any rate, I'm counting on you.

234
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,824
Wait!

235
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:21,925
Shoots!

236
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,935
Not too good, Kid.

237
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:34,438
Eavesdropping is a crime.

238
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,340
Bye, then.

239
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,344
He knew about Prosecutor Kujo to begin with?

240
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,635
What?

241
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,337
You have a phone call from suspect Takeuchi,

242
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,338
what would you like to do?

243
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,142
Okay, I'll take it.

244
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,343
Number 3.

245
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,247
Hello. This is Kujo.

246
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,053
"Mouri Detective Agency"

247
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,328
"Takeuchi Construction Company Subject of Construction Scandal"

248
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,330
I found it, here it is!

249
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,132
What're you looking at, Conan?

250
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:37,234
Mr. Takeuchi's company

251
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:41,538
was scandalized for shoddy construction five years ago, wasn't it?

252
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,540
I wonder is that really true.

253
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,242
Yeah.

254
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:46,643
It was supposed to have evolved into

255
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:49,746
a case involving the political world too,

256
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,848
but the department head of the subsidiary design company

257
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:53,951
committed suicide and all vanished into smoke.

258
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,052
As a result, it seems that the senior prosecutor

259
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:57,754
was flown over to a remote district.

260
00:14:57,754 --> 00:14:59,656
What about it?

261
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:02,926
Maybe it has nothing to do with what's happening now,

262
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:07,331
but I was just wondering around when Mr. Takeuchi got to know Ms. Kujo.

263
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:11,435
What? Takeuchi and Madonna knew each other from before?

264
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,638
Yes, he said so, at Ms. Kisaki's place.

265
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:17,641
He says he knows a lot about Prosecutor Kujo.

266
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:21,345
I haven't heard he's been arrested before, though.

267
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:23,046
Hey, Pops.

268
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:26,450
I watch a lot of news like these on TV

269
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,952
but doesn't the special investigation department handle cases like these?

270
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:29,953
I see!

271
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:33,056
If Madonna was in that special investigation department

272
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:37,828
and if Takeuchi was involved in the case...

273
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:41,031
Maybe there's something behind all this.

274
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:47,838
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

275
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:50,841
Oh, Ms. Kuriyama.

276
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,342
Yes, he's here.

277
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,745
Dad, it's from Ms. Kuriyama.

278
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,146
She says it's an emergency.

279
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:00,050
What's up?

280
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,552
What? Takeuchi died?

281
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,354
Just what do you mean?

282
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:06,823
How'd he die?

283
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,538
Ms. Kisaki, Mr. Mouri is...

284
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:22,940
Dear.

285
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,242
Hey, what's going on?

286
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:27,244
Is it true that Takeuchi died?

287
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:28,345
Yes.

288
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:32,950
He jumped off the veranda of his room on the sixth floor of this condo.

289
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,052
He seems to have died instantly.

290
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,553
He jumped?

291
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:37,654
You mean he committed suicide?

292
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:38,855
It seems to be so.

293
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:39,923
Absurd!

294
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,025
He was finally released and yet!

295
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:43,927
I realized that too!

296
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:46,229
I'm confused myself.

297
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:48,432
Isn't there a possibility that it was an accident?

298
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:49,833
No, there isn't.

299
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,035
They even found a will.

300
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:54,938
Moreover, there's an eye-witness.

301
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,540
An eye-witness?

302
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:03,647
Don't tell me that...

00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,214

00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,022

You don't have your car, do you?

306
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:25,427
No, thanks. I'll hail a cab.

307
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,000
Ms. Kujo.

308
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:35,303

Get out of here this minute!

316
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,109
He died because of you!

00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,813
I'm sorry, Prosecutor.

320
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:20,515
Will you please leave?

321
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:22,417
Please, at least let me offer him incense.

322
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,219
Ms. Kujo.

323
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,222
Why not leave for today?

324
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:30,525

Come now, I'll give you a lift home.

I'd like to ask you something too.

327
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,603
Thank you very much.

328
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,706
I'd like to ask you several questions, do you mind?

329
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,109
No, go ahead. I'll answer if I can.

330
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:53,415
First of all, why did you visit Mr. Takeuchi's condominium?

331
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:57,118
I got a call from him that day.

332
00:18:57,118 --> 00:19:00,522
He said that he'd tell me the truth so to come over.

333
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,925
You mean the truth about his wife?

334
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,827
Or was he referring to the incident five years ago?

335
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,231
You knew about it?

336
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,500
You seem to have been a member of the special investigation team, right?

337
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,501
Yes.

338
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:18,506
It started off as the construction fraud of Takeuchi Construction Company.

339
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,608
But there seemed to be

340
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:23,912
a bribery case involving politicians behind the scene too,

341
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,014
so I was asked to help out.

342
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,716
If I remember correctly, the department head of the construction company

343
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,918
that was said to be the key to solving this case committed suicide,

344
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,720
and everything was thrown into ambiguity.

345
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,121
Yes.

346
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:37,525
One of the persons working under that department head was Takeuchi.

347
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,629
I see, so that's the story.

348
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:42,931
His testimony was supposed to have served as a breakthrough

349
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,300
to solving the entire case,

350
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,402
but he suddenly changed his story,

351
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:50,005
so we had no choice but to drop charges.

352
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,306
Then, he got married

353
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,508
and became the son-in-law of Takeuchi Construction Company

354
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,710
and became an executive.

355
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,113
And now, five years later,

356
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,515
that man appeared before you

357
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:03,818
as a suspect of a hit-and-run case.

358
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:08,123
I immediately suspected that he may have acted as a scapegoat for his wife.

359
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:12,027
I didn't want to overlook this opportunity!

360
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,730
That's why you pursued him on another case.

361
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,132
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:21,002
But if he called you to tell you the truth,

363
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,705
why did he commit suicide by jumping off the veranda?

364
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,508
I don't know either.

365
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,910
It sure is strange.

366
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,515
Will you tell me of how things were when he committed suicide?

367
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,021
That day, at 20:00, the appointed time,

368
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,023
I arrived at his condominium.

369
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,127
Hold on!

370
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,230
Thank you, you're a lifesaver.

371
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,832
Oh, prosecutor!

372
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,033
Are you going to see my husband?

373
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,702
Yes, sort of.

374
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,904
Are you headed home now, Mrs. Takeuchi?

375
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,406
The thing is, I got a strange mail from my husband,

376
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:00,308
so I rushed back.

377
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:02,310
Strange mail?

378
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,213
Thank you for everything you did for me so far.

379
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:08,116
Please forget about me and find happiness.

380
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:12,120
It sure is a strange mail.

381
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,825
Dear? Where are you?

382
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,127
Dear?

383
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,429
Dear? What're you doing there?

384
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,131
Please, don't!

385
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,133
Prosecutor, please stop my husband!

386
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,501
Excuse me!

387
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,106
My husband is out on the veranda!

388
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,513
Mr. Takeuchi! Just what do you think you're doing?

389
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,518
Mr. Takeuchi!

390
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:50,825
Oh, no.

391
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,327
Dear!

392
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:03,705
It's strange

393
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:05,406
for him to commit suicide after calling the prosecutor

394
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:08,209
that's investigating him to come and see him.

395
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,011
Something's not right.

396
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,210
"The deceased, Takeshi Nezu"

397
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,212
"Third anniversary of my husband's death will be held on November 27th."

398
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,213
"Please drop in on me if you come around. - Kayoko Nezu"

399
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,220
"Take care of yourself. I hope you'll do a good job."

400
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,822
"Your former boss, Takeshi Nezu."

401
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,929
"Espa"

402
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,931
But really,

403
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:06,601
I still can't believe that Mr. Takeuchi committed suicide.

404
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,703
He jumped from the veranda right

405
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:11,906
in front of the eyes of his wife and the prosecutor,

406
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:13,508
so there's no doubt.

407
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,109
But,

408
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,812
he came here the night before he died

409
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:20,515
and was drinking in a very good mood.

410
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,217
In a very good mood?

411
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,218
Yes.

412
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:25,720
He was saying that he'd be a free man soon,

413
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,323
so maybe he'd take a trip abroad.

414
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,924
I mean he was just out on bail,

415
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:32,527
and his trial was still to come.

416
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,028
I said the same thing to him,

417
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:36,731
but he said the trial was no problem.

418
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:40,201
He was more concerned about getting a divorce and starting over again.

419
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:42,003
Unthinkable.

420
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,705
He supposedly loved her so much

421
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:46,307
that he turned himself in to the police as her scapegoat.

422
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:50,912
But he seems to have had arrangements for a divorce ready.

423
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:53,214
What's going on?

424
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,120
Something's fishy after all.

425
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,923
Why is Mr. Takeuchi dressed like this?

426
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,525
Besides, what is this...

427
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,728
Hey, Glasses Kid!

428
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:10,231
How dare you read somebody else's stuff again without permission?

429
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:14,802
I wonder why Mr. Takeuchi was dressed like this when he died?

430
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,007
Because why would a person who is planning to die

431
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,810
wear a suit as if he were going to go out?

432
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,013
He was planning to take a death dive journey,

433
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,915
so maybe that's why he wore a suit top.

434
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:29,317
But, his pants are jeans.

435
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:34,022
Maybe he was delirious before taking his death dive.

436
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:38,026
Besides, by the stomach part and both knee parts of his clothes,

437
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:40,929
there is a mark that looks to be like something scraped against it.

438
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,931
I wonder what it is.

439
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,204
What do you think it is?

440
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,809
Something's strange about Mr. Takeuchi's suicide.

441
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:55,910
Who cares!

442
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,712
Keep your nose out of the business of adults!

443
00:24:57,712 --> 00:24:58,713
Ouch!

444
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,818
But you borrowed the autopsy report

445
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:06,421
because you had your doubts too, right, Pops?

446
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,523
Shut up!

447
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:09,924
Dad, where are you going?

448
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:11,025
Pachinko!

449
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:12,327
Hey, Dad!

450
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,729
What about the investigation?

451
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,906
Bricks are nowhere in sight.

452
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,808
Hey, Kid.

453
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:29,310
Remember? It was on the autopsy report.

454
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,812
There is a trace of a bruise on the back of his head

455
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,313
that seems to have been caused by hitting a brick.

456
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,115
I tell you, take a good look, will you?

457
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,618
By the mark of the body near his head,

458
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,921
there are plants surrounded by bricks.

459
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,323
But, if he hit the brick there,

460
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,925
wouldn't the plant be broken off too?

461
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:46,427
And the brick would be shattered too, wouldn't it?

462
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:48,429
He came falling from the sixth floor...

463
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,601
What on earth...

464
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:56,504
She says that she cannot bear living in the room

465
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:57,905
that she was living together with her husband in,

466
00:25:57,905 --> 00:26:00,308
and has gone back to her parent's home.

467
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,909
It seems that she's going to be putting it out for sale.

468
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:03,211
Hey, Kid!

469
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:05,513
Okay, Mr. Mouri,

470
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:08,516
please return the key to the manager's office on your way home.

471
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:09,817
All right.

472
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,521
It's here, after all.

473
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:17,025
I wonder why this antenna is faced downward.

474
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:20,228
So, this is the veranda in question.

475
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,130
He jumped from here?

476
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,631
Where's the brick?

477
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,206
Soil.

478
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:35,009
I get it! It was probably switched

479
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:37,912
with the bricks where the plants were.

480
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:42,917
All that's left to figure out is how he was made to dive to his death

481
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,420
in front of Prosecutor Kujo's very eyes.

482
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,524
I get it!

483
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:53,327
Where? Where is it?

484
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:55,329
Was it already gotten rid of?

485
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:56,931
Darn.

486
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,002
I found it.

487
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,105
I've figured out

488
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:07,508
why the corpse was wearing the top of a suit,

489
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:11,712
why there were scrape marks by the stomach part and both knee parts,

490
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:14,315
as well as why the antenna was faced downwards

491
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:17,118
and why the metal was stretched out.

492
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:20,121
This is a murder case!
