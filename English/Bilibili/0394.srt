1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.340
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.140
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.440
The Youth Detective Squad goes through great adventure

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.440
at an eccentric mansion of tricks. Off we go after the treasure!

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.025
Mountains are for men.

9
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:14.825
Genta, come on and get to work.

10
00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:19.125
Please help us collect firewood!

11
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.225
Huh? I'm not slacking off!

12
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.325
I already have a lot.

13
00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:24.325
Look.

14
00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:28.725
That's far from enough, Genta!

15
00:02:29.725 --> 00:02:32.025
I see.

16
00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:34.225
But why isn't Conan here?

17
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.125
Not again.

18
00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:40.225
Like I told you just a while ago.

19
00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:49.525
Did you catch a cold?

20
00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:50.725
No.

21
00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:53.625
Shinichi.

22
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.025
What were we talking about?

23
00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.625
I shouldn't have asked him.

24
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.125
A song? The "Seven Baby Crows".

25
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.025
The "Seven Baby Crows", right?

26
00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:04.125
Yes, I know the song.

27
00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:11.225
"Crow, oh crow, why do you cry..."

28
00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:12.825
That's the song, right?

29
00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.025
Yes, that's the one.

30
00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:18.225
I used to sing it a lot on my way home from school.

31
00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:20.325
And? What about it?

32
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.925
Is it your music homework or something?

33
00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:24.025
No!

34
00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.725
Remember the number I mentioned the other day?

35
00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:29.425
When I use my cell phone and hit the buttons rhythmically,

36
00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.825
it sounds like the beginning part of that song, right?

37
00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.425
0858.

38
00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:35.425
"Crow, oh crow..."

39
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:37.825
Let me see.

40
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.425
True.

41
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.725
It finally came back to me.

42
00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:54.025
Back then, when Bellmot was sending mail to the boss,

43
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:58.525
I felt somewhat sad and nostalgic.

44
00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:00.325
But it wasn't the expression on her face that made me feel that way.

45
00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:03.525
It was the sound of the buttons she was pushing.

46
00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:07.825
What? Then are you saying that the mail address of their boss

47
00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.125
is the "Seven Baby Crows"?

48
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.825
It can't be.

49
00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:18.825
Why would the boss use a children's song for his mail address?

50
00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:23.425
What if they remembered the address by the melody?

51
00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:25.425
By the melody?

52
00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:26.525
Yes.

53
00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:31.425
Then they wouldn't have to register the mail address inside their phone.

54
00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:33.525
Which makes it safe for a variety of reasons, right?

55
00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:39.325
0858 may sound like "Crow, oh crow", but...

56
00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:44.825
"Why do you cry" is not so easy.

57
00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:49.525
Well, it's true that it's not all that accurate,

58
00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:52.425
but if we make do with the slight difference in sound...

59
00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:55.125
and put it together.

60
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.325
It comes out like this.

61
00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:03.525
This is the mail address of the boss of the Black Organization.

62
00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:06.225
What?

63
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.625
I quite sure it is.

64
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:14.325
Hey, don't tell me you sent mail there?

65
00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:18.725
Why would I do something so stupid as to let them know where we are?

66
00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:19.925
I guess so.

67
00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:21.525
You scared me out of my wits.

68
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.425
Well, if I'm going to send mail out,

69
00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:27.225
it'll be after I tell Officer Takagi of the circumstances.

70
00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:28.625
They'll annihilate him.

71
00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:31.825
Officer Takagi.

72
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:34.725
At the point that he tries to specify who the boss is,

73
00:05:34.725 --> 00:05:37.225
they'll kill him with their very hands.

74
00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:40.825
Then, their target will turn to the one who provided the mail address,

75
00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:42.525
that is you, Kudo.

76
00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:45.225
Not only Officer Takagi,

77
00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:46.425
but the police should also be notified

78
00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:47.825
after we explain the situation to them.

79
00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:50.525
We should face the organization prepared.

80
00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:51.825
Impossible.

81
00:05:51.825 --> 00:05:54.325
If right after that incident, maybe,

82
00:05:54.325 --> 00:05:58.125
but now that it's been closed as a mere kidnap case.

83
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.725
Aside from Officer Takagi who might believe a story like that,

84
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:04.125
it's unthinkable that anyone else will.

85
00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.825
Yes. In order to get the police to make a move,

86
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:11.725
we needed that mail address at that time.

87
00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:16.525
I mean somebody unthinkable may emerge after all, you know.

88
00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:18.725
Someone unthinkable?

89
00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:20.025
Don't tell me...

90
00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.025
You know who it is?

91
00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:27.025
Don't tell me you know their mail address or who the boss is?

92
00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:29.025
I wonder?

93
00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.625
But what a waste that we can't do a thing about it,

94
00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:39.025
despite having found the boss' mail address.

95
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:41.725
Well, it's best you give up

96
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:42.925
and forget about it.

97
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:48.725
You should never open that mail address.

98
00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:52.425
It's Pandora's Box.

99
00:06:55.925 --> 00:07:01.625
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Lock In"

100
00:07:03.225 --> 00:07:04.725
What did you just say?

101
00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.125
What's this? What's this about a panda's box?

102
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:09.825
Tell us, Conan.

103
00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:11.725
Treasure?

104
00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:15.425
Don't tell me there's a panda inside?

105
00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:17.925
No, Ayumi.

106
00:07:17.925 --> 00:07:21.725
It is a story in Greek mythology,

107
00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:23.825
in which God gives a box filled with evils and disasters that exist,

108
00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:26.725
to a woman called Pandora,

109
00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:29.725
and tells her never to open it.

110
00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:32.025
But the more somebody tells you not to open something,

111
00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:34.825
the more it makes you want to open it, right?

112
00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:36.725
Come on, Genta.

113
00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:37.825
Right.

114
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:41.025
Pandora went against God's words and opened the box,

115
00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:45.025
which brought about evil and disaster into this world.

116
00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:46.525
That's how the story went, right?

117
00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:48.025
Yes.

118
00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:50.925
And what about that panda's box?

119
00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:51.925
-Right, right! -Right, right!

120
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:55.225
It's nothing.

121
00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:59.625
Talking about box, while we were picking up firewood,

122
00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:02.325
we found a strange looking stone box.

123
00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:03.425
Yes!

124
00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:05.725
A stone box?

125
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:07.425
What is that?

126
00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:12.625
Yes. A stone that looks like an old box with a hole in two places.

127
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:16.425
When we looked inside through the hole, it was full of words.

128
00:08:17.725 --> 00:08:22.125
Something about a God's stone this and that was what written inside.

129
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:24.025
There were many difficult kanji characters written inside.

130
00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.525
-So we couldn't read it. -Exactly.

131
00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:27.725
Hey.

132
00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:30.725
Will you take me to where you found that stone box?

133
00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:33.225
Yes.

134
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:40.625
This way. This way. It's this way.

135
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.225
This way. This way.

136
00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:49.125
It's this way.

137
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.625
You don't need to run.

138
00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:53.525
Hey!

139
00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.325
That's right.

140
00:08:56.725 --> 00:09:01.425
How far did you guys go pick up firewood anyway?

141
00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:05.025
See, over there.

142
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:06.025
Right!

143
00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:19.925
I didn't know there was such a mansion in a place like this.

144
00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:22.025
After taking another good look at it...

145
00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:23.925
It sure is beat up.

146
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:27.225
Oh, my.

147
00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:30.725
This is really a dilapidated building.

148
00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:40.625
It kind of looks creepy.

149
00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.925
You can say that again.

150
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:47.525
It seems to have been left unused for quite a number of years.

151
00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.525
This place is...

152
00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:58.725
Conan!

153
00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:00.625
Over here! This way!

154
00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:19.325
This is the stone box that you've been wanting to see, Conan.

155
00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:25.125
We were looking into this swamp and found this box sunk at the bottom...

156
00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:29.625
and a carp was lost inside it!

157
00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:34.025
We tried to catch the carp and pulled the box up,

158
00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:36.625
and noticed the words inside it.

159
00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.525
The carp got away though.

160
00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:44.925
Isn't this a stone garden lantern?

161
00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:47.425
What? Stone garden lantern?

162
00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:51.725
The kind you see a lot in Japanese gardens.

163
00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:55.225
A lantern made of stone, you know.

164
00:10:56.925 --> 00:11:01.625
This is probably the fire pouch in the middle where you place the candle.

165
00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:05.925
Now that you mentioned it, it does look that way.

166
00:11:05.925 --> 00:11:07.025
But if it is really so,

167
00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:10.225
the covering and the base should also be on the ground somewhere.

168
00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:14.325
It is on the ground.

169
00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:16.025
Inside the swamp.

170
00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:18.825
And it's not like just one or two.

171
00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:23.825
True!

172
00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:27.125
We were so absorbed in the carp a while ago that we didn't notice it.

173
00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:31.925
They probably sank all the stone garden lanterns they had in the yard

174
00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:34.625
into the swamp.

175
00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:36.125
To make it look as if

176
00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:38.725
there were no stone garden lanterns here...

177
00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.625
to begin with.

178
00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:48.725
They didn't want anyone other than themselves

179
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:52.225
to decipher the code that they found

180
00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:54.925
and take away the treasure.

181
00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:59.225
Treasure...

182
00:12:01.225 --> 00:12:03.225
Are you serious?

183
00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:06.025
Yes, most likely.

184
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.725
No, that's not all.

185
00:12:16.725 --> 00:12:18.725
It seems that the stone garden lanterns

186
00:12:18.725 --> 00:12:21.025
were not only sunk into the swamp to hide the code.

187
00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:24.525
What do you mean?

188
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:39.125
It seems it was done to hide a crime, too!

189
00:13:26.337 --> 00:13:30.337
The temperature of this swamp is approximately 20 degrees centigrade.

190
00:13:30.337 --> 00:13:35.537
Despite this, decay gas is not accumulated in the body yet.

191
00:13:35.537 --> 00:13:39.237
Which means it hasn't been too long since the victim's been killed.

192
00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:45.637
From the traces of strangulation left on the neck,

193
00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:48.837
he was probably choked to death then sunk into the swamp.

194
00:13:48.837 --> 00:13:50.337
The stone garden lanterns were probably stacked up one on top the other

195
00:13:50.337 --> 00:13:53.337
so that his body wouldn't come floating up.

196
00:13:54.537 --> 00:13:56.737
Who could've done this?

197
00:13:56.737 --> 00:13:58.137
Beats me.

198
00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:02.037
I'm sure it has something to do with treasure though.

199
00:14:02.037 --> 00:14:05.637
Mr. Teruhisa Tamai, age 42.

200
00:14:07.037 --> 00:14:10.137
How about it? Anything?

201
00:14:10.137 --> 00:14:11.237
No.

202
00:14:11.237 --> 00:14:14.837
It's just a driver's license, nothing else.

203
00:14:17.337 --> 00:14:19.037
There's something's inside.

204
00:14:19.037 --> 00:14:20.737
Hey. Is that the treasure?

205
00:14:22.937 --> 00:14:24.137
No.

206
00:14:24.137 --> 00:14:26.737
This is...

207
00:14:26.737 --> 00:14:29.537
a comma-shaped bead made of stone.

208
00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:31.537
The word fire is carved on it.

209
00:14:33.237 --> 00:14:36.237
Don't tell me that that's the treasure?

210
00:14:36.237 --> 00:14:39.637
What's this? It's just a strangely shaped stone.

211
00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:40.837
Hey!

212
00:14:40.837 --> 00:14:42.837
A person is dead here.

213
00:14:42.837 --> 00:14:45.737
How can you go on and on talking about treasure?

214
00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:49.437
Doc, will you call the police?

215
00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:51.537
Oh, that's right.

216
00:15:02.537 --> 00:15:05.137
I guess I can't call from here.

217
00:15:06.837 --> 00:15:08.837
The cell phone won't connect from here

218
00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:12.137
so I'll go back to the tent and call from there.

219
00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:13.437
Thanks!

220
00:15:13.437 --> 00:15:15.437
Be careful.

221
00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:18.137
So since the sun is starting to set,

222
00:15:18.137 --> 00:15:19.937
let's all head back to the tent, too.

223
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.237
Hey, Conan. You mean we're leaving just like that?

224
00:15:24.237 --> 00:15:28.837
Exactly! The treasure is right before our eyes, you know?

225
00:15:28.837 --> 00:15:31.137
-That's right! -Yes!

226
00:15:31.137 --> 00:15:32.137
Idiot!

227
00:15:32.137 --> 00:15:34.237
The one who killed this man

228
00:15:34.237 --> 00:15:37.037
could still be hiding somewhere around here yet.

229
00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:40.137
You guys! Do you want to be attacked wandering around here or what?

230
00:15:40.137 --> 00:15:41.537
But...

231
00:15:44.837 --> 00:15:46.137
Listen.

232
00:15:46.137 --> 00:15:49.037
And besides, we only found out what this man's name is,

233
00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:51.637
we don't know anything else, you know?

234
00:15:51.637 --> 00:15:53.537
He seems to be a treasure hunter.

235
00:15:55.137 --> 00:16:00.137
His notebook is filled with information and maps of treasures

236
00:16:00.137 --> 00:16:01.437
that are scattered all over Japan.

237
00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:05.937
-Really? -Yes.

238
00:16:05.937 --> 00:16:10.737
The process of his treasure hunt this time is written in detail, too.

239
00:16:12.537 --> 00:16:16.137
"I've been able to team up with a partner that's pretty good.

240
00:16:16.137 --> 00:16:21.337
So now I can outfox that petty thief that puts on airs."

241
00:16:21.337 --> 00:16:22.937
Petty thief that puts on airs?

242
00:16:30.137 --> 00:16:35.137
"I've been burned by that magician, time and again."

243
00:16:47.537 --> 00:16:51.037
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

244
00:16:51.037 --> 00:16:55.337
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

245
00:16:55.337 --> 00:16:58.137
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

246
00:16:58.137 --> 00:17:01.637
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

247
00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:05.837
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

248
00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:09.137
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

249
00:17:09.137 --> 00:17:11.637
Kichiemon Samizu.

250
00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:13.737
Samizu?

251
00:17:13.737 --> 00:17:16.037
Kichiemon Samizu.

252
00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:19.737
is the one who lived during the closing years of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

253
00:17:19.737 --> 00:17:23.137
He's the puppet maker who financially supported

254
00:17:23.137 --> 00:17:25.137
the samurai who backed up the Shogun.

255
00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:27.937
What a fantastic puppet!

256
00:17:27.937 --> 00:17:34.737
This puppet brings you tea, right?

257
00:17:34.737 --> 00:17:36.637
That's not all.

258
00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:39.837
When you finish drinking tea,

259
00:17:39.837 --> 00:17:43.237
it takes the tea cup back to where it came from, too.

260
00:17:43.237 --> 00:17:46.037
I bet a remote controller or something is used!

261
00:17:46.037 --> 00:17:48.937
No, it doesn't need that.

262
00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.837
It moves on its own.

263
00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:54.837
Then how does it run, Ayumi?

264
00:17:55.937 --> 00:17:58.137
I really don't know, but...

265
00:17:58.137 --> 00:18:01.737
They say the inside consist only of springs and gears.

266
00:18:01.737 --> 00:18:04.637
There are various other dolls,

267
00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:08.037
and there seem to be dolls that remain even now, made by word-of-mouth.

268
00:18:09.237 --> 00:18:11.237
You sure are smart.

269
00:18:11.237 --> 00:18:15.137
I saw a program about it on TV just the other day.

270
00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:18.737
At any rate, the dolls made by Kichiemon

271
00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:22.937
were reputed and favoured among the merchants as looking to be alive.

272
00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:24.637
Therefore, he made a fortune in a single generation.

273
00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:27.537
People called him "Puppet Maker Kichiemon".

274
00:18:27.537 --> 00:18:32.137
Does that mean the doll of the God of Strength made by Kichiemon

275
00:18:32.137 --> 00:18:35.237
is somewhere in this house?

276
00:18:37.037 --> 00:18:38.937
Doll of the God of Strength?

277
00:18:44.537 --> 00:18:49.637
No. Even if it were to be here, 140 years have passed.

278
00:18:49.637 --> 00:18:52.537
Hidden in a dilapidated place like this,

279
00:18:52.537 --> 00:18:54.837
I'm sure it would be all had it by now.

280
00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:58.237
Oh, so it's all beat up.

281
00:18:59.437 --> 00:19:02.737
The treasure is the stone of the God.

282
00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:09.137
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

283
00:19:09.137 --> 00:19:14.137
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

284
00:19:14.137 --> 00:19:16.837
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

285
00:19:16.837 --> 00:19:18.937
And that's what's written.

286
00:19:18.937 --> 00:19:21.437
So what does that mean?

287
00:19:21.437 --> 00:19:25.937
Right. What is the meaning of the letters that are carved on that stone?

288
00:19:26.937 --> 00:19:29.637
It's too difficult and hard to understand.

289
00:19:29.637 --> 00:19:31.637
To make it simple,

290
00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.637
it says that the stone of the God Nioh can be found

291
00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:38.937
in a place nearest to the sun where the God Nioh sleep.

292
00:19:38.937 --> 00:19:41.737
That is a very busy place where the elders get together.

293
00:19:41.737 --> 00:19:44.237
What is that stone of the God Nioh?

294
00:19:44.237 --> 00:19:48.237
It's not just any other stone, is it?

295
00:19:48.237 --> 00:19:54.337
The God of Strength owns a very hard stone.

296
00:19:54.337 --> 00:19:57.337
A very hard stone...

297
00:19:57.337 --> 00:20:00.137
In other words,

298
00:20:00.137 --> 00:20:02.137
the King of Stones.

299
00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:03.537
A diamond.

300
00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.737
Diamond...

301
00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:12.637
Yes, diamonds are said to have been brought into Japan

302
00:20:12.637 --> 00:20:15.537
at the period towards the end of the Shogunate government,

303
00:20:15.537 --> 00:20:17.437
so the time is just about right.

304
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.337
Come to think of it, during that TV program,

305
00:20:23.337 --> 00:20:27.937
it said that they found an odd map in Kichiemon's storeroom.

306
00:20:27.937 --> 00:20:31.837
The man probably saw the map on a recent TV program,

307
00:20:31.837 --> 00:20:33.837
searched for this mansion,

308
00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:36.737
and found the stone lanterns here.

309
00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:40.537
And the partner that he believed in

310
00:20:40.537 --> 00:20:42.537
and thought would be useful ended up killing him.

311
00:20:42.537 --> 00:20:45.737
That's most likely what happened.

312
00:20:45.737 --> 00:20:47.037
Wait.

313
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:50.537
There's something more written here.

314
00:20:52.937 --> 00:20:54.837
What comes after that is the problem.

315
00:20:54.837 --> 00:21:02.837
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh.

316
00:21:02.837 --> 00:21:05.237
It's there after all.

317
00:21:05.237 --> 00:21:09.537
And get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand.

318
00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:14.837
Their hands brimming with stones?

319
00:21:17.137 --> 00:21:18.537
Hey, Conan.

320
00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:21.337
What is it? Tell us what follows.

321
00:21:21.337 --> 00:21:26.337
Their hands brimming with...

322
00:21:26.337 --> 00:21:27.937
The Big Jewel!

323
00:21:32.237 --> 00:21:34.537
No doubt about it.

324
00:21:34.537 --> 00:21:35.937
Hey, hey.

325
00:21:35.937 --> 00:21:39.537
Let's leave Conan behind and go look for the treasure ourselves.

326
00:21:41.537 --> 00:21:43.537
I guess so.

327
00:21:43.537 --> 00:21:45.937
Let's go look for the treasure ourselves.

328
00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:51.637
What? But without Conan we can't decipher the code.

329
00:21:51.637 --> 00:21:53.937
Don't worry.

330
00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:57.437
I think the key to the ignition has already been turned.

331
00:22:04.237 --> 00:22:05.837
This is interesting.

332
00:22:05.837 --> 00:22:07.637
A mansion of tricks.

333
00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:09.337
Great.

334
00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:03.037
"Next Episode"

335
00:24:03.037 --> 00:24:04.737
Skulls!

336
00:24:12.937 --> 00:24:15.237
No! That's a trap!

337
00:24:19.037 --> 00:24:20.037
Hey!

338
00:24:22.337 --> 00:24:28.337
Next Conan, "Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Tricks"

339
00:24:29.164 --> 00:24:31.264
Next Conan's Hint:

340
00:24:31.264 --> 00:24:33.564
"Three types of sacred treasures"

341
00:24:33.564 --> 00:24:35.564
Next week, he'll be appearing after a long time!

342
00:24:35.564 --> 00:24:36.664
-Who's he? -Who's that?

343
00:24:36.664 --> 00:24:37.964
His rival.
