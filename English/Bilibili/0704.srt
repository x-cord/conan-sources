1
00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:04.524
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event

2
00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:06.124
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:08.224
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:13.124
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:16.624
The deduction quiz that is held on the train,

6
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:20.524
in the wink of an eye turns into a locked room murder.

7
00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:25.824
In the meantime, a black shadow closes in on Haibara.

8
00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:30.324
Moreover, who is the man with the burn that kidnapped Sera?

9
00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:37.324
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:37.324 --> 00:00:39.524
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:41.524
The train is in panic because of their trap.

12
00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.024
Haibara's fate hangs in the balance!

13
00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:45.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:47.624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult!

15
00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:50.324
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:38.628
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Last Stop)"

17
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:42.228
But, Detective...

18
00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.628
Don't you think that your deduction's a bit too far out?

19
00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:50.028
It's not easy to increase a loop in the chain lock

20
00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:52.828
and if the bulb of the lamp of my room wasn't burnt out,

21
00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:55.428
I wouldn't be able to call the conductor to my room, would I?

22
00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:57.628
The only reason why I called the conductor

23
00:02:57.628 --> 00:02:59.528
was because the alarm of the wristwatch

24
00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:01.828
that was forgotten in my room coincidentally went off.

25
00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:05.528
Conductor, you mentioned earlier

26
00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:09.228
that one of your uniforms were missing, didn't you?

27
00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:10.428
Yes.

28
00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:14.828
Mr. Ando is probably the one who stole it.

29
00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.328
If he wore the uniform and got himself mixed up

30
00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.728
in the examination of the train before boarding,

31
00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:21.228
it would have been possible for him

32
00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:23.228
to change the chain lock at the scene of the crime,

33
00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:25.828
or change the burnt out lamp of Mr. Noto's room

34
00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:29.428
or hide the wristwatch in Ms. Idenami's room.

35
00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:31.828
Moreover, if Mr. Ando used a remote controller

36
00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:33.528
to ring the alarm of the wristwatch again

37
00:03:33.528 --> 00:03:35.528
while Ms. Idenami and the conductor

38
00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:37.428
were arguing to distract them,

39
00:03:37.428 --> 00:03:39.928
even if Mr. Ando who was hiding in room B

40
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.028
were to use the fishing line to open the door of room C

41
00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:43.828
that he had covered the door with the mirrors with,

42
00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:45.828
no one would've noticed.

43
00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:48.128
After he chain locked room B,

44
00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:50.628
hiding behind the door where he had placed the mirrors on,

45
00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:52.728
if he closes the door and pretends to have

46
00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:54.728
come out of his own room

47
00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:57.528
and walk towards Ms. Idenami.

48
00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:58.528
Despite the conductor

49
00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:01.128
having been in the corridor right through,

50
00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:02.828
a situation is created where no one

51
00:04:02.828 --> 00:04:07.228
was seen going in or out of the crime scene.

52
00:04:07.228 --> 00:04:08.628
Well, but unfortunately,

53
00:04:08.628 --> 00:04:11.028
just before he was about to open the mirrored door,

54
00:04:11.028 --> 00:04:13.528
Ms. Komino and her maid came along the corridor.

55
00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:16.628
There was a chance that they would've notice the fishing line,

56
00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:18.628
but in the darkness of the tunnel,

57
00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:20.428
it probably slipped their notice.

58
00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:22.828
Don't tell me that you deliberately didn't mention this

59
00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:26.328
because you didn't want to become involved?

60
00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:29.728
But, why would Mr. Ando kill Mr. Murobashi?

61
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.028
Weren't you supposed to be friends

62
00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:33.728
that were rescued from the fire that occurred five years ago?

63
00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:38.128
Yes. I thought so until two years ago,

64
00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:39.728
until I saw that picture

65
00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:43.628
that was supposed to have burned in the fire at an auction.

66
00:04:43.628 --> 00:04:44.928
What?

67
00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:48.528
I searched for the owner of the picture

68
00:04:48.528 --> 00:04:52.428
and ended up seeing Murobashi's name.

69
00:04:52.428 --> 00:04:54.128
I see.

70
00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:56.728
Mr. Murobashi stole the picture from the house,

71
00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:58.228
and in order to hide what he did,

72
00:04:58.228 --> 00:05:00.528
he set fire to the house?

73
00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:03.228
As a result many people fell victim.

74
00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:06.128
Yes. If that guy,

75
00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:07.828
like us, was boarding this train every year

76
00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:10.528
to pray that the souls of the people

77
00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:14.128
who died in the fire would rest at peace,

78
00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:16.828
I would've urged him to turn himself in.

79
00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:19.228
But while we were waiting to play

80
00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:23.028
the fake roles of the deduction quiz,

81
00:05:23.028 --> 00:05:24.428
he, the victim, me the culprit,

82
00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:26.828
and the children the detective,

83
00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.528
that guy said this.

84
00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:32.528
This kind of thing is exciting after all!

85
00:05:32.528 --> 00:05:35.328
I mean I really feel alive.

86
00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:38.528
Don't you recall the fire that we barely

87
00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:40.528
made out alive from?

88
00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:45.628
That guy said so in sheer delight,

89
00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.428
reddening his cheeks!

90
00:05:48.428 --> 00:05:50.728
My wife was caught up in smoke

91
00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:54.128
and died in that fire too, and yet...

92
00:05:57.228 --> 00:05:58.728
Yukiko.

93
00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:01.628
You seem to want to cast a smokescreen over us.

94
00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.228
You people got no chance.

95
00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:04.528
Oh, yes, we have!

96
00:06:04.528 --> 00:06:08.028
Because Shinichi's got a hold of your weak point, Sharon.

97
00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:09.228
Don't tell me that

98
00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:12.328
you think my hands are tied because we're friends?

99
00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:15.728
I don't think your friends know, Sharon?

100
00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:17.528
That Shinichi and that girl have become children

101
00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:20.728
because of the drug?

102
00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:23.228
If you narrow down the search to elementary school children,

103
00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:26.928
it'll be a matter of time before you find them.

104
00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.328
Shinichi said that

105
00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:32.628
you may have a reason for hiding the fact

106
00:06:32.628 --> 00:06:36.028
that you know about this.

107
00:06:37.228 --> 00:06:38.628
And what about...

108
00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:41.828
Suguru Itakura?

109
00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:43.628
You know him, don't you?

110
00:06:43.628 --> 00:06:45.128
The computer graphics creator

111
00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:47.828
who was working on special visual effect that we,

112
00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:50.728
the actresses were all acquainted with.

113
00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:52.928
I was surprised to hear from Shinichi

114
00:06:52.928 --> 00:06:56.728
that you ordered some kind of system from him.

115
00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:59.428
My fellow performers were saying that

116
00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:01.628
both of you were clashed during a certain movie

117
00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:03.328
and are on bad terms.

118
00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:04.828
I'm sure that you changed your voice

119
00:07:04.828 --> 00:07:06.428
when you called him to make your request,

120
00:07:06.428 --> 00:07:09.128
as would be expected of you.

121
00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:12.328
The system that you went out of your way to order from him.

122
00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:13.828
Does it have something to do with

123
00:07:13.828 --> 00:07:16.328
the fact that the two have changed into children?

124
00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:18.928
Yukiko, that's enough.

125
00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:22.528
Stay out of this!

126
00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:25.928
Your stupid plan is all figured out already.

127
00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:28.628
Plan? Just what are you talking about?

128
00:07:29.128 --> 00:07:32.628
If she realizes that we're on board this train,

129
00:07:32.628 --> 00:07:35.928
there's only one thing she would do.

130
00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:37.828
She'd drink the antidote of that drug

131
00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:40.228
and return to her previous self.

132
00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:43.528
If she is killed as a child

133
00:07:43.528 --> 00:07:46.328
and her body is found in the train,

134
00:07:46.328 --> 00:07:49.728
those children will cry and make a big fuss.

135
00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:52.928
On the other hand, if she returns to her true self,

136
00:07:52.928 --> 00:07:55.328
even if her body were to be found,

137
00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:57.228
for the children, the dead body

138
00:07:57.228 --> 00:08:00.028
would be that of a woman they just met once.

139
00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:02.428
The children would be more worried about Ai's disappearance

140
00:08:02.428 --> 00:08:04.228
that they would not dwell on the incident.

141
00:08:04.228 --> 00:08:07.828
That would also distract the Organization from the matter.

142
00:08:07.828 --> 00:08:09.628
Well, I don't think that

143
00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:12.728
your son or Dr. Agasa would think that way though.

144
00:08:12.728 --> 00:08:14.928
They would never be able to say that

145
00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:20.128
the woman's body is Ai's previous body.

146
00:08:20.128 --> 00:08:22.328
Right. I'm sure that

147
00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:25.028
you would assume that she would act that way,

148
00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:26.028
and so you would try to get a hold of her

149
00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:27.628
before she drinks the drug.

150
00:08:27.628 --> 00:08:28.828
Then, you'd disguise yourself

151
00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:30.428
as what she previously looked to be,

152
00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:32.728
pretend that you were killed by us

153
00:08:32.728 --> 00:08:35.128
and deceive the eyes of the Organization this way.

154
00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:36.728
Is that what you were planning to do?

155
00:08:36.728 --> 00:08:40.628
If she's not hidden here in your room,

156
00:08:40.628 --> 00:08:41.828
it seems that

157
00:08:41.828 --> 00:08:44.428
you haven't been able to get a hold of her yet.

158
00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:46.428
Just what are you talking about?

159
00:08:46.428 --> 00:08:49.328
The trunk you threw out of the window a while ago.

160
00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:51.128
You looked inside, didn't you?

161
00:08:51.128 --> 00:08:53.828
Did you see any outfits for disguise in there?

162
00:08:53.828 --> 00:08:55.028
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:55.528 --> 00:08:58.528
I got rid of the contents before I threw the trunk out.

164
00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:03.028
I also threw out the disguise outfits that were hidden

165
00:09:03.028 --> 00:09:04.728
under this water basin too.

166
00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:08.228
Even the bullet proof jacket with the blood trick on it!

167
00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:11.128
But, if you haven't found her yet either,

168
00:09:11.128 --> 00:09:12.828
aren't we still even?

169
00:09:12.828 --> 00:09:16.128
No problem. Don't worry.

170
00:09:16.128 --> 00:09:20.228
We're prepared to smoke her out already.

171
00:09:30.928 --> 00:09:33.928
Mr. Ando, please finish up at the police.

172
00:09:33.928 --> 00:09:37.628
Hey, what is it? That smoke?

173
00:09:37.628 --> 00:09:38.628
Hey, don't tell me...

174
00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:40.328
I'll go check.

175
00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:44.528
Fire?

176
00:09:44.528 --> 00:09:46.128
It's a fire!

177
00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:50.028
Everybody, hurry and evacuate to the car in front!

178
00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:53.828
Pops! Wake up!

179
00:09:53.828 --> 00:09:55.228
Hurry up, grannies!

180
00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:56.428
Yes.

181
00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:57.728
Emergency!

182
00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:01.328
A fire has broken out in car number 8 of this train!

183
00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:03.428
Passengers in car number 7 and 6,

184
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:06.628
please evacuate to the car in front just in case!

185
00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:08.628
This is car number 6, isn't it?

186
00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:09.728
Yep.

187
00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:11.428
We've got to get out of here then.

188
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:13.128
Please calm down everyone!

189
00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:15.528
There's no need to hurry.

190
00:10:24.628 --> 00:10:26.028
Just as I thought,

191
00:10:26.028 --> 00:10:27.328
the passengers of car number 8

192
00:10:27.328 --> 00:10:29.528
are all fire phobic.

193
00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:32.528
Thanks to them, there's great panic.

194
00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:34.028
Sure looks it.

195
00:10:34.028 --> 00:10:35.928
Here's a question for you!

196
00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:39.428
Where do you think she'd go in this situation?

197
00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:43.328
Well, I'm sure she'll flee to the car in front.

198
00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:45.628
No, just the opposite.

199
00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:48.028
She'd probably...

200
00:11:10.728 --> 00:11:14.328
Just as would be expected of Hell Angel's daughter.

201
00:11:14.328 --> 00:11:16.328
You look alike.

202
00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:21.828
How do you do?

203
00:11:24.228 --> 00:11:28.628
Bourbon. This is my code name.

204
00:11:43.478 --> 00:11:44.678
Oh, Mr. Mouri!

205
00:11:44.678 --> 00:11:47.178
Dad! Where're Conan and Sera?

206
00:11:47.178 --> 00:11:48.278
Huh?

207
00:11:48.278 --> 00:11:50.878
I was with that glasses boy till a while ago but...

208
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:51.878
If you're talking about that tomboy,

209
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.578
she left to go over to your place quite some time ago!

210
00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:57.178
-Huh? -She didn't come!

211
00:11:57.178 --> 00:11:58.378
If so, maybe she went to the wrong car

212
00:11:58.378 --> 00:12:01.078
-and is walking around. -Pops.

213
00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:02.178
Where's Ai?

214
00:12:02.178 --> 00:12:03.878
She went that way, right?

215
00:12:03.878 --> 00:12:06.078
Isn't she with Conan?

216
00:12:06.078 --> 00:12:08.178
Wasn't she with you guys?

217
00:12:08.178 --> 00:12:11.278
Well, she never came back after going to the bathroom!

218
00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:14.478
Then, maybe she fled to a car more in front?

219
00:12:14.478 --> 00:12:15.978
I thought so too and looked for her

220
00:12:15.978 --> 00:12:17.578
but couldn't find her.

221
00:12:17.578 --> 00:12:21.078
I tell you, what a brat.

222
00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:23.678
Right.

223
00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:25.878
I'm sure that she would go over to car number 8

224
00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:27.278
where the fire started

225
00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:29.578
because she'd think that this fire commotion

226
00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:32.078
is a trap that we set up to smoke her out.

227
00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:34.578
I see! If she flees to the front car,

228
00:12:34.578 --> 00:12:36.378
you'd be waiting for her there

229
00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:38.578
so she decided to do otherwise, eh?

230
00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:40.778
You don't understand, do you?

231
00:12:40.778 --> 00:12:45.178
Her friends will all evacuate to the front car, you know?

232
00:12:45.178 --> 00:12:48.378
If she, who's being sought after, goes there,

233
00:12:48.378 --> 00:12:50.778
she may get them all involved.

234
00:12:50.778 --> 00:12:52.378
That's why she would deliberately

235
00:12:52.378 --> 00:12:54.578
go to the place where the fire started.

236
00:12:54.578 --> 00:12:59.178
Even if we were to be waiting there...

237
00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:00.878
She'd figure that it would be better for her

238
00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:02.778
to be killed alone.

239
00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:08.778
The phone.

240
00:13:11.578 --> 00:13:13.778
Shinichi.

241
00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:18.178
Shinichi, what's up?

242
00:13:18.178 --> 00:13:19.878
Mom, we're in trouble!

243
00:13:19.878 --> 00:13:23.778
Haibara's nowhere in sight.

244
00:13:23.778 --> 00:13:25.878
Isn't she with you, Mom?

245
00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:28.278
She's not here either!

246
00:13:28.278 --> 00:13:30.878
Maybe she evacuated to the front car?

247
00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:32.378
It's easier for her to hide herself

248
00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:34.278
by mingling in the crowd besides.

249
00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:36.778
Okay, I'll check the front.

250
00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:38.978
Mom, you stick to the plan!

251
00:13:38.978 --> 00:13:40.378
Okay!

252
00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:45.578
So, your son will be going to the front car.

253
00:13:48.378 --> 00:13:51.878
And this is mail from my comrade.

254
00:13:51.878 --> 00:13:53.578
Oh, how disappointing.

255
00:13:53.578 --> 00:13:56.778
They seem to have found her in car number 8.

256
00:13:58.478 --> 00:14:01.378
It looks like our win.

257
00:14:02.578 --> 00:14:03.878
Bourbon.

258
00:14:03.878 --> 00:14:07.778
This code name, doesn't it sound familiar?

259
00:14:07.778 --> 00:14:10.978
I've met your family once.

260
00:14:10.978 --> 00:14:13.778
Yes. I know.

261
00:14:13.778 --> 00:14:16.178
You're a member of the Organization

262
00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:19.478
that was a rival of Dai Moroboshi, my big sister's boyfriend.

263
00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:20.978
According to what she said,

264
00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:23.578
you both seemed to hate each other.

265
00:14:23.578 --> 00:14:29.178
Just as I thought, that guy was a dog of the FBI.

266
00:14:29.178 --> 00:14:30.678
After betraying the Organization,

267
00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:34.378
I found it hard to believe that he was gotten rid of.

268
00:14:34.378 --> 00:14:37.378
I disguised myself as him and stuck around

269
00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:41.078
to watch the reactions of the people involved.

270
00:14:41.078 --> 00:14:46.578
Thanks to that, I found out that the guy was really dead.

271
00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:49.278
Well, the one who helped me disguise myself

272
00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:53.378
was the man who disguised himself in my place, though.

273
00:14:53.378 --> 00:14:56.478
The fact that you're here,

274
00:14:56.478 --> 00:15:00.678
goes to show that it was effective in causing you fear.

275
00:15:03.678 --> 00:15:07.378
Then, please raise your hands, and let's move on

276
00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:09.278
to the cargo car that is behind

277
00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:10.978
car number 8.

278
00:15:15.878 --> 00:15:19.778
It's only an hour before the Bell Tree Express arrives!

279
00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:23.078
All of you! Be on your guard, understand?

280
00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:24.878
How stupid can they get.

281
00:15:24.878 --> 00:15:26.878
Not knowing that as soon as the train arrives,

282
00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:28.578
they'll all blow up due to the bomb

283
00:15:28.578 --> 00:15:31.378
that is set up on the platform.

284
00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:34.278
More than that, Vermouth and Bourbon,

285
00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:36.878
how are they going to escape from the train?

286
00:15:36.878 --> 00:15:37.978
They know about it, don't they,

287
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:39.278
about the explosion?

288
00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:43.078
I wonder. That's none of my business.

289
00:15:43.078 --> 00:15:46.778
But, Vermouth asked me to give her a bomb

290
00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:48.078
if I had any extra.

291
00:15:48.078 --> 00:15:49.378
What?

292
00:15:49.378 --> 00:15:51.578
I asked her what she was going to use it for,

293
00:15:51.578 --> 00:15:53.878
but she didn't tell me.

294
00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:58.478
That woman. Don't tell me she's...

295
00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:02.478
Go on. Open that door and go inside.

296
00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:07.478
Don't worry.

297
00:16:07.478 --> 00:16:11.478
I plan to take you back to the Organization alive.

298
00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:12.478
I'm going to use this bomb

299
00:16:12.478 --> 00:16:14.678
to damage the connecting part

300
00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:16.878
and cut off only the cargo.

301
00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:18.078
As soon as it stops,

302
00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:21.978
my comrades are supposed to come and get you.

303
00:16:21.978 --> 00:16:27.178
In the meantime, I'll need you to pass out for a while.

304
00:16:28.478 --> 00:16:30.378
Well, everything will be fine.

305
00:16:30.378 --> 00:16:33.078
I'll lay you down far from the door,

306
00:16:33.078 --> 00:16:35.178
so you don't need to worry about being blown up.

307
00:16:35.178 --> 00:16:37.878
I don't think so.

308
00:16:37.878 --> 00:16:41.978
It seems that this cargo car is full of bombs.

309
00:16:42.578 --> 00:16:46.878
There seems to have been some mistake in your plans, huh?

310
00:16:46.878 --> 00:16:48.378
I see.

311
00:16:48.378 --> 00:16:53.378
Vermouth is intent on killing her at all costs.

312
00:16:53.378 --> 00:16:57.178
I've got no choice. I'll have you come with me.

313
00:16:57.178 --> 00:16:59.378
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

314
00:17:01.078 --> 00:17:03.578
You're a bunch of trouble just as rumor has it.

315
00:17:03.578 --> 00:17:06.978
I guess I'll have to get a bit rough with you.

316
00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:11.478
Vermouth?

317
00:17:11.478 --> 00:17:13.478
Sorry, but I'm taking her with me.

318
00:17:17.478 --> 00:17:18.778
A hand grenade!

319
00:17:18.778 --> 00:17:21.678
Who is it? Who are you?

320
00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:28.878
Darn!

321
00:17:40.778 --> 00:17:41.978
"Activation Device Launched, Comfirmed"

322
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.678
So, that's the end.

323
00:17:44.678 --> 00:17:46.978
No joke, this isn't happening, is it?

324
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:49.978
Rest assured. Our members caused the explosion

325
00:17:49.978 --> 00:17:53.378
after they confirmed that the connecting part was damaged.

326
00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:56.078
This car will not go off track.

327
00:17:56.078 --> 00:17:57.078
Ai.

328
00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:03.878
Ai!

329
00:18:08.178 --> 00:18:10.378
You got rid of Sherry?

330
00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:12.878
Are you sure, Vermouth?

331
00:18:12.878 --> 00:18:15.578
Yes. It seems that

332
00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:17.978
Bourbon watched the cargo car blow up.

333
00:18:17.978 --> 00:18:21.078
Thanks to that, the train is stopped at a nearby station.

334
00:18:21.078 --> 00:18:22.478
It seems that all the passengers

335
00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:24.478
will be interrogated, though.

336
00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:25.778
How disappointing that

337
00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:29.278
I won't get to see you in Nagoya where you're waiting.

338
00:18:29.278 --> 00:18:31.378
That's why you wanted the bomb.

339
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.578
If an explosion occurs on board,

340
00:18:33.578 --> 00:18:35.778
there's no choice but to stop the train.

341
00:18:35.778 --> 00:18:37.378
Yes.

342
00:18:37.378 --> 00:18:41.478
It's enough that only Sherry is blown to pieces, isn't it?

343
00:18:41.478 --> 00:18:43.778
But, I was really surprised!

344
00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:46.878
To find that Haibara was in room B of car 7.

345
00:18:46.878 --> 00:18:48.578
It seems to have been opened

346
00:18:48.578 --> 00:18:50.578
because it was the room where the man died.

347
00:18:50.578 --> 00:18:51.578
It seems she felt faint

348
00:18:51.578 --> 00:18:54.978
after going to the restroom and rested there!

349
00:18:54.978 --> 00:18:58.878
Quiet. Because she seems to be tired and asleep.

350
00:18:58.878 --> 00:19:00.478
Okay.

351
00:19:00.478 --> 00:19:02.578
I see.

352
00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:03.678
Thinking that if she were to flee anywhere,

353
00:19:03.678 --> 00:19:07.878
it would be the only place, so Yukiko protected her.

354
00:19:07.878 --> 00:19:10.978
Then, that call that her son made back then was...

355
00:19:10.978 --> 00:19:15.478
A fake call to keep me in that room.

356
00:19:15.478 --> 00:19:16.678
But, wait.

357
00:19:16.678 --> 00:19:18.378
If so, who is it?

358
00:19:18.378 --> 00:19:21.978
The girl that exploded to death in front of Bourbon's eyes?

359
00:19:21.978 --> 00:19:22.978
Don't tell me

360
00:19:22.978 --> 00:19:25.678
they really have somebody else cooperating with them.

361
00:20:51.678 --> 00:20:53.078
But, wait.

362
00:20:53.078 --> 00:20:54.678
If so, who is it?

363
00:20:54.678 --> 00:20:58.278
The girl that exploded to death in front of Bourbon's eyes?

364
00:20:58.278 --> 00:20:59.278
Don't tell me

365
00:20:59.278 --> 00:21:02.778
they really have somebody else cooperating with them.

366
00:21:02.778 --> 00:21:06.978
I'm disappointed. So, Thief Kid can't come here anymore.

367
00:21:06.978 --> 00:21:08.478
This train won't be usable for a while

368
00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:10.678
until their done investigating it so...

369
00:21:10.678 --> 00:21:12.878
-Don't tell me that... -Sorry.

370
00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:16.078
It seems like things were looking really bad, huh.

371
00:21:16.078 --> 00:21:18.778
Don't tell me that the one helping them out is...

372
00:21:20.878 --> 00:21:22.378
Nobody told me about this!

373
00:21:22.378 --> 00:21:24.878
What's this all about? Who were those dangerous guys?

374
00:21:24.878 --> 00:21:27.578
If I didn't have my hand glider hidden in the cargo car,

375
00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:29.478
I would've been burnt black by now!

376
00:21:29.478 --> 00:21:32.778
Knowing you, I figured you'd have that ready.

377
00:21:32.778 --> 00:21:35.478
Well, I guess we both owe each other nothing anymore.

378
00:21:35.478 --> 00:21:37.078
Of course not!

379
00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:38.878
Oh, that cell phone.

380
00:21:38.878 --> 00:21:41.478
Send it back to the Detective Agency, will you?

381
00:21:42.878 --> 00:21:44.878
Oh, hey?

382
00:21:44.878 --> 00:21:47.178
That rotten brat.

383
00:21:47.178 --> 00:21:51.178
You grannies are Thief Kid and his henchmen, right?

384
00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:53.678
What kind of joke is that supposed to be?

385
00:21:53.678 --> 00:21:55.778
The maid Ms. Sumitomo is Thief Kid,

386
00:21:55.778 --> 00:21:57.178
and you granny, is his henchman!

387
00:21:57.178 --> 00:22:01.078
It seems that the henchman cannot speak in Ms. Komino's voice.

388
00:22:01.078 --> 00:22:05.178
You moved your lips along as Kid acted as the ventriloquist

389
00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:09.078
and you tried to block the vision using the veil of your hat.

390
00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:13.378
I see. That's why you made me run along the corridor, eh?

391
00:22:13.378 --> 00:22:14.778
Yeah!

392
00:22:14.778 --> 00:22:16.678
I thought that if granny was left back alone,

393
00:22:16.678 --> 00:22:19.078
she wouldn't be able to talk!

394
00:22:19.078 --> 00:22:20.878
Besides, all the people

395
00:22:20.878 --> 00:22:22.178
who were rescued from the fire in question,

396
00:22:22.178 --> 00:22:23.978
were afraid of the flames,

397
00:22:23.978 --> 00:22:28.278
but you didn't seem concerned and lighted your pipe.

398
00:22:28.278 --> 00:22:30.478
Well, show me gratitude!

399
00:22:30.478 --> 00:22:32.278
Because I'm letting all of you guys

400
00:22:32.278 --> 00:22:34.078
who don't want to get involved

401
00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:35.578
and insist on having seen nothing go.

402
00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:39.778
And? What do you want me to do for you?

403
00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:41.578
I want you to disguise as her

404
00:22:41.578 --> 00:22:45.578
and dodge their attack.

405
00:22:45.578 --> 00:22:47.478
As to the contents that you'll be talking with them about,

406
00:22:47.478 --> 00:22:51.278
she'll be using an earphone to tell you what to say.

407
00:22:51.278 --> 00:22:53.778
What do you mean we're even?

408
00:22:53.778 --> 00:22:57.678
You owe me one, famed detective.

409
00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:02.578
I see.

410
00:23:02.578 --> 00:23:07.978
So it was top-notch casting, Yukiko.

411
00:23:10.878 --> 00:23:12.578
Sera!

412
00:23:12.578 --> 00:23:13.978
I'm glad.

413
00:23:13.978 --> 00:23:17.978
I picked a cap up in the corridor, it's yours, isn't it?

414
00:23:17.978 --> 00:23:20.478
Oh, yep. Thank you.

415
00:23:21.878 --> 00:23:24.478
Why was it in the corridor?

416
00:23:24.478 --> 00:23:26.378
Everybody's over that way, so let's go!

417
00:23:26.378 --> 00:23:28.278
Oh, okay.

418
00:23:30.978 --> 00:23:33.678
Will you show me the detailed file of

419
00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:35.478
just before Akai's death once again?

420
00:23:35.478 --> 00:23:36.878
Yes.

421
00:23:37.678 --> 00:23:39.278
It seems necessary

422
00:23:39.278 --> 00:23:42.778
to start investigating again from scratch.

423
00:23:51.378 --> 00:23:52.678
Don't open the door!

424
00:23:56.878 --> 00:24:01.278
Oh, so Mr. Mouri are here too!

425
00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:03.978
The corpse was lying on the ground blocking the door,

426
00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:06.778
and yet was is it a homicide?

427
00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:09.678
That's what Conan said, and he was inside.

428
00:24:09.678 --> 00:24:12.778
Moreover, this is an impossible crime.

429
00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:15.578
Another locked room murder?

430
00:24:15.578 --> 00:24:21.178
Next Conan, "Conan in a Locked Room"

431
00:24:36.678 --> 00:24:38.678
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:38.678 --> 00:24:41.078
"Special Coach"

433
00:24:41.078 --> 00:24:42.478
Sonoko, are you going through special intensive training?

434
00:24:42.478 --> 00:24:44.378
You've got to be strong in love and tennis too.

435
00:24:44.378 --> 00:24:45.878
Love's different.
