1
00:00:01.758 --> 00:00:05.158
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05.158 --> 00:00:06.458
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:09.058
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:11.958
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:15.258
We succeeded in getting Kir or Rena Mizunashi

6
00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:18.658
to serve as a source of information concerning the Organization,

7
00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:20.058
but this turns out to be way riskier than we could imagine.

8
00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:25.558
The president of a foreign talent production company

9
00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.558
is murdered at New Beika Hotel.

10
00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:32.158
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -Four suspects are his secretary Ms. Irina Palmer.

11
00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:34.858
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -English teacher, Mr. Hal Buckner.

12
00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:37.358
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Model, Mr. Toby Keynes.

13
00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:41.358
"Andre Camel, age 27" -And surprisingly, agent Camel of the FBI.

14
00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:44.358
The message President Sunouchi seems to have written

15
00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:45.658
just before passing away,

16
00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:48.358
that the killer seems to have taken with him,

17
00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:50.158
"Jodie Starling" -said this...

18
00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:52.158
Bring my tux.

19
00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:55.058
Bring my tuxedo please.

20
00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:57.858
Just what does this dying message mean?

21
00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:03.158
Just then, agent Akai of the FBI receives a call.

22
00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:07.758
-Yes. -It's me, Rena Mizunashi.

23
00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:10.558
Well, the thing is I don't feel comfortable here.

24
00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:14.058
I want to get out of here, so I want you to help me.

25
00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:16.158
"Gin"

26
00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:19.858
I'll send you the time and place later by email, then.

27
00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:21.258
Yeah.

28
00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:24.158
"James Black" -Was that Rena Mizunashi?

29
00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:25.358
Yes.

30
00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:29.058
She wants me to meet her now, just the two of us.

31
00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:30.458
If she's saying just the two of you,

32
00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:32.058
it could be a trap.

33
00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.258
I'd advise you not to go.

34
00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:35.558
Yes.

35
00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.858
If it is a trap though,

36
00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:39.058
if I don't go,

37
00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:41.058
there's a ten to one chance that they'll kill her.

38
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.158
She's being suspected by the Organization.

39
00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:48.058
But...

40
00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:49.458
I'll be fine.

41
00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:53.158
I pride myself for having pretty sharp hunches.

42
00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:56.158
She is an agent of the CIA,

43
00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:57.258
so I'm sure she's thought up something

44
00:01:57.258 --> 00:01:58.558
to make it through this too.

45
00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:01.758
At any rate, let's call Jodie

46
00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:03.658
and think of what we as FBI agents can do...

47
00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.658
What seems to be the matter?

48
00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.158
Sizzling hot suspense.

49
00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:31.758
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

50
00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:33.358
The members of the Youth Detective Squad burst into laughter.

51
00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:35.258
At the magic words that discloses the culprit.

52
00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:36.758
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:38.358
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.358
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

55
00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:18.439
"Red and Black Crash: Desperation"

56
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.239
That's what the report from Chiba said.

57
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:24.539
As a result of the investigation,

58
00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.239
it has been found that Irina

59
00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:28.539
who is not able to sufficiently read and write Japanese

60
00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.039
was corresponding with the president in English.

61
00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.539
It has been confirmed that Hal is working

62
00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.239
as an English teacher at a prep school nearby.

63
00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:40.839
Toby is working as a fashion model.

64
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:43.939
All this has been verified as true.

65
00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:49.139
As to Camel, we will believe agent Jodie's words,

66
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.139
claiming that he is a FBI agent.

67
00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.639
That will be all as far as we're concerned.

68
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.239
Oh, but please wait a little while more!

69
00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:01.539
Hey, did you solve the thing about the memo?

70
00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.439
That's still under investigation.

71
00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.439
Memo?

72
00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.639
She's talking about the dining message, right?

73
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.239
I think you meant to say dying message, Genta.

74
00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:13.039
That...

75
00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.139
If we're just going to have to wait here,

76
00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.739
I'd like to be given permission to leave for about two hours.

77
00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:20.639
The class that I'm in charge of is scheduled to start pretty soon.

78
00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.939
Me too.

79
00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.939
May I leave to go to the hotel reception?

80
00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.239
I've got to do a lot of canceling and stuff.

81
00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:31.139
Besides, maybe I'll get to find out something

82
00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.039
about the person the president was scheduled to meet today too.

83
00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.539
I guess so.

84
00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:36.939
I think it'll be okay

85
00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:37.939
if you're escorted by a police officer?

86
00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.039
As for Hal,

87
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.339
I'll have to ask you to cancel today's class.

88
00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.339
If so, I'd like to tell the prep school head

89
00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.139
the reason I'm not teaching today in person

90
00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.139
since it's really nearby.

91
00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:54.639
Yes.

92
00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.039
-Chiba. -He will escort Irina

93
00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.539
and he will accompany Hal.

94
00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.239
Let's go, then.

95
00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.439
I mean there's a dead man here

96
00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.939
and they're more concerned about their class and party.

97
00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.439
Some nerve.

98
00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.939
Don't you think so, Inspector?

99
00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.839
I see. That's the story.

100
00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:22.139
That's why the killer took the memo with him.

101
00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.239
-What the heck! -Huh? What's wrong?

102
00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.439
I figured that maybe Shu would be able

103
00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.939
to figure out the meaning of the tuxedo memo,

104
00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.839
but my cell phone hasn't been working well since this morning

105
00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.239
and I can't get through.

106
00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:35.639
Jodie?

107
00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.539
I'll lend you my cell phone for a while then.

108
00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:39.739
You don't mind?

109
00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:43.439
The email addresses and phone numbers are in here, aren't they?

110
00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.239
It's okay.

111
00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.639
As for the mails, I moved the data the other day.

112
00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.639
And as to the phone numbers,

113
00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.839
as long as I pull out the SIM card,

114
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.339
no one can look at them.

115
00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.839
If you insert the SIM card of your cell phone,

116
00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.739
it'll become your cell phone.

117
00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:02.039
Since my cell phone is the same type as yours.

118
00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.339
But won't it be inconvenient for you,

119
00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:05.839
not having your cell phone?

120
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.239
No problem.

121
00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.539
Because I have another one.

122
00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:10.939
Thank you.

123
00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.039
Then, I'll use it for now.

124
00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.339
But, doesn't it seem kind of strange?

125
00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.439
On the outside, it's changed and of a different shape,

126
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.339
yet the contents of the cell phone

127
00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.939
is what you've been using for a long time and know very well.

128
00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:26.539
-Huh? -Just what're you talking about?

129
00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:28.139
You know...

130
00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.939
Just like Mr. Camel who was actually a FBI agent,

131
00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:34.739
we should never judge anything by its cover.

132
00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.539
Thank you.

133
00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.439
Thanks to you, I've solved the mystery of that memo.

134
00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.339
I hate to butt in when you're all elated,

135
00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.639
but will you explain it so that a man like me can understand it too?

136
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.539
Okay, I'll explain.

137
00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:53.439
There's a magic spell

138
00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.539
that will tell you who the culprit is at once.

139
00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:57.139
Magic spell?

140
00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:58.739
Are you saying that chanting that spell

141
00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:00.639
will reveal the culprit?

142
00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:01.739
Yep.

143
00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:04.839
Although we need to get a lot of things ready.

144
00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:06.339
Ready?

145
00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:09.139
First we need chairs for the number of people involved.

146
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.339
That's all you have to say.

147
00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:14.539
Easy, right?

148
00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:17.939
Are you really sure, we can find the culprit by doing so?

149
00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:20.639
Yep. I'm sure because it's a magic spell

150
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.639
that Shinichi told me about.

151
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.439
Try it.

152
00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:25.839
If Kudo's the one who said so,

153
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.439
it just might work.

154
00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.839
Hey, Conan.

155
00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:31.939
What's the spell that will reveal the culprit?

156
00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:34.339
Tell us...

157
00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:37.239
That's why all we need to say in front of the suspects is...

158
00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:42.639
Liar.

159
00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:44.039
You gotta be kidding.

160
00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.839
If that will reveal the culprit,

161
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.739
who needs the police?

162
00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.439
That's what I figured they'd say.

163
00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:53.139
So what is it you're really supposed to say?

164
00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:55.539
Tell us, without putting us on.

165
00:08:55.539 --> 00:08:58.339
I mean, I'm serious. That's what to say.

166
00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.539
Officer Takagi.

167
00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:02.939
Huh?

168
00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:05.539
Just watch.

169
00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:08.839
Will you go get four chairs for the four suspects?

170
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.939
Oh, but I think it would be better for them to come to the station

171
00:09:10.939 --> 00:09:12.739
if we're going to interrogate them.

172
00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:13.839
No.

173
00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:16.039
It's to determine who the culprit is.

174
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.139
As long as they're there, it will become obvious.

175
00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:20.239
What? Really?

176
00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:23.839
Yeah, most probably.

177
00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:27.239
"Haido Central Hospital"

178
00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:41.239
Tonight at 19:00.

179
00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:45.639
Raiha Pass where the seventh left curve ends.

180
00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.939
At this hour of the night,

181
00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:49.939
there aren't many cars going by that pass.

182
00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:54.639
Just the perfect place for a secret meeting.

183
00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:57.839
Are you sure, you're going to be okay?

184
00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:01.439
Yes, please believe me.

185
00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:03.139
And, of course, her.

186
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.539
Akai.

187
00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.039
Okay, then, please take care of things.

188
00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:17.439
I'm counting on you.

189
00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:19.539
Yeah.

190
00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:55.692
Inspector Megure, everything's set in place.

191
00:10:55.692 --> 00:10:57.192
Okay.

192
00:10:57.192 --> 00:11:00.392
Will the four suspects go

193
00:11:00.392 --> 00:11:02.492
and stand in front of your respective chairs?

194
00:11:02.492 --> 00:11:04.592
What're you going to do?

195
00:11:04.592 --> 00:11:06.892
It's kind of scary.

196
00:11:06.892 --> 00:11:07.892
If you're going to interrogate us,

197
00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:09.892
wouldn't one to a room be better?

198
00:11:09.892 --> 00:11:13.492
Well, let's do as the Inspector says.

199
00:11:13.492 --> 00:11:15.292
It's not like he's going to ask us to play musical chair

200
00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:16.992
or anything so.

201
00:11:16.992 --> 00:11:19.992
Oh, please don't sit yet.

202
00:11:19.992 --> 00:11:22.592
I wonder if he's really going to say that magic spell?

203
00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:24.192
No, he won't.

204
00:11:24.192 --> 00:11:26.492
He'll be the laughing stock if he does.

205
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.692
Now that all four of you are here, first...

206
00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:52.592
Shiraunplee!

207
00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:10.992
How come you guys are all sitting down?

208
00:12:10.992 --> 00:12:14.992
Oh, because the Inspector just said...

209
00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:29.492
Sit down please.

210
00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:31.292
That's what the word Shiraunplee sounds like

211
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:32.692
to the ears of foreigners

212
00:12:32.692 --> 00:12:34.292
who are used listening to English.

213
00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:36.892
It sounds like the English.

214
00:12:36.892 --> 00:12:39.392
Sit down please.

215
00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:42.492
More so, if they're standing in front of chairs.

216
00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:47.292
In other words, he looks like a foreigner,

217
00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:49.092
but he's Japanese inside.

218
00:12:49.092 --> 00:12:52.192
And, if the person is not used to hearing English,

219
00:12:52.192 --> 00:12:53.392
it would sound like what it's really supposed to mean,

220
00:12:53.392 --> 00:12:56.892
that is the Japanese word play innocent.

221
00:12:56.892 --> 00:12:59.992
Do you know what this means?

222
00:12:59.992 --> 00:13:01.192
Mr. murderer.

223
00:13:03.292 --> 00:13:04.892
-Murderer? -Him?

224
00:13:04.892 --> 00:13:09.292
-Why? -Agent Jodie...

225
00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:11.692
I still don't understand what is going on.

226
00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:13.292
Neither do I.

227
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.792
Let me go over the case, okay?

228
00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:16.892
The one who was shot

229
00:13:16.892 --> 00:13:19.792
is the president of a foreigner's talent production.

230
00:13:19.792 --> 00:13:22.992
From the fact that the president was supposed to meet

231
00:13:22.992 --> 00:13:25.592
a new foreign talent today.

232
00:13:25.592 --> 00:13:27.692
Because the police arrived to the site of the scene right away,

233
00:13:27.692 --> 00:13:29.192
there were four suspects,

234
00:13:29.192 --> 00:13:32.692
his secretary, Irina who was the first to find him.

235
00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:35.592
Then foreigners who were in this hotel at the time of the crime,

236
00:13:35.592 --> 00:13:38.792
English teacher, Mr. Hal Buckner.

237
00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:41.292
Mr. Toby Keynes, the model.

238
00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:45.392
And for some reason, the man who was training on the stairs,

239
00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:49.092
FBI agent, Mr. Andre Camel.

240
00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:51.892
The clue is the thing that was on top the president's desk,

241
00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:54.592
a memo paper that had been torn off.

242
00:13:54.592 --> 00:13:56.592
Because there were blood stains

243
00:13:56.592 --> 00:13:59.492
on the president's hand and the edge of the memo,

244
00:13:59.492 --> 00:14:02.892
it was deduced that the president wrote something just before he died,

245
00:14:02.892 --> 00:14:05.692
and that memo was taken away by the murderer.

246
00:14:05.692 --> 00:14:07.092
And from the traces of what was left on the paper below the memo,

247
00:14:07.092 --> 00:14:10.992
the words, bring my tux.

248
00:14:10.992 --> 00:14:14.192
The phrase please bring my tuxedo was thought out.

249
00:14:14.192 --> 00:14:16.492
According to his secretary, Irina,

250
00:14:16.492 --> 00:14:19.792
the president was scheduled to attend a party today

251
00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:23.092
and the memo was probably a message

252
00:14:23.092 --> 00:14:25.292
that the president had left for her.

253
00:14:25.292 --> 00:14:27.592
You already understand, don't you?

254
00:14:27.592 --> 00:14:31.392
So, why did the killer take a plain memo away?

255
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.692
I get it!

256
00:14:32.692 --> 00:14:34.792
It's because he couldn't read the English!

257
00:14:35.892 --> 00:14:38.192
The murder couldn't understand the memo,

258
00:14:38.192 --> 00:14:41.292
so he got scared and took it with him.

259
00:14:41.292 --> 00:14:44.892
It's most likely that after the murderer shot the president,

260
00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:47.292
he was looking for something,

261
00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:49.092
but realized that the president

262
00:14:49.092 --> 00:14:53.192
was holding a pen and a memo paper.

263
00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:55.892
Thinking that something had been written about himself,

264
00:14:55.892 --> 00:14:58.592
the killer hastily tore off the memo sheet and took it with him.

265
00:14:58.592 --> 00:15:02.492
However, the president was already dead at that time.

266
00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:04.792
If it were a person who could read English,

267
00:15:04.792 --> 00:15:06.192
he could see right away

268
00:15:06.192 --> 00:15:08.292
that it was just a message to the president's secretary.

269
00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:11.092
In other words, the man who teaches English at a prep school,

270
00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:12.992
Mr. Hal Buckner,

271
00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:15.392
and the secretary who was corresponding with the president in English,

272
00:15:15.392 --> 00:15:16.892
Irina,

273
00:15:16.892 --> 00:15:20.792
and FBI agent, Mr. Camel can all be marked off the suspect list.

274
00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:23.892
The one who most probably walked off with the memo sheet

275
00:15:23.892 --> 00:15:26.192
is the man who is presumed to not have been able to read English,

276
00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:28.492
Mr. Toby Keynes.

277
00:15:28.492 --> 00:15:30.892
He's the only likely one left.

278
00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.892
Where's the proof?

279
00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:40.392
Don't tell me that you're going to make a murderer out of me

280
00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:42.892
just because I don't understand English?

281
00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:46.692
What would you guys do?

282
00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:50.092
If you see a memo sheet with bad things written about you on it.

283
00:15:50.092 --> 00:15:52.292
I'd probably throw it away as soon as I pick it up.

284
00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:53.892
I'd be pissed.

285
00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:56.092
I wouldn't even want to read it.

286
00:15:56.092 --> 00:15:58.992
But, what if it was written in a code

287
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.792
or something that you don't understand?

288
00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:02.992
Then, I would never throw it away.

289
00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:05.792
I'd be concerned about what's written.

290
00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:08.292
I'd take it home and check up on in.

291
00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:11.392
Then the murderer most probably...

292
00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:15.492
Excuse me, let me check you.

293
00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:21.092
Here it is!

294
00:16:21.092 --> 00:16:22.092
Inspector!

295
00:16:26.892 --> 00:16:28.592
I was going to take it home

296
00:16:28.592 --> 00:16:31.392
and ask my American girlfriend's younger brother

297
00:16:31.392 --> 00:16:35.192
what was written on it.

298
00:16:35.192 --> 00:16:36.692
Girlfriend?

299
00:16:36.692 --> 00:16:38.592
Yeah, my girlfriend.

300
00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:40.592
I can't ask her directly anymore,

301
00:16:40.592 --> 00:16:42.892
because after being slave driven by the president,

302
00:16:42.892 --> 00:16:48.992
she died at the end of last year from over work.

303
00:16:48.992 --> 00:16:50.592
Slave-driven?

304
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:52.392
Right.

305
00:16:52.392 --> 00:16:55.892
She was made to sign a contract that was written in Japanese.

306
00:16:55.892 --> 00:16:59.292
She could speak a little Japanese,

307
00:16:59.292 --> 00:17:01.492
but couldn't read at all.

308
00:17:01.492 --> 00:17:04.692
Moreover, it was a contract binding her brother as joint guarantor,

309
00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:09.092
to take full responsibility if she ended up not being able to work.

310
00:17:09.092 --> 00:17:11.892
So, I came here wanting to at least save her younger brother

311
00:17:11.892 --> 00:17:13.092
and threatened the president with a gun,

312
00:17:13.092 --> 00:17:16.592
hoping to get hold of the contract.

313
00:17:16.592 --> 00:17:19.892
I made him scout me out in the city.

314
00:17:19.892 --> 00:17:23.292
He had the nerve to say that he didn't have the contract

315
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:26.492
and he'd have his secretary bring it over,

316
00:17:26.492 --> 00:17:29.892
so I inadvertently ended up pulling the trigger.

317
00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:30.892
Which means...

318
00:17:30.892 --> 00:17:34.392
that the file the president asked me to get was...

319
00:17:34.392 --> 00:17:38.892
Yeah, the contract she signed should also be in it.

320
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:42.792
If I knew that his secretary was a girl like you,

321
00:17:42.792 --> 00:17:45.792
I guess I didn't have to kill him.

322
00:17:47.992 --> 00:17:51.292
But that Shiraunplee thing really got me.

323
00:17:51.292 --> 00:17:52.792
How did you figure it out?

324
00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:54.992
That I'm a foreign looking man who is 100% Japanese,

325
00:17:54.992 --> 00:17:57.992
unable to speak a word of English?

326
00:17:57.992 --> 00:17:58.992
Reception.

327
00:17:58.992 --> 00:18:00.192
Huh?

328
00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:02.392
Reception.

329
00:18:02.392 --> 00:18:06.392
When the secretary left saying she was going to the hotel's reception,

330
00:18:06.392 --> 00:18:08.092
Toby, you said...

331
00:18:10.992 --> 00:18:13.292
I mean there's a dead man here

332
00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:16.392
and they're more concerned about their class and party.

333
00:18:16.392 --> 00:18:18.492
Some nerve.

334
00:18:18.492 --> 00:18:22.692
Right. When a foreigner says hotel's reception,

335
00:18:22.692 --> 00:18:25.792
it's equivalent to the front desk of a hotel in Japanese.

336
00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:29.792
That's how I figured out you couldn't speak English, Toby.

337
00:18:31.192 --> 00:18:32.892
It means the front desk.

338
00:18:32.892 --> 00:18:35.492
I thought that something wasn't right.

339
00:18:35.492 --> 00:18:36.792
Looking back at things,

340
00:18:36.792 --> 00:18:41.192
maybe I should've had my American father teach me more English.

341
00:18:41.192 --> 00:18:44.792
All I learned from my father was how to shoot a gun.

342
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.892
How to shoot a gun?

343
00:18:47.892 --> 00:18:51.792
Yeah, because he belong to the US-Japan troop

344
00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:53.592
stationed here in Japan.

345
00:18:53.592 --> 00:18:55.892
Although my father didn't want to,

346
00:18:55.892 --> 00:18:57.192
when we went on a trip to Guam,

347
00:18:57.192 --> 00:18:59.992
I begged him to teach me.

348
00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:05.292
But, I wish he taught me more...

349
00:19:05.292 --> 00:19:07.192
of what shooting a person,

350
00:19:07.192 --> 00:19:09.692
and what the consequences could be.

351
00:19:09.692 --> 00:19:12.792
I never ever want to go through this again.

352
00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:14.492
Every time I pull the trigger,

353
00:19:14.492 --> 00:19:17.292
it feels like I'm losing my soul

354
00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:19.892
that super revolting feeling.

355
00:19:22.692 --> 00:19:25.492
"Mouri Detective Agency"

356
00:19:25.492 --> 00:19:28.292
Conan and dad really are like fired bullets

357
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:30.492
that never come back once they go out.

358
00:19:30.492 --> 00:19:33.692
No dinner for them tonight.

359
00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.292
New York.

360
00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:41.692
FBI?

361
00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:45.692
Come to think of it, that person I met back then was also...

362
00:19:50.092 --> 00:19:54.092
A Japanese person with long hair?

363
00:20:06.792 --> 00:20:09.192
What? A gun?

364
00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:13.292
My body...

365
00:20:13.292 --> 00:20:15.992
won't move.

366
00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:17.192
Hey, hurry up!

367
00:20:17.192 --> 00:20:20.592
Jump in! He must be the serial killer!

368
00:20:20.592 --> 00:20:22.692
But...

369
00:20:22.692 --> 00:20:26.692
Shinichi's still inside.

370
00:20:28.392 --> 00:20:29.492
What the...

371
00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:31.892
Oh, hey...

372
00:20:31.892 --> 00:20:32.992
Are you Japanese?

373
00:20:35.292 --> 00:20:38.192
I'm asking you, are you Japanese?

374
00:20:38.192 --> 00:20:40.392
Oh, yes.

375
00:20:40.392 --> 00:20:42.292
Did you see a suspicious looking man?

376
00:20:42.292 --> 00:20:43.792
Huh?

377
00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:48.092
A Japanese man with long hair dyed silver.

378
00:20:48.092 --> 00:20:51.092
No, nobody like that.

379
00:20:53.792 --> 00:20:55.192
Did you find him, sir?

380
00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:56.992
No.

381
00:20:56.992 --> 00:20:58.792
At any rate, this place is dangerous.

382
00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:00.392
Turn right on the corner over there

383
00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:01.892
and you'll come out to the main street.

384
00:21:01.892 --> 00:21:03.692
Hail a cab there.

385
00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:07.492
Oh, but I'm waiting here for my friend.

386
00:21:07.492 --> 00:21:10.492
He's a high school sophomore like me.

387
00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:13.592
Let me tell you as well as that friend again.

388
00:21:17.292 --> 00:21:20.092
Get lost! Get out of here, quick!

389
00:21:28.292 --> 00:21:31.092
He was a FBI agent.

390
00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:33.292
And once more...

391
00:21:42.292 --> 00:21:44.192
You're crying again.

392
00:21:44.192 --> 00:21:45.892
Huh?

393
00:21:45.892 --> 00:21:49.192
You're always crying.

394
00:21:49.192 --> 00:21:51.592
Does it bother you?

395
00:21:51.592 --> 00:21:53.792
No.

396
00:21:55.492 --> 00:21:57.792
You just remind me...

397
00:21:57.792 --> 00:21:59.892
of a woman who closely resembled you.

398
00:22:01.892 --> 00:22:04.892
A stupid woman who feigned composure,

399
00:22:04.892 --> 00:22:07.092
but used to cry when no one was watching.

400
00:22:08.392 --> 00:22:11.792
A woman who closely resembles me.

401
00:22:11.792 --> 00:22:14.692
I wonder who he was referring to.

402
00:22:22.192 --> 00:22:23.792
Do I have to tell you how I feel, for you to understand?

403
00:24:10.392 --> 00:24:11.492
"Next Episode"

404
00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:12.992
Did the strings that were connected

405
00:24:12.992 --> 00:24:16.092
become a double-edged sword?

406
00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:18.392
Who will outfox the other,

407
00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:21.892
who will triumph and laugh at the end?

408
00:24:21.892 --> 00:24:24.792
What is the meaning of their last conversation?

409
00:24:24.792 --> 00:24:27.792
When will the mystery be solved?

410
00:24:27.792 --> 00:24:30.992
The long Friday the 13th ends.

411
00:24:32.892 --> 00:24:35.892
Next on Detective Conan,

412
00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:40.392
"Red and Black Crash: Killed on Duty"

413
00:24:56.192 --> 00:24:58.392
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:58.392 --> 00:25:00.592
Bullet.

415
00:25:00.592 --> 00:25:03.892
Everybody, don't forget FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

416
00:25:03.892 --> 00:25:05.392
What do you mean?
