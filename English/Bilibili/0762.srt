1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.540
We came to Kanazawa to help out with a town revitalization event

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.140
called the "Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour".

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.640
We went around visiting checkpoints

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.940
as we would during the actual event.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.140
Thief!

6
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.940
Darn it! You'll pay for this!

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.140
However, the purse snatcher appears once again,

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.240
and attacks Pops Mouri.

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.040
Or so we thought.

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
It turned out to be a candid camera performance.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.540
But, soon after that...

12
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Akiyama.

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.940
Harumi?

14
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.840
Harumi!

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.840
Okay!

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.640
Hey, don't film this!

18
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.040
This is not an act. It's for real.

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.640
What?

20
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.840
It's not candid camera?

21
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.540
Then, why was Ms. Akiyama?

22
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.040
It doesn't look to be a robbery.

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.840
If this was the doing of a spree killer killing at random,

24
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.740
it's strange that there aren't any other victims.

25
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.140
Then, the killer specifically went after Ms. Akiyama.

26
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.640
Just what is the meaning of this?

27
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.840
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

28
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.740
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

29
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.840
Candid camera filming develops into a case!

30
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.740
Kogoro makes a fantastic deduction in the footbath!

31
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.540
His name is Detective Conan.

34
00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:41.378
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kaga Hot Spring part)"

35
00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:45.578
"Harumi Akiyama (29)"

36
00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:54.878
Wait. Ms. Akiyama's bag.

37
00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:05.478
This is...

38
00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:10.478
Will someone please accompany her?

39
00:04:10.478 --> 00:04:13.878
Ran, you go.

40
00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.278
But...

41
00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:19.378
Shouldn't Mr. Kuranishi, her fiance, go instead of me?

42
00:04:19.378 --> 00:04:22.478
They all still have work to do.

43
00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:24.478
Please don't worry.

44
00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:28.478
-"Osamu Kuranishi (33)" -Let's continue visiting the checkpoints.

45
00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:30.678
-"Moeko Miyazawa (27)" -Is that all right?

46
00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:32.178
Yes.

47
00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:33.778
-"Yuzo Tanimoto (57)" -I guess so.

48
00:04:33.778 --> 00:04:36.378
Mr. Kuranishi may be worried but...

49
00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:40.978
-"Yuya Tadokoro (48)" -Please take care of Akiyama, Ran.

50
00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:42.678
I will.

51
00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:44.678
I'll be going.

52
00:04:44.678 --> 00:04:49.078
I wonder if Pops thinks that someone here is the culprit?

53
00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:53.378
That's why to keep anyone from fleeing, Ran was sent over instead.

54
00:04:53.378 --> 00:04:56.978
"The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa"

55
00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:01.478
Why'd something like this have to happen?

56
00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:02.878
Don't worry.

57
00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:05.278
I'm sure Akiyama will be okay.

58
00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:08.978
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

59
00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:10.878
No, let's contact the police

60
00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:16.378
after seeing how things turn out with Akiyama first.

61
00:05:16.378 --> 00:05:19.278
Knock it off!

62
00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:21.878
I'm not the culprit.

63
00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:25.778
I'm just saying so because by reporting this to the police,

64
00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:28.578
it may badly affect the event.

65
00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.078
I know, Mr. Tanimoto.

66
00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:33.978
Nobody's accusing you.

67
00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:37.578
If you get too flustered, it'll make you look more suspicious.

68
00:05:37.578 --> 00:05:39.478
Hey, hey.

69
00:05:42.278 --> 00:05:44.578
Hey, Pops.

70
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:50.678
May I look at the code cards you received from Ms. Akiyama?

71
00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:51.678
These?

72
00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.178
Thank you.

73
00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:54.978
I've got to go to the restroom.

74
00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:09.678
These cards that fell out of Ms. Akiyama's bag

75
00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:14.178
are probably the code cards she originally had ready.

76
00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:18.078
Why did she lie and say she lost the cards

77
00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:21.478
and make new code cards?

78
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:34.878
Now for the next news.

79
00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:37.878
On May 6, 2010, the man suspected to attacked

80
00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:40.078
an elderly man who lived alone

81
00:06:40.078 --> 00:06:43.478
and robbed of five million yen in Kanazawa...

82
00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:47.478
I see. So, that's the story.

83
00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:05.778
He's probably the one who attacked Ms. Akiyama.

84
00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:09.078
But, I don't have evidence to prove it.

85
00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:12.378
The next checkpoint is the last one.

86
00:07:12.378 --> 00:07:14.178
But because of what happened to Ms. Akiyama,

87
00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:15.778
we have no more code cards.

88
00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:18.178
Therefore, let me give you the destination.

89
00:07:18.178 --> 00:07:20.378
Next we're going to Yamashiro Hot Spring's

90
00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:22.878
-"Rosanjin's Iroha Soan" -Iroha Soan.

91
00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.478
So...

92
00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:29.878
We've visited all the checkpoints.

93
00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:31.578
At the actually event,

94
00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:37.278
the participants would have received all the hint needed at this point.

95
00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:39.378
The participants will deduce

96
00:07:39.378 --> 00:07:42.178
who the culprit is using those hints.

97
00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:43.778
How was it, Mr. Mouri?

98
00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:46.178
Have you come up with a good case?

99
00:07:46.178 --> 00:07:48.678
Well...

100
00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:52.478
I guess.

101
00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:55.378
What a beautiful garden.

102
00:07:55.378 --> 00:07:57.078
Hey, Pops.

103
00:07:57.078 --> 00:08:00.078
About the footage that was filmed for candid camera...

104
00:08:00.078 --> 00:08:02.278
If it's going to be used to advertise the event,

105
00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:04.778
don't you think we should check it beforehand?

106
00:08:06.478 --> 00:08:07.878
You're right.

107
00:08:07.878 --> 00:08:09.878
Will you do that for us?

108
00:08:09.878 --> 00:08:12.878
Sure, no problem.

109
00:08:13.978 --> 00:08:15.678
Thief!

110
00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:19.978
Darn it.

111
00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:22.278
You'll pay for this!

112
00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:25.678
Idiot!

113
00:08:27.978 --> 00:08:30.178
Are you all right, Mr. Mouri?

114
00:08:30.178 --> 00:08:31.978
Yes. Of course.

115
00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:34.878
What an insolent fellow, though.

116
00:08:34.878 --> 00:08:39.278
Kanazawa is supposed to be a safe place, and yet...

117
00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:43.378
Mr. Tanimoto, you're looking straight at the camera!

118
00:08:43.378 --> 00:08:44.578
Well...

119
00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:47.678
We, as the Tourist Bureau need to get this message across.

120
00:08:47.678 --> 00:08:49.478
You'll pay for what you did!

121
00:08:53.078 --> 00:08:55.278
You're the thief I saw a while ago!

122
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.678
Hold it!

123
00:08:58.678 --> 00:08:59.778
Harumi?

124
00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:01.978
Harumi!

125
00:09:01.978 --> 00:09:04.778
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

126
00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:05.878
Okay!

127
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.878
Hey, don't film this!

128
00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:10.178
This is not an act. It's for real.

129
00:09:10.178 --> 00:09:11.278
What?

130
00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:14.278
No good.

131
00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:18.978
I wonder how Ms. Akiyama's doing?

132
00:09:18.978 --> 00:09:21.278
Let me ask Ran.

133
00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:24.278
"Kanazawa East Hospital"

134
00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:26.378
Please take care.

135
00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:28.478
Thank you very much.

136
00:09:35.478 --> 00:09:38.078
Hello, Dad?

137
00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.378
I see.

138
00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:43.478
Then, Ms. Akiyama's wound wasn't all that serious?

139
00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:48.778
It seems she's going to have to stay a night just to be sure

140
00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:51.178
and have her brain examined.

141
00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:54.578
Okay. I'm glad it wasn't that serious.

142
00:09:54.578 --> 00:09:57.078
Pops, put me on!

143
00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:01.678
Hello, Ran?

144
00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:02.778
Conan?

145
00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:04.078
Huh?

146
00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:07.778
The reception's bad.

147
00:10:07.778 --> 00:10:09.878
Hello...

148
00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:14.778
Ran, I've got a favour to ask you.

149
00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:18.278
Dad?

150
00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:21.178
Okay...

151
00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:22.478
What?

152
00:10:25.278 --> 00:10:26.478
Okay.

153
00:10:26.478 --> 00:10:28.278
That's what you want me to do?

154
00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:29.778
All right. See you.

155
00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:35.978
Thank you. I'll give these back to you!

156
00:10:35.978 --> 00:10:39.078
Don't go taking my cell phone without asking!

157
00:10:41.778 --> 00:10:42.778
What is it, Ran?

158
00:10:42.778 --> 00:10:44.478
You still have something...

159
00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:47.478
What?

160
00:10:47.478 --> 00:10:50.878
Ms. Akiyama left her room?

161
00:10:50.878 --> 00:10:52.078
-What? -What?

162
00:11:05.328 --> 00:11:08.228
Harumi snuck out of the hospital?

163
00:11:08.228 --> 00:11:09.228
Yes.

164
00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:13.028
Ran left the hospital room to talk to me on the phone,

165
00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:14.728
and it seems that Ms. Akiyama snuck out then.

166
00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:18.328
She left a note saying that there was something she had to confess,

167
00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:22.128
so she'd be going to Yamashiro.

168
00:11:22.128 --> 00:11:24.528
She's coming this way.

169
00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:31.328
Kuranishi, did you contact Akiyama?

170
00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:35.328
Yes. But, I get no answer on my text mail and...

171
00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:37.128
I can't get through to her on the phone either.

172
00:11:37.128 --> 00:11:41.728
But, I wonder what it is that she wants to confess?

173
00:11:41.728 --> 00:11:43.428
I'm sure that

174
00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:45.328
she either saw the face of the culprit

175
00:11:45.328 --> 00:11:47.328
or something like that.

176
00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:54.028
At any rate, let's split up and go look for her.

177
00:12:14.428 --> 00:12:16.128
"Don't be hasty. Let's talk. Where are you?"

178
00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:20.328
"I'm waiting at the spring footbath."

179
00:12:20.328 --> 00:12:23.328
Hey, do you know where the scissor that was over here is?

180
00:12:23.328 --> 00:12:24.828
No, I don't.

181
00:12:47.028 --> 00:12:48.528
This way!

182
00:12:58.328 --> 00:12:59.628
Ran?

183
00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:02.228
What's going on?

184
00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:05.928
Dad called me and instructed me to do so.

185
00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:07.728
He told me to disguise myself as Ms. Akiyama

186
00:13:07.728 --> 00:13:12.028
and lure the culprit out.

187
00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:14.628
Ran. I...

188
00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:16.928
Stop thinking about anything for now.

189
00:13:16.928 --> 00:13:19.828
And rest well.

190
00:13:19.828 --> 00:13:24.228
I'm going to borrow your smart phone and coat, all right?

191
00:13:25.928 --> 00:13:27.328
Hey, wait.

192
00:13:27.328 --> 00:13:28.828
I didn't say anything like...

193
00:13:30.428 --> 00:13:33.228
Why you...

194
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:34.328
It's back.

195
00:13:34.328 --> 00:13:36.228
This is bad!

196
00:13:36.228 --> 00:13:38.328
Pops, if you're going inside the footbath,

197
00:13:38.328 --> 00:13:40.028
you've got to take your socks and shoes off.

198
00:13:43.828 --> 00:13:44.828
Yes.

199
00:13:44.828 --> 00:13:47.928
I did instruct Ran to do so.

200
00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:50.128
What about Harumi, then?

201
00:13:50.128 --> 00:13:52.528
She's asleep at the hospital room.

202
00:13:52.528 --> 00:13:54.228
Hey, Kuranishi!

203
00:13:54.228 --> 00:13:56.428
Did you attack Akiyama?

204
00:13:56.428 --> 00:13:58.528
Why on earth did you do something like that?

205
00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:06.428
Let me explain that to you in his place.

206
00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:09.428
The first thing that I noticed was

207
00:14:09.428 --> 00:14:13.228
when Ms. Akiyama was carried onto the stretcher,

208
00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:16.228
she wasn't wearing her wristwatch.

209
00:14:16.228 --> 00:14:19.328
But, Ms. Akiyama until right before that...

210
00:14:19.328 --> 00:14:21.428
We're a bit pressed for time,

211
00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:24.628
so let's head to The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa.

212
00:14:24.628 --> 00:14:27.128
Since the watch wasn't found at the scene of the crime,

213
00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:30.528
it's only likely that the culprit took it with him.

214
00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:32.328
But, why?

215
00:14:32.328 --> 00:14:36.528
Then I remembered what Ms. Miyazawa had said.

216
00:14:36.528 --> 00:14:40.628
Ms. Akiyama and I were secretly filming all of you.

217
00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:41.728
In other words,

218
00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:45.528
the hidden camera that Ms. Akiyama in charge of

219
00:14:45.528 --> 00:14:49.628
was built in to the wristwatch, wasn't it?

220
00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:51.028
You're right!

221
00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:55.728
There was a small camera built in to Akiyama's wristwatch!

222
00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.428
Mr. Kuranishi,

223
00:14:57.428 --> 00:15:01.028
I'll bet you remembered that after you committed the crime?

224
00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:06.228
You were worried that the camera had filmed it.

225
00:15:06.228 --> 00:15:08.128
Because of this,

226
00:15:08.128 --> 00:15:12.028
didn't you pretended to take Ms. Akiyama's pulse, take off her wristwatch

227
00:15:12.028 --> 00:15:14.828
and take it with you?

228
00:15:14.828 --> 00:15:18.028
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

229
00:15:19.628 --> 00:15:23.228
When Conan suggested looking at the secretly filmed footage,

230
00:15:23.228 --> 00:15:24.828
I was watching carefully,

231
00:15:24.828 --> 00:15:30.128
thinking the time you took the wrist watch from her hand

232
00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:33.428
may have been filmed.

233
00:15:33.428 --> 00:15:35.928
But it wasn't.

234
00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:37.128
Therefore,

235
00:15:37.128 --> 00:15:41.228
as a last resort, I had Ran put on an act.

236
00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:44.828
Kuranishi, did you really do it?

237
00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:48.028
Why?

238
00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:51.028
She's your fiance, isn't she?

239
00:15:51.028 --> 00:15:52.928
The reason was

240
00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:54.228
to keep her from talking about the incident

241
00:15:54.228 --> 00:15:55.828
that happened four years ago.

242
00:15:55.828 --> 00:15:57.928
Keep her from talking?

243
00:15:57.928 --> 00:15:58.928
Yes.

244
00:15:58.928 --> 00:16:01.228
It's the case that was aired on the news this afternoon.

245
00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.628
About the elderly man living alone,

246
00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:09.528
who was robbed of five million yen.

247
00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:12.128
What does the case that happened four years ago

248
00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:15.028
have to do with what happened this time?

249
00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:19.328
Ms. Akiyama herself told me

250
00:16:19.328 --> 00:16:21.928
by using those code cards.

251
00:16:21.928 --> 00:16:23.028
What?

252
00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:25.228
The code cards?

253
00:16:25.228 --> 00:16:27.328
After she heard the news,

254
00:16:27.328 --> 00:16:30.428
Ms. Akiyama said that she lost the code cards

255
00:16:30.428 --> 00:16:33.128
and newly rewrote them.

256
00:16:33.128 --> 00:16:37.928
However, she didn't lose the code cards.

257
00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:39.528
Conan picked the cards that fell out of her bag

258
00:16:39.528 --> 00:16:45.528
and onto the ground at the scene of the crime.

259
00:16:45.528 --> 00:16:48.328
These are the original code cards.

260
00:16:48.328 --> 00:16:51.228
These are the ones that have been newly rewritten.

261
00:16:56.128 --> 00:16:57.528
As you can see,

262
00:16:57.528 --> 00:17:00.928
the three codes that were newly handwritten are different

263
00:17:00.928 --> 00:17:04.728
from the ones that have been originally prepared beforehand.

264
00:17:04.728 --> 00:17:06.928
As to these three code cards,

265
00:17:06.928 --> 00:17:09.728
I figured that besides indicating the checkpoints,

266
00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:14.028
they may include another message.

267
00:17:15.128 --> 00:17:16.328
As for the first code,

268
00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:20.128
if you replace 1056 to mean the year and date.

269
00:17:20.128 --> 00:17:23.828
It can be read, 2015, May (5) 6.

270
00:17:23.828 --> 00:17:26.328
The letter "G" and the Sword (Ken)

271
00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:28.628
can be read as "Jiken"

272
00:17:28.628 --> 00:17:31.128
that means case in Japanese.

273
00:17:31.128 --> 00:17:35.428
The year 2010, May 6, case?

274
00:17:35.428 --> 00:17:39.028
That's indeed the case that was being aired on TV.

275
00:17:39.028 --> 00:17:41.728
As for the second code.

276
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.728
The bottom half of the diamond shape

277
00:17:43.728 --> 00:17:46.328
and the diagram of the arrowhead are black,

278
00:17:46.328 --> 00:17:51.228
and there is a plus sign only between these two shapes.

279
00:17:51.228 --> 00:17:56.128
When you place one shape over the other.

280
00:17:56.128 --> 00:18:00.228
The blackened part forms a star.

281
00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:02.028
"Hoshi" means star in Japanese

282
00:18:02.028 --> 00:18:05.628
and it is police jargon as well, meaning culprit.

283
00:18:05.628 --> 00:18:06.928
In other words...

284
00:18:06.928 --> 00:18:08.228
Star and saddle means Hoshikura.

285
00:18:10.728 --> 00:18:13.528
Then, the final code.

286
00:18:13.528 --> 00:18:16.828
If you read this as is without calculating it,

287
00:18:16.828 --> 00:18:18.828
it's read, "nishi-san".

288
00:18:18.828 --> 00:18:22.528
If you join these codes together and read them.

289
00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:27.628
"The year 2010, May 6th", "case", "culprit",

290
00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:29.528
"Kuranishi-san".

291
00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:38.028
The real culprit of that case was Mr. Kuranishi.

292
00:18:38.028 --> 00:18:42.928
It seems like Ms. Akiyama knew about this, right?

293
00:18:42.928 --> 00:18:45.528
I don't know where she got the information,

294
00:18:45.528 --> 00:18:48.928
but she kept quiet all this time about it.

295
00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:50.328
However...

296
00:18:50.328 --> 00:18:53.328
But, if it turns out to be a false charge,

297
00:18:53.328 --> 00:18:55.028
it's no laughing matter, right?

298
00:18:55.028 --> 00:18:58.628
That person's life would be ruined.

299
00:19:00.528 --> 00:19:01.828
If left as is,

300
00:19:01.828 --> 00:19:05.128
an innocent person may be mistaken for the culprit.

301
00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:07.928
Not wanting this to happen,

302
00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:11.728
Ms. Akiyama probably decided to confess the truth.

303
00:19:11.728 --> 00:19:14.728
And, in order to try to stop her from doing so,

304
00:19:14.728 --> 00:19:19.028
isn't that why you attacked Ms. Akiyama?

305
00:19:26.128 --> 00:19:28.428
Exactly.

306
00:19:28.428 --> 00:19:31.928
I warned Harumi on the spur of the moment by text mail.

307
00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:33.928
"If they find out, you'll be complicit, too."

308
00:19:37.128 --> 00:19:42.528
That's why Ms. Akiyama used codes to inform me

309
00:19:42.528 --> 00:19:46.728
about it so you wouldn't notice.

310
00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:51.928
I was worried that Harumi would

311
00:19:51.928 --> 00:19:54.728
eventually tell all of you about it.

312
00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:59.828
I was so worried that I tried to be by her side at all times.

313
00:19:59.828 --> 00:20:04.528
But, finally, back then...

314
00:20:04.528 --> 00:20:09.228
I'm going to tell Mr. Mouri about it, after all.

315
00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:10.328
What?

316
00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:12.928
Let's pay for our crime

317
00:20:12.928 --> 00:20:15.728
and start over together.

318
00:20:15.728 --> 00:20:17.528
Hey, don't!

319
00:20:19.328 --> 00:20:21.028
Harumi!

320
00:20:23.428 --> 00:20:28.128
I pretended to look for Mr. Mouri and the others,

321
00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:30.828
then joined the president and the others.

322
00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:35.028
If it's to save yourself,

323
00:20:35.028 --> 00:20:38.828
you don't feel a thing about some innocent person being accused?

324
00:20:40.728 --> 00:20:43.128
If it's to save yourself,

325
00:20:43.128 --> 00:20:46.328
you even cold heartedly attack the one you were going to marry in spring.

326
00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:51.528
Just how selfish can you get!

327
00:20:51.528 --> 00:20:55.228
It's too much! Ms. Akiyama doesn't deserve this!

328
00:22:34.128 --> 00:22:35.828
It was feared that because of what happened,

329
00:22:35.828 --> 00:22:40.128
the mystery event would be cancelled but...

330
00:22:40.128 --> 00:22:45.128
I'll do my best to make sure it won't happen.

331
00:22:45.128 --> 00:22:46.628
Is that so?

332
00:22:46.628 --> 00:22:50.728
This is the story I'm submitting for the event.

333
00:22:50.728 --> 00:22:52.528
Let me take a look...

334
00:22:56.928 --> 00:22:59.128
Well, very interesting!

335
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.728
Just as would be expected of The Great Detective, Kogoro Mouri.

336
00:23:02.728 --> 00:23:04.128
Well, the thing is...

337
00:23:04.128 --> 00:23:06.928
When I got up in the morning, I found that by my pillow.

338
00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:09.228
-What? -Oh, nothing!

339
00:23:09.228 --> 00:23:11.028
Being as great as I am,

340
00:23:11.028 --> 00:23:12.328
writing something is so easy

341
00:23:12.328 --> 00:23:17.828
that I practically forget that I even wrote it.

342
00:23:30.528 --> 00:23:33.328
Conan, hurry up and go to sleep.

343
00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:35.328
Okay.

344
00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:39.028
That's what I want to do too.

345
00:23:39.028 --> 00:23:41.928
Huh? Conan's asleep.

346
00:23:41.928 --> 00:23:44.128
Geez.

347
00:23:44.128 --> 00:23:46.628
Brats have it so easy.

348
00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:55.228
I am Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

349
00:23:56.428 --> 00:23:57.528
You...

350
00:23:57.528 --> 00:23:58.828
What?

351
00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:01.528
You said that you'd be home late

352
00:24:01.528 --> 00:24:04.728
since you're working all day today, right?

353
00:24:04.728 --> 00:24:09.028
Let's interview the people waiting in line.

354
00:24:09.028 --> 00:24:10.528
It's them.

355
00:24:10.528 --> 00:24:12.828
They're here.

356
00:24:15.528 --> 00:24:17.128
Next Conan,

357
00:24:17.128 --> 00:24:20.928
"Happy New Year, Kogoro Mouri"

358
00:24:36.628 --> 00:24:38.728
Next Conan's hint:

359
00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:40.828
"New Year's Week".

360
00:24:40.828 --> 00:24:43.028
-This year's final "Conan" is... -The Friday Night road show!

361
00:24:43.028 --> 00:24:44.728
"The Disappearance of Edogawa Conan"

362
00:24:44.728 --> 00:24:46.028
-Me? -Me.
