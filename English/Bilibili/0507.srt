1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.940
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.140
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.140
And start the countdown to deduction and the future!

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.640
The karaoke shop that everyone goes to.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.740
What is the truth that doesn't show on the video?

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.640
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:01.795
Good morning!

10
00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:29.995
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop (Part 1)"

11
00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.895
Look at this guy, talk about stupid!

12
00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:38.595
What a laugh!

13
00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.795
He's just like you, Genta!

14
00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:46.795
The shelf over on the other side.

15
00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:48.295
You're looking for a mystery book, right?

16
00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.995
Yeah, thanks.

17
00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:00.195
Here it is, here it is! Kaori Shinmei's new mystery stories.

18
00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:01.895
"Neck Experiment at Night".

19
00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:04.895
There's only one more left. Lucky!

20
00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:10.195
Eisuke Hondo?

21
00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:13.795
Hi, Conan, long time no see.

22
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.995
Oh, it's you, Conan!

23
00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:19.495
Oh, the brats!

24
00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:20.995
So, are you guys reading comic books without buying them

25
00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.695
on your way home from school?

26
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:25.395
Yeah, they are.

27
00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:29.695
Didn't you guys come to read comic books, too?

28
00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:31.695
Wrong,

29
00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:36.695
we came to buy reference books for the upcoming test!

30
00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.295
They rushed over here to buy reference books

31
00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:40.495
because the test date is drawing near.

32
00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:43.195
Like borrowed plumes I guess.

33
00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.195
He hit the bull's eye.

34
00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:47.095
He sure knows difficult phrases.

35
00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:50.795
Eisuke, you've come back to school.

36
00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.895
I heard that you were absent for a long time.

37
00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:57.195
-Yes. -Right! He's starting school from today.

38
00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.895
You were recuperating from an illness all this time, right?

39
00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:03.195
Right, right. To cure love sickness.

40
00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:05.595
No, not love sickness, but just regular illness!

41
00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.995
Good grief.

42
00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:10.395
So he's the much rumoured about Eisuke Hondo?

43
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:11.495
Yeah.

44
00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.895
He's a high school student who came in pursuit of Rena Mizunashi,

45
00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:17.795
the announcer that resembles his older sister.

46
00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:20.495
But, Rena Mizunashi turns out to be his real older sister,

47
00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:24.295
as well as a CIA agent who snuck into...

48
00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:28.095
Right. The Black Organization,

49
00:04:28.095 --> 00:04:31.095
the guys who shrunk my body.

50
00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:33.095
Since he found out about his older sister,

51
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.895
it seems that the FBI is sheltering him.

52
00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:38.695
But judging from the fact that he's walking around freely,

53
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.695
he must've refused the witness protection program.

54
00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:46.095
"Neck Experiment at Night 1" -This is volume one of the book!

55
00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:55.395
I've got to have both volume 1 and volume 2, so I'll let you have this.

56
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:59.195
But, volume 2 of this book will be coming out next month.

57
00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.995
I can't wait that long.

58
00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:04.095
I hate to be tied down by anything.

59
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.895
And that includes time, too.

60
00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:13.795
Isn't this the reference book that the teacher recommended?

61
00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:16.795
And, it's super cheap too!

62
00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:18.895
You should buy it too, Eisuke!

63
00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:21.795
Maybe problems in this book will come out in the next exam.

64
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:23.895
You guys go ahead and buy it.

65
00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:27.695
I don't think I'll be needing it.

66
00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:30.795
That's right. Eisuke, you've already got good grades.

67
00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:33.695
Smart aleck! I'm not going to show it to you,

68
00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:36.295
even if you come crying to me begging to see it!

69
00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:44.195
See you, Conan, Ai!

70
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:45.395
See you tomorrow!

71
00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:47.195
Don't forget to do your homework!

72
00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:49.295
Same to you!

73
00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.895
50 meters behind you.

74
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:57.595
Behind the vending machine in front of the convenience store.

75
00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:00.695
We're being followed.

76
00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:04.695
Yeah, ever since we left the bookstore a while ago.

77
00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:06.695
I still don't know who they are,

78
00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:09.795
but I'm sure that they aren't from the Black Organization.

79
00:06:09.795 --> 00:06:11.795
Yes, I agree.

80
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:15.295
They would never tail anyone so conspicuously.

81
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:19.295
If so, under these circumstances, they're most likely

82
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.795
FBI agents who're watching Eisuke Hondo.

83
00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:27.795
True. If they're watching him as well as guarding him,

84
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:30.495
the distance they're maintaining is understandable.

85
00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:33.095
Well, if we want to return to our normal lifestyle,

86
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:35.995
we've got to crush them quick,

87
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.395
that crow organization.

88
00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:44.295
Oh, that's right! Since Eisuke's finally made it back to school,

89
00:06:44.295 --> 00:06:45.595
let's celebrate.

90
00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:48.195
Oh, great idea! Let's do it!

91
00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:50.795
No need to celebrate.

92
00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:55.095
Oh, what is it? You mean you can't accept our well wishes celebration?

93
00:06:55.095 --> 00:06:57.795
-That's not it. -Well, wishes celebration.

94
00:06:57.795 --> 00:07:01.395
Then, shall we go to the cake shop that opened in front of the station?

95
00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:04.095
Oh, but I don't really care for sweets.

96
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:07.695
Okay, then let's go to the hamburger shop on 4-chome.

97
00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:08.795
Let's go.

98
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.895
I hear that their spicy hot chicken is really good.

99
00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:14.595
Oh, but I don't take too well with food that's too spicy hot either.

100
00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:17.695
You sure are finicky, aren't you?

101
00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:20.795
Then, there's only one place left to go.

102
00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:24.595
A place where we can all live it up together.

103
00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:29.995
"Tears of yesterday, summer breeze sways"

104
00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:33.995
"Pulling the summer that has gone away"

105
00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.695
"I'm dreaming a dream with no continuation"

106
00:07:36.695 --> 00:07:39.395
Karaoke?

107
00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:42.595
I know that Haibara is not coming.

108
00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:46.595
"Karaoke"

109
00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:50.295
You mean the high school students

110
00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:51.695
who went in just now along with the child?

111
00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:56.295
Yeah, please inform me when they're ready to leave.

112
00:07:56.295 --> 00:08:01.295
When I came last time, I forgot something in that room.

113
00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:05.095
But, there haven't been any forgotten items recently.

114
00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:07.995
It seems that my friends hid it,

115
00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:10.495
so it can't be found that easily.

116
00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:13.495
Well, I'll be waiting while singing in another room,

117
00:08:13.495 --> 00:08:15.395
so let me know. Okay?

118
00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:19.295
"And, you will go off somewhere, too"

119
00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:23.495
"You walk off and go on your way"

120
00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:27.395
"Dreaming a dream with no continuation"

121
00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:33.495
"When you awaken, time goes by again"

122
00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:37.995
Conan, that was good!

123
00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:40.995
He's as tone-deaf as ever.

124
00:08:42.695 --> 00:08:44.395
Where's Eisuke?

125
00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:47.095
He said he had to go to the men's room a while ago.

126
00:08:47.095 --> 00:08:49.195
Oh, talk about the devil.

127
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.695
Oh, boy. The next song is the one you entered...

128
00:08:54.195 --> 00:08:55.695
What?

129
00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:56.795
What is it?

130
00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:58.695
Isn't...

131
00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:00.895
Oh, I see. This is room number 3.

132
00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:02.195
I came to the wrong room.

133
00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:04.595
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:09.995
It hurts.

135
00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:13.495
Are you all right?

136
00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:15.995
I'm sorry! I was in a rush, you see.

137
00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:18.195
Be careful.

138
00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:23.995
That klutz sure is taking his time.

139
00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:29.095
-Just for one? -Yes.

140
00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:31.895
Coming to karaoke alone after fishing.

141
00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:34.595
Unusual.

142
00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:38.495
It's the second time he's gone to the restroom.

143
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.195
What the hell is the star of the celebration doing anyway?

144
00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:43.195
Maybe he's not feeling all that well.

145
00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:45.095
After all he was sick up to now.

146
00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:46.895
I guess so.

147
00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:50.195
He's back!

148
00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.695
Are you all right? You look super pale.

149
00:09:58.695 --> 00:10:01.195
I'm just fine, yes.

150
00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:04.395
If you're not feeling well, shall we head home already?

151
00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.995
Yes, we'd better get out of here quick.

152
00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:09.595
No! Let's go home!

153
00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:16.095
-Hello? -It's 5 minutes to ending time,

154
00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:19.895
-but would you like to extend? -What? Is it time already?

155
00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:21.295
Oh, we're leaving.

156
00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:22.595
All right.

157
00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:26.695
I mean you were looking at what time it was on your cell just a while ago.

158
00:10:26.695 --> 00:10:29.295
Conan, make sure not forget anything.

159
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.295
Okay.

160
00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:33.795
Well, the only thing I have on me is my school bag.

161
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.095
What happened?

162
00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:40.895
My goodness.

163
00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:42.495
Is this for real?

164
00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:55.395
Call the police and ambulance.

165
00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:56.995
Right away!

166
00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:02.795
What was that voice all about?

167
00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:06.795
Is anything wrong?

168
00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:10.295
Hello, police?

169
00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.195
The police?

170
00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:18.795
No good, he's not breathing anymore.

171
00:11:18.795 --> 00:11:21.395
He probably died during the last 30 minutes.

172
00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:25.295
Yes. The Karaoke shop in 3-chome!

173
00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:29.195
A customer is lying on the ground and...

174
00:11:29.195 --> 00:11:32.295
This room is around the corner up ahead.

175
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:35.495
It's located at a blind spot from the cashier.

176
00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.195
Up ahead around the corner

177
00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:40.895
are the men's room and a cigarette vending machine.

178
00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:46.195
Come to think of it, he went to the men's room.

179
00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:55.095
It's him after all.

180
00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:58.095
He's the man that was tailing us a while ago.

181
00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:02.995
If this man really is a FBI agent...

182
00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:06.295
I hate to be tied down by anything.

183
00:12:06.295 --> 00:12:07.295
Don't tell me that...

184
00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:11.295
I don't think I'll need it.

185
00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:13.695
I hope not...

186
00:12:22.895 --> 00:12:25.595
Don't tell me that it's him...

187
00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.806
According to the driver's license that the victim had on him,

188
00:12:47.806 --> 00:12:51.806
he is Mr. Tatsumi Moniwa, age 46.

189
00:12:51.806 --> 00:12:53.006
Officer Tome.

190
00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:58.006
He's been hit on the head repeatedly with a blunt object.

191
00:12:58.006 --> 00:12:59.806
He's been beaten to death.

192
00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:03.106
Which means that the suit top...

193
00:13:03.106 --> 00:13:07.706
The killer probably put it over him to avoid being splattered with blood.

194
00:13:07.706 --> 00:13:10.506
The other things that were left at the scene are...

195
00:13:12.106 --> 00:13:13.406
Inspector!

196
00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:16.206
This was found in the chest pocket of the victim's suit top.

197
00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:20.506
This is a compact camera.

198
00:13:20.506 --> 00:13:22.106
What on earth did he take pictures of?

199
00:13:22.106 --> 00:13:25.606
We've got to develop the film to find out.

200
00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:27.106
Officer Chiba!

201
00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.306
Yes, sir!

202
00:13:30.506 --> 00:13:33.906
Develop this film immediately, will you.

203
00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:36.406
I got it.

204
00:13:36.406 --> 00:13:38.806
You're the one who is in charge of the reception desk

205
00:13:38.806 --> 00:13:43.206
at this karaoke box. And you discovered the body, right?

206
00:13:43.206 --> 00:13:44.406
Yes.

207
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:48.006
Did the victim have someone else with him when he came here?

208
00:13:48.006 --> 00:13:50.906
No. He came alone

209
00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:53.906
but he made a queer request at that time.

210
00:13:53.906 --> 00:13:55.906
A queer request?

211
00:13:55.906 --> 00:13:58.106
He asked me to let him know

212
00:13:58.106 --> 00:14:01.306
when the high school students with the child are ready to leave.

213
00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:03.106
-What? -What?

214
00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:06.806
When Ran and the others leave the room?

215
00:14:06.806 --> 00:14:08.406
Why did he ask that?

216
00:14:08.406 --> 00:14:10.706
He said he forgot something

217
00:14:10.706 --> 00:14:13.206
in the room that they were using when he came here,

218
00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:16.106
so that he wanted to search the room after they left.

219
00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:18.906
What was the thing he forgot?

220
00:14:18.906 --> 00:14:22.406
I don't know. When I came to let him know that they were leaving,

221
00:14:22.406 --> 00:14:24.806
I found him like this.

222
00:14:24.806 --> 00:14:27.906
No, he wasn't looking for something he forgot.

223
00:14:27.906 --> 00:14:30.206
He was planning on tailing us again

224
00:14:30.206 --> 00:14:32.706
once we left the karaoke shop

225
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.406
like he was doing before we came here.

226
00:14:37.506 --> 00:14:41.006
The reason he could've been tailing us

227
00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:44.606
was to watch and protect a certain person.

228
00:14:44.606 --> 00:14:48.506
Right. If this man is a FBI agent,

229
00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:51.506
and if his mission was to do so...

230
00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:54.006
The most suspicious person

231
00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:58.806
would be the person this man was suspected to have been tailing.

232
00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:01.906
And that's Eisuke Hondo.

233
00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:04.506
He doesn't like being tied down.

234
00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:06.406
More than anything, he's been acting strange

235
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.406
since coming back from the men's room.

236
00:15:09.406 --> 00:15:12.406
Well, it's also thinkable that he witnessed something

237
00:15:12.406 --> 00:15:16.006
involved with the incident too, but...

238
00:15:16.006 --> 00:15:19.406
And after the victim went into this room,

239
00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:23.006
how many customers left this shop?

240
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:25.006
I don't think anyone did.

241
00:15:25.006 --> 00:15:28.206
There were several customers that came, though.

242
00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:31.806
First, those high school students with the child came

243
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.706
and went into room number 3.

244
00:15:33.706 --> 00:15:36.306
Right after them, the customer who died came

245
00:15:36.306 --> 00:15:38.306
and went into room number 5.

246
00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:41.306
And after that, if I remember correctly...

247
00:15:41.306 --> 00:15:45.106
Dark coloured man entered room number 4.

248
00:15:45.106 --> 00:15:48.106
A customer with a long face went into room number 2.

249
00:15:48.106 --> 00:15:49.606
And an elderly customer

250
00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:52.706
went into room number 1, in that order, I think.

251
00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:56.306
Which means that the killer daringly stayed here

252
00:15:56.306 --> 00:15:59.606
even after committing the murder?

253
00:15:59.606 --> 00:16:01.706
-What? -Don't tell me that you guys...

254
00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:03.806
Are you suspecting us?

255
00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:05.906
Oh, no. Well, pardon me.

256
00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:07.706
But, just in case,

257
00:16:07.706 --> 00:16:09.706
can you all please give me your names?

258
00:16:09.706 --> 00:16:14.106
"Kyota Honma (32), Customer Room 2" -Oh, I'm Kyota Honma.

259
00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:17.906
"Konji Arimoto (34), Customer Room 4" -My name's Konji Arimoto.

260
00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:22.206
"Kunio Tamai (63), Customer Room 1" -I'm Kunio Tamai.

261
00:16:22.206 --> 00:16:27.206
In other words, to sum it up this is what happened.

262
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:33.006
Please wait!

263
00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:36.406
You mentioned a dark coloured customer just a while ago, didn't you?

264
00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:41.106
Yes. And that customer had someone with him.

265
00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:43.206
Yes, I am.

266
00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:48.306
But, that person lying down on the sofa in my room right now.

267
00:16:52.606 --> 00:16:55.806
Hey, hey, don't get up yet!

268
00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.506
Yeah, sorry.

269
00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:01.606
His voice is hoarse.

270
00:17:01.606 --> 00:17:04.806
Yeah, it's been trashed from singing too much while having a cold,

271
00:17:04.806 --> 00:17:07.506
so now the hoarse voice.

272
00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:10.106
But, this one was in this room all this time,

273
00:17:10.106 --> 00:17:11.806
so this one has nothing to do with the incident.

274
00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:15.006
But, he's got to have something to prove it.

275
00:17:15.006 --> 00:17:16.806
Proof?

276
00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:18.806
Are you all right, Eisuke?

277
00:17:18.806 --> 00:17:20.506
You look pale again.

278
00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:21.906
I'm fine.

279
00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:26.506
Hey, don't tell me that you're the one who did it?

280
00:17:26.506 --> 00:17:29.406
I didn't do it, I just saw!

281
00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:31.006
Saw what?

282
00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:33.206
When I came back from the men's room the second time,

283
00:17:33.206 --> 00:17:35.006
I went into the wrong room.

284
00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:39.806
I went into the room of that dark-skinned man.

285
00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:42.806
Then...

286
00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:43.906
Then what happened?

287
00:17:43.906 --> 00:17:48.206
He and that person was...

288
00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:50.906
was kissing!

289
00:17:50.906 --> 00:17:52.206
-What? -What?

290
00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:56.906
I guess that was too much stimulation for a kid.

291
00:17:56.906 --> 00:18:00.606
Well, no. I don't think the issue is that he was a kid...

292
00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:03.106
You mean kissing in a karaoke shop is not allowed?

293
00:18:03.106 --> 00:18:04.206
No, that's not what I mean.

294
00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:06.006
It'd be no big deal if you're a normal couple.

295
00:18:06.006 --> 00:18:09.506
But, I think it's natural that he'd be surprised to see two men doing so.

296
00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:13.806
-What did you said? -I understand.

297
00:18:17.006 --> 00:18:18.406
How rude!

298
00:18:18.406 --> 00:18:20.606
I'm a woman!

299
00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:24.106
-What? -What?

300
00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:27.706
A woman?

301
00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.606
Oh, I see.

302
00:18:30.606 --> 00:18:32.406
Oh, my apologies.

303
00:18:32.406 --> 00:18:35.106
Well, she body builds too,

304
00:18:35.106 --> 00:18:37.706
so it's no surprise you made a mistake.

305
00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:41.006
Oh, so that's what it was...

306
00:18:41.006 --> 00:18:45.006
But, I'm glad. You were acting strange,

307
00:18:45.006 --> 00:18:48.106
so I was worried.

308
00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:51.906
I'm really glad.

309
00:18:51.906 --> 00:18:55.806
Yes, I'm glad.

310
00:18:55.806 --> 00:18:59.206
It's not that all suspicion on you has cleared yet.

311
00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:01.606
Would you like to take a look at the images

312
00:19:01.606 --> 00:19:03.906
on the surveillance camera of the reception desk?

313
00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:06.406
The room of the person who died isn't monitored,

314
00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:10.806
but you can see who left their room and when they leave.

315
00:19:16.206 --> 00:19:18.006
Someone's come out.

316
00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:21.006
First, it's Mr. Honma of room 2.

317
00:19:23.706 --> 00:19:26.006
You disappeared after going into the direction

318
00:19:26.006 --> 00:19:28.006
of the victim's room.

319
00:19:28.006 --> 00:19:29.506
I went to the men's room!

320
00:19:29.506 --> 00:19:32.806
You saw it, didn't you? That the men's room is in that direction.

321
00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:36.306
Next, it's Eisuke.

322
00:19:36.306 --> 00:19:38.906
I also went to the men's room.

323
00:19:38.906 --> 00:19:42.506
Mr. Honma just came out of the men's room.

324
00:19:42.506 --> 00:19:44.706
Yes, right. I am.

325
00:19:44.706 --> 00:19:47.406
Oh, he's back.

326
00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:53.106
After that it was Mr. Arimoto from room number 4.

327
00:19:53.106 --> 00:19:56.906
Yeah, I went to the restroom too.

328
00:19:56.906 --> 00:20:00.206
Next is Mr. Tamai of room number 1.

329
00:20:00.206 --> 00:20:02.106
Did you also go to the restroom?

330
00:20:02.106 --> 00:20:04.806
No, I went to buy some cigarettes,

331
00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:06.706
but the brand I wanted was sold out,

332
00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.206
and I couldn't decide what other brand to get,

333
00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:10.506
so I returned without buying anything.

334
00:20:10.506 --> 00:20:14.806
It's true he came back in about two minutes.

335
00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:18.206
Oh, Mr. Arimoto's back, too.

336
00:20:18.206 --> 00:20:20.706
Eisuke hasn't come back yet.

337
00:20:20.706 --> 00:20:22.406
Right.

338
00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:24.606
Let's fast forward the monitor a little.

339
00:20:28.606 --> 00:20:31.206
Oh, he's come back.

340
00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:40.206
Just as he said,

341
00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:43.706
it seems he made a mistake and went into room number 4.

342
00:20:43.706 --> 00:20:45.106
Yes.

343
00:20:45.106 --> 00:20:48.206
After Eisuke returns to room number 3,

344
00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.406
you're also on the camera.

345
00:20:50.406 --> 00:20:52.806
I told you just a while ago, didn't I?

346
00:20:52.806 --> 00:20:54.006
That I went to tell the man who died

347
00:20:54.006 --> 00:20:57.406
that the high school students were leaving.

348
00:20:57.406 --> 00:20:59.206
But it could also be that you made everyone think so

349
00:20:59.206 --> 00:21:00.706
and actually went to kill him.

350
00:21:00.706 --> 00:21:02.706
I don't think so!

351
00:21:02.706 --> 00:21:06.906
I heard that person scream and went right away,

352
00:21:06.906 --> 00:21:08.306
but the blood of the person

353
00:21:08.306 --> 00:21:09.906
who was lying on the ground was practically dried.

354
00:21:09.906 --> 00:21:12.306
Really?

355
00:21:12.306 --> 00:21:13.806
What he said is true.

356
00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:18.106
Conan comes dashing out of the room in less than a minute

357
00:21:18.106 --> 00:21:20.906
after the staff heads for the victim's room.

358
00:21:20.906 --> 00:21:23.406
Which means, the suspects are

359
00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:27.606
Eisuke and all you three.

360
00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:34.306
Okay, everyone, we're going to question each of you one by one,

361
00:21:34.306 --> 00:21:36.806
so please wait in front of your rooms.

362
00:21:36.806 --> 00:21:38.906
We want to look for something, too.

363
00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:42.306
Look for something?

364
00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:44.406
The murder weapon.

365
00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:46.506
The blunt object that was used

366
00:21:46.506 --> 00:21:50.806
to kill Mr. Moniwa is nowhere in sight.

367
00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:54.706
Right. The suspects are the four people who's entering

368
00:21:54.706 --> 00:21:58.206
and leaving each of their rooms are recorded by the surveillance camera.

369
00:21:58.206 --> 00:22:00.806
Mr. Tamai in room number 1,

370
00:22:00.806 --> 00:22:03.306
Mr. Honma in room number 2,

371
00:22:03.306 --> 00:22:05.806
Mr. Arimoto in room number 4,

372
00:22:05.806 --> 00:22:07.906
and...

373
00:22:07.906 --> 00:22:09.206
Eisuke.

374
00:22:10.206 --> 00:22:15.606
The victim was killed by being beaten on the head with a blunt object.

375
00:22:15.606 --> 00:22:19.006
But no such thing was found at the scene of the crime.

376
00:22:19.006 --> 00:22:22.006
Did the killer have the murder weapon?

377
00:22:22.006 --> 00:22:25.406
It's a fact that Mr. Moniwa was tailing us.

378
00:22:25.406 --> 00:22:30.306
If he was a FBI agent who was watching and guarding Eisuke,

379
00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:33.406
did Eisuke who didn't like it...

380
00:22:33.406 --> 00:22:38.606
No, is he really a FBI agent to begin with?

381
00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:42.506
Who on earth could've killed Mr. Moniwa?

382
00:24:09.806 --> 00:24:12.506
"Next Episode" -Hey, what's this?

383
00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:14.906
It's the picture of us! Gross.

384
00:24:14.906 --> 00:24:17.406
The murder weapons nowhere in sight.

385
00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:22.506
I'm sure it's somewhere in this karaoke shop.

386
00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:26.206
Isn't that boy wearing the round glasses the culprit?

387
00:24:26.206 --> 00:24:27.406
No.

388
00:24:27.406 --> 00:24:30.406
I know the murder weapon is here.

389
00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:31.506
What?

390
00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:34.306
Sonoko! Your usual "thing" has come!

391
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.806
Next Conan,

392
00:24:35.806 --> 00:24:39.706
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop (Part 2)"

393
00:24:55.306 --> 00:24:57.606
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:57.606 --> 00:25:00.006
"Shoes of the Suspects"

395
00:25:00.006 --> 00:25:01.706
That hint is just like Cinderella.

396
00:25:01.706 --> 00:25:03.606
Just like Cinderella.

397
00:25:03.606 --> 00:25:04.806
Yeah.
