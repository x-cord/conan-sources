1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.370
The day after we returned from Kyoto,

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.470
Maria Higashio missed class at Teitan Elementary School

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.470
without any notice.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.270
Now that you mention it,

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.770
she said she found a letter from her dead grandma

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.170
in her desk drawer the other day.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.970
It sounds like Grandma

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.770
set up a treasure hunt in her house for me.

9
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.770
Do you guys want to invite Conan

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.870
and look for it together sometime?

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.870
Sure, let's do it.

12
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.770
Believing Maria went to her dead grandmother's house

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.270
"Higashio" -to look for treasure,

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.770
they visited her grandmother's home,

15
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.270
"Start! Maria, good luck!" -where they found a mysterious message.

16
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.870
Meanwhile...

17
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.870
Hello?

18
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.670
I told you not to draw attention to yourself!

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970
Everyone's talking about you online!

20
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.070
What?

21
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.570
"High school detective Shinichi Kudo solves the case!"

22
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.470
"The rumors that he's dead were wrong!"

23
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070
They're talking about me online?

24
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
This isn't good! The news has spread everywhere!

25
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.370
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

26
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.370
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

27
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.870
How will we combat the news spreading online?

28
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.870
The boss of the Organization is revealed!

29
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.470
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.570
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:19.727
"Find Maria (Part 2)"

33
00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:26.027
Hey, Ran!

34
00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:29.027
Look out the window.

35
00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:30.627
Out the window?

36
00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:34.627
Don't you think that's a huge group of reporters?

37
00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:37.527
Yeah. Did something happen?

38
00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:39.427
Something sure did happen.

39
00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:44.927
Everyone's talking about your boyfriend online right now.

40
00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:47.727
What? Why are they talking about Shinichi?

41
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.227
Oh, my. You just casually acknowledged

42
00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:54.827
that Shinichi is your boyfriend, madam.

43
00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:58.027
Why shouldn't I? He is my boyfriend.

44
00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:00.927
Hey, take your seats.

45
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:02.627
Let's get started.

46
00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:12.427
This room seems to be directly beneath that arrow.

47
00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:17.927
What a cute room.

48
00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:22.827
Maria must have stayed in this room

49
00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:25.227
when she came to this house.

50
00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:28.827
Isn't it kind of cold in here?

51
00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:31.627
Well, we are in the basement.

52
00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:33.827
So, where's the next arrow?

53
00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:36.327
I don't see an arrow,

54
00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:40.227
but there's a note stuck to the bedside table next to the bed.

55
00:04:40.227 --> 00:04:41.227
What?

56
00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:43.027
What does it say?

57
00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:46.327
"Now you can use the bathroom during the night!"

58
00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.327
During the night?

59
00:04:48.327 --> 00:04:53.227
She must've meant to turn on this light before going to bed, so...

60
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:56.727
Could you turn out the lights?

61
00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:58.027
Okay!

62
00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:01.927
This is...

63
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.427
Wow!

64
00:05:03.427 --> 00:05:06.227
The bumpy pattern goes all around the room.

65
00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:09.327
But it doesn't look like an arrow.

66
00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:11.827
No.

67
00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:13.627
Something was left here.

68
00:05:14.827 --> 00:05:17.727
These two rectangular marks

69
00:05:17.727 --> 00:05:19.827
must've been left by this photo frame.

70
00:05:21.727 --> 00:05:24.727
The shadow changed for some reason.

71
00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:25.927
That's it.

72
00:05:25.927 --> 00:05:30.227
Which means, if we place something in the other rectangular marks...

73
00:05:32.627 --> 00:05:35.027
It must be this doll.

74
00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:39.627
If you match the doll's base to this square mark...

75
00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:42.727
It changed again!

76
00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:44.927
Is there anything on the floor over there?

77
00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.327
Huh?

78
00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:53.427
Not on the floor, but this sailboat on the shelf fell over.

79
00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:56.327
Could you try standing it back up?

80
00:05:56.327 --> 00:05:57.327
Sure.

81
00:05:57.327 --> 00:06:00.027
Try to keep it in the same place.

82
00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:01.227
It's up.

83
00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.227
Now, move out of the way.

84
00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:04.627
Okay.

85
00:06:06.327 --> 00:06:09.027
-Amazing! -There's an arrow on the wall!

86
00:06:09.027 --> 00:06:10.627
That's it!

87
00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:16.827
Then the next one must be in the room next door.

88
00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:21.527
Huh?

89
00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:23.027
It's a bathroom.

90
00:06:23.027 --> 00:06:25.227
Indeed.

91
00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:29.227
But there's very obviously an arrow in here.

92
00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:33.627
But the only thing it's pointing towards is the bath.

93
00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:37.427
That's not a bath, it's a shower.

94
00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:41.127
There's a note in front of the arrow on the sink.

95
00:06:42.127 --> 00:06:45.827
"Take care of my bird!"

96
00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:49.027
What bird?

97
00:06:49.027 --> 00:06:51.327
Does she mean this doll?

98
00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.927
It seems to have a beak.

99
00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:57.627
But how do we take care of it?

100
00:06:57.627 --> 00:06:59.827
What a strange doll.

101
00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:02.027
I don't recognize it.

102
00:07:02.027 --> 00:07:06.727
I feel like I've seen this before.

103
00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.127
Now that we're stuck...

104
00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.127
That means...

105
00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.927
-We'll have to ask. -Huh?

106
00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:13.827
Ask Conan!

107
00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:18.027
Can't we?

108
00:07:18.027 --> 00:07:19.627
Why not?

109
00:07:19.627 --> 00:07:22.127
I'm sure he knows what it is.

110
00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:26.227
Conan's over his cold, right?

111
00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:28.527
Then let's try calling him.

112
00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:32.127
Don't we need to find Maria as soon as possible?

113
00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:41.327
I hate to ask that promise-breaker for help,

114
00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.427
but we don't have a choice.

115
00:07:45.827 --> 00:07:47.427
I know!

116
00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:50.827
Shinichi Kudo had a twin brother,

117
00:07:50.827 --> 00:07:53.227
and it was his brother who died.

118
00:07:53.227 --> 00:07:56.727
Why don't we spread that rumor online?

119
00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:59.527
People would know immediately that that's a lie!

120
00:07:59.527 --> 00:08:01.827
Don't you get it, Shinichi?

121
00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:06.227
If the Black Organization finds out that you're alive...

122
00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:09.627
Yeah, I know.

123
00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:14.327
I'm so worried that if I don't joke about it,

124
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.027
I'll go crazy.

125
00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:19.027
Gosh.

126
00:08:22.427 --> 00:08:23.827
"Incoming Call, Ai Haibara" -Haibara.

127
00:08:24.927 --> 00:08:27.927
Well? Did you come up with a plan?

128
00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:34.327
What? You still haven't found Maria?

129
00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:37.427
But it's already evening.

130
00:08:39.827 --> 00:08:41.427
I see.

131
00:08:41.427 --> 00:08:45.827
Maria seems to have stopped by her grandmother's house before school

132
00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:49.127
in order to look for the treasure she hid,

133
00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:50.727
but you couldn't find her.

134
00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:55.527
You followed the notes and arrows left by her grandmother

135
00:08:55.527 --> 00:08:58.427
and arrived at the bathroom,

136
00:08:58.427 --> 00:09:03.227
but the arrow pointed to an empty shower room.

137
00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:05.527
That's right.

138
00:09:05.527 --> 00:09:07.027
Hey.

139
00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:09.027
You just laughed, didn't you?

140
00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:13.727
If you've figured out the answer, tell me, you traitor.

141
00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:16.227
Traitor?

142
00:09:16.227 --> 00:09:18.127
Conan, please!

143
00:09:18.127 --> 00:09:21.427
If we don't find her soon, then Maria...

144
00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:26.427
You guys aren't taking care of the drinking bird.

145
00:09:26.427 --> 00:09:28.527
Drinking bird?

146
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:31.427
Drinking bird? You mean...

147
00:09:31.427 --> 00:09:35.527
this bird-like doll to the right of the arrow?

148
00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:36.727
Yeah.

149
00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:42.027
Drinking birds use the slight heat generated by evaporation to...

150
00:09:42.027 --> 00:09:46.327
In any case, the bird will move if you give it water.

151
00:09:46.327 --> 00:09:49.527
How are we supposed to give it water?

152
00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:53.127
There's a glass cup with a toothbrush on the sink.

153
00:09:53.127 --> 00:09:56.427
Pour water in that and place it in front of the doll.

154
00:09:56.427 --> 00:09:57.727
Okay!

155
00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:02.927
I did it.

156
00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:08.527
It's not moving.

157
00:10:08.527 --> 00:10:10.427
Maybe it's broken.

158
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:13.427
Place the doll's beak inside the cup.

159
00:10:14.427 --> 00:10:15.427
Like this?

160
00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:17.527
That's it.

161
00:10:17.527 --> 00:10:21.127
Now let go, and it should stand up on its own.

162
00:10:21.127 --> 00:10:25.727
After some time, it'll dip its beak in the water again.

163
00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:30.927
-Why? -It's amazing!

164
00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:33.527
It's like it's actually drinking water.

165
00:10:33.527 --> 00:10:35.227
Wow!

166
00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:43.327
I see.

167
00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:46.227
This is how it's using the vaporization heat.

168
00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:51.127
So? What does this accomplish?

169
00:10:51.127 --> 00:10:54.627
Look at the arrow through the cup.

170
00:10:54.627 --> 00:10:56.827
Through the cup?

171
00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:02.127
The arrow's pointing the other way!

172
00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:03.927
Why?

173
00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:08.127
The water in the cup is refracting the light,

174
00:11:08.127 --> 00:11:10.827
changing the focal point because of something called Snell's law.

175
00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:13.327
It makes objects appear flipped.

176
00:11:13.327 --> 00:11:16.527
In other words, the arrow is pointing

177
00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:19.627
not towards the shower room in the bathroom,

178
00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:23.827
but that room across from the bathroom.

179
00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:25.827
Let's check it out!

180
00:11:25.827 --> 00:11:27.427
Yes.

181
00:11:27.427 --> 00:11:29.927
Maybe Maria's asleep.

182
00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:34.427
Call Ms. Kobayashi once you find Maria.

183
00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.527
I know.

184
00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:37.827
Later.

185
00:11:40.227 --> 00:11:43.027
Who is it? Delivery?

186
00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:48.027
Huh? Sushi?

187
00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:51.027
-Hello. -But I haven't ordered anything.

188
00:11:51.027 --> 00:11:55.327
Nah. I came to make a delivery in this neighborhood,

189
00:11:55.327 --> 00:12:00.827
but I can't get through because of the commotion next door.

190
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:04.827
I thought the neighbors might know what's up,

191
00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:06.327
so I stopped by.

192
00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:09.827
Sorry, I wouldn't know.

193
00:12:09.827 --> 00:12:14.327
That guy works at Irohazushi next to the detective agency.

194
00:12:14.327 --> 00:12:18.827
I think his name is Kanenori Wakita.

195
00:12:33.527 --> 00:12:35.127
No way.

196
00:12:39.327 --> 00:12:41.427
It's really them.

197
00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:50.427
Nice to meet you. I'm Yusaku Kudo.

198
00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:53.127
And I'm Yukiko.

199
00:13:02.894 --> 00:13:05.694
What? The door won't open?

200
00:13:05.694 --> 00:13:10.094
No. It's the door the arrow in the bathroom was pointing to.

201
00:13:10.094 --> 00:13:12.894
What kind of door is it?

202
00:13:12.894 --> 00:13:14.594
What kind?

203
00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:16.794
It looks like it opens inward.

204
00:13:16.794 --> 00:13:19.194
There are lots of flowers carved into it.

205
00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:21.394
These look hand-made.

206
00:13:21.394 --> 00:13:24.194
Maria mentioned that

207
00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:28.594
her grandpa was a really good hobbyist carpenter.

208
00:13:28.594 --> 00:13:33.694
He could make anything, like shelves and desks and chairs.

209
00:13:33.694 --> 00:13:38.794
Then maybe her grandfather made this door, too.

210
00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:45.594
Yeah, but her grandpa passed away before her grandma.

211
00:13:45.594 --> 00:13:48.094
Does that door have a trick?

212
00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:49.594
A trick?

213
00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:51.694
Does it make any noise

214
00:13:51.694 --> 00:13:53.394
when you push or pull on the knob?

215
00:13:55.194 --> 00:13:58.494
It won't budge an inch whether you push or pull.

216
00:13:58.494 --> 00:14:00.994
In other words, there's no tri...

217
00:14:03.194 --> 00:14:04.994
Did someone sneeze?

218
00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:07.194
It's cold here in the basement.

219
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:08.694
I see.

220
00:14:08.694 --> 00:14:11.494
The door won't open because

221
00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:13.794
the room on the other side of the door

222
00:14:13.794 --> 00:14:17.694
is warmer than the hallway you're in.

223
00:14:17.694 --> 00:14:21.994
The air pressure is keeping the door shut from the inside.

224
00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:26.894
Normally, carpenters build a gap so that doesn't happen,

225
00:14:26.894 --> 00:14:30.194
but her grandfather must not have known to do that.

226
00:14:30.194 --> 00:14:32.194
So? What do we do?

227
00:14:32.194 --> 00:14:35.594
Since the door was left as is,

228
00:14:35.594 --> 00:14:40.094
there's probably enough space for an adult to open it.

229
00:14:40.794 --> 00:14:44.794
If you all push with the knob turned, it should open.

230
00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:53.894
Maria!

231
00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:55.794
Maria!

232
00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:59.094
Ai?

233
00:14:59.094 --> 00:15:01.894
How is she?

234
00:15:01.894 --> 00:15:04.994
It's okay. She's just asleep.

235
00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:09.294
Wow!

236
00:15:09.294 --> 00:15:14.894
The room is covered with Maria and her grandparents.

237
00:15:14.894 --> 00:15:18.194
That's a lot of home movies.

238
00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:19.694
I see.

239
00:15:19.694 --> 00:15:23.694
This room full of their memories is their treasure.

240
00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:29.094
Is she awake?

241
00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:33.894
Huh? Guys? What's going on?

242
00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:36.594
You missed school.

243
00:15:36.594 --> 00:15:38.894
We were worried, so we came here.

244
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:41.194
Huh? School?

245
00:15:41.194 --> 00:15:42.694
Oh, right!

246
00:15:42.694 --> 00:15:46.694
I was going to go to school after watching this video,

247
00:15:46.694 --> 00:15:50.294
but I couldn't open the door.

248
00:15:50.294 --> 00:15:55.394
I thought I had to finish watching to open the door,

249
00:15:55.394 --> 00:15:57.594
but I started getting sleepy.

250
00:15:59.194 --> 00:16:02.494
I fell asleep, and now I'm hungry.

251
00:16:14.094 --> 00:16:15.894
Come on, Hattori!

252
00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:20.394
Tell us something about Kudo.

253
00:16:20.394 --> 00:16:22.794
I already told you,

254
00:16:22.794 --> 00:16:27.094
that guy next to me on the news wasn't Kudo!

255
00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:30.394
That's impossible! No matter how you look at it...

256
00:16:30.394 --> 00:16:33.694
I'm not surprised you thought it was him.

257
00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:36.494
That was Kyoto Senshin second-year

258
00:16:36.494 --> 00:16:40.794
and Kudo lookalike Soshi Okita the kendo brat.

259
00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:44.594
What?

260
00:16:46.194 --> 00:16:47.294
Huh?

261
00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:50.994
The crowd of reporters at the gates has shrunk.

262
00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:52.494
You're right.

263
00:16:52.494 --> 00:16:53.794
I wonder what happened.

264
00:16:53.794 --> 00:16:56.694
-This is probably why. -What?

265
00:16:56.694 --> 00:17:01.094
The person who said they saw your boyfriend at Kiyomizu Temple

266
00:17:01.094 --> 00:17:04.194
says they might've been hallucinating.

267
00:17:04.194 --> 00:17:06.094
Hallucinating?

268
00:17:06.094 --> 00:17:08.894
But Shinichi was at Kiyomizu Temple.

269
00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:12.994
Hattori's saying the boy seen on TV in Ponto City

270
00:17:12.994 --> 00:17:15.994
was Okita.

271
00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:21.794
Looks like everyone's agreeing your boyfriend wasn't there.

272
00:17:23.194 --> 00:17:28.694
Our teacher did just tell us not to respond to reporters

273
00:17:28.694 --> 00:17:30.794
if they asked us about Shinichi.

274
00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:35.094
Makes you wonder if what we saw was an illusion, too.

275
00:17:36.094 --> 00:17:37.894
An illusion?

276
00:17:37.894 --> 00:17:39.494
That wasn't an illusion.

277
00:17:40.694 --> 00:17:43.194
Shinichi really was there.

278
00:17:43.194 --> 00:17:46.294
Of course we're dating.

279
00:17:47.294 --> 00:17:49.394
See?

280
00:17:49.394 --> 00:17:55.194
I'm the one who said she saw Shinichi Kudo at Kiyomizu Temple.

281
00:17:55.194 --> 00:17:58.494
But now that I think about it,

282
00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.094
I think that was a hallucination produced by my own desires.

283
00:18:01.094 --> 00:18:04.094
I'm sorry for the commotion I caused.

284
00:18:06.194 --> 00:18:08.194
"Mouri Detective Agency"

285
00:18:09.094 --> 00:18:11.294
Thank you.

286
00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:15.494
By the way, do you have any plans for Christmas, Amuro?

287
00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.394
None in particular.

288
00:18:17.394 --> 00:18:19.094
I see.

289
00:18:19.094 --> 00:18:20.094
What is it?

290
00:18:20.094 --> 00:18:22.694
The manager wants to plan our shift schedule for December,

291
00:18:22.694 --> 00:18:24.194
so he wanted me to ask you.

292
00:18:25.694 --> 00:18:26.994
A message?

293
00:18:29.894 --> 00:18:33.194
Seeking information on Shinichi Kudo.

294
00:18:33.194 --> 00:18:34.994
Time is money!

295
00:18:34.994 --> 00:18:37.394
Hurry, Bourbon.

296
00:18:37.394 --> 00:18:39.594
Rum.

297
00:18:39.594 --> 00:18:41.394
Roger that.

298
00:18:41.394 --> 00:18:42.894
"Send"

299
00:20:08.394 --> 00:20:12.294
That giant crowd of reporters is gone.

300
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.994
I'm not sure why, though.

301
00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:19.494
Probably because the world's biggest Kudo family fan,

302
00:20:19.494 --> 00:20:24.694
who caused the commotion, calmed their excitement by posting that

303
00:20:24.694 --> 00:20:29.094
the Shinichi Kudo she saw at Kiyomizu Temple was an illusion.

304
00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:30.494
But why did she suddenly post that?

305
00:20:30.494 --> 00:20:35.594
Because we used her fanaticism against her.

306
00:20:35.594 --> 00:20:37.194
Shin!

307
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.394
Dad and Mom?

308
00:20:40.294 --> 00:20:41.894
What?

309
00:20:41.894 --> 00:20:44.894
You bribed her with your autographs?

310
00:20:44.894 --> 00:20:49.894
Yeah. As our fan, we knew she'd accept our terms.

311
00:20:49.894 --> 00:20:52.694
We even told her why.

312
00:20:52.694 --> 00:20:55.294
"Our son is still young."

313
00:20:55.294 --> 00:20:59.394
"We don't want this case to go to his head."

314
00:20:59.394 --> 00:21:04.694
"Could you pretend the incident at Kiyomizu Temple didn't happen?"

315
00:21:05.694 --> 00:21:08.794
I'm surprised you were able to meet with the owner of the blog.

316
00:21:08.794 --> 00:21:11.894
We sent a message to the administrator of the blog.

317
00:21:11.894 --> 00:21:15.694
"This is Yukiko Kudo, avid reader of your blog."

318
00:21:15.694 --> 00:21:17.294
"There's something I'd like to discuss with you,

319
00:21:17.294 --> 00:21:21.694
so could you meet me and my husband at the airport?"

320
00:21:21.694 --> 00:21:26.494
"Please let us know once you've confirmed it's actually us."

321
00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.094
I see.

322
00:21:28.094 --> 00:21:32.094
We also reached out to the school to give them a heads-up,

323
00:21:32.094 --> 00:21:34.994
so that should be the end of the Shinichi Kudo disturbance.

324
00:21:36.694 --> 00:21:38.694
Officially, that is.

325
00:21:40.794 --> 00:21:45.394
It's extremely likely your so-called Black Organization

326
00:21:45.394 --> 00:21:47.894
has zeroed in on this.

327
00:21:47.894 --> 00:21:52.794
Gosh. It's your fault for going wild on your school trip.

328
00:21:52.794 --> 00:21:54.594
I couldn't help it.

329
00:21:54.594 --> 00:21:57.894
I got caught up in the case.

330
00:21:57.894 --> 00:21:59.694
Well, sounds like

331
00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:02.294
something happened between you and Ran because of it.

332
00:22:05.094 --> 00:22:06.994
How do you know that?

333
00:22:06.994 --> 00:22:10.694
The administrator of the blog said

334
00:22:10.694 --> 00:22:13.294
she saw you kissing at the Kiyomizu butai.

335
00:22:14.394 --> 00:22:16.894
Also...

336
00:22:16.894 --> 00:22:21.794
the code left at the scene of Koji Haneda's murder...

337
00:22:22.594 --> 00:22:24.794
ASACA and RUM.

338
00:22:24.794 --> 00:22:26.394
About that...

339
00:22:26.394 --> 00:22:30.594
I discussed it with the FBI agent living in our house.

340
00:22:30.594 --> 00:22:32.194
He concluded that the code

341
00:22:32.194 --> 00:22:35.194
isn't meant to be split into ASACA and RUM,

342
00:22:35.194 --> 00:22:40.694
but instead should be read as a single name containing all eight letters.

343
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:42.394
A single name?

344
00:22:43.394 --> 00:22:45.894
Not split into two?

345
00:22:48.194 --> 00:22:51.794
Eight letters, one name...

346
00:22:51.794 --> 00:22:55.394
As a low-ranking member, the only thing I know is

347
00:22:55.394 --> 00:22:58.694
that the organization's color is black.

348
00:22:58.694 --> 00:23:00.494
Eight letters...

349
00:23:03.394 --> 00:23:05.094
Could it be...

350
00:23:11.794 --> 00:23:13.894
Renya Carasuma.

351
00:23:16.494 --> 00:23:20.294
If I'm right, then you're making

352
00:23:20.294 --> 00:23:25.094
an enemy out of the most powerful man in the country.

353
00:23:25.094 --> 00:23:28.194
The multi-millionaire who doesn't exist.

354
00:23:28.194 --> 00:23:33.094
So until this is over, Yukiko and I are staying in Japan

355
00:23:33.094 --> 00:23:36.094
to come up with a plan together.

356
00:23:36.094 --> 00:23:39.694
This is the moment of truth, Shinichi...

357
00:23:39.694 --> 00:23:43.194
No, Conan Edogawa.

358
00:23:43.194 --> 00:23:44.494
Yeah.

359
00:23:44.494 --> 00:23:46.294
Just what I was hoping for.

360
00:23:54.394 --> 00:23:55.694
"Next Episode"

361
00:23:55.694 --> 00:23:58.394
Tokyo Barls Collection?

362
00:23:58.394 --> 00:23:59.794
What's that?

363
00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:03.794
What's wrong, madam?

364
00:24:04.994 --> 00:24:07.294
I can't breathe...

365
00:24:07.294 --> 00:24:09.194
Have some water.
