1
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:05,743
My name's Shinichi Kudo!

2
00:00:05,743 --> 00:00:07,323
Until just recently, I was
a famous high school detective

3
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:08,863
known throughout the entire country!

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:10,693
But a mysterious organization
forced me to take a pill,

5
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:12,143
turning me into Conan Edogawa!

6
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:13,243
Doesn't matter if I'm small!

7
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:14,653
My mind is that of
a former great detective,

8
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,033
and no matter what sort
of incident takes place,

9
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:18,273
there is always only one truth!

10
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,860
The Threatening Monthly Presents.

11
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,910
You know Shinichi Kudo, Ran?!

12
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,010
Eh? Well, yeah...

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,700
Awesome!

14
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,480
I can't believe you know the
super-famous high school detective!

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,740
He wouldn't happen to be
your boyfriend, would he?

16
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,490
No! Nothing of the sort!
No! Nothing of the sort!

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,740
Why are you reacting the same way?

18
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,660
No, it's just that--

19
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,230
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?!

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,930
Oh, well, you see...

21
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,670
I can't really answer that!

22
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,810
We're home!

23
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,820
Come to think of it,
what could Shinichi be doing?

24
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,120
It's been a while since
I last heard anything from him...

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,590
The case he's working on
has probably hit a hard spot!

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,960
But normally he solves all of his
cases without any problems at all...

27
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,530
Do you think that maybe he's...

28
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,740
...gotten worse at being a detective?

29
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,200
Coming!

30
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,840
What's going on?

31
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm so sorry, little boy!

32
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,200
Are you all right?

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,450
Yeah...

34
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,020
My name is Ogawa.

35
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,200
Since about 2 years ago,

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,730
someone has been sending me toys
and money every month.

37
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,450
It's kind of creepy

38
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,370
because the sender's name
and address are always made-up.

39
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,280
Toys and money, huh?

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,840
Do you have any children?

41
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,780
Yes. A 5-year old son named Yuta.

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,750
Exactly how much money
have they been sending?

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,740
1 million yen each month.

44
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,180
It will total 25 million this month!

45
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,120
25 million?!
25 million?!

46
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,740
Yuta loves the fact that
new toys come every month,

47
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,430
but being sent money is too creepy
for me so I haven't touched any of it.

48
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,330
If that's the case, I wouldn't mind
holding on to the money for you!

49
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,360
Dad!

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,900
I was just kidding!

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,670
Do you have any ideas
who it could be?

52
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,150
No.

53
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,110
Are you sure it isn't
one of your patients?

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,820
Patients?

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,580
You're a surgeon, aren't you?

56
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,280
I am...

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,740
Then it wouldn't be strange for
one of the patients you saved

58
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,110
to send all this to you in appreciation
for your help, would it?

59
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,450
No...

60
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,190
Huh? I don't remember
mentioning that I was a surgeon...

61
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,200
How did you know that, Conan-kun?!

62
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,950
It was his index fingers.

63
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,170
My fingers?

64
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,210
You have diagonal marks
on your fingers, right?

65
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,450
When performing operations,

66
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,110
surgeons use both index fingers
to sew tight sutures.

67
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,820
Over time, it causes diagonal marks
to appear on their index fingers!

68
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,360
Is he right?!

69
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,320
Yes...

70
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,790
In fact, I performed a surgery
just this very morning.

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,570
Excellent work, my lad!

72
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,110
This kid knows all sorts
of weird stuff...

73
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,730
But that was amazing, Conan-kun!

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,280
That was almost like--

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
Almost like...

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,270
You're in a gymnastics club, aren't you?

77
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,850
Only people who train on the horizontal
bar ever get this many blisters.

78
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,490
Almost like Shinichi...

79
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,480
H-He couldn't be...

80
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,560
He couldn't be.

81
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,370
This came today.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,910
There doesn't seem to be anything
strange besides the money...

83
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,480
No! Normally it's a much larger package
with both toys and money in it!

84
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,630
This is the first time
it's been like this...

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
A letter.

86
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,610
I have finished paying the 25 million yen.
I will be coming to get what is mine.

87
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,350
What exactly does this mean?

88
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,590
Your guess is as good as mine.

89
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,820
Hey, why don't these have
those line patterns on them?

90
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,150
Line patterns?

91
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,160
There's one on that.

92
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,140
Oh, you mean a barcode.

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,100
That is strange.

94
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,270
There aren't any on
any of these things!

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
They don't sell these
toys in stores anymore...

96
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,630
And it looks like some
have been damaged...

97
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,190
Come to think of it, ever since
the toys started coming in,

98
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,090
some of them were worn out,
and others were completely broken.

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,270
In other words, they've either
been sending used toys

100
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,350
or toys that they had
purchased quite a while ago.

101
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,790
Along with the large sums of money!

102
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,230
But why?!

103
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,230
Most likely...

104
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,800
...it's just an ordinary prank!

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,740
A prank?

106
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,940
Yup, no doubt about it.

107
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,050
No, it's too complicated
for a simple prank.

108
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,530
And sending all that money for
no reason would be pointless...

109
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,960
And then there's that letter...

110
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,520
You have such excellent
powers of deduction, Mori-san!

111
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,250
That was nothing at all.

112
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,490
No! Dad didn't figure
any of those things out!

113
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,470
It was all because of Conan-kun!

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
He couldn't be...

115
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,890
He couldn't be!

116
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,980
So this letter is the only
clue as to who the sender is...

117
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,230
Say, do you think the sender
could be trying to buy something

118
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,820
from Ogawa-san?

119
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,280
Depending on how you interpret it,
it could mean something like that.

120
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,520
Now that you mention it...

121
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,850
There is a painting in the hospital
that my grandfather left me.

122
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,220
I'm pretty sure they said that it
was worth about 20 million yen...

123
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,900
That's it!

124
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,460
The sender must want
to buy that painting from you!

125
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,420
Let's all go to the hospital
and have a look at the painting!

126
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,980
We may find more details!

127
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,110
Okay! Let's go!

128
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,850
Beika Hospital

129
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,690
This certainly is a large hospital!

130
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,690
I, too, was surprised when
I first came here 3 years ago.

131
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,780
I was transferred here from
a small rural hospital, you see...

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,190
Ogawa-sensei. Another one of these.

133
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,990
Another one this year, huh?

134
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,190
Morning glories?
With the weather as cold as it is?

135
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,480
I can only assume that the person has
been growing them in a greenhouse.

136
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,650
Wait, they've been sending these too?

137
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,670
Yes, the same person has
been sending these as well.

138
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,850
But the flowers only come once a year.

139
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,130
On today, February 19th.

140
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,230
Sending flowers must mean
the sender is female...

141
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,560
The phrase associated with morning
glories is "a short-lived love."

142
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,100
Don't tell me you did something
with another woman 2 years ago...

143
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,560
Nothing of the sort!

144
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,400
Then could it be your son's
birthday or something?

145
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,490
Yuta's birthday is in December.

146
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,520
If it's okay with him,

147
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,700
why don't we have a look at
Ogawa-sensei's medical records?

148
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,270
There might be a patient who has
something to do with February 19th!

149
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,650
That's right.

150
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,160
May we have a look?

151
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,140
I'm not allowed to show
the records to other people...

152
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,440
Can't we bend the rules just this once?

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,880
Very well. I suppose
I have no other choice.

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,090
Sorry to bother you like this!

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,220
Well, here are all of my patients'
records for the past 3 years.

156
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,810
And there's nobody in here
who might want that painting?

157
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,850
No.

158
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,190
Say, would you like to see
the painting for yourself?

159
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,670
Sure.

160
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,910
It's hanging in the patients' waiting room.

161
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,380
You're not coming, Conan-kun?

162
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,830
I'll wait here!

163
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,650
Ok. Then be a good boy
and behave yourself!

164
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,080
Ok!

165
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,810
The painting is quite popular
among many of the patients too!

166
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,810
Conan-kun!
Something's not right!

167
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,560
He's acting too strangely for
an ordinary grade school student!

168
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah! Back then, too!

169
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,280
So this dog barks
at all strangers then?

170
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,980
And that other time too!

171
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,770
How did you know this was a lighter
if you've never been here before?

172
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,000
It was almost like Shinichi
was giving suggestions!

173
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah!

174
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,330
The day Shinichi disappeared...

175
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,580
...Conan-kun showed up,
in his place, almost...

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,360
Could he actually be Shinichi?!

177
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,560
I'll have to make sure!

178
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,730
Here goes!

179
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,220
What're you doing?!

180
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,350
You shouldn't be reading people's
records without permission!

181
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,860
R-Ran!

182
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,310
Did you find anything?

183
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,060
Yeah, sort of.

184
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,330
He said earlier that the flowers are sent
to the hospital once a year, right?

185
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,300
That makes me think that
it was a former patient here.

186
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,810
It was 2 years ago when he started
receiving the toys and the money,

187
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,810
so that narrows it down
to patients who were here

188
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,760
during Ogawa-san's first year
at this hospital.

189
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,850
Among them, there are 8 people

190
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,720
who have something
to do with February 19th.

191
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,850
People whose surgeries
were successful on that day,

192
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,350
or people who were released
or checked in on that day.

193
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,690
Sending flowers most likely means
the person is grateful to him,

194
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,030
but they bother me...

195
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,240
The morning glories grown with care
in a greenhouse, and that letter...

196
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,700
It's amazing that you could
figure that much out!

197
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,140
Great work, Shinichi!

198
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,810
It was nothing--

199
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:24,949
I knew it!

200
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,669
You are Shinichi!

201
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:30,469
W-What are you talking about, Ran?

202
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,679
My name's Conan! Conan!

203
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,179
Stop playing around!

204
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,439
Not good! She's found me out!

205
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,889
If word gets out that
I'm actually Shinichi Kudo,

206
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,069
they'll come back to kill me!

207
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:47,719
And if that happens,

208
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:50,389
they might go after Ran
and the others as well!

209
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,029
I have to fool her somehow!

210
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,579
Wow! A Game Man!
And Yaiba's Great Adventure!

211
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,679
Go Yaiba! Beat up Onimaru!

212
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,379
This is fun!

213
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,179
I think he's faking!
It's too suspicious!

214
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:10,069
Conan-kun must really be Shinichi...

215
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,349
But this sort of thing doesn't happen...

216
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:14,509
This isn't a science
fiction movie, after all...

217
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,349
Wait a minute!

218
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:17,639
If he really is, then...

219
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,639
Say, Conan-kun.

220
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,519
Is there anyone you like?

221
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,429
I have someone I really like!

222
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,779
Don't tell me it's that Shinichi boy
you were looking for earlier?

223
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,719
That's right!

224
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,179
He's always been kind
of a tease since he was a kid,

225
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,619
and he's always been so full
of himself and a big mystery geek,

226
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,099
but he's also courageous,
cool, and dependable!

227
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,169
I really like Shinichi a lot!

228
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:54,099
Oh no! Game over!

229
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,259
Hey, you wanna try, Ran?

230
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,469
You like this sort of thing, don't you?

231
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:00,429
L-Like...

232
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,119
I do not! Don't get the wrong idea!

233
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,969
You don't? I'll keep playing then...

234
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,389
Tomoya Ogino?

235
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,859
Huh? Ogawa-san said
his son was named Yuta...

236
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,079
Normally you enter your own name
or the name of a character you like...

237
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,669
Wait. Tomoya Ogino.

238
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,209
Where have I seen this name before?

239
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,079
That's it!

240
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,249
Here it is!

241
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,389
Tomoya Ogino, 5 years old.

242
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,719
He died after Ogawa-san
operated on him.

243
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,799
Three years ago, on February 19th!

244
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,689
I have finished paying the 25 million yen.
I will be coming to get what is mine.

245
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,189
The letter couldn't mean
what I think it does!

246
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:48,109
Ran! Bring Mr. Ogawa here right away!

247
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,779
Hurry! There's no time!

248
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:54,179
It has to be!

249
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,719
That tone, his mannerisms,
his deductions...

250
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:59,409
They're all exactly like Shinichi's!
No question about it!

251
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,549
Did you really find out
who the sender is?!

252
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,329
I think it might be the parents
of Tomoya Ogino-kun here!

253
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:10,099
Tomoya Ogino?

254
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,299
The one who died of appendicitis
three years ago!

255
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:15,969
People can die from appendicitis?

256
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,759
Yes. If it's not detected early enough...

257
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,759
It was already too late for him when
they brought him in to the hospital...

258
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,939
The boy's father absolutely
would not listen to me, however...

259
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,909
But why would he send you presents
if the operation wasn't successful?

260
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,599
They're neither presents nor used goods!

261
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,759
They're the belongings of the late
Tomoya Ogino, who died 3 years ago!

262
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:49,009
In other words, he's been sending
all of his son's keepsakes!

263
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,589
Sending them out of hatred!

264
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:54,179
The flowers are delivered
to the hospital every February 19th

265
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:56,099
because it's the anniversary
of his son's death!

266
00:15:56,719 --> 00:16:00,679
And that letter means that he's going
to take the life of Ogawa-san's son

267
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,719
on the exact same day!

268
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,759
What?!

269
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,889
Where's your son right now?!

270
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,689
My wife should be on her way
to pick him up at school!

271
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,399
Contact her at once!

272
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,919
Someone already picked him up?!

273
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:17,049
They told me his father
had already picked him up!

274
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,429
It wasn't you?!

275
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,869
T-This can't be happening...

276
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,469
This is bad!

277
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,599
If we don't find them soon,
Yuta-kun's a goner!

278
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,219
Where's the school?!

279
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,509
It isn't very far from here...

280
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:30,629
Then they're still nearby!

281
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,339
Conan-kun!

282
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,549
Look, little boy.

283
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,049
I have a present for you!

284
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:42,849
Yay!

285
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,079
Thank you, Mister!

286
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:51,049
Hey, are you really gonna take me
to a fun place after this?

287
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,659
Sure. I'll take you there soon.

288
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:56,629
To where Tomoya is.

289
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,629
Where?! Where are they?!

290
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:04,349
Tomoya!

291
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,799
It must have been lonely
all by yourself!

292
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,059
I'll bring you a friend soon!

293
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,609
Right now, in fact!

294
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,669
That's Yuta!

295
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,129
What?!

296
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:24,189
Not good!

297
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:29,679
Here goes! Try this on for size!

298
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,719
Go!

299
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:03,759
Did Conan-kun do that just now?!

300
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,139
Yuta!

301
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,569
Daddy!

302
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:10,429
Yuta!

303
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:14,599
Stop right there!

304
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,799
Move and you know what'll happen!

305
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,069
Ogino-san! So it was you!

306
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,469
That's right! It was me!

307
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,259
I'm the father of Tomoya Ogino,

308
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,149
who you killed 3 years ago when
you messed up his operation!

309
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,679
It wasn't my fault!

310
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,249
It was already too late
when they carried him--

311
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:34,469
Shut up! As if you would understand
the feelings of a father

312
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,829
whose son was murdered
just after he turned 5!

313
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:42,509
All I had left were his remains
and the 25 million in insurance money!

314
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,759
So that's why you sent all that money...

315
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,389
That's right.

316
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:50,139
The money, his toys, and the
morning glories that he loved so much!

317
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:52,519
It was with my hatred
that I sent them all to you!

318
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,099
Now it's your turn to feel what
it's like to lose your own son!

319
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:00,439
Please! Don't hurt my son!

320
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,859
Kill me instead!

321
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:07,259
Just let my son go!

322
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,539
Oh! So you were the one
who sent the toys!

323
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,719
Thank you, Mister!

324
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,499
I always take good care of them all!

325
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,419
T-Tomoya!

326
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:28,079
Tomoya...

327
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,299
What's wrong, Mister?

328
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,519
Did Daddy and the others
say something bad to you?

329
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,429
No, little boy.

330
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,489
I was the bad one.

331
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,639
I knew.

332
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:42,459
I knew from the very start
that it wasn't his fault.

333
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,759
But I had to fool myself into
thinking it was, or else I...

334
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,829
I'm sorry, little boy! I'm so sorry!

335
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,259
Ran. Call the police.

336
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:01,639
Wait! Please don't get
the police involved!

337
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:04,009
But he just tried to kill your son.

338
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,679
It's all right.

339
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,649
I see...

340
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:15,009
Ogino-san. I know exactly how you feel.

341
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:18,689
After all, I am a father
before I'm a doctor.

342
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,069
How lucky it was that it didn't
turn into a serious incident.

343
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,279
But why did he send the money
and toys for 2 whole years?

344
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,179
He was probably waiting
for Yuta-kun to turn 5 first.

345
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,509
The same age that Tomoya-kun
was when he died 3 years ago...

346
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,259
I see!

347
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,679
Excellent deduction skills
you have there.

348
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:45,659
But I'm just a kid so I don't
really know for sure!

349
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,009
I just remembered
something I have to do!

350
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:49,379
Go on home without me!

351
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:53,569
What's with him?

352
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:29,459
I'm home!

353
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,899
Huh? Where's your dad?

354
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:34,429
He went drinking.

355
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:38,329
You must be hungry.
I'll make you something.

356
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:39,649
Okay!

357
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,849
Oh, yeah!

358
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:43,749
I hear our shop teacher Kishida-sensei
is getting married!

359
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,769
That gorilla?

360
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:53,849
How do you know about
my high school teacher?

361
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:57,759
No, uh, you're always talking
about how he's a gorilla!

362
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,019
Liar!

363
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,479
I couldn't believe it at first,
but I guess you really are Shinichi!

364
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,859
No, I'm...

365
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:08,409
Just confess already! Shinichi!

366
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:14,309
T-The phone...

367
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,199
Let it ring!

368
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,259
B-But...

369
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:20,729
Alright! I'll pick it up!

370
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,729
Yeah, this is the Mori Detective--

371
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:28,079
Hey, Ran!

372
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,519
It's been a while!

373
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,299
S-Shinichi?

374
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,809
No way! You're right--

375
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,509
Hey, now. Have you already
forgotten the sound of my voice?

376
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,229
How cruel!

377
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:42,279
Darn that Shinichi!

378
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:46,559
Please, Professor Agasa!
I think Ran's on to me!

379
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,599
Call her using my voice!

380
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,229
He shouldn't have made her
worry so much like that!

381
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:54,209
Hey, Ran.

382
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,179
Are you there, Ran?

383
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:01,439
I'm so stupid! I think
I misunderstood things!

384
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,119
No, it's nothing.

385
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:07,059
Say, Shinichi. Have you started
using words that old men use?

386
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,479
Have I?

387
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,809
You're a life-saver.

388
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:17,839
There are so many beautiful paintings!

389
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,229
I'm so glad we came!

390
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:22,269
Look at this! The colors are lovely!

391
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:34,619
What's with that expression?!

392
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,589
What's on the card that
he's so shocked about?!

393
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:40,179
On the next Conan--

394
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,709
The Murder of the Art Museum Owner.

395
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,497

396
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:08,499
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:10,946
Ball Pen Observation.
