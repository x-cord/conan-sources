1
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:03,124
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,124 --> 00:00:05,124
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,824
Youth Detective Squad is looking for a lost wristwatch.

4
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:09,024
We encountered a big case.

5
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:10,724
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:15,024
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:01,237
It's so cute!

9
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:02,437
This is me.

10
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:05,737
All of them look just like us!

11
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:08,437
Are you sure it's okay for us to take these chocolates?

12
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:10,937
Yes! I made it with all my skills

13
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:14,237
at the lodge just for all of you!

14
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:17,137
When did you make this, though?

15
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,837
I didn't see it on the desk of the lodge.

16
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:21,437
I made it as I try-out at first

17
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:24,337
and kept it in the refrigerator!

18
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:27,137
I'll go make you some tea, so wait here, okay?

19
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:29,237
Okay...

20
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:33,937
Judging from the way she's acting,

21
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:37,237
it seems you somehow succeeded in getting the chocolate

22
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:40,737
from Ran who was in tears.

23
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:43,437
How'd you know she was in tears?

24
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:47,237
A creation reflects the heart of its creator.

25
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,237
Just take a look at this chocolate!

26
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:52,937
It's laughing but it has a sad face.

27
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:55,737
Now that you mentioned it...

28
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:59,637
Gosh, a face so sad that it seems as if

29
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,437
it's going to break out in tears any minute.

30
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,237
She's trying so hard.

31
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:09,737
You sometimes talk like a girl, don't you?

32
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,937
What? Do I look like a boy?

33
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:20,037
"Forgotten Keepsake of a Crime (Part 1)"

34
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,637
This is good!

35
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,137
You're right.

36
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,437
It's like chocolate that're sold in stores!

37
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:31,737
Would you mind holding the noise down a bit more?

38
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:34,737
I can't concentrate on my work.

39
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:36,337
Sorry...

40
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:39,837
We'll leave as soon as we drink our tea.

41
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,637
Are you really working?

42
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,037
I heard that you're always sleeping.

43
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:46,337
You idiot!

44
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,737
Can't you see that I'm listening to the tape of my client even now?

45
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:52,237
All the horses have started off at once...

46
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:54,237
What's that?

47
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:56,237
Horse racing, right?

48
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,537
Well, you see, this is...

49
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:03,137
Yes, one moment please.

50
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:06,537
See? The client's come just as expected!

51
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,637
What makes you think that a man like me who is bombarded

52
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,637
with job requests for investigations all over Japan

53
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:14,937
has spare time at all?

54
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:20,337
So, I wonder what kind of difficult case I'm dealing with today.

55
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:21,937
Welcome.

56
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,137
Well...

57
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:28,437
"Hideo Morita (49), Client" -I request a search for a lost wristwatch.

58
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,837
I see.

59
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:36,537
So the wristwatch you're looking for is your late wife's.

60
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:37,937
Yes.

61
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,937
It's an old hand-wind type wristwatch

62
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:42,837
that I sent my wife some time ago.

63
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,437
Why do you need the wristwatch now?

64
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:47,237
Your wife died, didn't she?

65
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:50,537
I get it! You want to take it to the pawn shop?

66
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,937
No.

67
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:55,737
My wife comes to my bed side night after night

68
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:59,537
and asks me, "What time is it now, dear?"

69
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:04,537
I... I'm sure you're just tired.

70
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,437
I think so too.

71
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:12,037
And? Did you lose it when you went out somewhere?

72
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:14,837
Or was it a thief or something?

73
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:18,037
Well, I think it's somewhere in the house.

74
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,237
What?

75
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,237
My wife was quite careless,

76
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,437
there were times when she was looking for her lipstick

77
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:26,037
that she left under some magazines for a whole day.

78
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,637
Therefore, I think that if I find the wristwatch,

79
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,637
she'll be able to rest in peace.

80
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:30,837
You must be kidding!

81
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:34,037
If it's in the house, go and look for it yourself!

82
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:38,537
But I'm just as careless as my wife.

83
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:40,737
I'm the renowned detective Kogoro Mouri, you know?

84
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:43,937
I can't be bothered with trivial stuff like that!

85
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:48,937
What? Mouri? You mean that famous "Sleeping Kogoro"?

86
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:52,837
He's planning to slack off!

87
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:57,137
He's like those snobbish shops that pick their customers.

88
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:00,437
There shouldn't be a case that's too big or too small to take on.

89
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:05,737
But if you insist you want to look for the wristwatch, then...

90
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:08,537
No, I'll look for someone else to do it for me.

91
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,837
I just happened to come across your sign outside and went in.

92
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,337
What?

93
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:27,137
Where'd the client and everybody go?

94
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:31,137
They've all disappeared somewhere.

95
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,537
Hey!

96
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:44,137
Shall we help you look for the wristwatch you lost?

97
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,937
Of course, we won't charge you for it.

98
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:53,237
Hello...

99
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,937
What beautiful flowers!

100
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:01,137
But some of them are bent.

101
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:05,137
Yes. These are flowers that my wife arranged before she died.

102
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:07,537
Even if I change the water every day,

103
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:09,437
the more days pass, the more they bend.

104
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:13,737
That means that it hasn't been that long since your wife passed away.

105
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:16,437
No, she passed away just three weeks ago

106
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,237
in a traffic accident.

107
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,837
What's with this room?

108
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,237
That's...

109
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,037
This is amazing!

110
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:28,437
It's full of audio equipment!

111
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:29,737
What a big television!

112
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,837
It's like a small little movie theatre, isn't it?

113
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:35,237
Hey, this is the English version of "Gomera", isn't it?

114
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:39,237
Yes! I went all the way to the States to buy it.

115
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:41,537
Videos, LDs, DVDs,

116
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:45,137
AV amp, as selector and TV monitor...

117
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:48,537
So many remote controls on the desk.

118
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:51,537
The floor is full of stacks of pamphlets.

119
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,837
It comes as no surprise that things might get lost here.

120
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:59,837
Well, the only messy room is this one.

121
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:04,737
What? It seems you have a guest.

122
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,437
Yes, it seems so.

123
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,237
Give it.

124
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:15,437
Do you have it?

125
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:19,037
Yes, five billion yen for now.

126
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:21,937
"Eiko Idezuki (46), Resident" -Five billion yen?

127
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,837
You're missing 15 billion yen?

128
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,937
I was thinking of selling this room to get the remainder ready.

129
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,037
Is that right?

130
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:33,737
I'm sorry that it sure looks like I'm evicting you or something.

131
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,037
And, just as a token of my appreciation to you

132
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:39,237
for having waited for me to return the money to you,

133
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:43,437
I found the video tape "Sakura Sanjuro"

134
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:45,237
that you've been looking for.

135
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,237
Really?

136
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,937
Then I hope you don't mind me viewing it right now

137
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:51,837
on this big screen here.

138
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,837
No, please do.

139
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:57,237
Oh, my. Who are these children?

140
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,237
Well...

141
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,537
Come now, all of you!

142
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,137
Never mind this room for now. Please search another room.

143
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:10,137
After you finish watching it, can you please return it

144
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,937
to the manager of the video tape shop in front of the station?

145
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:14,737
It seems to be a valuable video tape

146
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:16,737
that they don't even have at the shop.

147
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,537
Sure. Okay.

148
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,637
I was just going to go out anyway.

149
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,837
Then, please enjoy yourself.

150
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:27,937
Okay. I'll watch this enjoy myself

151
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:30,937
thinking it to be the interest for the money I lent you.

152
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:39,137
Which room shall we search next?

153
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:41,137
How about the living room then?

154
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:45,237
Secret technique of the sword, Sakura Fubuki!

155
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:47,737
The cherry blossoms are suddenly.

156
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:51,537
That lady is sure blasting the volume while watching.

157
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,337
It sure sounds like an interesting movie, though!

158
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:57,837
Hey... start looking for it, or the sun will start setting.

159
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:00,337
Okay.

160
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:02,037
But Haibara,

161
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:05,837
we've already searched all the room, yet nothing.

162
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:09,237
I'm so hungry I can't move.

163
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,937
Shall I make you some sandwiches then?

164
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,037
What?

165
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:18,437
I run a coffee shop in the next town,

166
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:21,037
so I've got the ingredients.

167
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,837
As a token of my appreciation to you for looking for the wristwatch,

168
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,537
let me make it for you!

169
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,837
-All right! -Thank you!

170
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:34,137
Shall I help you?

171
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,237
No, thanks.

172
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,537
I can handle it alone.

173
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,837
Okay, I guess we'll give it one last search

174
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:42,937
until the sandwiches are made.

175
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,437
Okay...

176
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,837
Here you go, eat to your heart's content.

177
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,837
It looks super delicious.

178
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:52,237
Clubhouse sandwiches!

179
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,637
Just as would be expected of a professional!

180
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,737
I wonder if anyone of you can take some sandwiches

181
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,537
over to Ms. Idezuki who is watching the movie?

182
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:01,537
I'll take it to her!

183
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,337
I'll go too, then!

184
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,137
Thank you.

185
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:08,437
I see. The Musashi of the Showa era.

186
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:11,637
You're cute.

187
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,837
But your sword is clouded with greed and ambition.

188
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:19,137
We brought you your tea and sandwich.

189
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,237
You can never slash Musashi.

190
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:24,437
This is the best part!

191
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:26,537
Just leave it on the desk.

192
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:28,537
Sakura Sanjuro comes. -Okay.

193
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,437
Did Ms. Idezuki say it tastes good?

194
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:39,437
No, she's watching the best part, so she'll eat it later.

195
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:43,437
Well, she's a movie-lover, so I guess it can't be helped.

196
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:49,537
What're those clothes in the plastic bag?

197
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:53,537
The laundry. I'm going to the coin laundry to wash them.

198
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:56,037
But there was a washing machine in the bathroom!

199
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:59,037
I don't know how to operate that washing machine without my wife

200
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:01,337
because it's sort of difficult to use.

201
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:05,937
Did your wife wear the wristwatch you're looking for all the time?

202
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,937
Yes, she liked it so much

203
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,237
that she had it on until the day

204
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:13,237
before she got into the accident.

205
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:15,837
She virtually never took it off.

206
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:19,437
But, she'd take it off when taking a bath, right?

207
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:27,237
Conan!

208
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,637
Here's the wristwatch!

209
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,137
It's moving just fine too!

210
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,737
What?

211
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,837
See!

212
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:40,637
Thank you!

213
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:43,637
This is my wife's wristwatch!

214
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,637
I see.

215
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,937
She probably took it off before taking a bath

216
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:52,037
and threw it inside the washing machine together with her clothes.

217
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,837
No, it was not.

218
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:57,337
That wristwatch wasn't lost to begin with!

219
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:59,437
Then, what is it?

220
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:02,437
Why is he making up a lie like this?

221
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:08,837
What is it? That's the sound of something cracking.

222
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,737
And the sound of somebody running.

223
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,437
Don't tell me that...

224
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:15,437
Hey, what was that sound?

225
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:18,437
Next, it's the sound of the front door closing.

226
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:21,237
The flower vase is gone?

227
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,237
What... what happened?

228
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,237
Hey, Conan?

229
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,737
Ms... Ms. Idezuki?

230
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:47,787
The murder weapon is the vase that had water and flowers in it.

231
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:50,887
The killer probably took the vase and snuck up from behind,

232
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:53,587
then attacked the victim with the vase.

233
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:56,287
One hit on the back of the head.

234
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:58,487
Beaten to death.

235
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:02,687
It seems that the victim Ms. Eiko Idezuki, 46 years old,

236
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:06,287
is a resident of this condo.

237
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:10,287
So the owner of this room, Mr. Hideo Morita.

238
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,487
What is the relationship between you and Ms. Idezuki?

239
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:17,287
She lent me money.

240
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,287
She came here today to get some of it back.

241
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,487
When I gave her the money

242
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,987
together with the video tape she had been looking for,

243
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:26,887
she said she wanted to watch it right away

244
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,987
and that's why she was in this audio room.

245
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:33,387
And you came to this room after you heard the vase crack,

246
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:37,987
then found Ms. Idezuki lying here bleeding from her head?

247
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,087
Yes.

248
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,287
The movie Ms. Idezuki was watching

249
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:45,287
is this video tape she was holding in her left hand.

250
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:46,587
The video deck she was using...

251
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:50,287
judging from the remote control she was holding in her right hand,

252
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:51,887
it is this deck.

253
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,187
"Sakura Sanjuro"

254
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,287
It's "Sakura Sanjuro"!

255
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,787
How nostalgic.

256
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:01,287
Inspector Megure, you know this story?

257
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:05,287
Yes, if I remember correctly, it started off something like

258
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:09,187
"The path you are to walk along is as beautiful as a flower."

259
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,387
"And you are to live..."

260
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:13,187
"As strong as the trunk of a tree!"

261
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:14,487
Right?

262
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,287
We heard the movie!

263
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:19,387
Because the lady was watching the movie full blast!

264
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:22,387
Why... why are you all here?

265
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:26,087
We came to help to search for something that was lost!

266
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:30,287
A hand-winding wristwatch that Mr. Morita's wife had misplaced

267
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,487
the day before she passed away!

268
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:37,587
Well, although Conan already found it in the bathroom.

269
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:41,587
Why did you ask the kids to help you look for something like that, though?

270
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:45,087
I asked Detective Mouri to help me search for it at first,

271
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:46,987
but was refused.

272
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:51,787
So, I had the children and Dr. Agasa who at the office to help me search.

273
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:55,587
I see. So Mr. Mouri's not here, then.

274
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,487
What? Did you want anything with him?

275
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:01,687
Nothing.

276
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:05,287
I just had something I wanted to confirm with Mr. Mouri.

277
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:08,787
"Sakura Sanjuro"

278
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:12,687
The tape has been rewound to the beginning.

279
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:15,587
It seems that she finished watching the movie

280
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:18,287
and when she took the tape out of the deck,

281
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:21,487
she was attacked from behind.

282
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,887
I don't mean to be rude, but where were you at that time?

283
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:28,187
I think I was in the bathroom.

284
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,187
He's telling the truth!

285
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:34,387
We heard vase crack right when Conan found the wristwatch

286
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:36,587
and Mr. Morita was with us in the bathroom!

287
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,387
After that, we heard the sound of someone running

288
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:41,487
and the front door is closing too.

289
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,387
The killer must've come from outside!

290
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:48,387
Which means that Mr. Morita was with you and the children right through?

291
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:52,387
No, he went into the kitchen to make some sandwiches part way.

292
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,787
The kitchen? Where's that?

293
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:58,187
It's way inside beyond this living room.

294
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,187
Over here.

295
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:08,887
Where were you then, Dr. Agasa?

296
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:12,587
I was in the living room here with the children.

297
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,287
If you open the door on the corridor side of this kitchen,

298
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,287
it is one straight line to the audio room where the corpse was found.

299
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,587
Yes.

300
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:28,887
Besides, it's a blind spot from the door of the living room.

301
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,587
It's possible to sneak out for a while in this situation.

302
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:34,387
What do you mean, Mr. Inspector?

303
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,787
In other words, the sound of the of the flower vase cracking,

304
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:40,787
the sound of footsteps and the sound of the front door closing...

305
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:44,587
If these were all sounds recorded beforehand by you,

306
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:45,987
you could've sneaked out of the kitchen

307
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,587
while pretending to make sandwiches,

308
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:49,587
and played the pre-recorded sounds

309
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:53,487
after beating Ms. Idezuki to death!

310
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,687
It's not strange that nobody heard her being beaten to death

311
00:17:56,687 --> 00:18:00,187
if she was listening to the movie

312
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,387
with the volume turned up high.

313
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:04,787
No way.

314
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:07,287
But, that's not possible!

315
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:12,287
Well, you saw the tea and sandwich in the audio room, didn't you?

316
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:17,787
Ayumi and I brought those to Ms. Idezuki.

317
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:21,387
At that time, she was still watching the video.

318
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:23,587
And when we heard the flower vase crack

319
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,687
and found the corpse,

320
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,487
Mr. Morita was with us right through until then.

321
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,287
I see.

322
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:37,287
Inspector Megure!

323
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:41,887
I've finished asking around the people of the condo just now!

324
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,587
It seems that Ms. Idezuki

325
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:49,387
had been lending money to some other residents of this condo,

326
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:50,887
and if they couldn't pay her back on time,

327
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,587
she would take the valuables

328
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,887
that those people owned as interest!

329
00:18:55,887 --> 00:19:00,187
Which means she didn't have that great of a reputation.

330
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:03,487
Besides, it seems that the people of the condo

331
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,287
knew that she was going to come here today!

332
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:07,587
What?

333
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:09,387
The sound of the movie.

334
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,387
It seems that she used to watch movies in this audio room

335
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,487
with the volume turned up full blast.

336
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,887
If they knew that she was going to be here,

337
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:21,987
it could be that the killer came from outside.

338
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:26,487
Okay, check everybody who had borrowed from Ms. Idezuki!

339
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:27,687
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

340
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,287
If it's a killer from outside,

341
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:34,287
I guess there won't be anything for you to do this time.

342
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:37,687
No, I think that the killer is Mr. Morita.

343
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,187
What? But you just mentioned a while ago

344
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:43,187
that it was impossible for him to commit the crime.

345
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:45,787
Don't you think something's fishy?

346
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:49,287
A hand-winding type wristwatch that was lost three weeks ago

347
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:52,187
was still moving accurately when we found it.

348
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:55,487
The longest a hand wound watch can keep on operating continuously

349
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,487
is at most 50 hours.

350
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,587
It could never go on ticking for three weeks if left as is!

351
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:04,887
Then don't tell me that the wristwatch is...

352
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:08,887
Yes. An excuse to get us to come here...

353
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:12,287
probably to set up an alibi.

354
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:13,887
But, it's for sure

355
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:18,987
that Mr. Morita didn't enters the audio room during the time of the crime.

356
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:22,487
I looked in on the kitchen in question every two to three minutes

357
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,187
but he was where he was supposed to be.

358
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:26,787
He hasn't made any suspicious moves

359
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:30,887
even after the corpse was found.

360
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:34,587
He could never had committed a crime like that.

361
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:37,087
By the way, Mr. Morita,

362
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:39,487
when you went to Mr. Mouri's office,

363
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:43,087
did you run into anyone suspicious in the vicinity?

364
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:44,887
No, not that I recall.

365
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,887
I see. Thank you.

366
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:53,087
Officer Takagi, what was that about?

367
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,287
Nothing.

368
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:00,487
Inspector and I are still considering

369
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:03,287
whether we should tell him in person.

370
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,287
It seems that

371
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:09,687
someone is secretly checking up on Mr. Mouri.

372
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,887
We found that the investigation records

373
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:17,987
that Mr. Mouri handled up within town were all disappeared

374
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,987
from the police department.

375
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,887
Since Officer Matsumoto had copies of the investigation records stored,

376
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:28,087
so it didn't cause any problems arose during the trial,

377
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,687
but surprisingly, all the investigation records

378
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,587
were sent back to the police department last night.

379
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:37,487
They were all in a sealed envelope with no return address on it.

380
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:40,487
And, when did the papers disappear?

381
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:44,387
I think it was...

382
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,987
the day when you and the others got messed up in a bus-jack.

383
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:52,987
We're investigating the case

384
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:55,687
as it may be a crime committed by a relative of the suspect

385
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,787
who is after Mr. Mouri's life out of hate for him.

386
00:21:57,787 --> 00:22:01,787
But, we haven't been able to come up with anyone for a while,

387
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,087
so we're thinking if we should protect Mr. Mouri with bodyguards.

388
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:09,187
But then it could be a simple prank too.

389
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:13,987
At any rate, if you see anybody suspicious around Mr. Mouri,

390
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:16,287
make sure you call the police right away!

391
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:18,487
Okay, I got it!

392
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:25,487
No, the one they're after is not Pops,

393
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:26,987
but maybe...

394
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:32,787
And maybe they are...

395
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,887
"Next Episode" -Hey.

396
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:09,587
Don't you smell something odd?

397
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:12,587
Now that you mentioned it, it does smell like something is burning.

398
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:15,987
Maybe it's the microwave oven over there?

399
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,587
There's no mistake about it,

400
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,587
the smell's coming from in here!

401
00:24:19,587 --> 00:24:21,987
There are some more sandwiches left!

402
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:24,487
May I eat this?

403
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:26,487
Gosh, Genta.

404
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,387
I see. So that's what it was.

405
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:35,308
"Forgotten Keepsake of a Crime (Part 2)"

406
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,705
Next Conan's hint:

407
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:40,105
"Sandwich"

408
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,605
-Next episode... -I got it!

409
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,305
Did pops get the right guy, or...

410
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:45,505
He got it.
