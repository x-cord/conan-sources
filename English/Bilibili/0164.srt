1
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.266
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.066
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.766
Today, the secret code is solved.

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.866
A small hint becomes a big thing.

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.366
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.766
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:56.804
After helping a toy company,

9
00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.604
Dr. Agasa received a sum of money

10
00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:02.404
and he planned the treasure hunt for the Youth Detective Squad.

11
00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.904
The location is the second house of Agasa's uncle.

12
00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:10.904
No one should be in the house for 50 years since he died

13
00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:16.504
but there were traces of someone living there secretly

14
00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.604
with strange codes.

15
00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:23.404
There were symbols like a moon, a star,

16
00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:27.704
and on things like a vase, a plate, and a candle stand.

17
00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:32.404
We found out toys hidden by Dr. Agasa

18
00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:36.104
for the treasure hunt were tattered

19
00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:39.804
so we felt that there was a big secret in this house.

20
00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.404
We found out 7 secret codes

21
00:02:44.404 --> 00:02:47.804
after looking around the house.

22
00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:54.404
Cards, French dictionary, record,

23
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:58.504
airplane, wine glass, portrait,

24
00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:00.704
and gadget doll.

25
00:03:01.904 --> 00:03:07.404
Dr. Agasa also remembered the same codes

26
00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:10.304
on a letter from the his aunt.

27
00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:16.804
And he brought it to my father, a detective story novelist.

28
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.904
Right. That novelist knew too.

29
00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:25.904
This secret code was all in "hiragana".

30
00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:27.104
Hiragana?

31
00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:29.204
Conan, is it true?

32
00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:32.104
It's best to think that the sender of those letters

33
00:03:32.104 --> 00:03:34.604
and the person who wrote this secret code

34
00:03:34.604 --> 00:03:37.704
are both the same person.

35
00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:41.804
But why did he send the secret code to my aunt?

36
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:45.104
He didn't want anybody but your aunt to know.

37
00:03:45.104 --> 00:03:47.604
For example, someone was after him.

38
00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:50.604
Come to think of it, my aunt said this.

39
00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:54.004
A strange guy often peeks into the mailbox.

40
00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:59.004
That's probably the guy who slashed up the toys.

41
00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:04.504
Something is going on in this house.

42
00:04:06.104 --> 00:04:11.904
"Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun (Part 2)"

43
00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:15.804
But even if we know that this secret code is in "hiragana",

44
00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:17.504
we haven't the faintest idea what's it about.

45
00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:20.804
Don't worry. If there's a hint, we've got it in the bag.

46
00:04:20.804 --> 00:04:21.904
What?

47
00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:24.304
For example, black sun.

48
00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:28.204
White sun, moon, star, and black moon,

49
00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:31.104
there's differences in the shape of the stars

50
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.304
but none in the black sun.

51
00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:34.904
In "hiragana",

52
00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:36.404
what's the letter that doesn't have a "step" or a "line"

53
00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:38.804
an outcast letter?

54
00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:41.304
Doesn't have a step or line?

55
00:04:41.304 --> 00:04:43.004
An outcast?

56
00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:45.804
I know! It's "un", right?

57
00:04:45.804 --> 00:04:50.004
That's it! The black sun represents "un".

58
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:52.004
The next thing to look at is

59
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:54.404
the three figures on the right

60
00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:56.204
that are the same in all the codes.

61
00:04:56.204 --> 00:05:00.404
It means that they hold a different meaning

62
00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:03.604
from the ones in the front.

63
00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:06.004
I see.

64
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:10.704
Next is the small black and white circles around the figures.

65
00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:14.204
We don't know the meaning of the black circle on the bottom right,

66
00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:16.704
but the black and white circles on the upper right

67
00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:18.004
judging from the position,

68
00:05:18.004 --> 00:05:21.604
they're probably G, Z and P sound points of "hiragana".

69
00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:24.704
Hey, what does G, Z and P sound points mean?

70
00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:27.704
Don't you remember learning it at school?

71
00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:29.904
G, Z sound points are those two raised slash-marks

72
00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:30.904
on the top right of the letter,

73
00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:33.804
they make up the "G" sounds and the "Z" sounds.

74
00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:36.004
The P sound point is that raised circle on the top right that

75
00:05:36.004 --> 00:05:38.604
make up the sounds "PA, PI, PU, PE, PO"!

76
00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.304
Let's take a look at the code again.

77
00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:43.804
The crescent moon facing up has a black circle,

78
00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:47.404
a white circle and no circle. There are three types.

79
00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:49.904
In other words, this crescent moon facing upward

80
00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:53.304
is one of the "HA" line letters.

81
00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:56.304
I see! The "HA" line is the only one

82
00:05:56.304 --> 00:05:58.504
that has G, Z and P sound points.

83
00:05:58.504 --> 00:06:00.104
With that in mind,

84
00:06:00.104 --> 00:06:04.704
the easiest to read would be this wine glass code.

85
00:06:04.704 --> 00:06:07.904
The four letters excluding the three on the right.

86
00:06:07.904 --> 00:06:10.704
The third black sun is "un".

87
00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.804
The fourth is a letter in the "pa" line.

88
00:06:13.804 --> 00:06:18.404
A word that uses letters "un" and one in the "pa" line...

89
00:06:18.404 --> 00:06:21.604
Panty, hairpin, pelican...

90
00:06:21.604 --> 00:06:24.704
Anpan bread, melon bread, curry bread...

91
00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:28.804
Personal computer, Japan, lamp...

92
00:06:28.804 --> 00:06:31.904
"To, ra, un, pu". It's cards!

93
00:06:31.904 --> 00:06:35.504
That's right! This probably says "cards".

94
00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:37.904
Wait a minute. If so...

95
00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:41.104
The secret code written on this candle stand...

96
00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:45.004
The first letters "pu" and the fourth letter will be "ra"...

97
00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.604
Pu... ra...

98
00:06:47.604 --> 00:06:48.804
"Pu, ro, pe, ra"!

99
00:06:48.804 --> 00:06:50.904
I see! It's "propeller"!

100
00:06:50.904 --> 00:06:54.704
Wait. If this black crescent moon is "ro",

101
00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:56.404
this code...

102
00:06:56.404 --> 00:07:00.204
Pu, ro, pe, ra... ro...

103
00:07:00.204 --> 00:07:01.804
Look.

104
00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:03.504
Look at the propeller!

105
00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:06.904
There's a code written on the backside of the plane's propeller.

106
00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:08.304
There sure is!

107
00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:11.004
If the black circle on the upper right is a G, Z sound point,

108
00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:14.904
the second letter is "bu", the third letter is "ra".

109
00:07:14.904 --> 00:07:17.104
Look at... "bu ra".

110
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.304
"Bu ra"?

111
00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.004
"Ah, bu, ra, eh"...

112
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.304
Look at the oil painting!

113
00:07:22.304 --> 00:07:24.304
It's talking about this portrait.

114
00:07:24.304 --> 00:07:26.104
All right, I've got it!

115
00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:32.304
The phrase "look at" is stuck on to everything named in this house.

116
00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:34.604
In other words, if you follow those clues,

117
00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:36.904
you'll reach something.

118
00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:42.204
Something so important a secret code had to be used to hide it.

119
00:07:42.204 --> 00:07:43.804
Really?

120
00:07:43.804 --> 00:07:48.304
Okay, we'll solve all the codes and get the treasure!

121
00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:50.004
Yes!

122
00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:53.804
Hey. Is there really a treasure hidden here?

123
00:07:53.804 --> 00:07:56.604
I don't know if it's treasure,

124
00:07:56.604 --> 00:08:00.004
but there's no mistake that something is hidden.

125
00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:03.604
Let's see. The code on the plate is...

126
00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:05.304
The third is "un",

127
00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:08.004
the second is a letter that has a G, Z sound point, so...

128
00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:11.804
Let's see... "Ka, bi, un"?

129
00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:14.604
Vase! The vase!

130
00:08:14.604 --> 00:08:17.204
The secret code on the dictionary is...

131
00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:20.404
Let's see... "Un, ro"...

132
00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:22.304
"Da, un, ro"!

133
00:08:22.304 --> 00:08:23.504
It's the fireplace!

134
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:26.904
If so, then the code on he gadget doll is...

135
00:08:26.904 --> 00:08:29.904
"Wa, I, un, gu, ra, su"...

136
00:08:29.904 --> 00:08:32.304
It's the wine glass!

137
00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:36.104
Huh? Conan.

138
00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:39.404
Until now, there's 17 letters that we know.

139
00:08:39.404 --> 00:08:41.804
And if we make deductions from the code...

140
00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:45.104
from the blank portions...

141
00:08:45.104 --> 00:08:47.404
Are you saying something?

142
00:08:47.404 --> 00:08:49.304
Here! Take a look at this!

143
00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:52.404
This is the chart to decode the secret code.

144
00:08:52.404 --> 00:08:55.304
This is great!

145
00:08:55.304 --> 00:08:56.704
As you can see,

146
00:08:56.704 --> 00:09:01.304
the sun, moon, and stars are "A, E, I, O, U" that mark each line.

147
00:09:01.304 --> 00:09:04.004
And all of it follow the same rule,

148
00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:06.704
you can tell it goes sideways too.

149
00:09:06.704 --> 00:09:08.904
For example, the sun and star...

150
00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:13.304
The thorns surrounding it are missing clockwise from the top.

151
00:09:13.304 --> 00:09:15.804
The moon goes clockwise too.

152
00:09:15.804 --> 00:09:18.404
And the black circle on the bottom right, that was a mystery,

153
00:09:18.404 --> 00:09:21.604
was a mark added when there wasn't enough figures.

154
00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:23.604
I see.

155
00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:26.404
Furthermore, if you use that chart to read all the secret codes

156
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:29.904
and connect them together...

157
00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:32.104
-This is what it becomes. -What?

158
00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.704
Let's see. Look at the vase.

159
00:09:34.704 --> 00:09:36.504
Look at the candle stand.

160
00:09:36.504 --> 00:09:37.904
Look at the propeller.

161
00:09:37.904 --> 00:09:39.304
Look at the oil painting.

162
00:09:39.304 --> 00:09:40.804
Look at the record.

163
00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:42.204
Look at the doll.

164
00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:43.704
Look at the wine glass.

165
00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:45.004
Look at the card.

166
00:09:45.004 --> 00:09:46.804
Look at the French dictionary.

167
00:09:46.804 --> 00:09:48.904
Look at the fireplace.

168
00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:50.104
The fireplace!

169
00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.004
Then, the treasure is in the fireplace!

170
00:09:57.404 --> 00:10:00.404
What's this? There's nothing here.

171
00:10:01.604 --> 00:10:03.804
A secret code! There's a secret code carved!

172
00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:05.804
What? Really?

173
00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:08.204
Ayumi, lend me that decoding chart.

174
00:10:08.204 --> 00:10:10.204
Sure!

175
00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:12.604
Here, Conan.

176
00:10:12.604 --> 00:10:14.904
Let's see, that code is...

177
00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:21.104
Hey. What's written?

178
00:10:21.104 --> 00:10:23.104
Hurry up and tell us!

179
00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:27.204
-Conan! -Don't keep us waiting.

180
00:10:27.204 --> 00:10:29.404
-Plates... -Huh?

181
00:10:29.404 --> 00:10:31.204
Look at the plate.

182
00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:32.304
What?

183
00:10:32.304 --> 00:10:36.004
Plate? The first plate we saw?

184
00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:39.004
Gosh. We're right back where we started.

185
00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:41.704
The code is spinning us in circles

186
00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:43.404
You're kidding.

187
00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:46.204
It's just a bad joke.

188
00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:48.304
Joke? That can't be.

189
00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:50.504
Using a secret code that maybe wouldn't be able to decoded?

190
00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:53.504
Would he do something so complicated?

191
00:10:53.504 --> 00:10:58.204
But if you follow the code, you go back to the beginning.

192
00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:01.304
Or, is it saying that this decoding chart is wrong?

193
00:11:02.304 --> 00:11:04.404
No, that can't be.

194
00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:11.704
There's gotta be something in the order of this code.

195
00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.404
A true meaning.

196
00:11:18.904 --> 00:11:20.404
It can't be helped.

197
00:11:20.404 --> 00:11:22.104
Let's put everything back to where they were

198
00:11:22.104 --> 00:11:24.804
before the police arrive.

199
00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:26.804
Yes...

200
00:11:34.404 --> 00:11:37.004
Let's see. The plate was in the cupboard.

201
00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:38.204
Wait a minute!

202
00:11:38.204 --> 00:11:41.604
If you connect the first letters of these plate and vase...

203
00:11:41.604 --> 00:11:45.004
"Sa, ka, ro, pu, ah, re, ni, wa, to, fu, da"...

204
00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.804
What's that?

205
00:11:49.504 --> 00:11:51.304
The vase goes here.

206
00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:55.604
Maybe if you change it to roman characters...

207
00:11:55.604 --> 00:11:58.104
The candle stand goes on the fireplace.

208
00:11:58.104 --> 00:11:59.404
I guess not.

209
00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:05.804
Dr. Agasa, this airplane... where was it?

210
00:12:05.804 --> 00:12:10.204
It was beside that vase. I took it to the bedroom.

211
00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:14.704
Beside the vase...

212
00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:16.904
Maybe I should try changing it to English?

213
00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:18.304
No, maybe French?

214
00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:20.404
Or maybe German?

215
00:12:20.404 --> 00:12:22.004
Record...

216
00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:24.304
Nothing seems to ring a bell.

217
00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.404
Doll...

218
00:12:31.004 --> 00:12:32.604
Huh?

219
00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:40.904
Hey.

220
00:12:40.904 --> 00:12:43.304
Why don't you help out a bit?

221
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.404
Don't just sit in the middle of the room.

222
00:12:46.404 --> 00:12:47.904
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

223
00:12:47.904 --> 00:12:51.104
You said the cards were in this room too, didn't you?

224
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:54.804
Yes. They were originally right below the clock,

225
00:12:54.804 --> 00:12:57.104
but I used them.

226
00:12:57.104 --> 00:12:59.204
Which means...

227
00:12:59.204 --> 00:13:03.204
all the items with the code written on them were in this room.

228
00:13:04.904 --> 00:13:06.404
Wait a minute.

229
00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:09.204
If you connect them with a line...

230
00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:14.204
Start from the plate, the vase, the candle stand,

231
00:13:14.204 --> 00:13:18.404
propeller, oil painting, record,

232
00:13:18.404 --> 00:13:22.904
doll, wine glass, card,

233
00:13:22.904 --> 00:13:27.304
French dictionary, fireplace, and the plate.

234
00:13:28.104 --> 00:13:31.504
It's concentrated in the center of the room!

235
00:13:31.504 --> 00:13:34.904
That's why Ayumi has passed by me so many times.

236
00:13:36.104 --> 00:13:37.504
But that's strange.

237
00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:39.704
This is the center of the room,

238
00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:42.304
but there's nothing different about it.

239
00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:44.204
It's not on the floor.

240
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.004
A groove at the base of the chandelier?

241
00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:54.004
-Let's put off the treasure hunt... -Dr. Agasa!

242
00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:56.004
-Let me ride your shoulder! -What?

243
00:13:56.004 --> 00:13:57.304
Hurry!

244
00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:59.404
All right.

245
00:14:03.204 --> 00:14:05.304
Whoop!

246
00:14:10.904 --> 00:14:13.604
What is this sound?

247
00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:16.404
Hey, what's going on?

248
00:14:17.404 --> 00:14:21.404
Sounds like something fell upstairs.

249
00:14:21.404 --> 00:14:23.304
Let's go and see!

250
00:14:23.304 --> 00:14:25.504
Hey, Conan!

251
00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:44.293
Right above that room...

252
00:14:47.693 --> 00:14:49.193
is this room.

253
00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:55.593
Conan, what's going on?

254
00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:58.593
There's stairs in the room.

255
00:14:58.593 --> 00:15:01.393
I see. So, that's it!

256
00:15:01.393 --> 00:15:03.793
That code was pointing at the chandelier trick

257
00:15:03.793 --> 00:15:05.693
in the center of the room.

258
00:15:05.693 --> 00:15:09.293
In other words, it was pointing out the hidden stairs in this room.

259
00:15:09.293 --> 00:15:13.593
I heard that my uncle liked gadgets,

260
00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:16.393
but I didn't think he had something like this set up.

261
00:15:18.093 --> 00:15:20.593
Then, could the treasure be up there?

262
00:15:20.593 --> 00:15:24.093
Yes, something is hidden, that's for sure.

263
00:15:24.093 --> 00:15:25.893
All right, let's hurry!

264
00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.993
What's this room?

265
00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:32.293
It's pitch black.

266
00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:34.293
At this rate, we can't see anything.

267
00:15:36.193 --> 00:15:38.493
Anyway, let's open the window.

268
00:15:40.293 --> 00:15:44.293
Unfinished 1 yen coins. And...

269
00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:46.493
this is is a tube of oil paint.

270
00:15:48.693 --> 00:15:51.193
Look! Something's on the desk.

271
00:15:51.193 --> 00:15:53.093
Is it treasure?

272
00:15:57.393 --> 00:15:59.393
Hey, what's the matter?

273
00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:04.593
What is it? Speak up.

274
00:16:04.593 --> 00:16:07.193
Skeleton!

275
00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:08.493
What?

276
00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:16.893
Who is that corpse?

277
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.993
Didn't I tell you a while ago?

278
00:16:18.993 --> 00:16:22.793
There was an old person with skilled hands living here.

279
00:16:22.793 --> 00:16:24.493
He's probably the one who carved the 1 yen coin

280
00:16:24.493 --> 00:16:27.293
and wrote those secret codes.

281
00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:29.893
He wasn't killed, was he?

282
00:16:29.893 --> 00:16:34.893
No. He passed away while writing a letter to your aunt.

283
00:16:36.493 --> 00:16:38.693
Looks like he had a bad heart.

284
00:16:38.693 --> 00:16:42.493
But how did he know about this hidden room?

285
00:16:42.493 --> 00:16:43.593
The only ones who knew about it

286
00:16:43.593 --> 00:16:47.393
were my uncle and aunt who lived here.

287
00:16:47.393 --> 00:16:49.093
There's one other, isn't there?

288
00:16:49.093 --> 00:16:50.793
Before your uncle died,

289
00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:54.193
there was a person who was and out of this house.

290
00:16:54.193 --> 00:16:56.393
Before my uncle died?

291
00:16:56.393 --> 00:16:58.293
Oh, that painting!

292
00:16:58.293 --> 00:17:03.093
Right. The portrait of your aunt and uncle

293
00:17:03.093 --> 00:17:05.193
is that artist who painted that picture.

294
00:17:05.193 --> 00:17:08.193
He probably heard about this hidden room from your uncle

295
00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:10.193
while doing the painting.

296
00:17:10.193 --> 00:17:13.893
But why did he have to live and hide here?

297
00:17:13.893 --> 00:17:17.793
And why he send those coded letters to my aunt?

298
00:17:17.793 --> 00:17:20.493
That reason is probably this.

299
00:17:20.493 --> 00:17:22.993
Huh? What's this?

300
00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:24.593
This is...

301
00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:26.993
A 20 dollar bill printing plate?

302
00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:28.793
Counterfeit!

303
00:17:28.793 --> 00:17:33.193
Right. He was probably asked by someone to make it.

304
00:17:33.193 --> 00:17:36.493
But it bothered him and he disappeared with the plate.

305
00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:40.193
To escape from that somebody, he hid and lived here.

306
00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:43.093
Those letters he wrote to your aunt

307
00:17:43.093 --> 00:17:46.293
were to show her his appreciation for letting him live here.

308
00:17:46.293 --> 00:17:49.193
He used the secret code because he didn't want anybody,

309
00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:52.593
other than your aunt, to know where he was.

310
00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:57.793
Then, that person who was peeking into my aunt's mailbox was...

311
00:17:57.793 --> 00:18:00.993
Yes, it's the person who order the counterfeit.

312
00:18:00.993 --> 00:18:03.893
And the person who slashed up the toys you hid

313
00:18:03.893 --> 00:18:05.093
is also the same person.

314
00:18:05.093 --> 00:18:07.093
An excellent answer.

315
00:18:10.493 --> 00:18:12.993
I thought I'd found where that guy was

316
00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:16.193
and where he hid the printing plate.

317
00:18:16.193 --> 00:18:18.393
But there were only toys in the box

318
00:18:18.393 --> 00:18:22.293
and I slashed them up.

319
00:18:22.293 --> 00:18:25.493
I heard that he was friendly with the owner of this house

320
00:18:25.493 --> 00:18:27.993
and suspected this was the place,

321
00:18:27.993 --> 00:18:31.593
but I didn't know there was a hidden room.

322
00:18:31.593 --> 00:18:33.993
Thanks, kids.

323
00:18:33.993 --> 00:18:35.593
You rat!

324
00:18:38.293 --> 00:18:42.793
Don't move! I don't want to make a murderer of myself.

325
00:18:42.793 --> 00:18:46.493
And if you make the wrong move and the bullet hits the plate,

326
00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:49.493
it won't be of any use.

327
00:18:49.493 --> 00:18:50.893
Gosh!

328
00:18:56.693 --> 00:18:59.793
Young lady.

329
00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:01.793
That's right, you.

330
00:19:01.793 --> 00:19:04.493
Get that printing plate from the old man

331
00:19:04.493 --> 00:19:07.093
and bring it over here.

332
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.993
That's it. You're a good girl.

333
00:19:14.993 --> 00:19:16.793
If you can bring it right over to me,

334
00:19:16.793 --> 00:19:19.793
I'll give you a reward.

335
00:19:25.093 --> 00:19:28.193
You brat! You want to get blown away?

336
00:19:28.193 --> 00:19:32.693
Don't panic. I'll give it to you later.

337
00:19:33.493 --> 00:19:37.393
Tomoaki Okuda.

338
00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:39.493
Why do you know my name?

339
00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:41.993
I heard it from that person a while ago.

340
00:19:43.793 --> 00:19:46.093
How can a corpse talk?

341
00:19:46.093 --> 00:19:48.793
Listen. If you listen closely, you can hear him.

342
00:19:48.793 --> 00:19:52.093
His spirit is probably still wandering around here.

343
00:19:53.593 --> 00:19:56.493
You brat! If you make anymore wise-cracks...

344
00:19:56.493 --> 00:19:59.093
Tomoaki Okuda.

345
00:20:01.893 --> 00:20:04.693
Tomoaki Okuda.

346
00:20:06.493 --> 00:20:09.193
Tomoaki Okuda.

347
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:13.893
Tomoaki Okuda.

348
00:20:17.693 --> 00:20:21.993
Well, just as promised, I'll give you this.

349
00:20:25.293 --> 00:20:26.993
Take it!

350
00:20:34.593 --> 00:20:37.093
Conan! Let's escape while we can!

351
00:20:37.093 --> 00:20:38.293
Huh?

352
00:20:38.293 --> 00:20:41.293
That's right! If that ghost appears again...

353
00:20:41.293 --> 00:20:43.593
Oh, that voice...

354
00:20:43.593 --> 00:20:45.493
It's this.

355
00:20:45.493 --> 00:20:48.193
The Yaiba Reco-changer!

356
00:20:48.193 --> 00:20:50.393
I recorded my voice

357
00:20:50.393 --> 00:20:52.493
and played it over and over again in slow.

358
00:20:53.893 --> 00:20:58.293
But how did you know that guy's name?

359
00:20:58.293 --> 00:21:02.793
It was written in secret code on that unfinished letter on the desk.

360
00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:04.593
It said, "I don't want this masterpiece

361
00:21:04.593 --> 00:21:07.693
to get in the hands of Tomoaki Okuda".

362
00:21:07.693 --> 00:21:09.393
I see.

363
00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:12.193
He wanted to leave this masterpiece in the hands of my aunt

364
00:21:12.193 --> 00:21:13.693
whom he was indebted to in the past

365
00:21:13.693 --> 00:21:15.793
so he left the secret codes in this house

366
00:21:15.793 --> 00:21:19.093
to let her know where he was.

367
00:21:19.093 --> 00:21:22.793
Hey. That aunt... what is she doing now?

368
00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:26.493
She passed away last year, at age 76.

369
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:29.093
She never got married.

370
00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:37.993
Maybe it wasn't only because he was indebted to her in the past.

371
00:23:04.993 --> 00:23:07.393
Two hours later, the police arrived

372
00:23:07.393 --> 00:23:09.593
and Tomoaki Okuda was arrested.

373
00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:12.293
We finally got to go home.

374
00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.093
But I don't understand.

375
00:23:17.093 --> 00:23:18.293
Huh?

376
00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:22.193
You know, those words that your father said...

377
00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:24.993
Dr. Agasa, you're like the sun!

378
00:23:25.693 --> 00:23:31.193
For a while after that, he called me "Dr. Sun".

379
00:23:31.193 --> 00:23:33.693
Oh, that.

380
00:23:33.693 --> 00:23:35.493
It's just a joke.

381
00:23:35.493 --> 00:23:36.993
A joke?

382
00:23:36.993 --> 00:23:40.193
Look at our name with this decoding chart.

383
00:23:40.193 --> 00:23:41.193
Huh?

384
00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:46.593
They're all suns, aren't they?

385
00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.793
I see!

386
00:23:50.693 --> 00:23:52.793
This is funny!

387
00:23:57.293 --> 00:23:59.893
I'm Dr. Sun!

388
00:24:03.593 --> 00:24:05.193
"Next Episode" -What?

389
00:24:06.293 --> 00:24:08.393
There's somebody outside!

390
00:24:13.793 --> 00:24:16.193
It's finally just us.

391
00:24:16.193 --> 00:24:18.893
Even we were being fooled,

392
00:24:18.893 --> 00:24:20.593
it's absolutely unforgivable!

393
00:24:24.193 --> 00:24:25.993
Conan!

394
00:24:25.993 --> 00:24:27.493
Run, Mitsuhiko!

395
00:24:28.693 --> 00:24:30.193
Next Conan,

396
00:24:30.193 --> 00:24:33.514
"Disappearance of the Youth Detective Squad"

397
00:24:34.095 --> 00:24:36.395
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:36.395 --> 00:24:38.895
"Number of dolls"

399
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.895
The Youth Detective Squad does a great job on the next episode too.

400
00:24:40.895 --> 00:24:42.695
Looks like Mitsuhiko will be the main character.
