1
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,607
Three?

2
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:06,807
You mean the suspects were narrowed down to three?

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,307
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:11,707
There were seven male customers who fit, but...

5
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,207
Four of them had someone with them

6
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:15,807
and when Mr. Camel came out of the restroom

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,107
and announced that someone is dead,

8
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:20,907
all four of them were either placing their orders,

9
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:22,907
or having the food that their children

10
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,707
had dropped cleaned up.

11
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:27,807
They were in some way interacting with the waitresses.

12
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:31,507
The only ones that don't have an alibi

13
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:33,407
seem to be those three that came alone

14
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:37,407
and were eating in the smoking seat area.

15
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,307
Then, let me interrogate them!

16
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,207
Don't be ridiculous!

17
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:46,507
Why would I let a high school boy like you...

18
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:49,307
The culprit could be a person from Kansai, right?

19
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,907
If so, the culprit may give himself away

20
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:54,307
if I ask him questions in the Kansai dialect.

21
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:02,607
My name's Rakutoshi Sugai.

22
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:05,407
I live in a condo in Beika Street.

23
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:08,407
And, where's your homeland?

24
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:13,507
I was born and raised in Tokyo.

25
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,107
What is this?

26
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,607
What's with this boy anyway, officer?

27
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,107
Well, don't let yourself be bothered by it

28
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:24,507
and answer his questions.

29
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:29,007
You've been sweating a lot for a while now but...

30
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,507
don't tell me you're hiding something?

31
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,907
Oh no, this is...

32
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:35,007
This curry that I ate

33
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,507
was more hot and spicy than I expected, you see.

34
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:38,007
Huh?

35
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,207
The incident occurred just about an hour ago, you know.

36
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:44,307
You should've finished eating it long before?

37
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:47,007
I just ate it!

38
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,907
Since you wouldn't let us out of here,

39
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,407
for quite some time I started getting hungry.

40
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,207
So, I ordered just a while ago.

41
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:54,207
A person is dead and I can't see

42
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,707
how they have the nerve to take the order.

43
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,007
I'm Tohru Amakasu.

44
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,207
My friends call me Ama.

45
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:08,307
I live in an apartment in Haido Street now.

46
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:11,607
And, was born and raised in Tokyo.

47
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,707
Are you satisfied now, young man from Osaka?

48
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:17,607
You seem to be sweating a lot too.

49
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:21,607
-You scared or something? -I'm not scared.

50
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,907
Cut out the nonsense.

51
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:27,607
What's with him, getting scared all of a sudden?

52
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,807
He may be more timid and shy than I expected?

53
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,607
Of all things!

54
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,507
It's just that the ramen that I ate a while ago

55
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:37,007
was so spicy hot!

56
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:38,607
Hey, you.

57
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:40,607
Rather, the way you're talking...

58
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:43,207
Huh? What's wrong?

59
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:45,107
I'm talking in ordinary Tokyo dialect, aren't I?

60
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,707
Nothing's wrong.

61
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:50,107
But, it's annoying, idiot.

62
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,707
Hot spicy ramen?

63
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,907
I'm a resident of Beika Street.

64
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,407
My name's Sanpei Tojo.

65
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:03,107
This interrogation is voluntary, isn't it?

66
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,407
Why do I have to go as far as to tell you

67
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,107
about my upbringing?

68
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:11,507
Moreover, to be asked such by a random boy...

69
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:14,707
If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to tell me anything.

70
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:16,907
But, it'll only make you look more suspicious.

71
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,907
Unlike you, I'm an Edoite of three generations.

72
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,507
Huh?

73
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:24,407
You look to be sweating a lot too?

74
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,307
Don't tell me you're going to say,

75
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,607
you're perspiring because you ate that Mabo Tofu

76
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,207
that you hardly even ate.

77
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:34,107
I'm just prone to perspire a lot!

78
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:37,907
Besides, I'm not so audacious that I can eat

79
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,307
knowing that someone just died, you see.

80
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,407
That's why I even quit eating the sweets

81
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,607
that I was planning to eat for dessert too.

82
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:47,207
Well, I think it was a good choice that you quit.

83
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,707
Since sweets will make you fat.

84
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:58,607
And, did you find anyone from Kansai among the three?

85
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,607
I wonder.

86
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,107
What do you mean, "I wonder"?

87
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,807
That's why we let you interrogate them, you know.

88
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,407
Well, I did find out that...

89
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:08,907
You found out that?

90
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:13,607
All of them ordered hot and spicy food. That's about it!

91
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:16,607
Hey.

92
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,807
No good.

93
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:23,307
Talking about food, I'm getting hungry.

94
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:25,707
Come to think of it, we haven't eaten lunch yet.

95
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,907
Then, would you like to eat too, Heiji?

96
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:31,607
The food here in this family restaurant is really delicious!

97
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,107
You mean we're racking our brains investigating this case,

98
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,707
but you guys are eating happy-go-luckily!

99
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:40,207
No, we were just starved.

100
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:43,007
Besides, we're not just eating!

101
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,907
Right, Dad?

102
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,207
Yeah.

103
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,407
We're eating the food that the three suspects ordered

104
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,507
and investigating too!

105
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:57,007
And, did you figure something out?

106
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,607
Well, that the food is good, I guess.

107
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,807
You're just merely eating.

108
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:04,707
Are those dishes really what the three ordered?

109
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:08,307
Yes! Uncle Kogoro was asking the waitress,

110
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,007
so there's no mistake about it!

111
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,607
This curry that I'm eating,

112
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:15,707
the salt flavored ramen that Uncle Kogoro is eating

113
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,307
and the Mabo Tofu that Ran is eating,

114
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:18,807
are the three dishes they ordered!

115
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:22,807
Are those three dishes really the right ones?

116
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,507
Yeah.

117
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,707
Well, to put it more accurately,

118
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,507
the two who ate curry and salted ramen,

119
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:33,507
drank coffee and ate cake before the main dish.

120
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,607
The guy who ordered Mabo Tofu

121
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:39,407
also ordered fruit for dessert, but suddenly cancelled it,

122
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,307
the waitress said.

123
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,307
I see, so that's the story.

124
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,907
If so...

125
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:50,807
I understand why he talked and acted strange.

126
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:53,807
No doubt about it! He's the culprit!

127
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:59,207
It seems he's found what he's after.

128
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:07,343
Inspector!

129
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:09,743
We just got word from Chiba

130
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,643
that they found the victim's name.

131
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:13,443
Oh, is that right?

132
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:15,943
He was hired by and working part-time

133
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,543
at a construction company in the Saitama Prefecture.

134
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,943
His name is Mr. Kengo Shibamiya.

135
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:23,043
Mr. Shibamiya seems to have been the person who first found

136
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,443
the body of the president of a construction company in Saitama,

137
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:28,043
who was poisoned to death in a case that occurred last week.

138
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,843
When Mr. Shibamiya returned from lunch

139
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,943
that he had together with his part-time colleagues,

140
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,143
he found the president who had been murdered.

141
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,943
The item used to kill the victim

142
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:36,943
was the same as what was used in this case,

143
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:40,243
a candy drop laced with hydrogen cyanide.

144
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,243
Taking into consideration that the room was not messed up at all,

145
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:45,543
but that all the money in the safe was stolen,

146
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:48,143
the Saitama Prefectural police are pursuing

147
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:51,643
personnel of the company who would've known that

148
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,543
the president liked candy drops,

149
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:56,143
and that after lunch he would return to his room

150
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,843
and count the money in the safe.

151
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:59,543
I see.

152
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,443
It's highly likely that the culprit

153
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,343
asked Mr. Shibamiya who was killed in this case,

154
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:07,343
about the president's likes and action patterns,

155
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,643
and used the knowledge to commit the crime.

156
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:12,243
By the way, it seems that the president was scheduled to meet

157
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:15,243
a man who was to be newly hired by the company that day.

158
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:18,743
If Mr. Shibamiya and the culprit are childhood friends,

159
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:22,243
then Mr. Shibamiya must've introduced them to each other.

160
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:27,243
And? Did that Mr. Shibamiya come from the Kansai area after all?

161
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,943
Yes, it seems he told his colleagues

162
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,543
he was born and raised in Osaka.

163
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,943
It seems he lied about his age saying he was in his 40s,

164
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:37,743
and his name could also be an alias.

165
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,843
In other words, the three suspects

166
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:45,243
all fall in the same age bracket, huh?

167
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,243
So, we already know that

168
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:50,543
somebody from Kansai is among the three of you!

169
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,843
If you're from Kansai, why don't you come right out

170
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,843
and identify yourself like a person from Kansai would!

171
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,443
Heiji! You're being unreasonable!

172
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,843
What're you all worked up about?

173
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,643
Why wouldn't I be all worked up?

174
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:03,343
I'm in the lead for now, you know.

175
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:06,143
In the lead?

176
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,043
I've got to solve the case fast

177
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:10,343
or he'll take the credit for this case again.

178
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:11,343
What?

179
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:14,443
You've figured out who the culprit is, Shinichi?

180
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:20,343
Yes, I got it!

181
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:23,843
I'll tell everybody that deduction!

182
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:26,143
Is that call from the detective brat?

183
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,743
Oh, yes.

184
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:30,543
Hey, give me the phone, Conan!

185
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,743
Oh, sorry. I hung up.

186
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:34,243
Geez!

187
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:37,043
And, what did Kudo tell you?

188
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,643
Oh, yes.

189
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,143
Although the three suspects all said that

190
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:44,043
they were born and raised in Tokyo,

191
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,043
he told me that there is a person

192
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,143
who is hiding that he is from Kansai,

193
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:51,243
and that this person is the culprit!

194
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:57,143
Just as would be expected of Kudo!

195
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,143
Hey! Hold it there!

196
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,143
You're from Tokyo!

197
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,743
What do you know about the people of Kansai?

198
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,343
You know it wasn't me, it was Shinichi who said that.

199
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:11,543
He said not the tables are turned and he hit a counter homerun.

200
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,043
I tell you.

201
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:15,943
He doesn't know much about baseball and yet...

202
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:17,243
Oh, that's right!

203
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:20,543
Shinichi told me to ask the person at this restaurant

204
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:23,543
to make a certain thing!

205
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,043
A certain thing?

206
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,543
Something about you'd be able to tell

207
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,743
if the person is from Kansai or not as soon as he drinks it.

208
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:32,043
It seems to be a magic dish!

209
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,843
A magic...

210
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,243
dish?

211
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:43,243
This is miso soup, isn't it?

212
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:45,243
You seriously want us to drink it?

213
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:48,743
Well, if you say you can figure out the culprit

214
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:50,743
if we drink this, I'll do so.

215
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:54,143
Drink it in one gulp as much as you can!

216
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:01,043
Oh, and I had a bowl made for everybody else

217
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:02,843
while I was at it,

218
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,943
so why don't you drink some too, Heiji?

219
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,443
What is he up to?

220
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:09,043
How does he expect to figure out who the culprit is

221
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,943
doing something like this?

222
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:17,443
"Karai"! (Salty)

223
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,043
What's with this miso soup?

224
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,443
You can say that again!

225
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:21,743
I always thought that the food in Tokyo

226
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:24,143
had strong tasting miso in them but...

227
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,343
It's just as they say,

228
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,843
I can't drink anymore of this "karai" (salty) stuff.

229
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,043
What?

230
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:35,943
Isn't it "karai" (salty) for you guys?

231
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:37,143
No.

232
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:40,243
It's true that it's a bit salty

233
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:42,643
but more than "karai"...

234
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,243
It's "shoppai" (salty), right?

235
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,943
"Shoppai"?

236
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:48,243
The people of Tokyo

237
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:51,943
refer to spicy food such as curry and Mabo Tofu

238
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,743
as "karai" (spicy hot)

239
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,443
but when it comes to salty food,

240
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:57,543
they say, "shoppai"! (Salty)

241
00:10:57,543 --> 00:11:00,243
So, Mr. Amakasu who referred to the miso soup

242
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,643
and salt tasting ramen as "karai"

243
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:04,743
is from Kansai!

244
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:08,043
What? Are you serious?

245
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,143
Then, you don't say that sea water is "karai"?

246
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:13,443
We either say it's "shiokkarai" or "shoppai".

247
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:17,043
That's just a simple error in choice of words!

248
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,943
I really wanted to say "shiokkarai"

249
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:23,243
but just happen to say what that boy from Osaka said.

250
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:26,743
Oh, and the sound you used at the end of your sentence.

251
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,343
It's ordinary Tokyo dialect

252
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,243
like you just used a while ago too, brat!

253
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:33,543
People from Tokyo don't use the phrase "Tokyo dialect"!

254
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:37,043
People from Kansai are the only ones who say that, right?

255
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,843
You don't say that, do you?

256
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,443
No.

257
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:43,843
Well, I found out for the first time

258
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,943
that putting "sa" at the end of a sentence is used in Tokyo, but...

259
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,643
I thought so too.

260
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:51,343
That it was just ordinary colloquial Japanese.

261
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,943
Well, it seems that most people from the Kanto area

262
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:57,143
say "sa" at the end of a sentence.

263
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:59,943
If you insist that I talk funny,

264
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:02,443
that man was talking funny too?

265
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:05,943
He said that he was going to eat the sweets for dessert!

266
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:09,543
But you ordered assorted fruit, didn't you?

267
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:11,443
That's not sweets!

268
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:15,043
I was referring to fruit.

269
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,343
Huh?

270
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:17,643
Oh, don't you say that?

271
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:19,843
Aren't fruit called sweets?

272
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:23,343
I don't use it, but I know what you mean.

273
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,743
At the end of the menu of high class Japanese style restaurants,

274
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:28,443
the word "sweets" is written.

275
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,543
Is that also Tokyo dialect?

276
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,543
A word from the Edo era!

277
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,343
The only ones who use it even now are the Edoites.

278
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:38,043
You said that sweets will make you fat,

279
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,043
Heiji because you thought it was candy,

280
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,343
so you don't use this word in Osaka, right?

281
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,143
That's why...

282
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,143
no matter how you look at Mr. Amakasu,

283
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:51,743
you can tell that he's from Kansai!

284
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,243
Hey, Kudo.

285
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:56,343
Besides, you seem to have been holding your cigarette

286
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,043
with you left hand, mister,

287
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,843
But, aren't you actually right-handed?

288
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:02,043
Because you put the chopsticks

289
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:05,443
you used for the ramen on your right!

290
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,543
-Hey, cut out that way of talking! -It's easy to explain

291
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:11,343
the reason for why you did all these things deliberately!

292
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,843
You were afraid

293
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,643
to hold the cigarette with the right hand

294
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,543
that you grabbed the poisoned candy drop with, right?

295
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:20,243
-Hey, it's about time... -That's enough, you!

296
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:22,543
Using that strange Kansai dialect of yours.

297
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,143
What's with you, idiot?

298
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:26,943
-Kan... -Kansai dialect!

299
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,743
Oh, well...

300
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:35,143
I just sort of copied the fighting style words

301
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:37,143
that I hear a lot on TV.

302
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:38,543
I got kind of annoyed

303
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:41,343
because this brat started talking funny all of a sudden.

304
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,943
That's right.

305
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,743
It's characteristic of the people of Kansai

306
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:45,943
to get annoyed

307
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:48,143
when hearing Kansai dialect spoken incorrectly!

308
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:50,743
Because there are rarely any Japanese people

309
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,443
who get angry at hearing people from abroad

310
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:55,443
speak funny Japanese, right?

311
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,843
And, you ordered ramen after committing the crime

312
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,543
because you wanted a wet wipe, right?

313
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,243
You knew they'd give you one right away

314
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,143
if you told them that you spilled some soup.

315
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,543
You wanted a wet wipe to wipe the poison off your hand

316
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,543
that you were planning to wash

317
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:12,443
after poisoning Mr. Shibamiya to death!

318
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:14,643
You didn't wash your hands in the restroom

319
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:16,443
because you heard running water

320
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:19,543
and noticed that someone was inside.

321
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,043
You flushed the toilet, didn't you?

322
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,943
Yeah.

323
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:24,943
I heard a man groan so I did so,

324
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:28,343
before I left the toilet to check things out.

325
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:29,843
I see.

326
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,243
So, the footsteps of the culprit walking away

327
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,243
was erased by the toilet being flushed.

328
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,943
But, why then did he hold the cigarette in his left hand

329
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,043
despite having wiped his hands with the wet wipe?

330
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,643
Maybe because he wasn't sure

331
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:42,943
if all the poison was wiped off nicely?

332
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,243
Poison is invisible besides.

333
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,243
Since the wet wipe isn't on the table,

334
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,643
you put it inside the pocket of your clothes, right?

335
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:53,543
I think if the police check that wet wipe,

336
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,643
they'll be able to figure things out.

337
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,643
They'll see that you're the one

338
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,343
who used the poisoned candy drop

339
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:02,443
and killed Mr. Shibamiya!

340
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,943
That's what Shinichi told me on the phone!

341
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,743
Hey!

342
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:14,943
Out of the way!

343
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,343
Oh, I don't think you should.

344
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:24,543
Shoots!

345
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,343
I don't think you should take her on either.

346
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,443
That girl in pony tail's pretty good.

347
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:40,543
I warned you...

348
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,843
That you shouldn't.

349
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,943
Case closed.

350
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:01,543
Oh, you're back earlier than expected, Camel.

351
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,343
Was the case solved?

352
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:04,543
Yes.

353
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,143
It seems that a man

354
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,543
poisoned a president of some company for want of money,

355
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:12,643
and since his friend was about to disclose the crime,

356
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:15,643
he called him out to the restroom to shut him up.

357
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:18,543
That seems to have been the truth of the case.

358
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:21,343
And? This person that you sent a photo taken by cell phone.

359
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:22,443
What about this teenager?

360
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,643
Seems to be a high school student

361
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:26,943
who came to the scene of the crime with Conan and the others.

362
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,943
Any recognition, Jodie?

363
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:33,543
I feel as if we've met somewhere before.

364
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,143
I wonder.

365
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:38,043
Is this kid look familiar to you, James?

366
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,343
No.

367
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:43,043
I don't remember anybody like her.

368
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,243
Her?

369
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:48,843
Yes, I thought she was a boy, but she's a girl.

370
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,843
Huh? But, it's amazing that

371
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,443
you could tell that she's a girl.

372
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:56,543
Well, I guess you could call it wisdom that comes with age?

373
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,443
I've polished my sense of things like these

374
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:00,843
through the years, you see.

375
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:04,343
This girl.

376
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,143
She resembles somebody?

377
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,643
What?

378
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:12,443
Why is it a tie?

379
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:14,443
The one who saw through who the culprit was

380
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,543
and solved the case is Shinichi, right?

381
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,943
Were they competing with each other,

382
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,443
Heiji and Kudo?

383
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:21,043
I guess so.

384
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:24,843
Well, it was Heiji who hit it off with the case,

385
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,043
because he is from Kansai.

386
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:30,043
And Shinichi, the boy from Tokyo,

387
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:33,443
used that as a foundation to get to the truth of the case.

388
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:36,143
Therefore, I think a tie is fair enough.

389
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:41,243
But I wonder if what Conan said a while ago is true?

390
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,443
About Kansai people getting angry over people

391
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:46,343
who copy their way to talking.

392
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:48,143
You'd get angry too, wouldn't you, Ran,

393
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:53,143
if I said thing like "Ano-sa" or "Ran sa"?

394
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:55,443
I wouldn't get mad.

395
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:57,643
On the contrary, I think I'd be happy.

396
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:01,443
In other words, it only goes to show that

397
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:04,143
people from Kansai are narrow-minded, after all.

398
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,943
That's not true!

399
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:08,743
Maybe it only goes to show that

400
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:12,443
the people from Kansai cherish the language that they use?

401
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,343
Yes!

402
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,443
Yes, that's right!

403
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:20,243
Oh, Ran, you used the Kansai dialect!

404
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:26,543
But that detective boy wasn't even at the crime site, so...

405
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:29,643
I guess he beat the other one?

406
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,443
Right!

407
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,643
Hey.

408
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:38,743
I'm gonna give away that you're Kudo, you know.

409
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,843
Besides!

410
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:41,343
I'm telling you that you who made that guy

411
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:44,943
use funny Kansai dialect is minus point, you idiot!

412
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:49,243
Well, I don't think overdoing it is good though.

413
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,443
And?

414
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:53,643
What'd you come to Tokyo for?

415
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:22,043
Huh? You got a letter from a dead person?

416
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,743
For Hattori?

417
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:27,443
Yeah. That person, is my mother's acquaintance.

418
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:28,943
A person named Wakamatsu

419
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:32,143
who is the president of a design company in Tokyo.

420
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,643
I've met him several times before too,

421
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:39,443
but it seems he was killed at a villa in Karuizawa.

422
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:41,143
Killed?

423
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,143
Yeah.

424
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:43,843
I had Officer Otake of the Osaka Prefectural Police

425
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,743
check on it for me.

426
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:46,943
But, it just so happened that

427
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:48,543
they were having a birthday party

428
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:51,743
for Mr. Wakamatsu's wife that day at the villa.

429
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:54,243
The local police seems to think that a robber

430
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:57,143
who broke into the villa encountered Mr. Wakamatsu,

431
00:20:57,143 --> 00:21:00,243
and as a result ended up killing him.

432
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:03,843
But, why would he send you a letter, Heiji?

433
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:07,143
Don't tell me that he sent it out before he was killed?

434
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,143
No.

435
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:12,043
That letter is post marked ten days after the crime,

436
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,243
so I don't think he's the one who sent it out.

437
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:17,443
The name of the sender is Kohei Wakamatsu but...

438
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,743
the contents of the letter seems to have been written

439
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,343
by the culprit who killed him.

440
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,643
The culprit?

441
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:26,443
Yeah. This is what is written in the letter.

442
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,143
"Dear Heiji Hattori,"

443
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:32,843
"I would like to see you, Mr. High School Detective"

444
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:36,443
"and confess the crime that I have committed."

445
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:37,843
"But, even if I were to meet you,"

446
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:40,343
"I feel slightly doubtful whether you'd be able to"

447
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,343
"visibly see me or not."

448
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,943
"Why? Because I am a warped entity"

449
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:48,143
"that you people have made up on your own."

450
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:49,943
"I'm an illusionary figure that one cannot visibly see"

451
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,843
"under normal circumstances."

452
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,643
"Despite this, if you'd still like to see me,"

453
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:55,843
"I'll be waiting for you at the residence of the man"

454
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:59,843
"that I have killed during the night of the next full moon."

455
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,443
And, at the end of the letter,

456
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:06,743
Mr. Wakamatsu's address in Osaka is written.

457
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,743
And along with...

458
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,843
the key of the house was inside too!

459
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:20,343
That was the key to unlock the door to a new case.

460
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:24,343
To open the door to a horrendous serial killing case.

461
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:28,843
-I win the battle. -So, you think...

462
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:30,243
I'm going to win it after all.

463
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:31,943
Hey...
