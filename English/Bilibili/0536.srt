1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,940
Hey.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,540
There's a spooky mansion on 3rd street, right?

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,440
You mean that abandoned house that no one lives in anymore?

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,740
Last night, I heard my mom say

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,140
some strange man came out of nowhere and started living there.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,440
What? Is that haunted house?

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,540
Since it looks so spooky, no one wants to go near it.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,940
It seems we need to scout out that house,

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,840
like the police would.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,240
It's our duty as the Youth Detective Squad!

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
Roger!

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,940
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,640
Saturday nights are for mystery.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,440
Hidden in the famous painter's masterpiece.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
What's this astonishing mystery

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,840
you think you can see but can't?

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

20
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:40,293
"The Secret of the Vanished Masterpiece"

21
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,093
It's really strange to think

22
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,693
someone would purposely move into that kind of house.

23
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:45,993
I'll say.

24
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:49,193
I'm actually more interested in the one residing in your house,

25
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:53,293
rather than whoever in this haunted house.

26
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:55,993
You mean Subaru Okiya?

27
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,193
That guy's nothing to worry about.

28
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:00,793
After all, he's a Holmes fan.

29
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:03,693
Pretty illogical, aren't you?

30
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:04,893
It's none of your business.

31
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,293
I can lend my house to whoever I want.

32
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:08,993
I suppose, but...

33
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,793
It's become pretty.

34
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,293
Looks like the one who moved in

35
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,593
took good care of the landscape, huh?

36
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:29,193
I'm telling you, you're giving me a hard time.

37
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,593
We agreed that today was the deadline, didn't we?

38
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,693
Two or three more days won't hurt.

39
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,093
But we have our own schedules.

40
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,193
At any rate, I can only give you until tomorrow.

41
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:40,293
I have my own concerns here!

42
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:42,493
Now, leave!

43
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:47,393
You can't... you had better keep your promise!

44
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:56,193
Beika Real Estate Company?

45
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:58,593
Who are you, kids?

46
00:03:58,593 --> 00:03:59,993
What do you want from me?

47
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:02,793
No, well...

48
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:06,693
Say Pops, what's with your nameplate?

49
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:07,993
Nothing's written on it.

50
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,593
It's true, there's no name.

51
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:13,193
I haven't placed a name on it yet.

52
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:15,293
I can't.

53
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:16,993
Not yet.

54
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,693
Not putting his name on the plate, it sure is weird.

55
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:24,493
Yeah, what could he be up to?

56
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:26,693
In such a huge mansion.

57
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,993
However, the next day...

58
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:31,393
What? That guy died?

59
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,293
What happened?

60
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:36,393
It seems he wasn't in good health.

61
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,493
He collapsed at home last night

62
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:41,893
and managed to call for an ambulance himself, but...

63
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,893
Although he was suspicious, I feel sorry for him.

64
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,493
That's true.

65
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:51,393
But I wonder what he was planning to do after moving into

66
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:52,793
that haunted mansion.

67
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,093
-Let's check it out. -What?

68
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,293
Our minds won't be at ease, right?

69
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,693
With an unsolved mystery lingering.

70
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,193
The neighbors say

71
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,793
they don't know much about that man.

72
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:08,993
Yeah, even though he moved in three months ago,

73
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:11,393
he didn't acquaint himself with the neighbors.

74
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,993
He seldom left the house, too!

75
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:15,793
Everyone said he would always either stay inside

76
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,693
to fix up the house or go out to take care of the yard.

77
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,193
Maybe he didn't have a job?

78
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,093
It's here.

79
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:25,893
No doubt, it's here!

80
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,693
Say, Pops.

81
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:30,193
Are you an acquaintance of the man who lived here?

82
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,993
You mean, you all knew the master, Mr. Wada?

83
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:34,193
A master?

84
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:36,593
He was a master of some kind?

85
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,793
Yes, Master Rokuro Wada

86
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:41,893
was a famous Western-style painter representing Japan!

87
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:44,593
So that guy was a painter, huh?

88
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:46,493
Then, you are, too?

89
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,993
No. I'm an art dealer that has been handling

90
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:52,293
Master Wada's masterpieces for a long time.

91
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:54,393
He said he rented this mansion to use as

92
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:57,493
an art studio for painting a new masterpiece, so...

93
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:00,493
There's no time for that, President!

94
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,993
You're right.

95
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:05,493
If someone were to steal it, it would be tragic!

96
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:11,293
Looks like this was a mystery easily solved.

97
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:12,993
About who that person was.

98
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:15,293
And what he was doing here, at least.

99
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,893
If he was painting all the time,

100
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,993
it's no wonder he never went out much.

101
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,793
But, I wonder what kind of picture he was painting.

102
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,393
We really wanna see, right?

103
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:25,593
That's true...

104
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,093
Right?

105
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:32,393
Excuse us.

106
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,193
This way!

107
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:46,893
There's nothing here.

108
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,593
It's because it was only rented as an art studio.

109
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:51,193
This house.

110
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:53,593
Huh?

111
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:56,893
Conan!

112
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:59,993
Could this boy be that man when he was a child?

113
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:02,093
Sure, looks like it.

114
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,793
What's going on, children?

115
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:04,993
No.

116
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:07,893
We just wanted to see that man's paintings.

117
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,093
The thing is, we didn't find any,

118
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,993
even after searching the other rooms and upstairs.

119
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:15,593
Could it be that someone stole them?

120
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:19,393
No, we didn't see any art supplies at all.

121
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:22,393
No easels, canvases, paint or brushes.

122
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:24,293
-What? -Are you sure this really is

123
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:25,793
his art studio?

124
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,293
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

125
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:32,893
I finally found it. The perfect place!

126
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:33,993
I'm going to create

127
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:38,493
a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece there!

128
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:41,193
Master did say that.

129
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,493
Couldn't it be that he simply put his art supplies away

130
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:46,393
-after he finished painting? -I see!

131
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:48,293
Let's give it one more careful search!

132
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:51,293
Excuse me, Mr. Wada?

133
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,793
We're about to commence the deconstruction!

134
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:55,493
What is the meaning of this?

135
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:56,993
What do you mean by what?

136
00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:00,093
This is the guy who was arguing with Mr. Wada yesterday!

137
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,093
Arguing with Master?

138
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:04,593
Where is Mr. Wada?

139
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:05,693
He passed away.

140
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,693
What?

141
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:09,093
Late last night.

142
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:11,093
Lucky.

143
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,793
Wait! What did you say?

144
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,493
Someone has died and you feel lucky?

145
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:18,293
Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:23,993
I'm Shishikura, of Beika Real Estate.

147
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:26,393
In fact, our company

148
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,993
purchased this land three months ago

149
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,493
and decided to demolish the building right away

150
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,793
for other use, but...

151
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:35,093
That's when Mr. Wada came around.

152
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:38,293
He said he wanted to rent this place for three months.

153
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:42,193
So, we agreed to rent it to him for just three months, but...

154
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:44,593
You're not leaving? What do you mean?

155
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,993
Something has come up and I've changed my plans.

156
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,093
Please give me two or three more days.

157
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:51,493
But that's causing us problems, you know!

158
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,193
We already sold this land to another customer

159
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:55,093
and agreed to demolish this house immediately!

160
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:58,093
I just need two or three days more.

161
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:01,593
That's what he said, it really put me in a pickle.

162
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:04,093
So, that's why they were fighting.

163
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:08,293
But, since he's gone, so is the problem, right?

164
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,493
All right, everyone!

165
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:12,093
Carry out his belongings and start the demolition.

166
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,393
Hold it! Please wait until we find the painting

167
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:17,193
-that Master Wada was talking about. -Oh, no.

168
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:20,293
Don't worry, we'll be quick.

169
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,493
You must be kidding.

170
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,593
What do we do now, Mr. Shishikura?

171
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:26,593
We'll just have to wait.

172
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:29,493
Let's help them find the painting as well!

173
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:32,093
Sounds like fun, just like a treasure hunt.

174
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,493
Let's, let's!

175
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:35,893
-But... -Let's go!

176
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:40,693
So, you're not going to look for it?

177
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:49,093
It's Master Wada's final masterpiece.

178
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,893
Just think of the aesthetic value!

179
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:03,193
I'd say it's futile, searching for the painting.

180
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:04,893
Futile?

181
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:10,493
Conan!

182
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:16,093
Where on earth did Master Wada put his painting?

183
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:20,393
Conan?

184
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:23,793
But, it's strange as well, this place.

185
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:24,993
If painting had been done here,

186
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:27,793
there should at least be a scent of paint.

187
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,993
But I can't smell anything like it.

188
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:32,393
Now that you mention it.

189
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:37,493
It's true just like the boy says.

190
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:41,393
Perhaps Master Wada didn't paint anything here after all.

191
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,593
No painting?

192
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,793
If that's it, the remaining mystery

193
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:48,893
revolves around why he rented the house.

194
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:52,593
Jeez, you can't even firmly refuse.

195
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:59,093
So it looks like nothing come out.

196
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:02,493
There was no painting to begin with, I suppose.

197
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:05,193
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,593
Now let's get started!

199
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:08,793
We can finally get to work!

200
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,793
Yeah, let's get this over with!

201
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:18,993
Excuse me.

202
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:21,093
Where is Mr. Wada?

203
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:24,793
He passed away last night.

204
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:26,293
What?

205
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,893
Why are you looking for Master Wada?

206
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:32,393
We received a message from Mr. Wada a few days ago.

207
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:36,293
"It'll be completed today, so please come see the painting", it said.

208
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,293
Come see the painting?

209
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,993
Master Wada actually said that?

210
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:46,593
Yes.

211
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:49,593
Four or five days ago. He mailed this.

212
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,593
Due to bad weather, it took longer than expected, but...

213
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,793
I believe, it will be completed by this weekend.

214
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:59,493
Please be sure to bring Auntie here to see it.

215
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,293
Rokuro.

216
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,393
There is no doubt. This is Master Wada's handwriting!

217
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,593
Ms. Eguchi. That's your name, isn't it?

218
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,793
Oh, yes.

219
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,793
What's Kafuen?

220
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,293
A retirement home. That's where I work.

221
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,893
What? A retirement home!

222
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:23,393
Are you Ms. Saeko Takato?

223
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,993
Do you know her?

224
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,293
As I suspected.

225
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:29,493
It's actually something I heard about from Master Wada.

226
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,893
He said he often visited your place as a child,

227
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:34,193
and an auntie of his always took care of him.

228
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:37,593
He said that the auntie is now in a retirement home.

229
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:42,293
Master Wada always took good care of me.

230
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:45,693
Ever since Ms. Takato's injury a year ago,

231
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,493
she's been suffering from amnesia.

232
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:49,893
What?

233
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:53,293
She doesn't even remember who she is anymore.

234
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,093
Amnesia.

235
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,993
I'm sorry to hear that.

236
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,193
But still, Mr. Wada

237
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:03,293
would take time out of his busy schedule to visit.

238
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:05,493
Listen, dear auntie.

239
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:10,293
I'm now working on a masterpiece I drew just for you!

240
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,693
How exciting, Ms. Takato.

241
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,393
Please do bring it here when you're done.

242
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,993
Well, it'd be impossible to bring it here.

243
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:19,693
You'll have to come by.

244
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:23,093
Does that mean it's a big project?

245
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,793
If you feast your eyes on it,

246
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,693
I'm sure you will regain your memories!

247
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,293
The gate guarding your memories will swing right open!

248
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,093
I'm certain!

249
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:35,993
That means Master Wada

250
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:38,393
actually did work on his final piece in his house!

251
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:43,793
Let's hurry and tear this house apart

252
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,593
to make up for our lost time!

253
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,569
Hold on!

254
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:02,769
Once more, let's search thoroughly!

255
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,169
Yes!

256
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,869
Hey, you two!

257
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:08,469
You couldn't find it anywhere, right?

258
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:10,369
It's nowhere?

259
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:12,769
There must be!

260
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,969
Please wait! We can't have you going in there again!

261
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:17,969
What now, Mr. Shishikura?

262
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:22,069
We wait. We can't proceed if there're people inside!

263
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,269
We have another construction site to get to!

264
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,969
Let's go grab some lunch!

265
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,569
No point arguing with a wimp like him!

266
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,869
That good for nothing.

267
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,369
And I thought we could finally get started.

268
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:39,269
Then, Ms. Takato, how about we wait here for a while?

269
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,069
Don't just stay and sit around!

270
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,469
What do you think?

271
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,069
The painting?

272
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,169
You're not going to find anything

273
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,669
because he probably didn't draw anything to begin with.

274
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,869
What? What do you mean?

275
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:57,069
Do you mean he lied to his favorite auntie

276
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:00,269
who cared for him when he was little?

277
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,369
I don't want to think that.

278
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,069
If it wasn't for working on a painting,

279
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,769
what reason did he have for renting this haunted mansion?

280
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,769
So, back to that mystery again.

281
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,769
It looks like all he did was fix the house

282
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,969
and take care of the yard.

283
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:16,769
That's right.

284
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,269
Just up ahead if I remember correctly.

285
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:22,969
Mitsuhiko?

286
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:29,969
The kids have finally gone home!

287
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:31,969
It's time for us to go.

288
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:34,069
But the painting...

289
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,769
It's bright and sunny today,

290
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,269
so let's walk slowly over to the station.

291
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:50,069
-What the heck is it? -Beika Bank.

292
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:51,869
That guy was trying to dig a tunnel

293
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,969
from that mansion to here!

294
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,469
A tunnel?

295
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:56,769
He tried to steal his way

296
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,369
into the underground deposit vault!

297
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,569
As expected, an underground tunnel.

298
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,469
From that mansion to this bank,

299
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:06,569
the direct distance is only about 50m.

300
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,569
If he were to dig 60cm a day,

301
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,869
three months would be enough!

302
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,769
He dug away during the night.

303
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:13,969
And then, during the day,

304
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,969
he would bring up the dirt and deposit it in the garden.

305
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:20,169
By doing that, he could make it appear as if he was gardening.

306
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,469
He was fixing up the house too, you know?

307
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:23,969
Merely camouflage.

308
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:26,469
It wouldn't look natural if he only worked in the yard.

309
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:29,069
-However... -Not only that.

310
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,469
Well, it'd be impossible to bring it here.

311
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:33,369
You'll have to come by.

312
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,169
If he were stealing billions of yen,

313
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,269
it sure would be impossible to carry around!

314
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,069
If you feast your eyes on it,

315
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,969
I think even you will regain your memories, Auntie!

316
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,269
There's no one out there who wouldn't be shocked

317
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,769
feasting their eyes on billions of yen!

318
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:51,469
He was referring to shocking her out of her amnesia!

319
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,169
That's what he meant!

320
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:56,169
Perfect, Mitsuhiko!

321
00:16:57,969 --> 00:17:00,769
It made my head spin.

322
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,569
Let's find the entrance to the tunnel!

323
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,069
Yes!

324
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,969
The kids are back.

325
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:09,369
So, that man went as far as to fight the real estate agent

326
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,369
in order to keep staying here.

327
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,069
Don't go in, never again.

328
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,669
This is the storage cabinet.

329
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,569
But it's not connected to the basement.

330
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,169
That means he could have torn up some of the wooden flooring

331
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:21,369
and dug under there, right?

332
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,669
So! We should go check if there's a void under the floor.

333
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,369
Not in this room, it looks like.

334
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,669
Let's try elsewhere!

335
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,969
Boy, they sure are noisy.

336
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,369
Stop making messes.

337
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,969
What?

338
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,569
At Aunt Saeko's House?

339
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,269
Could it be...

340
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:47,569
No, if I think of it this way, it all...

341
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:51,769
Chief! Something strange has come up.

342
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,169
And because of it, we couldn't...

343
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,269
All right.

344
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:02,969
Time's up! We've gotta move to the next site!

345
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,969
But, what about the demolition of this house?

346
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:09,569
Why don't you do it yourself?

347
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:14,269
Why is it always like this?

348
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:18,569
This house is to blame for everything!

349
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,769
So, this house really was...

350
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,569
I think it's where you used to live.

351
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:34,469
I wonder if I lived in such a beautiful house like this.

352
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:37,069
Since you lost your husband quite early in life,

353
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:39,469
you apparently had a pretty rough time, but...

354
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:45,969
Before that, I heard you were very wealthy and happy.

355
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:47,469
Well...

356
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:50,369
Memories from the past when she was happy...

357
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,969
So that's what it was!

358
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:03,069
I'll burn it down to ashes!

359
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,769
What the heck are you doing?

360
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:12,369
Stop doing foolish things!

361
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:15,069
What if the fire were to spread to the rest of the neighborhood?

362
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:17,769
I'm sorry. But please understand.

363
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,169
I have my reasons!

364
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:22,669
Just one more day! Wait until tomorrow.

365
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,269
Please!

366
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:37,669
What happened to him?

367
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:39,969
It seems like he's willing to wait one more day

368
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,169
to tear down the house.

369
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:44,869
It's okay to bring the house down immediately.

370
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,269
There was no painting anywhere, after all.

371
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,169
And no underground tunnels either.

372
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,969
Figures.

373
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,369
Because the reason that man rented this house was...

374
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,969
So that he could work on something for his auntie, Ms. Takato,

375
00:19:56,969 --> 00:20:00,669
a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece.

376
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,569
Did you find it?

377
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,769
It's still in progress.

378
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,269
I think it'll be completed by tomorrow.

379
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:09,769
Tomorrow?

380
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:11,469
It'll be complete?

381
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,469
Because the weather's nice today.

382
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,169
"The next day"

383
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,069
As I thought, it really is entirely complete.

384
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:30,069
What is this? It's beautiful!

385
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,669
It wasn't a painting.

386
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,669
A gorgeous sea of flower flooding around the garden.

387
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,569
This is the masterpiece Mr. Wada

388
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:45,869
had worked on for three months.

389
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:53,069
This view is the masterpiece.

390
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:57,269
Due to bad weather, it took extra time to complete.

391
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:01,469
So that's why he asked for more days.

392
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,169
Ms. Takato?

393
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:06,369
I know this place!

394
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:15,369
Flowers blooming around the garden, and swaying in the wind.

395
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,269
Over there was this mansion.

396
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:23,869
My husband stood beside me and I was always smiling.

397
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:28,269
The always cute Roku, my nephew, often came over to play.

398
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,469
Roku lost his mother when he was still young,

399
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:36,069
so he viewed me as his mother after that.

400
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,569
Ms. Takato, could it be...

401
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,069
I remember! Everything.

402
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:45,269
The gate to her memories opened?

403
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,569
So that's why it had to be here.

404
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:52,369
At this house that is very similar to auntie's house.

405
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,369
It couldn't be anywhere else.

406
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:55,969
I've got it.

407
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,769
The nameplate was meant to be his signature.

408
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,269
Signature?

409
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:05,369
That's why he didn't display his nameplate.

410
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,369
Not until the flowers bloomed.

411
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,269
Because the painting of the painter

412
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,869
is never signed until after his piece is complete.

413
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,269
That's how it is!

414
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,469
I guess it's all gone.

415
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,569
The haunted house, and the garden.

416
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,469
Such a waste, huh?

417
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:48,169
But, that man's wish finally reached his auntie,

418
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,969
-so it's all right! -You're right!

419
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,169
That's true!

420
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,169
-Well, we're gonna be late! -Yes!

421
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:56,769
Hey, hold on a second!

422
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,769
Don't leave me behind, you guys!

423
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:11,169
It's Kichiemon Samizu's safe.

424
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:24,769
This old man really likes to surround things.

425
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,469
Thief Kid?

426
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,869
Next Conan,

427
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,069
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 1)"

428
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,169
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,069
"A warning letter"
