1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,670
This man, have you seen him?

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,570
Four days ago on Tuesday night.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,170
Yes, that night, he's the perp who stole 30 million yen here in Beika.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,770
I'm sure you already know,

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,470
but two hours after the robbery,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,270
this perp Takashi Shishido died in a car accident.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,770
However, the 30 million that was stolen is missing.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,870
No good.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,870
I guess there'll be no good leads today either.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,270
Let's try over at the station.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,270
Okay.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,270
Oh, it's you.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,070
What's up, Pops?

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,970
Did a new pachinko parlor open or something?

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,270
You shrimp!

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,570
Dongaraji Temple called me!

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,170
Saying that they got a phone threat.

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,470
Dongaraji got a phone threat?

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,370
A canvas stained black with crime.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,170
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,870
The stage for today's episode is Dongaraji.

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,870
A dangerous secret is hidden in the temple grounds.

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,570
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,070
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:08,728
"The Secret Hidden At Dongaraji"

27
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:12,928
They're demanding that you stop re-construction of the temple?

28
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:17,328
Yes. The construction only started yesterday,

29
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,828
but I got the call late last night.

30
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:22,128
Hello.

31
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,128
Stop the construction immediately.

32
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,428
If you don't, you'll be cursed.

33
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:31,028
I also reported this to the police, but...

34
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:36,028
The threat of a curse isn't enough to make the police act.

35
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,328
I didn't want to risk anything happening,

36
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:40,328
so I had them cancel the construction just for a day.

37
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:45,128
And were hoping you could find whoever made the threat.

38
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:47,228
Sure thing!

39
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,528
You can count on me, Kogoro Mouri!

40
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,428
It bothers me.

41
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:54,828
I wonder what the threat to the temple is about.

42
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:57,528
Wait a minute!

43
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,028
Mother, you mean you're accusing me of lying?

44
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:02,428
How could a single person

45
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:06,328
appear at two different places at the same time?

46
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:08,928
It sounds like an interesting conversation.

47
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:12,528
Not really.

48
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:15,428
It's just that Mr. Toratani, who lives down the street,

49
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:20,328
was sitting in the sun at Central Park yesterday afternoon.

50
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,428
Like I said, I'm sure you mistook him for someone else, mother.

51
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:27,428
Because at that time, Mr. Eisaku Toratani was at West Park.

52
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:29,528
I saw with these very eyes of mine!

53
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:35,128
So, one of you mistook Mr. Eisaku Toratani for someone else, right?

54
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,528
But I didn't just see him.

55
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,828
Although it was from some distance away,

56
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,828
we both exchanged bows.

57
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,128
Me, too.

58
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,728
A single person is in two different places at the same time?

59
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:53,628
I see.

60
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:58,228
So, two men suddenly got flustered when they saw the construction start?

61
00:04:58,228 --> 00:04:59,328
Yes.

62
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:03,928
When I passed by the temple gate of Dongaraji yesterday at sundown,

63
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,628
I saw two men there.

64
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,028
You're right.

65
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,228
We got trouble. Right, bro?

66
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,128
So, they made a phone threat demanding to stop the construction.

67
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,728
It could be them.

68
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:20,128
Who on earth are those two, anyway?

69
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:23,228
They're brothers named Kinta and Ginsuke.

70
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:25,928
They're the son's of Mr. Toratani, on 2nd Street.

71
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:28,428
Over here.

72
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,628
Just what're you doing, brat?

73
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:33,728
Huh?

74
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:36,328
What brings you here, Pops?

75
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:39,128
What does a detective want with us?

76
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,528
You must have some reason for not wanting

77
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:44,828
the construction at Dongaraji to continue.

78
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:45,828
-Huh? -Huh?

79
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,628
Did you make a phone threat?

80
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:56,428
I didn't make the call either.

81
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:59,228
I'm not finished yet!

82
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,928
Is Eisaku here?

83
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:04,428
What? Why are you asking about Dad?

84
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,928
I heard a mysterious story about him.

85
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,128
Yesterday afternoon,

86
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:11,628
he was seen at the same time by a person who claims to have seen him

87
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,028
at Central Park and another who says she saw him at West Park.

88
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,128
Ginsuke, don't tell me that you...

89
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,728
You, too, Brother?

90
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:21,828
I don't know what you're talking about,

91
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,628
but I can easily confirm it, if you'd let me see him.

92
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,628
He's not home.

93
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:30,628
Our Dad is full of energy so he likes to go out.

94
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:32,728
He always goes out.

95
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,628
He always goes out?

96
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,328
Never mind about your Dad.

97
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:37,628
I want to talk to you two!

98
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,828
Making threatening phone calls is a crime, you know.

99
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:48,328
You subscribe to several different newspaper companies, don't you?

100
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:50,728
We don't subscribe newspapers.

101
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,828
That day was special.

102
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,228
Hey!

103
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,228
At any rate, we have nothing to do with Dongaraji!

104
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,228
They seem totally guilty to me.

105
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,928
Those brothers are hiding something for sure.

106
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,328
According to the neighbors,

107
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:15,328
the Toratani family and Dongaraji

108
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:17,728
don't seem to have relationships in any way.

109
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,928
Aside from the fact that they're neighbors.

110
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:23,028
But there's something a bit mysterious about that house.

111
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,928
They seem to be a family of three,

112
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,328
but nobody seems to be working.

113
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,728
Eisaku seems to be an elderly, so I understand him,

114
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,128
but when it comes to the brothers Kinta and Ginsuke,

115
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:35,028
they have no intention of working,

116
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,228
and even if they do find work, they quit right away.

117
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:42,228
I wonder how they're making a living?

118
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,428
They're probably living off Eisaku's pension.

119
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:48,328
You mean the brothers are living off their father's pension?

120
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:51,028
Talk about super lazy bums, his sons!

121
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:54,428
What are they going to do when their dad...

122
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:55,528
I got it!

123
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:59,028
Mr. Eisaku Toratani is no longer in this world!

124
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,528
What?

125
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,828
He probably died of some sudden illness,

126
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,428
but they didn't report to the authorities.

127
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,228
Because they wanted to keeps his pension coming to them.

128
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:12,228
And they probably buried his corpse somewhere on the grounds of Dongaraji!

129
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,428
But the construction started

130
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,928
and since they didn't want the corpse being dug out,

131
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:22,128
they stopped the construction.

132
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,428
That's absurd. There are no grounds for that deduction.

133
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:25,728
Wait a sec.

134
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:29,128
If he suddenly fell ill, they would call the ambulance right away

135
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,928
before thinking about the pension, right?

136
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:35,928
-Those two killed him themselves! -What?

137
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:38,828
Because he probably reprimanded them for not working or something!

138
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,428
Talk about delusion based on delusion.

139
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:48,628
But, if it's to keep everyone from finding out that Eisaku died,

140
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,028
that thing can be explained, too.

141
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,628
What do you mean by that thing?

142
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:57,828
It seems that Eisaku was always bathing himself in the sun

143
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,628
at Central Park and West Park on sunny days.

144
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,228
So, if that habit of his is not continued,

145
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,528
people would start getting suspicious.

146
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:06,028
That's why they disguised themselves as their father.

147
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,928
One of the brothers appeared here,

148
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,228
and the other brother did the same thing and appeared at West Park.

149
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:16,228
But since the brothers didn't discuss what to do ahead of time,

150
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:19,428
they ended up appearing at two places at the same time.

151
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,528
Ginsuke, don't tell me that you...

152
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,628
You, too, Brother?

153
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:28,728
If so, it explains things.

154
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:35,128
Even if you want to see Eisaku, if he's no longer in this world,

155
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:37,728
they have no choice but to say that he's out.

156
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:41,728
Our Dad is full of energy so he likes to go out.

157
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,228
He always goes out.

158
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,928
What is it this time?

159
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:52,028
I'll bet that you killed your father, didn't you?

160
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:57,228
And you buried his body on the grounds of Dongaraji and hid it

161
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,128
so that you could keep on illegally receiving his pension!

162
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:04,228
That seems to be the story, right?

163
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,128
I feel really sorry for Eisaku who had crossed over.

164
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:11,328
Hey, isn't breakfast ready yet?

165
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:12,828
Breakfast...

166
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,428
"Eisaku Toratani (70)" -Oh, you've got guests.

167
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:19,328
Thank you for looking after my sons.

168
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,128
It's Dad!

169
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,328
-That's... -That's...

170
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,728
He's not a ghost. He's got legs.

171
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,428
I thought so.

172
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,328
I always tell him not to irresponsibly suspect people,

173
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,028
but you know how kids are.

174
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,428
You saw him?

175
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:44,428
Four days ago, on Tuesday night?

176
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:47,128
Yes, I think it was near Dongaraji.

177
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:51,828
I'm glad Eisaku was fine.

178
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:53,228
It's already after noon,

179
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,728
and yet he was saying something about breakfast.

180
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:59,728
I'm sure that the two brothers are the ones who stopped the construction.

181
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:03,228
But if they didn't bury the corpse, why did they stop the construction?

182
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:05,928
If we can't figure that out...

183
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:08,328
Huh? It's Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba.

184
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:13,128
They're looking for the missing 30 million yen, right?

185
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,828
I wonder if they got information

186
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:17,228
that the perp was seen somewhere near here?

187
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:18,728
I got it!

188
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,928
They hid the cash!

189
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:22,728
Huh?

190
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:26,128
Those Kin, Gin brothers are members of a robbery group

191
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,828
and kept the money for the perp after the incident,

192
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:32,428
and hid it somewhere on the premises of Dongaraji.

193
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,428
It's not impossible.

194
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:41,628
You subscribe to several different newspaper companies, don't you?

195
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:44,128
We don't subscribe newspapers.

196
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,228
That day was special.

197
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:50,128
So, those newspapers were those of the day following the robbery.

198
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,528
They were probably concerned about how investigations were going.

199
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,428
They tried to hide it, too.

200
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:56,828
That's it!

201
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:59,628
We've got to tell Takagi and the others about it.

202
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:00,928
Hey!

203
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:17,495
Apparently, the culprit Shishido fled this way after the robbery.

204
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:20,995
And he gave the money temporarily to some other member

205
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:23,395
in order to slip through police checkpoints.

206
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:26,695
That's not possible.

207
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,695
Shishido is a man who trusts no one.

208
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:30,895
So, it's unthinkable that he'd work with anyone else.

209
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:31,995
Yes.

210
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,295
I see.

211
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,195
So, he has no accomplices.

212
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:38,695
If the phone threat case that you're pursuing,

213
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:41,095
and the 30 million yen robbery case we're after are connected,

214
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,395
but you don't always get what you want.

215
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,395
Let's try the road behind.

216
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:47,395
Yes, sir.

217
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,895
When you think about it, it's strange.

218
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,995
If they hid it somewhere here,

219
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:56,995
they don't have to do something troublesome like stop the construction.

220
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:59,495
All they have to do is retrieve the cash.

221
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,795
If they're not in this together...

222
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,695
They snatched the money away!

223
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:05,895
Huh?

224
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,495
With only their father's pension,

225
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,195
they don't have enough money to play around with.

226
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:11,695
That's why they robbed the cash!

227
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:14,795
And, they hid the cash in this temple nearby!

228
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,895
He's in delusion mode again.

229
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:21,795
What bums to rob a robber!

230
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,295
I'll get them for sure!

231
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:27,295
But I don't think those brothers have the guts to commit a robbery.

232
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:29,395
People do things you'd never imagine them doing when desperate.

233
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,295
Pops!

234
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,995
Four days ago, on Tuesday night?

235
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:39,395
Didn't you see the brothers loitering around

236
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:40,995
as if hunting for prey or something?

237
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,995
He's turning them into some kind of hideous brothers already.

238
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:47,495
You're talking about the day that Eisaku disappeared again, right?

239
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,395
He disappeared?

240
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,595
Mr. Toratani is sort of senile

241
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:55,595
and sometimes wanders around town at nights.

242
00:13:55,595 --> 00:14:00,895
His sons were looking around for him in that area that night, too.

243
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:04,895
They did it while they were searching for their father.

244
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:07,195
And hid the dough at Dongaraji!

245
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:10,095
They didn't hide it, they found it at Dongaraji.

246
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,595
-Yes. -Yes.

247
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,595
Found it?

248
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:16,095
So, they found Eisaku.

249
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:18,395
Sorry to have bothered you.

250
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:22,195
No problem. As long as he's safe.

251
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,595
He was at Dongaraji today.

252
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:30,095
The knapsack was being buried.

253
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:32,395
What're you talking about?

254
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:33,795
Burying the knapsack,

255
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:36,795
but there's nothing like that around. Right, Dad?

256
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:44,295
Burying a knapsack? Eisaku was at Dongaraji?

257
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:48,295
So those lazy no good sons had nothing to do with it to begin with.

258
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:49,795
Don't tell me that maybe...

259
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:50,995
Hey.

260
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:54,095
The father was responsible for everything!

261
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,295
I thought so.

262
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,895
That deduction of yours won't work, pops.

263
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,695
Their father did it on impulse.

264
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,495
He robbed from a robber!

265
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,395
Hey! Are you there, Dad?

266
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:13,795
If you're around, answer us.

267
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:19,395
And he buried the cash somewhere in Dongaraji.

268
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,795
But the construction started

269
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,495
and they wanted to retrieve it but couldn't for some reason.

270
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:29,095
So, they made a threat call to stop the construction!

271
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,695
If they buried and hid the cash,

272
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:34,395
they wouldn't have said anything about it to anyone, would they?

273
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:35,895
About the knapsack.

274
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:37,995
Right?

275
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,295
They blurt out things that they shouldn't.

276
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:42,795
People get that way as they age.

277
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,895
I'll turn that old man into the police!

278
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,595
Well, whatever.

279
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:56,195
No, I can't just let him go.

280
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:57,695
Think.

281
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,895
Everything we need to carry on is in our hands!

282
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:05,195
The knapsack was being buried.

283
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:07,495
Maybe it was that...

284
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:10,095
And the brothers also realized it.

285
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,495
Everything falls into place!

286
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,995
But, why did they have to disguise themselves as their father?

287
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,395
They blurt out things that they shouldn't.

288
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,195
People get that way as they age.

289
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,995
That's what they were afraid of.

290
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:28,895
I'm starting to see the picture.

291
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:30,195
The only thing left is...

292
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,395
I want to talk to your Dad!

293
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,495
It probably started from here.

294
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,695
Oh, no!

295
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,995
Mr. Mouri.

296
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,495
The perp of the phone threat

297
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:17,995
and the missing 30 million yen.

298
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,495
I, Kogoro Mouri will solve it all at once!

299
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:29,495
In both cases the person responsible is Tora...

300
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,095
Tora, tora...

301
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,495
Tiger!

302
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:39,295
Mr. Mouri!

303
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:42,395
It all happened at night four days ago.

304
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,195
Mr. Eisaku Toratani, while wandering around at night,

305
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,895
happened to witness a certain sight.

306
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:53,595
He saw a man burying and hiding a knapsack in Dongaraji.

307
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:55,395
A knapsack...

308
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:56,995
Shishido!

309
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:59,995
He hid the 30 million yen here?

310
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,495
So, he told his sons and neighbors about it.

311
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:08,695
The knapsack was being buried.

312
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:11,195
Nobody understood what he was talking about,

313
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:14,195
but his sons realized what he meant the following day.

314
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,495
So, something like this occurred nearby.

315
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:22,795
How envious, 30 million yen it says.

316
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:27,995
The thing that the perp stashed the cash inside the knapsack.

317
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:29,095
Dad!

318
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:33,795
Last night he buried this, didn't he?

319
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:36,295
That's what I said, right?

320
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,995
It seems the police haven't found it yet either!

321
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:42,495
You two obviously thought of robbing this.

322
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,495
Where was it being buried?

323
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,195
Where in Dongaraji?

324
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,595
Where was it, now?

325
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,995
We'll just wait until he remembers.

326
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,495
His memory comes and goes.

327
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,995
But, if we let it go as it is...

328
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:59,595
You two were worried about a certain thing.

329
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:04,595
If Eisaku tells anyone that he witnessed a knapsack being buried,

330
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:07,695
it may reach the ears of the police, too.

331
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:08,995
Since you don't want this to happen,

332
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:10,895
to keep him from meeting anyone,

333
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:13,695
you confined Eisaku inside the house.

334
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,895
You confined your father?

335
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:19,395
All we did was keep him from going outside, right?

336
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:21,695
We didn't tie him up or anything!

337
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,695
You appeared in the park as Eisaku,

338
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,495
so people wouldn't think you were confining him.

339
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:30,695
Although it's amusing that you ended up in two places at the same time.

340
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,995
But despite all your efforts,

341
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,495
the construction of Dongaraji started,

342
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:39,095
and your treasure was in danger of being dug up.

343
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,095
Stop the construction right away.

344
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:43,895
If you don't, you'll be cursed.

345
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:45,795
Talk about poisoned with worldly passions!

346
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:51,295
Just as you thought, the two cases were connected after all.

347
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,195
And, where is the main...

348
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,895
I wonder where the knapsack is buried?

349
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,195
Where is it?

350
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,095
-I guess so. -I guess so.

351
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:06,095
The perp Shishido, trying to avoid the hands of the police, fled in here.

352
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,895
Then, hit upon the idea of hiding the cash he robbed here.

353
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:14,195
Most naturally in a place where he wouldn't be witnessed by anyone.

354
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:19,095
Not seen by anyone?

355
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:22,495
This means that Eisaku wouldn't have been able to see it either.

356
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:25,195
-Right? -Right?

357
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:28,495
Shishido thought that if here, no one would witness him,

358
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:31,495
but Eisaku witnessed it.

359
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:35,095
There is only one such place.

360
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,695
Behind that gingko tree!

361
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,295
But if behind the tree, Eisaku wouldn't be able to witness it either?

362
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,695
That night, when Eisaku wandered off,

363
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:47,895
he didn't come directly here to Dongaraji.

364
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:48,895
Which means?

365
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:50,195
-Then, where was he? -Then, where was he?

366
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,095
I think that even Shishido wouldn't have thought

367
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:58,995
that someone would be up on the roof that late at night.

368
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,795
Hey, Dad! Are you there?

369
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:14,595
There he is, bro!

370
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:17,095
Don't worry us, Dad!

371
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:19,695
The knapsack was being buried.

372
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,395
Huh?

373
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:22,395
Let's go home.

374
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:24,995
Come to think of it,

375
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:29,595
he used to say that the sunset viewed from there is spectacular.

376
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:31,095
He used to go up there a lot

377
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,295
so maybe he wandered up there that night, too.

378
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,195
-There it is! -There it is!

379
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:43,895
That's right. It's over here.

380
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,095
Don't remember after you see it.

381
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:47,195
That's right.

382
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:49,495
Enough! You no good sons!

383
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,495
It's true.

384
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:23,995
The priest told them that he'll overlook the phone threat thing

385
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:25,495
if they work here.

386
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:36,595
I tell you to shape up!

387
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:43,395
Anyway, Eisaku looks happy.

388
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:47,095
Hey, come on. Pull yourself together.

389
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,395
Talk for yourself.

390
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:57,095
"Next Episode" -Get a hold of yourself, Dad.

391
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,395
Ai.

392
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,495
Okay! I'll do it!

393
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,595
They're here. Both of them.

394
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:12,395
Shall I have him come over here when he gets back?

395
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:14,295
Please do that.

396
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,295
Yoko!

397
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:18,295
Asuka!

398
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,495
Next Conan,

399
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:24,295
"The Suspects Are Passionate Lovers (Part 1)"

400
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,938
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:29,338
"Higo And Yoko"

402
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:31,438
Is the "passionate couple" supposed to be Higo and Yoko Okino?

403
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,938
Yoko!
