1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,980
Smells good.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,980
How's this coming along?

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,240
It's delicious.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,240
All that's left is to add
the secret ingredient.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,200
Let's see. Pork, potatoes.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,920
Carrots, onions.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,100
Daikon radish?

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,790
Burdock root.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,300
Burdock root? In curry?

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,860
Like daikon radish, it's a root vegetable.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,660
It's got good texture and tastes good, too.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,430
I see.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,810
Chicken, beef, seafood.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,690
Enoki mushrooms and spinach.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,980
And finally, plenty of love.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,690
Sounds like it'd give you heartburn.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,360
Masuoka Susumu (38)

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,960
Masuoka Susumu (38)
That's right. I'm absolutely certain.

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,500
I did it for Erina.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,540
No, Shohei-san did nothing wrong.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,540
Please calm down. Tell us what happened.

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,630
Excuse me, Inspector Megure.

23
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,080
Mori-kun, when did you get here?

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,230
Wherever there's a case,
Mori Kogoro is there.

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,270
By the way, Inspector, what do
you like to put in your curry?

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,020
Mori-kun, is this really the
time to be asking that question?

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,150
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,480
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,170
A man protects his beloved wife!

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,160
What is the secret ingredient
that changes the case?

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
Always determining the one truth

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,500
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,580
his name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,610
The Man Who Loved Too Much

35
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,830
The Man Who Loved Too Much
"The Man Who Loved Too Much!"

36
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,980
The Man Who Loved Too Much

37
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,230
Let's review what happened.

38
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,740
This afternoon you went to the department
store to buy a birthday present for Erina-san.

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,990
When you returned, you noticed that
the window by the entrance was broken.

40
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,200
You quietly entered the house
and looked in the living room,

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,040
You quietly entered the house
and looked in the living room,
Sakuragawa Shohei (30)
Erina's Husband

42
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,010
You quietly entered the house
and looked in the living room,

43
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,180
where you saw the dead
man ransacking the room.

44
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,540
A burglar, huh?

45
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,010
The man noticed you, raised his
knife, and came towards Erina-san.

46
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,680
The man noticed you, raised his
knife, and came towards Erina-san.
Sakuragawa Erina (28)
Housewife

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,180
Sakuragawa Erina (28)
Housewife

48
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,690
However, Shohei-san fought back using a
golf club that was in the living room.

49
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,820
When the burglar fell, he hit his
head on that object and died.

50
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,790
Th-That's right... It... It was me.

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,450
But Shohei-san was preoccupied
with protecting me.

52
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,360
We identified the dead man
by checking his phone.

53
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,830
Masuoka Susumu, 38 years old.

54
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,210
He previously committed forcible
entry and theft on three occasions,

55
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,530
and had a criminal record.

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,460
So he had previous offenses, huh?

57
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,840
By the way, did that bag
belong to the dead man?

58
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,600
Th-That jewelry is mine.

59
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,090
That matches their statement.

60
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,230
Yeah. This is a tragedy that occurred when
a husband tried to protect his beloved wife.

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Certainly seems that way.

62
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,120
Make sure you're honest when you testify
to the police or at the courthouse.

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,390
As long as they recognize Shohei-san's
pure and noble love for Erina-san,

64
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm sure everything will be fine.

65
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,930
And then repent for your crimes accordingly.

66
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,550
Right, Inspector?

67
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,630
Looks like you won't have to
do any sleeping this time.

68
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,010
Thank you!

69
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,640
But there are a few other
things I'd like to confirm.

70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,220
But there are a few other
things I'd like to confirm.
Let's go, kid. We've got shopping to do.

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,190
Let's go, kid. We've got shopping to do.
I'd like to speak with you a little more.

72
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,110
I'd like to speak with you a little more.
Okay.

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,900
Tomatoes, avocados.

74
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,330
Why don't we go all the way
and make goya champuru?

75
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,110
I don't know about champuru,
but goya curry sounds pretty good.

76
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,410
Is this...

77
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,550
A birthday card?

78
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,160
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,030
What's this doing here?

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,070
What are you doing? Let's go.

81
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,950
I'm going to use their bathroom. Hold on.

82
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,930
Jeez.

83
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,190
There's only one pair of shoes.

84
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,530
The golf bag is back here?

85
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,100
Yes, that's right.

86
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,700
Erina and I entered through this entrance.

87
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,250
No, he entered through the back
door alone and grabbed a golf club.

88
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,880
Huh? Conan-kun?

89
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,750
Sorry, but I was hoping to use your bathroom.

90
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,840
Go ahead.

91
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,130
Thanks.

92
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
Hey, Erina-san.

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,420
What is it?

94
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,700
That shelf behind you is
full of photos of you.

95
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,200
My husband takes pictures of me practically
every day and puts them on display.

96
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Shohei-san must really love you.

97
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,580
Yes.

98
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,890
He tells me he loves me every day
and is completely devoted to me.

99
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,370
Even though I've never
told him that I love him,

100
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,220
he loves me more than anything.

101
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,960
But it's not right.

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,890
Erina-san, are you okay?

103
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,350
Watch your step.

104
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,480
That's my precious collection.

105
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,980
They're all European.
They're valuable and expensive.

106
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,610
Sorry. But it's a good thing none of
your photos or teacups were broken.

107
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,080
You're right. Lucky us.

108
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,250
Erina-san, could I speak with you?

109
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,000
Coming!

110
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,380
The rest of the house was
thoroughly ransacked,

111
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,300
but their valuables are undamaged.

112
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,370
It can't be a coincidence.

113
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,910
Just this spot...

114
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,910
That chair was knocked over, too.

115
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,980
Was the culprit sitting in this chair?

116
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,660
But why would a burglar sit in a chair?

117
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,410
Huh?

118
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,410
Only that section of the
wall is a different color.

119
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,420
Was the calendar moved?

120
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,540
What's this doing here?

121
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,460
What's this dent?

122
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,470
Was this calendar moved to hide this?

123
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,500
This was no ordinary burglary.

124
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,790
They lied about everything.

125
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,010
Something must have happened.

126
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,000
What happened here?

127
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,890
I knew you were taking too long.

128
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,220
You shouldn't be wandering around back here.

129
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,700
Come on, we're leaving.

130
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,210
Mori-kun, you're still
here? I thought you left.

131
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,990
Sorry. We'll be leaving right away.

132
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,580
Please do.

133
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,700
Yes, sir. Come on, let's go.

134
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,550
Let go, Mister. They've got curry.

135
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,500
Curry?

136
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,590
Hey, you're right.

137
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,090
I detect the delicious smell of curry.

138
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,530
That smells great. Is that tonight's dinner?

139
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,100
Yes.

140
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,850
We're making curry today, too.

141
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,130
You two are going to cook?

142
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,840
Yes.

143
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,610
Normally Ran handles all the cooking,
so we thought we'd surprise her today.

144
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,360
We've been thinking about how
we can make a tasty curry.

145
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,280
Do you have any secrets
to making a tasty curry?

146
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,740
If you do, I'd appreciate
it if you could tell us.

147
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,490
Well, uh...

148
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,350
Why don't you tell them, Erina?

149
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,870
What?

150
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,870
About your secret ingredient.

151
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,630
Secret ingredient?

152
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,320
My Erina's curry is always
exceptionally good.

153
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,260
Not even I know what the
secret ingredient is.

154
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,260
It's so good, I could eat it every
day and never get sick of it.

155
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,760
Right, Erina?

156
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,760
Uh, yeah.

157
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,250
What's the secret ingredient?

158
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,010
Could you tell us?

159
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,540
Uh, the secret ingredient
I put in my curry...

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,510
...is love.

161
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,140
I think about my beloved
husband while I cook.

162
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,170
Hey, Erina-san. Can I try that curry?

163
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,980
No!

164
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,420
I-I'm sorry. I'm not confident
in my cooking today.

165
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,570
Hey, kid. Show some restraint.

166
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,930
Er, sorry about that. Truly.

167
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,980
What did they burn?

168
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,560
It was probably that.

169
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,910
What's this?

170
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,620
Enough, kid.

171
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,260
Mister, look at this.

172
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,870
There's something written on this notepad.

173
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,380
What's this?

174
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,840
"I love you. I truly love you."

175
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,250
What is this?

176
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,380
I wrote that.

177
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,920
You did?

178
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,640
Yes. Go ahead and read the rest.

179
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,300
The rest?

180
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,270
"So let's go to Lake Yamanaka today."

181
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,940
I planned on taking her there
as a birthday surprise.

182
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,790
But I was too embarrassed
to tell her directly,

183
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,280
so I'd been practicing
by writing it on that paper.

184
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,780
Lake Yamanaka is a famous tourist spot.

185
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,790
But, Shohei-san, don't you tell Erina-san
that you love her every day?

186
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,540
I don't see why you'd need to practice.

187
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,520
No, Shohei-san wrote this.

188
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,290
Shohei-san is the only person who
would write that he loves Erina-san.

189
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,550
Shohei-san is the only person who
would write that he loves Erina-san.
I love you. I truly love you,
so let's go to Lake Yamanaka today.
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei

190
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,610
No, this isn't Shohei-san's handwriting.

191
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,430
Does that mean Masuoka wrote this?

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,340
Was it Erina-san who was sitting
across from Masuoka-san?

193
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,940
Not only that, but they were alone together.

194
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,180
I love you?

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,450
The culprit died when he hit
his head on that, right?

196
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,270
So, what?

197
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,830
Isn't that a boat weight?

198
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
A boat weight?

199
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,460
Yeah, look. It says 3 kilograms on it.

200
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,530
Shohei-san and Erina-san, why
is this in your living room?

201
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,090
Because I—

202
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,890
You bought it?

203
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,850
Ah, you must have a boat.

204
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,220
Yes, I was thinking about buying a boat.

205
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,480
These are rope fibers.

206
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,610
Could the culprit have brought this here?

207
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,990
What? The culprit brought it? Uh...

208
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,250
I, um...

209
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Shohei-san, I'm sorry,

210
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,310
but could you and Erina-san come down to the
station and tell us more about the case?

211
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,430
Honey, you need to take your medicine first.

212
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,100
My medicine?

213
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,510
That's right. You need to take it right away.

214
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,230
He has a chronic disease.
His medicine is in the bedroom.

215
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,590
Come on, quickly.

216
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,650
You nearly told them the truth, didn't you?

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,030
No, I just...

218
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,530
Keep it together.

219
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,160
Sorry. I'll be careful.

220
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,940
It's true. I'd do anything for you, Erina.

221
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,290
I love you. I love you, okay?

222
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,800
I hate this about you.

223
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,670
I wish you'd disappear and leave me alone.

224
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,180
That's why I asked him to do that.

225
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,820
Asked him to do that? Disappear?

226
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,060
Crap!

227
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,990
Ow!

228
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,600
There you are. We're getting out of here.

229
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,690
We're going shopping.

230
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,610
Inspector, sorry for staying so long.

231
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,230
Hey, you brat! You'd better
wait for me in the entryway.

232
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,080
Excuse us. We should get going.

233
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,150
Take care.

234
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,350
Thank you. Excuse us.

235
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,020
We're leaving!

236
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,620
Leaving...

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,690
Leaving...

238
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,160
A-Are you all right?

239
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,720
What is it, Mori-kun?

240
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,350
We'll be leaving after I solve this case.

241
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,880
What did you say?

242
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,520
It's already clear what happened.

243
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,360
Shohei-san acted in self-defense
while protecting Erina-san.

244
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,670
Self-defense.

245
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,230
It certainly looks that way.

246
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,540
But Shohei-san and Erina-san
lied about the entire case.

247
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,870
The two of them are fooling us.

248
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,430
They lied?

249
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,380
They're fooling us?
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,380
I found something.

251
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,610
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei

252
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,750
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei
On my way here,

253
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,880
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei
I found a birthday card for
Erina-san by the entryway,

254
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,640
as well as Shohei-san's footprints
leading to the back door.

255
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,520
Shohei-san, you left alone and
returned alone through the back door.

256
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,520
You've got mud from around the back
door on the hem of your pants.

257
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,910
Alone? Where was Erina-san then?

258
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,040
She was meeting with
Masuoka inside this house.

259
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,210
With Masuoka? Hold on, why
would she be meeting him?

260
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,210
Because Masuoka wasn't a burglar.

261
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,210
What? Who was he, then?

262
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,790
Just listen.

263
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,220
Masuoka probably told Erina-san
to invite Shohei-san on a trip.

264
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,900
At their destination,
he'd kill him using a knife,

265
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,400
use ropes to tie a weight to him,
and submerge him in the lake.

266
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,710
But Erina-san had a problem.

267
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,980
She didn't know how to invite
Shohei-san on a trip.

268
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,810
After all, she'd never
told him she loved him.

269
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,490
I've never told him that I love him.

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,950
Masuoka had Erina-san
practice by writing a note.

271
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,500
That was the note we found.

272
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:43,700
I love you. I truly love you,
so let's go to Lake Yamanaka today.
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei

273
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,500
I love you. I truly love you,
so let's go to Lake Yamanaka today.
Keep on being a beautiful lady
Shohei
"I love you. I truly love you."

274
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,970
That's when tragedy struck.

275
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,500
Shohei-san came home.

276
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,010
He mistook their meeting for an affair.

277
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,020
An affair?

278
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,510
I-It was a misunderstanding?

279
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,180
That's it.

280
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,430
Pour your heart into your writing.

281
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,570
Pour my heart into it...

282
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,320
That's right, ma'am. "I love you."

283
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,340
Okay.

284
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,690
"I love you."

285
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,690
Erina loves that man?

286
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,970
Then Shohei-san's rage was
directed towards Erina-san.

287
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,090
You were cheating on me with this guy, Erina?

288
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,640
But I love you so much.

289
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,660
This can't be true, Erina.

290
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,820
You're married to me, but
you've been seeing that guy?!

291
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,480
There's a dent hidden beneath
the calendar behind me.

292
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,450
You can check it later.

293
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,330
Mori-kun, hold on. I don't understand.

294
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,680
Invite? Kill? Submerge?

295
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,600
What are you talking about?

296
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,340
What did Erina-san ask Masuoka to do?

297
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,440
While looking for Conan,

298
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,600
I happened to overhear them
speaking in the bedroom.

299
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,470
I wish you'd disappear and leave me alone.

300
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,980
That's why I asked him to do that.

301
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,480
"Asked him to do that"?

302
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,480
"I wish you'd disappear"?

303
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,990
Erina-san asked Masuoka to kill Shohei-san.

304
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,010
Kill Shohei-san?

305
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,910
Sh-She put a hit on him?

306
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,540
N-No! I didn't do it.

307
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,170
Detective Takagi, could you
check inside the curry?

308
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,040
What's this?

309
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,700
Erina-san, is this the secret ingredient
you included for Shohei-san?

310
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,040
Erina-san intended to use that money
to pay Masuoka for Shohei-san's murder.

311
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,310
She invited Masuoka here
while Shohei-san was out.

312
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,060
Y-You're wrong.

313
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,070
There's blood on those bills.
It's probably Masuoka's.

314
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,450
And if thoroughly examined, Erina-san's
fingerprints may turn up, too.

315
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,330
After Masuoka was killed,

316
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,340
there was still a mountain of evidence
left of the hit on Shohei-san.

317
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,650
Erina-san couldn't fool Shohei-san.

318
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,460
So she convinced him to lie instead.

319
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,820
I'm sorry, Erina.

320
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,450
What should I do?

321
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,240
If the police find out that I tried
to have you killed, I'll be ruined.

322
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
Erina, what should I do?

323
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,960
Fool them.

324
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,610
What?

325
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,490
If you love me more than anyone,

326
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,670
Lie for me.

327
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,490
It's not my fault.

328
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,620
That's right! It's not her fault!

329
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,510
It's all my fault.

330
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,610
It's my fault that I couldn't
become Erina's ideal husband.

331
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,630
Because I couldn't die for her.

332
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,010
Because I couldn't keep her secret.

333
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,580
It's not Erina's fault.

334
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,480
Right, Erina?

335
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,880
My Erina?

336
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,030
You creep.

337
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,020
This tastes really good.

338
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,080
You're not such a bad cook when you try.

339
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
Right? The word impossible
is not in my dictionary.

340
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,280
Mori Detective Agency

341
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,810
Mori Detective Agency
The final secret ingredient
is a pinch of salt.

342
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,950
Mori Detective Agency
It's salty now.

343
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,480
Mori Detective Agency
What? Then we'll add some sugar cubes.

344
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,450
Mori Detective Agency
Now it's too sweet.

345
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,500
Mori Detective Agency
Ponzu, then.

346
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,970
Mori Detective Agency
How about yakiniku sauce?

347
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,420
Mori Detective Agency
