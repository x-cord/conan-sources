1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,840
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,240
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,840
Great adventure at the mansion of tricks.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,540
Surprising tricks that are dangerous enough to take lives.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,640
Youth Detective Squad, outfox that snobbish guy!

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,525
I figured out the mail address of the boss of the Black Organization

10
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:01,925
from the melody of the "Seven Baby Crows".

11
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,225
But I decided not to pursue any further

12
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,625
after Haibara gives me a piece of her mind.

13
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:08,725
In the meantime,

14
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:12,325
Genta and the others found a strange stone box.

15
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:17,325
And there, they find a code having to do with the Big Jewel,

16
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:21,725
as well as a strangled corpse beside it.

17
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,325
And in its hand brimming with stones.

18
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,125
Hey, Conan.

19
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,125
What is it? Tell us what follows.

20
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:37,925
Its hand brimming with...

21
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,825
the Big Jewel!

22
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,325
No doubt about it.

23
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:02,725
"Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Tricks"

24
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,225
I see.

25
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:12,425
I guess this is the start of diamond cut diamond.

26
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,625
What's that?

27
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,825
It's a proverb of Belgium.

28
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:21,625
In order to cut hard diamond, another diamond has to be used, right?

29
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,125
Therefore, it refers to the start of a composed yet vicious battle

30
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,325
between the sages and the strong men.

31
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,725
But who's battling against who?

32
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:36,525
Idiot.

33
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:40,125
Neither he nor I is something as great as a diamond.

34
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:46,325
He's just a thief who hides the truth under a veil and enjoys it.

35
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:52,425
And I'm just a detective who's dying to tear off that veil.

36
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:59,425
And? Just who is that thief?

37
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:04,125
Are you talking about the partner of the man who was sunk into the swamp?

38
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:09,625
A snobby evil thief who only goes after large gems like Big Jewel,

39
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,025
called Thief Kid.

40
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:15,925
Thief Kid...

41
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,125
Yes.

42
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,325
I know that name.

43
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,825
Elusive and daring.

44
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:25,425
Gentleman thief.

45
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,625
Doc has told me

46
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,825
about your battles.

47
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,425
Our battles?

48
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:35,425
It seems that you've been outfoxed quite a few times?

49
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,825
It's not that he outfoxed me or anything.

50
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,825
Because he's never stole any treasure from me yet.

51
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:43,125
Is Thief Kid here?

52
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,025
It's just my guess.

53
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,925
It was written in the man's notebook, right?

54
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:53,525
"So now I can outfox that petty thief that puts on airs."

55
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:58,325
That petty thief that he was referring to is probably Thief Kid.

56
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,425
Then are you saying the one that killed that man...

57
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,525
Was Thief Kid?

58
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:04,825
Beats me.

59
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:09,125
Rumour has it that he never takes a person's life though.

60
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,525
But it's for sure that Thief Kid as well as the one who killed that man

61
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,825
is still around here somewhere.

62
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,325
Right,

63
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:18,725
if the treasure hasn't been found yet.

64
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,525
It's most likely that it's inside this mansion.

65
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:31,825
Well, it's started to rain.

66
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:35,625
So let's take shelter from the rain and take a look inside.

67
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,625
Then...

68
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,025
We're going to start...

69
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:40,425
Treasure hunting, right?

70
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,425
Don't get me wrong.

71
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,825
It's only until Doc calls the police and they get here, understand?

72
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,625
All right...

73
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:25,425
But now that we're going inside, it sure is a creepy mansion.

74
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:28,725
Are you sure there's treasure in here?

75
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:32,525
I'm sure it's hidden somewhere in here.

76
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,925
It bothered me a while ago, but...

77
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:38,025
The brand new traces of wet mud on the border of the wall

78
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:40,725
and the floor of the mansion.

79
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,625
Moreover, throughout the mansion there is...

80
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,225
I wonder why?

81
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:46,725
Hey, Conan!

82
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:50,625
Explain the meaning of the writing one more time!

83
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,525
The meaning of the writing that was written inside the stone lantern.

84
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,725
Oh, that...

85
00:06:56,725 --> 00:07:00,125
The God Nioh is not around, right?

86
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,525
Right.

87
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:04,725
The resting place of the God Nioh is near the sun,

88
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,425
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

89
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,725
That is where the God Nioh stone is.

90
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,425
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

91
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:16,525
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

92
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:19,425
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

93
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,625
Kichiemon Samizu.

94
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,425
In other words,

95
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:27,125
the God Nioh sleep in a place closest to the sun

96
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,625
and where the elders gather, in a very lively place.

97
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,525
That's where the stone of the God Nioh is.

98
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:36,425
In other words, the place where the diamond is hidden, right?

99
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:39,825
But the point is the words that follows.

100
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,525
Yes, that's right.

101
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,825
Conan went on to explain it part way and became silent,

102
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,525
so we still don't understand it.

103
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,525
Those who do not fear the rage of the God Nioh,

104
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:51,925
get a hold of the stones that are brimming out of its hand

105
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:54,625
and learn from the proverb of long ago.

106
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,325
What does that mean?

107
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,425
The God Nioh is going to get angry after all.

108
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:01,525
Right.

109
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:04,825
And the comma-shaped bead made of stone with the word fire carved onto it

110
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,025
that was hidden in the hem of the dead body that was found a while ago.

111
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:13,925
I have no idea what this has to do with the code.

112
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,725
Hey, let's go inside already.

113
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:18,625
Hold your horses.

114
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,525
Isn't there anything else written in that man's notebook?

115
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,625
There is,

116
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,025
but since it's wet I think we should wait until it dries.

117
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,125
Otherwise it'll rip and become unreadable.

118
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,425
We don't have all day, you know.

119
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,225
Hey, Genta!

120
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,325
Genta!

121
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,325
Don't go inside carelessly.

122
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,725
The puppet maker Kichiemon built this mansion, you know.

123
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,025
The diamond is in a place nearest to the sun, right?

124
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,125
-If so, then I'm sure it's hidden... -Hey, Genta!

125
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,925
at the top most part of the house!

126
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:05,725
At any rate, let's go to the very top.

127
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,425
Hold it, Genta!

128
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:13,725
One step at a time. It's gonna be alright.

129
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:14,925
What?

130
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:21,625
Genta!

131
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,325
-Genta! -Genta!

132
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,725
Huh?

133
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,625
What's with you kids?

134
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,125
Genta, are you all right?

135
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:51,125
Are you guys looking for Kichiemon's treasure, too?

136
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,625
No.

137
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,925
Well, who cares?

138
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:56,225
You'd better be really careful though.

139
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:59,025
This step is a trap!

140
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,925
If you want to go up, you have to go on farther beyond.

141
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:10,325
Puppet maker Kichiemon is quite a sourpuss, you know.

142
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:15,325
If you move just according to what you see, you'll get hurt.

143
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,825
By the way, didn't you guys found an odd looking stone?

144
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,525
As to that...

145
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,825
We didn't found anything!

146
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:25,625
Oh, really?

147
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,325
Tell me if you found it then, okay?

148
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,225
Okay, sure!

149
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,325
Hey, Conan.

150
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,725
Why are you lying?

151
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:37,625
He's a good man who saved Genta, you know?

152
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:41,625
You never know if he's a good man.

153
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,725
He could acting friendly just so he can take away the stone.

154
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:51,625
Yes. If that guy is Thief Kid the more so.

155
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,925
He could even be the guy who killed the body that was found a while ago.

156
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:00,225
But it seems that we'd be safer staying close to the guy

157
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:03,025
because he seems to know a lot about the traps inside this mansion.

158
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:06,525
Also so that he doesn't get away till the police get here.

159
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:10,925
I wonder if Doc got hold of the police already?

160
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,425
Is it still farther away?

161
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,125
That dilapidated mansion?

162
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,225
Well...

163
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:24,225
It's hard to find it in the dark.

164
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,525
Now, which way was it?

165
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,425
Come on.

166
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,625
Oh, carps!

167
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,025
There are a lot of them.

168
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:40,625
This place is like a high class Japanese restaurant

169
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,925
with the river flowing throughout the house.

170
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:46,225
I wonder if it's connected to the swamp outside.

171
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,725
Look.

172
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,325
There's even a bridge.

173
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,725
All right.

174
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:02,125
A pitfall?

175
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:11,725
I'm not going to fall for the same trick this time.

176
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:14,025
No, it looks like a pitfall but it's actually...

177
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,025
Amazing!

178
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,025
It's just like an elevator.

179
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:47,325
Conan.

180
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,125
Get on quickly.

181
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:57,925
In other words, if we try to go up, we end up going down.

182
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:01,625
And if we try to go down, we go up, right?

183
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,825
Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple.

184
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,025
Yes!

185
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,125
Here we are.

186
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,625
It was simple, wasn't it?

187
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,425
How silly.

188
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,625
If it were that easy,

189
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,325
we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of looking for it.

190
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:27,125
Isn't it right, treasure hunter with kids?

191
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,425
These kids are not with me.

192
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:37,125
And I don't think you should be using knives around kids.

193
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,825
Take a good look at the tip of the knife.

194
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,725
Poison spider?

195
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,625
Kichiemon was not only a sourpuss

196
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,525
but he seems to have been quite mean, too.

197
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,725
If you want to go to the very top, it's this way.

198
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:55,425
Hey, could she be Thief Kid?

199
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,525
I thought Thief Kid was a boy.

200
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:00,725
I've heard that he disguises himself as a woman, too.

201
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,825
Right, kids. Be careful now.

202
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,925
The spider could still be around somewhere, you know.

203
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:16,125
Wait for me!

204
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,525
Conan, hurry up and come.

205
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:26,125
You're going to get bitten by the poison spider!

206
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,725
I'm coming!

207
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,525
Hey, look!

208
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:38,025
It seems like we've reached the top.

209
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,525
But there's nothing here.

210
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:42,725
Does it mean it's on the roof?

211
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:46,125
In order to climb up on the roof...

212
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,425
Strange.

213
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,625
How come there are no thick pillars on this floor?

214
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,525
Here it is. A ladder!

215
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:58,125
There were thick pillars on the floors below.

216
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,925
Okay! We're going to be the first ones to get there.

217
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:02,625
Wait a second.

218
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,825
If the big pillar were to be hollow...

219
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,125
No! That's a trap!

220
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:15,825
Hey!

221
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:16,825
Shoots!

222
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,025
Genta! Ayumi!

223
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,925
Mitsuhiko! Haibara!

224
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,689
Hey, are you all right?

225
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:09,289
I'll send a rope down right now!

226
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:10,989
Remember, we were saying,

227
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:14,489
if you try to go up, you'll fall down.

228
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:18,189
Not again.

229
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,189
Are you guys all right?

230
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:29,689
-Yes. -Yes.

231
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:30,689
Yes.

232
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,089
We somehow got down safely,

233
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,589
but we're down at the very bottom, aren't we?

234
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,789
We were supposed to go to the top.

235
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:44,689
I checked on top the roof, but there was nothing there.

236
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,889
Really?

237
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,189
You were probably right to come down here.

238
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:51,189
It hurts.

239
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:54,189
What?

240
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,789
Skulls!

241
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,289
Hey, Conan!

242
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,489
Hey, this place is full of skulls!

243
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:06,489
What?

244
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:11,589
From the looks of their outfits,

245
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,489
they look to be treasure hunters.

246
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:14,489
No.

247
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,689
Even this old man, too.

248
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,289
Not an old man, but an old woman.

249
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,789
I slept well.

250
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,489
She's alive!

251
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,789
Which means that you're our rival, too?

252
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,289
You're a treasure hunter, aren't you?

253
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,889
I'm not here on leisure.

254
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,889
I just came to pay homage to the grave.

255
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,289
Grave?

256
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:55,189
Yes. Kichiemon's grave.

257
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,589
Kichiemon Samizu's grave?

258
00:17:57,589 --> 00:17:59,889
The grave of Kichiemon Samizu?

259
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,089
This time for sure, I'll be the first one!

260
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:06,289
At the rate you're going,

261
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,589
the kids will get to the treasure before you do.

262
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,589
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me.

263
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,489
Samizu Kichiemon."

264
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:19,389
Hey, grandma. Isn't this a code?

265
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,989
Oh, is it?

266
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:24,189
I just took it to be Kichiemon's gravestone.

267
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,789
But what does it mean?

268
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,889
Is it asking for some kind of offering?

269
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:33,389
But we have no flowers or food.

270
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:34,989
Come to think of it,

271
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,289
the man who was found in the swamp was also holding and hiding something.

272
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,489
The comma-shaped bead made of stone.

273
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,889
Sir.

274
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,389
You asked a while ago

275
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,389
if we found an odd looking stone, right?

276
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:54,389
Don't you have an odd stone on you, too?

277
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:55,889
What?

278
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,789
We found one, too.

279
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,989
One of the sacred treasures made of stone.

280
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:03,789
Hey, Conan.

281
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,989
Didn't you said to keep that a secret?

282
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,189
What was written on it?

283
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,689
Something was carved on the stone you found, right?

284
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:16,189
So you found one, too.

285
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,789
Well...

286
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,189
Oh, my.

287
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:24,289
Under these circumstances, I don't think that hogging information

288
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,789
would do anyone any good.

289
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,189
Right, right.

290
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,189
If you don't want to be excluded,

291
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,189
hurry up and show us what you have.

292
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:36,989
Okay.

293
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:48,189
The thing I found is this mirror made of stone.

294
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:51,989
The letter carved on it is forever from the word eternal.

295
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:55,289
Then, it does have something to do with the sun.

296
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,889
Because it keeps burning forever, too.

297
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:01,389
Which means that the one that you kids found

298
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:04,389
had something like flames carved on it?

299
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,289
Yes.

300
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,689
You hit the bull's eye.

301
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,589
But I can't make it out.

302
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:12,789
Forever and flames.

303
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,889
Maybe if we stick those stones somewhere inside the gravestone,

304
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:21,789
the God Nioh stone which is the diamond will come out?

305
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:23,589
What makes you think so?

306
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:28,189
Because it was carved inside the stone garden lantern

307
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:32,489
that the diamond would be in a busy place where elders get together, right?

308
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:36,389
Is this the busy place where elders get together?

309
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:38,889
Yes. What was it?

310
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,989
The resting place of the God Nioh?

311
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:45,389
The resting place of the God Nioh is nearest to the sun,

312
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:49,589
in an extremely busy location where the elders get together.

313
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:53,389
That is where the God Nioh stone is, right?

314
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:54,389
Yes!

315
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:56,489
I guess you want to interpret the part that goes,

316
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:03,189
"An extremely busy place where the elders get together"

317
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:05,889
to this shabby pile of dead bodies.

318
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,489
Yes.

319
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,989
But those here are the foolish ones

320
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,489
who have been blinded by greed and decayed,

321
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,489
not being able to find the way out of here.

322
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:20,989
When Kichiemon built this mansion, none of them were here.

323
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,589
I guess so.

324
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:25,489
Then you saw the lanterns, too?

325
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:29,389
They weren't sunk in the swamp though.

326
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,689
At any rate, I guess the treasure is not here.

327
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,789
Because this grave doesn't seem to have a place to insert the stone.

328
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:41,889
I guess we'll have to find the other sacred treasure

329
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,989
to solve the mystery.

330
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:45,689
The other?

331
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:48,189
They're called the three sacred treasures.

332
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:51,389
The mirror and the comma-shaped bead were found,

333
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,489
so there should be one more somewhere.

334
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,589
The three sacred treasures?

335
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:58,389
Yes. The mirror is the Mirror of Yata,

336
00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:01,589
the comma-shaped bead is called the Magatama of Yasakani.

337
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,389
And the remaining one

338
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,389
is the sword of the God Nioh.

339
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:09,589
It got its name because it is said to have saved God Takeru Yamato,

340
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,489
who was in a pinch

341
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:13,689
by slashing down the grass when fire was set to the field.

342
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:16,489
The Sword of Kusanagi.

343
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:22,589
-The Sword of Kusanagi? -The Sword of Kusanagi?

344
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:04,589
"Next Episode"

345
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:05,589
Brat!

346
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:11,189
"Lost ones, offer the sacred treasure to me."

347
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:23,589
We'll be washed down to the valley below by the water.

348
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:29,589
Next Conan, "Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion - Case Closed"

349
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,716
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:34,816
"Kichiemon Samizu"

351
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,116
Is Kichiemon some kind of gate?

352
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:37,916
-No. -It's the name of a person!

353
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,416
That's what it usually is.
