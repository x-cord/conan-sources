1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.470
Pops was chosen as

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.370
the Japanese Detective League's Best Detective Award.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.070
"Kokura Station" -We came to Kokura, Fukuoka,

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.570
to attend the award ceremony.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.670
"Miyajidake Shrine" -Leaving Ran, who wanted to go sightseeing,

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.870
"Munakata Taisha" -Pops and I stopped by the company

7
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.770
"Munakata Taisha" -run by Torazo Fukamachi,

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.170
"Tiger Tradings" -his senior from his police days, but...

9
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.470
He was hospitalized for an injury?

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.570
"Torazo Fukamachi (63), Tiger Tradings President"

11
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.370
A week ago, President Fukamachi accidentally tripped and hit his head,

12
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.370
and he was still unconscious in the hospital.

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870
Graffiti threatening Director Kiriyama,

14
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.370
the man next in line for the president's seat, was discovered.

15
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.570
As Pops began his investigation,

16
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.370
President Fukamachi's son, Torahiko,

17
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.070
emerged as his prime suspect.

18
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.470
"Torahiko Fukamachi (21), Torazo Fukamachi's Son"

19
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.970
Sorry, were you waiting long?

20
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.170
Huh?

21
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.270
Sorry, but could you be my girlfriend for a while?

22
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.370
What?

23
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.370
I'm being followed by bad men.

24
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.770
I just need 10 seconds.

25
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.870
What?

26
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.870
Let go!

27
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.870
Stop resisting!

28
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.270
What are you doing?

29
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.370
Stay out of the way!

30
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.370
Ran, what's wrong?

31
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.870
What happened?

32
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.970
Ran!

33
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370
In my eyes are maximum creation.

34
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.170
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

35
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.770
A series of cases plague those involved!

36
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770
What is the deep mystery hidden in Kokura and Moji?

37
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.270
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.470
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:29.927
"The Northern Kyushu Mystery Tour (Moji Arc)"

41
00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:33.327
Stay out of the way!

42
00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:37.327
Let's go!

43
00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:52.127
What are you doing?

44
00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:00.927
Oh, no!

45
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:02.027
This way.

46
00:04:07.427 --> 00:04:08.527
It's an emergency!

47
00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:10.427
Something must've happened to Ran!

48
00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:15.927
"Tiger Tradings"

49
00:04:18.927 --> 00:04:20.127
Ran.

50
00:04:33.527 --> 00:04:36.427
Darn it. Where did they go?

51
00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:37.927
Ran!

52
00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:49.427
Mr. Mouri.

53
00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:52.127
Don't worry.

54
00:04:52.127 --> 00:04:53.527
Who are you?

55
00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.527
Have you seen a young blond man?

56
00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:57.727
What?

57
00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:01.927
He came running this way with a young woman.

58
00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:06.027
Who are you?

59
00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:07.527
The police?

60
00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:12.127
-Yeah. -Those two were police officers?

61
00:05:12.127 --> 00:05:14.127
I've known them since high school.

62
00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:16.527
"Ginji Nakamaru (38)" -They're from Kokura Station.

63
00:05:16.527 --> 00:05:17.927
"Shuhei Shigaki (42)" -They've been chasing me around

64
00:05:17.927 --> 00:05:21.427
because they think I wrote that graffiti.

65
00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:23.127
What am I going to do?

66
00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:25.127
I attacked some police officers.

67
00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.427
You were trying to save me.

68
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.927
You did nothing wrong.

69
00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.627
It's my fault.

70
00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:35.727
Did you write the graffiti, Torahiko?

71
00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:37.127
It wasn't me.

72
00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:39.127
Then you shouldn't run.

73
00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:41.427
You need to talk to the police.

74
00:05:45.727 --> 00:05:48.027
If I go to the police now,

75
00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:51.127
they'll treat me like a criminal.

76
00:05:51.127 --> 00:05:54.627
Some of them think I hurt my dad.

77
00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:55.627
What?

78
00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:59.227
Someone pushed my dad from behind.

79
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:01.127
I can't let them arrest me

80
00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.927
until I find evidence of the culprit.

81
00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:04.427
What evidence?

82
00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:08.227
Apparently my dad said "tora" (tiger) in the ambulance.

83
00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:12.127
There's a stuffed doll called Toraccha in my dad's car.

84
00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:18.127
There used to be a GPS and security camera inside of it.

85
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:22.627
It's possible the culprit's voice or image or something else

86
00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:25.427
that could serve as evidence were captured by it.

87
00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:30.327
Don't answer it.

88
00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:32.427
It's okay. It's Conan.

89
00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:37.127
Ran, you're with Mr. Torahiko, aren't you?

90
00:06:37.127 --> 00:06:38.827
How did you know?

91
00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:42.427
Pops is desperately looking for you.

92
00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:45.427
Ran, where are you?

93
00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:48.827
Ran, where are you?

94
00:06:50.027 --> 00:06:51.227
Ran!

95
00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:53.427
What should I do, Conan?

96
00:06:53.427 --> 00:06:54.727
"Tiger Tradings" -It's okay.

97
00:06:54.727 --> 00:06:57.927
He'll solve everything.

98
00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:01.327
Convince Mr. Torahiko not to run.

99
00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:06.927
Torahiko.

100
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.427
If you're innocent,

101
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.227
my father will protect you.

102
00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:15.627
Let's go back to the others.

103
00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:19.027
My dad's a pretty good detective.

104
00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:22.227
I know.

105
00:07:22.227 --> 00:07:23.327
What?

106
00:07:26.027 --> 00:07:29.227
My dad bragged that

107
00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:31.127
one of his juniors from his MPD days

108
00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:34.527
is a famous detective named Kogoro Mouri.

109
00:07:34.527 --> 00:07:35.727
I see.

110
00:07:37.627 --> 00:07:39.527
Yeah.

111
00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:42.727
Are you listening, Ran?

112
00:07:42.727 --> 00:07:44.827
It's okay, Conan.

113
00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:48.227
Torahiko and I will head your way now.

114
00:07:48.227 --> 00:07:49.327
That's good.

115
00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:53.827
I also have a request for Mr. Torahiko.

116
00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:55.127
A request?

117
00:07:56.427 --> 00:07:57.627
What?

118
00:07:57.627 --> 00:08:00.827
Ran and Torahiko are heading towards the office?

119
00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:01.827
Yeah.

120
00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:05.627
They want you to reveal the truth there.

121
00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.527
Who? Me?

122
00:08:07.527 --> 00:08:09.627
It's time for the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

123
00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:11.227
to show off his skills.

124
00:08:11.227 --> 00:08:13.827
Insolent brat!

125
00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:14.927
Fine.

126
00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:17.127
As long as Ran comes back safe,

127
00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:19.227
I'll handle the rest.

128
00:08:19.227 --> 00:08:21.027
We'll help.

129
00:08:21.027 --> 00:08:23.327
It's an honor to work alongside

130
00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:25.827
the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

131
00:08:25.827 --> 00:08:29.527
Please gather everyone connected to the case.

132
00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:32.227
"Noriko Izumi (28)" -Director Kiriyama is at the hospital.

133
00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:34.627
I doubt he'll be able to return right away.

134
00:08:34.627 --> 00:08:35.727
The hospital?

135
00:08:35.727 --> 00:08:38.527
Yes, he's visiting the president.

136
00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:41.127
That's odd.

137
00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:45.427
He told me not to visit Fukamachi.

138
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:48.327
That's it! I've figured it out!

139
00:08:53.227 --> 00:08:56.227
"President's Office"

140
00:09:00.127 --> 00:09:01.527
I've been waiting for you,

141
00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:04.227
"Eisaku Kiriyama (45)" -Director Kiriyama.

142
00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:11.927
Mr. Mouri, is it true that you've determined who's responsible

143
00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:13.227
for the graffiti?

144
00:09:13.227 --> 00:09:17.327
Yes. That's why I asked all of you to come here.

145
00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:20.727
But the shareholders' meeting starts at 3 pm,

146
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.427
so we don't have much time.

147
00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:24.227
Could we hurry, please?

148
00:09:24.227 --> 00:09:26.327
Despite being short on time,

149
00:09:26.327 --> 00:09:28.827
you visited President Fukamachi

150
00:09:28.827 --> 00:09:31.127
in the hospital, didn't you?

151
00:09:31.127 --> 00:09:32.127
Yes.

152
00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:34.627
He's still unconscious,

153
00:09:34.627 --> 00:09:39.027
but I thought I'd tell him about the shareholders' meeting.

154
00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:43.227
Was there some reason you didn't want me to visit him?

155
00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:46.227
Mr. Mouri, what are you trying to say?

156
00:09:46.227 --> 00:09:48.627
You're the one who pushed President Fukamachi,

157
00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:49.927
aren't you?

158
00:09:49.927 --> 00:09:51.127
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:51.127 --> 00:09:53.127
Wrong guy, Pops.

160
00:09:53.127 --> 00:09:55.327
Once the president regains consciousness,

161
00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:58.327
we'll know you did it.

162
00:09:58.327 --> 00:10:01.627
That is why you went to the hospital.

163
00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:03.227
Is that it?

164
00:10:08.627 --> 00:10:10.427
Is that...

165
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:11.927
The Sleeping Kogoro!

166
00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:16.727
Director Kiriyama, please don't be upset.

167
00:10:16.727 --> 00:10:21.127
Your visit to the hospital has nothing to do with the case.

168
00:10:21.127 --> 00:10:22.827
Then who did it?

169
00:10:22.827 --> 00:10:25.627
If you know, tell us!

170
00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:28.827
The first thing we should make clear

171
00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:32.527
is that Torahiko didn't write the graffiti.

172
00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:33.627
What?

173
00:10:33.627 --> 00:10:35.127
"Makoto Ukaji (42), President's Driver" -That's ridiculous!

174
00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:37.527
Mr. Iwata saw him do it.

175
00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:42.027
Mr. Iwata, you said the culprit was blond, correct?

176
00:10:42.027 --> 00:10:44.127
"Genichiro Iwata (63), Tiger Tradings Security Guard" -Yes.

177
00:10:44.127 --> 00:10:46.527
But three days ago in the morning, when the buildings were vandalized,

178
00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:50.127
Torahiko wasn't blond yet.

179
00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:51.427
What?

180
00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:52.427
Conan!

181
00:10:52.427 --> 00:10:54.327
Here!

182
00:10:54.327 --> 00:10:57.927
Mr. Torahiko was looking for work in Tokyo,

183
00:10:57.927 --> 00:11:01.527
so he'd been keeping his hair black for some time.

184
00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.727
See?

185
00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:06.727
Mr. Torahiko just sent me this photo.

186
00:11:06.727 --> 00:11:08.427
And that's not all.

187
00:11:08.427 --> 00:11:10.727
The night Mr. Iwata saw the culprit,

188
00:11:10.727 --> 00:11:13.327
this photo was taken at Airs Cafe.

189
00:11:13.327 --> 00:11:14.427
See?

190
00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:16.627
Mr. Torahiko said he dyed his hair blond

191
00:11:16.627 --> 00:11:19.927
the day after the graffiti was discovered.

192
00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:22.627
Why don't you check with the salon?

193
00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:25.327
But why did he dyed his hair blond again?

194
00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:28.627
Mr. Torahiko wanted to pump himself up.

195
00:11:28.627 --> 00:11:31.727
He was determined not to let the police beat him

196
00:11:31.727 --> 00:11:34.427
until he discovered the truth.

197
00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:39.927
I may have been mistaken about the blond hair.

198
00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:43.427
Mr. Iwata, after we met at the parking lot today,

199
00:11:43.427 --> 00:11:44.927
you came here, didn't you?

200
00:11:46.427 --> 00:11:49.027
What? In the president's office?

201
00:11:49.027 --> 00:11:52.327
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

202
00:11:52.327 --> 00:11:55.527
I found this in the garbage can.

203
00:11:55.527 --> 00:11:57.827
It looks like a bank envelope.

204
00:11:57.827 --> 00:11:59.627
There's donut crumbs on it,

205
00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:02.427
so maybe Mr. Ukaji threw it away.

206
00:12:02.427 --> 00:12:05.727
Hey! Don't go making wild accusations!

207
00:12:05.727 --> 00:12:08.227
I'm scared!

208
00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.427
Officers,

209
00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:12.827
could you have your forensics team examine that envelope?

210
00:12:12.827 --> 00:12:16.827
I'm sure you'll find Mr. Iwata and Mr. Ukaji's fingerprints on it.

211
00:12:16.827 --> 00:12:18.327
Understood.

212
00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:28.427
How much was inside the envelope, Mr. Ukaji?

213
00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:33.127
I'm asking how much Mr. Iwata paid you.

214
00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:37.427
Are you saying I blackmailed Mr. Iwata?

215
00:12:37.427 --> 00:12:38.827
That's right!

216
00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:40.427
That's ridiculous!

217
00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:44.427
Mr. Ukaji, you don't know the truth.

218
00:12:44.427 --> 00:12:46.127
The truth?

219
00:12:46.127 --> 00:12:48.127
The culprit's goal.

220
00:12:48.127 --> 00:12:50.427
Wasn't it to threaten Director Kiriyama?

221
00:12:50.427 --> 00:12:55.727
No. The culprit's goal was to murder you.

222
00:12:55.727 --> 00:12:56.827
What?

223
00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:15.594
They were trying to kill me?

224
00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.894
Isn't that right, Mr. Iwata?

225
00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:22.494
You wanted to kill Mr. Ukaji.

226
00:13:22.494 --> 00:13:24.894
But if you went after him directly,

227
00:13:24.894 --> 00:13:27.094
the police would investigate his associates

228
00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:30.294
and discover he was threatening you

229
00:13:30.294 --> 00:13:32.394
and realize you did it.

230
00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:36.894
That's why you used that graffiti

231
00:13:36.894 --> 00:13:41.094
to make everyone believe Director Kiriyama was the target.

232
00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:43.194
"Tiger"

233
00:13:43.194 --> 00:13:45.694
If Director Kiriyama was killed

234
00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:49.494
and Mr. Ukaji got caught in the crossfire,

235
00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:50.894
then suspicion would fall on Torahiko,

236
00:13:50.894 --> 00:13:53.194
who was assumed to have vandalized the buildings.

237
00:13:53.194 --> 00:13:55.794
You wouldn't be suspected.

238
00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:57.994
On what basis do you say that?

239
00:13:57.994 --> 00:14:00.194
Conan, bring it to me.

240
00:14:00.194 --> 00:14:01.394
Okay!

241
00:14:03.794 --> 00:14:07.394
Mr. Iwata, you left this inside the president's car, didn't you?

242
00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:09.794
No. I don't know what you're talking about!

243
00:14:09.794 --> 00:14:11.994
I thought it was strange.

244
00:14:11.994 --> 00:14:15.594
The Toraccha in the photo I took

245
00:14:15.594 --> 00:14:20.794
was dirty and old like the one Mr. Fukamachi was holding.

246
00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:23.694
But this Toraccha is brand new.

247
00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:26.494
Since you left it outside while washing the car,

248
00:14:26.494 --> 00:14:28.194
it's a little damp too.

249
00:14:28.194 --> 00:14:29.894
You're lying!

250
00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:34.294
Maybe you hid the old Toraccha in your toolbox.

251
00:14:39.394 --> 00:14:41.194
See? I knew it.

252
00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:42.194
Huh?

253
00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:43.694
Did you use this toolbox to store

254
00:14:43.694 --> 00:14:47.394
the red spray paint you used for the graffiti too?

255
00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:52.094
Let go! There's no time!

256
00:14:52.094 --> 00:14:53.594
There's no time?

257
00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:56.694
It's a bomb!

258
00:14:56.694 --> 00:14:59.294
It'll explode in 10 minutes!

259
00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:01.294
-What? -A bomb?

260
00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:02.894
In 10 minutes?

261
00:15:02.894 --> 00:15:07.194
It's okay. I just bought this Toraccha.

262
00:15:07.194 --> 00:15:10.094
It's not your bomb.

263
00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:12.794
What?

264
00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:16.694
If it's set to explode in 10 minutes,

265
00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:20.494
then that means you set it for 2:30 pm, right?

266
00:15:20.494 --> 00:15:22.294
2:30 pm?

267
00:15:22.294 --> 00:15:27.294
Mr. Ukaji would be driving the president's car then.

268
00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:30.794
He'd be taking Director Kiriyama to the shareholders' meeting.

269
00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:35.094
You were planning to blow up me and the director?

270
00:15:35.094 --> 00:15:39.194
Then the real bomb's still inside the president's car?

271
00:15:39.194 --> 00:15:40.894
Don't worry about that.

272
00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:44.494
Mr. Mouri called the prefectural police earlier.

273
00:15:44.494 --> 00:15:47.494
The bomb squad is already there.

274
00:15:47.494 --> 00:15:49.094
He called to tell us about the bomb

275
00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:52.994
inside the stuffed tiger in the president's car.

276
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.094
How did you know?

277
00:15:55.094 --> 00:15:57.394
In high school,

278
00:15:57.394 --> 00:16:00.494
Torahiko stole gunpowder from your fireworks factory

279
00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:03.094
to build a bomb.

280
00:16:03.094 --> 00:16:04.994
In order to frame Torahiko

281
00:16:04.994 --> 00:16:10.394
for the murder of Mr. Ukaji and Director Kiriyama,

282
00:16:10.394 --> 00:16:13.994
you believed setting a bomb inside the Toraccha was the best method.

283
00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:18.194
You even had the skills to build a bomb.

284
00:16:23.094 --> 00:16:27.494
Mr. Iwata, what happened in the parking lot that day?

285
00:16:28.594 --> 00:16:31.294
Torazo and I were childhood friends,

286
00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:33.894
but he tried to fire me anyway.

287
00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:43.694
Torazo, let me keep working a little longer.

288
00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:45.294
Gen.

289
00:16:45.294 --> 00:16:49.794
I'm sorry but I've already decided to hire a security company.

290
00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:52.094
You should learn to do desk work.

291
00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:55.694
No! I like how easy things are now!

292
00:16:55.694 --> 00:16:57.794
Don't be so selfish.

293
00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:07.894
Torazo.

294
00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:12.194
I got scared and ran,

295
00:17:12.194 --> 00:17:14.394
but later...

296
00:17:15.494 --> 00:17:20.494
Last month the president told me to install a dash cam.

297
00:17:20.494 --> 00:17:23.494
It's all on there.

298
00:17:23.494 --> 00:17:26.594
You pushing the president.

299
00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:33.894
Get me 500 thousand by the end of the week, got it?

300
00:17:35.894 --> 00:17:40.994
Maybe the president was trying to say "dorareko" in the ambulance.

301
00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:42.094
"Dorareko" (Dash cam)?

302
00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.294
"Dorareko" (Dash cam).

303
00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:44.494
In other words,

304
00:17:44.494 --> 00:17:47.694
he wanted us to check the dash cam footage.

305
00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:52.194
I only took 500 thousand yen!

306
00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:54.894
Why would you kill me over that?

307
00:17:54.894 --> 00:17:57.794
You were going to blackmail me for the rest of my life!

308
00:17:57.794 --> 00:17:59.794
It would've been more than 500 thousand yen!

309
00:17:59.794 --> 00:18:01.194
What?

310
00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:02.894
Shut up, both of you!

311
00:18:02.894 --> 00:18:04.994
Do you have any idea how sad the president would be

312
00:18:04.994 --> 00:18:07.894
if he found of what you did?

313
00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:17.294
Torahiko and Ran are late.

314
00:18:17.294 --> 00:18:18.294
It's an emergency!

315
00:18:18.294 --> 00:18:21.594
The car! The car that have a bomb inside is missing!

316
00:18:22.694 --> 00:18:23.994
No way!

317
00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:30.494
Where are we going, Torahiko?

318
00:18:30.494 --> 00:18:33.194
You promised we'd rejoin the others.

319
00:18:33.194 --> 00:18:36.494
I need to deliver Toraccha to the TV station first.

320
00:18:36.494 --> 00:18:37.994
The TV station?

321
00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:40.194
I'm going to have them make a broadcast.

322
00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:42.694
We still don't know who the culprit is.

323
00:18:42.694 --> 00:18:44.094
If we don't leave the evidence with them,

324
00:18:44.094 --> 00:18:46.394
the culprit might try to hide it.

325
00:18:50.394 --> 00:18:53.294
Torahiko, stop the car!

326
00:18:53.294 --> 00:18:56.994
I can't believe he stole the car with the bomb.

327
00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:00.594
Conan.

328
00:19:00.594 --> 00:19:02.194
Ran, listen closely.

329
00:19:02.194 --> 00:19:03.694
That Toraccha...

330
00:19:10.694 --> 00:19:12.494
Ran, what happened?

331
00:19:14.094 --> 00:19:15.694
Conan!

332
00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:18.594
There's a bomb inside that Toraccha!

333
00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:20.394
Huh? What?

334
00:19:28.794 --> 00:19:31.094
It's going to explode in three minutes!

335
00:19:31.094 --> 00:19:32.794
What's happening in three minutes?

336
00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:34.394
Say it again.

337
00:19:34.394 --> 00:19:36.494
It's a bomb! A bomb!

338
00:19:36.494 --> 00:19:38.494
-A bomb? -What?

339
00:19:38.494 --> 00:19:40.894
There's a bomb inside that Toraccha!

340
00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:42.094
Throw it away quick!

341
00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:43.194
What?

342
00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:55.594
Stop the car!

343
00:19:58.094 --> 00:19:59.594
Twenty seconds left.

344
00:19:59.594 --> 00:20:00.994
Ran!

345
00:20:00.994 --> 00:20:02.894
Dad!

346
00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:06.394
Ten seconds left.

347
00:20:09.494 --> 00:20:11.194
Go!

348
00:20:18.494 --> 00:20:21.094
That former firework maker.

349
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:24.394
He even made a flamboyant bomb.

350
00:21:48.394 --> 00:21:52.094
"Aruaru City"

351
00:21:52.094 --> 00:21:55.094
"Best Detective Award Ceremony"

352
00:21:56.194 --> 00:21:58.594
What a cozy party.

353
00:21:58.594 --> 00:22:00.094
I'm overjoyed.

354
00:22:00.094 --> 00:22:04.794
This event's being hosted by the historic Japanese Detective League.

355
00:22:04.794 --> 00:22:09.194
I've never heard of the Japanese Detective League.

356
00:22:11.294 --> 00:22:15.194
We've been waiting for you, Mr. Mouri.

357
00:22:15.194 --> 00:22:17.294
Ms. Izumi.

358
00:22:21.894 --> 00:22:26.294
Congratulations on your Best Detective Award.

359
00:22:26.294 --> 00:22:28.594
Ms. Izumi, why are you here?

360
00:22:35.094 --> 00:22:37.494
Fukamachi.

361
00:22:37.494 --> 00:22:43.294
Kogoro Mouri, congratulations on your Best Detective Award.

362
00:22:43.294 --> 00:22:44.394
Fukamachi.

363
00:22:44.394 --> 00:22:46.194
It's been so long.

364
00:22:46.194 --> 00:22:48.994
I'm glad you're doing well.

365
00:22:48.994 --> 00:22:51.294
You too.

366
00:22:51.294 --> 00:22:55.694
He actually regained consciousness a few days ago,

367
00:22:55.694 --> 00:22:58.894
but he'd lost his memories of the accident.

368
00:22:58.894 --> 00:23:02.894
We decided to hire you to uncover the truth.

369
00:23:02.894 --> 00:23:06.694
The Director even kept it secret from me.

370
00:23:06.694 --> 00:23:08.794
I see.

371
00:23:08.794 --> 00:23:13.094
The president will be our president a while longer.

372
00:23:13.094 --> 00:23:16.794
At least until Torahiko becomes a proper adult.

373
00:23:16.794 --> 00:23:18.794
Good luck, Torahiko.

374
00:23:18.794 --> 00:23:19.994
Thanks.

375
00:23:19.994 --> 00:23:21.994
The Japanese Detective League

376
00:23:21.994 --> 00:23:26.394
was created by President Fukamachi to support you, Mouri.

377
00:23:26.394 --> 00:23:28.794
What? You did?

378
00:23:28.794 --> 00:23:31.294
Keep up the good work.

379
00:23:31.294 --> 00:23:33.594
Thank you, sir!

380
00:23:33.594 --> 00:23:36.894
I'm sure the life of the man known as the Tiger of Sakuradamon

381
00:23:36.894 --> 00:23:39.694
will make a magnificent drama.

382
00:23:39.694 --> 00:23:43.194
Since you're a tiger, it'll surely be a roaring success.

383
00:23:43.194 --> 00:23:44.594
Just kidding.

384
00:23:47.194 --> 00:23:49.694
Dad.

385
00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:52.794
Who are you, Kogoro the Punster?

386
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.894
"Next Episode"

387
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:58.894
What?

388
00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:01.294
You must be joking.

389
00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:02.494
Excuse me.

390
00:24:02.494 --> 00:24:05.994
I'm a huge horse racing fan.

391
00:24:05.994 --> 00:24:08.694
I'd actually like to hire you.

392
00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:10.494
Huh?

393
00:24:10.494 --> 00:24:12.094
What?

394
00:24:12.094 --> 00:24:13.794
"Construction 50m Ahead, Detour" -What's wrong?

395
00:24:13.794 --> 00:24:16.294
Hold on. You can't just...

396
00:24:16.294 --> 00:24:18.094
Follow that car!

397
00:24:18.794 --> 00:24:20.294
Next Conan,

398
00:24:20.294 --> 00:24:24.294
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 1)"

399
00:24:25.037 --> 00:24:27.337
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:27.337 --> 00:24:29.337
"Horse blanket"

401
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:30.837
The next episode is a story about a horse.

402
00:24:30.837 --> 00:24:32.537
Leave knowledge about horse gambling to me!

403
00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.237
Not that!
