1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,190
The old man and I were riding the monorail.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,020
A shot was fired into the
car, injuring a passenger.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,280
We began searching for the culprit
based on the bullet's path

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,280
and arrived at an apartment believed
to be the shooter's location.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,570
The police's examination of the room determined
that it was not the location of the shooter,

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,730
but possibly the scene of a murder.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,570
The monorail passenger wasn't sniped.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,250
They were struck by a stray bullet.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,420
And the culprit seems to have
transported the victim to Toto Market.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:52,280
Toto Market

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,890
The culprit should be somewhere in here.

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,090
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

13
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,350
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,800
The shooter disappears into
the crowd at the market!

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Why are they carrying their victim with them?

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,090
Always determining the one truth

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,140
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,720
his name is Detective Conan!

19
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,470
The Monorail Sniper Case (Part Two)

20
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,460
The Monorail Sniper Case (Part Two)
"The Monorail Sniper Case, Part Two!"

21
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,950
The Monorail Sniper Case (Part Two)

22
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
Checkpoint

23
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Please Stop!

24
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,720
Yamato Sushi

25
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,470
Mitoriya Restaurant

26
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,780
I know we said a person transporting
something large wouldn't stand out here.

27
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,190
But everyone here is
transporting something large.

28
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,910
There's no way to find the culprit.

29
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,780
But they must be here somewhere.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,920
Detective Takagi.

31
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,690
Did you find something?

32
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,920
Yes, sir. Could you come with me immediately?

33
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,380
Got it.

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,180
I thought I was going to die.

35
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,680
Are you hurt?

36
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,430
My head hurts a little, but I'm fine.

37
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,180
What happened?

38
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't know where to begin.

39
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,190
I was hungry, so I was walking around
looking for something to eat.

40
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,700
I saw something behind this
pillar, so I approached it.

41
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,360
There was this big thing
wrapped in a plastic sheet.

42
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,370
Then...

43
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,090
Did you see their face?

44
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,390
I was looking at the
thing wrapped in plastic.

45
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,090
So you didn't see who did it.

46
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,100
I was hit from behind. I didn't see anything.

47
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,140
By the way, what color and type
of clothes were you wearing?

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,150
What color was I wearing today?

49
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,710
Mori-san.

50
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,860
The culprit probably took this man's clothes

51
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,950
so he wouldn't attract attention while
transporting the object wrapped in plastic.

52
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,330
Detective Takagi, this man's clothes and
keys to his turret truck are missing.

53
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,380
Oddly enough, I still have my wallet.

54
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,750
Why did they only take my clothes and keys?

55
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,550
As you thought, the culprit has hidden
themselves here in Toto Market.

56
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,010
And stolen a turret truck so they can transport
the victim without attracting attention.

57
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,080
Could you tell us your truck's
number and describe it to us?

58
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,220
It's Chiba.

59
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,580
Hello?

60
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,590
I thought I'd call you to
report on a few things.

61
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,900
First, there's Maruta Daisuke-san,
the man shot in the monorail car,

62
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,840
and the woman we're holding inside the car.

63
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,080
Tamura Kiyomi   32 years old
Maruta Daisuke 28 years old
Akiyama Ichiro 47 years old

64
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,850
Tamura Kiyomi   32 years old
Maruta Daisuke 28 years old
Akiyama Ichiro 47 years old
Her name is Tamura Kiyomi-san.

65
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,220
Tamura Kiyomi   32 years old
Maruta Daisuke 28 years old
Akiyama Ichiro 47 years old
It's likely that she simply
got caught up in the incident.

66
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,770
Neither of them have criminal records,

67
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,980
and there was nothing suspicious
about their testimonies.

68
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,480
Akiyama Ichiro 47 years old

69
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,730
Akiyama Ichiro 47 years old
Next, the resident of room
505 at Prime Toto Wangan.

70
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,090
Akiyama Ichiro (47)

71
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,160
Akiyama Ichiro (47)
His name is Akiyama Ichiro-san.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,690
Akiyama Ichiro (47)

73
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,360
Akiyama Ichiro (47)
He worked in sales for a leasing company
and left his job at the end of last month.

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,150
He worked in sales for a leasing company
and left his job at the end of last month.

75
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,870
He has an ordinary license and
no criminal record, but...

76
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,320
There's something suspicious about him?

77
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,110
Yes.

78
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,030
He's a suspect in the attack
on the bank transport truck

79
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,310
He's a suspect in the attack
on the bank transport truck

80
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,000
that occurred in Beika City four months ago.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,510
that occurred in Beika City four months ago.
Akiyama Ichiro (47)

82
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,920
Wh-What?

83
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,250
He was apparently removed
from the list of suspects

84
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,430
because his alibi for the time
of the crime was verified.

85
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,670
We received testimony that he began spending
lavishly immediately after the incident.

86
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,320
So he ended up quitting his
job after losing control.

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,580
Detective Takagi, that attack...

88
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,570
Yes, it's still unsolved.

89
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,320
It happened four months ago.

90
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,530
Beika Bank ATM

91
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,830
Beika Bank ATM
A Beika Bank transport truck was attacked.

92
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,210
The attackers suddenly blocked a narrow
road in a residential neighborhood.

93
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,920
They became trapped in a dead-end alleyway.

94
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,810
The two guards were threatened with guns.

95
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,900
After they were tied up,

96
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,060
the culprits stole the 150 million
yen in cash they were transporting,

97
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,910
along with the truck itself.

98
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,720
We received testimony that the gun
used in the attack was a Tokarev,

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,980
just like the one used in this case.

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,730
Later, the truck was found near
the Teimuzu River embankment.

101
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:56,940
Aside from the change and fake bills
containing transmitters for tracking purposes,

102
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,370
all the cash inside the truck was stolen.

103
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:06,880
Judging by the culprits' method, we believe
they knew the truck's schedule and route.

104
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,510
If that information was
leaked to the culprits...

105
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,510
None of the bank employees
were suspects, right?

106
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,620
Yeah.

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,290
Apparently they didn't find
anyone suspicious at the time.

108
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,640
That's it.

109
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,940
If a bank employee was leaking information,
even if they kept a low profile at the time...

110
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,400
They may have chosen to
act four months later.

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,900
Got it.

112
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,410
I'll follow up with the bank employees
and see what they're doing now.

113
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,950
Thanks, go ahead and do that.

114
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,690
Detective Takagi.

115
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,840
Did something happen?

116
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,170
We found the stolen turret truck.

117
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,870
What do you think?

118
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,210
Looks like it was abandoned near this exit.

119
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,440
They may have fled the area
after seeing all the police.

120
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,730
But why would they abandon the
truck in such an obvious location?

121
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,870
To me, it looks like they wanted
us to believe they ran away.

122
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,950
It's possible they wanted us to think
that and really did leave the area.

123
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,130
We'll have to search for new possibilities.

124
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,880
Hey, mister.

125
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,880
What did the culprit come here to do?

126
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,400
To get lost in the crowd, obviously.

127
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,390
What did the culprit intend to do after that?

128
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,640
Probably hide themselves
or the victim, right?

129
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,290
Where could they hide both
themselves and the body?

130
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,460
Someplace deserted, perhaps?

131
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,420
There's nowhere like that
in this crowded market.

132
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,650
Oh, right.

133
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,160
I see.

134
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,250
Nobody would come here.

135
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,650
It's the perfect place to hide the victim.

136
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,850
It's the perfect place to hide the victim.
Safety First

137
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,170
Safety First
Hey, look.

138
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,670
The lock's been broken.

139
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,050
Those marks look fresh.

140
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,300
Let's open it.

141
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,670
Got it.

142
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,590
Let's go.

143
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,410
From: Chiba Kazunobu
To: Takagi Wataru

144
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,810
From: Chiba Kazunobu
To: Takagi Wataru
This is a list and photos of bank employees
who didn't come in to work today.

145
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,940
This is a list and photos of bank employees
who didn't come in to work today.
Kiyama Osamu

146
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,310
This is a list and photos of bank employees
who didn't come in to work today.
Samejima Takuro

147
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,190
Samejima Takuro

148
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,400
What are you doing?

149
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
The culprit could be hiding here.

150
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,530
Focus, Takagi.

151
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,400
S-Sorry, Mori-san.

152
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,910
Chiba sent me a message.

153
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,260
This place is pretty big.

154
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,420
It's big and deserted.

155
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,180
It's the perfect place to hide a body.

156
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,840
Mister.

157
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,600
Yeah.

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,860
No! Don't do it!

159
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,360
Please don't!

160
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,200
Are you all right?

161
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,090
I-I've been shot.

162
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,170
Shot? Who shot you?

163
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,100
I-I don't know.

164
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,850
But the man who shot me went that way.

165
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,590
All right, hurry.

166
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,150
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,810
We'll call an ambulance right away.

168
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,280
Thank you.

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,370
Where is he?

170
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,700
He's not over here!

171
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,120
Toto Market

172
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,170
He's not here either!

173
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,700
Where did he go?

174
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,340
We're playing hide-and-seek.

175
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,050
Huh?

176
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,110
Are they hiding somewhere, or...?

177
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,480
Toto Market

178
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,660
We've arrived.

179
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,290
Huh?

180
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,170
What's going on here?

181
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,300
Hey, mister. Why did the culprit shoot you?

182
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,300
What are you talking about, kid?

183
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,720
What were you doing here?

184
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,710
The lock on the entrance was broken,
so I thought I'd take a look inside.

185
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,730
Huh? You smell like gasoline, mister.

186
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,150
C-Come to think of it,

187
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,620
I accidentally spilled some on my feet when
I was filling my turret truck with gas earlier.

188
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,380
I see. Accidentally, huh?

189
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,400
Sometimes my daughter yells at me when
I accidentally spill beer on my pa—

190
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,840
Yells at me when I... spill on myself...

191
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,300
Mori-san?

192
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,350
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

193
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,560
Why don't you stop playing dumb?

194
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,790
An examination of your clothes

195
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,940
would quickly reveal them to be the
ones stole from the wholesaler.

196
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,450
And examining that body would reveal
what you were attempting to do.

197
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,450
Really? By the way, what was I trying to do?

198
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,620
That body is on top of a plastic sheet.

199
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,630
There's a knife next to it.

200
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,660
What were you planning to do with that knife?

201
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,630
Damage the body, perhaps?

202
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,980
Were you not intending to cut open the body?

203
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,390
Wh-Why would I do that?

204
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,400
Detective Takagi.

205
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:16,250
Allow me to explain why you
were attempting to do that.

206
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,410
It became clear to me once I considered
several pieces of information.

207
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:28,670
Are you not one of the individuals who
attacked the bank transport truck four months ago?

208
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,150
And that victim lying
on the ground over there

209
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,700
was probably your accomplice.

210
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,560
He was trying to keep the
stolen money for himself.

211
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,380
When you learned that,

212
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,560
you entered his apartment to demand
the location of the money from him.

213
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,740
Sensing his life was in danger,

214
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,860
the victim pretended to follow your orders

215
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,670
and waited for an opportunity
to swallow something.

216
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,950
In a fit of rage, you got into a
tussle with the victim, and then...

217
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,010
The gun went off.

218
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,150
The bullet flew into the monorail
car and struck a passenger.

219
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,390
Because of that, the incident was discovered,
and you were forced to run around with the body.

220
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,140
You don't even know who I am.

221
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,630
Detective Takagi, could you read the
list you received from Detective Chiba?

222
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,400
Yes, Mori-san.

223
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,490
Samejima Takuro, 42 years old.

224
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,720
Samejima Takuro, 42 years old.
Samejima Takuro

225
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,140
Samejima Takuro
Works at Beika Bank Headquarters.

226
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,410
Samejima Takuro

227
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,730
You've been on paid leave since two days ago.

228
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,160
Apparently you told your co-workers
that you were going to Taiwan.

229
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,200
Why did you lie about going to Taiwan?

230
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,960
Is lying to my co-workers a crime?

231
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,470
No, but attacking a person and stealing
their clothes and truck are crimes.

232
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,260
We just happen to be
wearing the same clothes.

233
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,850
It's a coincidence.

234
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,620
Carrying a gun, armed robbery,
and murder are crimes!

235
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,900
You mean just carrying a gun is a crime?

236
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,400
Doesn't that make police
officers criminals, too?

237
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,170
How does it feel knowing that you had to
flee with a body because that gun went off?

238
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,660
What are you talking about?

239
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,170
He must've been heavy.

240
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,690
Because you were distracted by his
weight, you left that blood behind.

241
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,670
Again, what are you talking about?

242
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,960
You did your best to clean it,

243
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,720
but there was gunshot residue and a large
amount of blood in the victim's apartment.

244
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,430
I'm telling you, I have no idea
what you're talking about!

245
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,980
But you did attack the bank
transport truck, right?

246
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,230
I don't know what you're
trying to get me to say,

247
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,480
but I didn't attack the transport truck,
and I didn't kill Akiyama either!

248
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,120
What?

249
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,870
Detective Takagi.

250
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes, I heard him clearly.

251
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,450
Samejima-san, you really are the culprit.

252
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,880
Wh-What are you talking about? I...

253
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,940
You still haven't noticed?

254
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,510
None of us said the name Akiyama-san.

255
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,870
Impressive as always, Mori-san.

256
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,600
If Conan-kun hadn't sent me this message,

257
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,020
I would've accidentally said his name.

258
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,970
From: Edogawa Conan

259
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,780
From: Edogawa Conan
That was a clever trick to get
the culprit to reveal himself.

260
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,550
There were a lot of
uncertainties in this case.

261
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,030
We needed the culprit to confess
to be sure we could arrest him.

262
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,290
Impressive work, Sleeping Kogoro.

263
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,300
Impressive, my ass!

264
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,160
I know!

265
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,040
I'll take you to hell with me!

266
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,340
Die!

267
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,980
Samejima Takuro, you're under
arrest for attempted murder.

268
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,730
I can't believe how clumsy I am.

269
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,500
I always screw up important things.

270
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,990
I never got my hands on that money either.

271
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,630
Where did things go wrong?

272
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,230
When the gun went off?

273
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,310
When he swallowed the key to the locker

274
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,750
where he hid the money so he
could keep it for himself?

275
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,710
When you planned to commit armed robbery.

276
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,640
Later, the key to a coin locker was
found inside the victim's stomach.

277
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,240
The cash stolen from the bank was
found inside a locker at Toto Station.

278
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,890
This strange case initially
thought to be a shooting

279
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,850
ended with us solving an
open transport truck attack

280
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,900
and related murder.

281
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,090
Sushimiya

282
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,050
Ramen Korai

283
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,930
Two ramens. Thanks for waiting.

284
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,470
Why are we eating regular ramen
when we're at the market?

285
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,230
You should be grateful to
be eating ramen at all.

286
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,730
But if we'd gotten sushi, we could've
taken some back for Ran-neechan.

287
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,850
Just shut up and eat.

288
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,350
Okay...

289
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,070
It's good, but...

290
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,510
Sushimiya

291
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,840
Shut up and eat.

292
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
But sushi...
