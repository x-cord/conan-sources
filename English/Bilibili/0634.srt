1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.140
Like the fog clears.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.240
Let's see through love and crime as well.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.840
A small restaurant with a taste of the Showa Era to it.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.840
An ingenious trick in a cramped place.

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:51.865
"Scene of the Crime is a Super Cramped Shop"

9
00:01:56.865 --> 00:01:59.765
Come in! We have special discounts!

10
00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:00.965
Come in!

11
00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:02.765
"Satsuki"

12
00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:04.365
Geez.

13
00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:07.865
The main race was really a throw off.

14
00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:10.865
I didn't make it.

15
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.365
With such a dark horse like that making goal,

16
00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.865
there's no hope of winning.

17
00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:18.965
Are they all here for the Tohoto Derby too?

18
00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:22.965
A lot of derby fans hang out here on Saturdays.

19
00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:26.565
We come here directly after the race is over.

20
00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:29.265
We talk about winning, losing and the like.

21
00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:30.865
I see.

22
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:35.765
Well, you see, same here.

23
00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:38.665
Huh? May I see it?

24
00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:41.265
Sure!

25
00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:43.765
Trifecta of 1, 2, 3...

26
00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:46.465
This is today's long shot win!

27
00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:48.265
-What? -What?

28
00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:52.365
Right!

29
00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:55.565
My, sir, how wonderful.

30
00:02:55.565 --> 00:03:00.865
So, I shall foot everybody's bill tonight!

31
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:02.665
But this ticket...

32
00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.765
Ma'am! Give everyone a drink each to start!

33
00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:10.565
My, my. You sure are generous, sir!

34
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.565
It's no big deal!

35
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.565
What was that?

36
00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:23.765
Oh, this?

37
00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:26.365
It's something I devised.

38
00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:28.165
This shop is so cramped

39
00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:31.065
that using this makes moving around easier.

40
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.465
See!

41
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.465
I see.

42
00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:44.265
I sure wish I get to experience some kind of windfall, too.

43
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.765
I thought you were getting retirement pay soon?

44
00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:49.965
Retirement pay?

45
00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:53.165
No, no, it's just chicken feed.

46
00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:55.165
Hey, hey.

47
00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:59.365
Take me to Hawaii with that money, won't you?

48
00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:00.665
Come off it.

49
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:06.365
You're quite extravagant, aren't you, Mr. Richie?

50
00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:09.365
If you wish, would you like me to serve you more expensive liquor

51
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:13.365
than the cheap one you're drinking now?

52
00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:14.765
No, thank you.

53
00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:18.465
You go ahead to Shonan Hawaiian Center or something, okay?

54
00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:19.965
True.

55
00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:24.965
Since I go to that hotel every year to do my recitals,

56
00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:26.865
so it may be a good idea!

57
00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.865
There you go!

58
00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:30.865
Recitals?

59
00:04:32.365 --> 00:04:36.065
I teach Japanese dancing.

60
00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:50.265
Really, you get carried away every time you get drunk.

61
00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:52.665
Since you're doing recitals,

62
00:04:52.665 --> 00:04:56.665
I'm sure you're prospering with your classes too.

63
00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.465
No, no.

64
00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:06.665
She slipped at her recital, did a grand leg split and fell!

65
00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:09.765
There's no way that a class with a teacher like that would prosper.

66
00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:14.365
Why do you remember such useless things?

67
00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.165
Recitals my foot.

68
00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.665
You don't know where you stand.

69
00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:22.365
What did you just say? Try again!

70
00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:26.365
Are you sure you want to talk to me like that?

71
00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:29.965
Come, come, cool head.

72
00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:36.265
It looks delicious.

73
00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:37.365
Yes.

74
00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:41.365
I just happened to come into this shop when I came here.

75
00:05:43.665 --> 00:05:46.365
At present, she's like a mother and makes these dishes for me.

76
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:50.665
He came to Tokyo wanting to be a cook

77
00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:52.865
for a high class Japanese restaurant.

78
00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:56.365
But he couldn't make his dream come true, you see.

79
00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:59.765
Are you still at the fish market I introduced you to?

80
00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:02.365
Yes, thanks to you.

81
00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:05.165
You take care of people, don't you?

82
00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.965
If one wants to be a fish vendor,

83
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:09.665
you've got to have an eye for fish, don't you?

84
00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:12.465
Right, Mr. Shinohara?

85
00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:16.965
Yes, I'm learning much!

86
00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:20.565
I see. That's why he got a job at the fish market.

87
00:06:20.565 --> 00:06:25.265
By the way, why are your slacks wet?

88
00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:28.265
When I was walking down the alley a while ago...

89
00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:32.165
The shop owner accidentally splash water from a bucket on him.

90
00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:34.765
Huh? How'd you know?

91
00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:36.665
You mean she did it again?

92
00:06:36.665 --> 00:06:38.965
I mean, she doesn't care what method she uses.

93
00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:42.265
She always does that to get those who feel generous

94
00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:43.765
after winning the horse races to come to her shop.

95
00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:47.265
You keep it up and one day the heavens are going to punish you.

96
00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:50.365
Stop talking stink about her!

97
00:06:50.365 --> 00:06:53.165
She's the one who saved me when I came to Tokyo to work,

98
00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:57.165
but couldn't find anything and was at a loss what to do!

99
00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:59.565
No need to get so upset.

100
00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:03.665
I've been feeling a draft for a while now.

101
00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.165
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:07.565
This place is made of wood and tin patched together

103
00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:10.765
so wind blows in from this space.

104
00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:14.465
I'm getting chilly too, so I'm going to the bathroom.

105
00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:16.565
Come on, come on,

106
00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:18.365
the lady's going through!

107
00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:20.765
I guess we've got no choice since the shop's so cramped.

108
00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:24.265
"Satsuki"

109
00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:27.365
Now that I've stood up,

110
00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:30.565
I guess I'll go buy myself some cigarettes.

111
00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:32.065
I've got to go to the automatic teller

112
00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:33.965
to withdraw money before it closes.

113
00:07:33.965 --> 00:07:36.265
I guess I'll go get a puff too.

114
00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.865
Cigarettes, cigarettes...

115
00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:49.865
Huh?

116
00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:51.765
Was it here?

117
00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:07.665
Dad's recently drinking in this area.

118
00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:14.165
It's a wonder how they can drink with so much smoke around.

119
00:08:14.165 --> 00:08:16.065
Isn't that Pops?

120
00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:19.265
Oh, right.

121
00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.465
Taking a puff in a place like this?

122
00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:25.065
Huh? What're you all doing?

123
00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:27.465
So you've all come back.

124
00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:38.165
Ma'am!

125
00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:41.265
Ma'am, get a hold of yourself!

126
00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:43.565
Ma'am!

127
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.065
What?

128
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.870
That's more or less and rough summary of what happened.

129
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.770
A stab through the chest is the cause of death.

130
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.370
The name Satsuki was carved on the handle of the knife

131
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.170
that is the murder weapon.

132
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.770
It seems that all the knives that the owner

133
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.070
used at this shop had the same name carved on the handles.

134
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.770
There were no signs of things being taken from the shop.

135
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.470
Robbery seems very unlikely.

136
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.870
And, what brings you here, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.770
Yes, sir. I won by a long shot,

138
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.970
so I was treating the customers here.

139
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.270
You seemed to be having a lot of fun.

140
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.170
No, not really.

141
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.670
And, when the crime occurred all of us including me,

142
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.670
were all outside the shop.

143
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.170
I see. Only the owner was in the shop alone.

144
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.170
And it's not possible to look inside from outside

145
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.670
since the window is smoked.

146
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.670
Yes.

147
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:52.270
So it means that only the customers knew she was alone.

148
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.070
So while everybody else was outside,

149
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.070
one of the customers killed her.

150
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.970
Okay, let's hear them out then.

151
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.970
What do you mean you want to hear us out?

152
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.470
Judging from the circumstances,

153
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:14.070
it's highly likely that one of you is the culprit.

154
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.370
Don't be ridiculous!

155
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.070
So, please tell us where and what you were doing

156
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.970
during the 5 minutes that the incident took place.

157
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.170
Come to think of it, back then...

158
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.970
After everyone came out of the shop,

159
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.170
Ms. Oogi didn't come out from the shop for a while.

160
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.970
Ms. Oogi could've been waiting for a chance

161
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.070
to be alone with the owner.

162
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.770
Why would I want to do something like that?

163
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.670
Don't tell me that you borrowed money from the owner

164
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.470
because your classroom was about to go broke?

165
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.970
How dare you!

166
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.270
The owner was rumored

167
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.570
for being mellow like Buddha when lending money,

168
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.870
but was said to turn into a devil

169
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.070
when she came to collect what she lent back.

170
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.170
I see.

171
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.670
Is it true that you borrowed money from the owner?

172
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.870
Yes.

173
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.870
She's been bugging me almost every day recently

174
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.370
demanding to have her money back.

175
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.070
Just today too, when I was about to leave the shop,

176
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.470
she closed in on me demanding to have me pay her back right away.

177
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.670
So, you were outraged, took the knife on the counter and...

178
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.670
No! Our argument was getting nowhere, so I left!

179
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.370
But, since she ended up like that...

180
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.570
I found it hard to come out and say anything about it!

181
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.870
Huh?

182
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.470
The sleeve of this person is wet.

183
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.170
Huh?

184
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.370
I see!

185
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.670
If I remember correctly, you're left-handed, right?

186
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.070
You used your left hand when you drank wine,

187
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.870
used your fan

188
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.170
or put the thumb tack back on!

189
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.570
Isn't your sleeve wet because you went to the restroom

190
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.270
and washed off the blood that splattered on you

191
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.070
when you stabbed the owner?

192
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.870
The faucet of the restroom was broken

193
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.970
and water came gushing out, that's all!

194
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.870
Just to be sure, have forensics check for luminol reaction.

195
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.470
Yes, sir. Come this way, please.

196
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.270
By the way, Mr. Nakamura.

197
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.370
What is it?

198
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.070
After saying that you were going to buy cigarettes and left the shop,

199
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.070
you turned right at the forked alley.

200
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.370
By the way, when you returned,

201
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.370
you came from the opposite direction, right?

202
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.970
The cigarette vending machine here and yet,

203
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.570
why did you return from the opposite side?

204
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.770
That's because the cigarettes of the vending machine were sold out

205
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.970
so I went to the cigarette shop on the main road.

206
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.170
Inspector!

207
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.770
I found the owner's notebook.

208
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.770
There's a monthly deposit of 100,000 made

209
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.570
under the name of Nakamura.

210
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.570
That amount's too large to be just for drinking.

211
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.570
Can you explain what this money is for?

212
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.870
Well, that's...

213
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.370
The owner had a hold of something I didn't want anybody to know.

214
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.070
Secret?

215
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.370
She was blackmailing me saying that

216
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.670
she would disclose to my company that I embezzled money

217
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.970
and was spending it on horse racing.

218
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.470
But I didn't do it!

219
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.970
I really went to the cigarette shop on the main street!

220
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.070
By the way, Mr. Shinohara.

221
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.170
Yes?

222
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.170
In her notes here, your name is mentioned here and there

223
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.170
and things like mackerel and squids are written.

224
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.170
Can you explain this?

225
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.070
I'm working part-time at the fish market,

226
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.570
so I used to take orders from her off and on.

227
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.570
Isn't it a record of the orders?

228
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.670
What were you doing during the 5 minutes that you left the shop?

229
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.470
Since I didn't have any cash on me,

230
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.870
I went to withdraw money from the automatic teller nearby.

231
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.270
I've got the breakdown sheet with me, too.

232
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.770
Here it is.

233
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.270
There's no mistake about the time either.

234
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.370
After leaving the shop,

235
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.270
Mr. Shinohara walked towards the main street.

236
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.170
The automatic teller is here,

237
00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.270
so it would be impossible for him to sneak back to the shop.

238
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.570
Given that there are no inconsistencies on his ATM receipt...

239
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.670
It seems impossible for him to have killed her.

240
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.270
Pops said that he treated everybody.

241
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.970
All the knives that are inside the stand are Japanese knives.

242
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.270
This is...

243
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.670
Juice?

244
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.170
If I remember correctly, the owner was a non-drinker.

245
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.970
Brandy glass.

246
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.370
It hasn't been used yet.

247
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.470
The brandy bottle.

248
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.670
I see. I got it.

249
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.470
The trick of this case.

250
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.470
Hey, hey. Snoozing off during investigations?

251
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.770
I guess I'll attach a compact speaker on him now then.

252
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.770
Conan!

253
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.570
Don't go off on your own.

254
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.370
-Okay. -Inspector Megure.

255
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.870
As a result of the test performed by forensics,

256
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.370
no luminol reaction was found on Mr. Oogi's clothes.

257
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.070
I also confirmed with the cigarette vendor on the main street

258
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.170
and he testified that Mr. Nakamura

259
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.770
did in fact come to make the purchase.

260
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.570
I guess I don't have to use it today.

261
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.770
Okay, everyone.

262
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.770
We'd like to hear more in detail at the station.

263
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.870
Inspector, you don't need to do that.

264
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.970
I will solve the case right here this minute.

265
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.970
-What? -What?

266
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.670
Mr. Mouri, did you figure out who the culprit is?

267
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.170
Yes!

268
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.270
The brandy glass that was placed on the cutting board

269
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.470
told me who the culprit is!

270
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.570
Huh? Brandy?

271
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.670
Please give me a glass too, Inspector!

272
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.170
Oh no! He woke up!

273
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.670
Are you all right?

274
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.370
I'm fine.

275
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.570
Please look on top the counter of the shop.

276
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.370
Mr. Oogi had wine.

277
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.970
Mr. Nakamura had Japanese sake.

278
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.470
I had beer and Mr. Shinohara had sour.

279
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.470
And on the cutting board,

280
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.770
there're the glass cup of juice that the owner was drinking

281
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.270
and a still unused brandy glass.

282
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.570
So, what about it?

283
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.270
Who on earth did she take the brandy out for?

284
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.770
There was no customer who ordered brandy

285
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.570
before we left the shop.

286
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.370
It sure is strange.

287
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.870
Please look at the very top of the shelf.

288
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.370
The brandy bottle on the shelf

289
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.770
has been moved a bit, hasn't it?

290
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.470
It's most likely that the culprit after leaving the shop,

291
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.770
called the owner

292
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.570
and ordered the expensive brandy that was on the very top shelf.

293
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:21.970
He probably lied and told her that

294
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.670
I would be treating everyone to that expensive brandy or something.

295
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.170
In order for the shop owner who is short, to get the brandy bottle,

296
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.170
she would have to tiptoe placing her body

297
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.170
close against the shelf and the wall.

298
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.870
The culprit with all this in mind

299
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.570
stuck a knife through the space in the wall.

300
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.970
He stuck the knife from outside the shop?

301
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.170
In back of the shop,

302
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.170
there's a space under the eaves where one person can pass through.

303
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.470
And in the patched wall made of wooden boards

304
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.170
and tin plates there are narrow spaces.

305
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.670
The culprit made the phone call from under the eaves

306
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.270
and lured the owner to come over to the wall.

307
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.770
Then, he stuck the knife through the space and killed her.

308
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.570
He probably stole the knife beforehand from the shop.

309
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.870
But when I found the owner,

310
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.270
she was facing the front of the counter face down.

311
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.870
Right. If she was stabbed near the wall,

312
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.770
she wouldn't fall that way, would she?

313
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.670
The chair that the owner was using was a chair that spins

314
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.070
in a cramped shop.

315
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.670
Ironically, just as the shop owner fell,

316
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.370
the chair spun round.

317
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.770
That's why she fell facing forward.

318
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.970
But a knife has a handle,

319
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.770
so I don't think it'll go through the space in the wall.

320
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.470
How about it, Officer Takagi?

321
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.670
Yes, sir. The handle would get stuck.

322
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.870
What is there was no handle on the knife?

323
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.270
What?

324
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.770
The handles of western knives

325
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.070
used to prepare western food are stuck together using screws.

326
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.270
But the handles of Japanese knives are easily removable

327
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.370
because all that needs to be done is to stick the blade into the handle.

328
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.870
Inspector! It's just as Mr. Mouri says.

329
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.870
Which means...

330
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.470
The culprit wanted us to find the body,

331
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.570
while he went into the counter under the pretense of being worried.

332
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.170
Then he put the handle back onto the blade

333
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.070
and carried the owner up.

334
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.470
No way...

335
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.170
No joke?

336
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.670
Yes.

337
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.970
The only one who could've carried out

338
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.070
the trick of using the removable handle of the knife

339
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.970
was the one who was the first to run over to her.

340
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.070
It's you, Mr. Shinohara.

341
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.270
But I was over at the automatic teller machine.

342
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.670
Right, he has an alibi.

343
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.170
No.

344
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.570
If he were to commit the crime from the back of the shop,

345
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.970
the automatic teller machine is quite close.

346
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.070
It wouldn't serve as alibi.

347
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.870
Being that he wanted to become a cook

348
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.770
for a high class Japanese restaurant...

349
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.270
He would've known that

350
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.670
the handle of the Japanese knife was removable.

351
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.870
Do you have definite proof that I did it?

352
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.170
The envelope that you had

353
00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.870
the paper of transaction details on that you showed us

354
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.170
was soiled, wasn't it?

355
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.470
That's rust from steel, isn't it?

356
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.670
When you committed the crime,

357
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.670
you were probably holding the blade without the handle on it

358
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.270
with a handkerchief wrapped around it.

359
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.870
Therefore, the steel rust from the steel adhered to your handkerchief.

360
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.970
Unaware of this, you put the handkerchief

361
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.170
in the same pocket that the envelope was inside,

362
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.070
so the steel rust rubbed off on the envelope.

363
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.670
If we check the rust of the tin and that on the envelope,

364
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.470
I'm sure they will match.

365
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.270
But, why?

366
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.570
Wasn't she the one who helped you?

367
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.270
Wrong!

368
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.870
The reason she put on a nice front

369
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.770
and introduced me to the fish market

370
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.170
was to make me steal stuff from there!

371
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.870
What?

372
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.770
At first, all she demanded was damaged or left-over stuff.

373
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.670
But her demands started escalating.

374
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.770
And recently, she would constantly bug me to get her

375
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.970
expensive things such as sea urchins, salmon roe, etc.

376
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.070
I couldn't take it anymore!

377
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.370
And when I told her I was quitting the job...

378
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.970
If you quit, I'm going to report everything you did till now.

379
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.570
If I do that, you'll be jailed for theft.

380
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.870
But you're the one who told me to do it.

381
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.370
Well...

382
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.470
Just where do you have proof that I told you to it?

383
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.670
You're the only one who'll be arrested.

384
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.070
Well, you probably can't become a Japanese cook either,

385
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.570
so maybe it's not all that bad, is it?

386
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.670
I just couldn't give up my dream

387
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.770
of becoming a cook of Japanese cuisine.

388
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.070
That's why!

389
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.370
But you used the knife that is supposed to be

390
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.970
the life of a cook of Japanese cuisine

391
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.170
to commit murder.

392
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.170
I don't think you're qualified

393
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.570
to be a cook of Japanese cuisine anymore, are you?

394
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:54.270
"Satsuki"

395
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.970
Huh?

396
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.370
Come to think of it,

397
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.070
didn't Dad say he won by a long shot?

398
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.570
Huh? These horse racing tickets are all 100 yen.

399
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.470
Even if I won by a long shot,

400
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.370
it's not much being that the tickets are all 100 yen.

401
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.970
And yet, I showed off and treated everybody,

402
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.970
now it's going to take me a long time to earn what I spent.

403
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.070
-What? -Forgive me!

404
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.870
-I won't forgive you! Wait up! -Pretty please!

405
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.270
I don't think it'll take too long to get him.
