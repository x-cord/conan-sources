00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.140
"Ryujiro Uenmatsu (59)" -How is it, Ms. Kobayashi?

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.940
Have you made up your mind?

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.740
Yes, since it's a rare opportunity,

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.140
I plan to take on the duty of lay judge if I am chosen.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.540
I see... if the time comes around,

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.040
please don't worry about your classes

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.440
and complete your role as a lay judge to your heart's content.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.240
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.740
Is this a new picture?

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.540
It was donated by the chairman of the PTA.

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.140
It's a pretty unusual picture, isn't it?

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040
If you will excuse me...

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.440
I'll be on my way.

Ms. Kobayashi!

16
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.440
Is it true that you were chosen to be a lay judge?

17
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.240
Why do you know about it?

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.340
From our Youth Detective Squad network!

19
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.840
What kind of case is the hearing for?

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.540
There's this thing called duty of confidentiality,

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.040
and you're not allowed to talk about the case!

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.340
Just a little bit won't hurt, will it?

23
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.240
Just to us, the Youth Detective Squad!

24
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.440
I said no, and I mean no.

25
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
-Wait Ms. Kobayashi! -Just tell us!

26
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.540
I wonder if Ms. Kobayashi's capable of serving as a lay judge?

27
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440
We should worry about it after she's chosen.

28
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.540
True.

29
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.740
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

30
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.940
Tears are start of all dramas.

31
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.040
Ms. Kobayashi becomes a lay judge?

32
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.940
What are the contents of this case of concern?

33
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.440

The trial will begin soon.

39
00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:21.702
But, are you still determined to plead not guilty?

40
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:25.702
"Toshio Iwamatsu (35)" -Yeah! I really didn't do it!

41
00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:29.402
Then why did you confess to the crime?

42
00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:32.402
I told the police that I didn't do it, either!

43
00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:36.002
But, I was pressed to confess because there was blood on my clothes.

44
00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:37.602
You mean the blood of the victim

45
00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:41.002
that was on your clothes at the time you were arrested?

46
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:46.202
Yeah... besides the hair and other stuff too.

47
00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:49.902
The hair and footprints that were left behind at the scene of the crime.

48
00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:52.702
They said they had all the evidence necessary so...

49
00:03:52.702 --> 00:03:55.702
That's why you signed the written confession form?

50
00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:59.302
But, all I did was break into the house.

51
00:04:18.802 --> 00:04:22.802
That guy was already dead back then!

52
00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:23.902
That guy?

53
00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:29.402
You just called the victim, Mr. Ishigaki "that guy",

54
00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.102
but did you know him from before?

55
00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:36.102
No... of course not...

59
00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:46.302
Like I'm telling you! I didn't do it!

Hello, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

61
00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:56.702

62
00:04:56.702 --> 00:05:01.002
I heard that you accepted to act as Toshio Iwamatsu's attorney.

63
00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.602
Yes. I just went to see him.

Yes, I was chosen!

72
00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:42.402
Yes, so just as we talked about it the other day,

73
00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:44.502
please see that my classes are taken care of...

74

I've got to go listen to explanation regarding the hearing so, bye.

85
00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:22.202
Yes, since you're the first lay judge

87
00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:25.702

95
00:06:47.902 --> 00:06:50.402
What? Don't tell me that...

96
00:06:50.402 --> 00:06:51.802
It's the first time

97
00:06:51.802 --> 00:06:54.302

98
00:06:54.302 --> 00:06:57.902
We came to watch because we were worried.

100
00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.602

101
00:07:02.602 --> 00:07:07.002

I guess this is a hearing that you wouldn't want to miss at all costs.

106
00:07:19.102 --> 00:07:20.602
Why not go with them?

107
00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:23.602

Will the defendant please step forward.

112
00:08:09.702 --> 00:08:13.702
Prosecutor, please read the bill of indictment.

Yes, your honor.

The defendant Toshio Iwamatsu

115
00:08:18.002 --> 00:08:22.302
broke into a residence located on 4-5 Akebono-cho,

116
00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:24.902
by cracking the window of the study of Mr. Tadashi Ishigaki,

117
00:08:24.902 --> 00:08:27.502
the president of a real estate company, who owns the residence.

118
00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:29.402
While he was rummaging the house,

119
00:08:29.402 --> 00:08:32.602
Mr. Ishigaki who came home and found him, confronted him.

120
00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:34.202
Then Iwamatsu who had a knife on him

121
00:08:34.202 --> 00:08:36.502
-stabbed the victim in the stomach. -Objection!

122
00:08:37.802 --> 00:08:40.602
You say he possessed a knife,

123
00:08:40.602 --> 00:08:42.702
but was the murder weapon specified?

124
00:08:42.702 --> 00:08:46.202
No, it hasn't been found yet.

125
00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:49.502
Please delete that point.

126
00:08:49.502 --> 00:08:50.702
Agreed.

127
00:08:53.102 --> 00:08:54.802
Just as expected of mom.

128
00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:57.802
Not so fast, it's just started.

129
00:08:57.802 --> 00:09:01.502
The whereabouts of the murder weapon is unknown.

130
00:09:01.502 --> 00:09:03.002
The defendant with blood on his clothes

131
00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:07.302
was found near the scene of the crime.

132
00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:13.602
And as a result of interrogation,

133
00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:15.902
he confessed to committing the crime.

134
00:09:15.902 --> 00:09:18.002
The charges and applicable penal statute is homicide,

135
00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:22.102
Criminal Law Article 199.

136
00:09:24.302 --> 00:09:26.902
Does the defendant agree to the charges?

137
00:09:31.402 --> 00:09:34.402
I didn't do it! I'm innocent!

138
00:09:39.802 --> 00:09:42.202
What is your opinion, attorney?

139
00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.702
I plead not guilty on behalf of the defendant

140
00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:46.802
with regard to the murder charge.

141
00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:47.902
Not guilty...

142
00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:57.402
The court will now proceed to evidence examination.

143
00:09:57.402 --> 00:10:00.902
First, may I draw your attention to the autopsy report?

144
00:10:00.902 --> 00:10:02.402
Lay judges,

145
00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:05.802
please confirm with the monitor display right in front of you.

146
00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:12.602
What could it be?

147
00:10:12.602 --> 00:10:15.002
I guess the corpse or something is being displayed.

148
00:10:15.002 --> 00:10:16.102
What?

149
00:10:16.102 --> 00:10:18.802
I wonder if Ms. Kobayashi's going to be okay.

150
00:10:18.802 --> 00:10:21.702
It may be tough for lay citizens,

151
00:10:21.702 --> 00:10:25.302
but it is the work of the lay judges to perceive the facts.

152
00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:29.502
The cause of death is exsanguinations

153
00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:31.202
through stab wounds in the abdomen.

154
00:10:31.202 --> 00:10:34.002
The murder weapon is thought to be a sharp object.

155
00:10:34.002 --> 00:10:37.002
The blade seems to be approximately 15 centimetres.

156
00:10:39.102 --> 00:10:42.302
We shall now proceed to witness testimony.

157
00:10:43.302 --> 00:10:46.402
"Sachie Hara (66)"

158
00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:51.702
You're the housekeeper hired at the victim's residence, correct?

159
00:10:51.702 --> 00:10:55.302
Yes. I've worked for five years already.

160
00:10:55.302 --> 00:10:58.502
Please tell us about the time the incident occurred.

161
00:10:59.902 --> 00:11:04.902
I was cleaning the room on the second floor like always that day.

162
00:11:04.902 --> 00:11:09.102
Then, I thought I heard noise from downstairs.

163
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.002
Since Mr. Ishigaki told me that

164
00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:13.402
he would be eating out after playing golf,

165
00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:15.702
I thought I just imagined hearing something.

166
00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:18.502
I finished cleaning and went downstairs.

167
00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:24.802
Are you back?

168
00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:27.002
I wonder why the window's open.

169
00:11:34.502 --> 00:11:36.002
Sir?

170
00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:44.802
That'll be all.

171
00:11:46.202 --> 00:11:50.302
Any questions from the defense?

172
00:11:50.302 --> 00:11:52.902
When you went to the room where the crime was committed,

173
00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:55.902
you didn't see the culprit anywhere in sight, is that correct?

174
00:11:55.902 --> 00:12:00.502
No, I just saw Mr. Ishigaki bleeding and lying on the floor.

175
00:12:02.202 --> 00:12:04.002
The lay judges should take note that

176
00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:07.002
the witness is merely the primary discoverer,

177
00:12:07.002 --> 00:12:09.302
and that she did not see the defendant

178
00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:12.402
and the victim confronting each other

179
00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:14.902
as the prosecutor had just read off.

180
00:12:19.302 --> 00:12:22.502
"Toru Tsukano (46)"

181
00:12:22.502 --> 00:12:25.802
You're the younger brother of the late wife

182
00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:27.102
of the victim, correct?

183
00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:32.302
Yes. I worked under Mr. Ishigaki as managing director.

184
00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:34.802
It seems that on that particular day you visited him about work

185
00:12:34.802 --> 00:12:37.302
and encountered that incident, correct?

186
00:12:37.302 --> 00:12:38.902
Regarding transactions,

187
00:12:38.902 --> 00:12:41.902
we needed the president to settle the accounts immediately, you see.

188
00:12:43.902 --> 00:12:46.102
What's wrong, Ms. Hara?

189
00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:49.602
Did something happen?

190
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.802
Mr. Tsukano! Mr. Ishigaki's...

191
00:12:52.802 --> 00:12:54.102
President...

192
00:12:56.102 --> 00:12:57.202
President!

193
00:13:02.302 --> 00:13:04.202
Ms. Hara, please call an ambulance right away!

194
00:13:04.202 --> 00:13:05.302
Yes, sir!

195
00:13:08.602 --> 00:13:11.202
Lay judges, after the death of my older sister,

196
00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:13.002
the president was the only family member

197
00:13:13.002 --> 00:13:16.002
that I had left that I could rely on.

198
00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:18.202
Please carry out the maximum penalty

199
00:13:18.202 --> 00:13:20.602
to the one who took his life.

200
00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:30.102
Lay judges, if you have any doubts or questions,

201
00:13:30.102 --> 00:13:32.502
please do not hesitate to ask.

202
00:13:32.502 --> 00:13:35.102
Then, if you will allow me...

203
00:13:35.102 --> 00:13:36.702
Go ahead.

204
00:13:36.702 --> 00:13:39.302
I hear that the murder weapon hasn't been found yet,

205
00:13:39.302 --> 00:13:43.102
but does that mean that the culprit fled along with it?

206
00:13:43.102 --> 00:13:44.602
That is what we thought too,

207
00:13:44.602 --> 00:13:46.102
so we've been trying to track down the culprit

208
00:13:46.102 --> 00:13:47.802
based on possible escape routes,

209
00:13:47.802 --> 00:13:49.902
but we haven't come up with anything yet.

210
00:13:50.802 --> 00:13:53.702
The defendant was arrested 20 minutes

211
00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:55.902
after he was reported to the police.

212
00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:57.702
From the Ishigaki residence which is the scene of the crime

213
00:13:57.702 --> 00:13:58.802
to the place the defendant was arrested,

214
00:13:58.802 --> 00:14:01.702
even if he were to run at top speed, it would take more than 15 minutes.

215
00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:04.702
Thus, it is unthinkable that the defendant had any extra time

216
00:14:04.702 --> 00:14:06.802
to get rid of the murder weapon

217
00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:08.802
outside the investigation area of the police.

218
00:14:09.802 --> 00:14:13.002
Then, where is the murder's weapon?

219
00:14:13.002 --> 00:14:15.902
That's a tough one for Madonna.

220
00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:19.102
It's a tie for now.

221
00:14:19.102 --> 00:14:21.602
What you're seeing now is the study

222
00:14:21.602 --> 00:14:24.702
where the crime was committed.

223
00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:26.702
The culprit snuck in from the window,

224
00:14:26.702 --> 00:14:28.402
and was rummaging through the room

225
00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:30.202
when the victim returned home and found him...

226
00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.802
Oh my...

227
00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.002
What is it?

228
00:14:43.602 --> 00:14:45.502
If you are in doubt of anything,

229
00:14:45.502 --> 00:14:47.302
please do not hesitate and ask.

230
00:14:47.302 --> 00:14:49.802
Yes, sir, then...

231
00:14:49.802 --> 00:14:50.902
Yes!

232
00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:55.202
Ms. Kobayashi, you don't need to raise your hand.

233
00:14:57.002 --> 00:14:58.002
Go ahead.

234
00:14:58.002 --> 00:15:02.702
The picture in the room, could it be that it's upside down?

235
00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:03.902
The picture?

236
00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:07.802
Yes. The same picture was decorated in the principal's room too.

237
00:15:07.802 --> 00:15:09.202
So, perhaps...

238
00:15:09.202 --> 00:15:13.902
It's true it's hard to tell which way is up with that picture.

239
00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:17.102
What does that have to do with the case, though?

240
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:21.502
There has been no report of the picture

241
00:15:21.502 --> 00:15:24.202
being moved during investigation.

242
00:15:26.202 --> 00:15:28.002
The defendant doesn't seem to have any recollection

243
00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:30.102
whatsoever of the picture either.

244
00:15:30.102 --> 00:15:32.702
What does it matter?

245
00:15:32.702 --> 00:15:33.802
What?

246
00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:37.802
Right, who cares about such an incomprehensible picture?

247
00:15:37.802 --> 00:15:40.502
Let's say that it is as you say,

248
00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:43.002
what does that have to do with this case?

249
00:15:43.002 --> 00:15:46.602
I'm sorry. It's okay about the picture already.

250
00:15:46.602 --> 00:15:49.002
Please continue the hearing.

251
00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.802
The picture is upside down?

252
00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:02.149
Although there are disadvantageous evidence against the defendant,

253
00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:04.649
Madonna seems to be having a tough time getting her point across.

254
00:16:04.649 --> 00:16:08.649
I guess Ms. Kisaki is much too difficult to take on.

255
00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:11.649
Mom's hanging in there, isn't she?

256
00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:13.649
For today, I guess.

257
00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:15.549
But, who knows if Madonna is the type

258
00:16:15.549 --> 00:16:17.749
to shrink away from something like this.

259
00:16:19.349 --> 00:16:23.549
Conan, are you bothered about Ms. Kobayashi's question?

260
00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.349
If what Ms. Kobayashi said is true,

261
00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:29.449
I thought that maybe somebody could've turned the picture upside down.

262
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:32.249
It could be that Ms. Kobayashi's mistaken, right?

263
00:16:32.249 --> 00:16:33.949
I'm sure she's nervous too

264
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:35.649
because she's acting as a lay judge for the first time too.

265
00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:37.649
I guess so.

266
00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:39.849
If the picture really is upside down,

267
00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:42.249
there should be a reason for why it's the way it is.

268
00:16:45.049 --> 00:16:46.449
Shall we try going?

269
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.049
I guess it's over here.

270
00:16:49.049 --> 00:16:51.949
They seem to have a guest over.

271
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:54.949
Maybe we should wait until mom gets here?

272
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:57.449
No way, who cares?

273
00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:02.049
This is the spot where he collapsed, right?

274
00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:04.749
My... what brings the great detective over here?

275
00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:06.749
Did Attorney Kisaki still want something?

276
00:17:06.749 --> 00:17:10.649
No, I've just come to check out the scene of the crime involving the case.

277
00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:12.249
Are we intruding on you?

278
00:17:12.249 --> 00:17:13.649
Be my guest.

279
00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:17.749
I was only confirming some things for the next hearing.

280
00:17:17.749 --> 00:17:22.349
Have you found anything that can turn the case over in your favor?

281
00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.849
Did you already check the picture?

282
00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.449
Picture?

283
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:28.349
One of the lay judges mentioned it, didn't she?

284
00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.349
It's about that picture, right?

285
00:17:31.349 --> 00:17:34.249
She mentioned something about the picture being upside down but...

286
00:17:34.249 --> 00:17:36.549
Ran, how is it when compared to the picture

287
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:38.449
you were checking on the internet a while ago?

288
00:17:41.149 --> 00:17:43.749
No doubt about it. Just as Ms. Kobayashi pointed out,

289
00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:45.249
the picture is upside-down.

290
00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:49.149
So, what does that have to do with the case?

291
00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:51.249
The owner of the picture wouldn't put the picture

292
00:17:51.249 --> 00:17:53.249
on the wall upside down, would he?

293
00:17:53.249 --> 00:17:57.649
So exactly who hang it upside-down?

294
00:17:57.649 --> 00:17:58.749
Take the picture down!

295
00:17:58.749 --> 00:17:59.749
Yes!

296
00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:07.049
It was put on the wall with magnet.

297
00:18:08.349 --> 00:18:11.049
Don't tell me that this is...

298
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.049
blood?

299
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.949
It couldn't be.

300
00:18:13.949 --> 00:18:15.649
I can see if it were on the outside,

301
00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:18.249
but why would there be blood stains on the inside?

302
00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:21.449
Maybe somebody with bloody hands touched it.

303
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:26.449
An IOU?

304
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:29.749
The borrower's signed acknowledgement of the agreement and a bill?

305
00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:34.449
I see, so the picture frame was being used as a hidden safe.

306
00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:37.249
This is...

307
00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:40.649
An IOU amounting to three million yen?

308
00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:42.349
"Iwamatsu Toshio"

309
00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:44.749
The borrower is Iwamatsu?

310
00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.549
Isn't that the defendant's name?

311
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:50.249
If the defendant broke into the house

312
00:18:50.249 --> 00:18:53.349
to search for this IOU to begin with...

313
00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:56.449
We've found more than vital evidence.

314
00:18:57.449 --> 00:18:59.649
I've heard that the president,

315
00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:01.949
other than his main line of work,

316
00:19:01.949 --> 00:19:06.349
was engaged in questionable monetary dealings behind the scenes.

317
00:19:06.349 --> 00:19:09.449
Do you knew about this?

318
00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.649
The president was very secretive about that case,

319
00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:13.549
so I don't think he told anyone about it.

320
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:18.549
Moreover, I found out for the first time myself,

321
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:21.249
that such a thing was hidden behind the picture.

322
00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:23.249
Will you get the details from him over there?

323
00:19:23.249 --> 00:19:24.249
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:19:25.949 --> 00:19:27.049
Please come with me.

325
00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:31.749
I've got to tell mom about this.

326
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:35.049
Ms. Hara, how about you?

327
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.949
I knew nothing what so ever about the picture too.

328
00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:39.349
If the defendant was the one

329
00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:40.749
who put the picture back on the wall upside down,

330
00:19:40.749 --> 00:19:44.249
I wonder why he didn't take the IOU and all?

331
00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:45.449
That's probably because

332
00:19:45.449 --> 00:19:48.449
when he removed the picture and was about to check it,

333
00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:51.349
he heard the housekeeper coming down from upstairs,

334
00:19:51.349 --> 00:19:54.549
so hastily put the picture back on the wall upside down and fled.

335
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:56.349
Why would he go through the trouble of putting it back on the wall

336
00:19:56.349 --> 00:19:58.749
when he could just easily flee together picture and all?

337
00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:02.949
Because he stabbed somebody, was delirious,

338
00:20:02.949 --> 00:20:07.549
and couldn't think clearly! Do you understand?

339
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:09.449
Something's not right.

340
00:20:09.449 --> 00:20:11.749
I'm sure that anything being hidden behind the picture

341
00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:13.749
would've had to be a secret.

342
00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:15.949
Then, why did the culprit know about it?

343
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:24.749
Wasn't there a flower vase on top here?

344
00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:26.349
What?

345
00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:27.649
A flower vase?

346
00:20:27.649 --> 00:20:30.649
See, because although there's a vase mat here,

347
00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:33.049
there's no flower vase on it.

348
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:34.649
True.

349
00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:35.649
The surrounding area besides

350
00:20:35.649 --> 00:20:37.749
where the flower vase must've been is discolored.

351
00:20:40.649 --> 00:20:42.649
Do you know something, Ms. Housekeeper?

352
00:20:42.649 --> 00:20:44.949
What?

353
00:20:44.949 --> 00:20:49.549
It was a flower vase that Mrs. Ishigaki used to use.

354
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:51.149
It was placed there even after she passed away,

355
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:54.149
but recently Mr. Ishigaki got rid of it.

356
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:55.449
Is that so?

357
00:20:55.449 --> 00:20:57.749
I thought that it dropped and cracked

358
00:20:57.749 --> 00:21:00.149
when he got into a struggle with the culprit or something.

359
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:01.949
Even during investigation of the scene of the crime,

360
00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:04.149
no cracked fragments of a flower vase came up.

361
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:05.949
But, Conan, was that your name?

362
00:21:05.949 --> 00:21:09.149
You've really got a keen sense of observation, I should say.

363
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:11.849
He always notices the trivial things.

364
00:21:11.849 --> 00:21:14.549
If you will excuse me, then.

365
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:16.149
Strange.

366
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:17.649
The way the woman looked really flustered

367
00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:19.749
when I asked about the flower vase.

368
00:21:19.749 --> 00:21:21.249
She must know something.

369
00:21:25.949 --> 00:21:28.649
I hear you found Mr. Iwamatsu's IOU.

370
00:21:28.649 --> 00:21:34.149
It seems that the defendant had a motive for killing the victim.

371
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:38.549
So, he didn't randomly break in to the house simply to steal?

372
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:43.549
I will submit it as crucial evidence at the next hearing.

373
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:49.349
Wouldn't it be better if you just withdraw

374
00:21:49.349 --> 00:21:53.149
the not guilty plea and enter a plea bargain instead?

375
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:55.649
I don't need you to worry about

376
00:21:55.649 --> 00:21:59.149
how I carry on my defense strategies.

377
00:21:59.149 --> 00:22:03.349
Why do I care if you embarrass yourself in front of the lay judges?

378
00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:05.049
Mom, are you going to be all right?

379
00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:06.449
I'll be fine, Ran.

380
00:22:06.449 --> 00:22:09.349
The more disadvantageous the case seems to be,

381
00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:12.249
the more fired up I get, okay?

382
00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:16.149
In order to get out of this fix,

383
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:18.949
the truth about this case has to be disclosed.

384
00:22:18.949 --> 00:22:22.149
And, I'm sure that the key are the upside down picture

385
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:24.849
and whereabouts of the lost flower vase!

386
00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:46.249
"Next Episode"

387
00:23:46.249 --> 00:23:48.049
Was the weapon found?

388
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:50.749
This may be the first time

389
00:23:50.749 --> 00:23:52.849
Ms. Kisaki who's had a successions of victories

390
00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:54.649
will experience losing a case.

391
00:23:55.949 --> 00:23:58.949
That's person's actually not the culprit.

392
00:23:58.949 --> 00:24:00.049
What?

393
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:02.349
Who said so?

394
00:24:02.349 --> 00:24:04.149
Show time, dad!

395
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:06.849
Okay, off I go!

396
00:24:06.849 --> 00:24:09.049
We're counting on you, Pops!

397
00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:11.149
Next Conan,

398
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:15.287
"Courtroom Confrontation IV Lay Judge Sumiko Kobayashi (Part 2)"

399
00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:18.676
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:18.676 --> 00:24:20.776
"Flower Vase"

401
00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:22.176
I dropped the flower vase!

402
00:24:22.176 --> 00:24:24.176
-What? -Flippity flop.

403
00:24:24.176 --> 00:24:25.130
What?
