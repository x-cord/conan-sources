1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.740
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.940
Today's stage is an ordinary condo.

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.740
The Youth Detective Squad solves the case with their wits!

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.640
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.790
"The Great Search-Nine Door"

10
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.690
I wish I could find something interesting to do.

11
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.790
The world is full of cases to be solved and yet...

12
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.190
It's strange that nothing's happening only around us, yeah.

13
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.090
Nothing's strange about it.

14
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.490
That's the way it should be.

15
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.690
What's that?

16
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.090
It's a ring.

17
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.190
I wonder where it came flying from.

18
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.890
There was nobody on this side.

19
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.190
I think somebody threw it from the window of this condo.

20
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.090
Huh?

21
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.990
All the windows are closed.

22
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.890
A prank?

23
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.090
Hey, watch it!

24
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.190
But,

25
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.890
I wonder why it's on something like this.

26
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.790
It's a 'S' shaped hook.

27
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.990
There's one here too.

28
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.090
Maybe that hook was also attached to the ring

29
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.790
but came off when it fell to the ground.

30
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.790
Huh?

31
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.190
Wait a minute.

32
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.490
What's up?

33
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.890
Hey, hey, don't tell me...

34
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.290
Look.

35
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.190
Doesn't this look like a word?

36
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.190
SOS?

37
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.190
Yes. This ring and 'S' shaped hooks

38
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.390
are an SOS sign that somebody is sending us.

39
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.290
I expected them to say that.

40
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.690
If so, it must be a woman.

41
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.690
Huh?

42
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.090
There is lipstick on the hook.

43
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.090
She's right. There's lipstick on it.

44
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.290
Hey, hey, you're getting carried away.

45
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.790
Mitsuhiko, will you show me the ring?

46
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.890
This is a wedding ring.

47
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.890
See, M to A.

48
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.090
1999 March 21 is carved on it.

49
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.890
This means that the ring was sent from somebody

50
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.090
with the initial M to someone with the initial A.

51
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.390
And that they were married on March 21, 1999.

52
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.590
Wow, it's amazing that you can tell, Ayumi.

53
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.690
My parents' ring has the same thing carved on it.

54
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.390
So this ring is one that the woman was wearing.

55
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.990
Her husband's initial is M and her initial is A.

56
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.390
Will you lend it to me?

57
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.590
The size of this ring is about 11.

58
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.390
Women regularly take sizes 7 to 9,

59
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.190
so this woman must have pretty fat fingers.

60
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.790
Listen, you guys.

61
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.290
There's no mistake about it.

62
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.090
The one who sent out an SOS...

63
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.690
is somewhere on the 1st to the 9th floor of this condo,

64
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.290
and is for some reason is rendered immobile.

65
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.090
Could it be an accident or...

66
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.790
Maybe she's locked up.

67
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.890
All the windows are closed.

68
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.190
Which means that

69
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.690
either she closed them right after she dropped the ring

70
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.990
because she sensed danger,

71
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.090
or the one confining her closed them, right?

72
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.290
We'll have to find that room in a hurry

73
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.690
because she may be in danger.

74
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.590
All right. The Youth Detective Squad to the scene on the double.

75
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.190
Let's go!

76
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.990
Hey.

77
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.290
Don't tell me you seriously think it's a kidnap case?

78
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.490
I wonder,

79
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.490
but it's a good way to pass the time, isn't it?

80
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.590
What's the matter?

81
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.890
The door is an auto lock door and it won't open.

82
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.490
Behind you.

83
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.690
Have a nice day.

84
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.190
So, we got in, but what now?

85
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.090
Let's check the initials of the couples

86
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.690
who live in the rooms facing the little window

87
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.990
that we just saw,

88
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.890
and the room numbers from the 1st to 9th floors.

89
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.990
But, how?

90
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.490
There doesn't seem to be a manager's room here either.

91
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.290
The road we came from is exactly west of this condo.

92
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.490
All we have to do is find a room in this condo

93
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.490
that faces exactly west.

94
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.890
This way.

95
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.490
He's pretty good, isn't he?

96
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.790
That's nothing to be amazed of.

97
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.990
The initial of his first name is 'T' for Tsutomu.

98
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.890
It's not this room.

99
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.290
All the rooms above this one should have a number 5 on them.

100
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.490
Let's split up and check the name plates.

101
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.590
Haibara and Ayumi, go check the odd number floors.

102
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.290
We'll go check the even number floors.

103
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.790
You can count on us.

104
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.390
Goju Kaze?

105
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.490
Unusual name.

106
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.490
It's not read like that. It read Igarashi.

107
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.690
Oh?

108
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.490
Shima.

109
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.090
We have no way of knowing with just the last name.

110
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.090
The initial of his first name is 'S'.

111
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.490
It's not this room.

112
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.590
No.

113
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.790
We did it. The names of the entire family are written.

114
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.690
Too bad, no good again.

115
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.690
Their initials are 'K' for Kosaku and 'N' for Natsue.

116
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.690
And all their initials were displayed.

117
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.990
'A' and 'M'.

118
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.690
We did it. Isn't this it?

119
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.490
Genta, we're looking for a husband with the initial 'M'

120
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.990
and a wife with the initial 'A'.

121
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.990
-This is the opposite. -I see.

122
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.090
Look, look.

123
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.090
The initial of the first name is 'M'.

124
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.890
We can't tell what the name of his wife is.

125
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.090
He may be living alone.

126
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.690
I suppose.

127
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.490
Five rooms may be a possibility.

128
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.390
Out of the five, four only had their last names listed outside.

129
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.990
Maybe their names may be written on the post box outside.

130
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.390
Oh, that's right.

131
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.990
Let's go check.

132
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.290
Good thinking, Ayumi.

133
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.190
Wait. Please stay here, Genta.

134
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.290
If we all go out, we won't be able to get back in.

135
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.990
Shucks, no fun.

136
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.390
Rooms 205 and 305

137
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.790
have only the last name listed, after all.

138
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.990
But, look. 805 and 905.

139
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.390
'Y' and 'E' so they aren't the ones.

140
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.590
So, we've only got three more to go.

141
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.590
Room 205 and 305.

142
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.990
I wonder if there's any way we can check the names?

143
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.290
There is a way.

144
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.090
Where are you going?

145
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.690
Hey, just where are you guys going?

146
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.590
Hey, don't leave me here alone!

147
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.590
Here it is. 4-11-10 Beika-cho.

148
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.190
It's the address of this condo.

149
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.490
The name is...

150
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.790
The initial's 'T', so he isn't the one.

151
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.690
Here it is.

152
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.490
The initial of his first name is 'M'.

153
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.790
All right.

154
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.490
So, the possibilities now

155
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.590
are Mr. Masakazu Shima of room 305

156
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.390
and Mr. Michihiro Ishida of room 705.

157
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.690
But, this is as far as we can check.

158
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.590
How about if we check the bicycles?

159
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.690
Oh, that's a good idea, Mitsuhiko.

160
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.490
Oh, shoots. What're they doing?

161
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.990
Hey.

162
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.090
Oh no, don't close.

163
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.890
What's up?

164
00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.690
It seems that you've gotten interested.

165
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.390
They're so serious about it, so...

166
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.090
I found it!

167
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.590
Mr. Shima's bicycle.

168
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.790
See.

169
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.190
Asuka?

170
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.390
Initial is 'A'.

171
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.990
Then, the husband's initial is 'M'

172
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.990
and the wife's initial is 'A'?

173
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.990
Bingo. We've finally found them.

174
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.590
But, there's still Mr. Michihiro Ishida left.

175
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.690
If it's just one family, I guess we could ask the neighbors.

176
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.890
"Ishida"

177
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.690
I guess nobody's home.

178
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.590
If the neighbor's not in, let's go right down below.

179
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.690
All right.

180
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.490
This is the room where the initials 'A' and 'M'

181
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.490
belonged to the wrong person.

182
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.490
I made a mistake.

183
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.690
Hello.

184
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.490
What is it?

185
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.490
We're doing research on the

186
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.790
life of the Japanese people for our class.

187
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.290
What? I can't hear you very well!

188
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.190
And, we're checking on Japanese names in particular.

189
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.690
Do you happen to know the name of Mr. Ishida's wife,

190
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.690
who lives above you?

191
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.690
How would I know the name of the person who lives above me?

192
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.590
What a lady.

193
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.790
If right below is no good then...

194
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.890
Let's go right above, right?

195
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.190
Mr. Ishida's wife's name?

196
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.990
I'm sure it was Fumiko.

197
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.090
F-U-M-I-K-O.

198
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.490
Once before a postal delivery for her

199
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.590
was mistakenly delivered here.

200
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.190
Fumiko, which means...

201
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.090
The initial of her name is 'F'.

202
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.790
Her child is called Yuta and he's a smart kid.

203
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.290
He got locked up in the closet once before

204
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.190
and couldn't come out.

205
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.490
Huh? A closet, you mean the room to the extreme west?

206
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.790
Right.

207
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.490
What do you think he did back then?

208
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.790
He dropped and hung toilet paper out of the window of the restroom,

209
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.490
and let the people who were walking below know.

210
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.090
Miss.

211
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.290
Do all the people who live in this condo know that story?

212
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.690
Yes, I'm sure they do.

213
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.190
It's a well known story within this condo so...

214
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.490
Oh my God. It's been done before.

215
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.490
Conan.

216
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.490
What on earth is the matter?

217
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.190
We're going to the 3rd floor.

218
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.090
Because the only ones with the initials 'M' and 'A'

219
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.590
are Masakazu Shima and his wife Asuka of room 305.

220
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.490
What's going on? You're suddenly so interested.

221
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.690
He starting to think that there something going on

222
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.090
after talking to the lady.

223
00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:37.079
What?

224
00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:38.379
Hide.

225
00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:53.279
They're thieves.

226
00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.979
They're wearing gloves.

227
00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:56.979
Sunglasses too.

228
00:13:56.979 --> 00:13:59.379
You don't even finish the job right.

229
00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.379
Why'd you kill for?

230
00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:02.779
Shut up.

231
00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:04.379
Kill?

232
00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:06.079
Darn, we're too late.

233
00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.379
What shall we do, Conan?

234
00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:10.179
Let's call the police.

235
00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:12.679
Hurry!

236
00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:15.779
We've got to get outside before they get on the elevator!

237
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.279
That was a close one.

238
00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:36.979
Police officers.

239
00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:39.379
Let's tell them!

240
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:43.179
Big trouble! It's armed robbery and murder!

241
00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:44.979
In that condo over there!

242
00:14:44.979 --> 00:14:47.779
You'd better hurry or the criminals'll get away!

243
00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:49.879
Please hurry!

244
00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:57.479
Hold it! You're not getting away!

245
00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:59.579
What is it?

246
00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:02.479
It's them.

247
00:15:02.479 --> 00:15:04.979
They killed a woman.

248
00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:07.079
They may be armed with a gun.

249
00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.179
What?

250
00:15:08.179 --> 00:15:09.679
What's with you guys?

251
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.379
What on earth is this about?

252
00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:13.679
Freeze.

253
00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.779
You kids go outside.

254
00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:19.079
Please check inside room 305.

255
00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:21.579
The dead body of Asuka Shima should be there.

256
00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:22.879
Dead body?

257
00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:26.379
What are you talking about? There's no such dead body!

258
00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:27.579
Don't lie.

259
00:15:27.579 --> 00:15:31.379
Then why did you say, "Why did you kill?" Just a while ago?

260
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:33.379
We all heard you, right?

261
00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:34.579
Yep.

262
00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:36.579
Come on.

263
00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:38.779
That's about an insect.

264
00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:40.079
An insect?

265
00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:43.479
I was angry because he carelessly killed my insect.

266
00:15:43.479 --> 00:15:46.779
And, besides, I'm Asuka Shima.

267
00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:52.279
See, my driver's license.

268
00:15:57.779 --> 00:15:59.679
Ghads, talk about being a nuisance.

269
00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:02.479
There was no dead body anywhere.

270
00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:05.279
Besides, we checked with the neighbors

271
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:08.179
and they verified that those two were Mr. and Mrs. Shima too.

272
00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:10.779
All of you, apologize to them.

273
00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:12.179
Yes, sir.

274
00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:16.179
We're really very sorry.

275
00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:17.379
No problem.

276
00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:21.179
We confused you with the subject we were talking about too.

277
00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:25.579
But, officer, it's true that someone is being locked up.

278
00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:27.479
No, that's enough.

279
00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:29.879
Don't you ever do something like this again.

280
00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.479
Yes, sir.

281
00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:40.379
They were married.

282
00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:44.079
We completely mistook them to be armed robbers and murderers.

283
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:45.779
There is no other room

284
00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:48.179
where the occupants initials are 'M' or 'A', is there...

285
00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:51.979
Maybe these aren't initials.

286
00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:54.579
Something bothers me.

287
00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:55.979
I wonder what it is.

288
00:16:56.479 --> 00:17:00.279
Maybe the person's name in room 705 is read Ayako

289
00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:02.979
and not Fumiko?

290
00:17:02.979 --> 00:17:06.179
Right. If it's read 'Ayako', the initial would be 'A'.

291
00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:14.879
We're lucky to buy the meat so cheap,

292
00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:16.479
weren't we, Fumiko?

293
00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:18.879
We sure were, mother.

294
00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:21.279
So, it's read Fumiko, after all.

295
00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:23.179
So, they're safe.

296
00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:26.279
Hurry up, Yuta.

297
00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:32.479
He's the Toilet Paper boy, isn't he?

298
00:17:41.979 --> 00:17:44.579
Hurry up, Yuta.

299
00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:48.079
What a skinny mother.

300
00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.279
My mom is so over-weight

301
00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:53.079
that she's wearing dad's tee-shirts.

302
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:55.079
Over-weight?

303
00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:57.379
Ayumi, let me see the ring.

304
00:17:58.179 --> 00:17:59.479
Here you go.

305
00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:00.979
Conan?

306
00:18:02.179 --> 00:18:04.579
What's with him?

307
00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:09.879
Hey, Conan? What's up?

308
00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:13.679
Open up! What're you saying, Conan?

309
00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:19.179
He's gone.

310
00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:28.179
"Akihiko Uehara, Misato Uehara"

311
00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:32.079
You again? What now?

312
00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:36.179
Hey. What's with you, anyway?

313
00:18:36.579 --> 00:18:40.679
This is what was bothering me after all.

314
00:18:41.479 --> 00:18:44.379
Hey, get out of here, will you?

315
00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:47.779
Are you Mr. Akihiko Uehara's wife?

316
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:50.379
Is your name Misato?

317
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.679
Huh? Yes.

318
00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:54.879
This is yours then, isn't it?

319
00:18:54.879 --> 00:18:57.379
I picked it up in front of the door a while ago.

320
00:18:57.379 --> 00:19:00.579
The initials 'A' for Akihiko and 'M',

321
00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:02.879
for the initial of your fist name is carved on it.

322
00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:04.179
Try it on.

323
00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:16.479
Take a good look at the ring, lady.

324
00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:19.779
The initials 'M' to 'A' are carved on it.

325
00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:25.479
From 'M' to 'A'. From Misato to Akihiko.

326
00:19:25.479 --> 00:19:30.079
Yeah, that's actually Akihiko's ring.

327
00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:32.579
But, Misato was wearing it.

328
00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:35.279
That's why it was hard to tell.

329
00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.079
According to the neighbors they say that

330
00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:40.679
Misato has recently gained weight.

331
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:43.279
Not being able to wear her own ring,

332
00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:46.179
she probably wore Akihiko's ring instead.

333
00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:48.479
Because many Japanese men don't wear rings

334
00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.479
even after getting married.

335
00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:52.079
And besides, I think that Akihiko

336
00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:55.379
has slender fingers for a man.

337
00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:00.479
What are you getting at?

338
00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:05.479
Aren't those shoes a little too small for you to wear?

339
00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:09.579
Is that all you wanted to say?

340
00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:13.679
What I want to say is that

341
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.579
you're not Misato, an impostor.

342
00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:18.479
Huh?

343
00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:20.479
So...

344
00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:22.479
What if I am?

345
00:20:35.179 --> 00:20:37.079
That was real close.

346
00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:53.179
Mrs. Misato Uehara?

347
00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:55.079
Yes, who are you, sonny?

348
00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:58.779
Me? I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

349
00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:30.279
The criminal Ikuyo Hasegawa

350
00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:34.479
used to be Misato Uehara's husband's ex-colleague

351
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.079
and, since Akihiko had found that

352
00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:37.779
she had embezzled money from the company,

353
00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:38.879
she was fired from the company.

354
00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:41.079
She had committed the crime out of hatred for him.

355
00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:45.579
Ikuyo had visited the condo in order to kill Akihiko.

356
00:22:45.579 --> 00:22:48.279
When Misato answers the door, Ikuyo put her to sleep using a drug,

357
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:52.079
and locked her up in the closet.

358
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:55.079
Misato, who came to a while later

359
00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:57.579
connects the ring to the 'S' hook

360
00:22:57.579 --> 00:23:00.179
and throws it out of the window in hopes of getting help.

361
00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:02.779
But, right after that,

362
00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:06.979
Ikuyo who comes to check on her closes the window,

363
00:23:06.979 --> 00:23:09.579
and was put to sleep again with the drug.

364
00:23:10.379 --> 00:23:12.979
Wow, you really did a good job, sonny.

365
00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:15.179
Take care on your way home.

366
00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:16.379
Yes, sir.

367
00:23:19.479 --> 00:23:21.179
No fair, Conan.

368
00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:23.979
Really, taking all the good part for yourself.

369
00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:26.079
Yeah, you get me so mad.

370
00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:29.079
You hold all this as punishment.

371
00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:34.779
What? Am I supposed to hold all this?

372
00:23:34.779 --> 00:23:36.079
Of course.

373
00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:38.279
Hey, wait.

374
00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:42.279
Thanks for holding mine too.

375
00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:46.479
Hey, hey, not you too.

376
00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:56.679
It's my turn to send out an SOS signal.

377
00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:01.779
I wonder what chlorine is?

378
00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:05.179
Chlorine is deadly toxic.

379
00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:09.079
Hey, these are the gloves for 120 yen!

380
00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:13.379
We can make mole balls with it.

381
00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:14.779
Youth Detective Squad.

382
00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:16.579
I've found the bicycle we're searching for.

383
00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:19.079
Come to the scene on the double.

384
00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:22.379
Who does that guy intend to feed it to?

385
00:24:23.179 --> 00:24:24.479
Next Conan,

386
00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:28.300
"Dangerous Recipe"

387
00:24:28.897 --> 00:24:31.097
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:31.097 --> 00:24:33.397
"A dust pan"

389
00:24:33.397 --> 00:24:34.897
The Youth Detective Squad does a good job in the next episode too.

390
00:24:34.897 --> 00:24:36.997
We'll take on any case.

391
00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:38.397
Why am I always left out?
