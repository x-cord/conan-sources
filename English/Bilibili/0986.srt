1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,240
Muto Masako-san came to the
agency to hire the old man

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:04,690
Muto Masako (36)
Housewife

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,450
to find her missing husband Muto Issei,
the president of a trading company.

to find her missing husband Muto Issei,
the president of a trading company.

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,200
Muto Issei (45)
Self-employed

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,160
After accepting the job,

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,750
the old man and I followed the
trail of clues and found Muto.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,300
Muto was actually the president of a
second-hand shop and not a trading company.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,400
And?

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,540
What are you going to do now?

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,640
Muto-san.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,920
What should I do?

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,150
I don't know what to do, so I
haven't been able to do anything.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,540
If you think it's not too late,
then shouldn't you go back to her?

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,740
What?

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,040
You don't seem like a bad person.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,100
Can't you and your wife get
along even after all this happened?

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,870
Besides, I believe that's what she wants.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,010
We do have quite a few problems,

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,120
but we've decided to start over together.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,940
I see. That's good.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,030
I really have no idea how to thank you.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,850
Yes, thank you.

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,790
Goodbye.

26
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,860
Find the question that solves the mystery!

27
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,880
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,910
What happened to the happy couple?

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,340
What is the face hidden behind the mask?

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,950
Always determining the one truth

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,690
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

32
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,160
his name is Detective Conan!

What? What did you say?
Mori Detective Agency

38
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:15,558
Muto-san is dead?!

39
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,428
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

40
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:25,738
Hey, Mister.

41
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,208
What do you think happened?

42
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,538
Didn't they make up?

43
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,278
Yeah.

44
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,038
Then why?

45
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:35,688
How should I know?

46
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,288
All we can do is head to the crime scene.

47
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:53,948
Inspector Megure!

48
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:57,748
The victim is Muto Issei-san.

49
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:00,188
He was the president of
this second-hand shop.

50
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:05,188
The estimated time of death is
between 2 AM and 6 AM this morning.

51
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:08,998
We won't know the cause of
death until after the autopsy,

52
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:12,208
but the body was burnt to a crisp.

53
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:16,628
Furthermore, all the teeth were removed,

54
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:19,208
perhaps to delay the body's identification.

55
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:23,818
We didn't find any fingerprints
on the stun gun

56
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:25,958
or gas container left at the crime scene.

57
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:28,778
Inspector!

58
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:30,838
Mori-kun.

59
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:33,498
What are you doing here?

60
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,098
I was actually hired by Muto-san's wife.

61
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,838
Hired?

62
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:43,358
My husband went missing for a few days.

63
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:49,148
But Mori-san found him last night,
and he returned home safely.

64
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:54,618
But he ended up like that this morning.

65
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,408
Masako-san, does this mean
your husband left the house

66
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:02,768
and came here after talking to you?

67
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:03,668
Yes.

68
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:08,378
He said he needed to do something
for work and left around 1 AM.

69
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:12,978
We're checking the security
camera footage right now.

70
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,278
Hey.

71
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:18,598
How did you know the victim was your husband?

72
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:22,248
He looked the same from behind.

73
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,478
More than anything, those were his clothes.

74
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:29,738
But the culprit tried to
conceal his identity, right?

75
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,608
I see.

76
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:35,488
When you think of it that way, it is odd
that they didn't change his clothes.

77
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:39,528
I can tell. That's my husband.

78
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:40,918
I'm sure of it.

79
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,498
If his wife says so, then it must be true.

80
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:49,038
Mori-san, thank for everything
you've done so far.

81
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:55,318
Now that things have ended up like
this, I don't know what to say.

82
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:58,248
You have my sympathies, ma'am.

83
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:01,968
I'll deposit your pay in your bank account.

84
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:03,568
Goodbye.

85
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:15,198
Hey, Mister. Was it really
her husband that died?

86
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:16,098
Huh?

87
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:22,078
If she made a mistake, wouldn't
she be really happy to hear that?

88
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:24,398
You're right!

89
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:26,908
Thank you, Mori-san.

90
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:29,508
I'll never forget what you did for me.

91
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,748
Call me Kogoro, ma'am.

92
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,468
Maybe that could happen.

93
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:41,468
Let's start by questioning
the shop employees.

94
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:44,728
What?

95
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:47,398
Someone who's been missing
since this morning?

96
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:49,728
Yes. Is there anyone like that?

97
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:52,618
Well, there is one.

98
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,778
Who is it?

99
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:57,658
The president.

100
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,208
Why did he have to die?

101
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,078
What's going to happen to this company?

102
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,888
That's not what I meant...

103
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,568
Anyway, I wonder where he went.

104
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,338
Yeah.

105
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:16,008
He's not the type of guy to take
the day off without notice.

106
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:17,088
Hey, wait.

107
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,098
What's his name and address?

108
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:27,308
Excuse me. Nonaka-san.

109
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,158
Are you home?

110
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,358
It's not locked.

111
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,488
Nonaka-san.

112
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,028
Nonaka Sadahiko-san.

113
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:39,518
The employee who's been
missing since this morning.

114
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:44,788
The place is a mess, but it doesn't
look like there was a scuffle.

115
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,208
Did he go out without his wallet?

116
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:50,868
Nonaka Sadahiko
(38) Employee

117
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,338
Hey, mister.
Nonaka Sadahiko
(38) Employee

118
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:52,708
Nonaka Sadahiko
(38) Employee

119
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:54,998
What is it?

120
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:56,468
This is weird.

121
00:08:56,968 --> 00:09:00,678
There's a cup and toothpaste,
but I don't see a toothbrush.

122
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:02,388
I bet I know why.

123
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:05,668
He probably left the house
while brushing his teeth.

124
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:07,888
Seriously?

125
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,288
It has nothing to do with the case.

126
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,808
Let's go to the next place.

127
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:14,148
Wait, Mister.

128
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,398
President's Office

129
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:19,778
Hello.

130
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,208
Well, Inspector?

131
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,958
Judging by the room's state, it looks
like he was in a hurry to go somewhere.

132
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:29,628
I see.

133
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:32,208
It certainly does look
like he was in a hurry.

134
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,958
Inspector Megure, what's this?

135
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:42,548
Inside this garbage can.

136
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:46,818
Looks like something was burned.

137
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,028
Documents...

138
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:51,308
No, it looks like an insurance
certificate or something.

139
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,318
Inspector Megure.

140
00:09:55,858 --> 00:10:01,428
There's no security camera
footage of the last three days.

141
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,668
It seems to have been deliberately erased.

142
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:09,448
We also got the DNA results.

143
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,328
And?

144
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:15,158
The DNA on the provided toothbrush
and body were a match.

145
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,088
Then...

146
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,838
The victim really was Muto-san.

147
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:28,608
Masako-san's testimony...

148
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:32,348
The DNA and circumstantial evidence...

149
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,158
They all point to Muto
Issei-san being the victim.

150
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:40,268
However, not only were there
signs that the culprit

151
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,358
tried to conceal the victim's identity and
the security camera footage was erased,

152
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:46,618
the employee Nonaka-san is also missing.

153
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:53,208
If that burnt body isn't Muto Issei-san's,

154
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,328
then where is he now?

155
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,628
And what about Nonaka-san?

156
00:10:59,178 --> 00:10:59,888
Huh?

157
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,058
Three utility poles...

158
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:21,308
Two utility poles...

159
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,478
This is the odd feeling I
got when we first came here.

160
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:35,138
When standing inside the fence, only
two of the three poles are visible.

161
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,848
In other words...

162
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,088
It must be here.

163
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,038
There's a space behind the fence here.

164
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,228
A secret door, huh?

165
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,908
I see.

166
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:15,758
Muto-san may have had a kind face,

167
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:18,648
but he was an incredible liar.

168
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,058
But now everything's
finally coming into focus.

169
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,235
Everything was normal until yesterday.

170
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:37,045
I see. Excuse me.

171
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,695
Hello?

172
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:42,695
Ah, Mori-san. What is it?

173
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,695
I'd like to confirm a few things with you.

174
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:54,455
First, are you aware of the missing
employee Nonaka Sadahiko-san?

175
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:55,785
Yes.

176
00:12:55,785 --> 00:13:00,355
We actually believe he might
be involved in Muto's murder.

177
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:01,515
I see.

178
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:08,115
Then was Masako-san asked to
provide a DNA sample of Muto-san?

179
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:08,985
Yes.

180
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:12,225
She gave us the toothbrush he normally used.

181
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,005
I see.

182
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:16,865
Did you figure something out?

183
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:20,105
Takagi, I'd like you to
help me with something.

184
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,725
Yes, got it.

185
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,235
I'll make the arrangements. Bye.

186
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,935
Jeez.

187
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,745
Where did that brat go?

188
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:33,765
Huh?

189
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:41,295
Excuse me.

190
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,895
Are you all leaving now?

191
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:45,655
Yes.

192
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:48,405
We've finished examining
the area for the most part.

193
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,385
We've already finished
investigating your home,

194
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:56,015
so you're free to return.

195
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,605
Do you think you'll find the culprit?

196
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,535
I promise we'll do everything we can.

197
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:04,655
Thank you.

198
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:09,325
We may contact you again for questioning.

199
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,655
We appreciate your cooperation.

200
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:15,365
All right. Anytime is fine.

201
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:16,695
Goodbye.

202
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,875
We've been waiting for you, Muto Masako-san.

203
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,765
What's the meaning of this?

204
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:23,685
Mori-kun.

205
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:25,135
Yes?

206
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:29,855
You gave us instructions because you
knew Muto's wife would come here.

207
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,815
What? I did?

208
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,455
But I didn't do—

209
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,925
Muto Masako-san, allow me to be direct.

210
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:47,995
Where is your husband Muto Issei?

211
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:51,255
You know where he is.

212
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,505
I don't know what you're talking about.

213
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:58,755
Muto's body has been sent for autopsy.

214
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,655
No, Inspector.

215
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,515
That isn't Muto's body.

216
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,245
It's not?!

217
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:09,545
But the body and Muto's DNA were a match.

218
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:13,195
Who provided that DNA sample?

219
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:17,875
His wife provided the
toothbrush he normally used.

220
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,525
You're aware an employee
here, Nonaka Sadahiko-san,

221
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,635
has been missing since this morning, correct?

222
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,535
Yeah.

223
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:29,925
Nonaka-san's toothbrush was
missing from his apartment.

224
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:30,915
Hold on.

225
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:34,955
You're saying the body is Nonaka's?

226
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,005
Yes.

227
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:42,805
And he was most likely killed by
Masako-san's husband Muto Issei.

228
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,215
What?!

229
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:50,795
He was probably a thief who repeatedly
used this second-hand shop as a cover.

230
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:55,485
All the items here are stolen goods.

231
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,445
Stolen goods?

232
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:03,435
Mori-san is correct.

233
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,825
My husband is a thief.

234
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,925
After he and I reconciled,

235
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:11,995
he said he'd take me with him and run.

236
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:19,705
Because I hired Mori-san, I believe
he feared his crimes would be exposed.

237
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:24,165
I gathered everything valuable
in our home and came here.

238
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:27,515
While I helped him pack,

239
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:32,045
he said we'd flee overseas and
wait for things to cool down.

240
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:39,445
But that's not all! He—

241
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:43,075
He summoned Nonaka-san here and
knocked him out with a stun gun.

242
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,575
He disabled Nonaka-san,

243
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,415
dressed him in his own clothes,

244
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:58,775
and used gasoline to murder him.

245
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:18,355
You describe it as if you watched it happen.

246
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:23,665
It's just my deduction based on
the evidence and circumstances.

247
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:27,525
Furthermore, when you tried to stop him,

248
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:30,865
you got that scrape under your sunglasses.

249
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:40,125
Nothing gets past you.

250
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:50,815
He wasn't a loyal husband or a simple thief.

251
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:54,895
He was a cold-blooded murderer.

252
00:18:55,605 --> 00:19:02,395
So I have to settle this myself.

253
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,485
You're correct.

254
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:24,425
The toothbrush I provided was brought here by
Nonaka-san when Muto summoned him here.

255
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:28,305
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

256
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:34,085
Probably because if Muto
was thought to be dead,

257
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,805
then nobody would go looking for him.

258
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:42,085
She could decide what to do about
him without any interference.

259
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,265
Where is Muto-san now?

260
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,325
Is he alive?

261
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,325
Who knows?

262
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:56,075
Will you tell us where he is?

263
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:59,625
He deserves to be punished.

264
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,095
Punished?

265
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:03,865
For murdering someone?

266
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,635
Or for betraying you?

267
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:12,515
Muto was trying to kill me.

268
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:13,765
What?!

269
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,335
I saw it while I was helping
him organize documents.

270
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,275
He took out a life insurance policy
on me for an exorbitant amount.

271
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:26,665
So the burnt documents were
an insurance certificate.

272
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:27,655
Masako-san!

273
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:31,695
If he's still alive, please tell
us where he is immediately!

274
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:35,705
A man like him doesn't deserve to live.

275
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,505
Is he around there?

276
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:38,955
Masako-san.

277
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:42,115
I'll ask one more time.

278
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,205
Where is Muto now?

279
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:53,305
Detective Takagi, he's in
the trunk of the silver car!

280
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:54,455
Yes, sir!

281
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:01,355
He's here!

282
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:05,485
He's still breathing!

283
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:17,495
Masako-san, I promise that
man will pay for what he did.

284
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:21,725
Was this really for the best?

285
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:26,085
He betrayed me. He ruined my life.

286
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,905
He even tried to kill me.

287
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:34,005
Still, we must stand strong.

288
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:37,515
You made the right choice.

289
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:11,585
I'm not looking for missing
persons for a while.

290
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:16,905
Seems like even you're
over couples' quarrels.

291
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:18,405
Excuse me.

292
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:21,615
This is the Mori Detective Agency, right?

293
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,655
Yes.

294
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:27,035
Great. I'd like you to find my wife.

295
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,875
Whoa! She's beautiful!

296
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,655
You can count on me.

297
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:40,025
I promise that I, the great Mori Kogoro,
will find this beauty—I mean, your wife.

298
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:42,605
I thought you weren't taking
on any missing persons cases.

299
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:44,635
We're looking for his wife!

300
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:47,975
I'm sure it'll be fine this time!

301
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,185
Ma'am, I'm on my way!

302
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:53,075
Seriously?
Ma'am, I'm on my way!
