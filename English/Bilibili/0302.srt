1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.240
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.940
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.640
We'll get to the truth of the bomb threat case.

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.640
The love story of an officer at police headquarters.

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:45.228
When we went to see the victory parade of the Tokyo Spirits,

9
00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:47.328
we, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

10
00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:50.828
ran into Officer Sato and the others of the police department in disguise.

11
00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:52.028
Since a fax warning of

12
00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.528
something bad will happen at the parade

13
00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:57.028
was sent to police headquarters

14
00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:59.928
so the officers were out investigating and checking the site.

15
00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:02.328
Just then Officer Takagi's car...

16
00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:06.928
What is this?

17
00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:10.528
What happened?

18
00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:16.228
Inspector Shiratori!

19
00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:18.428
Where's Officer Takagi?

20
00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:21.728
If he got caught in the explosion,

21
00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:24.228
I doubt that he would make it.

22
00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:26.028
Then, you mean that Officer Takagi...

23
00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:27.528
Oh, no.

24
00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:28.928
That's only if the worst happens.

25
00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:32.328
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:35.928
I made it to safety by a hair's breadth,

27
00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:38.628
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

28
00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:40.828
When we were checking to see

29
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:44.128
if Mitsuhiko who was taking video near the scene

30
00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:45.528
had taken any pictures of the bomber...

31
00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:46.528
What?

32
00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:48.528
Another bomb went off?

33
00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:49.628
Yes.

34
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:53.228
This time it was at the phone booth in front of Haido Park.

35
00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:54.728
From the type of bomb that was used,

36
00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:56.628
it's most likely the same bomber.

37
00:02:56.628 --> 00:03:00.928
Which means that the bomber is not after us, the police

38
00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:02.428
but carried out an extremely heinous prank

39
00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:05.528
against the Tokyo Spirits.

40
00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:07.728
I wonder if it's really only a prank

41
00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:09.528
of bad taste towards the Spirits.

42
00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:15.128
And, besides, this tape that Mitsuhiko took.

43
00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:19.428
Is something that will point out the bomber

44
00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:20.928
really filmed on it?

45
00:03:22.228 --> 00:03:24.028
If so,

46
00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:26.428
what was filmed?

47
00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:34.128
"Parade of Malice and Saints (Part 2)"

48
00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:40.228
Look! Look at this...

49
00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:42.528
Don't you think this lady is suspicious?

50
00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:45.328
She's been glaring towards the camera right through!

51
00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:48.628
That's right! She looks kind of bothered.

52
00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.828
She just doesn't like the idea that Mitsuhiko

53
00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:53.628
is filming her mini-skirt from a low angle!

54
00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:55.128
But, no...

55
00:03:55.128 --> 00:03:56.828
I didn't mean to do anything like that.

56
00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.328
Then, what about this man with the beard?

57
00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:03.028
He seems to be looking around the ground, doesn't he?

58
00:04:03.028 --> 00:04:05.128
Look carefully at his hand!

59
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:08.228
He's holding a child's shoe, right?

60
00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:10.328
So, he probably came to the parade

61
00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:12.028
with his wife who was carrying their child

62
00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:15.628
and both shoes just happened to come off.

63
00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:18.228
So I'm pretty sure he's looking for them.

64
00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:21.028
I see.

65
00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:22.928
Hey! Officer Takagi!

66
00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.328
You have to tell us some things that you've noticed too.

67
00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:30.828
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

68
00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:32.728
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

69
00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:34.228
Yes?

70
00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:36.028
Are you really watching it carefully?

71
00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.528
I watched it three times already.

72
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.228
But, no matter how many times I look at it, it's the same thing.

73
00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:43.528
If you think that the crowd is suspicious,

74
00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:45.628
everybody in the crowd looks suspicious

75
00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:47.128
and if you think nothing is suspicious,

76
00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:49.728
nothing looks suspicious.

77
00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:53.928
It's virtually impossible to pick the bomber out of this crowd.

78
00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:56.228
That's true.

79
00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:59.428
Which means that the bomber would've thought the same thing.

80
00:04:59.428 --> 00:05:01.328
But, the bomber stole the video camera

81
00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:04.328
and attempted to remove the tape that was inside.

82
00:05:04.328 --> 00:05:06.628
What did he did that for?

83
00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:11.328
Maybe the culprit thought he was being filmed

84
00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:13.028
although nothing was filmed?

85
00:05:13.028 --> 00:05:14.428
Nothing was filmed?

86
00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:16.828
Wait a second.

87
00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:18.828
Nothing was filmed means...

88
00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:21.628
Don't tell me that...

89
00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:26.828
I see.

90
00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.628
Conan.

91
00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:33.328
Was something filmed?

92
00:05:33.328 --> 00:05:34.828
No, nothing really.

93
00:05:34.828 --> 00:05:36.928
Then, it's no good?

94
00:05:36.928 --> 00:05:39.128
No, not really.

95
00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:40.628
The bomber probably

96
00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:43.228
want the tape not because something was filmed on it,

97
00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:44.928
but rather because that person

98
00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.228
was trying to hide evidence that nothing was filmed!

99
00:05:47.228 --> 00:05:50.028
-What? -What?

100
00:05:50.028 --> 00:05:52.028
Just what do you mean?

101
00:05:52.028 --> 00:05:56.328
There's something I got to confirm first, though.

102
00:05:57.428 --> 00:06:00.128
Hey, Conan. What is going on?

103
00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:02.428
What do you mean hide evidence that nothing was filmed?

104
00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:05.728
Since nothing was filmed on the tape I took,

105
00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:09.728
the bomber didn't have to steal it, right?

106
00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:12.228
Conan, wait!

107
00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:14.328
Hey, Conan!

108
00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:17.828
Just as I thought.

109
00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:19.428
It's just as I thought!

110
00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:24.428
What's with the mailbox?

111
00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:28.828
You know what time Mitsuhiko climbed on top of the mailbox, don't you?

112
00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:31.928
I don't remember details like that!

113
00:06:31.928 --> 00:06:34.828
We can figure that out by watching the video tape

114
00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.828
because the time is also filmed.

115
00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:39.028
That's right!

116
00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:45.528
It was the time I was filming

117
00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:49.428
something far away by zooming so...

118
00:06:49.428 --> 00:06:53.328
Here it is! It was 2:23 in the afternoon!

119
00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:57.328
After that, we ran into Officer Sato

120
00:06:57.328 --> 00:07:01.328
and until 14:38 when Mitsuhiko quit taking video,

121
00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:04.128
we were by this mailbox, right?

122
00:07:04.128 --> 00:07:07.228
So what?

123
00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:09.628
Then, take a look at this!

124
00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:13.028
Look at the time the mail is supposed to be picked up!

125
00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:15.828
On holidays it says about 14:30.

126
00:07:15.828 --> 00:07:18.328
That means they should be here

127
00:07:18.328 --> 00:07:19.628
about 2:30 in the afternoon, right?

128
00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:21.328
Yeah.

129
00:07:21.328 --> 00:07:22.528
Which means,

130
00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:27.728
we didn't see what we were supposed to see, didn't we?

131
00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:28.728
Right!

132
00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:30.628
The mailman's car!

133
00:07:30.628 --> 00:07:33.928
They never came to pick the mails.

134
00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:38.528
But the road was blocked by the parade

135
00:07:38.528 --> 00:07:40.028
so maybe it couldn't come through?

136
00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:41.228
No.

137
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:44.228
They usually choose a parade course

138
00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:47.028
that does not interfere with duties of that sort.

139
00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:50.728
Besides, only one lane is being used for the parade

140
00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:53.228
that there is no way that the mail truck cannot make its way here.

141
00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:55.928
But, if the roads are crowded,

142
00:07:55.928 --> 00:07:58.828
it's easy to be late by about eight minutes.

143
00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:00.728
No way.

144
00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:04.328
It didn't look like there was a traffic jam,

145
00:08:04.328 --> 00:08:06.828
and the collection time indicated on the mailbox

146
00:08:06.828 --> 00:08:08.328
is in intervals of five minutes.

147
00:08:08.328 --> 00:08:11.428
If there is a discrepancy of five minutes earlier or later,

148
00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:14.528
the only thing I can think of is that something came up.

149
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:17.828
But the one who tried to steal Mitsuhiko's video camera

150
00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.328
is the bomber, right?

151
00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:21.028
Right.

152
00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:24.628
What does the mail truck have anything to do with this?

153
00:08:24.628 --> 00:08:27.028
And besides, would anyone want to steal

154
00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:29.328
the videotape in the first place?

155
00:08:29.328 --> 00:08:30.628
If it was left as is,

156
00:08:30.628 --> 00:08:32.928
nobody would've noticed anything,

157
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:35.028
but now, it's like telling everybody

158
00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:38.528
that something may be there!

159
00:08:38.528 --> 00:08:39.628
Yeah.

160
00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:42.828
I guess they didn't intend to steal it either.

161
00:08:42.828 --> 00:08:45.228
If we were just a bunch of ordinary kids

162
00:08:45.228 --> 00:08:47.428
who came to watch the parade.

163
00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:49.328
I get it!

164
00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:52.028
Yumi's mini-police car!

165
00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:54.928
Since you were witnessed talking intimately with Yumi

166
00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:56.928
in front of the mailbox,

167
00:08:56.928 --> 00:08:59.528
the culprit tried to get rid of the evidence!

168
00:08:59.528 --> 00:09:00.928
Yeah.

169
00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:03.828
If a bombing incident takes part nearby,

170
00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:05.628
it means that there is a possibility

171
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.928
the bomber would be filmed on the video,

172
00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:12.628
and the police would without doubt check the film out.

173
00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:15.528
Moreover, if we are acquainted with the police,

174
00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:17.428
the time it would take to check the tape out

175
00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:20.028
would be pretty speedy.

176
00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:23.028
That's what the bomber was afraid of!

177
00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:27.328
They probably noticed Mitsuhiko's video camera

178
00:09:27.328 --> 00:09:29.728
only after they set the bomb up under Officer Takagi's car

179
00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:33.228
that was parked right opposite the mailbox.

180
00:09:33.228 --> 00:09:36.728
They couldn't go retrieve the paper bag under the car.

181
00:09:36.728 --> 00:09:39.828
So they decided to get rid of the tape.

182
00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:41.928
I don't understand, though.

183
00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:44.728
The bomber faxed the police to let them know that

184
00:09:44.728 --> 00:09:47.028
something was going to happen, right?

185
00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:48.928
Yes.

186
00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:51.028
If they call all the police officers over

187
00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:53.328
and blow the car up,

188
00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:55.028
it's obvious that the police

189
00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:58.928
will come frantically after them.

190
00:09:58.928 --> 00:10:02.128
Maybe they want to distract the police?

191
00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:06.028
By pretending to be the same bomber three years ago?

192
00:10:06.028 --> 00:10:10.428
Although I have no idea what kind of a case it was.

193
00:10:10.428 --> 00:10:13.028
There's a high probability that

194
00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:15.028
the bomber is after the lives of the police force,

195
00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:19.128
just as was the case three years ago!

196
00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:21.128
You just kind of resembled him.

197
00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:23.728
The you just a while ago.

198
00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:28.228
It seems that the one Officer Sato was trying to rescue was...

199
00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:31.328
And I'd like to have a word with you later.

200
00:10:34.828 --> 00:10:37.728
The question is, what the bomber is after.

201
00:10:37.728 --> 00:10:38.828
Yeah.

202
00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:41.528
It's very likely that the bomber is not after the police

203
00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:44.728
nor playing pranks against the Spirits.

204
00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:47.328
If my deduction is correct,

205
00:10:47.328 --> 00:10:50.628
they are after...

206
00:10:50.628 --> 00:10:52.528
But, since I'm still not sure,

207
00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:54.028
I want you and Officer Takagi

208
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.928
to check something out for me.

209
00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:58.928
Aye! You can count on us!

210
00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:02.128
Officer Takagi, are you listening?

211
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.228
Yeah.

212
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:07.028
I'm listening...

213
00:11:07.028 --> 00:11:08.728
This is Ayumi!

214
00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:12.428
Conan, I've found the mailbox!

215
00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:14.228
Okay, what's the location of the mailbox

216
00:11:14.228 --> 00:11:15.728
and the collection time?

217
00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:19.028
The mailbox is under the pedestrian overpass, two traffic signals away

218
00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:20.728
from the first mailbox.

219
00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:23.028
The collection time is...

220
00:11:23.028 --> 00:11:25.928
About 14:35!

221
00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:27.128
Okay!

222
00:11:27.128 --> 00:11:29.428
Mitsuhiko here!

223
00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:32.328
I've found one in front of the convenience store on Nichome!

224
00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:35.928
The time is about 14:45!

225
00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:37.828
This Genta!

226
00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:41.128
I found one near the park on Sanchome.

227
00:11:41.128 --> 00:11:43.828
The time is 14:55.

228
00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.028
Hey, Genta.

229
00:11:45.028 --> 00:11:46.928
Why are you whispering?

230
00:11:46.928 --> 00:11:48.628
I can't help

231
00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:51.528
because I went through somebody's yard, which was a short-cut.

232
00:11:51.528 --> 00:11:53.928
I was mistaken for a thief after women's underwear,

233
00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:57.728
and I'm hiding from the lady who came after me.

234
00:11:57.728 --> 00:11:59.628
I see. Hang in there.

235
00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:01.728
Now all we have to do is wait for Ai.

236
00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:02.928
Yeah.

237
00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:06.328
Oh, it's her!

238
00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:08.528
This is the woman in black.

239
00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:09.728
Hey!

240
00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:12.828
The location of the mailbox is on the side of a bus stop

241
00:12:12.828 --> 00:12:16.428
that is about 150m west from the mailbox on Sanchome.

242
00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:19.328
The collection time is 16:25.

243
00:12:19.328 --> 00:12:21.728
I just saw all of you now.

244
00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:23.228
Can you see me?

245
00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:25.228
Yeah!

246
00:12:25.228 --> 00:12:30.128
Lastly, the pick up time for this mailbox is...

247
00:12:30.128 --> 00:12:32.228
16:30.

248
00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:39.328
So, if I match all the information with the map...

249
00:12:39.328 --> 00:12:43.128
The course of the mail truck is like this.

250
00:12:43.128 --> 00:12:46.128
Just like you said, Shinichi,

251
00:12:46.128 --> 00:12:47.528
it seems to be getting farther and farther

252
00:12:47.528 --> 00:12:49.928
from the course of the parade.

253
00:12:49.928 --> 00:12:54.028
In addition, today is the Sunday before payday.

254
00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:57.528
Now, all we have to do is wait for Officer Takagi to contact us.

255
00:12:57.528 --> 00:12:59.928
If there were no traffic accidents

256
00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:03.728
or road construction is this area today,

257
00:13:03.728 --> 00:13:05.828
the reason the mail truck didn't come

258
00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:08.428
to pick up the mail is...

259
00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:36.391
Excuse me.

260
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:40.391
What's the matter, Mr. Tsutsumi?

261
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:42.391
If you're dropping off the mail that you collected,

262
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:43.891
go around the back and...

263
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:45.491
Well...

264
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:50.091
A large amount of very odd mail is mixed in the bag.

265
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:52.991
I want everyone to look at it now,

266
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:55.891
but could you open the front entrance please?

267
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:58.391
Okay. I understand.

268
00:13:58.391 --> 00:14:00.091
I'll go open it right away.

269
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:19.491
Thank you so much for the trouble.

270
00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:20.991
No problem.

271
00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:26.191
So, what's this odd mail you're talking about?

272
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:28.091
Well that's...

273
00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:35.291
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

274
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.891
Sorry...

275
00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:39.391
The stuff I wanna show is...

276
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:44.891
This, Mr. Mailman.

277
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:46.491
A gun?

278
00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:47.491
Hey!

279
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:50.691
The guys back there come up front here with your hands in the air!

280
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:53.691
We're here to rob this place!

281
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:55.191
Hurry it up!

282
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:57.191
You too! Get with it!

283
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:01.691
Quit taking your time!

284
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:04.891
Okay, take it all out, the cash.

285
00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:06.791
It's right before pay day

286
00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:09.091
so I'll bet you're loaded!

287
00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:10.591
I see.

288
00:15:10.591 --> 00:15:13.291
So that's why you chose today,

289
00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:16.291
that would overlap with the Tokyo Spirits parade.

290
00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:17.691
Today, when the employees at the post office

291
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:19.291
would be reduced because it's a Sunday.

292
00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:21.691
You sent faxes and used bombs to deceive the police

293
00:15:21.691 --> 00:15:24.391
into thinking it had something to do with the bomb case three years ago,

294
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:26.591
and lured the police out.

295
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:31.191
Then, you make it look like a bad prank towards the Spirits

296
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.591
in order to divert the police attention.

297
00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:37.791
After diverting the police attention,

298
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:40.591
you attacked the post office using the mail truck you hi-jacked.

299
00:15:40.591 --> 00:15:44.491
Well, it's not such an intelligent idea though.

300
00:15:44.491 --> 00:15:46.191
Hey, you over there!

301
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:48.091
Cut out your babbling!

302
00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:50.891
Hurry it up and get up here!

303
00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:52.391
So, he says.

304
00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:54.291
Hurry all of you.

305
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:57.891
Come on, hurry.

306
00:16:01.391 --> 00:16:04.191
Hey, what's going on?

307
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:05.791
Why...

308
00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:08.991
Why are there so many of you, when it's a Sunday?

309
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:10.991
Oh, didn't you know?

310
00:16:12.091 --> 00:16:13.691
Although we all belong to civil service,

311
00:16:13.691 --> 00:16:17.291
we're not like the post office employees who have regular days off.

312
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:20.891
We're on duty 24 hours 365 days a year.

313
00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:23.691
That's how it is for us, the police officers!

314
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.791
Police?

315
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.091
Inspector Megure!

316
00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:30.191
We've taken custody of all the mailmen we found tied up

317
00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:31.591
in the mail trucks!

318
00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:32.791
Good!

319
00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:33.791
You jerk.

320
00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:35.391
Cut it out.

321
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:42.391
Because your way of thinking isn't wise.

322
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:47.391
Darn it.

323
00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:53.291
So, the post office robbers were arrested.

324
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.691
The other robbers who set bombs at different places

325
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:03.391
and were waiting for the others to return

326
00:17:03.391 --> 00:17:07.491
were all safely arrested.

327
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:09.491
And, that night...

328
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:13.891
But, it's a wonder you figured out

329
00:17:13.891 --> 00:17:15.391
that the bomber's real target

330
00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:17.191
was robbing the post office.

331
00:17:17.191 --> 00:17:18.491
Well, not really...

332
00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:22.691
The kids dropped the hint.

333
00:17:22.691 --> 00:17:24.291
You mean Conan, right?

334
00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:26.991
He's no ordinary kid after all!

335
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:28.691
Very true.

336
00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:30.291
Oh, right.

337
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:32.291
I'm sorry about this afternoon,

338
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.591
for slapping you all of a sudden like that.

339
00:17:34.591 --> 00:17:35.891
I'll bet it hurts.

340
00:17:35.891 --> 00:17:37.291
Oh, no.

341
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:40.591
I'm to blame for not following orders.

342
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:43.691
Are you all right, Officer Sato?

343
00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:45.291
The burn on the palm of your hands.

344
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:47.891
I'm fine. Though it still hurts a bit.

345
00:18:07.091 --> 00:18:09.291
Although it still kind of stings

346
00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:11.291
but I guess it will heal soon.

347
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.891
I guess so! I'm glad.

348
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.491
Excuse me...

349
00:18:24.491 --> 00:18:25.591
Officer Sato?

350
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:27.291
What?

351
00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:30.391
You mentioned earlier that you wanted to talk to me.

352
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:33.091
Oh, that.

353
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.891
Officer Sato.

354
00:18:41.991 --> 00:18:44.791
Let's call off the date we were planning!

355
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.791
What?

356
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.791
I'm cursed.

357
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:50.091
Cursed?

358
00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:56.391
Because all the people that I cherish vanish from before me.

359
00:18:56.391 --> 00:18:58.291
My father,

360
00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:00.891
my P.E. teacher in elementary school,

361
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:04.991
my senior in the baseball club and...

362
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:11.091
And, him too.

363
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:18.891
I don't want to go through anything like that ever again.

364
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.291
Officer Sato.

365
00:19:22.091 --> 00:19:24.091
So, I'd rather we stay like we are now,

366
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.291
colleagues at the police station.

367
00:19:28.991 --> 00:19:31.591
Officer Sato...

368
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:34.591
Officer Takagi?

369
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:44.391
That's the way to go! Go for it, Takagi!

370
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:46.191
Go! Go!

371
00:19:46.191 --> 00:19:48.191
Go for it, Takagi!

372
00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:58.091
You guys are sort of heavy.

373
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.891
Officer Sato. I...

374
00:20:04.991 --> 00:20:06.091
Officer Takagi?

375
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:11.891
I will never...

376
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:23.991
Right.

377
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:27.391
You and me, we don't really work out to begin with.

378
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:28.591
Right...

379
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:32.391
I think someone cuter is way better for you!

380
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:34.591
You think so?

381
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:35.991
Yes...

382
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:39.291
You coward.

383
00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:43.091
Bye for now then!

384
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:48.691
Officer Sato.

385
00:20:53.491 --> 00:20:55.091
Officer Sato.

386
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:55.291
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

387
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.391
You look kind of pale.

388
00:22:57.391 --> 00:22:59.391
Are you eating right?

389
00:22:59.391 --> 00:23:03.191
Let's hurry up and start questioning the people

390
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:04.991
about the post office robbery.

391
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:07.291
It seems he's still hasn't recovered

392
00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:09.991
from the last time he was brushed off.

393
00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:11.491
Come now, Ai.

394
00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:13.291
Why do you know about it?

395
00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:16.191
Hey, Takagi! How is it?

396
00:23:16.191 --> 00:23:17.891
If you're not feeling up to it,

397
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:19.091
I can take over questioning for you!

398
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:20.291
Oh, no, well...

399
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:23.491
Hey! Takagi, your shoulder sure is stiff!

400
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:26.191
Takagi! Want some coffee?

401
00:23:26.191 --> 00:23:28.991
If you're hungry, there are rice crackers, Takagi!

402
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.791
-Here... -Thank you.

403
00:23:31.791 --> 00:23:35.291
Amazing! Officer Takagi's really popular, isn't he?

404
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:42.691
Well, it's not quite right...

405
00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:48.991
"Next Episode" -But when we got there,

406
00:23:48.991 --> 00:23:52.191
the person was really surprised and looked pale!

407
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:55.891
The person couldn't have be acting!

408
00:23:55.891 --> 00:23:58.891
I wonder if that story is true...

409
00:23:58.891 --> 00:24:01.691
It's pretty unbelievable, isn't it?

410
00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:04.391
A mistake?

411
00:24:04.391 --> 00:24:06.491
I figured out who the culprit is!

412
00:24:06.491 --> 00:24:07.791
-What? -What?

413
00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:11.891
Next Conan,

414
00:24:11.891 --> 00:24:15.991

415
00:24:16.659 --> 00:24:19.159
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:20.959
"Recycle"

417

The next episode is the last broadcast for this year.

418
00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:24.559
-We, the officers... -Will really go all out...

419
00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:25.959
