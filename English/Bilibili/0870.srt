1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.610
We came to visit the villa of Dr. Agasa's friend

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.610
to spend time here.

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.510
Then we found

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.410
a wounded man called Yuji Isehara.

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.310
Isehara was a hacker as well as a henchman

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.610
for a robber aka Zorro who professed to be chivalrous.

7
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.610
I saved Isehara in the nick of time before he was going to

8
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.810
be murdered for being a traitor.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.210
But they persistently pursued us, and we...

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.110
Conan!

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.510
What? Conan?

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.810
Conan!

13
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.910
Die!

14
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

15
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.310
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

16
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.810
Serial robber and arsonist, Zorro.

17
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.010
While overcoming a close call, we'll beat him to a pulp!

18
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.510
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.410
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.010
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:25.367
"Conan Disappears Over a Cliff (Part 2)"

22
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:41.267
Guys!

23
00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:46.067
Ran! Conan's...

24
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:47.467
Conan's...

25
00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.267
It's not true. It can't be true.

26
00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:54.367
But we saw it, didn't we?

27
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:57.967
We witnessed with our own eyes

28
00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:00.567
that Conan fell off from there.

29
00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:06.367
Yes, we did.

30
00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:08.367
I saw it with my own eyes

31
00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:11.067
that Conan fell off the cliff.

32
00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:13.367
No.

33
00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:14.667
No!

34
00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.367
Conan...

35
00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:19.067
Why? Why?

36
00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:21.567
What's going on, Inspector?

37
00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:24.267
It's Zorro. He's responsible for this.

38
00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:25.667
What?

39
00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.467
From what the children said,

40
00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.067
we found out that the man who fell with Conan over the cliff

41
00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:33.567
was Yuji Isehara.

42
00:04:33.567 --> 00:04:36.567
But after the two fell over the cliff,

43
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.667
Zorro seems to have disappeared along with his henchmen.

44
00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:43.567
They probably had a brawl or something among themselves,

45
00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.867
and Conan got mixed up in it.

46
00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:50.767
But yet, why would the kid be together with Isehara?

47
00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:53.267
I have no idea.

48
00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:54.867
Anyway, the first thing we'll do in the morning

49
00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:56.767
is to ask Kanagawa Police Department

50
00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:58.367
to do a search over the sea.

51
00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.867
Right now!

52
00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.867
Please start right now, Inspector!

53
00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:04.567
I... I understand.

54
00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:06.867
-Hey! -Yes, sir...

55
00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:08.367
Darn it!

56
00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:09.867
This can't be.

57
00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:12.367
This can't be happening!

58
00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:15.467
Dad...

59
00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:33.167
"Kanagawa Prefectural Police, Misakihama Station"

60
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.067
Don't worry. Don't worry.

61
00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:40.367
I'm sure that Conan will be fine.

62
00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.467
Let us all wait for him.

63
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.667
Okay? -Okay.

64
00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.967
-Yeah. -Yes.

65
00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:48.167
Okay?

66
00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:54.567
How is it, Inspector?

67
00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.967
Three hours have already passed since they've started the search,

68
00:05:57.967 --> 00:06:01.467
but they've found nothing yet.

69
00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:02.867
I see.

70
00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:08.667
According to the local police,

71
00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.267
the water below the cliff is pretty deep

72
00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:13.167
and the flow is rapid.

73
00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:14.267
And anyone who falls in

74
00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:18.767
would be washed to the sea in no time at all.

75
00:06:18.767 --> 00:06:21.367
They say that corpses are rarely found too.

76
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:22.867
What...

77
00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:25.667
At any rate, we'll ask them to keep up the search.

78
00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.967
If anything comes up, they'll contact us immediately.

79
00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:30.567
I understand.

80
00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:32.467
Although Conan's safety is important,

81
00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:34.367
but depending on Isehara's condition when we find him,

82
00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:36.967
Zorros's case may hit a snag.

83
00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:40.467
But I won't let that happen

84
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.167
no matter what it takes.

85
00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:45.367
Inspector.

86
00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:58.567
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

87
00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:00.967
I saw him fall over the cliff.

88
00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:08.267
But I didn't see his corpse.

89
00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:20.167
I'm sure this was the place.

90
00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:55.167
Is this a cave?

91
00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.367
Sea breeze?

92
00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:04.267
Which means that up ahead, it's...

93
00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:15.567
If I remember correctly...

94
00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:24.367
Which means this is right below that cliff.

95
00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:02.467
Wait. I said, wait.

96
00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:05.067
"Yuji Isehara (28), Hacker" -Shut up. Don't follow me.

97
00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:08.367
I don't have time to be playing detective with a kid.

98
00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:09.667
Sheesh.

99
00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:12.367
We fell off that cliff and made it out safely without getting hurt,

100
00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:14.267
and you're not even thanking me?

101
00:09:14.267 --> 00:09:17.067
Spare... Spare me.

102
00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:18.367
Please.

103
00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:21.267
You're causing us so much trouble.

104
00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:23.667
Traitor.

105
00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:24.867
Die!

106
00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:40.667
If this is right above that cave...

107
00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:43.767
It's sink or swim.

108
00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:45.367
I've got no other choice.

109
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:47.467
Judging from the height of the cliff,

110
00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.767
if I match the timing with the waves that hit the rocks...

111
00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:53.467
Now!

112
00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:07.767
Hurry! Go beyond.

113
00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:10.167
Darn, I know!

114
00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:21.467
You have no intention of turning yourself in, do you?

115
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:22.767
Of course not.

116
00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:26.467
I heard there was a guy in the past who told on Zorro's hideout,

117
00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:28.967
but Zorro pursued him all the way abroad,

118
00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:31.467
and got rid of him.

119
00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:33.967
Even if I turn myself in,

120
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.267
I'd eventually...

121
00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:44.967
But you can't keep running around like this forever.

122
00:10:44.967 --> 00:10:47.267
That's what I'm trying to think out right now!

123
00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:52.367
If so, wouldn't it be faster to get Zorro

124
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:53.767
before he gets you?

125
00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:55.667
What a stupid thing to say.

126
00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:58.667
Well, you'd need somebody to help you though.

127
00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:07.067
"ZR-Stunt Co."

128
00:11:10.567 --> 00:11:12.667
A sale for precious metals and jewelries

129
00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:15.167
by the purveyors for the nouveau riche.

130
00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.867
"Go Mizorogi (35)" -Once a month,

131
00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:18.767
"Armed Robber Zorro" -this event is held at the same place.

132
00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:21.767
How much is it worth?

133
00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:23.467
Unlike going from house to house,

134
00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.467
we'll make a fortune by just busting into one place.

135
00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:28.967
We're guaranteed to make at least a total of one billion yen.

136
00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:30.667
What about the security?

137
00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:32.267
The norm.

138
00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:35.667
We can undo it with Isehara's software as usual.

139
00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:38.667
No problem at all.

140
00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:41.667
Speaking of Isehara, what an idiot he was.

141
00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.367
He chickened out

142
00:11:43.367 --> 00:11:45.867
and fell upside down into hell.

143
00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:48.967
That means we'll get to split his share among us, too.

144
00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:50.167
Right, Zorro?

145
00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:56.267
What do you want to do about it?

146
00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.967
We can sign a new contract if you want.

147
00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:03.667
We'll carry out as scheduled tonight.

148
00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:05.767
Get ready now.

149
00:12:35.534 --> 00:12:37.334
Ai is missing, too?

150
00:12:37.334 --> 00:12:38.734
What do you mean?

151
00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:40.134
I don't know.

152
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.234
By the time I noticed, she was already gone.

153
00:12:42.234 --> 00:12:44.434
Don't tell me that Ai...

154
00:12:44.434 --> 00:12:45.834
Got caught by them, too?

155
00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:48.734
Sheesh. What exactly is going on?

156
00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:51.934
Why is everybody doing as they please one after the other?

157
00:12:51.934 --> 00:12:55.034
There's something more important right now, Dad!

158
00:12:55.034 --> 00:12:56.634
I know!

159
00:12:56.634 --> 00:12:57.834
Inspector.

160
00:12:57.834 --> 00:12:59.134
Start the search immediately!

161
00:12:59.134 --> 00:13:00.234
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

162
00:13:24.334 --> 00:13:27.434
I came alone just like you told me to.

163
00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:37.434
I thought that it was done for when we hit the water,

164
00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:39.734
but I'm glad that I got through to you.

165
00:13:39.734 --> 00:13:42.134
More importantly, don't you have something to say?

166
00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:45.634
Yeah.

167
00:13:45.634 --> 00:13:48.534
Sorry. I had to make them think that we died.

168
00:13:48.534 --> 00:13:50.934
Otherwise, his family would've been in danger.

169
00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:57.734
Spare... Spare me.

170
00:13:57.734 --> 00:14:01.034
Please spare me.

171
00:14:01.034 --> 00:14:03.834
For your wife and child?

172
00:14:03.834 --> 00:14:06.234
What a soap opera.

173
00:14:08.634 --> 00:14:11.234
You talked, didn't you?

174
00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:15.134
I... I didn't say anything!

175
00:14:15.134 --> 00:14:18.134
I'll let you choose, then.

176
00:14:18.134 --> 00:14:21.334
Either you let me get rid of your wife and child

177
00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:24.134
or die here alone.

178
00:14:24.134 --> 00:14:26.234
Whichever you like.

179
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.334
Come on.

180
00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:42.334
Well, I don't mind,

181
00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:45.234
but you've got to explain this to them yourself later.

182
00:14:46.634 --> 00:14:48.234
I know.

183
00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:51.734
Did you bring what I asked you to bring?

184
00:14:51.734 --> 00:14:53.234
Yes, yes.

185
00:14:59.134 --> 00:15:00.634
All right!

186
00:15:02.934 --> 00:15:05.634
Hey, handle it nicely.

187
00:15:05.634 --> 00:15:08.034
It took me two months to make it, you know.

188
00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:13.534
Wow. You're able to make a program like this.

189
00:15:13.534 --> 00:15:16.834
Elementary school kids nowadays sure are amazing.

190
00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:19.834
Well, I used to be the same before.

191
00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:24.934
"Program access form"

192
00:15:26.934 --> 00:15:28.334
I thought so.

193
00:15:28.334 --> 00:15:32.134
They've already started undoing the security system of their target

194
00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:33.734
using my software.

195
00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:38.234
So he wanted the password to confirm that after all.

196
00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:40.434
Then the other one is for...

197
00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:43.834
More importantly,

198
00:15:43.834 --> 00:15:46.334
we've got to stop Zorro from committing his next crime.

199
00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:49.534
Where is Zorro planning to attack?

200
00:15:49.534 --> 00:15:52.134
The Beika City Central Event Hall.

201
00:15:52.134 --> 00:15:53.934
Okay. Let's call the police.

202
00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:55.134
Okay.

203
00:16:02.334 --> 00:16:05.334
"ZR-Stunt Co"

204
00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:22.034
"Communication Controls, Memory Controls, Security Controls"

205
00:16:31.534 --> 00:16:37.434
"7th Crown Jewel Exhibition and Sale Party"

206
00:16:46.434 --> 00:16:48.034
Finished setting the left side.

207
00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:53.034
Finished setting the right side.

208
00:16:53.034 --> 00:16:54.934
All set.

209
00:16:54.934 --> 00:16:57.734
Three, two, one.

210
00:16:57.734 --> 00:16:58.734
Go!

211
00:17:22.534 --> 00:17:23.634
Let's go.

212
00:17:37.434 --> 00:17:38.434
What?

213
00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.234
I've been waiting for you, Zorro.

214
00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:57.434
Too bad, tonight's party is canceled

215
00:17:57.434 --> 00:18:00.134
because we knew that you'd be coming, Zorro.

216
00:18:00.134 --> 00:18:02.534
-This can't be. -We heard voices just a while ago.

217
00:18:02.534 --> 00:18:04.534
Shut up!

218
00:18:04.534 --> 00:18:07.834
Voices? Do you perhaps mean this?

219
00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:21.734
So, that's what it was.

220
00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:24.734
I remember now! He's the kid we saw back then.

221
00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:26.534
He's still alive.

222
00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:28.634
Which means that that guy is alive, too.

223
00:18:28.634 --> 00:18:30.034
Hey, little boy.

224
00:18:30.034 --> 00:18:31.534
Just what are you talking about?

225
00:18:31.534 --> 00:18:34.034
We're just plain stuntmen.

226
00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:36.734
We were asked to perform at tonight's party.

227
00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:38.834
It's useless playing dumb!

228
00:18:40.634 --> 00:18:42.334
You can come in now.

229
00:18:46.934 --> 00:18:48.134
Just as I thought.

230
00:18:48.134 --> 00:18:50.334
But I'm sure we saw him fall down back then.

231
00:18:50.334 --> 00:18:52.634
What on earth is going on?

232
00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:55.934
Who cares!

233
00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:59.134
Then just die here once more!

234
00:18:59.134 --> 00:19:02.134
Go Mizorogi aka Zorro.

235
00:19:03.234 --> 00:19:06.934
I'm arresting you on charges of armed robbery, arson and murder!

236
00:19:06.934 --> 00:19:08.634
You two are equally guilty!

237
00:19:08.634 --> 00:19:10.334
Surrender yourselves!

238
00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.834
Okay. Let's go, Isehara.

239
00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:31.634
Yes, sir.

240
00:19:35.134 --> 00:19:36.534
Just as I thought.

241
00:19:36.534 --> 00:19:38.334
I'll go and confirm it.

242
00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:52.234
Yes, this is Megure.

243
00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:54.234
Dr. Agasa.

244
00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:57.734
You were fantastic this time.

245
00:19:57.734 --> 00:20:00.934
What? There's still something more?

246
00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:08.934
You really worked it out well, didn't you, Mr. Isehara?

247
00:20:08.934 --> 00:20:10.134
What?

248
00:20:10.134 --> 00:20:12.134
The fact is, she's not your wife

249
00:20:12.134 --> 00:20:14.434
and the child isn't yours either.

250
00:20:14.434 --> 00:20:16.834
You processed a picture you found on the internet,

251
00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:18.834
and made it look like a picture of your family.

252
00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:21.134
You used it as a tool to trick Zorro

253
00:20:21.134 --> 00:20:24.334
into thinking you had a weak point so that he would trust you.

254
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:27.434
You were after the cash

255
00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:30.534
that he stole and saved up to begin with.

256
00:20:30.534 --> 00:20:32.634
Then you found his secret bank account

257
00:20:32.634 --> 00:20:34.634
and the account number for it,

258
00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:36.534
and fled from him back then.

259
00:20:36.534 --> 00:20:38.034
That was when...

260
00:20:45.534 --> 00:20:46.934
Just as I thought.

261
00:20:46.934 --> 00:20:50.734
They've already started undoing the security system of their target

262
00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:52.434
using my software.

263
00:20:52.434 --> 00:20:54.634
Where is Zorro planning to attack?

264
00:20:54.634 --> 00:20:58.234
Oh... The Beika City Central Event Hall.

265
00:20:58.234 --> 00:21:00.234
Okay. Let's call the police.

266
00:21:00.234 --> 00:21:01.334
Okay.

267
00:21:10.534 --> 00:21:12.534
Conan and Ai figured it out.

268
00:21:12.534 --> 00:21:14.934
It was indeed the password to remotely control an overseas account

269
00:21:14.934 --> 00:21:18.034
and transfer all at once the entire account

270
00:21:18.034 --> 00:21:19.734
to your own account.

271
00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:21.234
This was because you assumed

272
00:21:21.234 --> 00:21:26.134
that you'd be going free way sooner than Zorro.

273
00:21:26.134 --> 00:21:27.934
Am I wrong?

274
00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:34.334
Well, it's amazing how you figured all that out, Dr. Agasa.

275
00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:36.134
We contacted Interpol

276
00:21:36.134 --> 00:21:38.534
and froze that account.

277
00:21:38.534 --> 00:21:42.534
So you won't be able to withdraw a cent from it, Isehara.

278
00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.234
It's finally over.

279
00:23:24.234 --> 00:23:26.234
No, not quite yet.

280
00:23:28.734 --> 00:23:31.234
Don't fight.

281
00:23:31.234 --> 00:23:33.434
Conan...

282
00:23:33.434 --> 00:23:35.434
Well...

283
00:23:35.434 --> 00:23:38.234
I'm sorry I made all of you worry.

284
00:23:38.234 --> 00:23:39.834
I'm sorry!

285
00:23:39.834 --> 00:23:41.734
-Don't run! -You're sorry?

286
00:23:41.734 --> 00:23:43.834
You're really...

287
00:23:54.734 --> 00:23:56.834
"Next Episode" -In that case,

288
00:23:56.834 --> 00:23:59.234
I have some place I want to go.

289
00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:02.034
We are the Origami Squadron...

290
00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:04.434
the Nobuna Gaizers...

291
00:24:07.234 --> 00:24:09.434
A local hero show.

292
00:24:09.434 --> 00:24:13.334
I guess the heroes have some sort of lineage with Nobunaga Oda.

293
00:24:13.334 --> 00:24:16.634
Are the people of Nobuna Gaizer here?

294
00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:20.334
Next Conan,

295
00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:23.134
"Nobunaga 450 (Yongomaru) Case"

296
00:24:24.577 --> 00:24:27.177
Next Conan's Hint:

297
00:24:27.177 --> 00:24:29.377
"Nobunaga Gaizers"

298
00:24:29.377 --> 00:24:30.477
As an apology for worrying us...

299
00:24:30.477 --> 00:24:31.777
-A game software. -A stuffed animal.

300
00:24:31.777 --> 00:24:32.777
Super special eels over rice.

301
00:24:32.777 --> 00:24:34.177
What?
