1
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.940
All right, let me introduce her.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.740
She will be joining our class as of today.

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.140
This is Sera.

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.340
Sera?

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.240
A transfer student?

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.040
What the... she's wearing a skirt.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.340
A girl?

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.940
My name is Masumi Sera.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.240
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.840
If all cases were men,

11
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.640
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

12
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340
The Mouri Detective Agency is being targeted.

13
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.440
What's the demand of the culprit who holed himself up?

14
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

17
00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:41.378
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Outbreak)"

18
00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:43.578
So, say...

19
00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.978
Sera, where do you live?

20
00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:49.178
Well, for right now I'm living at a hotel, I guess.

21
00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:50.878
Where are you from?

22
00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:54.578
I'd been living with my parents in America since three years ago,

23
00:02:54.578 --> 00:02:56.778
but I rebelled, saying that I'd rather live in Japan

24
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:58.578
where I was born and raised,

25
00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.578
so I came back to Tokyo.

26
00:03:00.578 --> 00:03:03.778
It's easier to be a detective here, too.

27
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:05.778
So you're a detective, Sera?

28
00:03:05.778 --> 00:03:07.778
A female Kudo.

29
00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:08.778
Kudo?

30
00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:10.478
The pride of Teitan High here,

31
00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:12.778
he's a high school detective.

32
00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:14.678
A renowned detective.

33
00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:17.478
Although, right now he's in leave of absence.

34
00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:24.478
Sera sure is popular, right?

35
00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:25.678
You're right.

36
00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:28.878
She's cheerful, sociable, boyish, and cute.

37
00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:30.278
On top of it,

38
00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:33.278
she's a female detective who uses Jeet Kune-Do

39
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:34.678
and evenly-matched with you.

40
00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:37.378
Maybe she's a tomboy too.

41
00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:40.778
Well, the only thing that's left to be desired are her small breasts.

42
00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.978
I'm sorry for being flat-chested then.

43
00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:45.578
But...

44
00:03:45.578 --> 00:03:47.578
My mom's bosoms are pretty huge,

45
00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:50.478
so mine should eventually develop, right?

46
00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:52.278
I guess...

47
00:03:52.278 --> 00:03:53.478
You're right.

48
00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:57.978
Anyway, is it true that Conan is living at Mr. Mouri's place?

49
00:03:57.978 --> 00:04:00.478
Yes, it's true.

50
00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:02.778
Then is it all right if I came over?

51
00:04:02.778 --> 00:04:06.278
Sure, but if I recall, today Conan is...

52
00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:07.978
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Oh, no.

53
00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:10.078
He just left now?

54
00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:12.878
Was it to that Dr. What's-his-name's house?

55
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.978
Yes, since they're going camping early tomorrow morning,

56
00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:19.678
he said he's staying over there with the other brats tonight.

57
00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:22.678
Darn. By the slightest of margins?

58
00:04:22.678 --> 00:04:24.678
Who is this girl?

59
00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:26.278
Sera, a transfer student.

60
00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:27.678
She says she's a detective.

61
00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:31.078
A female high school detective?

62
00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:34.878
Then, have you heard of the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri here?

63
00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.878
Yes. Sleeping Kogoro, right?

64
00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.678
When I checked the Japanese news via the internet,

65
00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:42.478
your name came up frequently.

66
00:04:42.478 --> 00:04:46.278
Sera said she was living in America up until recently.

67
00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:50.778
I read that you've resolved tons of difficult cases.

68
00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:52.578
Yes, got that right.

69
00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:55.478
And the one who's always with you

70
00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.978
is Conan Edogawa, isn't it?

71
00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:00.578
Yes... well...

72
00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:05.278
So then, why don't you have dad tell you all about his cases?

73
00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:08.478
You'd think so, but I can't remember most of them.

74
00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:12.678
As a detective, I'd love to hear some stories

75
00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:14.378
but it can wait until next time.

76
00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:18.178
I'll listen to all there is to say when Conan is around.

77
00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:21.678
About your stories,

78
00:05:21.678 --> 00:05:25.278
please tell us every single detail.

79
00:05:26.378 --> 00:05:27.478
"Tamami Mitsui (41)" -The three of us

80
00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:30.478
are popular female mystery writers.

81
00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:33.678
"Shinobu Yuchi (36)" -And we're friends who met via SNS.

82
00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:35.078
"Sumika Nihei (39)" -We were told that we could hear

83
00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:39.078
the stories of the Great Detective Mouri if we came here today.

84
00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:41.778
Didn't you hear about it from Mr. Sawaguri?

85
00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:44.678
Well, first of all, what is SNS?

86
00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.178
Social Networking Service.

87
00:05:47.178 --> 00:05:48.478
The stuff on the internet

88
00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:51.278
where you can communicate with a variety of people.

89
00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:54.478
Excuse me, could that Ms. Sawaguri you're referring

90
00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:58.778
to be the mystery writer Miku Sawaguri who passed away last month?

91
00:05:58.778 --> 00:06:02.478
Yes, she was also one of our SNS buddies.

92
00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:05.478
But the one who invited us here today is...

93
00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:07.978
her elder brother...

94
00:06:07.978 --> 00:06:10.078
Right.

95
00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.078
"Isao Sawaguri (37)" -Yours truly.

96
00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:15.478
Mr. Sawaguri.

97
00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:16.778
What's going on?

98
00:06:16.778 --> 00:06:20.178
It seems they haven't heard of the arrangement.

99
00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:22.078
But of course.

100
00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:31.178
Cause I never made an appointment.

101
00:06:31.178 --> 00:06:33.778
Each of you, put your cell phones on the desk

102
00:06:33.778 --> 00:06:35.578
and go to the far wall now.

103
00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:37.878
-What's this? -All about?

104
00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:40.378
Don't mess around. Do it now!

105
00:06:40.378 --> 00:06:42.578
-Yes. -Yes...

106
00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:47.578
I'll take the feet.

107
00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:48.978
You, the gun.

108
00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:52.878
And we'll overpower that guy, okay?

109
00:06:52.878 --> 00:06:53.878
Hey.

110
00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:55.478
Once you've put it down, get going!

111
00:06:55.478 --> 00:06:56.678
Yes, yes.

112
00:07:05.178 --> 00:07:06.378
Hey, you.

113
00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:08.278
What the heck is this about?

114
00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:10.378
Better let go.

115
00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:16.478
I did hear you have a daughter who is adept at karate, but...

116
00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.878
Never thought there'd be two of them.

117
00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:23.678
I was right to come with these strapped on.

118
00:07:27.778 --> 00:07:35.278
Now... Let's hear your brilliant deduction, Sleeping Kogoro.

119
00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:41.278
Then, that detective named Sera,

120
00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:45.278
knew your name as well as the fact that you were a detective?

121
00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:46.478
Yes.

122
00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:49.478
Well, he could just be a fan who became interested

123
00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:52.278
after learning about you from the papers and such.

124
00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:56.578
Besides, you were the one who figured out the truth

125
00:07:56.578 --> 00:07:58.478
of the case in the end, weren't you?

126
00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.978
So much for being a detective.

127
00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:01.778
You're right.

128
00:08:01.778 --> 00:08:03.078
Although I somehow feel

129
00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:05.578
as if that wannabe already figured out the truth,

130
00:08:05.578 --> 00:08:09.378
made a mistake on purpose in order to get me to deduce it.

131
00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:10.378
Hold on.

132
00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:11.978
You went ahead and began your deduction

133
00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:15.978
using Shinichi Kudo's voice in front of someone that suspicious?

134
00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:19.378
Well... I couldn't think of anything else to do.

135
00:08:19.378 --> 00:08:22.678
Besides, rather than being an enemy,

136
00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:26.278
somehow it feels like we've met somewhere before.

137
00:08:26.278 --> 00:08:29.678
Perhaps that person resembles someone I know

138
00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:32.578
that's why I feel as if we've met before.

139
00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.678
What's on your mind, exactly?

140
00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:36.078
No.

141
00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:37.378
Speaking of on my mind,

142
00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:39.378
the high school student that Ran was with...

143
00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:43.578
Yes, some guy we don't know, right?

144
00:08:43.578 --> 00:08:46.078
Ran was with a guy you don't know?

145
00:08:46.078 --> 00:08:47.278
We saw them across the street from us

146
00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.078
when we were coming here.

147
00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.078
But, wasn't that person a girl?

148
00:08:52.078 --> 00:08:53.478
Was it or not?

149
00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:55.178
If that's on your mind,

150
00:08:55.178 --> 00:08:57.478
why don't you call and find out?

151
00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:03.778
The loud noise just now was from a detective drama,

152
00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:07.778
the volume got stuck for a bit, but we got it fixed.

153
00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:11.678
Yes, I do apologize for the trouble.

154
00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:14.478
All right, that's fine.

155
00:09:14.478 --> 00:09:16.378
Now, great detective,

156
00:09:16.378 --> 00:09:18.778
you'll grant my wish.

157
00:09:22.978 --> 00:09:24.678
That's my cell phone.

158
00:09:24.678 --> 00:09:27.978
Darn. You didn't turn it off?

159
00:09:27.978 --> 00:09:29.478
If you make the wrong move and turn it off,

160
00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:30.678
they'll suspect you.

161
00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:31.778
What?

162
00:09:31.778 --> 00:09:34.478
The other side knows it's turned on and ringing,

163
00:09:34.478 --> 00:09:36.478
so if no one picks it up, they may worry

164
00:09:36.478 --> 00:09:38.778
and come to check on her.

165
00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:42.678
I think it's best to just answer appropriately, and then hang up.

166
00:09:42.678 --> 00:09:44.578
Guess so.

167
00:09:44.578 --> 00:09:48.278
But in exchange, if you even let slip one word...

168
00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:49.978
We know already.

169
00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:52.978
Hello.

170
00:09:52.978 --> 00:09:55.178
Ran? It's me.

171
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.878
Did I call at a bad time?

172
00:09:56.878 --> 00:09:58.678
It's all right.

173
00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:01.178
It's just that I was in the restroom.

174
00:10:01.178 --> 00:10:03.378
Well, it's not a big deal,

175
00:10:03.378 --> 00:10:05.178
but Genta and the others

176
00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:08.778
told me that you were walking with some guy they didn't know.

177
00:10:08.778 --> 00:10:12.278
Walking with some guy they didn't know?

178
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.878
I guess you mean the one who just transferred today...

179
00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:16.378
It was me!

180
00:10:17.378 --> 00:10:18.778
Why her?

181
00:10:18.778 --> 00:10:21.078
So now you know,

182
00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.578
just enjoy camping tomorrow.

183
00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:26.378
That should do it, right?

184
00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:30.278
Put the phone back on the desk and move back.

185
00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:31.278
Sure thing.

186
00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:35.778
Regardless...

187
00:10:35.778 --> 00:10:38.378
the request you just spoke of...

188
00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:40.878
Can you tell it to us again?

189
00:10:40.878 --> 00:10:42.778
It was kinda complicated,

190
00:10:42.778 --> 00:10:45.778
so I couldn't quite catch on hearing it only once.

191
00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:48.478
Hey. So who was that guy?

192
00:10:48.478 --> 00:10:51.178
-Please tell us. -Conan.

193
00:10:52.978 --> 00:10:55.278
This cell phone...

194
00:10:55.278 --> 00:10:57.278
is still connected.

195
00:10:57.278 --> 00:11:00.378
Geez, very well.

196
00:11:00.378 --> 00:11:02.078
I'll explain it once more,

197
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.178
so you'd better listen up.

198
00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:06.478
My sister Miku Sawaguri,

199
00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:07.578
was a best selling author

200
00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:10.778
who won the Naomoto Award when she was still young.

201
00:11:10.778 --> 00:11:12.678
But last month she killed herself by slitting her wrist

202
00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:13.878
at a Gunma hot spring inn, or so,

203
00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:16.278
the freaking police said.

204
00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.878
However, I swear it wasn't suicide.

205
00:11:20.878 --> 00:11:25.478
She was killed by one of the three who went to the hot spring with her.

206
00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:27.778
As for something that might be of evidence

207
00:11:27.778 --> 00:11:29.278
I've brought it here.

208
00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:34.178
So I want you to solve it, Sleeping Kogoro,

209
00:11:34.178 --> 00:11:36.978
with your brilliant deduction.

210
00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:39.978
Well, you don't have to worry.

211
00:11:39.978 --> 00:11:43.978
Once the culprit is found, I'll kill the witch

212
00:11:43.978 --> 00:11:46.578
and disappear to the other side myself as well.

213
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:48.578
What?

214
00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:53.678
Although, there is a limit to how long I can stay awake.

215
00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:55.678
Come tomorrow morning,

216
00:11:55.678 --> 00:11:58.678
these bombs will go off, though.

217
00:12:00.078 --> 00:12:01.678
What now?

218
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.970
So what the man wanted solved

219
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.170
was the truth behind the suicide of his sister,

220
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.670
mystery writer Miku Sawaguri?

221
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.370
What's more, that man has bombs on him,

222
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.570
and intends to commit murder-suicide with the culprit

223
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.170
once he finds out who, right?

224
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.770
Yes, that man also said...

225
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.670
that it'll explode in the morning,

226
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.370
so the bombs may be time bombs.

227
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.370
No way.

228
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.670
Ran is there too, isn't she?

229
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.270
Aren't they in big trouble?

230
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.170
Haibara, does it say online what hot spring inn it was

231
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.670
that Miku Sawaguri supposedly committed suicide at?

232
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.370
Yes, the date of the incident was last month on the 4th.

233
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:52.170
And there are photos of the three novelists who went there with her.

234
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.070
That inn...

235
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.870
It seems that man who's locked himself inside the detective agency

236
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.370
was also there as well.

237
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.970
"Isao Sawaguri (37)" -Since he, who was staying in the next room,

238
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.770
seem to have been the primary discoverer of the body.

239
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.070
He got an email from his sister saying goodbye,

240
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.970
thought it strange and went to knock on the door,

241
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.470
but received no response.

242
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.170
Without a choice, he broke the window via her balcony

243
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.970
and entered her room

244
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.470
to find that it had been enshrouded in steam.

245
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.570
And with her slit wrist soaked in the bathtub,

246
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.170
his sister was found dead holding tightly

247
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.570
onto her room key and cell phone,

248
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.770
according to his testimony.

249
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.570
The entrance door to the room was not an auto-lock type,

250
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.370
but the one that requires the turning of the key.

251
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.270
So basically it was a perfectly sealed room, wasn't it?

252
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.970
Then, why did that man insist it was a murder?

253
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.770
Could the name of the inn happen to be Furitsukaya?

254
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.770
Yes.

255
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.670
So it's the same hot spring inn the owner of Poirot went to

256
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.070
last month with people from the neighborhood association.

257
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.170
-What? -What?

258
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.570
Do you know who's in the neighborhood association?

259
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.570
Yes, because the owner sent me the photo

260
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.470
of everyone who was there back then.

261
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.070
Then, you guys go and find the people in the photo

262
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.070
except the owner, and ask about

263
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.870
what those three were up to before and after the incident.

264
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.870
-Yes. -Yes.

265
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.570
But, what about the owner?

266
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.070
The owner is in the coffee shop Poirot,

267
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.470
which is directly beneath the detective agency.

268
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.870
We'll call the police

269
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.770
to evacuate the owner and the customers,

270
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.670
so do not go anywhere near there no matter what.

271
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.470
But isn't she something?

272
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.770
Your girl at the detective agency.

273
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.270
She stuck her strap mascot in the cell phone

274
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.270
and then pretended that she'd hung up the phone

275
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.170
in order to keep the connection, right?

276
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.670
No, it wasn't Ran who did that.

277
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.770
Somehow that person is also at the detective agency,

278
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.170
the one we spoke about...

279
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.470
That detective named Sera.

280
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.370
All right, Kogoro Mouri.

281
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.270
Isn't it about time you enlighten me about the truth behind this case?

282
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.770
Which of the three people here killed my little sister?

283
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.270
But look here,

284
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.270
according to this copy of the newspaper,

285
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.870
the scene was a perfect sealed room.

286
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.870
What's more, the one who proved it was yourself,

287
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.170
the primary discoverer of the body.

288
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.670
Where are you getting that it was a murder?

289
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.770
I heard a sound.

290
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.970
When I found my sister passed out

291
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.870
and called an ambulance with my cell,

292
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.570
I heard a crunchy sound near the window.

293
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.970
So, I checked out the window,

294
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.970
and saw some small glass fragments

295
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.070
on the balcony outside of the window.

296
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.370
But I broke the glass of the window from the outside,

297
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.670
so isn't that weird?

298
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.470
That must be proof

299
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.270
that the culprit was hiding somewhere in the room,

300
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.870
waited until my attention was on my sister

301
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.470
and snuck out from that broken window.

302
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.070
But are you sure those fragments

303
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.070
weren't from your stepping on them before going outside the window?

304
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.070
Since you were in a rush to look around.

305
00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.670
The police said the same thing,

306
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.470
but I know I never stepped outside the window back then.

307
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.270
Are you the type to act without considering the consequences

308
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.770
when things get intense?

309
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:12.470
Yes, my buddies often say that I'm a quick-tempered guy.

310
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.770
In that case, your deduction may not be completely off the mark.

311
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.170
For these ladies who knew about you,

312
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.270
could have taken advantage of your apparent personality.

313
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.970
Plus, just take a look.

314
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.970
The photo I took before the police came.

315
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.070
You see the bloody finger marks on the bathmat there

316
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.070
in front of the bathroom door?

317
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.070
Sure... looks to be so.

318
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.570
That's probably

319
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.470
since my sister had her wrist slit by the culprit in the bathroom,

320
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.070
and struggled with all her might to escape.

321
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.370
Thus, left these bloody marks.

322
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.470
Otherwise, how would the blood have gotten all the way over there.

323
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.870
But, to suspect those three just from that...

324
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.970
Before the incident occurred,

325
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.370
all three of them had been to my sister's room.

326
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.470
Isn't that right?

327
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.270
Yes.

328
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.270
Including Miku, the four of us had made a pact,

329
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.570
that the first person who hit one million sales

330
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.270
would treat the others to a hot spring trip.

331
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.770
Since it was Miku who had become a bestselling author.

332
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.670
We were hyping over SNS about how we might

333
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.670
as well have her sign the first edition books

334
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.670
she'd given us of her debut work at the inn.

335
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.370
That's why we each went to visit her at her room that day.

336
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.370
Though, it seems that the three of us

337
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.270
coincidentally missed each other in passing.

338
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.470
You've brought those books with you, no?

339
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.570
Yes.

340
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.770
Incidentally, how did you get them to bring those books here?

341
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.470
I lied to them about you and my sister being acquaintances.

342
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.770
Telling them that if they wanted to hear your stories,

343
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.370
they'd have to bring those books

344
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.070
as proof that they were my sister's close friends.

345
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.670
Here, take a look.

346
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.670
She even dated her autograph.

347
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.670
It's proof that these three met with my sister

348
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.670
on the date of the incident.

349
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.370
In addition, my sister posted live updates via SNS

350
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.070
of what was happening at the time.

351
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.570
Here's a copy of those postings.

352
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.270
However, if these people were all SNS buddies,

353
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.570
wouldn't they have seen those postings?

354
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:12.470
No, my sister used my ID to post them discreetly.

355
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.770
So that these people wouldn't see them.

356
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.670
That reminds me, when I went to her room.

357
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.870
She kept texting on the phone.

358
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.070
So she was actually posting?

359
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.270
Anyway, read it.

360
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.870
Let's see.

361
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.270
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

362
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.970
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

363
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.970
that pesky Elephant.

364
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.270
What is this Elephant?

365
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.870
My sister made a hobby out of comparing people to animals.

366
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.270
Just read on, will you?

367
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.270
Next to come was Fox.

368
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.570
Trying to stir up an argument again,

369
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.770
freaking annoying.

370
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.870
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

371
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.870
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

372
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.170
I'll make short work of the autograph

373
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.170
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

374
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.070
Darn, she's still here.

375
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.070
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

376
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.070
What should I do?

377
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.070
And it seems the postings end there.

378
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.170
So, you got it, right?

379
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.370
That my sister, who left such postings,

380
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.670
wouldn't have any reason to commit suicide.

381
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.970
And that one of these three here was the last to see my sister,

382
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.170
put her to sleep,

383
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.070
and kill her while making it look like suicide,

384
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.170
that goddamned Rat.

385
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.070
Elephant, Fox, and Rat?

386
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.770
We got to figure out the criteria the late Miku used

387
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.070
to assign those nicknames, or else.

388
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.070
If you want the profiles of those three novelists,

389
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.570
there are details along with their photos.

390
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.170
Are those three people that famous?

391
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.170
No, all three of them

392
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.570
merely upload novels online as a hobby,

393
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.770
and are amateurs who occasionally create a coterie magazine to sell.

394
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.270
They call themselves novelists uploaded websites,

395
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.070
that's why they were listed.

396
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.670
Tamae Mitsui is 41 years old,

397
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.770
never married, and has been helping

398
00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:59.870
at her family's stone dealer's business.

399
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.270
She's a Taurus, blood type A.

400
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.370
Shinobu Yuchi is 36, and divorced once.

401
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.570
She's been working at her neighbourhood bakery

402
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.670
for close to 20 years, a Pisces, type B.

403
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.070
Sumika Nihei, age 39,

404
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.770
her husband is a seal cutting craftsman,

405
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.970
and in her spare time, as a housewife,

406
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.870
she writes mysteries, a Leo, type O.

407
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.170
Incidentally, I also looked up Miku's elder brother Sawaguri,

408
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.370
Turns out he was the leader of a survival games team,

409
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.070
the team's name is Green Cap.

410
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.470
A parody of the US Army's Special Forces Green Berets?

411
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.070
Just going by how these people look,

412
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.470
I'd say Elephant would be Mitsui,

413
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.870
Rat would be Yuchi,

414
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.770
and Fox would be Nihei, but...

415
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.970
It's too early to say for sure not a lot of info to go on.

416
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.470
As far as those three...

417
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.570
We've brought some answers.

418
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.970
The whole scoop!

419
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.770
You should be thankful to these children.

420
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.970
They bustled about the whole town in the Beetle, gathering info.

421
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.170
So, what'd you find out?

422
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.570
The lanky woman with the glasses is an extremely polite person.

423
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.370
We heard that she willingly tidied up

424
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.770
after some kids she didn't know scattered shampoo

425
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.970
and conditioner here and there.

426
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.270
The short woman with the overbite loves hot springs.

427
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.970
It seems she went into the hot springs many times a day.

428
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.270
The most suspicious one is the fat woman.

429
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.570
She was rushing out of the dead lady's room with a pale face.

430
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.970
According to a guy who saw her from his slightly-opened door.

431
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.970
Was the guy who witnessed that

432
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.170
in the room directly opposite from the late Miku's?

433
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.170
No, he was in the room three rooms away

434
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.970
from hers on the same side.

435
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.470
When he was about to leave his room,

436
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.970
he said that woman ran towards him with a scary look,

437
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.970
so he immediately shut the door.

438
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.670
We even brought a picture of the commotion that happened after that.

439
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.470
We're told that it's a picture of when the police arrived to room 205,

440
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.670
the scene of the suicide.

441
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.770
So no one told this to the police?

442
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.970
Apparently people did,

443
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.370
but they were told by Inspector Yamamura

444
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.770
that since the scene is a sealed room, that is irrelevant.

445
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.470
That's right.

446
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.670
The Gunma Prefectural Police has that hack on the force.

447
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.270
Hey... why is this phone still connected?

448
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.070
Darn, he found out.

449
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.870
Darn.

450
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.770
Trying to play smart with me, little witch.

451
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.070
You've got quite the nerve.

452
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.370
You do know what's going to happen, right?

453
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.970
Hold it. It wasn't her, the one who did it was...

454
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.070
It was me.

455
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.870
I was the one who made her do it.

456
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.770
Shinichi Kudo did.

457
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.370
Shinichi.

458
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.770
Why is he on Conan's phone?

459
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.270
First to come was the Special Investigation Team

460
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.170
made up of the Criminal Investigation Department First Division,

461
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.470
abbreviated as SIT.

462
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.170
I'm convinced that someone among these three

463
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.470
is the Rat who killed my sister.

464
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.770
Looks like we'll have to use an alternative method.

465
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.270
This guy... Don't tell me...

466
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.370
Now.

467
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.870
Shoot.

468
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.370
Next Conan,

469
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.433
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Sniping)"

470
00:24:37.547 --> 00:24:39.547
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:39.547 --> 00:24:41.847
"Bush warbler".

472
00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:44.547
Excuse me, will you show me Sleeping Kogoro?

473
00:24:44.547 --> 00:24:45.547
Well, let me see.

474
00:24:45.547 --> 00:24:46.109
Don't know.
