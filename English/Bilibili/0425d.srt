1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,040
What? You don't know?

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,241
What do you mean?

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,043
Wasn't he scheduled to go golfing?

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,244
Well.

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,246
He cancelled it yesterday.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,750
Something about he suddenly promised to meet someone.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,452
Then, contact him quickly!

8
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,254
And tell him not to meet anyone

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,956
because his life is in danger!

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,761
We get a lot of calls like yours.

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,262
But no need to worry.

12
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:33,867
Mr. Domon is strong and he has two bodyguards accompanying him.

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,568
Please don't worry.

14
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,871
Please excuse me because I've other things to attend to.

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,572
Hey, wait!

16
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,742
It seems he took your call to be a prank.

17
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,045
-No way! -Well, it really can't be helped, though...

18
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,347
Darn it.

19
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:52,952
We've to locate Edie P which is the other hint we have.

20
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:57,457
That announcer who's supposed to be interviewing Mr. Domon.

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,159
Where is she now?

22
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,164
About 18 km southeast from here.

23
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,467
That's just around Nichiuri TV station in Shiodome.

24
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,970
She's probably going to join the crew there and go with them.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,741
A phone call?

26
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,446
What's up?

27
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,448
Just confirming.

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,053
I have a very wary and persistent personality.

29
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,555
Don't worry.

30
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,457
Everything's fine.

31
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,858
I'm going to join the crew

32
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,061
and head for Edie P on the TV station wagon now.

33
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,763
The rain has cleared.

34
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,965
And it's turned out to be a great day for hunting.

35
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,366
Kir.

36
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,168
I've been thinking from this morning,

37
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,572
Your phone's very static.

38
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,842
Yeah. Maybe because I'm in the basement?

39
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,944
I answered the phone in the basement this morning too.

40
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,546
Okay, Gin.

41
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,548
We'll go on ahead then!

42
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,951
Hey, Chianti!

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,452
Good luck.

44
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,263
I'll kill her!

45
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,965
I'll kill!

46
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,666
I'll kill her for sure!

47
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,070
I hate Vermouth too.

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,073
Calvados used to love her.

49
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,443
She used him to her advantage.

50
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,044
That's why I hate her.

51
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:29,249
Yes. I would've killed her long ago if I had my way.

52
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,552
And that woman was not our boss' favorite.

53
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,363
Darn it!

54
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,564
We have less than 30 minutes to go

55
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,767
before the assassination time that they mentioned!

56
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,770
Edie P...

57
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,171
Where on earth is it?

58
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,640
Edie P!

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,145
I think we should head over to the TV station too, don't you?

60
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,747
Yes, I agree.

61
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,350
We're not getting anywhere wasting our time here.

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,753
Even if we were to locate their hunting ground.

63
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,356
If we're too far away from the TV station wagon,

64
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,958
we can't possibly beat them to it.

65
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,965
Hunting ground.

66
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,367
Come to think of it, Vermouth was saying.

67
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:26,272
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

68
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,841
What? What do you mean?

69
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:35,348
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

70
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,150
History.

71
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,451
Oh, a phone call?

72
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,552
It's mine.

73
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,056
Well...

74
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,657
This sound is...

75
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,259
Conan's cell phone.

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,462
Hello?

77
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,164
What do you mean, hello?

78
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,267
Gosh. How dare you hang up on me like that?

79
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,570
I'm sorry, Ran.

80
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,872
If this horse comes, it'll be a big win!

81
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,242
Please put Dr. Agasa on the phone!

82
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,944
It's already our turn to ride the Ferris Wheel!

83
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,446
So I'll call you again later!

84
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,547
Hey, Conan!

85
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,249
Geez!

86
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,150
Oh, cool kid!

87
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,153
It's like you have dual personality!

88
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,955
Dual personality?

89
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,257
Wait a second.

90
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,458
Hunting ground.

91
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,659
History.

92
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,960
Park.

93
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,362
Dual personality!

94
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,367
You're cleaning up?

95
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,469
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

96
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,170
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

97
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,273
How nostalgic.

98
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,743
I see! Dr. Agasa!

99
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,846
Take a left at that traffic light over there and get on the freeway!

100
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,547
The freeway?

101
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,149
If we go on the freeway,

102
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,653
we'll be driving away from Nichiuri TV, you know?

103
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,454
It's okay.

104
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,156
Because we're beating them to the hunting ground.

105
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,759
Beat them to it?

106
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,260
Don't tell me that...

107
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,561
Yeah.

108
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,764
I finally figured it out!

109
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,368
The location Edie P that they're planning to assassinate Mr. Domon is...

110
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,771
Haido Park!

111
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,472
Haido Park?

112
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,142
But what makes you think Edie P is?

113
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,347
It flashed upon me when Ms. Jodie said "dual personality" a while ago.

114
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,651
That Eddie is the short form of Edward!

115
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,752
I see.

116
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,055
Edward Hyde.

117
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,157
Edward is the first name of a character

118
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,259
that appears in Stevenson's bizarre novel,

119
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,561
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".

120
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,565
Which means, Edie P stands for Haido Park!

121
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:36,669
I'm sure there was a parking space in that park, though.

122
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,770
No.

123
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,140
They mentioned that there was no better place for hunting.

124
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,143
In the real Hyde Park in London,

125
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:48,348
until around the 16th Century, deer and wolves existed

126
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,750
and it used to be the hunting ground of the nobles.

127
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,752
That's the hunting ground!

128
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,954
There's no mistake about it!

129
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,055
This is bad.

130
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,159
If we go as is, the TV station wagon will be there before us.

131
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,260
Dr. Agasa! Hurry!

132
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,562
Okay!

133
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,071
Hey, Gin.

134
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,340
Isn't Kir here yet?

135
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,043
I'm dying of boredom.

136
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:21,647
Hold it. She's on her way there while bringing DJ along with her.

137
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,952
Don't you dare hunt some other prey to get rid of your boredom now.

138
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,453
The same goes for Korn.

139
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,369
That boy.

140
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,972
And FBI agents!

141
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,440
Why?

142
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,541
Listen.

143
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,343
Only Ms. Jodie and me are going!

144
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,245
Both of you don't come out of the car, no matter what!

145
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,446
Okay.

146
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,447
Ms. Jodie!

147
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,356
We don't have time!

148
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,457
Where is it?

149
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,061
Sorry for all the trouble.

150
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,265
Thank you so very much for agreeing to our scoop interview.

151
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,467
No problem. Anytime.

152
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,769
Was this the place the interview is to be held?

153
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,870
Yes.

154
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,440
It's a wonderful park.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,643
It's my usual jogging course.

156
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,745
Well, at that time, my two bodyguards here

157
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,848
end up running with me though.

158
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,250
I wonder what's taking her so long.

159
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,852
Kir.

160
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,955
By the way, about the, you know what...

161
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,757
In place of my accepting this interview,

162
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:41,060
you'll approve of the condition I set forth too, won't you?

163
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,664
Yes. Of course.

164
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,165
I appreciate it.

165
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,869
Okay, Kir.

166
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,072
Guide DJ to the designated place.

167
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,242
This is going to be some heavy film.

168
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,445
Too bad it's not live broadcast.

169
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,347
90 m more!

170
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,249
Please make it in time!

171
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,451
We shouldn't just stand and talk.

172
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,353
Let's go some place where we can relax and talk.

173
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,554
True.

174
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,356
Well...

175
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,158
How about sitting on that bench over there?

176
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,061
Bench?

177
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,162
Great.

178
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,664
Good. That's right.

179
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,268
Let's get it over with as soon as possible, Mr. Domon.

180
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,470
What? Isn't that Mr. Domon?

181
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,571
What?

182
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,140
Amazing, he's for real!

183
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,942
Please shake hands with me!

184
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,546
It's fine.

185
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,747
I support you!

186
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,649
Please change Japan!

187
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,551
Oh, thank you!

188
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,355
I got him.

189
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,156
Can I shoot him?

190
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,058
Not yet, Korn.

191
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,960
There're too many sheep in the way.

192
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,564
Wait until DJ sits down on the bench.

193
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,170
There he is!

194
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,841
Hey. Isn't he Mr. Domon that appears a lot on TV?

195
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:02,942
For real?

196
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,149
But where's the snipers?

197
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,351
They were concerned about the rain.

198
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,452
So they're probably...

199
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,755
On the roof of a building!

200
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,356
Over there?

201
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,958
And the other one.

202
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,160
It's under the water tank.

203
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,963
I'll go save Mr. Domon.

204
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,965
So you go ahead and take the others to a safe place.

205
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:26,966
No.

206
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,869
If I carelessly charge in there and he fires at random,

207
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,571
he may hit the spectators in the area!

208
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,440
In order to prevent them from shooting.

209
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,142
In order to make them give the whole thing up.

210
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,047
Umbrella?

211
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,348
Well...

212
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,750
Let's shake hands after the interview.

213
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,955
How annoying.

214
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,456
Hold your horses

215
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,958
and wait.

216
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,962
There!

217
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,165
Sprinkler?

218
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,266
Hey, Ms. Jodie.

219
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,972
Do you have a gun?

220
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,015
Mr.Domon!

221
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,617
Thank you...

222
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,118
A gun?

223
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,587
Well, yes.

224
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,189
What about a silencer?

225
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,190
Yeah.

226
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,894
Then, will you shoot what I tell to shoot at?

227
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,897
But do it so no one notices!

228
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,099
So, like I said, let's shake hands later.

229
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,800
Mr. Domon!

230
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,502
I support you!

231
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,404
So please do your best!

232
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,505
Yeah.

233
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,009
Thank you!

234
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,016
Will films like this come in handy later during the election?

235
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,218
Yes, of course.

236
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,495
Understand, Korn?

237
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,397
I shoot his head!

238
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,699
And you shoot his back.

239
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,803
I want to shoot his head.

240
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,306
Okay! Suit yourself!

241
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,310
What's up, Kir?

242
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,412
Hurry and make DJ sit down!

243
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,614
Kir?

244
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,789
Mr. Domon?

245
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,291
It's about time we get the interview going.

246
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,594
Yes, I guess so.

247
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,003
Excuse me.

248
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,005
Will you all back off a bit?

249
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,207
We'd like to film the interview.

250
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,010
Sprinkler?

251
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,087
Rain?

252
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,605
Hey, come on. Give me a break.

253
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,007
Seriously?

254
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,212
Come on, and sit down.

255
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,314
Quickly!

256
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,517
Thanks.

257
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,694
DJ has a navy blue umbrella.

258
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,896
Can I shoot him?

259
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,197
Wait.

260
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,700
Shooting him through the umbrella will reduce accuracy.

261
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,902
But how strange.

262
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,004
It's not raining on this side.

263
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,787
It's begun raining on this side too.

264
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,598
It's really started raining.

265
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,300
Blessed rain.

266
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,314
Chianti.

267
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,216
Kir, Korn.

268
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,218
Withdraw for now!

269
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:16,689
I'll be waiting for you at the place in an hour.

270
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,090
Then...

271
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,192
Will you tell me?

272
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,799
The synopsis of the second part of the assassination scheme is?

273
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,303
We have no choice.

274
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,806
Let's continue the interview at the summerhouse within this park.

275
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,807
Yes.

276
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,308
Shall we get going then?

277
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,113
Excuse me. May we go with you too?

278
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,415
Yes, of course!

279
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,517
-Then, me too! -Same here!

280
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,894
Chance!

281
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,196
-Hurry up... -Wait...

282
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,397
I'd better get the transmitter and wiretap

283
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,599
that on the sole of her shoe now!

284
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,903
Okay! It's mine now!

285
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,509
Sonny?

286
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,811
I found it!

287
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,801
Don't tell me that you followed me here?

288
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,004
No. I didn't.

289
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,708
It's just a coincidence.

290
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,213
I see.

291
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,118
Thank you.

292
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,188
For picking my shoe up for me.

293
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,600
Thank you very much.

294
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,108
Director!

295
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,912
Could you substitute someone in my place to hold the interview?

296
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,914
-What? -I'm sorry.

297
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,017
I'm having trouble with my shoe since earlier.

298
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,819
Hey...

299
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,903
Gin.

300
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,913
The announcer found you?

301
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,414
No way!

302
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,417
Don't tell me she found out that we were tailing her.

303
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,687
No, I think I pulled through okay on that one.

304
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,790
She hasn't noticed the transmitter and wiretap either.

305
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,794
Then, why didn't you retrieve them?

306
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,995
All you had to do was tell her that

307
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,798
something was on the back of her shoe and take them.

308
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,302
Yeah. I thought of doing so too,

309
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,805
but she...

310
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,507
Thank you very much.

311
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,810
I sort of felt strange.

312
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,717
But thanks to you, we can pursue going after them!

313
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,888
Besides, there seems to be more to their assassination scheme.

314
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,189
Yeah.

315
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,192
Is it okay to leave things as they are?

316
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,997
The TV crew, that she brought along with her, are with him, aren't they?

317
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,299
The crew aren't involved in this!

318
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,802
She deliberately tried to find a reason

319
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,705
for acting on her own without the crew.

320
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,006
So my guess is...

321
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,508
Those guys are probably going to get together somewhere.

322
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,010
And get on with their next plan.

323
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,116
Well, leave the rest to us, FBI agents,

324
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,219
and you people get on going home with the Beetle.

325
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,590
I'm going to keep him with me for a while, though!

326
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,194
Then, how do you intend to pursue them without a car?

327
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,795
No problem.

328
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,803
My boss offered of his own initiative to be my driver.

329
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,696
Then, Dr. Agasa.

330
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,898
Smooth things out with Pops and Ran for me.

331
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,701
Invite them over to your place and make sure they don't find out anything.

332
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,102
Okay!

333
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,404
Just to be on the safe side,

334
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,807
we'll have two or three of our members stay on guard too.

335
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,609
Then, I'm counting on you!

336
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,412
Hey!

337
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,115
I'm sure you already know.

338
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,987
But your prime purpose is to retrieve the transmitter and wiretap!

339
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,390
If you hesitate because of curiosity or a sense of justice,

340
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,694
you may end up losing everything!

341
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,996
Yeah, I know.

342
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,200
You shot the sprinkler and broke it

343
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,001
to make them think that it started to rain,

344
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:41,905
and prevented those guys from going through with their plan

345
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:45,309
by making the crowd as well as the target to use their umbrellas.

346
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:50,881
It's no wonder you respect this boy.

347
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,784
I'd like to scout him to the bureau myself.

348
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,290
He's James!

349
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,493
You've met him once before, haven't you?

350
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,495
Conan.

351
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,297
The last I saw you was that Panda car incident?

352
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:10,200
You were a life saver then!

353
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,402
Panda?

354
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,904
What?

355
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,005
It's true!

356
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,207
James left behind for us.

357
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:21,678
I'm telling you that the code "P&A" means police car!

358
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,582
So, why does "P&A" mean police car?

359
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:29,987
Try changing the "&" in "P&A" into the alphabet!

360
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:31,688
Let's see.

361
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,391
P&A.

362
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,693
P and a, n, d and a.

363
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,196
Panda?

364
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,798
I see! Panda!

365
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,100
I see.

366
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,403
The color of a police car is black and white

367
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,604
Hey! Hurry!

368
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,706
Use the hostage as a shield and run for it!

369
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,008
Okay!

370
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:55,779
Help!

371
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,180
What the...

372
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,882
Officer!

373
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,784
Please help us!

374
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:06,290
Excuse me!

375
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,991
I'm Officer Takagi from headquarters!

376
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,094
Please help us arrest the kidnapper!

377
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:13,597
Darn it, that almost scared me.

378
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:17,501
Okay, after keeping them company for a while, take a side road!

379
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,705
Okay, got them!

380
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:25,208
Okay. It's about time we take a side road.

381
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:29,379
If there's no road to the left, take the right!

382
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:32,282
But...

383
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:34,484
There's another police car to the right too!

384
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:35,986
Then, reverse!

385
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:37,888
Slow down and reverse.

386
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:39,790
There's a police car behind too.

387
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,892
What?

388
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:44,695
Hey, we're completely...

389
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:47,197
surrounded by cops!

390
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:58,308
So, this James guy is also an FBI agent.

391
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:04,381
But why are they going after Yasuteru Domon who's not even a Dietman?

392
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:07,584
Probably because his father used to be a famous government official,

393
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,186
he's well known in the world of politics.

394
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:10,988
He's got charisma

395
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:14,992
and is a solid clump of righteousness.

396
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:18,895
Rumor already has it that he's a candidate for the future Prime Minister.

397
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:19,997
I see.

398
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:22,499
They want to get rid of anyone that is bound to resist against them

399
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,501
while still a bud.

400
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:28,605
That's how they work.

401
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:30,707
Besides, if they kill him now,

402
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:33,777
they can make it look like Kiriko Busujima did it.

403
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:35,278
Kiriko Busujima?

404
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:40,183
Yes. A woman executive of the Deisan Organization

405
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:44,488
that is suspected of having sent out a sniper to kill him.

406
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,989
I see.

407
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,296
Take a left at the next intersection.

408
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:56,199
Well? Anything from them?

409
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:59,403
No. Still too early for anything.

410
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,105
By the way,

411
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:04,508
do you know where Shuichi is?

412
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,979
Yeah. I'm looking for him too.

413
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:11,982
You explained this to him, didn't you?

414
00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:13,183
Yes.

415
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,987
Including info about the transmitter and wiretap that this boy set up.

416
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:19,389
This is what he said over the phone.

417
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,193
I see.

418
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,896
That's it.

419
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:29,499
I haven't heard a word from him since.

420
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:32,302
Ever since he lost his girlfriend,

421
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,905
it seems he's got a tendency to close up like a clam.

422
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:38,208
Not that he had an open heart to begin with, though.

423
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:41,878
I hear him.

424
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,979
This voice is...

425
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:50,087
At about 16:00, DJ will pass over and cross a bridge.

426
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,589
That's where he's going to be assassinated.

427
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:53,990
Gin!
