1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,040
What? You don't know?

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,240
What do you mean?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,040
Wasn't he scheduled to go golfing?

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,240
Well.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
He cancelled it yesterday.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,740
Something about he suddenly promised to meet someone.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,440
Then, contact him quickly!

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,240
And tell him not to meet anyone

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,940
because his life is in danger!

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,740
We get a lot of calls like yours.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,240
But no need to worry.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,840
Mr. Domon is strong and he has two bodyguards accompanying him.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,540
Please don't worry.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,840
Please excuse me because I've other things to attend to.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,540
Hey, wait!

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,740
It seems he took your call to be a prank.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,040
-No way! -Well, it really can't be helped, though...

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,340
Darn it.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,940
We've to locate Edie P which is the other hint we have.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,440
That announcer who's supposed to be interviewing Mr. Domon.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,140
Where is she now?

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,140
About 18 km southeast from here.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,440
That's just around Nichiuri TV station in Shiodome.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,940
She's probably going to join the crew there and go with them.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,740
A phone call?

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
What's up?

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Just confirming.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,040
I have a very wary and persistent personality.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,540
Don't worry.

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,440
Everything's fine.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,840
I'm going to join the crew

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
and head for Edie P on the TV station wagon now.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,740
The rain has cleared.

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,940
And it's turned out to be a great day for hunting.

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,340
Kir.

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,140
I've been thinking from this morning,

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,540
Your phone's very static.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,840
Yeah. Maybe because I'm in the basement?

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,940
I answered the phone in the basement this morning too.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,540
Okay, Gin.

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,540
We'll go on ahead then!

42
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,940
Hey, Chianti!

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,440
Good luck.

44
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,240
I'll kill her!

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,940
I'll kill!

46
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,640
I'll kill her for sure!

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,040
I hate Vermouth too.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Calvados used to love her.

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,440
She used him to her advantage.

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
That's why I hate her.

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,240
Yes. I would've killed her long ago if I had my way.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,540
And that woman was not our boss' favorite.

53
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,340
Darn it!

54
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,540
We have less than 30 minutes to go

55
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,740
before the assassination time that they mentioned!

56
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,740
Edie P...

57
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,140
Where on earth is it?

58
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,640
Edie P!

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,140
I think we should head over to the TV station too, don't you?

60
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,740
Yes, I agree.

61
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,340
We're not getting anywhere wasting our time here.

62
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,740
Even if we were to locate their hunting ground.

63
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,340
If we're too far away from the TV station wagon,

64
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,940
we can't possibly beat them to it.

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,940
Hunting ground.

66
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,340
Come to think of it, Vermouth was saying.

67
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,240
I guess there's no better place for hunting?

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,840
What? What do you mean?

69
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,340
You should at study a bit of their history too, Vodka.

70
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
History.

71
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,440
Oh, a phone call?

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,540
It's mine.

73
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,040
Well...

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
This sound is...

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Conan's cell phone.

76
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,440
Hello?

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,140
What do you mean, hello?

78
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,240
Gosh. How dare you hang up on me like that?

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,540
I'm sorry, Ran.

80
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,840
If this horse comes, it'll be a big win!

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,240
Please put Dr. Agasa on the phone!

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,940
It's already our turn to ride the Ferris Wheel!

83
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,440
So I'll call you again later!

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,540
Hey, Conan!

85
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,240
Geez!

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,140
Oh, cool kid!

87
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,140
It's like you have dual personality!

88
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,940
Dual personality?

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,240
Wait a second.

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
Hunting ground.

91
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,640
History.

92
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,940
Park.

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,340
Dual personality!

94
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,340
You're cleaning up?

95
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,440
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"

96
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,140
It's Jekyll and Hyde!

97
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,240
How nostalgic.

98
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,740
I see! Dr. Agasa!

99
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,840
Take a left at that traffic light over there and get on the freeway!

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,540
The freeway?

101
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,140
If we go on the freeway,

102
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,640
we'll be driving away from Nichiuri TV, you know?

103
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,440
It's okay.

104
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,140
Because we're beating them to the hunting ground.

105
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,740
Beat them to it?

106
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,240
Don't tell me that...

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,540
Yeah.

108
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,740
I finally figured it out!

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,340
The location Edie P that they're planning to assassinate Mr. Domon is...

110
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,740
Haido Park!

111
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,440
Haido Park?

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,140
But what makes you think Edie P is?

113
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,340
It flashed upon me when Ms. Jodie said "dual personality" a while ago.

114
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,640
That Eddie is the short form of Edward!

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,740
I see.

116
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,040
Edward Hyde.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,140
Edward is the first name of a character

118
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,240
that appears in Stevenson's bizarre novel,

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,540
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".

120
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Which means, Edie P stands for Haido Park!

121
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,640
I'm sure there was a parking space in that park, though.

122
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,740
No.

123
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,140
They mentioned that there was no better place for hunting.

124
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,140
In the real Hyde Park in London,

125
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,340
until around the 16th Century, deer and wolves existed

126
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,740
and it used to be the hunting ground of the nobles.

127
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
That's the hunting ground!

128
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,940
There's no mistake about it!

129
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,040
This is bad.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,140
If we go as is, the TV station wagon will be there before us.

131
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,240
Dr. Agasa! Hurry!

132
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,540
Okay!

133
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,040
Hey, Gin.

134
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,340
Isn't Kir here yet?

135
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm dying of boredom.

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,640
Hold it. She's on her way there while bringing DJ along with her.

137
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,940
Don't you dare hunt some other prey to get rid of your boredom now.

138
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,440
The same goes for Korn.

139
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,340
That boy.

140
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,940
And FBI agents!

141
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,440
Why?

142
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,540
Listen.

143
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,340
Only Ms. Jodie and me are going!

144
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,240
Both of you don't come out of the car, no matter what!

145
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Okay.

146
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Ms. Jodie!

147
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,340
We don't have time!

148
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,440
Where is it?

149
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
Sorry for all the trouble.

150
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,240
Thank you so very much for agreeing to our scoop interview.

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,440
No problem. Anytime.

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,740
Was this the place the interview is to be held?

153
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,840
Yes.

154
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,440
It's a wonderful park.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,640
It's my usual jogging course.

156
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,740
Well, at that time, my two bodyguards here

157
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,840
end up running with me though.

158
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,240
I wonder what's taking her so long.

159
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,840
Kir.

160
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,940
By the way, about the, you know what...

161
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,740
In place of my accepting this interview,

162
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,040
you'll approve of the condition I set forth too, won't you?

163
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,640
Yes. Of course.

164
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,140
I appreciate it.

165
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay, Kir.

166
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,040
Guide DJ to the designated place.

167
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,240
This is going to be some heavy film.

168
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
Too bad it's not live broadcast.

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,340
90 m more!

170
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,240
Please make it in time!

171
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,440
We shouldn't just stand and talk.

172
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,340
Let's go some place where we can relax and talk.

173
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,540
True.

174
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,340
Well...

175
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,140
How about sitting on that bench over there?

176
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,040
Bench?

177
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,140
Great.

178
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,640
Good. That's right.

179
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,240
Let's get it over with as soon as possible, Mr. Domon.

180
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,440
What? Isn't that Mr. Domon?

181
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,540
What?

182
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,140
Amazing, he's for real!

183
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,940
Please shake hands with me!

184
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,540
It's fine.

185
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,740
I support you!

186
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,640
Please change Japan!

187
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,540
Oh, thank you!

188
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340
I got him.

189
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,140
Can I shoot him?

190
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,040
Not yet, Korn.

191
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,940
There're too many sheep in the way.

192
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,540
Wait until DJ sits down on the bench.

193
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,140
There he is!

194
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,840
Hey. Isn't he Mr. Domon that appears a lot on TV?

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,940
For real?

196
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,140
But where's the snipers?

197
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,340
They were concerned about the rain.

198
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,440
So they're probably...

199
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,740
On the roof of a building!

200
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,340
Over there?

201
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,940
And the other one.

202
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,140
It's under the water tank.

203
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,940
I'll go save Mr. Domon.

204
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
So you go ahead and take the others to a safe place.

205
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
No.

206
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,840
If I carelessly charge in there and he fires at random,

207
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,540
he may hit the spectators in the area!

208
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,440
In order to prevent them from shooting.

209
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,140
In order to make them give the whole thing up.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
Umbrella?

211
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,340
Well...

212
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,740
Let's shake hands after the interview.

213
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,940
How annoying.

214
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,440
Hold your horses

215
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,940
and wait.

216
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,940
There!

217
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,140
Sprinkler?

218
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,240
Hey, Ms. Jodie.

219
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,940
Do you have a gun?

220
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,987
Mr.Domon!

221
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,587
Thank you...

222
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,087
A gun?

223
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,587
Well, yes.

224
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,187
What about a silencer?

225
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,187
Yeah.

226
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,887
Then, will you shoot what I tell to shoot at?

227
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,887
But do it so no one notices!

228
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,087
So, like I said, let's shake hands later.

229
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,787
Mr. Domon!

230
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,487
I support you!

231
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,387
So please do your best!

232
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,487
Yeah.

233
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:42,987
Thank you!

234
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:49,987
Will films like this come in handy later during the election?

235
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:52,187
Yes, of course.

236
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,487
Understand, Korn?

237
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,387
I shoot his head!

238
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:06,687
And you shoot his back.

239
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:10,787
I want to shoot his head.

240
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:13,287
Okay! Suit yourself!

241
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,287
What's up, Kir?

242
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:19,387
Hurry and make DJ sit down!

243
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:21,587
Kir?

244
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,787
Mr. Domon?

245
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:32,287
It's about time we get the interview going.

246
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,587
Yes, I guess so.

247
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:43,987
Excuse me.

248
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,987
Will you all back off a bit?

249
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,187
We'd like to film the interview.

250
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:23,987
Sprinkler?

251
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,087
Rain?

252
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,587
Hey, come on. Give me a break.

253
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,987
Seriously?

254
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,187
Come on, and sit down.

255
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,287
Quickly!

256
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:04,487
Thanks.

257
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:14,687
DJ has a navy blue umbrella.

258
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,887
Can I shoot him?

259
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,187
Wait.

260
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:20,687
Shooting him through the umbrella will reduce accuracy.

261
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,887
But how strange.

262
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,987
It's not raining on this side.

263
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,787
It's begun raining on this side too.

264
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,587
It's really started raining.

265
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:54,287
Blessed rain.

266
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,287
Chianti.

267
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:10,187
Kir, Korn.

268
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,187
Withdraw for now!

269
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:16,687
I'll be waiting for you at the place in an hour.

270
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,087
Then...

271
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,187
Will you tell me?

272
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:26,787
The synopsis of the second part of the assassination scheme is?

273
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:31,287
We have no choice.

274
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,787
Let's continue the interview at the summerhouse within this park.

275
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:34,787
Yes.

276
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,287
Shall we get going then?

277
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:41,087
Excuse me. May we go with you too?

278
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,387
Yes, of course!

279
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:44,487
-Then, me too! -Same here!

280
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:54,887
Chance!

281
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:57,187
-Hurry up... -Wait...

282
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,387
I'd better get the transmitter and wiretap

283
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,587
that on the sole of her shoe now!

284
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,887
Okay! It's mine now!

285
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:10,487
Sonny?

286
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,787
I found it!

287
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:35,787
Don't tell me that you followed me here?

288
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,987
No. I didn't.

289
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,687
It's just a coincidence.

290
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,187
I see.

291
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,087
Thank you.

292
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,187
For picking my shoe up for me.

293
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:07,587
Thank you very much.

294
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:16,087
Director!

295
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,887
Could you substitute someone in my place to hold the interview?

296
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,887
-What? -I'm sorry.

297
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,987
I'm having trouble with my shoe since earlier.

298
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,787
Hey...

299
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:43,887
Gin.

300
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,887
The announcer found you?

301
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,387
No way!

302
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:58,387
Don't tell me she found out that we were tailing her.

303
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:01,687
No, I think I pulled through okay on that one.

304
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,787
She hasn't noticed the transmitter and wiretap either.

305
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:08,787
Then, why didn't you retrieve them?

306
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:09,987
All you had to do was tell her that

307
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,787
something was on the back of her shoe and take them.

308
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:16,287
Yeah. I thought of doing so too,

309
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,787
but she...

310
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:21,487
Thank you very much.

311
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,787
I sort of felt strange.

312
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:31,687
But thanks to you, we can pursue going after them!

313
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:35,887
Besides, there seems to be more to their assassination scheme.

314
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,187
Yeah.

315
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:40,187
Is it okay to leave things as they are?

316
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:44,987
The TV crew, that she brought along with her, are with him, aren't they?

317
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,287
The crew aren't involved in this!

318
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,787
She deliberately tried to find a reason

319
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:52,687
for acting on her own without the crew.

320
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:53,987
So my guess is...

321
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:56,487
Those guys are probably going to get together somewhere.

322
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,987
And get on with their next plan.

323
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:04,087
Well, leave the rest to us, FBI agents,

324
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:07,187
and you people get on going home with the Beetle.

325
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,587
I'm going to keep him with me for a while, though!

326
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:15,187
Then, how do you intend to pursue them without a car?

327
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,787
No problem.

328
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:24,787
My boss offered of his own initiative to be my driver.

329
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:50,687
Then, Dr. Agasa.

330
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,887
Smooth things out with Pops and Ran for me.

331
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:55,687
Invite them over to your place and make sure they don't find out anything.

332
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:57,087
Okay!

333
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:58,387
Just to be on the safe side,

334
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,787
we'll have two or three of our members stay on guard too.

335
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,587
Then, I'm counting on you!

336
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:06,387
Hey!

337
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:10,087
I'm sure you already know.

338
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:14,987
But your prime purpose is to retrieve the transmitter and wiretap!

339
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,387
If you hesitate because of curiosity or a sense of justice,

340
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:21,687
you may end up losing everything!

341
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,987
Yeah, I know.

342
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:36,177
You shot the sprinkler and broke it

343
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:37,977
to make them think that it started to rain,

344
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,877
and prevented those guys from going through with their plan

345
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:45,277
by making the crowd as well as the target to use their umbrellas.

346
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:50,877
It's no wonder you respect this boy.

347
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:53,777
I'd like to scout him to the bureau myself.

348
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,277
He's James!

349
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:02,477
You've met him once before, haven't you?

350
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,477
Conan.

351
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:07,277
The last I saw you was that Panda car incident?

352
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:10,177
You were a life saver then!

353
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:12,377
Panda?

354
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,877
What?

355
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:14,977
It's true!

356
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,177
James left behind for us.

357
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:21,677
I'm telling you that the code "P&A" means police car!

358
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:25,577
So, why does "P&A" mean police car?

359
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:29,977
Try changing the "&" in "P&A" into the alphabet!

360
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,677
Let's see.

361
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:34,377
P&A.

362
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,677
P and a, n, d and a.

363
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:39,177
Panda?

364
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,777
I see! Panda!

365
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,077
I see.

366
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:46,377
The color of a police car is black and white

367
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,577
Hey! Hurry!

368
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,677
Use the hostage as a shield and run for it!

369
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:50,977
Okay!

370
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:55,777
Help!

371
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,177
What the...

372
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,877
Officer!

373
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:00,777
Please help us!

374
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,277
Excuse me!

375
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:07,977
I'm Officer Takagi from headquarters!

376
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:11,077
Please help us arrest the kidnapper!

377
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:13,577
Darn it, that almost scared me.

378
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:17,477
Okay, after keeping them company for a while, take a side road!

379
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,677
Okay, got them!

380
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:25,177
Okay. It's about time we take a side road.

381
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:29,377
If there's no road to the left, take the right!

382
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:32,277
But...

383
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:34,477
There's another police car to the right too!

384
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:35,977
Then, reverse!

385
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,877
Slow down and reverse.

386
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:39,777
There's a police car behind too.

387
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,877
What?

388
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:44,677
Hey, we're completely...

389
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:47,177
surrounded by cops!

390
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:58,277
So, this James guy is also an FBI agent.

391
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:04,377
But why are they going after Yasuteru Domon who's not even a Dietman?

392
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:07,577
Probably because his father used to be a famous government official,

393
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,177
he's well known in the world of politics.

394
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,977
He's got charisma

395
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:14,977
and is a solid clump of righteousness.

396
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:18,877
Rumor already has it that he's a candidate for the future Prime Minister.

397
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:19,977
I see.

398
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,477
They want to get rid of anyone that is bound to resist against them

399
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,477
while still a bud.

400
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:28,577
That's how they work.

401
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:30,677
Besides, if they kill him now,

402
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:33,777
they can make it look like Kiriko Busujima did it.

403
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:35,277
Kiriko Busujima?

404
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:40,177
Yes. A woman executive of the Deisan Organization

405
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:44,477
that is suspected of having sent out a sniper to kill him.

406
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:45,977
I see.

407
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:53,277
Take a left at the next intersection.

408
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:56,177
Well? Anything from them?

409
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:59,377
No. Still too early for anything.

410
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:02,077
By the way,

411
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,477
do you know where Shuichi is?

412
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:08,977
Yeah. I'm looking for him too.

413
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:11,977
You explained this to him, didn't you?

414
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:13,177
Yes.

415
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:16,977
Including info about the transmitter and wiretap that this boy set up.

416
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,377
This is what he said over the phone.

417
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,177
I see.

418
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:25,877
That's it.

419
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:29,477
I haven't heard a word from him since.

420
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:32,277
Ever since he lost his girlfriend,

421
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,877
it seems he's got a tendency to close up like a clam.

422
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:38,177
Not that he had an open heart to begin with, though.

423
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:41,877
I hear him.

424
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:42,977
This voice is...

425
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:50,077
At about 16:00, DJ will pass over and cross a bridge.

426
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:52,577
That's where he's going to be assassinated.

427
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:53,977
Gin!
