00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,710
Ten years ago while visiting the beach with my family,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,610
I met another family.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,110
While there, I got caught up in a car accident.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,810
Anyway, is it true

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,710
that there was another person in the car?

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,110
That's what he said.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,110
What proof do you have?

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,410
I simply thought there was another person

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,610
since the passenger window was open all the way.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,710
The driver's seat was on the right side.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,510
If there's only one person were in the car,

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,410
it would be strange for only the passenger window to be open.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,310
So they abandoned their friend

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,410
and fled alone.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,410
No.

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,010
This man wasn't wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,510
What?

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,410
He struck his head on the windshield

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,510
when the car crashed into the guardrail.

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,310
It broke his cervical vertebrae,

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,510
killing him instantly.

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,210
It's probably safe to assume the passenger determined he was dead

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,310
when they received no response after calling out to him,

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,610
so they decided to escape on their own.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,810
But why would they pretend to be one of the crowd here?

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,710
If they were a victim of an accident, they wouldn't need to hide.

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,810
Probably because

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,410
there was a reason they had

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,810
to conceal themselves.

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,810
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,210
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,410
The family on the beach and the car's fall

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,510
are both deeply shrouded in mystery!

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,110
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,010
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,610
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:42,867
"The Magician of the Waves (Part 2)"

38
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,267
A reason to conceal themselves?

39
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:59,267
Was there a robbery at a store

40
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,567
that sells watches in this area?

41
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:08,067
We did receive a report about an hour ago that two thieves

42
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:12,067
entered a watchmaker's shop about a kilometer from here.

43
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:14,767
How do you know about an incident

44
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,667
that hasn't been reported by the news yet?

45
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,467
There was a bag in the back seat of the sunken car.

46
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:24,867
It was packed full of brand-name watches

47
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,067
with their price tags still on them.

48
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:31,067
They could have been wholesalers

49
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,667
making a delivery.

50
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:35,167
Then they would've put them in plastic bags or boxes

51
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,967
so they wouldn't get damaged.

52
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,667
Only a thief concerned with stealing the watches

53
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:45,267
and escaping would so casually stuff them into a bag.

54
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:50,867
Did anyone see the faces of the thieves?

55
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:55,267
No. They were both wearing ski masks.

56
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,867
Based on their voices, we know one was a man,

57
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:01,567
but we don't know the gender of the other.

58
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,567
I see.

59
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,167
Hey, Mr. Pierrot!

60
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,167
I brought all the customers

61
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,967
who went shopping after the car fell into the ocean.

62
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,267
You're sure, right?

63
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,867
Yes.

64
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,567
This chubby man bought a T-shirt and swim trunks.

65
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,467
This woman bought sandals.

66
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,767
And this lanky guy bought a Hawaiian shirt.

67
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,867
What's the big deal, anyway?

68
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:32,567
It seems this man who was driving the car

69
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:35,567
that fell into the water had someone with him.

70
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:40,167
I'll be questioning each of you.

71
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:49,067
"Shigekatsu Fukumizu (32)" -My name is Shigekatsu Fukumizu.

72
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:52,167
I came here with my girlfriend.

73
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,467
When she suddenly brought up marriage

74
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:57,267
while we were on a rubber boat,

75
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:01,767
I told her it was too soon.

76
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,167
So she pushed me into the ocean

77
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,967
and my clothes were soaked.

78
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,167
By the time I returned to the boat, she was gone.

79
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,967
Only my wallet remained.

80
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,567
So I took off my soaking clothes

81
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,767
and bought a T-shirt and swim trunks.

82
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,467
Where is your girlfriend now?

83
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,067
She was pretty angry,

84
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:28,167
so she probably took the car home without me.

85
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,267
It's her car.

86
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,067
Where's the rubber boat?

87
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,567
Who knows?

88
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,567
Bringing it home with me would be a pain, so I abandoned it.

89
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,167
Maybe it drifted away.

90
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:48,167
"Yasue Kitamori (27)" -Yasue Kitamori is my name.

91
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,467
I came here to pick up guys,

92
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,267
but couldn't find any good ones.

93
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:57,367
On top of that, the straps on my sandals broke,

94
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,767
so I bought some new ones and was on my way home.

95
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,667
Well, I did get to swim quite a bit.

96
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:07,567
Where are the sandals with the broken strap?

97
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,967
I threw them away somewhere!

98
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,467
You're handsome.

99
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:19,267
How did you get here dressed like that?

100
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,767
I carried my wallet here and took a taxi.

101
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:25,167
I kept my wallet in a locker while swimming

102
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,967
and anything I needed could be bought here.

103
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,867
The less you're carrying,

104
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,567
the easier it is to go back to a guy's place.

105
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,967
You've got it all wrong!

106
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,467
Someone stole my bag!

107
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:43,567
"Raiya Oami (26)" -While I was showering after my swim,

108
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,867
someone took my bag!

109
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,167
That's why I'm only wearing a speedo.

110
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,267
I had no choice

111
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:54,967
but to buy a three thousand yen shirt from that beach hut.

112
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,467
They didn't take your wallet?

113
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:58,467
No.

114
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,267
I folded my wallet into my towel

115
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:04,367
while I was showering.

116
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,867
Oami, why did you come here?

117
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,567
Huh?

118
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,667
To hit on women.

119
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:17,567
Do you use those watches you have on both wrists to hit on women?

120
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:18,867
Yes.

121
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:23,367
This one's on Japan time, and this one's on New York time.

122
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,567
Fashionable, right?

123
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,167
Come on, Yukiko.

124
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:41,567
I told you not to call since I'd be writing until dinner.

125
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,867
Go enjoy yourselves at the beach.

126
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:45,867
What?

127
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:51,467
A car fell at the beach and the driver's dead?

128
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:55,667
Apparently he was a thief.

129
00:08:55,667 --> 00:09:00,767
His accomplice escaped from the sunken car

130
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:04,567
and they've blended in with the crowd on the beach.

131
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,667
If I send you photos of the three suspects,

132
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,967
can you tell me who did it?

133
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,967
I'm so curious.

134
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,567
She may be curious,

135
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,667
but I can't figure it out based on photos alone.

136
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,167
I see.

137
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,367
That's what I said!

138
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:31,667
Don't let anyone wet or wearing a swimsuit leave!

139
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,167
More people are leaving!

140
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,067
Masumi, that's enough.

141
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,467
Mom.

142
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:46,967
You know we can't get involved in a case.

143
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,467
It's not a problem.

144
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,267
Case closed.

145
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:55,567
All we have to do now is name the culprit.

146
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,467
Case...

147
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,167
Closed?

148
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,533
What? No way.

149
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,233
You know who did it?

150
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,733
But I only sent you photos of the three suspects.

151
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:22,933
Isn't that why you called me?

152
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,933
I thought I'd tell you more about the case

153
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:29,933
after I sent the photos.

154
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:33,533
Why don't you go ahead and tell me, then?

155
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,933
Okay.

156
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:38,333
I already told you that when the car fell into the ocean,

157
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,233
the driver died.

158
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:46,733
But the passenger escaped from the car,

159
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:51,033
and blended in with the crowd, right?

160
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:55,233
Yes. And that he's a thief.

161
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:59,033
The story was just posted online.

162
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,133
"Watchmaker Attacked! Robbers On The Run." -A watchmaker

163
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:03,333
was attacked by a pair of thieves,

164
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,033
and they're still on the run.

165
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,033
That's right.

166
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,133
We think one of them bought something

167
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:13,333
to pass themselves off as one of the crowd.

168
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,333
The three people who went shopping

169
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,833
at the beach hut after the car fell are our suspects.

170
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,233
The chubby man got soaked

171
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,333
when his girlfriend pushed him off a boat and into the ocean,

172
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,733
so he bought a T-shirt and swim trunks.

173
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,433
The young woman who came to pick up men

174
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:33,833
bought new sandals since the strap on hers broke.

175
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:39,133
The flashy guy who came to hit on women had his clothes stolen,

176
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,033
so he bought a three thousand yen Hawaiian shirt.

177
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,733
I see. I knew it.

178
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,733
Huh? Knew what?

179
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,233
The culprit is most likely the woman who bought the sandals...

180
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,433
The woman who bought the sandals...

181
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,233
Yasue Kitamori.

182
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:57,833
You were riding in the car that fell, weren't you?

183
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,433
What? No way.

184
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:02,033
Huh? Is it really that surprising?

185
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,333
Oh, no.

186
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,633
A young man on the beach just said the same thing.

187
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,533
Wait a minute.

188
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,533
How does buying sandals make me the culprit?

189
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,833
Look at how I'm dressed.

190
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,933
I obviously came here to swim.

191
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,933
Indeed.

192
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:24,633
If what you're wearing is actually a swimsuit, that is.

193
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:32,933
Are the clothes she's wearing not a swimsuit?

194
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,033
Probably not.

195
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,733
When she escaped from the sinking car,

196
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,633
she was wearing pants or a skirt.

197
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:44,833
She found herself on a public beach when she surfaced.

198
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,633
If she exited the water in what she was wearing,

199
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,833
she'd be exposed as the passenger in the car.

200
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:54,233
So in the water, she took off the pants or skirt she was wearing

201
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:58,233
and wrapped her scarf around her waist like a wrap-around.

202
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,233
Then she tied up the hem of her shirt

203
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,433
so she could pretend to be a swimmer.

204
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:08,133
But the other two guys could've done the same thing.

205
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,333
And the woman only bought sandals.

206
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:17,433
Actually, it's more accurate to say she could only buy sandals.

207
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:18,733
Why?

208
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,433
When she fell into the ocean,

209
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:24,233
her wallet was submerged and her bills got wet.

210
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,833
She could only use her change.

211
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,433
So I thought the woman who took off her wet shoes

212
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:35,333
and bought the sandals she could afford

213
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,433
with a single coin must be the culprit.

214
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,833
As you can see, unless you're right on the water's edge,

215
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,833
the sand's too hot to walk on barefoot.

216
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,633
She could've used her wet bills,

217
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:54,933
but the beach hut employees would've remembered someone like that.

218
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:58,833
And I doubt the beach hut accepts credit cards.

219
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,733
But she could've been wearing sandals

220
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,633
that are okay to get wet.

221
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,133
Did you forget?

222
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,133
There were thieves in the car.

223
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:16,133
On top of that, the robbery occurred just before the car fell.

224
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,933
If they were on the run,

225
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:21,233
it's hard to imagine she changed into sandals

226
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,233
that would be difficult to run in.

227
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,533
Right, Kitamori?

228
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,633
I'm sure that's a fake name, of course.

229
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:34,833
I see.

230
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,233
So the young man on the beach

231
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:41,633
is explaining exactly the same reasoning I told you.

232
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,733
How very interesting.

233
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,033
That's right.

234
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,533
Just like Sherlock Holmes would.

235
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,633
I can't see too well since he's wearing sunglasses,

236
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:52,033
but he seems pretty handsome, too.

237
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,333
Hey.

238
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,033
Anyway, how did you know?

239
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:01,633
You said you knew who did it

240
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,533
after only looking at the photos I sent you.

241
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:07,133
Oh, it was their watches.

242
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,533
Their watches?

243
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,633
Come to think of it, they were all wearing them.

244
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:15,833
The chubby man's watch was displaying 1:45.

245
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,533
The young man's watches both showed 2:00.

246
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:24,533
But the woman's watch was displaying 10:10.

247
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:28,333
That's one of the watches from the store that was robbed.

248
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:32,633
What? Isn't the woman's watch just broken?

249
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:37,333
I knew you're the thief, too.

250
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,833
You're wearing a watch you stole from the store.

251
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,133
What are you talking about, you brat?

252
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:47,133
Your watch is exactly like it was in the store.

253
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,433
Of course it is!

254
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,133
I bought it from a store!

255
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,733
But it's stopped at 10:10, right?

256
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:59,633
It probably broke when I went in the water.

257
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:02,133
What? You mean you don't know?

258
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:07,933
Watches sold in stores are generally stopped around 10:10,

259
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,933
so you can clearly see the name of the maker.

260
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,433
Is that true, Shinichi?

261
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,433
Yes.

262
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,433
I asked my dad about it at the watch area in a department store.

263
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:25,233
Brand-name watches have serial numbers.

264
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,533
If we look it up,

265
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:30,533
we'll know if that watch was stolen.

266
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,033
I see.

267
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:36,733
That's how he knew.

268
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,733
That went well.

269
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,133
Yes, piece of cake.

270
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,433
Once we sell the watches,

271
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,933
should we head to a tropical island?

272
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:49,033
Hey, don't steal the goods.

273
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,933
Put that watch back in the bag.

274
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:52,933
Huh?

275
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,533
What are you talking about?

276
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,133
I bought this the other day.

277
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,533
What are you doing?

278
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,133
Stolen goods can be tracked.

279
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,633
Put it back.

280
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,833
Put it back!

281
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,033
Look in front of you!

282
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,933
We broke through the guardrail and fell into the sea.

283
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:24,233
This must be what it means to hit rock bottom.

284
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,633
"End Call"

285
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,133
Shuichi.

286
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,433
Aren't you finished?

287
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,633
Let's go.

288
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,633
Sure.

289
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,133
So, have you changed your mind?

290
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,833
You said something about joining the FBI earlier.

291
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,933
No.

292
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,733
My desire has only grown stronger.

293
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:09,633
Don't tell me finding the thief who blended in with the crowd

294
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:12,733
has gotten to your head.

295
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,933
I'd be lying if I said it hasn't,

296
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:19,833
but I've tasted the thrill of solving a mystery.

297
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,933
If things go well,

298
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,633
I might even find the people who killed my father.

299
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,233
I'm afraid, Brother.

300
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,433
You seem like you've been possessed.

301
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,533
I'm not possessed.

302
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,233
I'm afflicted.

303
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:37,633
Huh?

304
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:41,533
By a fever known as curiosity.

305
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,633
Tsutomu.

306
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:50,033
He really is his son.

307
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,433
Shuichi, I wanted you to return to Japan,

308
00:18:55,433 --> 00:19:00,433
and be a father figure to Shukichi and Masumi,

309
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,233
but I've given up on that.

310
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,633
Go, Shuichi.

311
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:10,633
Let that fever drive you to clear

312
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:14,133
the mist obscuring the truth until you die.

313
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,633
But in exchange,

314
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,933
if you leave any haze behind, I won't forgive you.

315
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:23,833
That's what I always intended.

316
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,133
What's gotten into you, Mom?

317
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,333
You sound just like Dad.

318
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,933
It means starting today, I'm your father.

319
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,133
Hey.

320
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,033
The policeman's calling you.

321
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,633
He wants to ask you about the case again at the station.

322
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,933
I'll let you handle that.

323
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,733
You're the one who identified the truth about the watch.

324
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,333
That's right, but...

325
00:19:55,733 --> 00:20:01,633
After all, you're the apprentice of my country's greatest detective.

326
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,733
Your country?

327
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,033
You're English?

328
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:14,433
Yes. Although I'm an American now.

329
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:18,433
Anyway, did this case help you with your detective training?

330
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,433
Yes!

331
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,633
You were just like Holmes.

332
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:26,133
No way.

333
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:30,133
Holmes is even more amazing.

334
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:36,433
But I guess you're at least as good at Watson.

335
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:43,233
Dr. Watson, huh?

336
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,733
Great.

337
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,333
He smiled again.

338
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:53,533
See you later, Holmes's apprentice.

339
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,533
Hey, you.

340
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,333
You're a magician.

341
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:29,733
You're a magician...

342
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,033
You're a magician.

343
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,633
Huh? What?

344
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:41,733
Is there something on my face?

345
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:42,933
No.

346
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,033
Wait a minute.

347
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,533
Since Sera wore a swimsuit similar

348
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,533
to the one she wore ten years ago,

349
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:56,133
was she trying to help me remember that we met ten years ago?

350
00:22:57,233 --> 00:23:01,233
Does that mean she knows I'm Shinichi Kudo,

351
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:04,433
transformed into a child by a drug?

352
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:09,233
And then there's the brother between Sera and Akai.

353
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:11,933
That must be Meijin Haneda.

354
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,933
They were calling him Shukichi.

355
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,733
No, more importantly,

356
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:21,733
the face of the woman Meijin Haneda called Mary.

357
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,833
She must be the same person

358
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,633
as the sister from another domain that Sera mentioned.

359
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:35,933
Was she given APTX 4869 just like I was?

360
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:39,533
When? Where? By whom?

361
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:44,533
Looks like you remembered me from ten years ago,

362
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:47,133
but you still don't know the real reason

363
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:52,133
why I call you a magician.

364
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:58,533
"Next Episode" -But why'd they send that to me?

365
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,733
At dawn this morning, an explosion occured

366
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,333
at pachinko parlor Sandcastle located in Beika City, Tokyo.

367
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,133
Since a hint pertaining to the bomb was written on it,

368
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,033
the suspect Hirukawa tore it up.

369
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,933
Which means there are still other bombs?

370
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:15,533
We found it!

371
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,333
It's inside a bag in a trash can!

372
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:24,333
Next Conan, "The Pop-up Book Bomber (Part 1)"

373
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,176
Next Conan's hint:

374
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,376
"A pop-up book"

375
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:31,076
Conan, what do you and I have in common?

376
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:32,076
Magicians?

377
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:33,676
Don't you mean capable moms?
