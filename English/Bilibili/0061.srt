1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.690
A racing second hand, a shooting comet,
a wind-up doll, and a crowd!

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.020
Mystery-solving logic
drenches the walls of dry hearts!

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.180
Today's case is the
first original TV 2-parter!

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.850
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.060
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:13.325
Mayor! Hurry!

7
00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.195
What is that?

8
00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:18.525
Did last night's storm carry it here?

9
00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:19.985
That's!

10
00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:28.995
Ryujin-Maru

11
00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:33.445
Hey! Isn't that the boat
that was lost seven years ago?!

12
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.875
Get out there!

13
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:35.625
Right!

14
00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:46.155
There was 1 billion yen
in gold on that ship...

15
00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:50.745
Well?

16
00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:52.935
There's nothing onboard!

17
00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:55.775
That can't be!
Where did all the gold go?!

18
00:02:56.195 --> 00:03:00.695
Why do you suppose
it turned up only now?

19
00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.545
It's almost like a ghost ship.

20
00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:03.735
Ghost?!

21
00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:06.245
Could it be the Suigun curse?!

22
00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:11.035
You fools! There is no curse!
It's just a dumb superstition!

The Ghost Ship Murder Case (Part 1)

25
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:31.985
We'll land on Shikishima in three hours.

26
00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:33.275
Goro Kinoshita (53)
We greatly appreciate

27
00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:34.575
your coming all the way
Goro Kinoshita (53)

28
00:03:34.575 --> 00:03:34.635
to give a lecture!
Goro Kinoshita (53)

29
00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:38.065
to give a lecture!

30
00:03:38.065 --> 00:03:41.945
And it certainly is a long way!

31
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:43.025
Ouch!

32
00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:44.985
Say, Kinoshita-san!

33
00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:50.325
I hear a ship that went missing
with 1 billion yen in gold onboard

34
00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:52.245
recently turned up!

35
00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:56.915
Yes! People on the
island think it's a ghost ship!

36
00:03:56.915 --> 00:04:00.375
But the money never turned up?

37
00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:06.305
No. We're not even sure
there really was any onboard.

38
00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:11.905
The mayor is just glad that the
town has garnered a lot of attention.

39
00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:14.825
A ghost ship garnering attention?

40
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.525
Of course! And that's not all!

41
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:22.905
Inviting someone so famous
is another way of gaining prestige!

42
00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:28.155
My reputation extends this far?!

43
00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:29.525
But of course!

44
00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:34.325
All of Japan knows about the
great detective Kogoro Mori-san--

45
00:04:43.275 --> 00:04:45.175
Who's he?

46
00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.485
He works for a Tokyo travel agency.

47
00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:54.135
He wants to create a tour
centered around the ghost ship.

48
00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:01.105
Shikishima Island

49
00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:12.735
Welcome, Kogoro Mori-sensei!!
It's Detective Mori!

50
00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.965
It's really him!
Welcome, Kogoro Mori-sensei!!

51
00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:16.455
Welcome!
Welcome, Kogoro Mori-sensei!!

52
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.445
What a warm welcome!

53
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:28.075
Mori-sensei! Thank you
for coming all this way!

54
00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:30.945
I'm Mayor Mikami!

55
00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:32.715
We welcome you!

56
00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:34.325
Thanks!

57
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:37.155
Is this lame guy really famous?

58
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:42.145
I thought you
would've been a lot cooler.

59
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:43.735
What'd you say, kid?!

60
00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:46.825
Suzu-kun! Don't be rude
to Daddy's guest!

61
00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:50.405
What a lovely daughter you have!

62
00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:57.075
What?

63
00:05:57.075 --> 00:05:58.695
What's your name?!

64
00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:00.945
Conan. Conan Edogawa.

65
00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:04.715
That's a weird name.
Is that the trend in Tokyo?

66
00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:06.335
Leave me alone.

67
00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:08.275
Well, whatever.

68
00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:12.555
I'm Suzu Mikami! It looks like
I'm a little older than you!

69
00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:17.695
Being with younger people is trendy!

70
00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:19.185
Move!

71
00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:23.145
This is the travel agent--

72
00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:26.605
I'm Uehara from Toto Travel Agency.
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:32.195
Likewise! We'll help in
any way to bring tourists here!

74
00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:33.925
Where is the ghost ship?

75
00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:35.075
Huh?

76
00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:41.905
Here she is!

77
00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:44.455
I'll show you around!

78
00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:48.325
No thanks. I'll look for myself.

79
00:06:53.695 --> 00:06:55.925
This ship was on
the ocean floor for years

80
00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:59.385
but only has barnacles
on its underside.

81
00:06:59.775 --> 00:07:02.855
You dummy! It's a ghost ship!

82
00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:05.815
Talk about unscientific...

83
00:07:10.485 --> 00:07:13.115
Lighthouse Keeper -
Koji Hamada (42)

84
00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:15.825
Great Detective Kogoro Mori Lecture

85
00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:21.865
Here, Mori-sensei!
There's still time until the lecture!

86
00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:24.115
Thanks!

87
00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:28.715
Delicious!

88
00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:31.905
These cooked turban
shells are delicious!

89
00:07:31.905 --> 00:07:32.715
They sure are!

90
00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:38.425
Say, after the lecture,
I'd like to ask for your help...

91
00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:44.395
You want me to find
where the Ryujin-Maru sank?

92
00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:50.365
Such perceptiveness!
I think it sank near this island.

93
00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:54.365
If we just knew where,
we could locate the missing gold!

94
00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:59.485
But if it were recovered,
it wouldn't belong to you.

95
00:07:59.485 --> 00:08:02.075
The government
would come to collect it.

96
00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:06.695
But wouldn't we
be entitled to 10% of it?

97
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.165
Maybe, but...

98
00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:12.005
Please! Mori-sensei!

99
00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:17.965
Sorry! No famous detective
would ever go treasure hunting--

100
00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:21.425
How about 10% of
the island's reward money?

101
00:08:21.695 --> 00:08:23.365
You have a deal!

102
00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:24.975
Thank you!

103
00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:29.635
Kinoshita! Give him the details.

104
00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:30.645
Certainly.

105
00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:34.235
It happened on a stormy
night seven years ago.

106
00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:39.825
We received an SOS from the
Ryujin-Maru about 1 km offshore.

107
00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:43.615
However, the signal disappeared
as a rescue crew headed for it,

108
00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:48.825
and the next day, only the
owner's body washed ashore.

109
00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:54.175
No debris was ever found,
much less the gold.

110
00:08:54.485 --> 00:08:57.135
Whose gold was this?

111
00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:01.575
The ship's owner's. He was
going to be arrested for tax evasion

112
00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:04.445
so he converted his entire
fortune into gold and was on his way

113
00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.435
out of the country.

114
00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:09.115
I see.

115
00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:14.235
Very well! I, Kogoro Mori,
shall locate the gold for you!

116
00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:16.445
Thank you very much!

117
00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:23.945
I don't know about this lecture thing.

118
00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:25.985
Isn't he just gonna
humiliate himself?

119
00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:32.455
Suigun Artifact Museum

120
00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:45.695
The general's armor...

121
00:09:47.445 --> 00:09:48.605
Interesting?

122
00:09:48.945 --> 00:09:51.825
Yeah! There's so much rare stuff!

123
00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:54.865
Yes, it's this island's cultural heritage.

124
00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:59.275
Four-hundred years ago, the Suigun
escaped here after being defeated

125
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:01.985
in a large battle.

126
00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:07.455
But the islanders wanted the
reward money for their heads

127
00:10:07.455 --> 00:10:10.615
and attacked the wounded Suigun.

128
00:10:10.615 --> 00:10:17.425
They eventually drove them into
a remote cave and killed them all.

129
00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:22.115
Various bad things
have occurred ever since.

130
00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:23.405
Like a curse?

131
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:28.645
Yes. So a shrine was built in the
cave to quiet the Suigun's spirits.

132
00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:31.105
But aren't curses just superstitions?

133
00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:34.355
No, that's not the case.

134
00:10:35.195 --> 00:10:41.405
Many people who live near the
cave have seen armor-clad ghosts,

135
00:10:41.405 --> 00:10:47.235
and eerie groans can be heard
coming from the cave's depths.

136
00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:52.575
I think it was about five years ago

137
00:10:52.575 --> 00:10:57.045
when a university professor
studying the Suigun visited.

138
00:10:57.405 --> 00:11:02.755
He ignored the islanders'
warnings and went to examine the cave.

139
00:11:02.755 --> 00:11:05.875
But two or three nights later...

140
00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:20.315
And that professor?!

141
00:11:20.905 --> 00:11:27.825
Yes. It was never confirmed,
but he was never seen again.

142
00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:31.995
Nobody dares go near
that cave anymore.

143
00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:35.455
Believing that in this day and
age is why you get laughed at!

144
00:11:35.455 --> 00:11:36.615
Young lady!

145
00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:40.405
Daddy said the professor
checked the cave but probably left

146
00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:44.365
'cause he didn't find anything.

147
00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:50.405
Let's go, Conan-kun!
I'll show you a great place!

148
00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.725
Wait!

149
00:11:53.985 --> 00:11:55.475
Where are we going?

150
00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:59.835
We can sneak backstage from here!
Best seats in the house!

151
00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:05.965
What's with him?!

152
00:12:05.965 --> 00:12:07.115
Who is that?

153
00:12:07.445 --> 00:12:11.285
Hamada, the lighthouse keeper.
He's really weird!

154
00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:12.785
Weird?

155
00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:19.705
He hardly hangs out with anyone,
and he always goes to that cave.

156
00:12:24.615 --> 00:12:26.885
Long time, no see, Aoki.

157
00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:31.845
Don't pretend you don't recognize me.

158
00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:36.235
What are you talking about?
I'm Hamada, the lighthouse keeper!

159
00:12:36.235 --> 00:12:37.015
Why, you!

160
00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:43.275
You have the wrong person! Let go!

161
00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:49.535
I'll tear that face of yours off, Aoki!

162
00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:57.455
Now then, here is the peerless
Detective Kogoro Mori-sensei!

163
00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:02.965
You're too kind!

164
00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:05.425
Will he be all
right drunk like that?

165
00:13:08.275 --> 00:13:09.885
How lame...
How lame...

166
00:13:10.275 --> 00:13:13.265
He appears to be rather nervous!

167
00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:23.365
Let's have him break the
celebration ball in honor of his visit!

168
00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:25.155
Whenever you're ready!

169
00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:33.905
Huh?

170
00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:38.325
What's that smell?

171
00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:46.125
It's gasoline!

172
00:13:48.085 --> 00:13:48.965
Old man!

173
00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:56.009
Old man!

174
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:04.629
What on earth?!

175
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:05.419
Hot!
What on earth?!

176
00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:06.509
Dad!

177
00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:11.799
Hot! Hot!

178
00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:21.219
It's the curse!
The Suigun curse!

179
00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:24.729
Wait!

180
00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:34.659
Ah. That string was modified
to ignite the gasoline inside.

181
00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:37.799
The target being... the old man.

182
00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:41.079
In which case,
the ones most suspect are...

183
00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:44.079
...Hamada-san,
who left out the back door,

184
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.839
and the man he got in
an argument with, Uehara-san.

185
00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:51.969
Could it have something
to do with the ghost ship?!

186
00:14:57.009 --> 00:14:59.469
Mayor! What's the meaning of this!

187
00:14:59.969 --> 00:15:02.929
I only survived because
I'm so well-trained!

188
00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:08.899
My deepest apologies for getting
you involved in such an accident!

189
00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:12.739
Accident?!
Someone clearly planned that!

190
00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:16.719
No, sparks from a short
circuit just happened to ignite

191
00:15:16.719 --> 00:15:18.449
a nearby gas container--

192
00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:19.199
But...
a nearby gas container--

193
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:21.909
Listen to me. It was an accident.

194
00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:26.879
You sure you just don't
want a police incident?

195
00:15:28.589 --> 00:15:31.839
Weren't gonna turn the gold
over if you found it, were you?

196
00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:36.669
But you'd have no choice
if the mainland police showed up.

197
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:40.809
Mori-san! You just need to
keep quiet and find the gold!

198
00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:42.219
What was that?!

199
00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:48.189
Defy me and there's no guarantee
you'll leave the island unharmed.

200
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:51.259
You can't threaten me!

201
00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:55.009
You can't take the ferry
without my authorization.

202
00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:59.629
Well, take your time
to think it over tonight.

203
00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:02.419
Damn him!

204
00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:05.079
Looks like we came
to a pretty bad island...

205
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.759
Kinoshita-san...

206
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.759
I apologize. The mayor seems
to only care about finding the gold

207
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:14.799
and turning the island
into a tourist attraction.

208
00:16:15.219 --> 00:16:17.169
He's a selfish bastard!

209
00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:19.219
But don't worry.

210
00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:23.089
I'll take you back
to the mainland anyway.

211
00:16:23.089 --> 00:16:26.169
Luckily, I can prepare
a small fishing boat.

212
00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:27.489
That's great!

213
00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.229
No! I refuse to go!

214
00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:30.189
Dad?!

215
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.759
Inadvisable!

216
00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:34.149
You may be harmed if you stay!

217
00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:39.869
No self-respecting detective
would dare run away now!

218
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:42.079
Well said, old man!

219
00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:48.719
Kinoshita-san!

220
00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:51.419
What is Hamada-san like?

221
00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:53.319
You mean the lighthouse keeper?

222
00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:54.249
Yeah.

223
00:16:54.249 --> 00:16:58.839
I don't know; he's not from here.

224
00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:02.759
He came here a while after
the Ryujin-Maru incident

225
00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:06.009
and said he was looking for work.

226
00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:10.189
There was no one working the
lighthouse, so he took that job.

227
00:17:11.879 --> 00:17:13.969
Did Hamada do something?

228
00:17:13.969 --> 00:17:17.089
No! I just thought he seemed strange!

229
00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.489
See you later!

230
00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:27.789
Oh, Yoko-chan...

231
00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:41.579
Is that Hamada-i?

232
00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:44.599
It's me!

233
00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:46.199
Don't scare me!

234
00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:52.189
How rude! You should thank
me for following you late at night!

235
00:17:55.469 --> 00:17:56.589
Wait!

236
00:18:00.589 --> 00:18:04.169
Wait, we're not that
close of friends yet--

237
00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:10.049
Uehara-san?

238
00:18:10.049 --> 00:18:12.369
So he was that person up there?

239
00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:19.379
What the...

240
00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:25.519
That person was searching the place?

241
00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:28.269
That smell!

242
00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:32.589
It's gasoline. Yet there are
no cars or motorcycles here.

243
00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:34.189
It's light.

244
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:37.899
So it was Hamada-san
who tried to kill him!

245
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:40.819
Conan! Don't run off!

246
00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:48.089
What was he doing up here?!

247
00:18:51.449 --> 00:18:52.709
A telescope?

248
00:18:56.589 --> 00:18:59.199
Forget it. There's nothing to see.

249
00:18:59.749 --> 00:19:03.469
It's pointed at the mountains.
They'd be boring to look at.

250
00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:07.389
That's strange. A lighthouse
telescope should be pointing out to sea.

251
00:19:08.089 --> 00:19:11.259
But this one is fixed
toward the mountains!

252
00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.899
What is it?

253
00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:16.609
'Ryujin-Maru'?

254
00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:20.629
No question about it! Hamada-san
is connected to the Ryujin-Maru!

255
00:19:20.629 --> 00:19:23.839
And there's something
he doesn't want investigated,

256
00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:25.719
so he tried to kill the old man...

257
00:19:25.719 --> 00:19:27.869
Oh no! The old man and Ran!

258
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:32.539
Hold on!

259
00:19:43.469 --> 00:19:45.219
Morning already?

260
00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:53.559
Who are you?!

261
00:19:54.129 --> 00:19:55.519
What's going on--

262
00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:57.729
Ran! Stay away!

263
00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:01.379
Get back here, you!

264
00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:03.149
Dad!

265
00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:05.359
Conan-kun?!

266
00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:11.119
Get back here!

267
00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:18.579
It's hard to run
with my sore butt!

268
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:34.379
I got you now!

269
00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:49.719
Where did you go?! I was so worried!

270
00:20:49.719 --> 00:20:50.779
Did something happen?!

271
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:54.239
Dad was attacked by a Suigun!

272
00:20:54.239 --> 00:20:55.429
What?!

273
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:00.119
What's that?!

274
00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.719
The alarm bell by the port!

275
00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:03.629
They ring it whenever
something happens!

276
00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.839
Don't tell me--

277
00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:06.129
Conan-kun!

278
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:07.669
Come on, already!

279
00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:12.139
Hey! Did something happen?!

280
00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:15.589
Help!

281
00:21:16.629 --> 00:21:17.159
This is some sort of mistake!

282
00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:18.229
The old man?!
This is some sort of mistake!

283
00:21:18.469 --> 00:21:19.919
Dad!

284
00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:21.519
What on earth is going on?!

285
00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:25.419
That detective killed Hamada,
the lighthouse keeper!

286
00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:25.939
What?!

287
00:21:27.009 --> 00:21:28.239
Dad did?!

288
00:21:28.239 --> 00:21:30.779
Check for yourself
if you think we're lying!

289
00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:47.629
When we arrived on the scene,
the detective was unconscious

290
00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:49.009
and the victim was dead!

291
00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:52.089
Believe me! I didn't do it!

292
00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:53.419
You'll pay!

293
00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:56.969
The ghosts got mad because
an outsider was poking around!

294
00:21:57.719 --> 00:22:00.799
He would never
do something like this!

295
00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:03.919
But given the situation!

296
00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:49.749
Kinoshita-san!

297
00:23:57.509 --> 00:23:59.259
The ghosts are mad!

298
00:23:59.879 --> 00:24:00.899
A suicide?!

299
00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:07.019
No, this was no suicide!
In which case, the killer is--

300
00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:09.259
On the next Conan--

301
00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:12.379
The Ghost Ship Murder Case (Part 2).

302
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.742
Next Conan's Hint:

303
00:24:15.742 --> 00:24:15.750
Next Conan's Hint:
Gunshot Wound.

304
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.019
Gunshot Wound.
