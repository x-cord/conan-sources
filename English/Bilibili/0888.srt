1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.340
Inside "Mokujin", a trick box made by Kichiemon Samizu,

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.240
is the big jewel and Thief Kid's target "Luna Memoria".

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.540
And the instructions to open the box

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.740
can be found in one of ten thousand books

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.640
donated to the Suzuki Library.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.840
It's worth finding, don't you think?

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.840
This is way too many.

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.340
Is it possible your husband hid the page somewhere else?

9
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.140
No.

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.940
My husband died last month

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.340
in an unfortunate traffic accident.

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
He couldn't have foreseen that and hidden the page elsewhere.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.340
Then maybe it's in a book you wouldn't normally read.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.340
You're right.

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240
I tend not to read

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.440
murder mysteries or monster stories.

17
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.440
Huh? Sonoko, did you put on some makeup?

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.940
While we were in the bathroom.

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.240
After all, Thief Kid is coming.

20
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.540
I need to dress up for him.

21
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.540
Even if he does come,

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.940
the anti-theft mechanisms and trick box

23
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.340
will probably prevent him from taking the moonstone.

24
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.140
Not even that pretentious thief could manage that.

25
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240
I wouldn't be so sure.

26
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.440
This presence...

27
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.640
It's him.

28
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.340
He's nearby.

29
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.040
Who?

30
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.640
Who is he disguised as?

31
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.640
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

32
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.640
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

33
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.640
I'll see through the disguise of the thief

34
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.840
coming after the trick box full of memories!

35
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.040
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.339
"Thief Kid and the Trick Box (Part 2)"

39
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.339
"Suzuki Library"

40
00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.339
Pops hasn't been coughing

41
00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.239
since he came back from the bathroom.

42
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.139
Akai seems more interested in his surroundings than his book.

43
00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.839
Dr. Agasa spent too long in the bathroom.

44
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.039
The only ones who aren't suspicious

45
00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.939
are Jirokichi and the old woman.

46
00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:29.839
With the remote for the security devices,

47
00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.139
he'd have plenty of opportunities to swap out the box.

48
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.139
And Thief Kid wouldn't get so upset over the box getting wet.

49
00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.739
What about Ran and Sonoko?

50
00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.039
Thief Kid's disguised himself as them before, hasn't he?

51
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.839
What's wrong?

52
00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.839
There's a book up there that I'm interested in,

53
00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.739
but I can't reach it.

54
00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.539
I could probably get it if I used a ladder,

55
00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.339
but they're both being used.

56
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:08.139
I'll hold your chair for you.

57
00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.539
Thank you.

58
00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.139
I'll use their heights to identify them.

59
00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.139
Since they're both about as tall as the Dr. Agasa...

60
00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.039
I can almost see her underwear.

61
00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.339
No, wait.

62
00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.339
It could be Thief Kid disguised as her.

63
00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.339
But these thighs are definitely...

64
00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.439
What a nice view.

65
00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.839
No...

66
00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.039
You may look like a child,

67
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.739
but you're a dirty old man on the inside.

68
00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:49.239
Pervert.

69
00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:50.639
It's no use. I can't reach it.

70
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.939
I was just observing her

71
00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.139
to see if it was Thief Kid in disguise.

72
00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.539
So you're a huge pervert.

73
00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.739
Yeah, sorry! I'm such a pervert!

74
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.439
Anyway, can't you sense his presence, too?

75
00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.839
Who knows? I don't feel anything.

76
00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.339
Aside from him, couldn't he be anybody?

77
00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.339
He's the only one who's been in this room the whole time.

78
00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:17.739
No.

79
00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:20.839
It's possible he's been disguised as Subaru Okiya all along

80
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.639
and snuck in that way.

81
00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.439
Darn it.

82
00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.039
Everyone's starting to look suspicious.

83
00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.139
Here. Isn't this the book you wanted?

84
00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.639
Thanks!

85
00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.439
What's this?

86
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.939
"13 Conditions For Dating a Detective"?

87
00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.039
Don't look!

88
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.339
I'm not sure if it will help,

89
00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:53.839
but embarrassingly enough,

90
00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.639
my husband and I kept an exchange diary when we were students.

91
00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.839
"Exchange Diary" -It was a very strange diary.

92
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.739
Strange how?

93
00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:06.839
We agreed that my husband would write on the left,

94
00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:11.139
and I would write on the right.

95
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.439
But I couldn't fit all the day's events

96
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.239
or how I felt about my husband on a single page.

97
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.739
So I'd fill three whole pages

98
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:26.639
so my husband could write on the left.

99
00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.639
But my husband only ever wrote a few sentences.

100
00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.339
Maybe he just wasn't much of a writer.

101
00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:38.739
Yes. That's what I though at the time.

102
00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:42.039
But just after we got married,

103
00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:47.139
I found the exchange diary on my husband's desk.

104
00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:52.339
As I was reading the awkward writing of my younger self

105
00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.839
with feelings of embarrassment and nostalgia,

106
00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.639
I suddenly came across two full pages

107
00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:02.639
of my husband's writing

108
00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:07.639
that I didn't recognize

109
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:11.339
from our days as students.

110
00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:17.939
My husband took it from me immediately after that.

111
00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:25.539
You can't read that. It's secret.

112
00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.639
I haven't seen the exchange diary since.

113
00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:34.539
I wonder what that was.

114
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.839
Perhaps it's related to the piece of paper we can't find.

115
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.339
Maybe the pages were glued together.

116
00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:45.439
Your husband may have been eating rice balls while reading that page.

117
00:08:45.439 --> 00:08:48.739
A grain of rice could've fallen between the pages.

118
00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:55.039
My husband was a very shy man.

119
00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:59.839
I had his mother teach me.

120
00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.539
If any water got inside...

121
00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:07.739
It was a very strange diary.

122
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.539
If you're able to find that paper,

123
00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:15.139
you should be able to find the true contents of the box.

124
00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:24.239
That face.

125
00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:29.339
Looks like you've figured it out, too, Detective.

126
00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:31.939
Both where that paper is

127
00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:34.639
and the true contents of the box.

128
00:09:45.405 --> 00:09:46.505
What?

129
00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:48.705
You figured out where the written instructions

130
00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:51.005
to open the box are?

131
00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:52.105
Yeah.

132
00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:58.305
And why we haven't been able to find it.

133
00:09:58.305 --> 00:10:00.405
Conan, what do you mean?

134
00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:04.105
You're not just making things up, are you?

135
00:10:04.105 --> 00:10:07.005
Could I borrow a notebook and pen?

136
00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:11.005
Will these work?

137
00:10:11.005 --> 00:10:12.405
Thanks.

138
00:10:12.405 --> 00:10:16.005
First, we'll tear out a single page.

139
00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:21.305
And tear that page in half again.

140
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:26.305
On the front and back of the torn page,

141
00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:28.305
we'll draw a circle.

142
00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:33.205
There. Now, study it carefully and remember what it looks like.

143
00:10:33.205 --> 00:10:34.905
Okay.

144
00:10:36.905 --> 00:10:38.905
It's just a circle, right?

145
00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:40.105
Once you've memorized it,

146
00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:43.005
can you put it back inside the notebook?

147
00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:44.605
Here.

148
00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:45.805
Thanks.

149
00:10:47.705 --> 00:10:49.505
Abracadabra.

150
00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:52.005
I command this paper to disappear!

151
00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:54.505
Here.

152
00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:56.505
Now you can't find it.

153
00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:59.205
Don't be ridiculous!

154
00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.705
By flipping through it, it should instantly...

155
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.305
What?

156
00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:06.105
This can't be possible.

157
00:11:06.105 --> 00:11:07.805
It must be in here somewhere.

158
00:11:08.805 --> 00:11:11.505
-What? -It disappeared?

159
00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.405
Wow!

160
00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:17.305
You didn't secretly take it out, did you?

161
00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:19.605
I wouldn't do that.

162
00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:21.205
After all...

163
00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:25.705
See? It's still in here.

164
00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:28.705
No way!

165
00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:30.405
How?

166
00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:33.705
The trick is in the edge of the page.

167
00:11:33.705 --> 00:11:36.505
See how the bottom edge of the page

168
00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:38.305
is slightly torn where the paper is?

169
00:11:41.305 --> 00:11:42.905
Let me see that.

170
00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:45.705
That makes it so it doesn't get caught on your finger

171
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:49.505
when you flip through it so you skip over that page.

172
00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:51.305
You're right.

173
00:11:51.305 --> 00:11:54.205
If you flip through the pages while holding them from the top,

174
00:11:54.205 --> 00:11:56.805
you'll find the paper.

175
00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:58.005
You're right.

176
00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:00.205
It's like a magic trick.

177
00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:02.605
I tore the edge of the page

178
00:12:02.605 --> 00:12:05.705
while you were all looking at the paper.

179
00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:08.105
The old woman's husband probably used

180
00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:12.005
the same trick in the exchange diary she mentioned.

181
00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:15.405
Her husband was a shy man,

182
00:12:15.405 --> 00:12:17.305
so he made it

183
00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:21.505
so the pages he wrote on would be skipped over.

184
00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:23.905
The old woman was able to find them

185
00:12:23.905 --> 00:12:26.305
because she was carefully turning each page

186
00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:29.005
while reading the sections she wrote.

187
00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:31.505
But, boy,

188
00:12:31.505 --> 00:12:36.905
unless we know which of these ten thousand books uses the same trick...

189
00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:39.305
-I figured that out, too. -What?

190
00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:42.005
Even if you make the instructions hard to find,

191
00:12:42.005 --> 00:12:43.905
you'd eventually find them

192
00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:47.105
if you turned each page like the old woman did.

193
00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:48.305
Yes.

194
00:12:48.305 --> 00:12:53.405
But your husband said you'd never find them, right?

195
00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:54.805
What? Yes.

196
00:12:54.805 --> 00:13:00.105
So it's between some pages you'd never turn.

197
00:13:00.105 --> 00:13:05.205
But Subaru and Ai examined the mystery novels

198
00:13:05.205 --> 00:13:08.705
and monster stories the old woman didn't like, right?

199
00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:12.505
The old woman already searched those.

200
00:13:12.505 --> 00:13:15.905
She doesn't have to read them to look for the paper.

201
00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:17.705
Then which book is it?

202
00:13:17.705 --> 00:13:20.405
Quit putting on airs and tell us!

203
00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:24.705
It's a book with pages she'd never need to turn.

204
00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:28.205
There was no point in her reading them

205
00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:30.205
because she'd learned something even better

206
00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:33.805
than what was written on those pages.

207
00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.405
It's the...

208
00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:39.305
meat and potatoes recipe in a cookbook, isn't it?

209
00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:41.205
Correct!

210
00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:42.605
I see.

211
00:13:42.605 --> 00:13:45.705
She learned the recipe from her mother-in-law.

212
00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:49.705
Since her husband loved those flavors,

213
00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:52.305
there was no need for her to read it.

214
00:13:52.305 --> 00:13:54.605
And if it were between the pages of any other recipe,

215
00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:57.805
even if he used the trick you described earlier,

216
00:13:57.805 --> 00:14:02.505
she would've found it by searching the pages written in the index.

217
00:14:04.305 --> 00:14:05.705
Where are the cookbooks?

218
00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:10.605
I believe they're over on that shelf.

219
00:14:10.605 --> 00:14:13.705
But there are dozens of cookbooks.

220
00:14:15.005 --> 00:14:17.905
A few dozen out of ten thousand.

221
00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:21.205
And we're only searching the meat and potato recipes.

222
00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:23.905
If we all search for it, it should take only a few minutes.

223
00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:28.305
What?

224
00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:30.205
A blackout?

225
00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:33.105
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid is here!

226
00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:39.305
The lights went out.

227
00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:41.305
Inspector, should we go in?

228
00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:42.805
Don't panic!

229
00:14:42.805 --> 00:14:46.405
We agreed not to enter this time until we've received the signal.

230
00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:49.205
So keep all the exits covered instead.

231
00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:51.305
Don't let a single ant out!

232
00:14:51.305 --> 00:14:52.305
Yes, sir...

233
00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:56.405
Gosh. You let Thief Kid mess with the wiring

234
00:14:56.405 --> 00:14:59.005
because you wouldn't let the cops in.

235
00:14:59.005 --> 00:15:01.805
Don't worry.

236
00:15:01.805 --> 00:15:03.605
Even if he does come,

237
00:15:03.605 --> 00:15:08.105
he won't be able to open the trick box in the darkness.

238
00:15:09.705 --> 00:15:11.605
A music box.

239
00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:15.405
Isn't this "My Grandfather's Clock"?

240
00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:18.805
Didn't she say the box plays music when it's opened?

241
00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:24.805
That was the sound of the cage falling!

242
00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:26.205
What are you doing?

243
00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:29.005
Get those lights back on!

244
00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:30.405
Hey, what's going on?

245
00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:34.705
Is the trick box safe?

246
00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:37.505
He didn't take it.

247
00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:38.805
What?

248
00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:42.505
"I've taken the contents of the box. Thief Kid"

249
00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:45.305
"I've taken the contents of the box."

250
00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:46.705
"Thief Kid."

251
00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:48.805
That's impossible!

252
00:15:48.805 --> 00:15:52.505
Are you saying he opened Kichiemon Samizu's trick box

253
00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:57.105
in the darkness in such a short amount of time?

254
00:15:57.105 --> 00:15:59.105
I knew he could do it!

255
00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:01.105
He got us this time.

256
00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:04.805
Looks like we're not needed anymore.

257
00:16:04.805 --> 00:16:07.005
Can we leave now?

258
00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:09.005
-No! -What?

259
00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:13.005
The security shutters linked to the cage are closed.

260
00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:15.505
He should still be inside.

261
00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:21.005
I'll find him, even if it means pulling the faces of everyone in here.

262
00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:23.705
Please don't.

263
00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:25.805
Remember what I said?

264
00:16:25.805 --> 00:16:29.205
I'd allow you to display the trick box here on the condition

265
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:31.905
that you not to do anything boorish

266
00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:35.005
to the guests at the library.

267
00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.905
But, madam,

268
00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:40.905
the moonstone your husband left you...

269
00:16:40.905 --> 00:16:43.305
He can have the moonstone

270
00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:48.105
for opening the box.

271
00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:49.105
"Japanese Cooking"

272
00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:53.605
What I really wanted

273
00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:57.505
was the other thing inside the box.

274
00:16:57.505 --> 00:17:00.705
While searching the books according to what that boy said,

275
00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:04.405
I found the piece of paper in this cookbook.

276
00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:07.305
Let us open the box and see what's inside.

277
00:17:11.705 --> 00:17:16.905
But he may have taken the other object.

278
00:17:17.605 --> 00:17:19.405
Don't worry.

279
00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.305
I'm the only one left in this world

280
00:17:22.305 --> 00:17:25.405
who sees any value in it.

281
00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:31.805
It hurts...

282
00:17:31.805 --> 00:17:33.405
What's wrong, Dr. Agasa?

283
00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:35.605
It's my stomach again.

284
00:17:35.605 --> 00:17:39.505
Then go to the bathroom.

285
00:17:39.505 --> 00:17:40.905
I will.

286
00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:48.705
Hey.

287
00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:52.705
You still haven't opened the box, have you?

288
00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:57.005
What? Conan, I'm using the toilet.

289
00:17:57.005 --> 00:17:58.705
Using the toilet?

290
00:17:58.705 --> 00:18:00.805
You haven't taken off your pants.

291
00:18:02.105 --> 00:18:05.705
Well, I was just about to do my business.

292
00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:08.805
Anyway, Dr. Agasa doesn't call me "Conan"

293
00:18:08.805 --> 00:18:11.605
when we're alone together.

294
00:18:11.605 --> 00:18:13.305
Oh, no!

295
00:18:13.305 --> 00:18:14.905
Those band-aids on your right hand...

296
00:18:16.205 --> 00:18:20.705
Dr. Agasa had one on the second joint of his pointer finger,

297
00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.405
not the tip.

298
00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:28.505
Besides, Dr. Agasa is as tall as Ran.

299
00:18:28.505 --> 00:18:34.105
How did you easily pick out the book that Ran couldn't reach

300
00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:37.605
while standing on her tip toes on top of a chair?

301
00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:41.705
Probably because you were using the thickness of Dr. Agasa's legs

302
00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:45.205
to bend your knees and make yourself look shorter,

303
00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:48.605
but straightened them to get the book.

304
00:18:49.805 --> 00:18:51.705
Right?

305
00:18:54.105 --> 00:18:56.305
Thief Kid.

306
00:18:56.305 --> 00:19:01.105
How did you know I hadn't opened the box yet?

307
00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:02.905
The American Henry Work wrote

308
00:19:02.905 --> 00:19:08.205
"My Grandfather's Clock" in 1876.

309
00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:12.105
But it didn't get to Japan until 1940.

310
00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:15.405
A mid-19th Century tinkerer wouldn't have known the song.

311
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:18.505
You played it on your phone, didn't you?

312
00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:21.205
Correct!

313
00:19:22.405 --> 00:19:26.705
Are you sure you don't need to check out that moonstone?

314
00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:30.205
I thought you were looking for a special jewel.

315
00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:35.305
Actually, I once stole that moonstone back

316
00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:40.405
after a thief stole it from that woman's husband.

317
00:19:43.705 --> 00:19:45.205
Watch where you're going!

318
00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:51.505
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:55.105
Isn't this yours?

320
00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:58.005
Yes, but why?

321
00:19:58.005 --> 00:20:00.705
Be careful. You were just pickpocketed.

322
00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:06.705
This moonstone looks expensive.

323
00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:09.205
Is it a gift?

324
00:20:09.205 --> 00:20:12.305
Yes, for my wife.

325
00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:14.105
You could say it's her reward.

326
00:20:16.005 --> 00:20:20.005
I want to keep it next to our diary.

327
00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:24.605
After all, moonstones are a symbol of pure love.

328
00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:26.805
"Congratulations! You finally found it!"

329
00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:38.905
So, it's just the exchange diary.

330
00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.705
I see.

331
00:20:41.705 --> 00:20:44.005
So you've already checked it out.

332
00:20:44.005 --> 00:20:48.705
I only came here to accept his challenge.

333
00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:52.205
I'll be leaving now.

334
00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:55.105
It's strange. It won't open.

335
00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:57.705
Before you leave,

336
00:20:57.705 --> 00:21:00.605
I'd like you to return those photos you took of me.

337
00:21:00.605 --> 00:21:02.905
I can't let those get out.

338
00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:08.905
Come to think of it, he had some kind of device on his neck.

339
00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:12.905
Another blackout?

340
00:21:15.105 --> 00:21:18.605
Darn it. He left his phone and ran.

341
00:22:42.905 --> 00:22:45.405
"Mouri Detective Agency"

342
00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:47.505
"General Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki (72)"

343
00:22:47.505 --> 00:22:49.605
"Yoko Okino Live Project, 'Hashage Live'"

344
00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:02.705
Thanks for the food...

345
00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:09.905
-It's good! -It's good!

346
00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:14.905
This is...

347
00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:16.405
pretty good.

348
00:23:18.205 --> 00:23:21.605
The Suzuki Library is still closed

349
00:23:21.605 --> 00:23:26.205
as the search for Thief Kid enters its twelfth hour.

350
00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:28.805
As opening time nears,

351
00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:32.605
the search team appears increasingly exhausted.

352
00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:36.205
They're hoping to arrest Thief Kid as soon as possible.

353
00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:39.905
Inspector Nakamori.

354
00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:42.105
There's nowhere else left to search.

355
00:23:42.105 --> 00:23:44.805
Perhaps he's already escaped.

356
00:23:44.805 --> 00:23:46.505
That's impossible.

357
00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:48.005
Find him!

358
00:23:48.005 --> 00:23:50.905
Just give up already.

359
00:23:53.905 --> 00:23:55.505
"Next Episode" -This is Ms. Wakasa.

360
00:23:55.505 --> 00:23:58.805
She'll be my assistant homeroom teacher starting today.

361
00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:00.705
Nice...

362
00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:02.505
Nice to meet you!

363
00:24:02.505 --> 00:24:06.305
