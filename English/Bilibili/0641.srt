1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,940
We visited Okayama.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,140
We encounter a woman there who has amnesia

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,340
and end up helping to find out her identity.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,240
The clues that we have to go on,

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
are the 8 sketches that she drew.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,940
After we started investigating,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,340
we ran into a friend of hers,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,940
Ms. Kanae Nonomiya, who had also been looking for her.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,340
"Kanae Nonomiya (25)" -According to Kanae,

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
we find out that the woman's name is Mayuko Kichise.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,340
We also found that Mayuko was an eye-witness who could prove

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,540
that Kanae's older brother who was arrested as a suspect

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,340
"Keigo Nonomiya (28)" -of a robbery case was innocent.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,440
Unless Mayuko regains her memory,

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,340
it's impossible to prove that he was just a scapegoat.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,740
While investigating

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,940
we find that Mayuko's room has been ransacked,

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,040
or that there's suspicious figure following us around.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,640
We couldn't help but smell smoke.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,740
Amidst all this, Mayuko's whereabouts become unknown.

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,840
No good. Mayuko's life is in danger.

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,940
Like the fog clears.

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,440
Let's see through love and crime as well.

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,240
Lost memory returns.

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,440
At the end of the trip through Okayama and Kurashiki.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:48,823
"Memory Trip of the Eight Sketches (Kurashiki Part)"

30
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:57,723
No!

31
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:01,323
Help, somebody!

32
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,023
Go get him!

33
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:17,223
Ms. Mayuko.

34
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:19,423
Ms. Mayuko, are you all right?

35
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:20,923
Ms. Mayuko.

36
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,923
It's dangerous, we should call the police

37
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:27,923
and have you taken into custody after all.

38
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,923
But, I can't possibly trust the police

39
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,423
who have the nerve to arrest

40
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:34,423
my older brother who is innocent.

41
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,623
Yes, so... please let us continue as is.

42
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,523
Thank you, Mayuko.

43
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,923
I'm sure that brother would...

44
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,323
I'm not doing this only for your older brother.

45
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:49,323
I feel so wretched.

46
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,323
While I was crying myself out,

47
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:54,723
not being able to remember the past, all the pain,

48
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,123
I felt so lost, then suddenly the past overwhelmed me.

49
00:03:57,123 --> 00:04:00,723
I felt sort of vexed.

50
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,723
I'm going to get my memory back no matter what it takes.

51
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,723
I understand.

52
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:09,923
I admire Mayuko.

53
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:13,623
I'll bet she's actually a very strong person.

54
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,723
You've come to visit a friend here?

55
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,523
Another coincidence.

56
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,123
We really synch, don't we?

57
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:26,823
"Kenzo Taira (40)" -It really surprised me that she had amnesia.

58
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:29,623
If there's anything I can do, please let me know anytime.

59
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:31,323
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:35,223
I'll be going then.

61
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:36,323
See you.

62
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:40,623
Is something the matter?

63
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:44,223
That man looks familiar.

64
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:45,223
Really?

65
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:47,623
Of course.

66
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,223
To all local sweet fans here

67
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,423
he's considered their God.

68
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,523
Our company did a special on him too.

69
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:56,823
"Charisma Pastry Chef, Kenzo Taira" -See.

70
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,123
Is he Mr. Taira?

71
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:01,923
"Teruyuki Nashita (35)" -Yes, he looked so different

72
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,223
that I was surprised, though.

73
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:08,623
We only have 5 more sketches to go.

74
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,723
I wonder what place this indicates?

75
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:15,723
I have no idea...

76
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,723
I just realized,

77
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:23,323
but could this be referring to the sounding boiling pot reading?

78
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,223
Sounding boiling pot?

79
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:28,523
The sounding boiling pot reading

80
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,123
is a ritual in this Kibitsu Shrine

81
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,423
that has been passed down from ancient times.

82
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,723
By drawing upon the length

83
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:36,123
and loudness of the rice that is boiling in the pot,

84
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,623
good or bad fortune is predicted.

85
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:47,023
Ms. Mayuko, could it be...

86
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:49,023
You regained your memory?

87
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:50,723
Quiet.

88
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,723
You're the one who...

89
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:56,423
Do you know her?

90
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,623
I don't know why I cried.

91
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:04,223
Maybe she had a sounding boiling pot reading done before?

92
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,623
Yes, three days ago.

93
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:09,423
That's a day before the robbery.

94
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,423
Didn't she mention anything?

95
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,123
Well...

96
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:18,423
I want to start over from scratch by getting rid of my past.

97
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,123
I want to really stand on my own two feet this time.

98
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:24,023
It seems you went on an introspective walk here

99
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:25,923
and there around Okayama,

100
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,923
the place where you were born and raised.

101
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:32,523
I see. Now I understand why she visited the places that she sketched.

102
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:35,323
We received more postings on our website again.

103
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,723
She was witnessed in Kurashiki too.

104
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:43,123
We immediately moved on to Kurashiki.

105
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:46,123
"Kurashiki Grillwork"

106
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,523
This drawing...

107
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,223
Isn't this the grillwork of that window?

108
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:55,123
I see, it was a drawing of Kurashiki grillwork.

109
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,123
Kurashiki grillwork?

110
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:59,423
It's a design exclusive of Kurashiki.

111
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:02,223
You can see a lot of it if we go to the Bikan Historical District.

112
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:03,923
Bikan Historical District?

113
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,523
"Bikan District"

114
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:14,123
There seems to be no mistake that Mayuko came here.

115
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,423
What's the matter?

116
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:30,023
He just asked me for directions.

117
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:35,023
Sonny, you try it.

118
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:36,023
What?

119
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:44,123
"Handmade Sparrow-shaped Pancake Workshop"

120
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,723
Why me?

121
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:51,723
Conan, look this way.

122
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,223
Afterwards, we found places that matched the sketches

123
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,823
that were drawn one after the other.

124
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:01,223
"Kuraho Memorial Hall"

125
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:10,423
Ms. Mayuko's memory was coming back little by little.

126
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:18,223
I've been here before.

127
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:19,723
"Ohara Art Museum"

128
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,723
Yes, here too.

129
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:24,523
"Yurinso Villa"

130
00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:26,323
I remember.

131
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:30,223
And there were only two more sketches to go.

132
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:33,523
That's maybe...

133
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,423
"Peach Boy Museum of Illusion"

134
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:38,423
"Peach Boy Museum of Illusion" -I think it's here?

135
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:43,523
When you turn the disc,

136
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,823
the number of ogres differ?

137
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,323
What?

138
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,523
The grapes are gone

139
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,723
and there are two bunches bananas instead.

140
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,223
It's because the picture of grapes are painted

141
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:01,923
on the face-up surface of this accordion shaped object,

142
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:05,123
but on the surface facing downward, bananas are painted instead.

143
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,123
I see. On the mirror that is placed below,

144
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:11,323
the bananas that are drawn on the bottom are reflected.

145
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:12,423
Isn't it interesting to think that

146
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:15,423
just by changing the angle a different thing can be seen.

147
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:19,323
By changing the angle, a different thing can be seen?

148
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:25,523
"No matter how long I wait"

149
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,923
"He never shows up"

150
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:32,423
What a beautiful moon.

151
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,423
There's no moon anywhere.

152
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,523
I won't let you get away... What?

153
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:45,523
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:49,523
Hold it!

155
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,123
-Are you all right? -Yes.

156
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,423
Darn, not again.

157
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:12,023
"Osanai Finance"

158
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:18,823
This is...

159
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,770
Mayuko, did you regain your memory?

160
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,770
You recall where the jewelry is then, don't you?

161
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,170
You finally spit it out.

162
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,870
Conan?

163
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,570
I wrote that.

164
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,670
"I have something to tell you. -from Mayuko"

165
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,770
Mayuko's back at the hospital.

166
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,970
Just what do you mean?

167
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,670
Kanae, you're not really the younger sister

168
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,570
of the suspect of the robbery, Mr. Nonomiya Kengo, are you?

169
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,870
Oh no?

170
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,470
You gotta be joking?

171
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,570
After thinking it out a little, it should've been obvious.

172
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,770
In the case that the suspect denies the allegations,

173
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,870
it is difficult for anyone except the lawyer

174
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,270
to meet with the suspect, be it his relatives.

175
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,970
Nevertheless...

176
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,370
But when I visited him at the police,

177
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,570
my brother definitely told me

178
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,570
that he was innocent.

179
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,370
No... I really...

180
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,870
I know who you actually are, already.

181
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,170
Conan.

182
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,670
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,770
Look at this.

184
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,170
It's a contract for a loan.

185
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,970
Kanae Nishida?

186
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,470
Ishida?

187
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,570
Then, just as I thought?

188
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,570
You didn't play the role

189
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,470
of the suspect Nonomiya's younger sister to clear his charges.

190
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,370
But rather because you wanted the jewelry, isn't that right?

191
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,870
Acting as his younger sister

192
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,570
will give you away as soon as someone checks on you.

193
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,570
She was that desperate about her debts.

194
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,670
Exactly.

195
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,970
Some trashy man hoodwinked me into getting loans to support him.

196
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,770
And the finance company also turned out to be a wicked one too.

197
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,270
After midnight the day before yesterday,

198
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,770
I visited Mayuko's apartment hoping to borrow money from her.

199
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,370
There...

200
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,770
Where's the jewelry?

201
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,870
How should I know?

202
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,970
Come.

203
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,070
Let me go!

204
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,570
I didn't know what was going on at that time but...

205
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,670
The following day,

206
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,570
I saw the news about the jewelry robbery

207
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,870
and everything fell into place.

208
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,970
The remark of Mr. Nonomiya who that was aired on the news wasn't a lie.

209
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,670
That guy struck Mr. Nonomiya and set him up as a scapegoat,

210
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,570
and Mayuko was a witness to this, he said.

211
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,270
Come to think of it,

212
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,470
everything but the part about Mayuko being the eye-witness

213
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,770
was aired on the news.

214
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,170
I don't know what happened between the two,

215
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,770
but I figured that Mayuko betrayed the man

216
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,970
and hid the jewelry some place.

217
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,170
If I play it right,

218
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,770
I thought I could also get rid of my debts.

219
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,770
That's why I rushed to look for Mayuko's whereabouts.

220
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,270
But, when I finally found her, Mayuko was suffering from memory loss.

221
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,270
I was at a loss as to what to do.

222
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,770
After that, I carelessly happened to tell

223
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,270
the president of the finance company who came to collect money

224
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,670
"Osanai Norio (38)" -about the jewelry.

225
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,470
Then...

226
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,970
He conned you into act as Mr. Nonomiya's younger sister

227
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,770
and contact us.

228
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,670
So, that you would find out where the jewelry is from Mayuko,

229
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,370
after which they planned to take it away.

230
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,070
Hello?

231
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,570
Yes, that's right.

232
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,670
Dad, it's from the Okayama Police.

233
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,870
They tracked the guy down with the license plate number

234
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,270
that Conan reported

235
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,270
to the police and arrested him, right?

236
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,870
Me, the one who robbed the jewelry store?

237
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,570
Give me a break.

238
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,970
All I did was try to snatch the jewelry from the side.

239
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,370
My company's in hot water too,

240
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,170
that's why I...

241
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,670
He seems to have admitted that he attempted to kidnap Ms. Mayuko

242
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,970
at the Bikan Historical District,

243
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,370
but he seems to be denying all else.

244
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,170
I'm sure he's just trying to get away with it.

245
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,570
The man who attacked Mayuko at the observation deck

246
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,570
was also that guy Osanai.

247
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,170
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

248
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,470
Ran.

249
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,470
Yes.

250
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,970
Do you remember any characteristics of the man who attacked Mayuko

251
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,770
at the observation deck?

252
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,170
Characteristic?

253
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,970
Help, somebody!

254
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,170
Right. That man was left-handed.

255
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,670
Osanai is right-handed.

256
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:27,870
In other words, there were two people who were going after Mayuko.

257
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,470
One was the right-handed man who cooperated with Mayuko

258
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,470
and followed us,

259
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,670
the president of the finance company, Osanai.

260
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,970
And, the other one is the jewelry store robber.

261
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,870
The guy who attacked Mayuko at the observation deck,

262
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,270
who on earth was he?

263
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,270
Mr. Mouri, please cut the Gordian knot.

264
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,970
In fact, the culprit was depicted

265
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,770
in the sketches drawn by Mayuko to begin with.

266
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,070
What?

267
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,870
Look at the last sketch.

268
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,870
Yes.

269
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,470
The sketch of the grapes.

270
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,670
This depicts the culprit...

271
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,570
Come to think of it,

272
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,670
you mentioned you were a sommelier some time in the past?

273
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,970
Yes.

274
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,470
If I'm not mistaken,

275
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,770
sommelier's wear badges the shape of grapes, don't they?

276
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,970
The shiny thing that was on the chest of the man

277
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,570
in the picture at Mayuko's house, whose face was all torn off,

278
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,570
wasn't that a sommelier badge?

279
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,470
Besides, just before Mayuko was attacked at the observatory deck...

280
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,470
I'm sorry, the editor just called me.

281
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,770
I'll be back in about an hour,

282
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,370
so please go on and eat without me.

283
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,870
You excused yourself, didn't you?

284
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,370
What's with that look in your eyes?

285
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,270
Are you suspecting me?

286
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,970
The man at the observatory deck was hit on the head

287
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,870
with the can that Conan kicked towards him. Mr. Nashida,

288
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,670
why are you suddenly wearing a cap?

289
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,870
Just what are you talking about?

290
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,670
I'm not hiding a wound or anything. See.

291
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,070
See.

292
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,670
No. It's not Mr. Nashida.

293
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,470
What? Is that right?

294
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,470
The sketch is depicted something else.

295
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,470
Conan.

296
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,170
Ran, the sketch of the grapes is not the sommelier badge but this.

297
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,770
This...

298
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,070
This is how you're supposed to look at it, right, pops?

299
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,870
This is Mr. Taira's Muscat parfait.

300
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,670
It's the same as the mirror trick.

301
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,870
When you change the angle,

302
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,270
something different comes into view.

303
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,870
Mr. Taira most probably left-handed.

304
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,970
Conan watched Mr. Nashida and Mr. Taira shaking hands at the hospital.

305
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,770
Mr. Nashida stuck out his left hand

306
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,870
because he knew that Mr. Taira was left-handed. Isn't that right?

307
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,570
Yes. Exactly.

308
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,370
Come to think of it,

309
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,970
the man from that time was also left-handed.

310
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,870
Mr. Taira, I think it's about time you come out.

311
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,070
I know you've been listening from over there for some time now.

312
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,270
Without money,

313
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,870
I couldn't get a hold of a new shop.

314
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,870
The banks wouldn't lend me money either

315
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,370
because I went out of business gambling.

316
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,870
That's why I made Mayuko help and carried out the robbery.

317
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,570
You mean Mayuko was an accomplice in the robbery?

318
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,270
She probably helped keep on the look out, or drive the car?

319
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,270
Yes, exactly.

320
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,170
But, that guy happened to see what happened.

321
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,870
You went ahead to Mayuko's apartment

322
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,470
and caught her trying to get back the jewelry

323
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,670
but since Mayuko fell down the stairs

324
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,270
and you were surprised by Kanae's scream, you fled.

325
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,870
After that when you found out from the website of the Town Magazine

326
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,370
that Mayuko was suffering from loss of memory

327
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,170
and that I was investigating the case,

328
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,370
you got rid of the evidence that pointed to you

329
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,670
and Mayuko having any connection with each other from her room

330
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,070
and got into contact with us under disguise

331
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,670
in order to get the jewelry back.

332
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,970
Hello.

333
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,470
Yes, that's right.

334
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,570
Really?

335
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,970
Dad, Mayuko disappeared from the hospital.

336
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,870
Conan?

337
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,370
So, you did get her memory back after all.

338
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,470
Mr. Mouri?

339
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,970
You mumbled the following at the Bikan Historical District.

340
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,270
What a beautiful moon.

341
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,270
Back then, you were remembering

342
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,670
the scenery that you once saw when you were there.

343
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,170
I tried time and time again to get back on my feet.

344
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,970
But, each time, I was betrayed by the person I trusted.

345
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,970
I fell in love with Taira and when he asked me run a shop together,

346
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,170
I made up my mind that this time is the right time.

347
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,370
That's when Taira told me about robbing the jewelry store.

348
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,770
If there was no way out of my situation I thought.

349
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,770
Why not take everything for myself?

350
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,170
I figured I'd become more evil plunge farther into the pits.

351
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,270
But you were crying

352
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,970
after seeing the boiling pot ritual.

353
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,070
You requested a reading wanting to get rid of your past

354
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,570
and start over again.

355
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,470
If you got your memory back,

356
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,970
I'm sure you can remember how you felt back then.

357
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,670
Ran was saying

358
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,070
I admire Ms. Mayuko.

359
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,770
I'll bet she's actually a very strong person.

360
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,170
Ran said that?

361
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,770
I'm sure that she's praying

362
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,770
that you'd get back on your feet this time for sure.

363
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,270
The following day,

364
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,970
Mayuko Kichise was arrested and from her testimony

365
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,570
Mr. Keigo Nonomiya was released.

366
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,270
Finally... finally!

367
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,570
I get to eat octopus rice and drink beer.

368
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,570
Dad, we're going to miss our Bullet train.

369
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,970
Oh, no!

370
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,970
-Just come! -Octopus rice! Beer!
