1
00:00:01,108 --> 00:00:04,358
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:06,338
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:08,348
Today is a sad sisterly bond!

4
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:10,008
Have you solved
the sealed room mystery?

5
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:11,808
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,808
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:16,268
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:59,221
On our way to Okino Yoko's concert,
the old guy lost his ticket.

9
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,681
But he just happened
to meet Aoshima Masayo,

10
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:07,061
who promised to give him a ticket
if he picked up her younger sister.

11
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:13,021
However, her sister, Aoshima Mina,

12
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:16,831
was found dead inside a
completely-sealed bathroom!

13
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:22,121
Not only were the door and
window taped from the inside,

14
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:26,391
but the word "goodbye" was
spelled out in tape on the door!

15
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:33,061
Also, because only the sister's
fingerprints were found on the tape,

16
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:36,391
the old guy and Inspector
Megure deemed it a suicide, but...

17
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:41,851
No! This wasn't a suicide!

18
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:45,431
Mina-san's killer was Masayo-san!

19
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:50,891
"The Sealed Bathroom Murder Case (Part 2)."

20
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,361
Inspector Megure!

21
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:58,161
Oh! Takagi-kun!

22
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,121
So, did you check the
convenience store angle?

23
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,891
Yes.

24
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,811
At around 7:00 last night,

25
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:10,001
she bought two bathroom detergents,
some tape, and two cans of beer.

26
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,601
Cans of beer?

27
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:16,811
There were two empty cans in the kitchen,
along with sleeping pills.

28
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,011
She probably couldn't work
up the nerve to kill herself sober.

29
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,221
So, how did Mina-san
seem when she bought it?

30
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:27,561
Right... apparently, she seemed
no different than usual. It's just...

31
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,401
It's just what?

32
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,971
Oh, no, it's nothing really.

33
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:38,181
So it was clearly a suicide!
Suicide, suicide!

34
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,411
Detective!

35
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,831
It's just what?

36
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:47,851
Well, you see, the shop
owner said something strange.

37
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,461
As she was checking out, Mina-san...

38
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,851
By the way, Inspector. What time is it?

39
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,801
Oh, the time?

40
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:58,141
See? Isn't that strange?

41
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:02,511
But the room was sealed,
and it seems clear it was a suicide...

42
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:08,231
You should tell the inspector!
I bet it'll prove it wasn't... a suicide...

43
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:15,901
Hey! What's that?!

44
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,571
The peephole?

45
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,541
The black dirt above it!

46
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,661
Th-This is a bloodstain!

47
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,971
Bloodstain?!

48
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,521
Y-Yes...

49
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,591
But what's this doing here?

50
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,831
Mina!

51
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,021
K-Kenji!

52
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:44,181
Is it... Is it true
that Mina killed herself?!

53
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:45,681
Yes...

54
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:48,481
But, Kenji! How did you know?!

55
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:53,721
We informed him.

56
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:59,691
He'd left a message on her machine
at her estimated time of death.

57
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:04,951
So I looked through her
address book and called him here.

58
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:09,681
Why? Why would Mina commit suicide?!

59
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,311
If I'd known this would happen,

60
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,031
I would've broken
through a window then!

61
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,751
"Then"?!

62
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,021
Did you come here last night?!

63
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:22,721
Yes! After I left my message!

64
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,371
S-Seriously?!

65
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,681
Yeah! I did!

66
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:29,931
But no one answered the doorbell,

67
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:34,601
and I waited in front of the door awhile,
but she never came home.

68
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,401
I figured she already went
to bed and left!

69
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,321
And that's how I caught this cold!

70
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,371
Wait a minute! Does that mean...

71
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,241
...that bloodstain was...

72
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:52,021
But isn't it strange to visit her
after getting the answering machine?

73
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:55,501
We had planned to have dinner together...

74
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,721
And Mina always had
the answering machine on.

75
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:02,921
Getting the machine
didn't mean she wasn't home...

76
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:07,021
But never mind that, Detective!
Take me to Mina!

77
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:07,681
A-Alright.

78
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,641
I see! So that's how it was!

79
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:14,101
The trick to the room sealed with tape!

80
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,061
The intriguing bloodstain on the door!

81
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:21,641
And the strange
feeling that was bugging me!

82
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:25,721
I've figured it all
out very clearly now!

83
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:28,031
The killer was, without question...

84
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:32,001
Without question,
it was her, Masayo-san!

85
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:39,061
She brought us here to
complete this sealed room murder!

86
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:43,761
Unaware she's been holding
definitive proof the whole time!

87
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:48,721
Suicide, suicide! It was clearly
a suicide, Inspector!

88
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:54,061
The tape on the inside of
the door and window

89
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:57,691
completely sealed this room off.

90
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:02,931
And judging from the dying
words written in tape on that door

91
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:06,611
and the fact only Mina-san's
fingerprints are on the tape...

92
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:12,811
I can only think that she slit
her wrist to commit suicide in here.

93
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,581
Mori-san. Umm...

94
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,721
Oh, Masayo-san.

95
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:19,541
Uhh, here...

96
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:23,171
The ticket to tonight's
concert I promised you...

97
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:28,591
I'm really sorry to go at a time like this!

98
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,561
Well, Inspector! I should be going!

99
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,811
Wait! Mori-kun!
We haven't questioned you yet!

100
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:41,611
It's okay, it's okay! I promise to
drop by the station after the concert!

101
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,491
M-Mori-kun!

102
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,391
Hey...

103
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:00,321
Mister!

104
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,251
Hey! Mori-kun!

105
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,721
Don't tell me it's happening again?!

106
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:06,461
It? What?

107
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:11,391
It just struck me. I've figured it all out.

108
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:15,431
I've figured out how the killer
managed to seal this bathroom!

109
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,100
Killer? You were
just saying it was a suicide!

110
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,520
Yes, please forget everything
I said earlier. I was only joking.

111
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,630
Sheesh.

112
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,710
Mina-san didn't commit suicide.

113
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,050
She was murdered.

114
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,890
By you, Masayo-san! Her older sister!

115
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,770
Masayo-san?!

116
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,280
H-Hey, now! Is it true, Masayo?!

117
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,990
Don't be silly! You know
I'd never kill my little sister!

118
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,400
Besides, you should
know more than anyone here

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,170
that the bathroom was sealed
off and we had to bust the door open!

120
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,130
She's right, Mori-kun.

121
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,270
If you claim Masayo-san killed her,
then would you mind telling us

122
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,840
how she miraculously managed
to leave a completely sealed room?!

123
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,760
Miraculously?

124
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,560
It's nothing that special at all.

125
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,850
The method is so extremely
simple that anyone can do it.

126
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,820
First, Inspector. Please
close the bathroom door for now.

127
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,860
Like that?

128
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,940
How does the door look to you?

129
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,740
H-How?

130
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,500
H-Hey! You don't mean--?!

131
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,980
That's right.

132
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,460
The tape on the inside is
placed on the glass in such a way

133
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,550
to make it appear to
be sealed from the inside.

134
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,220
Masayo-san used this
illusion to her advantage.

135
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,610
Just because your
answering machine is on

136
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,610
doesn't mean you aren't home.

137
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,730
It's the same as that.

138
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,740
Then this door... was unsealed
from the very start?

139
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,940
Yes.

140
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,700
Masayo-san most likely knocked
her sister out with sleeping pills,

141
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,000
carried her in here,
and taped up the window and door.

142
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,960
Then, after cutting her wrist...

143
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,430
...she forcefully
opened the sealed door...

144
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,640
...went out, and closed the door again.

145
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,060
The inside of the door is a blind spot!

146
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,940
If the tape had been undone beforehand,

147
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,860
there'd be no way to tell when
it happened once you went inside.

148
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,820
B-But you said you had
a hard time getting inside!

149
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,280
Yes, I was completely
fooled by Masayo-san's acting.

150
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,830
At that time...

151
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,790
Ready, go!

152
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,690
...it was Masayo-san whose
hand was on the knob.

153
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,360
Turning the knob at just the right time,

154
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,840
she made it look like we
had just forced the door open

155
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,560
and planted the idea in our minds
that this room had been sealed off.

156
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:47,060
Of course, she needed someone
who'd fall for this trick for it to work.

157
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:55,700
That's why she brought us here.
To act as a stand-in for Kenji-san.

158
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,040
B-But, Mori-kun!

159
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,000
Only her sister's fingerprints
were on these pieces of tape!

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,110
Plus, the end of each strip has prints

161
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,520
from both index fingers and thumbs!

162
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,340
How did that happen?!

163
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,300
Packing.

164
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,140
P-Packing?

165
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,310
Before killing her sister,
Masayo-san had her help pack

166
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,770
by tearing strips of
tape off and lining them up.

167
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,480
She then used that tape to
seal the bathroom window and door

168
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,030
and write out, "Goodbye."

169
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,030
Of course, she wore gloves
to keep her own fingerprints off.

170
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,110
As proof, there are cardboard boxes
that had once been put together

171
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,000
and tape residue along the table
that the strips had been affixed to.

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,210
The examiner already
knows about this, though.

173
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,980
Incidentally, Masayo-san.
It was also you who sent your sister

174
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,890
to buy the necessary tape
and two bathroom detergents.

175
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,560
You first planned to seal the room

176
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,520
and kill your sister by mixing
the two detergents together.

177
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,770
But she had bought the same types,
which wouldn't produce a gas.

178
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,450
Having realized this
after sealing the room,

179
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,410
you quickly chose to cut her
wrist so she'd die of blood loss instead.

180
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,530
Or something along
these lines, anyway, Masayo-san.

181
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,630
M-Masayo?!

182
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,060
Yes... if it's just as you say,
I could have done it,

183
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:49,020
and I am most suspect, being a
former resident as well as her sister.

184
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:55,230
But did you see me seal the room with tape?

185
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,990
Did you see me cut my sister's wrist?

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,310
You can quibble all you want,
but fantasy is still just fantasy.

187
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,400
You have no proof at all.

188
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,670
After all, it's possible the room
really was sealed shut with tape.

189
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,380
Isn't that right, Inspector?

190
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,300
H-Hey! What now, Mori-kun?!

191
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,260
She's correct.

192
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
D-Dad!

193
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,730
I have no clear
proof whatsoever of this trick.

194
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,900
Mori!

195
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,150
But...

196
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,610
...there are signs
that you killed your sister!

197
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,530
Definitive evidence
that can't be explained away!

198
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,370
Wh-What, now?!

199
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,610
Kenji-san. You said
you came here last night.

200
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,830
Y-Yes.

201
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,810
How long did you ring
the doorbell, would you say?

202
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,420
I rang it a lot.

203
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,710
She was late for our date,
so I thought she might be sulking inside.

204
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,310
I see. It's just as I thought.

205
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:11,270
Wh-What is? What's "just as
you thought"? Just come out with it!

206
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,730
Masayo-san. You were still
at home at that time, weren't you?

207
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:25,110
And you checked on the annoying
visitor through the peephole...

208
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,290
...with your sister's blood still on you!

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,940
Please check the front door.

210
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,440
You'll find a bloodstain from then still there.

211
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,270
Right, Detective Takagi?

212
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,380
Yes.

213
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:48,390
But... But so what?!
My sister could've left that blood there!

214
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,110
Using something that vague as proof...

215
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,320
And you call yourself a great detect--?

216
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,620
Yes... it's still there...

217
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,300
...a bloodstain that perfectly
matches the one on the front door.

218
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,220
Masayo-san. It's right there on
the black bandana around your head!

219
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,060
Now, would you mind
explaining, Masayo-san,

220
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,580
why your sister's
blood is on that bandana

221
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,070
that came with
a CD released yesterday?

222
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,520
B-But, Mori-kun!

223
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,120
How do you know she had the
bandana on at the time of the crime?!

224
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,290
The logo.

225
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,250
The logo on the bandana.

226
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:06,560
The real logo has a dash over
the first "o" to lengthen the vowel.

227
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,220
The fact it's missing means
something is covering it up.

228
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,900
My sister's blood must've
landed there and covered it up.

229
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,070
But how did you know, Mori-san?

230
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,270
You don't own a
bandana of your own, right?

231
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:34,520
No... something always seemed off,
but I couldn't put my finger on it.

232
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,750
Until I saw the logo on the key
holder and the blood stain on the door

233
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,720
and learned that Kenji-san
had rung the doorbell last night.

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,310
I see.

235
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,710
So this key holder I showed off
to you wound up being my downfall.

236
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
Then you admit to the crime?

237
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,030
Yes, take me down
to the station or wherever.

238
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,990
B-But why would you kill Mina?!
You were such close sisters!

239
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,950
I guess we were too close.

240
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,520
My sister Mina was always
following in my footsteps.

241
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,920
She'd like the same idols I did,
buy the same bags and clothes I did,

242
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,890
she'd even copy the
furniture and dishes I had!

243
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,850
At first, I thought it was cute.
She was my little sister.

244
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,810
But, one day, after it
started to get on my nerves,

245
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,730
she smiled with an innocent
look on her face and told me...

246
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,060
I'm sorry, Sis!

247
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,700
I fell in love with the same person
you like and confessed to him!

248
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,190
Wait! Does that mean--?!

249
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,660
Yes, that's right. It was you,
after we had gone out for five years!

250
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,270
So we wound up competing for you,

251
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,380
and in the end,
she and you got engaged

252
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,200
and I had no choice but to move out.

253
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:19,400
I wanted to get rid of the little
devil who stole everything from me!

254
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,060
I wanted her out of my sight!

255
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,560
Y-You have it wrong, Masayo!

256
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,730
I was the one who
insisted on getting married!

257
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,110
She kept turning me down, of course!

258
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,520
She said she wanted to focus
on patching things up with her sister.

259
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
Y-You're lying! She said she
kept insisting on getting married!

260
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,540
That was the condition she gave
when she accepted my proposal.

261
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,520
She didn't want you to
know I chose her over you,

262
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,470
because you have more
pride than most people!

263
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:03,270
Stop with this nonsense! She was
too selfish to ever think about me...

264
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,190
There's no way to know
your sister's true feelings now,

265
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,580
but it's clear she
really cared about you.

266
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,160
Wh-What would... What would you know?!

267
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,420
The convenience store owner said this...

268
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,190
While he rang up her items,

269
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,880
your sister went to
get a different detergent.

270
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,940
To get a kind that wouldn't
accidentally produce chlorine gas

271
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,810
if you mixed it with the other one.

272
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,640
To protect your life.

273
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,360
Th-That can't be...

274
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,960
Th-That can't be true...

275
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,470
Mina!

276
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,610
Hey! Hey! Mina!

277
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,450
Tell me it's not true!

278
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,770
Mina! Mina!

279
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,530
Mina! Talk to me, Mina!

280
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,860
Mina!

281
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,150
Mina!

282
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,190
Kindness brought forth hate
and transformed into murderous intent...

283
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,900
Amid the echoes of
the sinner's regretful cries,

284
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,640
twin cups and toothbrushes sat
quietly by each other at the mirror.

285
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,030
As if they had forgotten
the happy memories

286
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,360
of when they had once been used.

287
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,560
Encore! Encore!

288
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,400
Encore! Encore! Encore!

289
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,760
Yoko-chan!

290
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,650
Oh, my gorgeous Yoko-chan!

291
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,560
Mori-san!

292
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,560
You really came!

293
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,400
But of course!

294
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,270
I'm so happy!

295
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,500
Don't, Yoko-chan!

296
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,150
You shouldn't act that
happy in front of your fans!

297
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,650
I dunno why, but he's
smiling while he's sleeping.

298
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,500
He must be having a dream
where he made it to the concert.

299
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,740
Really, you shouldn't!

300
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,480
Yoko-chan!

301
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,700
Newscaster Aki-san is missing?!
Was she threatened?!

302
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,580
No, she didn't seem afraid at all then!

303
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,540
If that call had been
a trap to lure her somewhere--!

304
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,590
End of the line!

305
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,910
On the next Conan--

306
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,430
"The Weather Lady Abduction Case."
