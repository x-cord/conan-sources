1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,940
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,840
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,640
Good old country house.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,540
Attracting the tourists and attracting a crime or two.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:13,368
This is really a charming place.

9
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:16,068
There's something that feels familiar about this place!

10
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,268
"Nostal sick", as they say.

11
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,368
That's not it, Genta.

12
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:25,968
You mean nostalgic.

13
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,668
Since when did they change it?

14
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:31,568
Just how old do you think you are, anyway?

15
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,368
It certainly looks like a place that is talked of a lot

16
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:38,268
since it's going to be selected as a World Heritage.

17
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,168
Recently there's talk about something else

18
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:44,168
that is attracting people to come and see this place.

19
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,668
What is that, Conan?

20
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,668
What is it?

21
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,868
That is...

22
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,568
-The ghost story! -The ghost story.

23
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:57,568
Oh, you meanies, all of you.

24
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:02,168
Are there talks about a ghost?

25
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,868
From about half a year ago,

26
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:07,168
people started saying they witnessed a child ghost,

27
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,468
and the rumor seems to have spread.

28
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,068
Geez.

29
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:16,468
Don't you guys know this tour is a gift for solving a case?

30
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:19,868
Why don't you try to get a taste of good old Japan?

31
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,368
Indeed. For god's sake.

32
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,268
I'll try to get a taste of good old beer.

33
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,268
Come on in, sir!

34
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,068
That's him all right.

35
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:37,068
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 1)"

36
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:42,368
This place really makes me feel as if we've time warped.

37
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:46,268
So, this is where we will stay for the night?

38
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,468
This place is a world heritage and inn for tourists.

39
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:52,468
This is really good old Japan.

40
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:55,468
There are three floors inside,

41
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,368
so it has more rooms than it looks like it has when seen from outside.

42
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:01,468
There must have been a large family living here.

43
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,668
Huh? That is...

44
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:05,668
What is it, Conan?

45
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:09,968
Well, the stone and the soil around the stone are new.

46
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:13,468
For a hundred year old house of heritage, it's strange...

47
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:17,968
They are going to stay with us.

48
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,968
Hello!

49
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,468
-Hello, nice meeting you. -Hello, nice meeting you.

50
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:24,068
Oh, the inn with the high rooftop.

51
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:25,468
Rumiko is very impressed!

52
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:26,968
So is Kanako!

53
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,768
What an old stinking place!

54
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:32,068
Can I take a hot bath?

55
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:33,968
"Kensaku Kawaji (37)" -How about air conditioning?

56
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:37,068
I guess you can't expect these things.

57
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,968
He's awful.

58
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,868
Rumiko, he'll hear you!

59
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:44,568
Did you say something, sisters?

60
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:47,268
You stop it! Don't be childish.

61
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,068
You're embarrassing them.

62
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:51,568
What did you say?

63
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,468
I'm embarrassing you?

64
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:55,368
You said so, didn't you?

65
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:58,268
Stop it. How unsightly of you.

66
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,968
Did you tell me to stop?

67
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,468
Who are you, dirty old man?

68
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,968
If you want to address me at all,

69
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,268
you can call me,

70
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:07,168
Kogoro Mouri.

71
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,668
Mouri?

72
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,368
He means that...

73
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,068
The famous detective, Sleeping Kogoro?

74
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:16,768
They call me by that name, in spite of myself.

75
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,768
Did you hear that? "In spite of myself"! So theatrical

76
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,168
No, I didn't.

77
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:23,768
Awesome! Rumiko is so impressed!

78
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,468
So you're a famous person, pops!

79
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:27,468
Stop it, ladies.

80
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:31,568
You are making my beer spill over.

81
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:34,768
"Shokichi Sakaki (52)" -My name is Shokichi Sakaki.

82
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,268
I'm honored to meet you, Mr. Mouri.

83
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:39,968
"Kazuaki Kuwashima (44)" -I'm Kazuaki Kuwashima.

84
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,168
Glad to meet you, sir.

85
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:44,468
And I am glad to meet you, gentlemen.

86
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:46,468
What a bore!

87
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:49,068
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:50,968
What?

89
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:53,068
"Iwao Nagakura (50), Kimiko Nagakura (45)" -Your inn is located

90
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,268
a block down, at Ishioka house.

91
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,768
Why didn't you tell them sooner?

92
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,568
How delicious! This pot of soup!

93
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,468
This iwana fish is so delicious too.

94
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:15,568
Delicious...

95
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:17,668
The aroma of this miso soup is so fine.

96
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,068
Yes. It warms your body.

97
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:23,068
Well, this hot sake is the best for winter.

98
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,368
Take one, please.

99
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:27,068
Thank you, sir. I will.

100
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:29,368
Lay off!

101
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,468
They made it up and put it on the magazine.

102
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:35,668
It's not real and you won't see it here.

103
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:39,668
Dear!

104
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,768
Don't you be rude to our guests.

105
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,368
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,268
We're facing a few problems recently...

107
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:48,968
What was that all about?

108
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:51,468
It's this, Ran. This article.

109
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:54,568
What about it?

110
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:57,768
"Ghost seen at the World Heritage site"?

111
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,968
Unexpected busy business bewilders people of the district.

112
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:03,268
"Unexpected selling point"?

113
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:05,368
We don't need any ghosts here.

114
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,568
What a nuisance!

115
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:08,568
I see.

116
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:09,868
It should be.

117
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:12,668
A world heritage is the pride of the world.

118
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:15,968
So much so that it is an asset to all mankind.

119
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,168
It must have been a fuss for you.

120
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:23,468
How dare they use it to attract curious people here

121
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:25,068
as if this were another tourist attraction

122
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,168
Here.

123
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,668
It must be tough.

124
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,168
Now this is for you.

125
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:32,768
I'm just doing my share to welcome you...

126
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,068
That's Mr. Mouri!

127
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,968
Your words are precious to us.

128
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,068
Now you can drink to that.

129
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,568
Well, thanks to you, I will.

130
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,668
You're the one to enjoy drinking.

131
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:45,868
Off you go with more drinks.

132
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:48,868
Hey. Now they have started...

133
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,868
Well, we are leaving now...

134
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:52,768
Thanks for everything!

135
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,568
-Good night. -Good night.

136
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,568
You've done your share, guys.

137
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,368
Now let's drink up once more.

138
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:01,168
It's so delicious!

139
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:03,968
-Conan, we should be going now. -Okay.

140
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,868
What are we going to do? Sleep?

141
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,468
No way.

142
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:10,468
How can we go to sleep before making sure

143
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:11,868
if the ghost is real or not?

144
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:12,868
Of course.

145
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:17,368
Sure. We are here to search for facts!

146
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,868
Aren't we, Conan?

147
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:20,568
Me?

148
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,768
It suits you, Conan. Go with them.

149
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,468
I'll pass.

150
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:26,268
I'm staying here and going to read a book in the room.

151
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:27,568
Haibara!

152
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,468
What's the matter with you, Conan?

153
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:38,568
It's nothing.

154
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,268
By the way, we'll go take a walk for a while.

155
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,068
At this time of the day?

156
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,568
It's not that late.

157
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:49,168
Besides, I get to see the attraction over there.

158
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,568
Beware of fire!

159
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:01,668
Beware of fire!

160
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:05,268
I'm scared but it's beautiful!

161
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,968
It doesn't surprise me if it comes up in this setup.

162
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:10,668
They do it every evening.

163
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:14,068
Each house sends someone in turn for the night watch.

164
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:17,668
Yes. Fire is the biggest enemy to a house with thatched roofs.

165
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,668
The best they can do is take precautions against fire for themselves.

166
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,368
The whole village takes and shares responsibility...

167
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:25,568
In a way, this is very reasonable.

168
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,868
All's well.

169
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,468
Good job and thank you.

170
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,068
Beware of fire!

171
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,568
Who...

172
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,968
Are you?

173
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,268
Hey, who are you?

174
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,868
Beware of fire!

175
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:55,768
Where's Ayumi?

176
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,768
She was with us a moment ago.

177
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:59,068
Ayumi!

178
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:00,868
How did she get lost?

179
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,168
Ayumi!

180
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,568
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

181
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:08,768
I'm sure she was with us here.

182
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:12,068
I say she got hungry and went back to the inn alone.

183
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,568
Well, she is not like you, Genta.

184
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:16,268
Are you sure?

185
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,068
-What's that? -What?

186
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,168
Did you find her?

187
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:26,468
It's Ayumi's scarf.

188
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,068
I'm sure it is.

189
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:41,968
Wait.

190
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:43,268
What's your name?

191
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,168
Who are you?

192
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,068
Wait, don't leave me behind!

193
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,168
Wait!

194
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:52,368
Oh? Ayumi's lost?

195
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,968
I'm sorry. I guess we weren't careful enough.

196
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:59,268
We decided we should come back and search for her with more people.

197
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:02,168
I see. Let's all go look for her together.

198
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:04,568
Dad!

199
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,468
Gosh!

200
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:12,268
Come on, dad.

201
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:15,168
My husband too.

202
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:17,868
He never stops drinking once he starts drinking.

203
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:20,668
Let me call the villagers to help with the search.

204
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:23,268
-Sorry for the inconvenience. -Thank you.

205
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:24,568
I'll help you too.

206
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:25,668
Yeah.

207
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:28,468
Hey! What's the matter?

208
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:29,968
Is something wrong?

209
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,368
I'm gonna help you.

210
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:32,768
You can't and don't.

211
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:33,868
What's the matter with you?

212
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:35,968
I'm not trying to sell anything to you.

213
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,468
Ayumi!

214
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,768
-Ayumi! -Ayumi...

215
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,668
We've found her!

216
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,968
She's at the root of a Japanese cedar tree at Water God Shrine!

217
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,168
Ayumi!

218
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:07,468
Come on, Ayumi!

219
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:08,768
Ayumi!

220
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,990
What? Conan?

221
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,090
Ayumi!

222
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,890
Are you all right?

223
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,090
Oh, everybody.

224
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,290
Do you feel any pain?

225
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,890
You appear to be free from injuries but...

226
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,390
I'm all right. No pain at all.

227
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,190
Can you talk for a while?

228
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,790
Yes.

229
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,090
What actually happened?

230
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,390
It's...

231
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,390
Did you see a girl?

232
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,490
I did.

233
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,690
She was about 10 years old, bobbed hair,

234
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,590
and wearing a red skirt,

235
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,890
Impossible!

236
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,290
It can't be.

237
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,990
Mr. Nagakura...

238
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,490
She came to see Eiji. Mami did come.

239
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,590
Mami?

240
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,790
That girl. Her name is Mami?

241
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,990
Yes.

242
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,790
Mami and Eiji had been friends since childhood.

243
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,690
Mami was a year younger

244
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,890
and they were very close friends.

245
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,690
Yes. I'm sure it's her.

246
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,290
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty and comes to see him.

247
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,490
Not guilty?

248
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,690
Cut it out!

249
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,390
Young lady,

250
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,390
you've mistaken something else for her,

251
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,990
I'm sure of it.

252
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,490
What?

253
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,290
But how do you know?

254
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,290
I'm sure I saw her.

255
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,290
Do you doubt her, pops?

256
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,590
Ayumi is an honest girl. She doesn't tell lies.

257
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,090
Calm down, everybody!

258
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,790
Well, why are you certain that she saw wrong, Mr. Nagakura?

259
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,390
It's obvious!

260
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,690
Because both of them...

261
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,990
Eiji since last month,

262
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,490
and that girl since ten years ago,

263
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,090
have been dead.

264
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,990
What?

265
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,190
Died ten years ago?

266
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,290
Then she was...

267
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,690
A ghost...

268
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,190
I can't stand that kind of a story.

269
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,990
-So it's true after all. -So they appeared.

270
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,690
I'm scared...

271
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,990
Don't you worry, Keiko.

272
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,390
What's the fuss all about?

273
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,890
Where have you been all this time, dad?

274
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,490
What?

275
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,790
All of you...

276
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,490
Who's behind all this?

277
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,490
Dear...

278
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,490
What?

279
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,790
I got it. They are behind all this!

280
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,490
They?

281
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,390
You can't fool me with such a trick!

282
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,590
You won't have your way with me, never!

283
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,290
And Eiji.

284
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,190
That fellow is not my son!

285
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,790
Keep that in mind!

286
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,490
How can you say that! How cruel, Eiji just...

287
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,390
You hold your tongue!

288
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,490
Calm down, Mr. Nagakura.

289
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,290
The sake took hold of you.

290
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,490
That's right.

291
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,390
Cool down and have more hot sake, and you'll be...

292
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,090
Leave me alone!

293
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,790
I smell something.

294
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,590
This village has something other than a ghost.

295
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,590
Yeah.

296
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,990
It seems worth investigating.

297
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,890
Right.

298
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,490
Was that a ghost?

299
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,890
That Mami...

300
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,190
"Otozawa" -The house of Otozawa.

301
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,690
This is where Mami had been living

302
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,890
with her parents until 10 years ago.

303
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,590
She was the only child in the family.

304
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,690
Hey, Ayumi!

305
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,090
Mami died of a disease.

306
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,290
And then the parents moved out to some other place.

307
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,890
Are there any photos left?

308
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,390
Maybe not, it's been 10 years now.

309
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,090
We can tell if what Yoshida saw was real or not

310
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,290
with a photo of her.

311
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,290
That's right!

312
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,390
How well your mind works, Haibara.

313
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,290
Real? You mean the ghost?

314
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,190
Hey, you of all people start talking like that...

315
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,390
Don't you believe her, Conan?

316
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,790
Don't you know

317
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,390
I'm the detective who is making his way with logic and reasoning?

318
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,790
There is no place for a ghost in...

319
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,690
We're not asking anything of the sort.

320
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,790
What?

321
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,090
They're both asking you if you believe in Yoshida.

322
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,690
No. I...

323
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,490
Ayumi!

324
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,890
You'll pay for this, Conan!

325
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,190
Geez.

326
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,390
And now we go for Eiji.

327
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,890
What? Oh, yeah.

328
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,990
Suicide?

329
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,790
Eiji Nagakura killed himself?

330
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,890
Yes. There is no doubt about it.

331
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,090
Since you asked me,

332
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,790
I checked on Eiji Nagakura in the crime articles in the newspaper

333
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,390
and I found one.

334
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,290
It took place half a year ago

335
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,090
in the town of Shoujin.

336
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,290
It's right next to this village you are staying in.

337
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,990
They found his fingerprints at the scene.

338
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,690
He was wanted and he probably gave up on running.

339
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,690
Eiji Nagakura is a jewelry robber who committed suicide.

340
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,790
But his mother believes him to be innocent.

341
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,990
That's why the villagers were reluctant to talk.

342
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,390
Conan.

343
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,490
I didn't tell a lie.

344
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,890
I really saw her, Mami.

345
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,690
I want you to believe me, Conan.

346
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,590
So I want you to...

347
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,290
You want him to investigate, don't you?

348
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,890
Yes.

349
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,290
Of course he will do it for you and just for you.

350
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,990
Haibara, are you serious?

351
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,290
Edogawa?

352
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,290
Sure.

353
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,290
This is one place that's eerie even in the daytime.

354
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,890
I saw her over there

355
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,990
and as if she wanted me to follow her,

356
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,690
we came to this Water God Shrine.

357
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,890
Then...

358
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,490
Then?

359
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,290
What happened then, Ayumi?

360
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,890
She disappeared.

361
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,090
Disappeared?

362
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,390
Yes. She just disappeared into darkness.

363
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,690
And she never appeared again.

364
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,590
I got tired of calling her

365
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,490
and it seemed I went to sleep at the foot of the tree.

366
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,890
Where did she disappear?

367
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,090
Exactly where?

368
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,890
The mist was thick...

369
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,890
It was there beside the Water God Shrine.

370
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,090
It's still new.

371
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,590
It says "Tamai". It could be the inn across the street.

372
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,090
Oh. That's the story.

373
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,090
This kimono was blown away by the wind.

374
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,190
Ayumi saw it and thought it was the girl by mistake.

375
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,690
What are you talking about, Genta?

376
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,590
Clothes hung out to dry won't come flying this far.

377
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,490
It's not a mistake.

378
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,690
I actually saw her.

379
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,190
I believe you, Ayumi.

380
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,990
It must be some coincidence.

381
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,190
Hey. Are you insisting...

382
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,490
I saw him yesterday...

383
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,390
What is he doing?

384
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,990
Beware of fire.

385
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,390
Beware of fire.

386
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,490
Footsteps?

387
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,390
It's walking!

388
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,690
So it really is a ghost after all!

389
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,990
But a ghost doesn't walk on foot, Genta.

390
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,390
You're right!

391
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,090
Then, it means...

392
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,790
You two stay here!

393
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,790
We'll go with you.

394
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,590
Then, keep quiet.

395
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,790
It's you.

396
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,990
All's well on this floor.

397
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,490
It's on the top floor.

398
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,690
Darn it!

399
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,190
Who is it?

400
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,690
You!

401
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,290
What were you doing?

402
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,390
Mr. Nagakura!

403
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,590
-Call an ambulance. -And the police!

404
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,990
-Yes, I will. -Yes, will do.

405
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,690
The culprit is not far yet.

406
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,090
Ran!

407
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,690
Oh, there...

408
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,590
Mami! So she was real after all.

409
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,890
Where are you going?

410
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,990
It can't be...

411
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,890
A ghost attacked Mr. Nagakura?

412
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,290
"Next Episode" -I see.

413
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,490
If you insist,

414
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,290
I, Kogoro Mouri,

415
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,390
will give my best in this case.

416
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,590
It can't possibly be a ghost.

417
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,590
But...

418
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,890
You saw Mami too, right?

419
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,590
Of course! That explains it!

420
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,990
I'm sure of it.

421
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,990
The real culprit is that person.

422
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,290
The person who will show up at that place tonight.

423
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,990
Next Conan,

424
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,790
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 2)"

425
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:24,717
Two, three!

426
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:26,517
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,817
"Loupe"

428
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:28,817
The next episode is the solution.

429
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,017
Well, who is he?

430
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,117
Is he the big man?

431
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:32,517
The big man?
