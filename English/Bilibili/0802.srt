1
00:00:01.224 --> 00:00:04.624
Ran, Pops and I who came to Tottori

2
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:06.924
encounter a robbery case.

3
00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:11.424
The bride of a famed local family called Kumado is attacked,

4
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:15.324
and the incense burner that is an heirloom, is stolen.

5
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:17.724
The housekeeper of the family

6
00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:20.224
named Naomi Senda is at first suspected,

7
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.824
but she turns out to have an alibi and is found innocent.

8
00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:26.624
Pops deduces that someone among the family is the perp.

9
00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:30.324
However, for some reason, the stolen incense burner is returned.

10
00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:34.724
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

11
00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:36.824
Love and cases come from the same origin.

12
00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:38.924
A robbery with too many mysteries.

13
00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:41.324
Who is the culprit standing on the sand dunes?

14
00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:42.924
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:44.724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:46.724
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:36.563
"Tottori Sand Dunes Mystery Tour (Tottori Edition)"

18
00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:41.363
The darn perp's given himself away.

19
00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:45.063
The perp must've naturally assumed that the police would

20
00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:48.163
keep a sharp eye out if something was actually stolen.

21
00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:50.863
However, the perp was confident that the blackmail would succeed

22
00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:52.563
so the incense burner was stolen.

23
00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:56.063
But something that perp didn't expect happened.

24
00:02:56.063 --> 00:03:00.963
The great and famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri made his appearance.

25
00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:02.363
Huh?

26
00:03:02.363 --> 00:03:04.963
So, the perp gives in thinking he is no match for me.

27
00:03:04.963 --> 00:03:09.363
Not wanting to be exposed of having the heirloom,

28
00:03:09.363 --> 00:03:11.463
the perp hurriedly returns it!

29
00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:15.363
And the only people who know of my involvement here

30
00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:18.063
are the members of the Kumado family.

31
00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:21.563
Therefore, the perp is among one of you here!

32
00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.763
Scared of the detective and returned it, Sis?

33
00:03:31.763 --> 00:03:34.663
"Makie Kumado (35)" -I'll bet it was you?

34
00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:36.363
Or was it you, Soichi?

35
00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:37.463
"Soichi Kumado (32), oldest son"

36
00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:39.263
Like I said, it's not me.

37
00:03:39.263 --> 00:03:41.163
"Iwao Kumado (68), head of the household" -Cut it out!

38
00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:44.063
Well... Now that this has been returned,

39
00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:46.563
who cares who the perp is.

40
00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:49.763
Yes.

41
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.363
That won't do,

42
00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:54.063
since this is a robbery, after all.

43
00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:57.763
I wonder why the robber returned the incense burner?

44
00:03:57.763 --> 00:04:00.663
What? Like I just said, the perp gave up.

45
00:04:00.663 --> 00:04:03.463
The perp figured there'd be trouble, so quickly returned it.

46
00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:05.863
Then all the perp had to do was

47
00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.063
get rid of it instead of return it, right?

48
00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:11.063
True, but...

49
00:04:11.063 --> 00:04:13.063
It just goes to show that the perp has a conscience.

50
00:04:17.263 --> 00:04:20.763
How will we determine which one of them, did it?

51
00:04:20.763 --> 00:04:23.063
We'll go by your insider deduction

52
00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:26.063
and do a thorough check on the alibis of the four.

53
00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:30.063
After all, Ran and I could only get so far investigating.

54
00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:32.363
The one without an alibi is the perp.

55
00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.063
It'll only be a matter of time.

56
00:04:35.063 --> 00:04:38.563
I guess I'll leave that to Pops and the others.

57
00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:41.463
While I go check on the other person.

58
00:04:41.463 --> 00:04:45.463
I wonder if there's anyone who knows a lot about Ms. Naomi Senda?

59
00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:48.963
What?

60
00:04:48.963 --> 00:04:50.963
There's sure something fishy about her, too.

61
00:04:50.963 --> 00:04:54.063
Who knows about Naomi's acquaintances and such.

62
00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:57.263
I think her family's long gone, too.

63
00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.563
I think she mentioned having an Uncle?

64
00:04:59.563 --> 00:05:03.163
What? She did?

65
00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:06.763
I think he worked as an employee at Pear Paradise.

66
00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:13.263
"Pear Paradise"

67
00:05:13.663 --> 00:05:16.863
There's sure something fishy about Ms. Naomi Senda.

68
00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:19.563
Her alibi sounds so made up, too.

69
00:05:19.563 --> 00:05:21.163
That too,

70
00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:25.563
but I wonder why she visited the Kumado's a day before the robbery?

71
00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:28.063
To borrow money, right?

72
00:05:28.063 --> 00:05:29.663
I think it's him.

73
00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:38.163
This gigantic tree is the largest Asian pear tree in Japan.

74
00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:39.163
After all...

75
00:05:39.163 --> 00:05:42.063
"Kozo Adachi (55), Naomi's uncle" -We're okay on that.

76
00:05:42.063 --> 00:05:44.563
You wanted to know about Naomi, right?

77
00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:48.863
I've heard that she had quite a lot o debts.

78
00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:51.163
See, that's why she went to borrow money.

79
00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:54.163
But she couldn't have borrowed the money.

80
00:05:54.163 --> 00:05:55.563
Why should I lend her money?

81
00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.763
That ungrateful swine stole money from this house

82
00:05:57.763 --> 00:05:59.363
when she quit and took off.

83
00:05:59.363 --> 00:06:01.163
I see.

84
00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:04.663
Unless she had some other means of getting what she needed.

85
00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:09.463
Maybe she had a hold of someone's sore spot.

86
00:06:13.863 --> 00:06:15.363
Hello?

87
00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:17.663
Okay. I'll be right over.

88
00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:20.163
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:22.863
Some urgent business seems to have come up.

90
00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:25.463
Something comes to mind, right?

91
00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:29.463
Really? Please tell us about it.

92
00:06:30.663 --> 00:06:32.863
I scolded her not to gossip

93
00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:36.563
about the family that she's working for.

94
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.763
She was rendezvousing with a man.

95
00:06:38.763 --> 00:06:40.663
At the sand dunes, secretly.

96
00:06:40.663 --> 00:06:42.163
She looks so virtuous,

97
00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:45.363
but who knows what goes on behind the scenes.

98
00:06:47.963 --> 00:06:51.263
It happened to years ago, just before she quit.

99
00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:52.463
That idiot!

100
00:06:52.463 --> 00:06:54.563
She called this juicy information or what not's.

101
00:06:56.863 --> 00:06:59.963
Juicy meaning a great content for blackmailing, right?

102
00:06:59.963 --> 00:07:03.363
But I wonder if Shuko's the type to have an affair.

103
00:07:03.363 --> 00:07:05.663
The point is that she secretly went to see a man

104
00:07:05.663 --> 00:07:08.563
and was witnessed doing so.

105
00:07:08.563 --> 00:07:11.463
If Naomi threatened her saying she would tell,

106
00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:14.963
Shuko would have no choice but to pay her to keep her quiet.

107
00:07:14.963 --> 00:07:19.263
But I don't think Shuko has money that she can use freely.

108
00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.463
I get the picture!

109
00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:25.463
That's why Shuko was tied up back then!

110
00:07:25.463 --> 00:07:27.563
What? What do you mean?

111
00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:34.063
All four had alibis?

112
00:07:34.063 --> 00:07:36.463
At around 1:00 when the incident occurred,

113
00:07:36.463 --> 00:07:40.763
the eye-witnesses testified seeing Iwao, head of the household,

114
00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:42.963
the oldest daughter, Makie,

115
00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.063
the oldest son, Soichi

116
00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.163
and Junji as well.

117
00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:49.763
So, all four of them are innocent?

118
00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:56.663
The members in the family are the only ones with the key,

119
00:07:56.663 --> 00:07:59.363
and the ones who could've picked up the pendant

120
00:07:59.363 --> 00:08:03.863
that Naomi Senda dropped the previous day...

121
00:08:03.863 --> 00:08:07.063
Wait a sec. This robbery...

122
00:08:07.063 --> 00:08:08.763
Maybe...

123
00:08:11.863 --> 00:08:13.663
Then, Dad, you too?

124
00:08:13.663 --> 00:08:16.463
Yeah, it seems I've come to the same conclusion as this brat.

125
00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:20.363
But all both of you have now are your deductions.

126
00:08:20.363 --> 00:08:22.863
For now, there's no evidence.

127
00:08:22.863 --> 00:08:24.563
But as to the key of this case,

128
00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:27.363
that the incident occurred at around 1:00,

129
00:08:27.363 --> 00:08:29.863
I think that can be overturned.

130
00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:33.063
The Kumado's...

131
00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:35.463
It was just around 12:00 noon

132
00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.663
when I made my first delivery.

133
00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:43.363
But nobody was home,

134
00:08:43.363 --> 00:08:45.663
so I left a please contact us slip.

135
00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:48.763
Then, got a call for re-delivery,

136
00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:50.763
so I delivered it again later.

137
00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.163
May I go now?

138
00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:54.763
I'm sorry to have bothered you during work.

139
00:08:56.563 --> 00:09:01.263
I was just wondering because Shuko rushed out to get the package.

140
00:09:01.263 --> 00:09:03.063
Yes?

141
00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:04.463
A delivery?

142
00:09:04.463 --> 00:09:05.463
I'll be right out.

143
00:09:05.463 --> 00:09:07.263
No, I'll go.

144
00:09:08.263 --> 00:09:09.763
She probably didn't want somebody else to get it

145
00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:13.263
and find out that it was a re-delivery, right?

146
00:09:13.263 --> 00:09:15.163
Because she was supposed to be home watching the house.

147
00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:16.863
She didn't want anyone to know

148
00:09:16.863 --> 00:09:18.863
that she couldn't get the package at 12:00 noon.

149
00:09:18.863 --> 00:09:21.363
I think that Shuko was at that point...

150
00:09:27.363 --> 00:09:29.563
Already tied up.

151
00:09:31.163 --> 00:09:32.963
So, that's the story.

152
00:09:34.163 --> 00:09:36.163
It all started two years ago.

153
00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:38.263
When Naomi Senda witnessed

154
00:09:38.263 --> 00:09:42.363
Shuko secretly meeting a man at the sand dunes.

155
00:09:42.363 --> 00:09:46.363
Naomi began blackmailing Shuko about this.

156
00:09:46.363 --> 00:09:51.063
I guess Shuko went all out each time to get the money ready.

157
00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:53.063
But this can't go on forever.

158
00:09:53.063 --> 00:09:55.963
So, they both decided to gang up together,

159
00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:58.663
steal the heirloom incense burner and get cash in return for it.

160
00:09:59.763 --> 00:10:01.663
After making sure that all the members of the family had left,

161
00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:04.763
Shuko hid the incense burner somewhere.

162
00:10:04.763 --> 00:10:09.063
Then, she let Naomi Senda into the house from the backdoor.

163
00:10:09.063 --> 00:10:12.963
Made Naomi tie both her hands and legs.

164
00:10:12.963 --> 00:10:15.663
Then, hid the pendant by the sofa.

165
00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:16.963
After that, she cracked the vase,

166
00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:18.463
and determined the time that she was attacked

167
00:10:18.463 --> 00:10:20.463
by the robber to be around 1:00.

168
00:10:20.463 --> 00:10:23.563
Finally, Naomi Senda created her alibi for that time span!

169
00:10:23.563 --> 00:10:27.363
Heck. I wasted my time and money.

170
00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:30.363
It's late. That clock.

171
00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:33.063
I'm sorry, Kazuma.

172
00:10:33.063 --> 00:10:35.363
It'll be over soon.

173
00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:38.763
Waiting for the right time, Shuko called the police.

174
00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.263
She was tied up because she wanted everyone

175
00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:43.763
to believe that a robber broke in, right?

176
00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:46.363
The most important thing about this fake robbery was

177
00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:49.463
that no one found out they were in this together.

178
00:10:49.463 --> 00:10:53.263
So, the pendant was a prop to fight over.

179
00:10:53.263 --> 00:10:55.363
They wanted to make everyone believe

180
00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.863
that they were on bad terms with each other.

181
00:10:57.863 --> 00:11:00.163
They're in the same boat.

182
00:11:00.163 --> 00:11:01.763
They're finished.

183
00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:03.263
But, Pops...

184
00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.063
I wonder why Shuko returned the incense burner?

185
00:11:06.063 --> 00:11:07.163
What?

186
00:11:07.163 --> 00:11:09.963
Like I said, she gave in because I appeared!

187
00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:12.263
I wonder if she'd give up that easily?

188
00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:15.763
She needed the money, right?

189
00:11:15.763 --> 00:11:17.263
Money to keep her quiet.

190
00:11:17.263 --> 00:11:19.463
Moreover, back then...

191
00:11:19.463 --> 00:11:21.763
If you want, I could serve as your bodyguard.

192
00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.163
What?

193
00:11:23.163 --> 00:11:26.063
No, I think she's just harassing me.

194
00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:28.763
If she wanted to emphasize that they were on bad terms...

195
00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:31.363
It would be natural to ask to be protected

196
00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:33.863
because you don't know what your enemy's going to do to you, right?

197
00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:35.463
Stop blabbering!

198
00:11:35.463 --> 00:11:38.263
We'll find out the truth when we strike them with our deductions!

199
00:11:39.263 --> 00:11:41.663
What? She went to meet Naomi Senda?

200
00:11:41.663 --> 00:11:43.663
Yes. Just a while ago.

201
00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:47.163
I just got a call from Naomi saying she wants to see me.

202
00:11:47.163 --> 00:11:50.263
It seems she's still angry about the other day.

203
00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:53.063
So, I'd like to go and apologize to her.

204
00:11:53.063 --> 00:11:57.063
Go. Soichi and I will take care of Kazuma.

205
00:12:00.563 --> 00:12:02.963
Naomi Senda asked her out.

206
00:12:02.963 --> 00:12:05.063
It happened to be good timing, too.

207
00:12:05.063 --> 00:12:06.463
If the incense burner wasn't returned,

208
00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:09.063
Father wouldn't have let her out that easily.

209
00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:10.663
That woman!

210
00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.863
Since things didn't go well this time,

211
00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.963
she's plotting her next scheme!

212
00:12:13.963 --> 00:12:15.363
Oh, no!

213
00:12:15.363 --> 00:12:17.763
But, if so, I don't think Shuko would've

214
00:12:17.763 --> 00:12:19.863
told her family that she'd be meeting Naomi.

215
00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:21.263
Where'd she go?

216
00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:23.663
She said she was going to Uradome Coast.

217
00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:25.463
A coast?

218
00:12:25.463 --> 00:12:26.663
No way!

219
00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:29.463
What about Shuko?

220
00:12:29.463 --> 00:12:32.163
I see! I got it!

221
00:12:32.163 --> 00:12:33.263
Get there in time!

222
00:12:33.263 --> 00:12:35.763
The real incident is about to occur from now!

223
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.430
"Uradome Coast"

224
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.530
"Arasuna Shrine"

225
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.430
Come on, hurry up and give it to me!

226
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.030
Let's go a little farther up.

227
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.030
You're both here together.

228
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.430
Up there there's a very steep cliff, isn't there?

229
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.930
You'd never make it if you fall off!

230
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.030
Let's change places.

231
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.330
And go to the Sand Dunes

232
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.930
where everything began two years ago,

233
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.730
which is also connected to the fake robbery case that occurred!

234
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.430
Fake robbery case?

235
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.230
No use already, Naomi.

236
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.430
I've seen through everything.

237
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.530
It's her!

238
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.130
She's the one that planned it!

239
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.530
Even so, who's the one that cornered her

240
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.130
and drove her to do what she did?

241
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.530
What were you planning to make Shuko do next?

242
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.130
Next?

243
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.030
What were you going to...

244
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.530
Dad.

245
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.630
Just as I thought after all.

246
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.730
Shuko called you telling you that she got a hold of the 10 million yen

247
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.830
and would like to give it to you.

248
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.330
So to come here.

249
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.330
-Right. -What?

250
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:32.230
Shuko is the one who asked Naomi to come to the coast.

251
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.830
So that she could fulfill her real purpose.

252
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.430
So, you knew what I was up to already.

253
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.530
What're you talking about?

254
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.730
What do you mean by her real purpose, Dad?

255
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.130
Two years ago,

256
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.830
why did you secretly meet with a man, Shuko?

257
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.230
That's what caused all this blackmailing stuff, no?

258
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.330
My husband is a very kind person deep inside.

259
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.930
He's also the oldest son of a distinguished family.

260
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.830
He fell in love with me at first sight.

261
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.030
Our marriage went through and my parents were delighted.

262
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.530
But as soon as I entered the family,

263
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.530
I realized that I had made a mistake.

264
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.030
I even considered divorce,

265
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.030
but when I thought about my parents, I couldn't.

266
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.930
One day, Mr. Kotani who was my classmate

267
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.630
in intermediate school gave me a call.

268
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.730
You mean that doctor?

269
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.630
He died at the beginning of this month in South Africa.

270
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.230
I've decided to go to South Africa.

271
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.330
Just like you've been saying from before!

272
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.130
I want you to come with me.

273
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.030
What?

274
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.930
I know.

275
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.230
The circumstances you're undergoing now.

276
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.730
I've never stopped thinking about you, you see.

277
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.730
If you told me a bit earlier, I may have thought about it.

278
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.930
I'm pregnant.

279
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.730
When I found out I was pregnant,

280
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:09.030
I made up my mind to dream only of my child's future.

281
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.830
I decided to forget and drop everything else.

282
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.330
I see.

283
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.230
I'll be praying from miles away

284
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.130
that a good child will be born then.

285
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.530
Thank you.

286
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.130
Take care of yourself too, Mr. Kotani.

287
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.730
He's a nice man, isn't he? Mrs. Kumado.

288
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.930
You'd be kicked out of the house

289
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.630
if I show this to them, wouldn't you?

290
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.130
But you're pregnant with a boy, so...

291
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.630
I know that father would do whatever it takes

292
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.230
to take the child away from me.

293
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.930
So, the blackmailing started

294
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.230
when Naomi started taking advantage of your feelings

295
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.830
of not wanting to be torn apart from your son.

296
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.230
However, you can only go so far

297
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.830
as to preparing money each time.

298
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.530
Besides, hush money was

299
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.730
only a temporary solution in the first place.

300
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.230
Therefore, you wanted to shut her up eternally.

301
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.230
Shuko's real purpose was to...

302
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.230
No, it can't be.

303
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.630
You mean... You were thinking of killing me.

304
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.630
I thought I had no other choice.

305
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.830
But there must've been a trigger

306
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.230
that drove you to make up your mind.

307
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.130
I think it was when you saw the news on Mr. Kotani's death.

308
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.430
Dr. Kotani, who unfortunately got involved in an accident,

309
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.930
was carrying out medical activities there...

310
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.430
Kotani... You mean that guy back then

311
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.530
was a doctor?

312
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.830
When his identity became known,

313
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.830
I was overtaken by fear of being trapped.

314
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.130
So, you made up your mind to kill her.

315
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.430
And in order to not get caught after killing her,

316
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.330
you thought up the fake robbery.

317
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.630
What's it about?

318
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.830
I got Naomi into this.

319
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.230
I told her that we'd steal the heirloom incense burner

320
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.930
and blackmail Kumado for a large sum of money.

321
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.130
And that I'd give her all of it,

322
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.530
so let's end this deal once and for all.

323
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.430
She told me that even if the police kept guard over the house,

324
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.230
as long as we could get him to prepare the cash,

325
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.930
she would sneak in at night and steal the cash.

326
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.930
You believed her story,

327
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.530
came back to Tottori

328
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.230
where the fake robbery was carried out.

329
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.230
Just as planned.

330
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.130
How dare you lie like that?

331
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.330
-I tell you, stop lying! -Stop it!

332
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.230
I'll pay you back for all of this,

333
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.730
so just you wait and see.

334
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:39.230
I... I'm going to be killed by her.

335
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.930
You thought that it was a sham

336
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.830
to make it look as though you two didn't get along.

337
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.130
That's what we talked over.

338
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.330
You've got it all wrong.

339
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.230
The person that Shuko was after

340
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.230
was the one she called to come to the coast

341
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.530
so that she could hand the money over.

342
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.730
Come on, hurry up and give it to me! The money!

343
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.530
After fulfilling her purpose, Shuko was going to...

344
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.130
No matter how much I apologized about the other day,

345
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.730
Naomi refused to forgive me.

346
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.430
Then, she tried to push me off from here.

347
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.130
I desperately fought back to protect myself.

348
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.730
And by the time, I realized it...

349
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.030
You did mention that she may come after you and kill you.

350
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.030
I wouldn't be surprised if that violent woman did.

351
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.530
Self-defense would be applied to a case like this.

352
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.330
You're not guilty of anything!

353
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.030
We, the police more than anyone else can see that.

354
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.530
After killing Naomi,

355
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.430
you were going to try to get away with it

356
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.830
by saying that you did so in self-defense.

357
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.630
The fake robbery that was committed was

358
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.330
set up just to carry this out.

359
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.030
Which means I was called to come to Tottori

360
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.830
for the sole sake of being killed?

361
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.830
However, in order to go through with this scheme,

362
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.430
she would have to make it out here alone.

363
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.130
But under the highly strained circumstance

364
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.930
of the incense burner being stolen,

365
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.930
the head of the household would never let her out.

366
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.330
Therefore, you returned the incense burner.

367
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.130
And you refused being watched by a bodyguard.

368
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.230
Because if a detective is stuck to you,

369
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.830
you won't be able to move about freely.

370
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.930
But everything I did was in vain.

371
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.530
Because Mr. Mouri saw through it all.

372
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.730
But, Dad...

373
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.930
Yeah, attempted murder cannot be applied here.

374
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.630
But this woman actually tried to kill me!

375
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.130
But she didn't, did she?

376
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.030
She just schemed it, but didn't lay a finger on you!

377
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.530
No...

378
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.130
But the result is the same.

379
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:46.130
What?

380
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.130
The fake robbery cannot be erased.

381
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:55.730
I'm guilty of the crime of stealing the precious heirloom,

382
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.930
I'm going to be kicked out of the Kumado family.

383
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.730
I'll be torn apart from Kazuma!

384
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.230
No way.

385
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.130
There's nothing a detective can do

386
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.730
when it comes to the affairs of families other than my own.

387
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.230
You've got me!

388
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.030
I'll cut ties with the family.

389
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.330
My kid brother Junji can inherit the estate.

390
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.030
You, Kazuma and I...

391
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.930
We can start a new family together!

392
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.330
Dear.

393
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.030
I'll bet you didn't know,

394
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:35.530
but I really love you, Shuko.

395
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.130
-Stop pushing me! -Okay.

396
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.430
Shuko.

397
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.430
I'll wait for you.

398
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.730
Together with Kazuma.

399
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.330
Thank you.

400
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.130
I'm happy for them.

401
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.330
Mr. Mouri.

402
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.430
You're my pride and joy, after all.

403
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.430
Dad! Did you hear what he just said?

404
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.830
I don't think he can.

405
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.030
Crab, I want to eat crab...

406
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.130
On the other side of that, if I remember correctly...

407
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.330
The sea. Right?

408
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.230
-Pops! -Dad!

409
00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.430
"Next Episode" -What's that?

410
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.030
No joke?

411
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.030
Are you sure about that, Genta?

412
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.430
I'm sure.

413
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.730
Whenever I go to by Eel's over rice lunch,

414
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.730
he always buying the large size Nori Bento.

415
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.530
It's him! Him!

416
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.930
Hey, do you want to eat eels?

417
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:11.730
Arsonist?

418
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.030
Who is this?

419
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.530
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

420
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:21.930
Next Conan, "Pitfall of Fire Prevention"

421
00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:24.473
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:24.473 --> 00:24:27.373
"Children's Park"

423
00:24:27.373 --> 00:24:29.073
-Dad! -Fire!

424
00:24:29.073 --> 00:24:31.773
Beware of pitfalls!
