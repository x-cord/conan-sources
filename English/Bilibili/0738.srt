1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,740
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,540
Right, my business is looking for the faults of others.

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,340
In order to console a heart that is battered by such a job,

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,140
most detectives have their own secret pub that they frequent.

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,440
Awesome!

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,240
This shop where the youths noisily play pool and darts

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,540
is unfortunately not my kind of pub,

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,840
but the bartender here being my client,

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,540
I've got no choice.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,140
Here you go, Mr. Detective!

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,440
Drink this for the time being.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,040
Her name is Yuzuki Fukui, age 26.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,440
The bartender for this shop.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,140
I'm sure she likes me.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,540
As proof of that,

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,740
she's treating me to this light green cocktail, Gimlet.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm sure she sees me as

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,740
a double of that detective, Phillip Marlowe.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,040
This is green tea?

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,140
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,340
I figured you wouldn't be able to work if you got drunk, you see.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,840
Well, it's okay.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Let me start over again.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,540
This is a pool bar where my client

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
who is a bartender here is working.

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,340
The thing that relaxes my heart is

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,640
the off-beat jazz music playing in this shop and...

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,240
Hey, Pops.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
The voice of a brat.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Huh? Why're you here?

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Because Ran told me to come and get you

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
before dinner gets cold!

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,340
I told you I'm here on business!

35
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
So you say,

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,640
but she said that all you're probably doing is drinking.

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,140
I'm here on business, right? It's a difficult case!

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,540
Yes, sort of.

39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,540
-See, like I told you! -What kind of case is it?

40
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,140
I hear strange sounds when I'm working.

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,240
A popping sound like that of the cork of a champagne bottle

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,440
when it's opened.

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,440
A sound like when the cork of a champagne bottle is removed?

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,840
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,740
are slashed by the light of deduction.

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Pool Bar Blue Parrot Liquor summons the case.

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,940
His name is Detective Conan!

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,820
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 1)"

51
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,120
See, just like that sound.

52
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,220
Maybe it was just

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,120
the sound of the cork of a champagne bottle being removed?

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,220
But back then,

55
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,320
I didn't serve champagne to any of the customers.

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Maybe a customer snuck a bottle in?

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,420
Wine bottles also have corks.

58
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,220
I thought so too,

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,520
so I watched the customers closely.

60
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
But there were no customers

61
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
drinking champagne or wine at that time.

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,620
After I heard that sound,

63
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
I also heard the sound of something falling.

64
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,220
I looked for it after closing when I was cleaning the shop,

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,420
but found no corks.

66
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,120
Only... I smelled something strange.

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,520
A strange smell?

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,620
Don't tell me it was the smell of something that explodes,

69
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,120
like gun powder?

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,020
No. It smelled like yuzu.

71
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Although it was very slight,

72
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,820
since the kanji character "yuzu" is in my name,

73
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
I've always been sensitive to the smell.

74
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,220
Since we don't use yuzu in this shop,

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,820
I thought it was strange

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,420
and decided to discuss it with you, Mr. Mouri.

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,720
Maybe a customer spilled a citrus drink that smelled similar?

78
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,520
You know, like the gimlet that uses lime juice.

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,720
The screw driver and white lady, likewise.

80
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,720
I thought it was the smell of yuzu, though.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,120
Did you hear that sound several times?

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Yes. 2 or 3 times on different days.

83
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,620
Are there any customers here today

84
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,020
that have been here every time you heard that sound?

85
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,720
Yes! They're the ones at the table right behind us.

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,220
That foursome!

87
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,420
Then, here goes.

88
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,320
Okay, cheese!

89
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,720
Department head, I've run out of film.

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,620
Don't worry, no problem.

91
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,720
I've got two or three spare films myself, too.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,220
I had a lot of spares bought for me.

93
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,620
Right?

94
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,020
Yes.

95
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,220
-Mr. Kogure, here. -Okay.

96
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,420
But, isn't it a hassle using analog cameras in this day and age?

97
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,220
I hate digitals!

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,920
Remember...

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,020
there was one guy in our department too, wasn't there?

100
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,520
The one that used to say, "I'm at home with digitals",

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,720
that geek, who was no good at work.

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,820
You mean Mr. Yoshikuwa?

103
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes, Yoshikuwa.

104
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,520
If you get totally hooked on digitals like him,

105
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
you'll soon lose track of what's real and what's not.

106
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,320
And end up being cooped up,

107
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,920
then eventually hang yourself to death!

108
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,720
Come to think of it, it seems that

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
you were getting it on with that guy, Ms. Kishiura.

110
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
But if you're lonely with no boyfriend,

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,920
you can count on me to give you a good time, you know?

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,420
No, I don't think so.

113
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,120
Come on, don't be that way.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,220
It's between you and me...

115
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,120
Yes, Mr. Usuda!

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,020
What is it, Hatsumura?

117
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,820
I got you the billiard cue that you asked me to get for you.

118
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,320
I found a super high grade ebony base model

119
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
for a super low price, you see.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Is that right? Thanks, Hatsumura.

121
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
It's a fantastic gift.

122
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
A gift?

123
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,720
It's my birthday present, isn't it?

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
Yes.

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,620
I bought you something, too! Your own darts, Mr. Usuda.

126
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,420
Although there were a lot of soft plastic darts around,

127
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,920
these hard steel darts were really tough to find.

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
I see. Is that right?

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,820
You guys are really efficient, after all!

130
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,620
Of course, I meant to give it as a gift to you, Mr. Usuda!

131
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,020
Kogure, do you know why I wanted the steel darts?

132
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,520
No.

133
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,620
It's because...

134
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,420
I can't make you panic with plastic darts,

135
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,720
like I'm doing now. Can I?

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,520
It seems the pool table's open now!

137
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,620
Since you went out of your way to get the cue for me,

138
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,720
I guess I may as well try it out!

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,120
Anyway! Go on home and tell Ran,

140
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,520
that Pops Kogoro got a request to solve a difficult case,

141
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,220
and won't be home for a while.

142
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,020
So, Yuzuki my dear,

143
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,020
won't you please make me a Gimlet?

144
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,320
What? Are you sure you can do your job drinking?

145
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,920
I'll be fine, fine.

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,620
Don't blame me for what may happen later.

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
Pops! Let's go home, already!

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Ran was really pissed, you know!

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,420
Come on, shut up!

150
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,020
Coming back time and again.

151
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,820
Can't you see that I'm working?

152
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,920
All you're doing is drinking!

153
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Yuzuki my dear, another Gimlet, please!

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,520
Please think it out like you should now!

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,920
Once this mystery is solved,

156
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,620
I'm planning to upload it on my blog, you see.

157
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,820
Don't you worry, because the mystery is almost solved.

158
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,320
Is that so?

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,020
No joke?

160
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,620
The perp probably spilled some lime-vinegar.

161
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,320
Moreover, the kind with yuzu in it.

162
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,420
Yuzu lime vinegar?

163
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,820
Hey.

164
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,720
In other words, that is...

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,620
That is?

166
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,520
That is yuzu and lime.

167
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Yuzu and lime! Like so.

168
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,220
-It's got the pop and all, see! -He's wasted.

169
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,320
So, Mr. Usuda's fallen asleep.

170
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
Yes, he's a weak drinker and yet he wants to drink.

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,820
Talk about bummers,

172
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,620
that billiard cue cost 100,000 yen.

173
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,520
The darts, case and all that I got for him

174
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,020
cost me 60,000 yen too.

175
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,920
You're lucky, Kishiura,

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,220
that you only had to buy him 5 to 6 cases of film, right?

177
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,920
I told you, didn't I?

178
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,220
That he asked me to buy him the poster of an idol

179
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,020
through internet auction for his birthday.

180
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,720
Come to think of it, you were giving it to him at the company.

181
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,320
It cost me 30,000 yen, autograph and all, you know!

182
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,620
May I take a look at it?

183
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,220
Don't get it dirty, you know,

184
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,320
'cuz Mr. Usuda's going to get at me if you do.

185
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,220
I know!

186
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
Yoko Okino.

187
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,620
Okay then, shall we have another drink before leaving?

188
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,220
I guess so.

189
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,120
All you've been doing is making the drinks,

190
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
so you haven't been able to drink much, have you?

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,020
Come to think of it,

192
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,620
I feel like all I've been doing was crushing ice with this.

193
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,620
Then how about another one of the first champagne that we drank?

194
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,120
Yes! That was good.

195
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,620
-What do you say? -Fine with me.

196
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,820
Excuse me! A bottle of champagne, please!

197
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,720
-Right away! -And three glasses, too!

198
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,620
That person at the counter, isn't he Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,320
No joke! You mean that renown detective?

200
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
I somehow feel like I'm being watched.

201
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,620
I want to take a picture of him!

202
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,420
Maybe he's just a look alike?

203
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,320
I guess so. I don't think he'd be such a drunkard.

204
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,020
I'm not at home with things like this after all.

205
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,920
Hey, hey! Don't face it towards me!

206
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,120
Mr. Kogure, please.

207
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,720
When it comes to jobs requiring strength, you can count on Kogure!

208
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,820
Yes, yes. Please leave it to me.

209
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
What's with this? It's really tight.

210
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Hey! Don't face it this way, you know!

211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
I know.

212
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,020
-It's bursting out! -Stupid!

213
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,420
It's splashing on the poster!

214
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,520
I really heard that sound.

215
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,120
That was champagne just now, wasn't it?

216
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,220
The edge of the poster got wet!

217
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,720
Shoots!

218
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,120
Excuse me, please bring us three hot towels!

219
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,420
Yes!

220
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,920
How about the sound of the package of the hot towels being opened?

221
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,120
Is it different from the sound you heard?

222
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,520
The sound of the cork being removed

223
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
sounds closer to what I heard after all.

224
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,420
Hey! Some have flown onto Mr. Usuda, too.

225
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
What? Shoots!

226
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,720
What's that?

227
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,920
There's something that looks like a red dot on Mr. Usuda's neck.

228
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,420
True.

229
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Rather, he's not breathing.

230
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,220
Don't tell me...

231
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,920
Mr. Usuda...

232
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,920
Mr. Usuda!

233
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,720
Are you all right?

234
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,820
Hey, what's up?

235
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,420
Mr. Usuda's not moving as if he's dead!

236
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,320
What?

237
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,320
It's not as if he's dead,

238
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,920
he's really dead.

239
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:48,413
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

240
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,713
I got a job request from a woman bartender

241
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:52,813
called Yuzuki Fukui, who's in love with me,

242
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:56,413
and came to the pool bar where she works.

243
00:13:56,413 --> 00:14:00,413
But the one that refuses to let go of me, wasn't her.

244
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:03,313
But rather, the case.

245
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:07,313
Unless we do any autopsy, we can't tell for sure

246
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,813
but the cause of death is most likely, suffocation

247
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,013
due to nerve poisoning.

248
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:12,813
Poisoning?

249
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:16,413
Yes, from this wound behind his neck.

250
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:17,613
It seems that a sharp object

251
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:20,613
such as an eyeleteer laced with poison, was poked in.

252
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:23,113
But, if he was poked with such a thing,

253
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,713
he would've shouted or made a scene I'm sure.

254
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:28,613
I think he died falling asleep.

255
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:32,713
-What? -Because the victim seemed wasted.

256
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,813
Well, so it's you again?

257
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:37,113
Yes, sir, Mr. Inspector!

258
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:41,113
Don't tell me that you coincidentally happened to be here again?

259
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,913
Yes. It is indeed that coincidence again.

260
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,913
Yes, detectives have the duty of confidentiality.

261
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,313
No matter what the circumstances,

262
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:51,613
we may not talk about the client to others.

263
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:55,013
In order to prevent Yuzuki from being suspected,

264
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,413
I'll have to keep my mouth shut as to her job request to me.

265
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,313
And for the sake of the pride of being a detective, too.

266
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:01,313
I'm the one that asked him to come here!

267
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:02,913
What?

268
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,513
Because I had a mystery that I wanted Mr. Mouri to solve for me.

269
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:09,613
-A mystery? -I hear this popping sound during work

270
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:12,313
like the sound of the cork of a champagne bottle being removed.

271
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:15,313
-What? -Of course at that time,

272
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,013
no champagne is being served to any customers.

273
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:19,813
Even when I clean the shop after closing time,

274
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:23,113
no cork of any kind has been found.

275
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:26,313
However, I smell the fragrance of yuzu.

276
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:29,513
By the way, how much are you getting paid for this request?

277
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:30,613
She said that she's going to drop all the charges

278
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,613
for all the drinks I drank here so far.

279
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,313
Of course, you're going to have to pay for

280
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:37,013
the Gimlet that I served tonight though.

281
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:39,113
What? I do?

282
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:43,213
So, they're the three

283
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,813
who were drinking with the victim? Is that correct?

284
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:47,113
Yes, sir.

285
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,813
I asked them several questions before you got here, Inspector.

286
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:53,713
Starting from the person to your right.

287
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:56,713
She's Ms. Mika Kishiura, age 30.

288
00:15:56,713 --> 00:15:59,913
He's Mr. Kensaku Hatsumura, age 31.

289
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:03,613
And, he's Mr. Monpei Kogure, age 28.

290
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,113
They all work at the same company

291
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:07,813
along with the victim, Mr. Usuda who is their department head.

292
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:13,213
And they were all here tonight to celebrate his birthday.

293
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:18,313
Which means that one of three here,

294
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:20,313
had a grudge against the department head

295
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,613
and poisoned him to death.

296
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:24,713
Hey, hold it, will you?

297
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:28,013
We were all just celebrating his birthday.

298
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,613
We didn't poison him to death!

299
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,313
Didn't you three do it?

300
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:37,513
You guys were shooting glances at me, a detective, and whispering.

301
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:41,813
We were saying that you look just like the "Sleeping Kogoro!"

302
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,813
We had no idea that you were the man himself.

303
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:47,113
Besides, we've got no motive to kill him.

304
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:50,913
But you guys were all talking among yourselves

305
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:53,013
after the department head got wasted, right?

306
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,513
Saying things like he forced you

307
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,013
to buy super expensive birthday gifts,

308
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,213
so you were pissed.

309
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:01,513
You were listening, sonny?

310
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:03,813
Yes! Because I got good ears!

311
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,513
Moreover, you also mentioned that a person called Yoshikuwa

312
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:09,313
that the department head despised committed suicide.

313
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:14,613
And that the man called Yoshikuwa was going with you too, miss!

314
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,513
Is that true?

315
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:18,313
Yes. It's true.

316
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:22,413
Not only that, Mr. Hatsumura here was his senior in university,

317
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,913
and Mr. Kogure entered the company at the same time he did!

318
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:28,213
Besides, we'd never play billiards and darts

319
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,113
with somebody we hate so much as to want to kill him!

320
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:32,913
You were playing games with the victim?

321
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:35,813
Yes, until the department head got wasted,

322
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:38,813
we were taking turns being his game partner.

323
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:43,013
Was the department head really playing with those three people?

324
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:46,313
That's right! You kept going home each time,

325
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:47,813
so you didn't see what happened, did you?

326
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,413
That department head really was a problem, you see.

327
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:53,413
The dart board here is only for soft darts,

328
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,813
but he tried to use the steel darts

329
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:56,213
that were given to him as a birthday present

330
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:59,213
and got into trouble with the other customers.

331
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,713
Those three people went over to stop the fight

332
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,813
and managed to cool everyone off.

333
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,813
It seemed they decided to let him rest at the table

334
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,213
and wait for him to get sober.

335
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,013
And, what about after that?

336
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:13,713
Three of them were playing billiards and darts for a while.

337
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:16,613
They seemed to be switching partner each time one person lost.

338
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:20,013
Which means that when two of the three were playing,

339
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,113
each person had the chance

340
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:24,413
to spend time with the department head alone, right?

341
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,013
In other words, each of you three people had the chance

342
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:31,813
to be alone with the department head, just the two of you.

343
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,813
Okay, we're going to have to do a body check on you,

344
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,713
as well as check your belongings.

345
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,113
A billiard cue.

346
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,313
It sure does look expensive!

347
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:48,913
Yes. It cost 160,000 yen but was selling for 100,000 yen

348
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:50,313
so I decided to get it for the department head.

349
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:53,513
And, just as this boy mentioned.

350
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:57,213
I didn't intend to buy him such an expensive gift,

351
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:59,513
so I was a bit annoyed.

352
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,513
Do you think I'd kill somebody for a reason like that?

353
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:07,113
But if you were to attach a poisoned needle on the tip of the cue,

354
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,913
even if you were away from the table,

355
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:11,413
you could probably have poked him with it?

356
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:13,913
What? If I did something so obvious,

357
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:15,913
somebody would've remembered it!

358
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:18,313
I didn't do anything of that sort, did I?

359
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:19,613
No.

360
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:21,313
As soon as the department got wasted,

361
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:24,813
he hastily put the cue back into the case.

362
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,913
I see. So, these darts

363
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:31,413
were what caused the fight with the customers.

364
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,813
I didn't deliberately buy it to cause the fight, you know!

365
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:38,613
I only bought it because the department head told me to buy it for him.

366
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:42,413
I received a vintage dart board that was a keepsake of my grandfather,

367
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:43,913
so I gave it to the department head.

368
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:45,913
Then, he told me to go and buy him darts to go with it, too.

369
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:49,113
I don't play darts at all, you see.

370
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:50,113
Come to think of it,

371
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:52,313
when the department head pretended to throw the dart at you,

372
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,213
you were really panicked, weren't you?

373
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:59,913
Yes. I really panicked back then.

374
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:03,413
I'll bet you laced poison to the tip of the dart

375
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,213
and threw it from a distance poking it into him?

376
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:08,613
Didn't I just tell you? That I'm not good at darts.

377
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,813
Besides, if I were going to throw it from a distance,

378
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:13,613
it would be easier for me to poke it into him at point blank range!

379
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,213
-Well, I guess so. -If you insist on suspecting me,

380
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:20,113
why don't you go ahead and scrutinize the darts?

381
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:22,613
Of course we will.

382
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:26,713
You got him several boxes of film

383
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:29,013
and a poster of an idol.

384
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:32,213
Compared to the other two, your gifts are way cheaper.

385
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:36,713
Hey! That poster cost me 30,000 yen autograph and all, you know.

386
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,813
Well, I couldn't help but get it for him

387
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:41,213
because he was sitting near my desk

388
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:44,213
and persistently repeating that he wanted it.

389
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:49,013
The wet part of the poster, it smells like...

390
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:52,313
This fragrance is the smell of yuzu?

391
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,413
This is...

392
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,813
Pops realized it, too!

393
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,913
It's Yoko's poster!

394
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:02,213
Moreover, it's the super rare western bikini shot!

395
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:03,413
Is that what he noticed?

396
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,513
I mean, don't wet it!

397
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,513
I mean the beauty's all wet!

398
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:09,113
And he's making bad jokes, too.

399
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:11,513
The champagne splashed on it

400
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:14,013
when Mr. Kogure tried to pull the cork out.

401
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:18,313
By the way, you seemed to have taken quite a lot of pictures.

402
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,913
Did the department head like pictures?

403
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,413
Yes. They're pictures to be uploaded on his blog!

404
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:27,613
But we're actually the ones

405
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:29,013
who choose the pictures and upload them.

406
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:31,513
The department head's not at home with digitals, you see.

407
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:35,013
Despite that, he likes to put on airs and upload blogs.

408
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:37,113
Well, I'm glad that we don't have

409
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:40,613
to choose pictures for him anymore from now on.

410
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:45,413
Well, something like that would never lead to murder, though.

411
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:49,313
By the way, who was making the whiskey and water drinks?

412
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:52,813
I was the one making most of it.

413
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,913
Then, we'll have to check this too.

414
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:58,513
Because ice picks like the needle of darts

415
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:00,013
are sharp objects that can be used to kill someone.

416
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:03,113
They are very similar in shape to the murder weapon.

417
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:12,713
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

418
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:16,013
It seems that my saga of being a detective

419
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:18,613
has brought upon disaster to this pool bar

420
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:22,313
that was supposed to be my haven of comfort.

421
00:22:22,313 --> 00:22:24,013
Well, well...

422
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:28,813
It seems that this case won't let me sleep again tonight.

423
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,813
"Next Episode" -There was no trace of poison being laced?

424
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:58,913
What's going on? No murder weapon.

425
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:01,913
It's the same as the pick-pocket case the other day.

426
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:06,413
This is...

427
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:10,013
Why would clay be stuck on the bottom of something like that?

428
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:14,113
So, the perp was the customer who had it out with the victim.

429
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:16,013
Don't tell me...

430
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:21,413
Next Conan, "Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 2)"

431
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:39,613
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,613
"Clay"

433
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,113
There's no clay in a bar only play.

434
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:44,413
Are you drunk, Mr. Mouri?

435
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:46,713
Pops, stay in the bar.
