1
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.740
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

2
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.540
Right, my business is looking for the faults of others.

3
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.340
In order to console a heart that is battered by such a job,

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.140
most detectives have their own secret pub that they frequent.

5
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.440
Awesome!

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.240
This shop where the youths noisily play pool and darts

7
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.540
is unfortunately not my kind of pub,

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.840
but the bartender here being my client,

9
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.540
I've got no choice.

10
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.140
Here you go, Mr. Detective!

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.440
Drink this for the time being.

12
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.040
Her name is Yuzuki Fukui, age 26.

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.440
The bartender for this shop.

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.140
I'm sure she likes me.

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.540
As proof of that,

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.740
she's treating me to this light green cocktail, Gimlet.

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.540
I'm sure she sees me as

18
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.740
a double of that detective, Phillip Marlowe.

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.040
This is green tea?

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.140
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.340
I figured you wouldn't be able to work if you got drunk, you see.

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.840
Well, it's okay.

23
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.040
Let me start over again.

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.440
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

25
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.540
This is a pool bar where my client

26
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.540
who is a bartender here is working.

27
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.340
The thing that relaxes my heart is

28
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.640
the off-beat jazz music playing in this shop and...

29
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.240
Hey, Pops.

30
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240
The voice of a brat.

31
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Huh? Why're you here?

32
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.040
Because Ran told me to come and get you

33
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.840
before dinner gets cold!

34
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.340
I told you I'm here on business!

35
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
So you say,

36
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.640
but she said that all you're probably doing is drinking.

37
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.140
I'm here on business, right? It's a difficult case!

38
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.540
Yes, sort of.

39
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.540
-See, like I told you! -What kind of case is it?

40
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.140
I hear strange sounds when I'm working.

41
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.240
A popping sound like that of the cork of a champagne bottle

42
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.440
when it's opened.

43
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.440
A sound like when the cork of a champagne bottle is removed?

44
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.840
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

45
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.740
are slashed by the light of deduction.

46
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.740
Pool Bar Blue Parrot Liquor summons the case.

47
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.940
His name is Detective Conan!

50
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.820
"Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 1)"

51
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.120
See, just like that sound.

52
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.220
Maybe it was just

53
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.120
the sound of the cork of a champagne bottle being removed?

54
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.220
But back then,

55
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.320
I didn't serve champagne to any of the customers.

56
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.120
Maybe a customer snuck a bottle in?

57
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.420
Wine bottles also have corks.

58
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.220
I thought so too,

59
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.520
so I watched the customers closely.

60
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.120
But there were no customers

61
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.120
drinking champagne or wine at that time.

62
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.620
After I heard that sound,

63
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
I also heard the sound of something falling.

64
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.220
I looked for it after closing when I was cleaning the shop,

65
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.420
but found no corks.

66
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.120
Only... I smelled something strange.

67
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.520
A strange smell?

68
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.620
Don't tell me it was the smell of something that explodes,

69
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.120
like gun powder?

70
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.020
No. It smelled like yuzu.

71
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.020
Although it was very slight,

72
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.820
since the kanji character "yuzu" is in my name,

73
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.820
I've always been sensitive to the smell.

74
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.220
Since we don't use yuzu in this shop,

75
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.820
I thought it was strange

76
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.420
and decided to discuss it with you, Mr. Mouri.

77
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.720
Maybe a customer spilled a citrus drink that smelled similar?

78
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.520
You know, like the gimlet that uses lime juice.

79
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.720
The screw driver and white lady, likewise.

80
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.720
I thought it was the smell of yuzu, though.

81
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.120
Did you hear that sound several times?

82
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.120
Yes. 2 or 3 times on different days.

83
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.620
Are there any customers here today

84
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.020
that have been here every time you heard that sound?

85
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.720
Yes! They're the ones at the table right behind us.

86
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.220
That foursome!

87
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.420
Then, here goes.

88
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.320
Okay, cheese!

89
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.720
Department head, I've run out of film.

90
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.620
Don't worry, no problem.

91
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.720
I've got two or three spare films myself, too.

92
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.220
I had a lot of spares bought for me.

93
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.620
Right?

94
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.020
Yes.

95
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.220
-Mr. Kogure, here. -Okay.

96
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.420
But, isn't it a hassle using analog cameras in this day and age?

97
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.220
I hate digitals!

98
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.920
Remember...

99
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.020
there was one guy in our department too, wasn't there?

100
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.520
The one that used to say, "I'm at home with digitals",

101
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.720
that geek, who was no good at work.

102
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.820
You mean Mr. Yoshikuwa?

103
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.820
Yes, Yoshikuwa.

104
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.520
If you get totally hooked on digitals like him,

105
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.520
you'll soon lose track of what's real and what's not.

106
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.320
And end up being cooped up,

107
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.920
then eventually hang yourself to death!

108
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.720
Come to think of it, it seems that

109
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.720
you were getting it on with that guy, Ms. Kishiura.

110
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
But if you're lonely with no boyfriend,

111
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.920
you can count on me to give you a good time, you know?

112
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.420
No, I don't think so.

113
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.120
Come on, don't be that way.

114
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.220
It's between you and me...

115
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.120
Yes, Mr. Usuda!

116
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.020
What is it, Hatsumura?

117
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.820
I got you the billiard cue that you asked me to get for you.

118
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.320
I found a super high grade ebony base model

119
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.320
for a super low price, you see.

120
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.120
Is that right? Thanks, Hatsumura.

121
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.720
It's a fantastic gift.

122
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.720
A gift?

123
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.720
It's my birthday present, isn't it?

124
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.120
Yes.

125
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.620
I bought you something, too! Your own darts, Mr. Usuda.

126
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.420
Although there were a lot of soft plastic darts around,

127
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.920
these hard steel darts were really tough to find.

128
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.920
I see. Is that right?

129
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.820
You guys are really efficient, after all!

130
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.620
Of course, I meant to give it as a gift to you, Mr. Usuda!

131
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.020
Kogure, do you know why I wanted the steel darts?

132
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.520
No.

133
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.620
It's because...

134
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.420
I can't make you panic with plastic darts,

135
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.720
like I'm doing now. Can I?

136
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.520
It seems the pool table's open now!

137
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.620
Since you went out of your way to get the cue for me,

138
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.720
I guess I may as well try it out!

139
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.120
Anyway! Go on home and tell Ran,

140
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.520
that Pops Kogoro got a request to solve a difficult case,

141
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.220
and won't be home for a while.

142
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.020
So, Yuzuki my dear,

143
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.020
won't you please make me a Gimlet?

144
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.320
What? Are you sure you can do your job drinking?

145
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.920
I'll be fine, fine.

146
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.620
Don't blame me for what may happen later.

147
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.720
Pops! Let's go home, already!

148
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.920
Ran was really pissed, you know!

149
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.420
Come on, shut up!

150
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.020
Coming back time and again.

151
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.820
Can't you see that I'm working?

152
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.920
All you're doing is drinking!

153
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.120
Yuzuki my dear, another Gimlet, please!

154
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.520
Please think it out like you should now!

155
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.920
Once this mystery is solved,

156
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.620
I'm planning to upload it on my blog, you see.

157
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.820
Don't you worry, because the mystery is almost solved.

158
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.320
Is that so?

159
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.020
No joke?

160
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.620
The perp probably spilled some lime-vinegar.

161
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.320
Moreover, the kind with yuzu in it.

162
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.420
Yuzu lime vinegar?

163
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.820
Hey.

164
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.720
In other words, that is...

165
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.620
That is?

166
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.520
That is yuzu and lime.

167
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.720
Yuzu and lime! Like so.

168
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.220
-It's got the pop and all, see! -He's wasted.

169
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.320
So, Mr. Usuda's fallen asleep.

170
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.720
Yes, he's a weak drinker and yet he wants to drink.

171
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.820
Talk about bummers,

172
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.620
that billiard cue cost 100,000 yen.

173
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.520
The darts, case and all that I got for him

174
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.020
cost me 60,000 yen too.

175
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.920
You're lucky, Kishiura,

176
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.220
that you only had to buy him 5 to 6 cases of film, right?

177
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.920
I told you, didn't I?

178
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.220
That he asked me to buy him the poster of an idol

179
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.020
through internet auction for his birthday.

180
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.720
Come to think of it, you were giving it to him at the company.

181
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.320
It cost me 30,000 yen, autograph and all, you know!

182
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.620
May I take a look at it?

183
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.220
Don't get it dirty, you know,

184
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.320
'cuz Mr. Usuda's going to get at me if you do.

185
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.220
I know!

186
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.220
Yoko Okino.

187
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.620
Okay then, shall we have another drink before leaving?

188
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.220
I guess so.

189
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.120
All you've been doing is making the drinks,

190
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.120
so you haven't been able to drink much, have you?

191
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.020
Come to think of it,

192
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.620
I feel like all I've been doing was crushing ice with this.

193
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.620
Then how about another one of the first champagne that we drank?

194
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.120
Yes! That was good.

195
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.620
-What do you say? -Fine with me.

196
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.820
Excuse me! A bottle of champagne, please!

197
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.720
-Right away! -And three glasses, too!

198
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.620
That person at the counter, isn't he Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.320
No joke! You mean that renown detective?

200
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.120
I somehow feel like I'm being watched.

201
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.620
I want to take a picture of him!

202
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.420
Maybe he's just a look alike?

203
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.320
I guess so. I don't think he'd be such a drunkard.

204
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.020
I'm not at home with things like this after all.

205
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.920
Hey, hey! Don't face it towards me!

206
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.120
Mr. Kogure, please.

207
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.720
When it comes to jobs requiring strength, you can count on Kogure!

208
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.820
Yes, yes. Please leave it to me.

209
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.120
What's with this? It's really tight.

210
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.120
Hey! Don't face it this way, you know!

211
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.120
I know.

212
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.020
-It's bursting out! -Stupid!

213
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.420
It's splashing on the poster!

214
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.520
I really heard that sound.

215
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.120
That was champagne just now, wasn't it?

216
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.220
The edge of the poster got wet!

217
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.720
Shoots!

218
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.120
Excuse me, please bring us three hot towels!

219
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.420
Yes!

220
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.920
How about the sound of the package of the hot towels being opened?

221
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.120
Is it different from the sound you heard?

222
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.520
The sound of the cork being removed

223
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.520
sounds closer to what I heard after all.

224
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.420
Hey! Some have flown onto Mr. Usuda, too.

225
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.420
What? Shoots!

226
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.720
What's that?

227
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.920
There's something that looks like a red dot on Mr. Usuda's neck.

228
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.420
True.

229
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.420
Rather, he's not breathing.

230
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.220
Don't tell me...

231
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.920
Mr. Usuda...

232
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.920
Mr. Usuda!

233
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.720
Are you all right?

234
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.820
Hey, what's up?

235
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.420
Mr. Usuda's not moving as if he's dead!

236
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.320
What?

237
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.320
It's not as if he's dead,

238
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.920
he's really dead.

239
00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:48.413
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

240
00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:50.713
I got a job request from a woman bartender

241
00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:52.813
called Yuzuki Fukui, who's in love with me,

242
00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:56.413
and came to the pool bar where she works.

243
00:13:56.413 --> 00:14:00.413
But the one that refuses to let go of me, wasn't her.

244
00:14:00.413 --> 00:14:03.313
But rather, the case.

245
00:14:03.313 --> 00:14:07.313
Unless we do any autopsy, we can't tell for sure

246
00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.813
but the cause of death is most likely, suffocation

247
00:14:09.813 --> 00:14:11.013
due to nerve poisoning.

248
00:14:11.013 --> 00:14:12.813
Poisoning?

249
00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:16.413
Yes, from this wound behind his neck.

250
00:14:16.413 --> 00:14:17.613
It seems that a sharp object

251
00:14:17.613 --> 00:14:20.613
such as an eyeleteer laced with poison, was poked in.

252
00:14:20.613 --> 00:14:23.113
But, if he was poked with such a thing,

253
00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.713
he would've shouted or made a scene I'm sure.

254
00:14:25.713 --> 00:14:28.613
I think he died falling asleep.

255
00:14:28.613 --> 00:14:32.713
-What? -Because the victim seemed wasted.

256
00:14:32.713 --> 00:14:34.813
Well, so it's you again?

257
00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:37.113
Yes, sir, Mr. Inspector!

258
00:14:37.113 --> 00:14:41.113
Don't tell me that you coincidentally happened to be here again?

259
00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:43.913
Yes. It is indeed that coincidence again.

260
00:14:43.913 --> 00:14:46.913
Yes, detectives have the duty of confidentiality.

261
00:14:46.913 --> 00:14:48.313
No matter what the circumstances,

262
00:14:48.313 --> 00:14:51.613
we may not talk about the client to others.

263
00:14:51.613 --> 00:14:55.013
In order to prevent Yuzuki from being suspected,

264
00:14:55.013 --> 00:14:57.413
I'll have to keep my mouth shut as to her job request to me.

265
00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:59.313
And for the sake of the pride of being a detective, too.

266
00:14:59.313 --> 00:15:01.313
I'm the one that asked him to come here!

267
00:15:01.313 --> 00:15:02.913
What?

268
00:15:02.913 --> 00:15:05.513
Because I had a mystery that I wanted Mr. Mouri to solve for me.

269
00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:09.613
-A mystery? -I hear this popping sound during work

270
00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:12.313
like the sound of the cork of a champagne bottle being removed.

271
00:15:12.313 --> 00:15:15.313
-What? -Of course at that time,

272
00:15:15.313 --> 00:15:18.013
no champagne is being served to any customers.

273
00:15:18.013 --> 00:15:19.813
Even when I clean the shop after closing time,

274
00:15:19.813 --> 00:15:23.113
no cork of any kind has been found.

275
00:15:23.113 --> 00:15:26.313
However, I smell the fragrance of yuzu.

276
00:15:26.313 --> 00:15:29.513
By the way, how much are you getting paid for this request?

277
00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:30.613
She said that she's going to drop all the charges

278
00:15:30.613 --> 00:15:32.613
for all the drinks I drank here so far.

279
00:15:32.613 --> 00:15:35.313
Of course, you're going to have to pay for

280
00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:37.013
the Gimlet that I served tonight though.

281
00:15:37.013 --> 00:15:39.113
What? I do?

282
00:15:39.113 --> 00:15:43.213
So, they're the three

283
00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:45.813
who were drinking with the victim? Is that correct?

284
00:15:45.813 --> 00:15:47.113
Yes, sir.

285
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:51.813
I asked them several questions before you got here, Inspector.

286
00:15:51.813 --> 00:15:53.713
Starting from the person to your right.

287
00:15:53.713 --> 00:15:56.713
She's Ms. Mika Kishiura, age 30.

288
00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:59.913
He's Mr. Kensaku Hatsumura, age 31.

289
00:15:59.913 --> 00:16:03.613
And, he's Mr. Monpei Kogure, age 28.

290
00:16:03.613 --> 00:16:06.113
They all work at the same company

291
00:16:06.113 --> 00:16:07.813
along with the victim, Mr. Usuda who is their department head.

292
00:16:07.813 --> 00:16:13.213
And they were all here tonight to celebrate his birthday.

293
00:16:14.913 --> 00:16:18.313
Which means that one of three here,

294
00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:20.313
had a grudge against the department head

295
00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.613
and poisoned him to death.

296
00:16:22.613 --> 00:16:24.713
Hey, hold it, will you?

297
00:16:24.713 --> 00:16:28.013
We were all just celebrating his birthday.

298
00:16:28.013 --> 00:16:30.613
We didn't poison him to death!

299
00:16:30.613 --> 00:16:33.313
Didn't you three do it?

300
00:16:33.313 --> 00:16:37.513
You guys were shooting glances at me, a detective, and whispering.

301
00:16:37.513 --> 00:16:41.813
We were saying that you look just like the "Sleeping Kogoro!"

302
00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:43.813
We had no idea that you were the man himself.

303
00:16:43.813 --> 00:16:47.113
Besides, we've got no motive to kill him.

304
00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:50.913
But you guys were all talking among yourselves

305
00:16:50.913 --> 00:16:53.013
after the department head got wasted, right?

306
00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.513
Saying things like he forced you

307
00:16:55.513 --> 00:16:57.013
to buy super expensive birthday gifts,

308
00:16:57.013 --> 00:16:59.213
so you were pissed.

309
00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:01.513
You were listening, sonny?

310
00:17:01.513 --> 00:17:03.813
Yes! Because I got good ears!

311
00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:06.513
Moreover, you also mentioned that a person called Yoshikuwa

312
00:17:06.513 --> 00:17:09.313
that the department head despised committed suicide.

313
00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:14.613
And that the man called Yoshikuwa was going with you too, miss!

314
00:17:14.613 --> 00:17:16.513
Is that true?

315
00:17:16.513 --> 00:17:18.313
Yes. It's true.

316
00:17:18.313 --> 00:17:22.413
Not only that, Mr. Hatsumura here was his senior in university,

317
00:17:22.413 --> 00:17:24.913
and Mr. Kogure entered the company at the same time he did!

318
00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:28.213
Besides, we'd never play billiards and darts

319
00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:31.113
with somebody we hate so much as to want to kill him!

320
00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:32.913
You were playing games with the victim?

321
00:17:32.913 --> 00:17:35.813
Yes, until the department head got wasted,

322
00:17:35.813 --> 00:17:38.813
we were taking turns being his game partner.

323
00:17:38.813 --> 00:17:43.013
Was the department head really playing with those three people?

324
00:17:43.013 --> 00:17:46.313
That's right! You kept going home each time,

325
00:17:46.313 --> 00:17:47.813
so you didn't see what happened, did you?

326
00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:50.413
That department head really was a problem, you see.

327
00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:53.413
The dart board here is only for soft darts,

328
00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:54.813
but he tried to use the steel darts

329
00:17:54.813 --> 00:17:56.213
that were given to him as a birthday present

330
00:17:56.213 --> 00:17:59.213
and got into trouble with the other customers.

331
00:17:59.213 --> 00:18:00.713
Those three people went over to stop the fight

332
00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:03.813
and managed to cool everyone off.

333
00:18:03.813 --> 00:18:05.813
It seemed they decided to let him rest at the table

334
00:18:05.813 --> 00:18:08.213
and wait for him to get sober.

335
00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.013
And, what about after that?

336
00:18:10.013 --> 00:18:13.713
Three of them were playing billiards and darts for a while.

337
00:18:13.713 --> 00:18:16.613
They seemed to be switching partner each time one person lost.

338
00:18:16.613 --> 00:18:20.013
Which means that when two of the three were playing,

339
00:18:20.013 --> 00:18:21.113
each person had the chance

340
00:18:21.113 --> 00:18:24.413
to spend time with the department head alone, right?

341
00:18:24.413 --> 00:18:27.013
In other words, each of you three people had the chance

342
00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:31.813
to be alone with the department head, just the two of you.

343
00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:34.813
Okay, we're going to have to do a body check on you,

344
00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.713
as well as check your belongings.

345
00:18:39.913 --> 00:18:42.113
A billiard cue.

346
00:18:42.113 --> 00:18:44.313
It sure does look expensive!

347
00:18:44.313 --> 00:18:48.913
Yes. It cost 160,000 yen but was selling for 100,000 yen

348
00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:50.313
so I decided to get it for the department head.

349
00:18:50.313 --> 00:18:53.513
And, just as this boy mentioned.

350
00:18:53.513 --> 00:18:57.213
I didn't intend to buy him such an expensive gift,

351
00:18:57.213 --> 00:18:59.513
so I was a bit annoyed.

352
00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.513
Do you think I'd kill somebody for a reason like that?

353
00:19:02.513 --> 00:19:07.113
But if you were to attach a poisoned needle on the tip of the cue,

354
00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:08.913
even if you were away from the table,

355
00:19:08.913 --> 00:19:11.413
you could probably have poked him with it?

356
00:19:11.413 --> 00:19:13.913
What? If I did something so obvious,

357
00:19:13.913 --> 00:19:15.913
somebody would've remembered it!

358
00:19:15.913 --> 00:19:18.313
I didn't do anything of that sort, did I?

359
00:19:18.313 --> 00:19:19.613
No.

360
00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:21.313
As soon as the department got wasted,

361
00:19:21.313 --> 00:19:24.813
he hastily put the cue back into the case.

362
00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:27.913
I see. So, these darts

363
00:19:27.913 --> 00:19:31.413
were what caused the fight with the customers.

364
00:19:31.413 --> 00:19:34.813
I didn't deliberately buy it to cause the fight, you know!

365
00:19:34.813 --> 00:19:38.613
I only bought it because the department head told me to buy it for him.

366
00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:42.413
I received a vintage dart board that was a keepsake of my grandfather,

367
00:19:42.413 --> 00:19:43.913
so I gave it to the department head.

368
00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:45.913
Then, he told me to go and buy him darts to go with it, too.

369
00:19:45.913 --> 00:19:49.113
I don't play darts at all, you see.

370
00:19:49.113 --> 00:19:50.113
Come to think of it,

371
00:19:50.113 --> 00:19:52.313
when the department head pretended to throw the dart at you,

372
00:19:52.313 --> 00:19:54.213
you were really panicked, weren't you?

373
00:19:56.213 --> 00:19:59.913
Yes. I really panicked back then.

374
00:19:59.913 --> 00:20:03.413
I'll bet you laced poison to the tip of the dart

375
00:20:03.413 --> 00:20:05.213
and threw it from a distance poking it into him?

376
00:20:05.213 --> 00:20:08.613
Didn't I just tell you? That I'm not good at darts.

377
00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:10.813
Besides, if I were going to throw it from a distance,

378
00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:13.613
it would be easier for me to poke it into him at point blank range!

379
00:20:13.613 --> 00:20:16.213
-Well, I guess so. -If you insist on suspecting me,

380
00:20:16.213 --> 00:20:20.113
why don't you go ahead and scrutinize the darts?

381
00:20:20.113 --> 00:20:22.613
Of course we will.

382
00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:26.713
You got him several boxes of film

383
00:20:26.713 --> 00:20:29.013
and a poster of an idol.

384
00:20:29.013 --> 00:20:32.213
Compared to the other two, your gifts are way cheaper.

385
00:20:32.213 --> 00:20:36.713
Hey! That poster cost me 30,000 yen autograph and all, you know.

386
00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:38.813
Well, I couldn't help but get it for him

387
00:20:38.813 --> 00:20:41.213
because he was sitting near my desk

388
00:20:41.213 --> 00:20:44.213
and persistently repeating that he wanted it.

389
00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:49.013
The wet part of the poster, it smells like...

390
00:20:49.913 --> 00:20:52.313
This fragrance is the smell of yuzu?

391
00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:55.413
This is...

392
00:20:55.413 --> 00:20:56.813
Pops realized it, too!

393
00:20:56.813 --> 00:20:58.913
It's Yoko's poster!

394
00:20:58.913 --> 00:21:02.213
Moreover, it's the super rare western bikini shot!

395
00:21:02.213 --> 00:21:03.413
Is that what he noticed?

396
00:21:03.413 --> 00:21:05.513
I mean, don't wet it!

397
00:21:05.513 --> 00:21:07.513
I mean the beauty's all wet!

398
00:21:07.513 --> 00:21:09.113
And he's making bad jokes, too.

399
00:21:09.113 --> 00:21:11.513
The champagne splashed on it

400
00:21:11.513 --> 00:21:14.013
when Mr. Kogure tried to pull the cork out.

401
00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:18.313
By the way, you seemed to have taken quite a lot of pictures.

402
00:21:18.313 --> 00:21:20.913
Did the department head like pictures?

403
00:21:20.913 --> 00:21:24.413
Yes. They're pictures to be uploaded on his blog!

404
00:21:24.413 --> 00:21:27.613
But we're actually the ones

405
00:21:27.613 --> 00:21:29.013
who choose the pictures and upload them.

406
00:21:29.013 --> 00:21:31.513
The department head's not at home with digitals, you see.

407
00:21:31.513 --> 00:21:35.013
Despite that, he likes to put on airs and upload blogs.

408
00:21:35.013 --> 00:21:37.113
Well, I'm glad that we don't have

409
00:21:37.113 --> 00:21:40.613
to choose pictures for him anymore from now on.

410
00:21:41.613 --> 00:21:45.413
Well, something like that would never lead to murder, though.

411
00:21:45.413 --> 00:21:49.313
By the way, who was making the whiskey and water drinks?

412
00:21:49.313 --> 00:21:52.813
I was the one making most of it.

413
00:21:52.813 --> 00:21:55.913
Then, we'll have to check this too.

414
00:21:55.913 --> 00:21:58.513
Because ice picks like the needle of darts

415
00:21:58.513 --> 00:22:00.013
are sharp objects that can be used to kill someone.

416
00:22:00.013 --> 00:22:03.113
They are very similar in shape to the murder weapon.

417
00:22:08.913 --> 00:22:12.713
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

418
00:22:12.713 --> 00:22:16.013
It seems that my saga of being a detective

419
00:22:16.013 --> 00:22:18.613
has brought upon disaster to this pool bar

420
00:22:18.613 --> 00:22:22.313
that was supposed to be my haven of comfort.

421
00:22:22.313 --> 00:22:24.013
Well, well...

422
00:22:24.013 --> 00:22:28.813
It seems that this case won't let me sleep again tonight.

423
00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:55.813
"Next Episode" -There was no trace of poison being laced?

424
00:23:55.813 --> 00:23:58.913
What's going on? No murder weapon.

425
00:23:58.913 --> 00:24:01.913
It's the same as the pick-pocket case the other day.

426
00:24:04.213 --> 00:24:06.413
This is...

427
00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:10.013
Why would clay be stuck on the bottom of something like that?

428
00:24:10.013 --> 00:24:14.113
So, the perp was the customer who had it out with the victim.

429
00:24:14.113 --> 00:24:16.013
Don't tell me...

430
00:24:16.013 --> 00:24:21.413
Next Conan, "Kogoro is at the Bar (Part 2)"

431
00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:39.613
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:39.613 --> 00:24:41.613
"Clay"

433
00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.113
There's no clay in a bar only play.

434
00:24:43.113 --> 00:24:44.413
Are you drunk, Mr. Mouri?

435
00:24:44.413 --> 00:24:46.713
Pops, stay in the bar.
