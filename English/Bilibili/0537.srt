1
00:00:01.457 --> 00:00:03.157
Calling all officers!

2
00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:05.257
Head for the Nabei residence on the double!

3
00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.757
There's a possibility that the suspect

4
00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:09.057
has possession of Takagi's gun!

5
00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:12.557
Be on full guard when coming in contact with him!

6
00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.157
Listen! Life is lost in a split second!

7
00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:25.457
Darn, you asked for it.

8
00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:27.657
Darn! Dogs.

9
00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:29.357
They've figured it out!

10
00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.857
No, Officer Sato?

11
00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:39.957
Officer... Sato...

12
00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:44.057
Officer Takagi was shot?

13
00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:46.357
Why does Officer Takagi have to die just because

14
00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:49.157
we promised to go to the hot spring together?

15
00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:52.357
-Hot spring? -Officer Takagi!

16
00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:53.757
Oh, no, I mean...

17
00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:55.157
You know, the usual?

18
00:00:55.157 --> 00:00:57.257
The evidence that he coincidentally put inside his pocket

19
00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.757
during the investigation

20
00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:01.957
saved his life from the culprit's bullet.

21
00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:05.257
Then, how is Officer Takagi?

22
00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:09.357
He's gone through treatment and is sleeping in his room now.

23
00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:10.957
He's fast asleep.

24
00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:14.857
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

25
00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:17.457
Saturday nights are for mystery.

26
00:01:17.457 --> 00:01:19.457
A forewarning letter of crime arrives from Thief Kid.

27
00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:22.157
His next target is an innovative formidable safe.

28
00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:23.557
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.457
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.657
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:14.626
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 1)"

32
00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:18.226
An almost suicidal attempt to arrest the culprit!

33
00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:19.826
It was announced later,

34
00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:22.326
that a police officer, while being shot by the culprit's bullet,

35
00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:25.626
pinned the culprit down, and this eventually lead to the arrest!

36
00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:29.326
So, this is the article about you, Officer Takagi, isn't it?

37
00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.826
Yes, well... it turned out that way to begin with

38
00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:35.326
because my gun was stolen by the culprit, you see.

39
00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:37.226
You'd better be grateful,

40
00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:38.926
because thanks to my genius deduction,

41
00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:41.026
we found out that

42
00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:44.726
there was a scar on the back of the serial killer.

43
00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:47.626
Although like always, I don't remember a thing.

44
00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.226
But, I'm sure glad the case was solved!

45
00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:53.226
Yeah, me too!

46
00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:54.726
Including a lot of other things...

47
00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:01.326
Officer Takagi.

48
00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:03.326
Officer Takagi?

49
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.926
Your face is red.

50
00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.726
Did something good happen?

51
00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:11.126
Oh, no...

52
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:13.926
Nothing in particular.

53
00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:17.126
I know! Because I saw!

54
00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:21.026
What? What did you see?

55
00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:24.226
Well, he was with Officer Sato in the hospital room and...

56
00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.626
Conan, hold it.

57
00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:28.326
Just because they're always on the winning end.

58
00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:32.226
They think they can keep pushing their weight around.

59
00:04:32.226 --> 00:04:34.526
Inspector Nakamori?

60
00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.026
As for me, I repeatedly, almost,

61
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.926
but never, get to nab that snobbish thief

62
00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:43.426
So, I've been disappointed and burned, God knows how many times.

63
00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:45.726
Hot!

64
00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.026
Oh, I'm sorry!

65
00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:49.626
Was it too hot?

66
00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:51.526
No, it's okay.

67
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.226
My heart is chilled,

68
00:04:55.226 --> 00:04:57.926
so something this hot is just right for me!

69
00:04:57.926 --> 00:05:00.226
Your heart is chilled?

70
00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:03.826
Well, Thief Kid's been quite quiet recently

71
00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:06.226
so in other words, I kind of have nothing to live for.

72
00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:09.826
Haven't you read the papers?

73
00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:10.826
The papers?

74
00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:13.426
There's a really big article on the front pages!

75
00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:16.926
It says that Thief Kid

76
00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:21.426
sent a challenging letter to Jirokichi Suzuki, his arch rival.

77
00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.126
Advisor Suzuki!

78
00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:30.926
Just what is the meaning of this?

79
00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:34.026
Please tell us in more detail!

80
00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:37.026
What on earth is Kid going to come and steal?

81
00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.226
Beats me...

82
00:05:41.126 --> 00:05:42.626
What does that mean?

83
00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:47.426
On the letter of warning, this is what was written.

84
00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:50.726
"I'd advise you to resign yourself, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki."

85
00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:55.026
"Let's not fight a futile battle and surrender solemnly,"

86
00:05:55.026 --> 00:05:57.826
"when the moon is swallowed by the darkness."

87
00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:00.226
"And I, in front of your surprised eyes of wonder, break into"

88
00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:02.626
"the great safe that has been handed down to you for generations,"

89
00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:05.726
"Thief Kid."

90
00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:07.426
The great safe,

91
00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:08.926
don't tell me...

92
00:06:08.926 --> 00:06:10.126
Right.

93
00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:13.826
The masterpiece of a lifetime that the great puppeteer,

94
00:06:13.826 --> 00:06:17.826
Kichiemon Samizu is said to have made just before his death.

95
00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:20.826
The impregnable great safe,

96
00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:22.826
Iron Badger!

97
00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:26.926
This is that letter of challenge!

98
00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:31.726
Well, it seems that he's more interested in the safe itself

99
00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:34.226
than the contents of the safe, but,

100
00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:36.226
I sure am interested to see

101
00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:39.826
whether he can break through the door of Iron Badger

102
00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:41.826
that up to this time,

103
00:06:41.826 --> 00:06:45.026
counter-attacked even the greatest known thieves of all times

104
00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:47.326
that attempted to break into our house.

105
00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:49.626
Very interesting, my foot!

106
00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:51.126
Despite this letter of challenge being sent here,

107
00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:53.726
it's very upsetting for we the police

108
00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:56.826
to think that the press got this information before we did!

109
00:06:56.826 --> 00:06:58.726
It's Inspector Nakamori from the Metropolitan Police Station!

110
00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:01.726
Just what do you propose to do this time to cope with Kid?

111
00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:03.626
Inspector Nakamori, any comments?

112
00:07:03.626 --> 00:07:05.326
Inspector!

113
00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:08.426
How should I know? I just found out a while ago myself.

114
00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:13.226
Well, take a good look at the picture on the letter of challenge!

115
00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:19.826
It's different from the usual illustration!

116
00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:23.626
That's why I didn't report it to the police

117
00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:26.026
because there's a possibility that it's an imposter.

118
00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:29.126
Then, why didn't you say so to the press too?

119
00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:33.426
If I win this match that everybody thinks is genuine,

120
00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:37.326
I can add this to my tale of heroic exploits, can't I?

121
00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:40.526
This old man's... still at it...

122
00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:44.126
At any rate, the police is to stay out of this,

123
00:07:44.126 --> 00:07:46.626
because it isn't Thief Kid.

124
00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:54.926
"Three Days Later" -What? It could be an imposter?

125
00:07:54.926 --> 00:07:58.126
The Thief Kid that sent the letter of challenge this time?

126
00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:01.626
Yes, that's what Uncle Jirokichi said!

127
00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:03.226
I sent you a picture

128
00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:05.126
of the letter of challenge by cell phone, didn't I?

129
00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:06.526
Wasn't there something strange about it?

130
00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:07.726
Yes.

131
00:08:07.726 --> 00:08:12.326
It's true that it wasn't the usual illustration.

132
00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:18.326
Besides, his letters of challenge are always written horizontally.

133
00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:22.626
The phrasing in the letter's also old fashioned and quite weird.

134
00:08:22.626 --> 00:08:25.626
Then, why'd you call us over here?

135
00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:27.226
It's a woman's intuition!

136
00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:31.026
I can't help feeling that Kid's going to show up!

137
00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:35.526
Well, although it seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way.

138
00:08:35.526 --> 00:08:38.126
Don't be off your guard thinking

139
00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:39.826
that this guy's not the real Kid, understand?

140
00:08:39.826 --> 00:08:41.426
Tonight's the night of the new moon,

141
00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:42.726
in other words, the time when the moon will be swallowed by the darkness,

142
00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:44.526
as was written in the letter of challenge!

143
00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:47.726
Make sure you tightly secure the area around the room where the safe is!

144
00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:49.126
Yes, sir!

145
00:08:49.126 --> 00:08:52.826
Inspector Nakamori... he's here.

146
00:08:52.826 --> 00:08:55.526
But, why guard the area around the room?

147
00:08:55.526 --> 00:08:57.226
I think it'd be better if they keep guard

148
00:08:57.226 --> 00:08:59.926
inside the room in front of the safe.

149
00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:02.826
It's because that's not necessary, Detective Mouri.

150
00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:09.226
Would you like to see my pride and joy, Iron Badger?

151
00:09:09.226 --> 00:09:11.926
A safe made by Kichiemon Samizu.

152
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.426
Come to think of it, some time ago,

153
00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:17.426
we went through hell at a house of tricks that Kichiemon built.

154
00:09:26.826 --> 00:09:30.826
So, is that the impregnable safe?

155
00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:34.826
Just by the looks of it, it looks pretty tough to open.

156
00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:45.326
There's nothing in this room, not even furniture.

157
00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:47.226
But, it's embedded in the wall,

158
00:09:47.226 --> 00:09:49.526
and looks more like a room with a safe than a safe.

159
00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:51.426
That's right.

160
00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:54.126
The depth of the room is a little less than 4m,

161
00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.026
and the size is approximately six mats.

162
00:09:56.026 --> 00:09:58.826
It's surrounded by an iron plate 50cm thick.

163
00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:00.926
In other words, it's a little steel room!

164
00:10:00.926 --> 00:10:06.526
During the war, I took shelter here with my parents

165
00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:09.326
and made it alive through the air raids!

166
00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:12.026
Which means that there are air holes?

167
00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:15.026
Yeah. There's small window for ventilation,

168
00:10:15.026 --> 00:10:18.126
and see, under the door!

169
00:10:18.126 --> 00:10:21.626
Do you see that space about 3cm?

170
00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:23.726
But, did you have someone open it for you

171
00:10:23.726 --> 00:10:25.326
when you went outside?

172
00:10:25.326 --> 00:10:28.826
It opens easily from the inside.

173
00:10:28.826 --> 00:10:34.126
I'm the only one who knows how to open it from outside now, though.

174
00:10:34.126 --> 00:10:36.826
Okay, then, would you let us take a look at it at closer range?

175
00:10:36.826 --> 00:10:38.026
Hold it!

176
00:10:39.126 --> 00:10:43.126
If I remember correctly, you smoke, do you not, Detective Mouri?

177
00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:44.626
Yes.

178
00:10:44.626 --> 00:10:47.026
Would you give me one, please?

179
00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:49.126
Yes, of course.

180
00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:59.426
He's a bodyguard that I hired the other day.

181
00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:02.426
He's reticent, but very dependable!

182
00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:04.826
Yes, I can tell.

183
00:11:06.926 --> 00:11:09.426
If you will excuse me, then.

184
00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:19.826
What's going on? What's that sound?

185
00:11:19.826 --> 00:11:21.826
Well, just watch!

186
00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:31.326
Bars surrounded the room in an instant.

187
00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:34.726
It's a weight sensor that I installed!

188
00:11:34.726 --> 00:11:37.926
It even reacts to the weight of one cigarette!

189
00:11:37.926 --> 00:11:40.926
That's why there's no furniture here.

190
00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:42.826
Now do you understand?

191
00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:47.126
He can't even come near this safe!

192
00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:53.126
This old man really likes to surround things.

193
00:11:56.126 --> 00:11:59.126
Akitsu, pick up the cigarette that's on the floor inside

194
00:11:59.126 --> 00:12:00.826
and get rid of it!

195
00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:02.326
But...

196
00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:06.626
If I go inside, won't the bars come down on me like just now?

197
00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:07.726
You fool!

198
00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.326
It's switched off!

199
00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:11.526
Just hurry and clean it up now, will you?

200
00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:13.026
Oh, yes, sir!

201
00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:15.326
Gosh.

202
00:12:15.326 --> 00:12:18.126
I tell you, he's a new one I just hired the other day, but...

203
00:12:18.126 --> 00:12:20.126
he sure is useless.

204
00:12:22.426 --> 00:12:24.826
This cigarette...

205
00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:26.826
Should I give it back to Mr. Mouri?

206
00:12:26.826 --> 00:12:28.126
You idiot!

207
00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:30.426
You're going to make him smoke a cigarette that was on the floor?

208
00:12:30.426 --> 00:12:32.726
Hurry up and throw it away in the wastebasket or something!

209
00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:34.226
Yes, sir!

210
00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:39.226
Once you're finished with your business, would you please

211
00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.226
stay away from that door?

212
00:12:41.226 --> 00:12:43.426
You're in the way of security.

213
00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:47.426
I'm telling you that it's useless,

214
00:12:47.426 --> 00:12:49.326
because this guy's an imposter!

215
00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:56.926
Detective Mouri and everyone else, go on home!

216
00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.826
Nothing's going to happen tonight.

217
00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:04.226
That goes for you too, little one, arch rival of Kid.

218
00:13:04.226 --> 00:13:06.126
Yep.

219
00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:07.726
Okay, shall we head on home then?

220
00:13:07.726 --> 00:13:09.726
What? Are you leaving?

221
00:13:09.726 --> 00:13:12.326
Well, it doesn't seem like Thief Kid will be coming.

222
00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:13.926
Right!

223
00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.826
Won't you wait just a while longer?

224
00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:19.526
Ouch.

225
00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:23.926
I'm sorry, sonny, are you okay?

226
00:13:23.926 --> 00:13:25.126
Yep.

227
00:13:25.126 --> 00:13:26.726
I was looking for the doggie

228
00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:30.126
and on all fours looking for it, so I wasn't looking ahead.

229
00:13:30.126 --> 00:13:33.226
Oh, you mean Uncle's doggie?

230
00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.326
Oh, yes.

231
00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:38.726
If it's Uncle's doggie Lupin, I heard from Uncle

232
00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:42.426
that he got sick and was hospitalized a while ago.

233
00:13:42.426 --> 00:13:45.026
I mean, you're his maid and you didn't know?

234
00:13:45.026 --> 00:13:46.326
Oh, no.

235
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.126
I just started working here from today, you see.

236
00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:50.926
But, how disappointing,

237
00:13:50.926 --> 00:13:54.826
because I was looking forward to seeing the cute doggie.

238
00:13:54.826 --> 00:13:58.526
The doggie that I had died last month, so the more...

239
00:13:58.526 --> 00:14:00.826
I see.

240
00:14:00.826 --> 00:14:03.626
Well, I had it from when I was little,

241
00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:05.926
so it was already pretty old.

242
00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:07.326
Oh, no!

243
00:14:07.326 --> 00:14:09.026
I shouldn't be talking to you, I'm still working!

244
00:14:09.026 --> 00:14:11.626
I'm sorry! Excuse me!

245
00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:12.926
Inspector!

246
00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:16.926
Superintendent Chaki's orders are to withdraw from here!

247
00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:18.326
What?

248
00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:22.026
It seems that there was pressure from Advisor Suzuki to do so.

249
00:14:22.026 --> 00:14:25.626
Come to think of it, they were talking away with each other

250
00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:29.226
about being alma maters of the same university.

251
00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:35.426
Well, there seems to be a super security device here after all.

252
00:14:35.426 --> 00:14:40.226
Yeah, I guess they'll be fine without us.

253
00:14:42.826 --> 00:14:45.326
Hey, gramps!

254
00:14:45.326 --> 00:14:47.726
Switch off all the security devices right now!

255
00:14:47.726 --> 00:14:50.126
It's on the floor!

256
00:14:50.126 --> 00:14:52.326
The card that wasn't there before!

257
00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:57.126
This is...

258
00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:58.126
"Just as promised,"

259
00:14:58.126 --> 00:15:00.126
"I guess I shall come to get the precious treasure"

260
00:15:00.126 --> 00:15:01.926
"that is inside the tummy of the badger,"

261
00:15:01.926 --> 00:15:05.126
"before the moon shows its face out of the darkness."

262
00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:07.626
"Thief Kid!"

263
00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:09.726
This is genuine!

264
00:15:09.726 --> 00:15:13.026
But, how did he put this card in this room?

265
00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:16.826
Why didn't the weight sensor go off?

266
00:15:19.326 --> 00:15:22.026
I guess, all's fine.

267
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:41.101
Please take a look!

268
00:15:41.101 --> 00:15:43.501
This security group that envelopes the Suzuki residence!

269
00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:45.801
It's become more real that Thief Kid will be coming.

270
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:47.301
More and more members of security squad

271
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:48.801
are gathering at the residence!

272
00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:51.901
Will Thief Kid really appear as promised

273
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:54.501
amidst all this tight security?

274
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:56.001
He'll come!

275
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:59.201
He'll come without fail!

276
00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:03.301
Wearing that hateful dauntless grin on his face.

277
00:16:03.301 --> 00:16:04.901
Listen, all of you!

278
00:16:04.901 --> 00:16:06.601
Let's catch the thief today

279
00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:10.201
and turn his snobbish face into one of dupe!

280
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:17.201
Making a big fuss over an imposter.

281
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:19.101
He's the real one!

282
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:24.901
It's true that his first letter smelled fishy,

283
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.101
but it was all just

284
00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:29.001
some fancy joke of his to make fun of we, the police.

285
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:34.501
But this letter of challenge that was found inside the safe

286
00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:36.701
is undoubtedly what he put there!

287
00:16:36.701 --> 00:16:40.401
So, now, you calling him the imposter is the queer!

288
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:42.901
Well, even if it were to be so...

289
00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:46.301
I don't see the need for all this tight security.

290
00:16:46.301 --> 00:16:47.501
Have you forgotten?

291
00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:51.001
What he's after is the great impregnable safe made by

292
00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:56.301
the legendary genius of tricky gadgets, Kichiemon Samizu!

293
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:00.501
His ultimate goal is to open the door of Iron Badger!

294
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:04.501
It's loaded with gadgets to get rid of impudent ones

295
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.801
who dare try breaking into it.

296
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:08.601
It's so well made, that even I,

297
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:11.101
the only one who knows how to open it,

298
00:17:11.101 --> 00:17:14.001
at times, make mistakes and almost lose my life.

299
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:16.301
There's no one that could possibly open it!

300
00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.501
But, you're coping with the magician under the moon,

301
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:20.101
Thief Kid, you know!

302
00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:21.501
No matter what kind of safe it may be,

303
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:23.401
if it falls into his hands, he'll open it in the wink of an eye.

304
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:25.801
Even if he did have such a talent,

305
00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.901
he would never be able to get close to it!

306
00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:31.701
I showed you the security device in this room, didn't I?

307
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:35.101
Once he sets foot into this room, that's it.

308
00:17:35.101 --> 00:17:38.201
The weight sensor that's embedded in the floor will go off

309
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:40.801
and he'll be surrounded by iron bars in an instant

310
00:17:40.801 --> 00:17:43.101
and nothing more than rat in a trap!

311
00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:45.501
But,

312
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:50.501
Thief Kid actually put the letter of challenge in this room, didn't he?

313
00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:55.301
He already had something worked out to bypass the device here!

314
00:17:55.301 --> 00:18:00.301
Which means, when Thief Kid put that letter of challenge there,

315
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.701
he was near us, right?

316
00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:07.101
Because when the door of this room was opened the first time,

317
00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:08.901
nothing was here,

318
00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:12.301
but it was there the next time the door was opened, right?

319
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:16.501
All during that time, we were near this room.

320
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:19.001
If something is placed on the floor

321
00:18:19.001 --> 00:18:21.701
when the switch of the weight sensor is turned off,

322
00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:24.201
it doesn't respond even after the sensor is later turned on?

323
00:18:24.201 --> 00:18:28.501
Right, because it only responds to weight that is detected

324
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:30.801
after the device is switched on.

325
00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:34.701
Which means it was placed there after the switch was turned off.

326
00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:35.801
Come to think of it,

327
00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:38.201
Uncle, you turned the switch off back then, didn't you?

328
00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:42.301
Yes, when you showed us how the weight sensor worked,

329
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:45.401
by throwing a cigarette inside the room...

330
00:18:46.901 --> 00:18:49.001
What's this sound?

331
00:18:49.001 --> 00:18:51.001
Well, just wait and see!

332
00:18:56.501 --> 00:19:01.901
In order to retrieve the cigarette, you turned off the switch.

333
00:19:01.901 --> 00:19:03.001
Akitsu!

334
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.601
Pick up the cigarette that's on the floor and get rid of it!

335
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:08.201
But...

336
00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:12.501
If I go inside, won't the bars come down on me like just now?

337
00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:15.101
You fool! It's switched off!

338
00:19:15.101 --> 00:19:17.401
Just hurry and clean it up now, will you?

339
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:18.601
Oh, yes, sir!

340
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:21.101
Gosh.

341
00:19:21.101 --> 00:19:23.801
I tell you, he's a new one I just hired the other day, but...

342
00:19:23.801 --> 00:19:25.801
he sure is useless.

343
00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:34.401
That man called Akitsu went inside the room

344
00:19:34.401 --> 00:19:35.601
and picked the cigarette up!

345
00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:38.001
So, that guy was the Kid!

346
00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:39.601
He pretended to pick up the cigarette

347
00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:42.501
and audaciously placed the letter of challenge inside!

348
00:19:42.501 --> 00:19:43.801
But, I don't think that

349
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:46.701
Mr. Akitsu's the only one who could've put it there.

350
00:19:46.701 --> 00:19:48.901
The bodyguard who was constantly standing next to

351
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:50.301
old man Jirokichi could too.

352
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:51.901
He could've put it in the room,

353
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:53.601
just as old man Jirokichi was about to close the door.

354
00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:56.801
And, the maid who said that she just came here today,

355
00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:58.401
could've done it too.

356
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:02.601
She did say that she was on all fours looking around for the dog.

357
00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:05.101
But, she wasn't near the door

358
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:07.701
when the switch was turned off, was she?

359
00:20:07.701 --> 00:20:09.201
Nope!

360
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:13.401
She wasn't by the door that we were shown the security device!

361
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:16.101
But, in this room where the safe is...

362
00:20:18.101 --> 00:20:21.201
See, there's another door!

363
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:23.401
If the maid were the Kid,

364
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:25.501
she could pretend to be looking for the dog

365
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:27.801
and slide the letter under the door

366
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:30.901
when the guards were off their guard.

367
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:32.501
Right.

368
00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:35.801
Back then, Uncle was giving orders in a loud voice so...

369
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:38.301
She could've heard him.

370
00:20:38.301 --> 00:20:39.501
I see.

371
00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:41.901
Which means she could've known that the switch was turned off

372
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:44.401
even if she were over there.

373
00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:45.801
Besides, all three of them

374
00:20:45.801 --> 00:20:48.601
seems to have been hired only recently too.

375
00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:51.901
In other words, it's very likely that

376
00:20:51.901 --> 00:20:54.901
Kid snuck into this house in disguise.

377
00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:59.401
Okay! Bring that guy called Akitsu and the maid over here!

378
00:20:59.401 --> 00:21:02.301
I'll pull on their faces with all my might

379
00:21:02.301 --> 00:21:06.001
and confirm whether it's a disguise or not!

380
00:21:06.001 --> 00:21:08.301
Okay, first for...

381
00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:10.901
Mr. Bodyguard, you.

382
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.301
No!

383
00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:15.001
All the people that I hire,

384
00:21:15.001 --> 00:21:18.101
are from that point on, a member of my family!

385
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:19.301
Be it the police or not,

386
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:21.401
I will not have you pushing your weight around!

387
00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:23.501
Oh, no. But...

388
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:29.001
If you insist, show me proof that he's Thief Kid!

389
00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:32.101
At any rate, I'm going to have a meal in my study!

390
00:21:32.101 --> 00:21:34.401
Don't you dare make too much of a fuss!

391
00:21:37.401 --> 00:21:38.501
Darn it!

392
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:41.301
Everything could be made clear only if I get to pull at their faces.

393
00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:44.501
Uncle is sort of acting strange.

394
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:46.701
Because he would usually be all out to get, saying,

395
00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:52.001
"I'll teach that sneaky thief a lesson!"

396
00:21:52.001 --> 00:21:53.601
But, today, he's saying things like,

397
00:21:53.601 --> 00:21:55.301
"Let him be because he's an imposter",

398
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:58.001
"Don't investigate because there's no proof".

399
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:02.301
Maybe Uncle is dear Thief Kid!

400
00:22:02.301 --> 00:22:04.201
No way.

401
00:22:04.201 --> 00:22:07.201
It sure is strange.

402
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:09.401
After all, he did receive a letter of challenge from Kid

403
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:13.001
saying that he may be coming.

404
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:14.401
And yet, he hired new people to work for him.

405
00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:17.001
And, three all together too, at a time like this?

406
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:19.701
Thief Kid's action of sending out that letter of challenge

407
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:22.001
is incomprehensible to begin with too.

408
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:24.601
Even if the first old-fashioned letter that arrived was,

409
00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:28.301
something to make fun of the police.

410
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:30.301
Why would he send a new letter of challenge,

411
00:22:30.301 --> 00:22:31.901
in the form he usually does,

412
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:34.601
on the very day that he's coming to do his thing?

413
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:36.201
Something's fishy.

414
00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:42.601
There's definitely something behind this case.

415
00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:07.601
I wonder who he's disguised as.

416
00:24:07.601 --> 00:24:11.101
That brat said a while ago that,

417
00:24:11.101 --> 00:24:13.401
it's the tanned bodyguard, Goto,

418
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:16.101
the somewhat dense secretary Akitsu

419
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:20.101
and the klutzy maid, Mizuki.

420
00:24:20.101 --> 00:24:23.601
Don't tell me that he's Thief Kid?

421
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:27.001
I'll leave the rest to you, little genius!

422
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.101
Next Conan,

423
00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:34.301
"Thief Kid vs. The Formidable Safe (Part 2)"

424
00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:52.301
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:54.201
"Jirokichi Suzuki"

426
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.701
My dear Thief Kid.

427
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:57.101
That man is the hint.

428
00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:59.301
Dear Thief Kid.
