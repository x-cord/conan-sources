00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.470
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.170
What's going on?

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.370
Yeah...

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.170
You're right.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.870
Lately...

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.970
Ran's been acting strange.

7
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.170
She's oddly excited.

8
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.670
Yeah!

9
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.670
I'm so excited.

10
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.870
Excited? For what?

11
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.670
Anyway...

12
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.570
Dad's home. I have to go.

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.970
I'll see you later.

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.270
I'm hungry.

15
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.070
Make me something for lunch.

16
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.670
There's some cream stew in the kitchen.

17
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.870
You can heat it up and eat it.

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
Okay, then. I'm going out for a bit.

19
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.670
I'll be back this evening.

20
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.270
Sure.

21
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.970
What's she excited about?

22
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.470
We watched that movie with Attorney Kisaki the other day.

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.570
"Worry..."

24
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.970
Her karate tournament is still a long way off,

25
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.670
and the Beika Hotel cake buffet ended yesterday.

26
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.170
She bought a Fusae brand pouch last week.

27
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.170
Darn.

28
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.670
I wish I could call her as Shinichi and find out,

29
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.070
but I'm having Dr. Agasa fix that phone

30
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.470
since it hasn't been working properly.

31
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.870
Hey, let's go.

32
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.370
What? Go where?

33
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.470
We're going to follow Ran and figure out what she's up to.

34
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.870
I know more or less what that is, though.

35
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.570
What?

36
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.270
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

37
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.170
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

38
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.970
Ran is behaving suspiciously.

39
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.070
What will we find when we follow her?

40
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.670
He sees through the one and only truth.

41
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

42
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.670
His name is Detective Conan.

43
00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.869
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 1)"

44
00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.869
She's humming while walking with light steps.

45
00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.269
That must be it.

46
00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.869
She must be planning another trip

47
00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:20.869
with that detective kid who's always missing.

48
00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.169
That jerk...

49
00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.569
How dare he seduce my daughter

50
00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.269
just because he's a smooth talker.

51
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.069
Wait...

52
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.069
It's not me.

53
00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.169
"Beika Bookstore" -Welcome.

54
00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:42.469
What's Ran doing at a bookstore?

55
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.369
"Travel"

56
00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.969
She took a book from the shelf.

57
00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.469
"Kyoto, Highlights Guidebook"

58
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.369
Kyoto?

59
00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:56.669
That detective kid...

60
00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.569
He's planning to shack up with Ran in Kyoto.

61
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.269
It's not me.

62
00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.669
Excuse me.

63
00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.769
My friends will be joining me later.

64
00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:11.169
Could I get a table instead of sitting at the counter?

65
00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.169
You can have this table, then.

66
00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.269
Thank you.

67
00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:17.269
That detective kid...

68
00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.469
He's meeting my daughter at a chic cafe.

69
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.569
I told you, it's not me.

70
00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.169
Excuse me.

71
00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.669
Are you customers?

72
00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:28.869
Yes.

73
00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:36.869
This has happened before.

74
00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:40.069
I think it was when he was watching Yoko Okino and Higo.

75
00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.069
Now I understand how Haibara and the old man felt then.

76
00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:54.069
Who are you so excitedly waiting for, Ran?

77
00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.069
Ran.

78
00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.769
You're already here.

79
00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:01.969
Sera, Sonoko.

80
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.069
Sorry. Were you waiting long?

81
00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.869
No, I just got here.

82
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.869
So, it's just Sonoko and Sera.

83
00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:12.969
Ta-da!

84
00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.969
I bought a guidebook to Kyoto.

85
00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.669
Me, too.

86
00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.169
"Kyoto in Fall"

87
00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.669
It's easier to get information from a book than online

88
00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.869
because of all the nice big photos.

89
00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:29.369
I know what you mean.

90
00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:31.369
Where should we go?

91
00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.269
There are too many options.

92
00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:35.069
-I don't know what to choose. -I don't know what to choose.

93
00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:43.169
Sounds like the girls are going to Kyoto on their break.

94
00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.269
The daughter of the head of Suzuki Financial Group

95
00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:47.969
must be sponsoring their trip.

96
00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.469
Now that we know that, we're done here.

97
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.769
I'll go pay the check.

98
00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:56.969
Get out of here before they notice you.

99
00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:57.969
Okay.

100
00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:01.969
I wonder if we'll get to see Okita.

101
00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.269
What?

102
00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:08.769
As long as we're here, let's get lunch.

103
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.269
I'm starving.

104
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.769
Jeez. Kids are hopeless.

105
00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:18.769
Okita?

106
00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:22.369
It's like they were breaking in a new sword.

107
00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:23.869
Furthermore,

108
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:26.969
this looks like the work of a rather skilled swordsman.

109
00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.269
Who are you?

110
00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:30.569
Who, me?

111
00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.269
I'm Kyoto Senshin High School student,

112
00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:35.369
Soshi Okita.

113
00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.169
You're really cute.

114
00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:43.969
What's your name?

115
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:46.969
Ran Mouri.

116
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:50.169
Ran? That's a nice name.

117
00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.669
You mean that guy who's just like Kudo?

118
00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:54.969
Yeah.

119
00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:57.569
Come to think of it,

120
00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:01.169
he said he lives in Kyoto's Kamigyo Ward.

121
00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.569
Which means...

122
00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:04.869
Is Ran...

123
00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:09.169
going to Kyoto to see Okita?

124
00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:14.969
There's no way.

125
00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:16.769
It's incidental.

126
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:19.569
She's just incidentally meeting Okita on her trip to Kyoto.

127
00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:22.769
Maybe we'll incidentally run into Shinichi, too.

128
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.469
Yeah.

129
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:27.669
Incidental?

130
00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:29.969
Seeing me is incidental?

131
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:35.869
Hold on.

132
00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:40.069
Why is there a chance they'll see me in Kyoto?

133
00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:44.469
Kyoto does crop up in mystery shows a lot,

134
00:08:44.469 --> 00:08:47.569
but surely they don't think I'll show up

135
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.469
when there just happens to be a conveniently timed crime.

136
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.769
Crap!

137
00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.569
Are you okay?

138
00:08:58.569 --> 00:08:59.969
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:59.969 --> 00:09:01.969
I'm glad you're not hurt.

140
00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:06.769
I'll bring you a new iced coffee.

141
00:09:09.869 --> 00:09:11.769
What do you think of this?

142
00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:13.269
Looks good to me.

143
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:14.269
Yeah.

144
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:17.969
Looks like they didn't notice.

145
00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:22.769
What is this?

146
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:25.769
It's so good!

147
00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:28.669
These club sandwiches are good.

148
00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:32.169
Yeah. They're perfectly toasted, too.

149
00:09:32.169 --> 00:09:36.169
But they're not as good as Amuro's.

150
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:38.869
Excuse me.

151
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:42.769
What cafe are you talking about?

152
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:44.069
What?

153
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:46.069
"Daiki Saraie (33), Waiter" -I'd like to try it.

154
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:48.369
If you could please tell me...

155
00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:50.569
It's on 5th street in Beika City.

156
00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:52.869
Don't tell him!

157
00:09:52.869 --> 00:09:56.469
If you tell him, he'll write about it on his blog.

158
00:09:56.469 --> 00:09:59.269
"Toshinori Motosu (38)" -That cafe might have to close down.

159
00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:03.369
I'm on the brink of shutting down my own cafe because of him!

160
00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:08.369
Sir, please don't make fake accusations against me.

161
00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:14.269
I know you're the famous food blogger "the Stuffed Professor"!

162
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:16.369
Give me a break.

163
00:10:16.369 --> 00:10:19.169
If you don't stop now...

164
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.469
I really will destroy you.

165
00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:27.169
I still have a lot of other methods at my disposal.

166
00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:32.069
We lost a lot of customers because you made our chef quit.

167
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:35.669
What's wrong with reducing a rival restaurant's patronage?

168
00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:38.669
I wish you'd call it "business efforts".

169
00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:41.169
Don't forget that the only reason

170
00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:43.769
I haven't crushed you yet

171
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:45.369
is because you're the boss' younger brother.

172
00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:47.869
Saraie.

173
00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:49.069
What is it?

174
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:51.269
"Isuzu Naomura (27), Waiter" -What are you doing?

175
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:54.869
We've got food piling up.

176
00:10:54.869 --> 00:10:56.269
Sorry.

177
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:58.869
I'm finished here. I'll be right there.

178
00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:03.969
Anyway, have you given any thought

179
00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:06.169
to becoming my girlfriend?

180
00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:09.469
I told you I wasn't interested the other day.

181
00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:12.269
The current manager will be retiring when she gets married,

182
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:14.369
and I'm next in line.

183
00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:17.369
You wouldn't have to worry about money again.

184
00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:20.469
I'm not interested in your money.

185
00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:24.269
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:27.969
You changed your hairstyle to escape your debt collectors.

187
00:11:29.669 --> 00:11:32.269
I don't know why you borrowed money,

188
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:35.369
but if you become my girlfriend, I'll protect you.

189
00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:39.169
I've got a lot of influence with those guys.

190
00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:41.269
Hey, you!

191
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.869
"Tamao Hasunuma (40)" -Why are you standing around chatting?

192
00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:47.369
We've got customers waiting to order.

193
00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:49.369
Yes, madam.

194
00:11:49.369 --> 00:11:51.369
Jeez.

195
00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:52.969
Well?

196
00:11:52.969 --> 00:11:55.969
What do you think of our food, Toshinori?

197
00:11:57.469 --> 00:12:00.769
The sandwiches pass,

198
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:03.669
but the stew and pasta are no good.

199
00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:06.169
I'll go to your kitchen to instruct your chefs later.

200
00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:08.169
More importantly...

201
00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:11.669
Can't you do something about that waiter?

202
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:13.969
You mean Saraie,

203
00:12:13.969 --> 00:12:17.069
the waiter you called to complain about the other day.

204
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:21.069
I'll try talking to the owner,

205
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:23.869
but he's his nephew.

206
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:25.669
Anyway, Sister,

207
00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:30.369
I'm surprised you went out with him even for a short while.

208
00:12:30.369 --> 00:12:32.169
Don't remind me!

209
00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:35.869
I'll be marrying a different, better man soon.

210
00:12:37.169 --> 00:12:39.069
Thanks for the food.

211
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:40.869
Thank you.

212
00:12:41.869 --> 00:12:46.069
How about the Kyoto National Museum?

213
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:49.169
They've got all kinds of national treasures on display.

214
00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.969
Really?

215
00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:52.969
Hey, Naomura.

216
00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:54.369
Yes?

217
00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:59.269
One of the big vases we had displayed at the entrance is missing.

218
00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:00.669
Really?

219
00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:04.069
I don't think I saw it when I arrived this morning.

220
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:08.169
Could you look for it?

221
00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:09.469
Sure.

222
00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:13.969
Look. We can even check out the "Gakizoshi" painting.

223
00:13:13.969 --> 00:13:17.269
What? But I don't like scary stuff.

224
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:21.469
But you live with a little imp.

225
00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:23.869
Conan isn't an imp.

226
00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:26.569
Hey, it's the imp!

227
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:29.569
The brat!

228
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:32.369
Dad, what are you doing here?

229
00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:34.669
Well...

230
00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:40.369
It sounded like you were secretly planning a trip.

231
00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:42.869
We followed you because we were curious.

232
00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:44.369
Right?

233
00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:47.769
You're so straightforward.

234
00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:49.569
Secretly?

235
00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:51.869
Are you stupid?

236
00:13:51.869 --> 00:13:56.869
Conan, I'm sure you'll experience this when you get older.

237
00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.769
Experience what?

238
00:13:58.769 --> 00:14:02.769
But this isn't an ordinary trip.

239
00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:04.469
Not ordinary?

240
00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:12.069
What was that scream?

241
00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:15.569
What's going on?

242
00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:18.469
Naomura!

243
00:14:19.969 --> 00:14:20.969
"Changing Room"

244
00:14:20.969 --> 00:14:23.169
Naomura?

245
00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:28.369
Saraie?

246
00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:29.669
What's wrong?

247
00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:33.869
Saraie, wake up!

248
00:14:33.869 --> 00:14:35.569
Saraie!

249
00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:47.736
Saraie!

250
00:14:47.736 --> 00:14:50.536
Saraie, wake up!

251
00:14:50.536 --> 00:14:52.336
Saraie!

252
00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:54.036
Don't touch him!

253
00:14:56.936 --> 00:14:59.236
Let me take a look.

254
00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:00.436
Okay.

255
00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:05.736
Ran, call the police! Hurry!

256
00:15:06.736 --> 00:15:07.836
Okay.

257
00:15:07.836 --> 00:15:09.536
And an ambulance.

258
00:15:09.536 --> 00:15:11.636
Don't bother.

259
00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:14.436
You only need to call the police.

260
00:15:14.436 --> 00:15:16.336
He doesn't have a pulse.

261
00:15:16.336 --> 00:15:18.936
No way...

262
00:15:18.936 --> 00:15:21.536
Who would do this to Saraie?

263
00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:25.236
We don't know who it was yet

264
00:15:25.236 --> 00:15:29.036
but it must've been someone quite strong.

265
00:15:29.036 --> 00:15:32.636
Not only did they club him to death with this giant vase,

266
00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:35.736
but they even broke the padlock on the locker

267
00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:38.036
and stole something.

268
00:15:40.436 --> 00:15:41.836
I see.

269
00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:43.536
A vase, huh?

270
00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:47.936
While searching for the vase that is the murder weapon,

271
00:15:47.936 --> 00:15:51.036
you came to this changing room where you found Saraie's body?

272
00:15:51.036 --> 00:15:52.236
Yes.

273
00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:56.136
The manager asked me to look for it.

274
00:15:56.136 --> 00:15:57.436
Right?

275
00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:59.036
Yes.

276
00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:04.436
One of the two we had displayed by the entrance was missing.

277
00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:08.836
Do you know when the vase went missing?

278
00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:10.036
I'm not sure.

279
00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:14.836
Usually, I'm first to arrive at the cafe and clean.

280
00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:17.936
I think it was gone by then.

281
00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:21.836
I'm the last to leave since I lock up.

282
00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:24.936
The vase was there last night.

283
00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:26.536
I see.

284
00:16:26.536 --> 00:16:30.636
Are you two the only ones with keys to the cafe?

285
00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:37.336
No. Saraie had a key to the entrance, too.

286
00:16:37.336 --> 00:16:42.236
All our cooks have keys to the service entrance.

287
00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:44.436
They've got prep to do.

288
00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.236
Service entrance?

289
00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:48.036
Yes.

290
00:16:48.036 --> 00:16:51.236
It's this door just outside the changing room.

291
00:16:51.236 --> 00:16:54.436
We can't be bothered to unlock and lock it during business hours,

292
00:16:54.436 --> 00:16:55.936
so we leave it unlocked.

293
00:16:55.936 --> 00:17:01.036
Start by questioning all the cooks in the kitchen.

294
00:17:01.036 --> 00:17:03.836
See if they saw anyone enter this changing room immediately

295
00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:06.336
before or after the victim.

296
00:17:06.336 --> 00:17:07.436
Yes, sir.

297
00:17:09.136 --> 00:17:12.736
Did you see anyone from inside the cafe?

298
00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:18.036
We knew about the staff-only entrance since we saw it, but...

299
00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:21.436
But we were chatting at our table.

300
00:17:21.436 --> 00:17:24.436
We weren't watching it carefully.

301
00:17:24.436 --> 00:17:25.736
But...

302
00:17:25.736 --> 00:17:32.136
the detective watching us might have seen something.

303
00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:34.836
I didn't see anything.

304
00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:36.536
Right?

305
00:17:37.936 --> 00:17:40.836
Hey, kid!

306
00:17:40.836 --> 00:17:43.536
They're asking if we saw anything.

307
00:17:45.036 --> 00:17:46.636
Oh, right.

308
00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:50.336
Jeez. I can never tell what you're thinking.

309
00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:54.236
Darn it. What's going on?

310
00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:57.136
I don't have a clue.

311
00:17:58.436 --> 00:18:00.436
Inspector Megure.

312
00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:03.836
I finished questioning the cooks in the kitchen.

313
00:18:03.836 --> 00:18:07.836
Apparently, no one left the kitchen

314
00:18:07.836 --> 00:18:10.536
during the estimated time of death between 1:30 and 2:00.

315
00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:12.136
I see.

316
00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:14.836
Also, the changing room door

317
00:18:14.836 --> 00:18:18.036
can't be seen from the kitchen entrance.

318
00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:22.336
They don't know who entered the changing room during that time.

319
00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:25.936
But a former chef of this restaurant

320
00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:30.136
came to the kitchen to provide instruction.

321
00:18:30.136 --> 00:18:32.536
That's...

322
00:18:32.536 --> 00:18:34.536
my younger brother.

323
00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:37.136
That's correct.

324
00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:39.736
During that time, I came to the kitchen

325
00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:43.636
to provide some cooking instruction at my sister's request,

326
00:18:43.636 --> 00:18:47.736
but I didn't know he was in the changing room.

327
00:18:47.736 --> 00:18:51.536
Besides, I'd never kill anyone.

328
00:18:51.536 --> 00:18:54.036
But...

329
00:18:54.036 --> 00:18:58.536
couldn't you have predicted that the victim would come here?

330
00:18:58.536 --> 00:19:00.436
What?

331
00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:04.236
Right? This room stinks of cigarettes.

332
00:19:04.236 --> 00:19:11.636
There's an ashtray packed full of cigarettes of the same brand.

333
00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:15.936
The victim's mouth smelled strongly of cigarettes.

334
00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:18.536
The victim was a heavy smoker, right?

335
00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:20.036
You must've known he'd show up eventually

336
00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:23.036
if you waited long enough.

337
00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:24.236
Yes.

338
00:19:24.236 --> 00:19:29.236
Saraie's the only employee here who smokes.

339
00:19:29.236 --> 00:19:34.836
The entire staff would've known he came here frequently to smoke.

340
00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:38.436
But the weapon is that vase, right?

341
00:19:38.436 --> 00:19:41.936
It may be hollow, but it seems pretty heavy.

342
00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:45.436
None of our employees could swing that thing around.

343
00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:57.236
She's right. It's about as heavy as a 30kg bag of rice.

344
00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:03.536
If there were water inside, not even I could swing that.

345
00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:10.636
But couldn't a strong man like you do it?

346
00:20:10.636 --> 00:20:12.436
I couldn't do that.

347
00:20:12.436 --> 00:20:15.736
See? Look at this.

348
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:18.436
I dislocated it while playing baseball.

349
00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:23.036
I can't even swing a frying pan in my own restaurant.

350
00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:29.536
Which leaves...

351
00:20:33.436 --> 00:20:36.936
I'm a woman. Is there a problem?

352
00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.036
No...

353
00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:45.336
By the way, that locker with the broken padlock...

354
00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:48.436
Was that the victim's?

355
00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:52.536
Yes, that's Saraie's locker.

356
00:20:52.536 --> 00:20:58.136
Which means the culprit may have been after its contents.

357
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:06.636
It's been badly ransacked.

358
00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:11.136
Do you have any idea what was stolen?

359
00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:14.736
I'm not sure. Only its owner would know for sure.

360
00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:20.636
Why is this the only locker with a padlock?

361
00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:24.836
He's been using it since he started working here.

362
00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:28.536
I did think he was overly cautious.

363
00:21:28.536 --> 00:21:31.436
The culprit really smashed the padlock.

364
00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:33.936
How were they able to break it like this?

365
00:21:35.736 --> 00:21:38.536
Does this cafe have a toolbox?

366
00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:41.036
There's one in those drawers.

367
00:21:46.736 --> 00:21:50.936
I see pliers, a hammer, screwdrivers, and a spanner.

368
00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:55.336
None of those could break a padlock like that.

369
00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:56.536
You're right.

370
00:21:59.436 --> 00:22:03.436
The only other thing in here are these screws and nails.

371
00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.936
Sorry.

372
00:23:54.436 --> 00:23:56.636
"Next Episode" -In that case...

373
00:23:56.636 --> 00:23:59.136
Who did it?

374
00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:00.636
Hey, Ran.

375
00:24:00.636 --> 00:24:02.636
Don't you think he's acting different?

376
00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:03.936
Who is?

377
00:24:03.936 --> 00:24:06.536
Over there. Him.

378
00:24:08.136 --> 00:24:11.236
The brat with the glasses.

379
00:24:11.236 --> 00:24:13.236
What's going on?

380
00:24:13.236 --> 00:24:14.836
You can't figure it out?

381
00:24:14.836 --> 00:24:15.936
No.

382
00:24:15.936 --> 00:24:18.136
I don't have a clue.

383
00:24:19.036 --> 00:24:20.436
Next Conan,

384
00:24:20.436 --> 00:24:24.336
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 2)"

385
00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:27.479
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:27.479 --> 00:24:29.279
"A padlock"

387
00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:30.279
I'm so excited.

388
00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:31.379
I love Kyoto.

389
00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:32.679
And the brat won't be coming.

390
00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.179
Darn it. I'm so curious.
