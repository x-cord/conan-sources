1
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:13,523
I'm really looking forward to the fireflies.

2
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:15,223
I wish they'd hurry up and come.

3
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,223
Yes.

4
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:21,423
"Michitake Owada (47)"

5
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:23,623
Hello, Owada here.

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,223
This is Nakamine speaking.

7
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:28,123
Nakamine, where are you right now?

8
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,823
The firefly song?

9
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,723
Because we're driving carefully,

10
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:36,123
we might arrive later than planned.

11
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,423
But we've passed the Akazawa Bridge,

12
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:40,823
and we'll be there in about 15 minutes.

13
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,023
Is that so?

14
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:45,423
Make sure you guys drive carefully.

15
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:46,923
"Tokurou Nakamine (28)" -I got it.

16
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,223
See you.

17
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:54,723
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

18
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,023
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

19
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,023
Young people crash during a pepping up the village event.

20
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,323
The light of the fireflies shine light on the truth.

21
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,123
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:04,923
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:06,923
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:57,128
"The Fireflies Shine Light on the Truth"

25
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:03,528
He said he'll be here in 15 minutes.

26
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:06,728
I want to see the fireflies quick.

27
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,428
It's almost time.

28
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,228
The fireflies serve as the trump card

29
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:11,828
of this village's sightseeing spot.

30
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:14,228
All of the villagers are counting on them.

31
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,728
The shrine used to gather tourists before.

32
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,228
Yes.

33
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:23,628
People were pretty crazy about the shrine

34
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,128
that's inside the cave.

35
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:30,728
That's why Priest Owada here came up with the idea of breeding fireflies,

36
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:33,628
but it was difficult to raise funds.

37
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:36,628
But you did manage to, right?

38
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:41,228
Yes. It's all thanks to the village head's son, Nakamine.

39
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:44,128
What about the matter regarding Aoi?

40
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,228
Well...

41
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,828
He said that in exchange for his fundraising service,

42
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,828
"Aoi Owada (22)" -he wants to marry my daughter Aoi.

43
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:54,028
And how did Aoi reply?

44
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,628
She gave him the cold shoulder.

45
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:56,728
Nakamine abuses

46
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:59,028
"Tatsuma Kashiwa (26)" -the fact that he's the village head's son,

47
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:02,128
he beats people up and fools around with girls.

48
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,828
But since he's the youth group's leader,

49
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,628
he still helps us at times like this.

50
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:10,728
-Here it comes. -Here it comes.

51
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,228
Alright, let's go.

52
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,028
-Yes. -Let's go.

53
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,228
Hey, turn off the streetlight.

54
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,128
"Shuuichirou Tarumi (26)" -Tarumi,

55
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,628
thanks for the good work.

56
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:33,628
No.

57
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:37,328
-Nakamine, I thank you too. -Tarumi, open it.

58
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,328
Right.

59
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:49,328
Awesome!

60
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,528
Pretty!

61
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:52,928
Amazing.

62
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,428
Unlike the city,

63
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,928
it's dark here so we can see clearly.

64
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:00,928
Yes.

65
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,128
Alright. I'll catch you.

66
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,228
Wait up...

67
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:08,928
Right here...

68
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:16,728
Where'd it go?

69
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:24,228
Where are you, firefly?

70
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:28,628
Did you know?

71
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,928
A firefly's mouth is undeveloped,

72
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,628
so it can only ingest water.

73
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:35,328
Once the nutrient it stored during its larval form is used up,

74
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,728
it dies.

75
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,028
"Officer Narutaki (59)"

76
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,528
Mr. Narutaki, so you're here.

77
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,728
Priest Owada?

78
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,328
How pretty they are.

79
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:54,028
I couldn't help but think how nice it'd be

80
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:56,228
if I could show them to Maya.

81
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,328
Is something wrong?

82
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:11,128
No, it's nothing.

83
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,728
How unfortunate.

84
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:19,628
A landslide struck his house last year.

85
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,728
He lost his family because of that.

86
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,928
You mentioned that in the letter you sent.

87
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,528
About a man who lost his cute granddaughter because of that.

88
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,028
Yes, that was Mr. Narutaki.

89
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,528
He's a local police officer, right?

90
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,528
It really gave me the creeps, the road was narrow...

91
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,628
Where's Nakamine?

92
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:41,528
I want to thank him.

93
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:44,328
Where could he be?

94
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:45,828
Let me call him.

95
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:50,228
Hello?

96
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:52,628
Is this Nakamine? Where are you?

97
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:55,328
What?

98
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,628
Hey, who's over there?

99
00:06:57,628 --> 00:07:00,028
What did Nakamine say?

100
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,628
I don't know.

101
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,828
All he said was,

102
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,128
"I'm at Eboshi Rock, help me." in a painful voice.

103
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:07,428
-What? -Where's this Eboshi Rock?

104
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,028
It's a rock upstream.

105
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,328
Let's take the truck.

106
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,328
Yes.

107
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,728
What's up?

108
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,428
Well, you see...

109
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,328
The key, I can't find the key.

110
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,528
Maybe Mr. Nakamine took it with him.

111
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:59,028
Mr. Nakamine.

112
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,428
Mr. Nakamine, are you there?

113
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:03,728
How is he?

114
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,028
Smells like almond...

115
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:15,228
What? Don't tell me it's cyanide type poison?

116
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,428
Poison?

117
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,128
There's a drink bottle.

118
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:20,828
Was there poison in here?

119
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,028
Fireflies.

120
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:31,428
Let's organize the outline of the case

121
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,528
before the guys from the precinct arrive here to back us up.

122
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,728
The whereabouts of Mr. Nakamine,

123
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:39,128
who came to deliver the fireflies for some reason became unknown.

124
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:41,228
When you, Mr. Tarumi placed a call to him using your cell phone,

125
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,328
he seemed to be struggling with something

126
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,928
and just saying, Eboshi Rock.

127
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:47,428
Someone seems to have been near him.

128
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,728
Yes, sir.

129
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,228
You all rushed over to him

130
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:55,028
but found Mr. Nakmine dead in his own car.

131
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:59,528
But, I don't think Mr. Nakmine could drive.

132
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:02,328
Because it seems that he broke his right leg.

133
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,728
In other words, after letting the fireflies go,

134
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:08,128
he went to Eboshi Rock with someone who drove him there,

135
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:12,028
and was poisoned and killed.

136
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:16,528
Did that firefly get in here when we got in the car?

137
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,628
Who're you people?

138
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,928
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

139
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:28,928
We thought we'd help with the case.

140
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:31,228
Youth Detective Squad?

141
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:32,828
This is not for children.

142
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:34,828
Hurry home and go to bed.

143
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,828
That's why I told you not to.

144
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,028
Mayu.

145
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,128
Grandpa.

146
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:53,328
I'm sure that Mr. Narutaki recalled his grandchild.

147
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:55,328
Even I was surprised too.

148
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,428
A girl named Mayu who looked just like me died in a landslide?

149
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,128
The mountains are becoming more prone to landslides.

150
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:04,228
I think too many trees have been cut.

151
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,528
I always cold sweat when it starts to rain hard.

152
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,228
Father.

153
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:12,128
Aoi, come here for a while.

154
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:16,728
Where were you after the fireflies were released?

155
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:17,928
Where?

156
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:22,628
I don't think so, but were you seeing Mr. Nakamine?

157
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:23,928
I wasn't.

158
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,728
It's that guy after all,

159
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:28,428
so I was worried about what he might do.

160
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,528
Did you hear about Mr. Kashiwa...

161
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,728
I'm telling you, that's not it.

162
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:32,928
What's not it?

163
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,128
Well, what about Mr. Kashiwagi?

164
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:40,328
According to Tarumi,

165
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:42,328
he was really given a bad time.

166
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:44,928
Tatsuma,

167
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,928
if your late father finds out that the number one elite

168
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:50,028
of the village got stingy about donating,

169
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,128
his heart would grieve.

170
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:53,528
Talk softer.

171
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,128
They'll hear you.

172
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,228
This is how loud I normally talk.

173
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:59,628
If the Kashiwagi family is going to go out of their way to help me,

174
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:02,828
it'll make it easier for me to talk to the villagers.

175
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,028
Am I right, Tarumi?

176
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,328
True.

177
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,328
So, you're all it takes to get the people

178
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:09,928
to start an event to pep up the village.

179
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:11,628
My, my...

180
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:13,428
You're the village head's son.

181
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:15,428
Long time no see.

182
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:18,228
It's been so long, Mrs. Kashiwagi.

183
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:20,828
My, it sure has been a long time.

184
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,828
I wonder what he wants.

185
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:25,728
Tatsuma, hurry and invite him in.

186
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:29,828
It seems he was bawled out by his mother later.

187
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:32,628
Saying why doesn't he help with the village revitalisation.

188
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:35,128
She doesn't know

189
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:39,128
that the estate her husband left behind is on the verge of bankruptcy.

190
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:42,328
I'll tell you again,

191
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,228
I don't care if you're childhood friends,

192
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:47,528
I'm against you marrying Mr. Kashiwagi.

193
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:48,928
With a house on the verge of bankruptcy

194
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,528
and a mother whose coming along,

195
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:52,628
I know how tough it will be for you.

196
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:03,628
Watch your step because it's slippery.

197
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:04,928
Okay.

198
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:07,428
It's really strange that there's a shrine inside a cave.

199
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,628
I wonder if there aren't any fireflies here?

200
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,328
Fireflies come this way.

201
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:15,028
"Come, come, come, fireflies..."

202
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:19,028
Come to think of it, back then I heard the firefly song.

203
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,728
Hello, Owada here.

204
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,428
This is Nakamine speaking.

205
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:29,628
Nakamine, where are you right now?

206
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,628
Go for it, Youth Detective Squad!

207
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,128
The police detective is going to scold you again.

208
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:38,228
He's not here, so I'll be fine.

209
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:40,828
He's at the shrine office outside.

210
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,828
Support from the precinct has arrived

211
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,328
and a formal investigation has begun.

212
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,928
Did you find something new?

213
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:50,528
As for the drink bottle,

214
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:54,728
it seems to have been Mr. Nakamine's favourite drink.

215
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,228
The inside of the bottle that was left behind

216
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,728
seems to have been washed thoroughly.

217
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,628
It was washed?

218
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:04,828
Aoi, you're there, aren't you?

219
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:07,628
You can make contact with the shrine office with that.

220
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:11,628
Aoi, a person from the police wants to see you.

221
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:25,128
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

222
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,928
The fact is...

223
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:34,928
We've been asking around from last night to all day today

224
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,628
and have come up with an unfortunate result.

225
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:38,128
What's this?

226
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,828
The chief priest forgot to turn the microphone off.

227
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,928
After the fireflies were released,

228
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:47,128
no one has seen Aoi for 30 minutes.

229
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,128
In other words,

230
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:52,128
she wasn't seen till the time the body of the victim was found.

231
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:54,928
But, Mr. Narutaki, it comes as no surprised

232
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:58,728
that no one saw my daughter in some place dark like that, does it?

233
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:00,528
However, when we checked,

234
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:04,328
everyone acknowledged the presence of everyone else.

235
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,928
Because we bring our faces close together

236
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,228
when watching the fireflies.

237
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,228
I mean, we've only got very little space.

238
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,928
The only people none of us saw are

239
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,828
Ms. Aoi Owada and one more person.

240
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:19,328
The same goes for me too.

241
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:22,528
Mr. Nakamine was all for Aoi,

242
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,728
so if she asked him to come

243
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:26,828
he would go without any doubts to Eboshi Rock with her.

244
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:29,428
And if she gave him the poisoned drink there.

245
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,428
It would apply to me too, then.

246
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:37,228
But, I don't think Mr. Nakamine would open his heart to you.

247
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:40,528
Either way, I'm in safe zone.

248
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:41,828
Thank god.

249
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:44,928
Not too fast.

250
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:47,928
You're still a suspect.

251
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,628
I hear Mr. Nakamine was angry

252
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:54,328
that you stole the money for catching the fireflies.

253
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,928
No... That's not true at all.

254
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,328
It was a misunderstanding.

255
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,628
I explained everything and Nakamine understood.

256
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:02,828
Genta, where did you get that flashlight?

257
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:06,428
You had it with you since last night, right?

258
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:09,128
I forgot to return it...

259
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:12,428
It was in the truck that brought the fireflies.

260
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,928
Will you show that to me?

261
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,328
Why?

262
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:19,228
If I remember correctly, back then...

263
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:23,928
-Nakamine, I thank you too. -Tarumi, open it.

264
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:28,328
I see. That's the story.

265
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:42,192
Aoi, do you have anything to say?

266
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,192
You do have something to say.

267
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,392
Mr. Agasa.

268
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:55,592
Don't worry, Mr. Owada, your daughter is not the culprit.

269
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:58,892
Amateurs keep out of this.

270
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,392
It'll be over soon.

271
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:05,092
So long as you disclose the crime that Mr. Tarumi committed.

272
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:07,792
What's this about the crime I committed?

273
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,292
You're the one, aren't you?

274
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:12,692
The one who killed Mr. Nakamine with the poisoned drink?

275
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:14,692
Cut out the joke please.

276
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:18,692
When Mr. Nakamine died, I was with all of you, right?

277
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,892
You put on an act saying that Mr. Nakamine died

278
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,492
while you were on the phone with him,

279
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:26,692
because Mr. Nakamine was already dead at that time.

280
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:27,892
What?

281
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,792
Wait a second.

282
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,492
I was with my friends all the while

283
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,992
after releasing the fireflies.

284
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,692
Just when did I ever go to Eboshi Rock?

285
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:39,692
Before you released the fireflies.

286
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:42,092
You received a call from Mr. Nakamine

287
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,692
while on your way to delivering the fireflies

288
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:47,292
but didn't you hear the melody of the firefly song

289
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,892
from the telephone then?

290
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,092
That's right.

291
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,992
It was a tune that came from the 1cent candy store

292
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:56,492
on the way to Eboshi Rock.

293
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,792
In other words, back then,

294
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:03,292
Mr. Nakamine was in the truck that Mr. Tarumi was driving

295
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:06,492
and heading towards Eboshi Rock.

296
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,392
He let Mr. Nakamine off at Eboshi Rock,

297
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:12,192
and came to the riverside alone.

298
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:13,892
That can't be

299
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:18,392
because we heard Mr. Nakamine's voice when the fireflies were released.

300
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:21,492
That was just a simple trick.

301
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,192
This is what he used.

302
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:28,592
What? It's just a flashlight.

303
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,692
In fact, this is...

304
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,992
Hey, turn off the streetlight.

305
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:37,092
This is...

306
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:39,192
Tarumi, open it.

307
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,292
This is a flashlight type voice recorder.

308
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:45,892
You used this to make it look like

309
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:48,392
you were conversing with Mr. Nakamine, weren't you?

310
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:53,492
I see, that's why he didn't answer when I called him.

311
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,192
Exactly.

312
00:17:55,192 --> 00:18:00,092
Mr. Tarumi, when you were heading for Eboshi Rock with the truck

313
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,992
you looked inside the truck and seemed strangely flustered.

314
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,792
That's because you couldn't find this,

315
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,792
that was supposed to be in the truck.

316
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:12,692
The fact is that one of the children inadvertently took it.

317
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,992
You probably said the following to Mr. Nakamine.

318
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,992
Aoi wants to see you,

319
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:22,292
but she doesn't want her father to find out about this.

320
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,092
Therefore, you told him to establish an alibi

321
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:27,192
and sneak over to Eboshi Rock.

322
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,792
Mr. Nakamine was completely deceived.

323
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,592
He had you take him to Eboshi Rock,

324
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:34,592
and recorded his own voice in the voice recorder,

325
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,592
to use it to establish his alibi.

326
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:39,992
Then he waited for Aoi in his own car

327
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:42,092
that he had taken to Eboshi Rock beforehand.

328
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:45,992
You then, handed him the poisoned drink.

329
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:52,892
He drank the drink while waiting for Aoi, and died.

330
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,292
Nonsense!

331
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,092
If I went to Eboshi Rock before releasing the fireflies,

332
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:00,492
why were fireflies flying around in the car?

333
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,492
Just because you wanted to say this,

334
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:05,992
you released the firefly in the car.

335
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,992
When and how?

336
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,692
Very audacious indeed.

337
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:15,892
You got to the victim's car just a bit earlier than me.

338
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,092
That's when you switched

339
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,792
the bottle with the poison in it

340
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,492
to the one with firefly inside it.

341
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,992
The bottle was washed thoroughly

342
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:28,392
to put firefly inside it.

343
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,092
Let's hear you out at the station.

344
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:40,592
Aoi!

345
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:43,892
Mr. Tatsuma!

346
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:51,892
-Ai! -Mayu!

347
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,392
Ai!

348
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:01,492
What's that sound?

349
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,692
It's a landslide.

350
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,392
Are you all alright?

351
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,892
Yes.

352
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,992
-We're fine. -Where's Ai?

353
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,592
Over here.

354
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:29,592
Darn.

355
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,792
Tarumi!

356
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,192
Cut out doing stupid things.

357
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,792
You have nowhere to escape.

358
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:37,792
Shut up.

359
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,392
-Mayu! -Ai!

360
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,392
What?

361
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:44,992
Fireflies, fireflies!

362
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,692
Who cares about fireflies?

363
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,092
I wouldn't say that.

364
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,892
Fireflies in here are just proof

365
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:52,492
that there's a way out of here, right?

366
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:53,992
I see.

367
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,992
Okay, this side.

368
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,092
-Mayu. -Hey.

369
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,492
If you move, this kid dies.

370
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:06,892
There're two fireflies now.

371
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,592
No.

372
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:11,092
It's just the reflection in the water of the puddle.

373
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:12,892
I'm sure Ai noticed it.

374
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:23,492
You brat.

375
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,592
Mayu!

376
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:28,992
Darn.

377
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,492
We did it.

378
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:48,792
Are you okay, Mayu?

379
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,292
Mayu!

380
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:53,092
I'm not Mayu.

381
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,392
But, thank you.

382
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,092
I'm glad.

383
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:06,592
I'm really glad.

384
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:34,692
Tarumi's motive for murder

385
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:37,592
was not only because he used the money that was to be used for fireflies,

386
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,792
but also because he was embezzling money

387
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,892
from Mr. Nakamine's father's company,

388
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,492
and because what he was doing was about to come to light.

389
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,892
I was worried about how things would turn out at one point,

390
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,592
but all that ends well is well.

391
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,392
You can say that again.

392
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:59,792
They seem to be doing good too.

393
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,892
I guess so.

394
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,392
A purse snatcher?

395
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:12,492
I said hold it!

396
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:16,292
Someone you knew?

397
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:19,892
I'm sure he had a burn mark on his right eye.

398
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,992
I don't remember a guy like that during the bus-jack.

399
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,592
During the bus-jack he didn't have a burn.

400
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:27,192
I think he was wearing a black knitted cap

401
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,692
and a mask over his mouth.

402
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:31,492
What?

403
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:32,892
Next Conan,

404
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:36,266
"A Red Omen that Summons Danger"

405
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:54,478
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:56,478
"Reading glasses".

407
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,478
In the next episode, there's going to be a big fuss over a lottery ticket.

408
00:24:58,478 --> 00:25:00,778
It's may be attractive, but this program starts at 6 pm, don't forget.
