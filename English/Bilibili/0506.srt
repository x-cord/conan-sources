1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,140
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,340
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,040
And start the countdown to deduction and the future!

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,640
Lawyer Eri Kisaki and renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,540
The confrontation of destiny of a separated couple.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,640
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:02,317
On our way to pick up Attorney at Law Eri Kisaki, Ran's mother,

10
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:04,317
in order to go to dinner together,

11
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:08,617
we discover the dead body of a popular wrestler, Mr. Shiro Eisaku.

12
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,017
From what's seen of the dead body,

13
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:13,717
it seems that he had been killed

14
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,517
while getting a hair cut at a barber or a beauty shop.

15
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,617
It turns out that Ms. Minayo Hasaka

16
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,517
"Minayo Hasaka (29)" -who runs a beauty salon in the neighbourhood

17
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,517
used to be Mr. Eisaku's ex-girlfriend,

18
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:27,017
so she ends up being one of the suspects.

19
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,617
However, at the estimated time,

20
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,117
the murder was thought to have been committed,

21
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,217
Minayo happens to be doing Eri's hair.

22
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,317
Besides, if Minayo were to be the killer,

23
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:37,917
how could she have moved a dead body weighing 90 kilograms

24
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:39,417
to the trash dump?

25
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:43,417
And, what were the three sounds "crash, thud and rattle-rattle"

26
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:48,017
that we heard when the dead body was found?

27
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:56,917
"Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony (Part 2)"

28
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,017
Conan!

29
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:02,117
Everybody's leaving, let's go too!

30
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:03,517
Okay!

31
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:17,017
What're those desks and chairs?

32
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:19,217
Maybe over-sized items that are to be disposed of are gathered there,

33
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:20,617
so that they can be picked up

34
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,617
during the next over-sized items trash collection day?

35
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:27,217
Minayo sure is scrupulous, isn't she?

36
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:28,617
Because, look...

37
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:31,917
She has the old newspapers and magazines all separated,

38
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,517
and all the cardboard boxes are nicely folded compactly and tied together.

39
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:36,817
Come on, let's go!

40
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,417
Okay!

41
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,117
Why...

42
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:51,217
You drove through this narrow back road on your scooter?

43
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:54,217
Yes. There's usually nobody here, so...

44
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,517
What's with him calling me repeatedly?

45
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:02,617
-Don't you have to answer the call? -Huh?

46
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,817
I'll bet it's one of your beautiful woman childhood friends.

47
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,517
Yeah, sorry, so what!

48
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:12,017
Oh boy! Why does it always turn out like this?

49
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,617
It's the convenience store over there.

50
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,417
It's opposite the trash dump where the body was found.

51
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,717
The traffic sign pole...

52
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,617
It's dusted off and there are thin lines on it.

53
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,617
What are these lines?

54
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:38,617
Cigarette butts and trash are collected in one place.

55
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:41,617
Why?

56
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,217
Is this the place?

57
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,117
The trash dump next to the convenience store

58
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:51,617
that you came to throw out your trash?

59
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:53,117
Yes.

60
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:56,217
What do you guys want?

61
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:58,217
You work for this convenience store?

62
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,317
Yes.

63
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,817
We're the police.

64
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:04,517
Huh? The police?

65
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:08,817
Just a while ago, I heard that something happened in the neighbourhood.

66
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,817
Yes. Regarding that incident,

67
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:14,417
I wonder if you can tell me what time she came here tonight?

68
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,917
Huh? What is this? Are they suspecting you, Minayo?

69
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,017
-Yes. -Well, we're just confirming things.

70
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:26,817
I think it was at about 20:30.

71
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,717
I guess I can check the receipt and tell you for sure!

72
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:32,917
Because Minayo's the only customer who bought a bag of rice tonight!

73
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:38,917
It says 20:28.

74
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:43,817
Do you know how long she was here back then?

75
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:46,117
About 4 to 5 minutes, I think.

76
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,817
I guess we can check the surveillance camera.

77
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:53,217
Then, I guess she couldn't have committed the murder after all.

78
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:57,717
She left me saying that she had something to do at 20:20.

79
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:01,117
After doing what she had to do, she came back at 20:30.

80
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:05,817
She came to this convenience store between 20:23 to 20:24,

81
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:09,217
If she left after finishing shopping at 20:28...

82
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,717
The time she could've used to commit the crime

83
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,417
would be 3 to 4 minutes before going to the convenience store

84
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:16,317
and 2 minutes after leaving the store.

85
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:21,417
It's too short a time to carry the dead body over to the trash dump!

86
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,017
When she came here tonight,

87
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,517
she was carrying a trash bag, wasn't she?

88
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:31,017
Yes, 2 to 3 bags.

89
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:34,817
Maybe one of the bags had a dead body in it, and not trash?

90
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:35,817
Dead body?

91
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:38,117
Please, dear...

92
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:39,917
No, I guess you want to say that

93
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:43,217
she carried the dead body over with the scooter, but that's not possible!

94
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,317
Impossible?

95
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:48,017
Because Minayo's scooter is so junk

96
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:51,117
that the engine stopped before she came to the store!

97
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:52,817
-It stopped? -Yes.

98
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:57,217
Just when I went out to throw out the trash, in front of the store.

99
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,017
Just as Minayo was coming out of the back road

100
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,817
where her house is to where she came out to this road just about here.

101
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:03,217
I saw it jerk to a halt!

102
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:05,617
After that, you got off your scooter

103
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:08,517
and came here pushing it along, right?

104
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:11,517
Yes. But it started to move after a while,

105
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:13,517
so I drove it back home.

106
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,817
Now you know, that she's not the one!

107
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,317
She's my precious beautician,

108
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:22,017
so will you please stop hassling her?

109
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,417
Right, good work.

110
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:29,817
Protect me good, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

111
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:34,717
Huh? There's blonde hair stuck by your stomach, Miss!

112
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,817
No... no way?

113
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,917
I made sure I changed clothes.

114
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,617
Another good look and it's brown hair!

115
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:46,117
It's Ms. Kisaki's hair!

116
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:49,017
Yes.

117
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,817
The way she just reacted...

118
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,817
She's the killer after all.

119
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,717
But I can't figure it out.

120
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,817
From Minayo's beauty shop

121
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:59,717
to the trash dump where the dead body was found,

122
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,917
it's true that it's very close if in a straight line.

123
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,317
But she went shopping at the convenience store

124
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,417
that's opposite the trash dump.

125
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:12,717
If so, the time left for her to commit the crime is really slight.

126
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,817
With just so little time left, how did she move

127
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,917
the body of a man who weighs 90 kilograms?

128
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,217
You're hurt after all!

129
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,517
Hurt?

130
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,317
I wonder where I got hurt?

131
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,917
Remember, when dad slammed on the brakes...

132
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:35,017
I get it! Sudden braking!

133
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:50,817
If my deduction is correct,

134
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,817
it should be somewhere here.

135
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:59,117
Just as I thought, after all.

136
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:01,317
I've figured everything out!

137
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:06,517
A dreadful trick that sent a man on a death...

138
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:09,817
plunge to the pits of hell!

139
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,617
Not again.

140
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:21,017
Like I've been saying for some time already.

141
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:24,017
Ms. Hasaka couldn't have committed the crime!

142
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:25,817
But, Ms. Kisaki...

143
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:30,717
The fact that Ms. Hasaka was not with you between 20:10 to 20:30

144
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:34,717
which is the estimated time of death,

145
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:36,617
for some reason really bothers me.

146
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:41,117
Right, right. Ms. Hasaka is after all his ex-girlfriend, too.

147
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:44,317
That's irrelevant right now, isn't it?

148
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,117
The image on the surveillance camera also shows that

149
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:52,817
she was unmistakably in the shop for 4 minutes between 20:24 and 20:28.

150
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,717
The only time she had to commit the crime

151
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:58,017
was 4 minutes from 20:20 to 20:24

152
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:01,017
and 2 minutes from 20:28 to 20:30!

153
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,317
Just how do you propose that she carry

154
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:07,317
the dead body of a man who weighs 90 kilograms

155
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,917
to the trash dump that is two slopes below?

156
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:13,617
Or, is it that you're giving her a hard time

157
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,617
because she's my beautician?

158
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,617
Don't be ridiculous!

159
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,317
Hey, mom!

160
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,417
You're taking it a bit too far!

161
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:34,017
Dad actually came here today to come pick you up, you know?

162
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:37,317
I knew that to begin with.

163
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:40,917
Then, why?

164
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:44,017
It just annoys me that,

165
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:47,217
that guy doesn't bother to say a word about it to me!

166
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:50,717
Then, why didn't you ask him yourself and say,

167
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,617
"Did you come to pick me up?"

168
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:54,617
What're you talking about?

169
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:57,917
Are you telling me to win the favor of that mustached chauvinist?

170
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:01,517
No way!

171
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:03,517
Gosh.

172
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:07,017
-Ms. Hasaka. -Yes.

173
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:11,417
May I have your permission to check inside your house, just to be sure?

174
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,817
What? But...

175
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,917
No way!

176
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:19,617
Under Article 35 of the Constitution!

177
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,217
The right of all persons to be secure

178
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:23,117
in their homes, papers and effects against entries,

179
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:27,917
searches and seizures shall not be impaired,

180
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:33,217
except upon warrant issued for adequate cause

181
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:39,417
and particularly describing the place to be searched and things to be seized!

182
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,617
If you insist on investigating,

183
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,017
please do so after getting an arrest, search or seizure warrant

184
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:47,717
from a competent judicial officer, will you?

185
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:50,117
But...

186
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:51,717
Well, with circumstances showing that

187
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,017
she couldn't have committed the murder,

188
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:56,117
it would be hard to get what's needed though.

189
00:11:56,117 --> 00:12:00,717
Good. Very well done, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

190
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,017
I was perfectly correct

191
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:06,417
in choosing you as the one to testify my alibi.

192
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,817
Okay, you want me to prove it?

193
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:12,917
That she too, could've committed the murder.

194
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,717
My, you sure sound like you're ready to prove it?

195
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:24,317
Oh, no, well, it's not me, you see...

196
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,717
-It's... -Come!

197
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:40,317
-Sleeping Kogoro! -Sleeping Kogoro!

198
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:45,217
I'm glad I had Dr. Agasa make me a spare voice changer bow-tie.

199
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:47,017
Hold it!

200
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,917
Didn't you just say, "It's not me" or something like that?

201
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,617
So... I was going to say,

202
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:58,117
it doesn't have to be me explain this super simple trick!

203
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:00,517
The simple trick that Ms. Hasaka used, first killing Mr. Eisaku

204
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:04,917
then throwing him out in the trash dump two slopes below!

205
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,870
Inspector!

206
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,870
Will you please get ready a strong fishing line used for big catch

207
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,770
as well as cement bags that can be used as substitute for the victim?

208
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,870
-Officer Takagi, get them ready, will you? -Yes, sir!

209
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,470
And before we start, please take some pictures first.

210
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,770
Some pictures?

211
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,170
Take a picture of the stand of the guard rail

212
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,770
right above the trash dump where the body was found

213
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,170
and the tiny thin lines that are on the pillar of the traffic sign

214
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,070
that is around the corner on the way to the convenience store,

215
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,470
as well as the little amount of trash that is gathered in a circle

216
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,270
on the road near the traffic sign!

217
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,870
Mr. Mouri, everything's ready.

218
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,970
Let's begin, then.

219
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,370
First, please put down the chair that is on the desk over there.

220
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,170
The first thing that bothered me was that chair.

221
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,270
The height of the chair is set as the highest it can go.

222
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,970
Yes, true.

223
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,070
Minayo seems to be a scrupulous character

224
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,570
judging from the way she separates old newspapers

225
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,070
and old magazines like they should be,

226
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,070
as well as folds cardboard boxes compactly and ties them together.

227
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,870
Nonetheless, it bothered me that

228
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,570
only that chair was left as is, at its highest position.

229
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,670
I guess I just happened to overlook it.

230
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,670
No! In order to make your trick work,

231
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,970
you needed to keep the chair at its highest position!

232
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,770
I'll redo the trick for you right now!

233
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,170
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

234
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,170
First, tie the fishing line that you got ready

235
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,470
onto the spindle of the chair!

236
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,470
Make sure you tie it on tightly

237
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,170
so that it doesn't come off even after pulling on it!

238
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,570
Next pass the tip of the line

239
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,070
through the other side of the pillar of the guard rail

240
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,270
where the trash dump where the dead body was found

241
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,670
is in view right ahead below and come back.

242
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,270
Then adjust the length of the line from the chair to the guard rail

243
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,670
to almost the same as the distance from the back of the beauty salon

244
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,470
to the road where the convenience store is,

245
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,770
and tie it on to the scooter that is parked at the backdoor.

246
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,970
All done!

247
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,170
Then, please tie another line to the back of the scooter,

248
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,870
but this time, make the length of the line

249
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,970
a little longer than the distance

250
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,470
from the guard rail to the road leading out to the convenience store

251
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,170
and tie it on to the spindle of the chair.

252
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,770
Then finally place the bags of cement on the chair

253
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,470
as substitute for the dead body and all is set!

254
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,770
All that's left to do is

255
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,270
to head for the convenience store on that scooter.

256
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,270
Hey, are you ready over on that side?

257
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,270
Yes, sir!

258
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,470
Just as you ordered, all the onlookers have been evacuated!

259
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,070
Okay, I got it!

260
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,970
Officer Takagi!

261
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,970
Yes, sir!

262
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,670
At first, go slow so that the cement bag doesn't fall off

263
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,870
and gradually accelerate!

264
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,570
All right, sir!

265
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,770
Inspector Megure!

266
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,270
The cement bag fell into the trash dump!

267
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,770
Okay!

268
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,870
If the chair crashes into the guard rail with force,

269
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,370
through the law of inertia,

270
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,770
the dead body that is on the chair should fly off

271
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,570
and fall into the trash dump two slopes below.

272
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,370
Then from the impact of the crash,

273
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,370
the first line that was tied is severed.

274
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,470
If the scooter is pushed as is, all the way to the convenience store,

275
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,270
the chair is pulled with the line that was tied on later

276
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,670
and is returned to the back road where it was to begin with.

277
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,070
The law of inertia...

278
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:15,170
So, the crash, thud and rattle-rattling sounds that we heard were these.

279
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,970
The thin lines on the guard rail and the traffic sign were marks

280
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,570
left behind by the line scrapping against them.

281
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,470
But if the dead body were to be seated on the chair,

282
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,470
wouldn't its legs be sandwiched between the guard rail

283
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,370
so that it wouldn't fly all that far?

284
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,070
In order for that not to happen,

285
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,370
the victim was probably seated cross-legged.

286
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,570
The seat was probably adjusted to the highest possible position

287
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,270
to avoid the dead body from getting stuck by the guard rail.

288
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,670
Then, what about the trash that was gathered in a circle on the road?

289
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,470
When Minayo came back from the convenience store,

290
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,570
the line that she was dragging along scrapped

291
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,170
and gathered the trash on the road.

292
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,570
The scooter stopped moving suddenly

293
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,270
because the chair bumped into the guard rail causing it to stop.

294
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,970
Do you have proof?

295
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,070
Proof that I killed him!

296
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,270
It's so rude to treat me as if I were a killer

297
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,870
despite having no proof.

298
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,070
Isn't it, Ms. Kisaki?

299
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,070
The evidence is most probably...

300
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,370
Oh no! He got up at the worst timing!

301
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,070
And, where's the proof?

302
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,370
Proof?

303
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,070
Civil Code Article 239!

304
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,770
Ownership of movables without an owner

305
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,070
shall be acquired by possessing the same with the intention to own!

306
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,170
In other words, trash that is once thrown into the trash dump

307
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,270
becomes the possession of whoever finds the trash necessary.

308
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,970
Maybe if we have them check the trash

309
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,670
that you threw out on the way to the convenience store,

310
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,570
everything will come to light?

311
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,970
If you're the killer, you would most probably want to

312
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,170
dispose of the blood smeared cape and towel

313
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,870
as soon as you possibly can, right?

314
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,070
Judging from the looks of it,

315
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,770
I don't think we need to do further checking.

316
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,470
It's so sad

317
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,170
to think that you would use me to establish your alibi.

318
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,870
You probably called Mr. Eisaku over to your house before I came,

319
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,070
and used the 10 minutes that was needed

320
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,770
to set the dye into my hair to kill Mr. Eisaku.

321
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,570
Then you used the trick explained just now

322
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,070
to throw the dead body over.

323
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,770
When you retrieved the line,

324
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,570
you forgot to adjust the height of the chair

325
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,270
to its original low position, in your haste.

326
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,870
You threw the dead body into the trash dump

327
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,770
because you wanted someone to find it quickly,

328
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,170
so that the span of the estimated time of death wouldn't be too great.

329
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,570
You held that bad a grudge against Mr. Eisaku, eh?

330
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,570
I don't hate him that much.

331
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,870
I hated the RV talent who got engaged to him.

332
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,770
She had the nerve to lure him into having an engagement with her

333
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,270
during the time that he and I were having a fight

334
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,870
and decided not to see each other for a while. It's her that I hate!

335
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,270
Then, why did you kill him?

336
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,770
Do you know?

337
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,470
When he first debut as a wrestler, he had short black hair.

338
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,970
That woman's the one who changed his hair

339
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,270
to blonde medium length hair.

340
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,770
I just couldn't stand myself

341
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,670
doing as that woman ordered.

342
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,370
I couldn't stand him watching contentedly

343
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,370
while she did as she pleased.

344
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,170
You should've refused then.

345
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,770
When I became a beautician,

346
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,170
I promised that I would cut his hair through his entire life!

347
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,270
Yes. I didn't want to let anyone cut his hair.

348
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,670
Nor, did I want to cut his hair myself either.

349
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,570
So, I had no choice but to do what I did.

350
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,270
Well, we'll hear the rest of your story at the Police Department.

351
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,370
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

352
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,170
Ms. Kisaki, you'd better be careful too.

353
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,070
You're fighting with him over trivial matters.

354
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,170
Being stubborn with each other

355
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,170
may lead to irredeemable consequences.

356
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,270
Come on, let's go.

357
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,570
It's really too bad that I won't be able to hear any more

358
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,870
lovey-dovey stories of you and your husband!

359
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,470
Lovey-dovey?

360
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,470
No! It's not what you think.

361
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,070
It's not lovey-dovey stories.

362
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,670
Is that true?

363
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,270
You idiot! Of course not.

364
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,470
Is it true?

365
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,770
Yes, it's true!

366
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,170
Does it bother you?

367
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,670
You really won 1 million 200 thousand yen betting on a dark horse?

368
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,870
-What? -Well, congratulations!

369
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,670
We must toast to your win tonight!

370
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,870
What? You're drinking already?

371
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,770
I'll be right over! Hold on!

372
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,370
That phone call just now?

373
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,570
It was from one of my horse racing buddies

374
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,170
that kept calling me from some time ago.

375
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,470
He kept calling persistently

376
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,670
because he wanted me to join him drinking in celebration of the win!

377
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,570
Huh? What?

378
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,670
Who cares!

379
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,670
And? What with the case?

380
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,570
Who cares.

381
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,970
Who cares, same here.

382
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,370
"Next Episode"

383
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,770
Eisuke, you've come back to school!

384
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,870
Yeah! Just today.

385
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,370
I've no idea who he is,

386
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,170
but the only thing I can guess is...

387
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,570
He's the FBI investigator who's been tailing Eisuke.

388
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,070
Don't tell me, he...

389
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,270
Next Conan, "The Blind Spot of the Karaoke Booth (Part 1)"

390
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,270
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,770
"Eisuke Hondo"

392
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,570
The stage for the next episode is at a Karaoke booth.

393
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,170
I may sing off tune, but my deductions are never off.
