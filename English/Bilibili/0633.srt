1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,540
The timekeeper sends a threat letter.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,240
The contents warn that Mrs. Rukako Hoshina,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,840
owner of the Building of Clocks,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,840
will be killed during her birthday.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,440
We were invited to the party

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,040
along with Pops who was asked to protect her.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,840
But at the ring of the 6:00 chime,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,540
she ended up being killed by someone.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,440
The culprit seems to have stabbed Rukako's chest

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,740
with a sharp object like an ice pick

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,440
and fled from the balcony.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,540
However, the weird thing was that no footprints

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,640
were left on the ground that was wet with rain.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,340
A life was also lost at her birthday party

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,140
that was held at the Hoshina residence four years ago.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,240
A clock technician who was repairing the grand clock fell,

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,340
but the search for his body was delayed because of her party.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,940
Ran is terrified

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,540
that the Timekeeper is the ghost of the clock technician that died,

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,440
but she's wrong.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,840
I'll reveal the true identity of the culprit at all cost!

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,140
Like the fog clears.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,040
Let's see through love and crime as well!

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
A blackmail warning that time will be stopped is delivered.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,140
Fear sweeps through the birthday party.

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,940
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,781
"The Blade of the Timekeeper (Part 2)".

30
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,481
So you're an architect.

31
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,781
I'm Karube,

32
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,081
the one who designed this building.

33
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:11,481
Your hands and sleeves have blood on them.

34
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,081
It probably got there

35
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,981
when I ran over to Mrs. Hoshina who fell to the floor.

36
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:19,681
But there's no blood anywhere else is there?

37
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,881
No.

38
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:22,881
And? Is there anything

39
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:25,281
that you noticed at the time of the crime?

40
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:26,881
Come to think of it,

41
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,281
"Karube Teigo (45)" -I think I heard something like cloth

42
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:30,881
"Architect" -being rubbed against something approaching,

43
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,281
so the culprit could be a woman who is wearing a dress.

44
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:38,481
By the way, the mouthpiece of your pipe

45
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,881
also looks long and sharp.

46
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:43,481
Is it all right if I check it?

47
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:48,081
Hey! Enough already!

48
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:50,081
It's true that the clock technician who died four years ago

49
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,381
was my older brother,

50
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,381
so I have the most motive to be the killer

51
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,781
but that was an unfortunate accident!

52
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,681
I had no grudge against Mrs. Hoshina.

53
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:04,281
But you were given charge of decorating the interior of this building.

54
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:07,581
Therefore, you could've rigged this place any way you wanted to.

55
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,781
"Suou Chiaki (39)" -As to that, Mr. Karube the architect,

56
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:12,781
"Interior Designer" -as well as Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

57
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,281
would also be in the same boat.

58
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:18,681
But I guess Mr. Furugaki who is quite aged shouldn't be included.

59
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,281
Why not?

60
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,881
The culprit after stabbing Mrs. Hoshina,

61
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:27,181
went pass my left side quite swiftly!

62
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:32,181
So, see, there is a smear of blood on my left arm, isn't there?

63
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:35,381
By the way, the thing that you're wearing in your hair...

64
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,081
This is a hairpin that my older brother bought for me some time ago.

65
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,681
May I check it, please?

66
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,081
You can check it all you want!

67
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,481
I mean it's not a samurai movie or anything,

68
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:53,481
so I couldn't possibly have a sword or the like on me.

69
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,781
I guess not.

70
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,481
It was you, wasn't it?

71
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,781
The clock technician that made that grand clock.

72
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:02,881
Yeah, I'm Furugaki.

73
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:04,681
Your right shoulder

74
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,881
seems to have a bit of splattered blood on it.

75
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,281
"Furugaki Rinsaku (64), Clock Technician"

76
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:13,081
It seems that woman was stabbed to my right, so...

77
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,681
I could care less,

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,781
but I think the culprit is someone who is quite fat.

79
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,481
Just before that woman screamed,

80
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:25,881
I was pushed by a soft resilient body.

81
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,281
It... it's true that I'm 78 kilograms,

82
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,081
and a little plump,

83
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,281
but does that have anything to do with the incident?

84
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,881
No, this is just in case.

85
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,981
By the way, Mr. Oume,

86
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:45,481
about this knife beside the cake...

87
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:48,281
Your fingerprints have been detected on it.

88
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,281
"Oume Gakumichi (42)" -Of course!

89
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:51,781
"Hoshina Family Butler" -As a steward,

90
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:55,081
my job is to cut the cake, you see.

91
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,981
After the candle lights went out,

92
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,781
the lights weren't turned on immediately,

93
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:00,381
why?

94
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,781
That's because Mrs. Hoshina didn't signal for the lights to be turned on.

95
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,081
If as usual, after she blows out the candles,

96
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,581
the 6:00 bell would ring.

97
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,081
After it rings,

98
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,781
Mrs. Hoshina snaps her fingers to signal the lights to be turned on,

99
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,481
and that's when they're turned on.

100
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,181
But back then,

101
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:19,481
the clock didn't ring right away either, did it?

102
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,781
No.

103
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,781
Although the three who were glued to the clocks

104
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,581
that were about to be delayed,

105
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:28,181
all said that the clocks rang on time.

106
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,681
More than that,

107
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,881
you seem to have been close to Mrs. Hoshina

108
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,081
and yet, no blood is splattered on you.

109
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,981
Maybe it's because the culprit was a big person?

110
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,981
That's why no blood is splattered on me.

111
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:49,881
A person wearing a dress who can move swiftly, but is hefty and big...

112
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:53,181
Was there such a person among the guests?

113
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,281
No.

114
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,381
65 guests came to the party.

115
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:59,381
We checked them all, but there was no such person.

116
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,381
Besides, there were no guests that had anything

117
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,481
that looked to be a weapon on them either.

118
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,681
Yes.

119
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,681
Well, it seems that no luminol reaction was found

120
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,581
from the belongings of the four.

121
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:12,281
In other words, just as the threat letter put it,

122
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:16,181
it was an "invisible blade" that committed the murder.

123
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,081
I guess so.

124
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,381
The blood that was on the railing and the window frame

125
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,081
was Mrs. Hoshina's, right?

126
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,281
Yeah.

127
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,181
I don't know how the culprit got Mrs. Hoshina's blood on the railing

128
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:31,581
before committing the crime,

129
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,381
but if he wanted to make it look like he fled from the window,

130
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:37,781
there's no mistake that the blood was smeared on beforehand.

131
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,481
But isn't it strange?

132
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:43,081
If the culprit's going to make it look like he fled from here,

133
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:47,781
it would look more real if he put an obvious bloody shoe print behind

134
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,581
than this smeared trace of blood.

135
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,181
True.

136
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,981
Maybe he thought if something more obvious was left behind,

137
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:56,981
it would be disclosed before the crime was committed?

138
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:01,081
Hey, hey! It's already 12:00 midnight?

139
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,781
I see. That room's right below the grand clock.

140
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,381
No, wrong!

141
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:14,781
The blood wasn't put there beforehand!

142
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:17,581
The Timekeeper really passed through here at the time of the crime.

143
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,181
Just as his planned!

144
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,281
As a result of checking you all,

145
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:29,481
there was no one with a hidden weapon on them

146
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:33,981
nor was there anyone with a large amount of blood on.

147
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:36,381
So, you may leave for today,

148
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,781
and tomorrow we will be performing a detailed interrogation.

149
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:43,381
And,

150
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,781
you have nothing to say about this, do you, Mr. Mouri?

151
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,381
No.

152
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:50,181
It seems that more than the mystery of the murder weapon disappearing,

153
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,481
it would be better to consider and figure out

154
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,681
the trick of how the culprit got away from the balcony

155
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,581
without leaving any footprints behind.

156
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,081
Dad?

157
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:05,181
I'm spinning around and around.

158
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,981
I spin around!

159
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,281
-Watch out! -Oh, no!

160
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,681
Just what do you think you're doing?

161
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:16,481
You'll fall!

162
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:18,781
Right.

163
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,881
I was almost about to fall

164
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,781
for the scheme that the culprit set up

165
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,981
while snickering inside this room!

166
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:31,381
So, the culprit is in this room after all?

167
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,681
Mr. Mouri.

168
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:34,781
It bothers me

169
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:38,481
that the culprit's footprints aren't found below the balcony,

170
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:42,981
but it's unthinkable that the culprit is in here.

171
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,481
All right then,

172
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:47,981
I shall show you by means of evidence now!

173
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:50,381
-Prove by evidence? -Yes.

174
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,781
It'll take some time to make preparations, though.

175
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:56,281
So, will you Inspector, and the guests go outside the room?

176
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:05,581
I wonder how long they expect to make us wait.

177
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,181
It seems that a young officer and the steward

178
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:10,581
are going in and out of the room from a while ago.

179
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,881
I wonder if he's really going to be able to prove it.

180
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,981
To kill a person without getting blood on himself

181
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,681
and get rid of the murder weapon at the same time?

182
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:21,781
How dare he locks me out of the room too?

183
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,581
He better have a darn good deduction or he's going to get it.

184
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,481
Thank you for waiting!

185
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:28,081
The room's ready.

186
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,881
Please enter the room, everyone!

187
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:34,281
Inspector!

188
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:37,581
Please hang this around your neck, Inspector.

189
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:42,981
Is this the wristwatch light that Conan always has on him?

190
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:44,281
Yes.

191
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:46,081
We're going to have you play the role

192
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,281
of the victim who was killed, Inspector.

193
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,681
That's to be used in place of the necklace

194
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,781
that had fluorescent paint on it.

195
00:10:57,381 --> 00:11:00,281
Nothing seems to be all that different.

196
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,381
True.

197
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:03,081
The only thing difference if anything is that

198
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,581
the boy with the glasses

199
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,581
is standing in front of the window that is closed.

200
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:13,481
I have no idea what you're planning to do,

201
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:15,281
but please hurry it up, will you?

202
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:17,881
Hey, what?

203
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:21,281
We're replaying the scene of the crime.

204
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,381
First, the lights of the room go out.

205
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,481
And the cake was brought in, correct?

206
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:26,981
Yes, sir.

207
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,481
Okay, Inspector, when I signal you,

208
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,081
please blow out the candles just as the victim did.

209
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,981
3, 2, 1.

210
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:38,381
Okay!

211
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:45,481
Who is it that just hit my head with a stick?

212
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,581
Hey, hey, what's with this experiment?

213
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:57,281
It's no use making believe to open the window and flee outside!

214
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:00,181
I saw the stick that hit me!

215
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,881
So, the one who's still holding the stick

216
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:05,681
-is surely the one who hit me! -I'm sorry.

217
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,481
I'm the one who hit you just now, Inspector.

218
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:11,981
Don't be ridiculous, Conan!

219
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,781
You don't even have a stick on you in the first place.

220
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,081
Of course I don't have one.

221
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,781
Because the stick I hit you with

222
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,981
flew out the window and disappeared.

223
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,081
What?

224
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,928
Is it true,

225
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,128
that the stick came flying?

226
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:37,228
Yes, sir!

227
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,828
But the thing that came flying wasn't a stick.

228
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,128
It was an umbrella that was pulled by a string.

229
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,128
An umbrella?

230
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,028
Hey, is it true?

231
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,728
Yes, sir! It's this umbrella!

232
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,128
Well, it took a while to get everything ready.

233
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:55,728
I had to have the steward get a long string ready

234
00:12:55,728 --> 00:12:57,428
and ask a clock technician

235
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:03,328
to advance the hands of the grand clock to 6:00 the time of the crime.

236
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,828
The clock?

237
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,428
Just what do you mean?

238
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,828
Here's the trick.

239
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,828
First, you get a long string

240
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:14,128
and tie a weight part way of it,

241
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:18,528
and hook on a ring that slides easily to one tip of the string.

242
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,828
Then you hook the ring onto the decoration

243
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:21,328
at the tip of the short hand of the grand clock

244
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:24,528
by pulling the string through.

245
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,028
As for the side with the weight on it,

246
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:30,128
you hang it over the railing of the balcony.

247
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,528
And the tip on the other side of the string

248
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:35,828
is pulled into the room from the space between the window.

249
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:38,128
The culprit waits for the room lights to go out and it gets dark

250
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,528
so the candles on the cake can be blown out.

251
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,728
After the string that is pulled into the room

252
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:44,128
is tied to the handle of the umbrella,

253
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:46,528
all is ready.

254
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,828
All that's left to do is for Conan to hit the Inspector on the head

255
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,328
a few seconds before it becomes 6:00.

256
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:53,728
A few seconds afterwards,

257
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,428
the short hand of the grand clock will face straight down,

258
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:57,428
and the ring with the string on it will come out

259
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:00,028
from the space of the decoration, and the ring will slide off.

260
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:02,428
The weight that was hanging falls

261
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:05,228
and the umbrella that is pulled pushes the window open

262
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:07,928
and falls below the balcony.

263
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:10,428
That's how it disappeared from the room.

264
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:12,228
Mr. Mouri,

265
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:15,728
there was no murder weapon or weight on the ground, you know.

266
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:18,128
Besides, if such a string were to be hanging,

267
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:21,128
wouldn't somebody has noticed it?

268
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:24,928
What if the string were to be a thin fishing line that is barely visible,

269
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,128
and the weight that was tied part way of the string

270
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:33,428
is inside the grid of the well that is right below the grand clock?

271
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:34,628
I see!

272
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:36,428
The murder weapon that was pulled by the weight

273
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:39,228
is sucked in as is into the well!

274
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,528
Yeah,

275
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:43,728
and since that well is scheduled to be gotten rid of week after next

276
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:47,628
that the culprit figured the murder weapon would be buried forever.

277
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:51,928
Why wasn't blood splattered on the culprit, then?

278
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:53,228
Come to think of it,

279
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:56,728
there were a lot of testimony about the image of the culprit, no?

280
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,628
The culprit is big, fat,

281
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,928
and moves swiftly, a woman wearing a dress.

282
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,128
The fact is,

283
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,728
all this was pointing to the murder weapon!

284
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,428
The murder weapon?

285
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,628
You thought the culprit moved swiftly

286
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:14,928
because the murder weapon with blood on it blew out of the window.

287
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:18,528
The umbrella was thought to be huge when it's opened,

288
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:22,028
it covers quite a large area.

289
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:23,928
And the testimony about the culprit being fat

290
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,128
was because when the murder weapon was pushed against the body,

291
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,628
it feels bouncy.

292
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,428
Since the murder weapon was covered with cloth,

293
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:35,128
the sound of the cloth of the dress rubbing against each other was heard.

294
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:38,128
What on earth is that murder weapon anyway?

295
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:44,728
This, the same one that I hit you with, Inspector!

296
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:45,728
Umbrella?

297
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:48,728
See, if you attach a sharp murder weapon

298
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:51,828
on the tip with a screw or something,

299
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:54,828
even if the culprit stabbed Mrs. Hoshina with this and pulled it out,

300
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,428
no blood would splatter, right?

301
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,228
Right, Pops?

302
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:02,728
But, the party was being held.

303
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,028
Bringing an umbrella in would be conspicuous, wouldn't it?

304
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:08,628
No, not if it was secretly hidden in his pocket or something.

305
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:10,928
Mr. Karube,

306
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,028
like the folding umbrella you have!

307
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:21,628
But Mr. Mouri,

308
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:25,628
although it's true that you can avoid blood being splattered...

309
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:30,028
After that, wouldn't it take time to fold the umbrella?

310
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,828
True.

311
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,328
When Mrs. Hoshina screamed,

312
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,328
it wasn't a long time before the bell of the grand clock

313
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,328
was heard, was it?

314
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:42,028
The umbrella can be folded in an instant.

315
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:45,228
If he didn't care about the blood that would get on his hands,

316
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,328
and narrowed the umbrella

317
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,728
and use the rubber band or whatever he had on his wrist to hold it down.

318
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,628
I see.

319
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:54,528
That's why Mr. Karube had quite a lot of blood on both his hands!

320
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:55,928
Yes.

321
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,528
If you, the one who was the last one

322
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,928
to close the door of the face of the clock,

323
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,128
you could've hooked the string onto the short hand of the clock.

324
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:06,528
After that, you said you were going to pray before the well,

325
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,728
so you could've pulled the string

326
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,328
that was hanging to the ground over to the well

327
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,428
and attach the weight, while pretending to pray.

328
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:16,028
Since you're the one who designed the building,

329
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:20,628
it would've been easy for you to tell how long the string should be.

330
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:25,328
You were touching Mrs. Hoshina's flashlight wristwatch before the crime,

331
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:27,128
so you could've moved the clock a few seconds fast

332
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,328
and after Mrs. Hoshina blew out the candle,

333
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,128
you could've used the few seconds before the grand clock rang

334
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:35,228
to commit the murder!

335
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,228
But Mr. Karube was the one

336
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,428
who said that he heard the sound of cloth being rubbed, right?

337
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,728
If he were the culprit, I wonder if he'd say anything

338
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,628
that would make people imagine an umbrella?

339
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,228
He deliberately said it.

340
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:50,728
He deliberately mixed some truth in his testimony to mislead us.

341
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:54,228
That is, that the culprit could be a woman who was wearing a dress.

342
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:55,428
If he lied about everything,

343
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:58,528
he would be the only one saying something different from all the others

344
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,128
and would be suspected.

345
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:02,228
But...

346
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:05,928
But when all the others didn't want to cooperate

347
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:08,328
and wanted to leave, Mr. Karube stopped them, didn't he?

348
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,128
He said let's cooperate with the police

349
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,028
for the sake of the late Mrs. Hoshina!

350
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:15,328
I think he would've gone home then, if he were the culprit.

351
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,828
True.

352
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,328
He couldn't leave even if he wanted to.

353
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:23,828
Because it suddenly began to rain again.

354
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:25,728
The umbrella that he brought when he came here

355
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:27,028
was used as the murder weapon,

356
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:28,928
and is in the well right now.

357
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:31,028
If he left at that time,

358
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:35,528
we would find out that the umbrella he was supposed to have is gone.

359
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,428
Too bad,

360
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:39,228
if you had assumed it may turn out this way

361
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:42,228
and prepared another umbrella...

362
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:46,228
No, I actually had another umbrella ready in my bag.

363
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:53,528
It seems that my wife took that extra umbrella out of my bag.

364
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:58,328
There was a memo written, "One umbrella will do, won't it?"

365
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:02,128
Well, it was the rain that I had been waiting for some time too,

366
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,228
so I failed to double check because I was so pressed

367
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,928
to carry out what I wanted to do.

368
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,628
That's where I went wrong too.

369
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:09,628
You were waiting for some time?

370
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:12,828
Does that mean that you've been planning this murder since two years ago

371
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:15,428
when the threat letter was first delivered here?

372
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:17,428
Yes. If it rains,

373
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:19,828
I could deceive everyone about the footprints of the culprit

374
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,328
not being there,

375
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,628
and none of the guests would go out on the balcony

376
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:24,928
where there is no roof either.

377
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:28,028
So, I didn't have to worry about my trick being disclosed.

378
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:32,328
Well, I was a little flustered when it stopped raining

379
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:33,928
before I committed the crime.

380
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:36,928
You're admitting that you committed the crime, then?

381
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,228
Yes.

382
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:41,328
Mrs. Hoshina's blood and my fingerprints

383
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:45,728
are probably all over the umbrella that I dropped into the well.

384
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:47,228
But, why?

385
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,028
Why did you kill her?

386
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:53,328
Doesn't my wanting to avenge

387
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:59,528
the death of my childhood friend clock technician suffice?

388
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:03,728
But, wasn't you who said at my big brother's funeral

389
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:06,228
that it was an unfortunate accident?

390
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:10,728
That is, until that funeral day,

391
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:15,028
when I heard her voice.

392
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,528
Hey, just what do you mean?

393
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:22,728
Why hasn't a clock technician to take his place been found yet?

394
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,928
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:27,528
Thinking of the clock technician who passed away,

396
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,928
I just couldn't get myself to look for someone else yet.

397
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,228
I've said time again, haven't I?

398
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,928
That a broke clock needs to be disposed of

399
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:34,528
and a new one needs to be bought to replace it!

400
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:37,228
The same goes for clock technicians!

401
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:39,528
Oh, my...

402
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,728
He loved clocks more than anyone else.

403
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:46,828
So, you're a clock technician here?

404
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,328
Yeah!

405
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,928
Are you going to do okay, though?

406
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:52,828
I hear the lady here is really strict when it comes to time.

407
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:54,928
Sure, I'll be just fine!

408
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:57,128
Being around someone strict like her makes my work even more worth it.

409
00:20:57,128 --> 00:21:00,828
Besides, not one clock had been disposed of since I came!

410
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:03,028
After all, my heart and soul

411
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,228
are in all the clocks here and are like family!

412
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:09,528
I'm really all for this job!

413
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:13,128
Brother...

414
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:23,428
Maybe rather than wanting to avenge his death,

415
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:26,928
what I really wanted to do was save them

416
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,128
from the ruler of time.

417
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:31,428
His so-called family.

418
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:54,528
Clocks...

419
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:57,428
They are indispensible partners for people

420
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,928
who need them to live every day.

421
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:02,328
Though they may sometimes be late.

422
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:05,328
Genta, you're late!

423
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:06,428
Sorry!

424
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,128
My alarm clock wasn't working right.

425
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:13,728
Don't tell me you're still using that old clock.

426
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:14,728
Yeah!

427
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,128
My late grandma gave it to me,

428
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:20,528
so if I dispose of it, I'll be cursed.

429
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:22,628
If that clock is precious,

430
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,528
I guess we'll overlook you being late.

431
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,128
After all, clocks keep ticking away and working

432
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:31,728
even while we're sleeping.

433
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:35,728
Geez, Conan sure is late.

434
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,828
We've got to get going soon,

435
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:41,428
or it'll be night by the time we get to the camping site.

436
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:43,528
Maybe he's still asleep.

437
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:49,828
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...

438
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,028
"Next Episode" -Ma'am!

439
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,528
Bring everybody one drink each, will you?

440
00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:54,928
My, my.

441
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:57,328
Aren't you generous, sir?

442
00:23:57,328 --> 00:24:00,628
I think Dad recently frequents this area to get his drink fix.

443
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:04,728
Amazing how they can drink with all this smoke.

444
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:10,828
Which means, one of the customers killed the woman owner.

445
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:15,828
Next Conan,

446
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:19,228
"The Scene of the Crime is a Super Cramped Shop".

447
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:23,055
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:25,155
"Glass".

449
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,855
Our next story has a Shouwa vibe?

450
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:27,855
There's no screentime for you!

451
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:29,755
This Great Detective will be on a roll!
