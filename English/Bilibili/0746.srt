1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
"Suzuki"

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,240
400 wins and no losses?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,140
At the World Karate Tournament?

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,640
That record sure is something to look forward to, isn't it?

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,940
No, not really.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,440
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to participate in the game the other day,

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,340
so, I lost by default.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,340
He skipped the game because of me, you see.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,540
-Well... -If it weren't for that,

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,640
the invincible myth would've continued!

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,640
But there is no need for outstanding physical power in the Suzuki Family.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,440
You!

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,540
Are you prepared to take on the responsibilities

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,940
of the Suzuki Financial Group?

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,240
Hey, Tomoko.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,440
It's too soon to talk of that.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,840
They're still in high school, you know.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,040
No.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,240
Now that it's been set that our oldest daughter Ayako,

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
has decided to marry the son of the Tomizawa's,

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,640
the only choice of a successor for us

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,840
is for Sonoko's husband-to-be to take after the name of our family!

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,940
If it were how it should be,

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,340
we would have to carefully consider his lineage and his academic history.

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,740
I had in mind that he had to be someone suitable for the Suzuki family,

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,940
and yet you're going with a hobo who,

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,440
despite being a mere high school student is studying abroad

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,540
to heighten his martial art powers?

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,740
Just what do you think you're doing, Sonoko?

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,240
It's all up to me, isn't it?

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,340
I have no intention of taking after this family anyway!

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,540
You listen!

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,040
Calm down.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Makoto, it's almost time for your return departure flight.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,240
I'll have the driver take you to the airport.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,640
Let's talk about this again at a later date.

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Yes.

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,140
And let me know when it's time for your next tournament.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,140
I may not look like it, but I love martial arts, you see.

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,340
Sure.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
"Ran"

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,940
It's from Ran.

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,740
Hey! I'm not finished yet.

44
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,640
Hello?

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,140
Huh? Thief Kid?

46
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,340
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Early this morning...

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,340
Right!

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,540
Kid's after Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki's jewel again

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,240
and he sent out a letter of warning about it.

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,540
It's being aired on the TV news just now.

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,840
No! Are you serious? No joke?

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,740
I'll call Uncle Jirokichi right now then!

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,640
Wait...

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,840
Geez. I wanted to tell her not to act excited

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,340
like she usually does because Mr. Kyogoku is here today.

56
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,240
Way to the contrary.

57
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,240
Hello, Uncle?

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
I heard about it, you know!

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,540
Thief Kid is coming again, isn't he?

60
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,840
Thief Kid?

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,840
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,340
A battle between two men that Sonoko adores?

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Jirokichi prepares a formidable ultimate weapon.

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
His name is Detective Conan!

68
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:50,086
"Thief Kid vs. Makoto Kyogoku (Part 1)".

69
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:54,886
Lost... lost all 100 confrontation simulations?

70
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:57,886
You mean he broke through

71
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,786
all of the newest security systems

72
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:02,586
that were completed just the other day?

73
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:04,286
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:07,486
Of course, it's only through the simulation on the computer though.

75
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,286
That is, the results attained by

76
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:11,686
inputting the mode of operation of Thief Kid up to now

77
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,586
and running a simulation of it.

78
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,286
He... he did so outstandingly.

79
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:19,486
What now?

80
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,886
The scheduled date's tomorrow, you know.

81
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:26,686
If things are left as is, it's all for his taking.

82
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:33,086
The Alexandrite that I travelled the world over to get a hold of.

83
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:37,686
The vivid green king of jewels, the Green Emperor.

84
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:42,586
But the ability of Kid being able to disguise himself as anybody

85
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:46,986
as well as his intellectual brilliance to cope with any situation,

86
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:49,886
on top of his super-human physical capacity,

87
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:52,286
if we were to add all that up as data...

88
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,086
No matter what kind of security system was to be used,

89
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,686
I think the end result would be the same.

90
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:56,786
If you'd like,

91
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:01,986
we could re-simulate everything by lowering Kid's ability by 20%.

92
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,586
He's only human too.

93
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,786
There could be days when he's not at his best.

94
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,486
You fool!

95
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:10,886
He's a great thief known for being keen and nimble!

96
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:13,786
Moreover, his abilities become more polished with each appearance.

97
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,686
Decreasing the rate by 20% won't help!

98
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:20,086
Well after all, it's a hundred to none.

99
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:23,886
I wonder about exhibiting the jewel knowing that he'll get a hold of it.

100
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:24,886
And although, I'm not all for it,

101
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,586
maybe I should just postpone exhibiting it this time.

102
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,786
Advisor Suzuki!

103
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,486
Right now at the entrance,

104
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:35,086
a weird man asking to see you.

105
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,286
What?

106
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:30,386
No use continuing any longer.

107
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:37,986
Will you please give Advisor Jirokichi Suzuki word

108
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,786
that I wish to see him?

109
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,986
What's going on?

110
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:45,386
Advisor!

111
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,786
I, here am called Makoto Kyogoku.

112
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:55,386
I'm a greenhorn that is now courting Sonoko.

113
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:57,986
You're Sonoko's boyfriend.

114
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:00,286
And, just what do you want with me?

115
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:02,786
I've heard that you're in possession of a jewel

116
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,686
that a thief, what's his name is seeking.

117
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,886
If so, I would like to offer you my services.

118
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:09,986
Won't you please assign me, Makoto Kyogoku

119
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:13,186
to guard this for you at the foot of the table, if you will?

120
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:15,286
I refuse!

121
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,386
I... I implore you...

122
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,886
You're such a novice.

123
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,286
I'll bet you just can't take the fact

124
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,486
Sonoko is head over heels over him, right?

125
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,086
But don't you worry!

126
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,786
It's just similar to a case of measles.

127
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:35,086
Measles?

128
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:39,586
I'll make sure that she forgets all about him

129
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,486
the moment I nab that guy.

130
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:43,686
Advisor!

131
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:46,986
Come on, go on home!

132
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,486
"Sonoko"

133
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:52,086
Sonoko? What a good timing.

134
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,986
Is Makoto there by chance?

135
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:57,586
Advisor, please hear me out one more time!

136
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,986
I'm at Haneda Airport now

137
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,186
and was taking care of Makoto's boarding procedure,

138
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,686
but he disappeared.

139
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:10,086
The driver says that he was asking for your address, you see.

140
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:13,086
So, I thought that he just may have gone over there.

141
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,986
What kind of guy is he?

142
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:19,386
I hear that he practices karate.

143
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,386
He's no ordinary karate practitioner, you know!

144
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,886
He has won 400 World Karate Championships with no losses,

145
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:27,186
an invincible prince of attacks!

146
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:32,986
Four... four-hundred championships, no losses?

147
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:39,586
Don't put any guards into the exhibition room of the jewel?

148
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:42,386
Why on earth?

149
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:45,786
Thief Kid's coming to steal, you know?

150
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,186
Advisor Suzuki called me a while ago

151
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:52,686
and said that they would get in the way of the newest security systems.

152
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:54,586
Don't tell me it's that old man again.

153
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,486
What's he up to anyway?

154
00:09:56,486 --> 00:10:01,786
And this is the footage that was sent after the phone call.

155
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,986
Footage?

156
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:11,586
One man is being surrounded by men armed with guns?

157
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:14,686
Of course they're just airsoft pellets,

158
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:17,086
but still, with this number of men at this range...

159
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:19,486
Moreover, the man in the middle

160
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:24,186
is wearing a gas mask that interferes with his visibility.

161
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:27,386
You'd think that it'd be impossible for him to avoid the pellets, huh?

162
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:37,186
Please fire at me all at once with the intent of defeating me.

163
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:01,686
His name is Makoto Kyogoku.

164
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:03,686
According to the Advisor,

165
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:08,186
he's the world's most formidable security system.

166
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:10,586
The... the world's most formidable?

167
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,186
You know her too, don't you?

168
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:17,886
The Advisor's niece, Sonoko.

169
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,186
He seems to be her boyfriend.

170
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,786
Boyfriend?

171
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,886
Very interesting.

172
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:39,786
Oh, my.

173
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:44,586
Don't tell me that you're planning to spend the night here in this museum.

174
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:49,786
Yes. Because I want to learn the size of this room by heart.

175
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:54,486
Well, I have my sleeping bag with me.

176
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:57,786
As well as a bit of food too.

177
00:11:57,786 --> 00:11:59,986
Hey, there.

178
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,686
Won't you like to make a bet with me?

179
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:05,786
Make a bet?

180
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:07,486
"Mouri Detective Agency"

181
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:11,686
Mr. Kyogoku and Thief Kid is going to confront each other?

182
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:15,286
-Really? -Right!

183
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:20,086
It seems Makoto went and personally negotiated things out Uncle Jirokichi!

184
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:25,786
I guess he got all fired up when he heard me talking about Sir Kid!

185
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,886
Don't you think it's just fantastic

186
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:31,586
that two good-looking men are going to confront each other

187
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:34,086
in a passionate battle over me?

188
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,286
Over you?

189
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:40,486
I don't think Kid gives a hoot about Sonoko, though.

190
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:44,286
And? Who do you wish would win?

191
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,186
Kid or Mr. Kyogoku?

192
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:51,286
Of course I'd like Makoto to win,

193
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:54,386
but neither do I want Sir Kid to lose.

194
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:58,386
Huh? What's with you? Make up your mind!

195
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:04,086
But Makoto... Well, you see, Kid is...

196
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:06,786
Hey, Sonoko? The phone's...

197
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,886
Hello, Ran? Ran?

198
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:12,986
"Out of range"

199
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:16,286
No joke! It's out of service range.

200
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:19,186
A transmitter function limiting device.

201
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:31,086
Good evening, my lady.

202
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,686
Thief... Thief Kid?

203
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,986
What brings you here?

204
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:46,386
Well, I just kind of got tired and stopped by to rest my wings.

205
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:50,186
While I'm at it...

206
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:53,486
May I ask you to make a bet with me?

207
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,386
Make a bet?

208
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,178
Thief Kid came last night?

209
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,778
To your room?

210
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,078
That's right!

211
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,478
He was standing by the window just like Peter Pan, you see!

212
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:20,278
He left right away

213
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,978
because one of our security guards found him, though.

214
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,278
Didn't you hear about it?

215
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:26,178
Of course not!

216
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:29,278
And? What did Kid come for?

217
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,078
Well, you see...

218
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:36,578
he asked me if I'd like to make a bet with him.

219
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:39,278
"As a reward for getting hold of the jewel I'm after,

220
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,278
I want your lips", he says.

221
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,578
That's a lie.

222
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,078
And, so what did he really say?

223
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,078
He actually said...

224
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,878
If he successfully gets hold of the Alexandrite Green Emperor

225
00:14:55,878 --> 00:15:01,578
that Uncle Jirokich is going to publicly exhibit,

226
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:06,878
he'd like to exchange it for a certain treasure that he specifies

227
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:10,178
out of all the treasures that the Suzuki Financial Group owns.

228
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,978
He wanted me to relay this to Uncle.

229
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,678
What is that certain treasure that he specified?

230
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:19,278
Beats me. He told me he'd tell me after he does his job.

231
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,678
And what was your answer?

232
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:24,578
Of course I told him off

233
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:27,478
saying that I would never go for anything

234
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,878
that a villain like him proposed!

235
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,278
Really?

236
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,378
Well, I did say it in a softer tone of voice, though.

237
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:38,578
Strange.

238
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:40,778
The only jewel that Thief Kid is after

239
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:45,078
should be the gigantic stone called the Big Jewel.

240
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,378
If the Suzuki Financial Group owns such a jewel,

241
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:53,478
I'm sure that the Advisor would've used it by now as bait to capture Kid.

242
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:58,278
Besides, why on earth would he tell Sonoko of something so important?

243
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:03,278
And? Where's Kyogoku who's supposed to protect that jewel?

244
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:05,478
As for Makoto...

245
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:07,678
He's with the jewel even now!

246
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,578
Even now?

247
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:13,478
Isn't that jewel already being publicly exhibited from today?

248
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:18,178
Yes, at the Grand Suzuki Museum where we're going to from now!

249
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,578
Don't tell me

250
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,778
that he's standing beside the exhibition case wearing a dreadful look?

251
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,678
Well, you'll see once we get there!

252
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:44,578
Huh, why does he look so bored with the jewel hanging from his neck?

253
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,178
Weird, isn't it?

254
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:47,678
Never mind.

255
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:51,378
-See? -True.

256
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,078
What's the difference?

257
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,678
Good job, Sonoko!

258
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:58,978
To choose such an invincible one as your boyfriend,

259
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,078
you're my niece all right!

260
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,078
Uncle Jirokichi!

261
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:04,978
But, the time that Kid's scheduled to appear

262
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:07,478
is at 10 p.m. after all the guests have left.

263
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:09,978
So it's too early for him to...

264
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:13,078
He sincerely wished to do so!

265
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,278
After making it look as if it had been stolen at the scheduled time,

266
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:19,578
he wanted to avoid having to find out that

267
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,278
the jewel was actually exchanged for a fake.

268
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,578
He may be a master of Karate,

269
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,778
but he's still in high school, isn't he?

270
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,878
I wonder if it's appropriate to make him guard the jewel alone.

271
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:32,578
Haven't you seen it?

272
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:35,178
The awesome footage that I sent to MPD of him

273
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:43,578
knocking over the 11 men as quick as lightning?

274
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:49,378
But if Kid uses his forte which is to cause a black-out again...

275
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:52,278
No need for worry.

276
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:57,278
He is an invincible prince of attacks who sees with his mind's eye.

277
00:17:57,278 --> 00:18:01,278
If in the dark, Kid's the one who'll be in a fix!

278
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:04,678
Besides,

279
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:07,278
I've got a secret plan too.

280
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:09,578
Secret plan?

281
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:11,178
Kid's forte is to become an imposter

282
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,878
and act as if he's someone very close to us.

283
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:17,678
That is, he disguises himself well to get close to the jewel.

284
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:21,078
Yes, just like when he disguised himself as my husband some time ago.

285
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:24,278
I just happened to fall for his fake phone call back then.

286
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,478
Both you Advisor, and Inspector Nakamori

287
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:30,278
have similar experiences, don't you?

288
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:33,378
Yeah, that's why we're doing all this.

289
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,778
We even pinch faces at times.

290
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:38,578
I guess it's all right for you men to do so, but...

291
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:39,978
Ouch.

292
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:43,978
It's not easy to do something so rude like this to women.

293
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:48,578
So, this is what I prepared.

294
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:53,278
A specially ordered outfit from a designer in Paris that I just received.

295
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,978
This one of a kind outfit that cannot be found elsewhere in the world.

296
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:59,078
This is the outfit!

297
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:05,078
But, that outfit,

298
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,878
if Kid puts you to sleep and removes it from you...

299
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:10,478
That applies only to you men.

300
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:12,178
As far as I know,

301
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:17,678
Kid has never taken anything off a woman and disguised himself as her.

302
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,178
In other words, as long as I have this outfit on,

303
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:23,578
it's apparent that I'm the real me!

304
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,878
I see.

305
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,278
So, Masumi isn't included, is she?

306
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:33,578
Of course, I've got clothes for Sonoko and her friend too.

307
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:34,778
Me too?

308
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:38,078
I just stopped over here on my way back from school, and yet.

309
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:41,078
Please change later, will you?

310
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,578
That is, only after we pinch each other's faces.

311
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:45,978
Yes.

312
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,278
And...

313
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:52,078
I'm sure that the Advisor wouldn't want this Kid Killer boy

314
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:54,478
to leave either anyway.

315
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:59,678
Oh, that's right!

316
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,778
When I looked into the mailbox this morning,

317
00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:04,378
I got this letter from Sir Kid.

318
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:07,178
What?

319
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:08,978
"Makoto Kyogoku"

320
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:10,678
It was addressed to Makoto, though.

321
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:20,278
What on earth does he want?

322
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,278
Blank?

323
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:30,178
Don't tell me he's going to forget about everything this time?

324
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:34,478
Could he have been too afraid to confront the master of Karate?

325
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,478
I don't think it's blank.

326
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,378
Maybe it's invisible ink revealed by applying heat?

327
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:43,778
It smells like fruit too.

328
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,678
Invisible ink?

329
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,778
Let's use my lighter to apply heat to it.

330
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,378
Some words are...

331
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:02,778
"Okay, let's have it out fair and square. Thief Kid".

332
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,878
Huh? Is that all?

333
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:07,178
Yes. There's nothing written behind either.

334
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:10,678
That's probably

335
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,478
a symbolic message from him daring you to smoke him out

336
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:15,178
and catch him if you can.

337
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:18,378
A very wretched way of challenging someone, I guess.

338
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,278
Come, Sonoko, Ran!

339
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,378
Let's go get changed.

340
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,378
Okay.

341
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:27,378
Before that...

342
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:42,378
After you grow up.

343
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:45,478
Hang in there, Makoto!

344
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:46,878
Sure thing.

345
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:49,778
I...

346
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,578
believe in you.

347
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,178
Yes! I will protect it over my dead body

348
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,278
with these fists of mine!

349
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:02,478
Come along now, Sonoko.

350
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,878
I also have faith in you

351
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:25,378
and believe that you will keep your word.

352
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:26,678
Yes, I will.

353
00:22:28,578 --> 00:22:30,378
Of course.

354
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:53,478
"Next Episode" -Kid! Kid! Kid!

355
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,878
What's this?

356
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:00,578
Kid, Kid, Kid!

357
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:04,078
Okay, I'm ready when you are!

358
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:08,178
I'll make you pay for all you've done so far!

359
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:10,078
May I please have a look at the letters?

360
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:12,578
I won't take them out of the bag!

361
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:13,678
Hey!

362
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,578
Next Conan,

363
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:20,778
"Thief Kid vs. Makoto Kyogoku (Part 2)".

364
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,678
Next Conan's Hint:

365
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,778
"Candle".

366
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:43,578
Sonoko, who's side are you on anyway?

367
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:45,578
The ultimate choice...
