1
00:00:01.607 --> 00:00:03.007
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:04.907
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:06.607
Finally solved is the mystery of the mansion.

4
00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.107
Officer Yamamura is not his usual self.

5
00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.907
Everyone is surprised and amazed!

6
00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:11.207
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:12.907
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:14.707
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:58.967
On the way to Sonoko's villa,

10
00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:01.567
we run into an accident.

11
00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.267
So we decided to borrow the phone at a villa nearby.

12
00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.267
The villa happens to be a place

13
00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:09.267
where members of a popular rock band "Dorcus" bought.

14
00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:10.467
It was a mansion with a story behind it.

15
00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:11.967
A devil is said to live in it.

16
00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.367
And...

17
00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.967
one of the members,

18
00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.867
Rinko Honami dies.

19
00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.467
But I began to doubt it was a suicide.

20
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.767
So this is nothing other than suicide.

21
00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:33.867
Its what you think I might say, but the fact is otherwise.

22
00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:38.567
This is a locked-room murder that was cleverly set up by someone!

23
00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.367
And the murderer is among you.

24
00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:49.367
"Sealed Western-style Window (Part 2)"

25
00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:50.867
Wait a minute.

26
00:02:50.867 --> 00:02:54.367
Do you mean there is a murderer among us?

27
00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.167
It's a joke, isn't it?

28
00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:58.167
I want you to explain

29
00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:02.067
how this became a locked-room case.

30
00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:04.167
I was just stating an example.

31
00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:09.667
Well, let us hear it, shall we?

32
00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.867
When and where did you see Rinko for the last time?

33
00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:14.667
Before her body was discovered,

34
00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:19.367
-Ran, please put me down. -where and what were you all doing?

35
00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.267
The last time I saw her

36
00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:25.667
was when she stormed into the next room shouting at us about the noise.

37
00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:30.667
Afterwards, I went upstairs to my room to practice with my guitar.

38
00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.267
"Yoji Kuramoto (28)" -Until Toru began shouting

39
00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:35.267
that something was wrong with Rinko in front of this room.

40
00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:37.067
When Rinko yelled and came into the room,

41
00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:38.567
you both were there, weren't you?

42
00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:39.967
Yeah.

43
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:41.367
"Toru Tendou (30)" -After that,

44
00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:44.867
I was listening to CDs in my room right above this room.

45
00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:49.567
And I remembered that I haven't give the CD Rinko asked me to buy,

46
00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.567
so I went down to Rinko's room.

47
00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:55.467
"Jun Makino (29)" -I was arranging books in the room

48
00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.767
where Rinko shouted at us earlier.

49
00:03:57.767 --> 00:03:59.467
Since the previous owner had said

50
00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:01.267
in return for selling the house for a cheap price,

51
00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:05.267
he wanted us to get rid whatever was left in the villa on our own.

52
00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:07.867
I was sorting out and choosing books that I thought could be sold.

53
00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:10.367
I had no trouble choosing the books,

54
00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.367
because all the book in this house were in order.

55
00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:16.367
But...

56
00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:20.067
I wonder why the owner leave everything behind?

57
00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:23.567
He probably didn't want to come back here again.

58
00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:27.567
The owner's brother and his brother's wife commit suicide here.

59
00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.967
He even left the window that the demon is said to come through as it was.

60
00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:33.667
Did you say a devil?

61
00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.467
Do you want to see it?

62
00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:38.567
It is in the next room which I was in before.

63
00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:50.167
It's true.

64
00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.967
It sure looks like a devil came through it.

65
00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:55.467
I heard that's why it was closed off.

66
00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:59.367
The elder brother of the wealthy brothers who built this villa did this.

67
00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:02.367
How can you sleep in a room like this?

68
00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:04.167
This is your room, isn't it?

69
00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:05.167
No, sir.

70
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:09.667
My room is on the first floor which was used by the younger brother's wife.

71
00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:12.267
This is the maid's room,

72
00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:14.767
which is why it doesn't look as furnished.

73
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:16.367
But don't you think it's unnatural?

74
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:17.567
The maid's room were on the second floor

75
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.667
and the owner's wife on the first floor.

76
00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:21.967
It seems she had a physical disability,

77
00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:24.467
so she stayed on the first floor with no stairs.

78
00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:27.867
Well, I'm sleeping in the elder brother's room

79
00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:30.067
who is said to have committed suicide without problem.

80
00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.067
This sure was the elder brother's room.

81
00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:35.467
There are a lot of fine furniture here.

82
00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:42.467
There are four windows facing the backyard.

83
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.167
It is the same size as Rinko's room.

84
00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:48.967
This is a really gorgeous room.

85
00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:51.767
This belonged to the younger of the rich brothers.

86
00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:54.067
Well, I guess you could say that

87
00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:56.567
the elder brother's wife committed suicide because of the younger brother.

88
00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:02.067
When we bought this house, we were told a story.

89
00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:03.867
The reason the older brother's wife committed suicide

90
00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:05.467
was because the older brother found out

91
00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:07.667
that she was having an affair with his younger brother and he accused her.

92
00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:10.267
Maybe the older brother regretted driving her to death

93
00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:13.067
and killed himself.

94
00:06:13.067 --> 00:06:14.467
An affair?

95
00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:15.667
Yes.

96
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.467
The younger brother and his older brother's wife

97
00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:20.567
seems to have been secretly contacting each other since they came here

98
00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:22.267
and saw each other at nights.

99
00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:28.367
Anyway, let me consult with a senior officer about the case.

100
00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:29.667
You all wait here for now.

101
00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:48.267
Just as I thought.

102
00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:49.567
The tree branches are in the way,

103
00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:51.767
so only the window on the second floor is in view.

104
00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.367
Which means that behind the lid of the bird nest...

105
00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:57.767
I thought so.

106
00:06:57.767 --> 00:06:59.767
There's a slot to slide the plate in.

107
00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.467
There's no doubt about it.

108
00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:05.267
The one who killed Rinko and made it look like a suicide

109
00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:06.967
is that person.

110
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.067
All by utilizing the story

111
00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:10.867
of this villa's demon.

112
00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:23.167
Well, after asking the senior officer,

113
00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:27.967
an incident seems to have happened here at the villa two years ago.

114
00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:29.967
The people who died back then

115
00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:33.967
were the older of the two brothers and his wife.

116
00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:35.567
First, the older brother's wife committed suicide

117
00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:39.367
using a rope in her room on the second floor.

118
00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:41.567
Three days later, the older brother killed himself

119
00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:45.167
by jumping from his room on the third floor.

120
00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.967
The room in which the older brother's wife killed herself using a rope

121
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:53.567
seems to have been the same room where Rinko Honami was found dead.

122
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:57.267
The incident occurred after the older brother nailed down the window,

123
00:07:57.267 --> 00:08:00.967
saying, "A devil has come to live here."

124
00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:04.767
He then renovated the walls and floors of the house.

125
00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:09.567
The locals became frightened and call it the villa where the devil resides.

126
00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:16.267
So we'll be going to the police station.

127
00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.367
What? You're leaving?

128
00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:20.567
Shouldn't you investigate more in detail?

129
00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:24.067
Like, who the ominous silhouetted figure

130
00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:27.767
that was looking out from the supposedly sealed window.

131
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:30.167
What? You saw that?

132
00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:31.367
Well, yes.

133
00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:33.967
From the backyard where the window is in view.

134
00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:35.767
If so, the more I'll be on my way.

135
00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:37.567
-What? -What? Why?

136
00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:40.267
Because it's a devil! A devil!

137
00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:42.567
The police could never catch something like that!

138
00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.467
Hey.

139
00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:50.567
Besides, the room where Rinko hung herself was completely sealed.

140
00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:53.567
The door key was found in the center of the room, too.

141
00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.267
Rinko was possessed by the devil, that's why she committed suicide.

142
00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:57.967
That's the only thing thinkable, right?

143
00:08:57.967 --> 00:09:01.967
Then, was the prank played in that room also the work of the devil?

144
00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:03.767
Prank?

145
00:09:03.767 --> 00:09:07.767
Because 3 came after 6, and 1 came after 4!

146
00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:10.767
But the others were all in sequential order!

147
00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:14.367
Just what are you talking about?

148
00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:16.467
Ignore him!

149
00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:18.367
He's just a brat.

150
00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:21.967
By the way, may we get on with what we need to do?

151
00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:24.767
Since such a terrible thing happened to one of our band members.

152
00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:28.167
We want to discuss how we'll go about things from now on.

153
00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.967
Yes, you may,

154
00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:34.467
but I advise you all to get out of here as soon as possible.

155
00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:36.267
When Rinko committed suicide,

156
00:09:36.267 --> 00:09:40.767
Ms. Jun Makino was in the room next door, which is the maid's room.

157
00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:43.767
The window that has been sealed with nails is also there.

158
00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:45.667
At that time, Mr. Yoji Kuramoto was in the room

159
00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:48.667
on the third floor right above Ms. Jun Makino,

160
00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:53.067
the same room in which the older brother jumped from and killed himself.

161
00:09:53.067 --> 00:09:54.367
And at about the same time,

162
00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:58.067
there is no queer story behind Toru Tendou's room,

163
00:09:58.067 --> 00:10:01.667
but it is next to Yoji's room

164
00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.667
and right above Rinko's room.

165
00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:06.967
Which makes it the path that Rinko's dead spirit would walk through.

166
00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:08.467
Maybe...

167
00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:13.867
something may have possessed you three, too!

168
00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:14.867
Yeah.

169
00:10:14.867 --> 00:10:16.867
That's why we decided to stay here tonight

170
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:19.267
and head home first thing in the morning.

171
00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:21.967
I've got to organize Rinko's things, too.

172
00:10:21.967 --> 00:10:25.267
We brought a lot of things here with us.

173
00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:29.967
It must be big sis!

174
00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:32.067
Since she has come for us, shall we go home?

175
00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:33.367
I guess so.

176
00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:34.667
Hey, officer.

177
00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:38.067
The fact is, just a while ago...

178
00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:43.967
What is it? Is something wrong?

179
00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:46.667
No, it's nothing.

180
00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.067
That's right.

181
00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:50.967
I'd like to have all your contact numbers,

182
00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:53.567
so could you all wait in your rooms?

183
00:10:53.567 --> 00:10:55.567
It'll only take a few minutes.

184
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:57.067
Yeah.

185
00:10:57.067 --> 00:10:58.467
Sure.

186
00:10:58.467 --> 00:10:59.867
That's no problem.

187
00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:08.567
They're finally gone.

188
00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:11.467
Shall we go get our stuff together then?

189
00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:13.567
-Yeah. -I guess so.

190
00:11:13.567 --> 00:11:17.267
I'll go clean up my room as well as Rinko's.

191
00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:19.867
Are you sure you can handle it alone?

192
00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:22.367
I'll help you with Rinko's room if you like.

193
00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:23.867
Forget it.

194
00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:26.067
Leave it up to Jun.

195
00:11:26.067 --> 00:11:30.067
I'm sure Rinko has stuff that she doesn't want others to see.

196
00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:31.567
That's right.

197
00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:34.367
Okay, so let's hurry and clean up,

198
00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:36.067
so we can head home first thing tomorrow morning.

199
00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:37.367
Yeah.

200
00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:11.976
So you've finally given yourself away.

201
00:13:11.976 --> 00:13:13.676
Mr. Yoji Kuramoto!

202
00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:15.676
Rather, I would like...

203
00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:19.676
to address you as the man who killed Rinko!

204
00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:24.376
Yoji, it was you after all.

205
00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:25.876
You killed Rinko.

206
00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:28.276
Hey, just what are you talking about?

207
00:13:28.276 --> 00:13:30.276
Why would I do something like that?

208
00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:33.576
How come you guys are in my room?

209
00:13:33.576 --> 00:13:35.376
I'm sure I locked the door.

210
00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:38.076
I opened it from inside.

211
00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:40.376
What?

212
00:13:40.376 --> 00:13:41.876
The officer told me to do so.

213
00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:45.276
I pretended that I already went home,

214
00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:47.576
but I was hiding in this room all this time.

215
00:13:48.976 --> 00:13:51.076
I snuck into this room like you just did,

216
00:13:51.076 --> 00:13:56.176
passing through the secret corridor from Rinko's room.

217
00:13:56.176 --> 00:13:57.576
Secret corridor?

218
00:13:57.576 --> 00:13:59.176
No use playing dumb!

219
00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:02.176
We were watching from Rinko's room just now!

220
00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:06.376
We watched you open the door behind the bookshelf

221
00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:09.576
and rearranged the books before putting them back, right?

222
00:14:11.276 --> 00:14:15.776
And we also watched you came out of that closet

223
00:14:15.776 --> 00:14:17.776
from the peephole on that door.

224
00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:22.476
In other words, I also know how you did it.

225
00:14:22.476 --> 00:14:24.776
You told Rinko that you had something to talk to her about

226
00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:27.376
and made her let you into her room.

227
00:14:27.376 --> 00:14:30.576
Then you caught her off guard and strangled her to death.

228
00:14:30.576 --> 00:14:31.976
You suspended her in mid air using a rope,

229
00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:35.376
then locked the door and the windows to create a locked room.

230
00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:38.576
You used the secret corridor that was used just now

231
00:14:38.576 --> 00:14:41.376
and snuck back to your room

232
00:14:41.376 --> 00:14:46.876
and made it look as if Rinko had committed suicide.

233
00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:49.676
But your plan wasn't perfect.

234
00:14:49.676 --> 00:14:51.476
When you put the books back on the bookshelf,

235
00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:53.376
which is the entrance to the secret corridor,

236
00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:55.876
you made a mistake in lining the books up in sequential order.

237
00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:59.876
You heard Conan mention the order of the books.

238
00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:04.176
You were afraid the police would find the secret passage,

239
00:15:04.176 --> 00:15:08.176
so you decided to fix it while everyone was asleep.

240
00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:12.576
Well, it's not surprising that you'd make a mistake.

241
00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:16.576
Because you can't see the order from outside.

242
00:15:16.576 --> 00:15:18.776
But it's amazing that you found out

243
00:15:18.776 --> 00:15:20.676
about the secret corridor.

244
00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:23.576
I found it easily.

245
00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:24.776
Because...

246
00:15:24.776 --> 00:15:25.976
Because?

247
00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:27.776
Because, well...

248
00:15:28.776 --> 00:15:30.376
Huh?

249
00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:31.576
Let's see...

250
00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:33.176
What was it?

251
00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:38.676
I see. I get it, that's right.

252
00:15:40.876 --> 00:15:43.176
When I saw the windows at this villa,

253
00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:46.276
something suddenly hits me.

254
00:15:46.276 --> 00:15:48.576
Unlike Rinko's room on the second floor,

255
00:15:48.576 --> 00:15:50.576
or Yoji's room on the third floor

256
00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:54.076
and Toru's room,

257
00:15:54.076 --> 00:15:56.376
I noticed that only the maid's room with the sealed window

258
00:15:56.376 --> 00:15:59.476
has narrow spaces between the windows.

259
00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:03.676
And the distance between the side wall was short.

260
00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:05.876
And when I heard Conan's casual remark

261
00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:09.776
about the queer change in the bookshelf of Rinko's room,

262
00:16:09.776 --> 00:16:11.776
I was convinced.

263
00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:15.976
The window couldn't be opened not because it was nailed shut,

264
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.676
but because only half of it was nailed.

265
00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:22.276
The left side of the window is inside of the secret passage,

266
00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.776
which is why it can't be opened.

267
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.376
And a narrow corridor in the space made from this contraption

268
00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:28.676
lead to the bookshelf in Rinko's room,

269
00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:31.376
which was the doorway to this corridor.

270
00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:35.276
To make the nailed window stand out less,

271
00:16:35.276 --> 00:16:39.076
a bookshelf was put between the next two windows.

272
00:16:39.076 --> 00:16:44.376
This way, no one would notice the amount of space between them.

273
00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:47.176
If a wall partition is positioned on one side of the window,

274
00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:50.376
a window that will open only half way could be made in the secret passage.

275
00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.476
I see!

276
00:16:51.476 --> 00:16:55.276
That's why when I saw someone looking out the window,

277
00:16:55.276 --> 00:16:58.776
only the lower window on the left side was opened.

278
00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:02.776
But who built the secret passage and for what reason?

279
00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:09.276
The one who made it was the owner of this house, the older brother.

280
00:17:09.276 --> 00:17:10.576
The four rooms in question

281
00:17:10.576 --> 00:17:14.076
have four windows each of the same size, facing the backyard.

282
00:17:14.076 --> 00:17:16.976
If the room right below has a narrow window because of the secret passage,

283
00:17:16.976 --> 00:17:22.376
it is because the entrance to the passage is directly above it.

284
00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.176
The brother pretended he saw a devil,

285
00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.676
so he could build this secret passage

286
00:17:26.676 --> 00:17:29.676
and renovated the floor and walls of the villa.

287
00:17:29.676 --> 00:17:33.476
Even if the room became a bit smaller, it was the maid's room,

288
00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:37.276
so no one would complain about the room becoming smaller anyway.

289
00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:39.776
Then why did he make it?

290
00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:42.776
To watch and confirm

291
00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:46.576
whether his wife and younger brother were having an affair.

292
00:17:46.576 --> 00:17:49.976
According to Conan, there's a bird house in the backyard.

293
00:17:49.976 --> 00:17:53.476
On the back of the bird house entrance, there's a slot to slide a plate in.

294
00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.176
When the younger brother slide a plate in...

295
00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:59.076
it was a sign telling his sister-in-law

296
00:17:59.076 --> 00:18:01.876
to unlock the door of the room and wait for him.

297
00:18:01.876 --> 00:18:04.376
But if his older brother looks into the bird house,

298
00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.076
he would find out right away, wouldn't he?

299
00:18:06.076 --> 00:18:08.576
If his younger brother and his wife sees that,

300
00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:12.776
they would come up with another idea to signal each other, wouldn't they?

301
00:18:12.776 --> 00:18:15.476
Moreover, that bird house could only be seen from the second floor

302
00:18:15.476 --> 00:18:17.276
because the branches of the tree were in the way.

303
00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:20.576
He couldn't look in from his wife's or the maid's room.

304
00:18:20.576 --> 00:18:23.776
That's why the older brother made that secret passage.

305
00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:27.576
He could confirm the signal when they wanted to see each other secretly,

306
00:18:27.576 --> 00:18:31.176
as well as watch them having an affair from the passage.

307
00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:35.676
Well, there's no way of knowing at this point already.

308
00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:40.176
Let's say the older brother killed his wife and made it look like suicide.

309
00:18:40.176 --> 00:18:41.976
Then unable to bear the feeling of guilt over what he had done,

310
00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:45.276
he most likely committed suicide after killing his wife.

311
00:18:45.276 --> 00:18:48.976
And Yoji who happened to find the secret passage

312
00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:52.476
killed Rinko the same way the older brother killed his wife,

313
00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:53.876
I see.

314
00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:57.976
You didn't let me clean Rinko's room,

315
00:18:57.976 --> 00:18:59.676
so that I would use the secret passage in the middle of the night

316
00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:03.776
to put the books that were out of sequence back in sequence again.

317
00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:06.776
So both of you were working along with the police?

318
00:19:06.776 --> 00:19:07.876
Yes.

319
00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:11.876
The officer told us when he came to get our contact number.

320
00:19:11.876 --> 00:19:15.176
He told us not to let you near Rinko's room.

321
00:19:17.376 --> 00:19:21.376
And aren't you going to ask me why I killed her?

322
00:19:21.376 --> 00:19:24.176
No. It's about the guitar, isn't it?

323
00:19:24.176 --> 00:19:27.376
But didn't you settle it saying that you would go along with her?

324
00:19:27.376 --> 00:19:28.876
Yeah.

325
00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.176
I tried the best I could

326
00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:34.876
and went over to Rinko's room to show her how much I tried.

327
00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:37.176
But that woman...

328
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.376
No good at all. You're way off.

329
00:19:40.376 --> 00:19:43.076
Haven't you been listening to the latest music?

330
00:19:43.076 --> 00:19:45.576
Your guitar playing is out of date!

331
00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:48.776
I'd advise you to start learning everything from scratch again.

332
00:19:48.776 --> 00:19:54.076
Then she started degrading my favorite guitarist.

333
00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:56.776
And when I realized that I couldn't hear her anymore...

334
00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.276
Right in front of my eyes...

335
00:20:01.276 --> 00:20:03.076
Right in front of my eyes, Rinko was...

336
00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:05.776
Rinko was lying on the floor.

337
00:20:05.776 --> 00:20:08.176
Then you weren't planning on killing her to begin with?

338
00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:12.276
Wrong. I think I had the intention to kill her.

339
00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:16.376
I didn't tell anybody that I found the secret passage

340
00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:17.876
and was waiting for the chance to kill her one day.

341
00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:20.376
I had the rope hidden at that time, too.

342
00:20:21.476 --> 00:20:25.676
It's not like I was thinking of killing her at that time.

343
00:20:25.676 --> 00:20:29.176
That's why I panicked and hung her from the chandelier near the door

344
00:20:29.176 --> 00:20:31.876
and rushed to remove the key to that room from the key holder

345
00:20:31.876 --> 00:20:34.276
and left through the secret passage.

346
00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.676
To make sure no one saw me, I looked outside.

347
00:20:40.076 --> 00:20:43.676
I ended up being seen by that boy wearing glasses.

348
00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:45.876
Well...

349
00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:51.076
Maybe it's me who was possessed by devil in this villa.

350
00:20:51.076 --> 00:20:52.776
The rope that I used

351
00:20:52.776 --> 00:20:54.976
was something I found on the floor of the secret passage.

352
00:20:56.676 --> 00:20:58.176
It was probably the rope that was left

353
00:20:58.176 --> 00:21:01.576
after the wealthy older brother killed his wife.

354
00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:34.276
Please take him to the station.

355
00:22:34.276 --> 00:22:35.276
Yes, sir!

356
00:22:40.576 --> 00:22:44.276
What a fantastic deduction it was, officer.

357
00:22:44.276 --> 00:22:46.976
I didn't know you had such hidden talent, Officer Yamamura.

358
00:22:46.976 --> 00:22:51.376
Well, I wouldn't mind considering you my rival.

359
00:22:51.376 --> 00:22:52.476
No, well...

360
00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.676
The deduction I made were all thanks to Mr. Mouri...

361
00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:57.976
P.S, P.S.

362
00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:00.376
P.S.?

363
00:23:04.276 --> 00:23:05.476
P.S.:

364
00:23:05.476 --> 00:23:06.476
"I'd be embarrassed if people found out

365
00:23:06.476 --> 00:23:09.476
that I was involved in such a rinky-dink case.

366
00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:12.176
So don't tell anyone that you were getting help from me."

367
00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:14.776
Kogoro Mouri.

368
00:23:17.276 --> 00:23:20.276
Well, with a brain like mine,

369
00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:22.276
a case like this is as sweet and easy to handle

370
00:23:22.276 --> 00:23:24.476
as honey in sweet azuki beans dessert!

371
00:23:28.076 --> 00:23:29.876
Shall we head on home then?

372
00:23:29.876 --> 00:23:30.976
Let's go.

373
00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:33.576
But to see through the case at the villa

374
00:23:33.576 --> 00:23:36.176
just by hearing about it from you on the phone,

375
00:23:36.176 --> 00:23:38.676
Detective Mouri is really something after all.

376
00:23:38.676 --> 00:23:39.676
Yeah.

377
00:23:40.676 --> 00:23:43.576
If he had to move in to the range of the service area of the cell phone

378
00:23:43.576 --> 00:23:46.376
and e-mail me something like this,

379
00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:47.676
he may as well have come here directly

380
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:50.676
and put on the Sleeping Kogoro show.

381
00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:51.776
Yeah.

382
00:23:51.776 --> 00:23:55.576
Actually I wanted to put either Sonoko or you to sleep.

383
00:23:55.576 --> 00:23:56.976
But I couldn't.

384
00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:01.476
Not in front of him.

385
00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:06.876
"Next Episode" -It's Paipo, Paipo's Shuringan.

386
00:24:06.876 --> 00:24:08.876
Shuringan's Gurindai.

387
00:24:08.876 --> 00:24:11.876
Gurindai's Popokopi and Ponpokona.

388
00:24:11.876 --> 00:24:14.976
Now, the name is Chokyumei Chosuke.

389
00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:21.676
Who was the master waiting for, anyway?

390
00:24:23.576 --> 00:24:24.976
These two think that the other is the culprit

391
00:24:24.976 --> 00:24:26.576
and they're protecting each other.

392
00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:33.676
Next Conan, "Meguro Saury"

393
00:24:49.476 --> 00:24:51.576
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:51.576 --> 00:24:54.176
"Fairy tale"

395
00:24:54.176 --> 00:24:58.176
Too bad for Deduction Queen Sonoko...
