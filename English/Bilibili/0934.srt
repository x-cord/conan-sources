1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.070
The old man was hired by three suspicious people

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.470
to protect the racing horse, White Spirits,

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.370
who had received several death threats.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.670
"White Spirits, Racing Horse" -Several days later,

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.670
"Kozo Tokuyoshi (55), Horse Owner" -White Spirits was to be transported

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.570
to a track outside of Tokyo for a race.

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.070
"White Spirits" -The old man escorted the horse trailer, but...

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.570
At some point, White Spirits was swapped out for an impostor.

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.670
Horse owner, Tokuyoshi received a ransom note

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.970
demanding 100 million yen.

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.770
Unable to trust the police or detectives,

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.070
Tokuyoshi followed the kidnapper's instructions alone

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.970
and had the ransom money stolen from him.

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.070
In my eyes are maximum creation.

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.870
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.570
The ransom money and horse go missing.

17
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.670
The two cases are connected in a surprising way.

18
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.370
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.470
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:57.911
"The Thoroughbred Kidnapping Case (Part 2)"

22
00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:13.111
"White Spirits"

23
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:19.111
I'm certain of it, inspector.

24
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:22.711
This is the horse blanket White Spirits was wearing.

25
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:26.711
Oh, no.

26
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.011
Is he already...

27
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:31.211
Inspector, according to a local

28
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.111
who took their garbage out an hour ago,

29
00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.211
that wasn't here at that time.

30
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.911
How did the police know this was here?

31
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:44.711
We received an anonymous tip.

32
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.311
An anonymous tip?

33
00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:48.311
They thought it was dumped illegally.

34
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.311
And there seems to be blood on it,

35
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:52.111
so they wanted us to investigate.

36
00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:00.111
I received a report from forensics.

37
00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:05.111
The blood on the horse blanket matched White Spirits'.

38
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.311
Are you sure?

39
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.811
We got the data from the stable's vet.

40
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:11.411
It's definitely his.

41
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:16.411
Which means it's possible he's already...

42
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:20.011
The media's starting to make a fuss, too.

43
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:22.311
That can't be helped.

44
00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:25.111
He's an extraordinary and popular racing horse.

45
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:27.311
We should prepare for a press conference immediately.

46
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:33.011
Actually, they're also making a fuss over something else.

47
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:34.511
What do you mean?

48
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:37.011
"Famous Horse Missing, Kidnapped!"

49
00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:38.011
"100 million yen ransom!"

50
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.811
"Death threats previously received!"

51
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:41.711
"Bloody horse blanket discovered! Is the horse already dead?"

52
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.211
"Massive failure!"

53
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.511
"Kidnapping happened under the watch of a great detective and the police!"

54
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:49.211
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Darn it! Who do they think they are?

55
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:53.911
I hate to say it, but if Tokuyoshi had cooperated,

56
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:56.811
this wouldn't have happened.

57
00:04:56.811 --> 00:05:00.111
You've had too much to drink, dad.

58
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:02.111
How can I not drink?

59
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.011
It's not like I wanted to fail.

60
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:06.211
More importantly,

61
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:10.411
we're still not sure White Spirits was killed, right?

62
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:15.611
Well, yeah, but the blood was a match.

63
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:17.111
I'm sure he's fine.

64
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.611
The kidnapper got the ransom money he wanted.

65
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.611
I'm sure he'll return him.

66
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:30.911
"Saniaki Nagaura, Masao Shiomi" -I know who did it. I'm absolutely certain.

67
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.111
"Yasutaka Hase, Chizuru Kakuta" -So why did they hire the old man?

68
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.811
I'll have to review the case again.

69
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:51.411
What's this?

70
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:56.311
Could it be...

71
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:08.011
I see. So that's how it is.

72
00:06:08.011 --> 00:06:10.611
How did I not notice this?

73
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:19.711
Hello, Officer Takagi?

74
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:23.911
Kogoro asked me to do something for him.

75
00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:27.311
Over here.

76
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.411
Hey, Conan.

77
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:33.911
Please play the tape.

78
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:34.911
Got it.

79
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:42.811
This is it. Stop the video.

80
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:46.511
This is the trailer the real White Spirits was in.

81
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:48.911
Which means we might know where it went

82
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:52.311
if we follow it on the other security camera.

83
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.811
I'm impressed Mouri noticed.

84
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:57.911
Is he really in there?

85
00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:01.711
Are we sure the real White Spirits was in this trailer?

86
00:07:01.711 --> 00:07:07.411
Well, we can't see inside the trailer from here, but...

87
00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:10.311
Could you show us that part again?

88
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.311
Sure.

89
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:17.311
Stop the video!

90
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:20.711
Look at this, Officer Takagi.

91
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:23.111
What? The date?

92
00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:25.611
Wait, what? Could it be?

93
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.311
Which means...

94
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:31.911
But why?

95
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.511
There's only one conceivable reason.

96
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:36.011
Now I just need evidence.

97
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:43.511
"Satoshi Ihara (25)" -I'm sorry, I'm still only a trainee.

98
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:47.611
I'm unsure of the details, but...

99
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:50.711
But there's something bothering you, isn't there?

100
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:53.911
One of the horse trailers hasn't come back.

101
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:56.811
Since when?

102
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:58.911
I think it's been three days now.

103
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.011
Three days...

104
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:04.711
Come to think of it, it must be since three days ago.

105
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:06.911
"White Spirits" -I couldn't find White Spirits' spare riding

106
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:10.411
or grooming gear.

107
00:08:10.411 --> 00:08:13.611
So it disappeared along with the horse trailer.

108
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:16.811
Where was White Spirits then? Here?

109
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:19.811
I'm not sure.

110
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:22.411
I was working with another horse that day,

111
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:25.011
so I was out at the track.

112
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:30.011
But when I returned that night, White Spirits was here.

113
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:33.211
Which means it probably happened then.

114
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.611
Hey, is this a bloodstain?

115
00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:39.911
A bloodstain?

116
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:43.011
Oh, actually...

117
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.611
What happened?

118
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:48.011
It's not a secret or anything.

119
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:50.611
That happened three days ago, too...

120
00:08:50.611 --> 00:08:53.811
No, the day before that.

121
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:58.511
White Spirits rubbed against a splinter that formed there.

122
00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:03.311
But the vet said it fortunately wasn't serious,

123
00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:06.311
and wouldn't affect his ability to race.

124
00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:09.511
I see. So that's how it is.

125
00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:13.111
What's that?

126
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.211
The truth is starting to come together.

127
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:20.011
Hello, Takagi?

128
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:24.511
I need you to convey a message to the inspector immediately.

129
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:26.311
Hello, this is Takagi.

130
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:27.311
Mouri?

131
00:09:37.078 --> 00:09:38.878
What's the meaning of this?

132
00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.878
I thought I said I was through with detectives and the police!

133
00:09:41.878 --> 00:09:44.978
Well, actually...

134
00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:46.378
Takagi,

135
00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:47.778
it better be true

136
00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:50.678
that you discovered the culprits and the truth behind the case.

137
00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:52.778
What? Mouri, you told me to tell the inspector

138
00:09:52.778 --> 00:09:54.678
that you uncovered the culprit's identity

139
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:57.778
and the truth behind the case.

140
00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:00.878
What are you two arguing about?

141
00:10:00.878 --> 00:10:01.978
Either way, it doesn't matter.

142
00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:04.278
Hurry up and explain the situation.

143
00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:05.978
Dad...

144
00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.578
You can do it, old man.

145
00:10:08.578 --> 00:10:11.278
Mouri.

146
00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:12.778
Fine.

147
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.778
Allow me to explain the culprit's identity

148
00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:18.578
and the truth behind the case.

149
00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:19.878
What?

150
00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:22.378
All right.

151
00:10:22.378 --> 00:10:23.778
This case

152
00:10:23.778 --> 00:10:29.378
about the kidnapping of White Spirits and the stolen ransom money

153
00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:33.578
used fundamentally the same trick.

154
00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:34.978
In other words, solve one,

155
00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:37.578
and you've solved the other.

156
00:10:38.978 --> 00:10:41.078
Is that true?

157
00:10:41.078 --> 00:10:44.678
Then quit putting on airs and speak.

158
00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:47.578
First, how was White Spirits

159
00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:49.878
swapped out for another horse?

160
00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:55.578
The driver swapped him for the horse

161
00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.878
in the other identical trailer parked on the side road.

162
00:10:57.878 --> 00:11:00.078
Since his wife and child were kidnapped,

163
00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:03.278
he was forced to follow the culprit's instructions.

164
00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:05.378
Isn't that right?

165
00:11:05.378 --> 00:11:07.078
Yes.

166
00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:09.878
Takagi, what did you see there?

167
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.478
I believe it was...

168
00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:16.178
Tire tracks from two trailers.

169
00:11:16.178 --> 00:11:18.478
It's strange, though.

170
00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.678
What was strange, Conan?

171
00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:26.278
One set of tire tracks was much shallower than the other,

172
00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:29.878
as though nothing were inside it.

173
00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:31.778
What?

174
00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.778
There was a convenience store at the road

175
00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:35.678
leading to the crime scene.

176
00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:36.978
At Mouri's direction,

177
00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:40.178
I investigated the security camera footage.

178
00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:42.678
Did I tell you to do that?

179
00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:44.878
What?

180
00:11:44.878 --> 00:11:46.778
Continue, Takagi.

181
00:11:46.778 --> 00:11:48.178
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:48.178 --> 00:11:50.878
I found footage of a horse trailer exiting that side road

183
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:54.578
and passing in front of the convenience store.

184
00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:56.778
Then that must have been it.

185
00:11:56.778 --> 00:11:59.778
What about White Spirits? Was he inside?

186
00:11:59.778 --> 00:12:03.078
Unfortunately, I was unable to confirm that.

187
00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:06.978
But more importantly, the footage was from three days ago.

188
00:12:06.978 --> 00:12:08.378
What?

189
00:12:08.378 --> 00:12:11.678
Which means it's possible the trailer and tire marks

190
00:12:11.678 --> 00:12:16.278
were a camouflage created three days earlier.

191
00:12:16.278 --> 00:12:17.578
In other words,

192
00:12:17.578 --> 00:12:21.278
the other trailer wasn't on the side road that day,

193
00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:23.678
but made to look like it was.

194
00:12:23.678 --> 00:12:26.378
The culprit did this to make us believe

195
00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:28.678
the horses were swapped, and...

196
00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:32.378
No, but White Spirits was actually

197
00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:35.378
swapped out for the impostor, so...

198
00:12:35.378 --> 00:12:38.178
Wait. Which means they were swapped not there,

199
00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:40.178
but someplace else.

200
00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:44.478
Could it be that they were swapped all along?

201
00:12:44.478 --> 00:12:47.378
-What? -What?

202
00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:49.278
-No way. -Yes.

203
00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:51.678
That's what makes this case similar to

204
00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.578
"The Adventure of Silver Blaze."

205
00:12:54.778 --> 00:12:56.778
I actually investigated another stable

206
00:12:56.778 --> 00:12:58.778
at Mouri's direction, too.

207
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.678
What? You, too?

208
00:13:02.878 --> 00:13:03.878
Continue.

209
00:13:03.878 --> 00:13:05.378
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:10.678
Currently at that stable is this horse.

211
00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:16.678
It's that horse that looks exactly like White Spirits.

212
00:13:16.678 --> 00:13:19.178
This is White Legion.

213
00:13:19.178 --> 00:13:21.378
He's the brother of White Spirits.

214
00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:22.578
Brother?

215
00:13:22.578 --> 00:13:24.978
I see. I've got it.

216
00:13:24.978 --> 00:13:29.078
In other words, the horses weren't swapped there.

217
00:13:29.078 --> 00:13:35.778
The disguise placed on White Spirits' brother was removed.

218
00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:37.178
That's right.

219
00:13:38.978 --> 00:13:42.078
Conan found this there.

220
00:13:42.078 --> 00:13:44.078
Horse hair?

221
00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:45.678
Yes. According to forensics,

222
00:13:45.678 --> 00:13:48.178
one is White Spirits' hair used in the disguise.

223
00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:52.578
The other belongs to White Legion.

224
00:13:52.578 --> 00:13:57.578
They probably both fell out when the disguise was removed.

225
00:13:57.578 --> 00:14:01.178
Which means the culprits are the people

226
00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:05.978
who dragged me into this by hiring me,

227
00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.678
setting me up to fail,

228
00:14:07.678 --> 00:14:09.478
and made horse owner Tokuyoshi shun my and the police's protection

229
00:14:09.478 --> 00:14:12.678
and attempt to pay the ransom money alone.

230
00:14:12.678 --> 00:14:15.278
Stable hand Saniaki Nagaura.

231
00:14:15.278 --> 00:14:17.378
Trainer Yasutaka Hase.

232
00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:19.578
Jockey Chizuru Kakuta.

233
00:14:19.578 --> 00:14:23.178
You three.

234
00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:25.878
Is this true, Mouri?

235
00:14:25.878 --> 00:14:27.578
How dare you?

236
00:14:29.978 --> 00:14:33.078
You think you've used the great Kogoro Mouri,

237
00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:35.178
but you haven't at all!

238
00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:36.778
He couldn't do it.

239
00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:39.078
I thought I'd let the old man handle this one

240
00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.978
since he loves horses, but...

241
00:14:48.678 --> 00:14:50.278
What? Is this it?

242
00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:54.378
It took a little longer this time...

243
00:14:58.078 --> 00:14:59.078
Mouri?

244
00:14:59.078 --> 00:15:00.478
Dad?

245
00:15:03.978 --> 00:15:05.678
Excuse me.

246
00:15:05.678 --> 00:15:10.078
It's true that the three of you committed this crime.

247
00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:12.978
I had Takagi and Chiba confirm

248
00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.778
that you have no alibis

249
00:15:14.778 --> 00:15:16.978
for when White Spirits was being transported.

250
00:15:16.978 --> 00:15:19.778
Nor for three days earlier,

251
00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:22.678
when White Spirits and a horse trailer

252
00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:24.178
temporarily disappeared from the stable.

253
00:15:24.178 --> 00:15:27.078
White Spirits was probably already swapped out

254
00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:30.678
for White Legion at this time.

255
00:15:30.678 --> 00:15:32.178
There's one more person.

256
00:15:32.178 --> 00:15:34.178
Trailer driver Shiomi,

257
00:15:34.178 --> 00:15:35.978
you're also their accomplice.

258
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:40.378
If there wasn't a second trailer on that side road,

259
00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:43.178
that ruins your whole testimony.

260
00:15:43.178 --> 00:15:49.678
Or were your wife and child pretending to be kidnapped, too?

261
00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:53.178
However, there's a ringleader,

262
00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:55.778
a mastermind behind this plot.

263
00:15:55.778 --> 00:15:58.778
You, Kozo Tokuyoshi.

264
00:15:58.778 --> 00:16:00.278
What?

265
00:16:00.278 --> 00:16:02.078
Is that true, dad?

266
00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:05.678
Well, well.

267
00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:09.578
When did you become the great confused detective?

268
00:16:09.578 --> 00:16:11.578
I'm the victim who was made to pay

269
00:16:11.578 --> 00:16:16.278
a 100 million ransom for a mere horse.

270
00:16:16.278 --> 00:16:19.078
A mere horse?

271
00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:22.178
Hard to imagine a horse owner saying that,

272
00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:27.178
especially when you haven't actually paid a single yen.

273
00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:30.578
What? What does that mean, Mouri?

274
00:16:30.578 --> 00:16:34.778
Remember that none of us checked to see

275
00:16:34.778 --> 00:16:37.178
if there was actually 100 million yen inside that back.

276
00:16:37.178 --> 00:16:39.378
You're right.

277
00:16:39.378 --> 00:16:43.678
The bag Tokuyoshi took was filled with worthless stuffing.

278
00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:45.578
Just as it was a different horse

279
00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:48.478
inside the trailer all along,

280
00:16:48.478 --> 00:16:50.878
he pretended the bag stuffed with magazines

281
00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:53.778
contained 100 million yen.

282
00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:55.378
What?

283
00:16:55.378 --> 00:16:57.478
-Conan. -Here.

284
00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:02.678
You stuffed the magazines in the rack in your living room

285
00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:05.078
inside the bag, didn't you?

286
00:17:05.078 --> 00:17:07.778
You left behind part of a ripped cover.

287
00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:11.678
If there are any ripped magazines inside the bag,

288
00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:13.278
and it matches that...

289
00:17:13.278 --> 00:17:14.878
Which means...

290
00:17:14.878 --> 00:17:16.278
Could it be?

291
00:17:16.278 --> 00:17:17.378
Yes.

292
00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:20.078
It was all a lie.

293
00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:23.078
But why?

294
00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:24.378
Chiba!

295
00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:25.378
Yes, sir.

296
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.678
Mouri asked me to look into it.

297
00:17:27.678 --> 00:17:29.578
Someone requested a payout of the life insurance policy

298
00:17:29.578 --> 00:17:33.278
on White Spirits with a major foreign insurance company.

299
00:17:33.278 --> 00:17:37.278
The beneficiary is Kozo Tokuyoshi.

300
00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:39.778
The problem lies in the date the money was requested.

301
00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:44.178
It was the day before White Spirits' horse blanket was found.

302
00:17:44.178 --> 00:17:47.478
The day before? Wait a minute.

303
00:17:48.978 --> 00:17:49.978
Yes.

304
00:17:49.978 --> 00:17:51.678
How did you know

305
00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:55.878
White Spirits was dead at that time, Tokuyoshi?

306
00:17:55.878 --> 00:18:01.478
Because they threatened to kill White Spirits.

307
00:18:01.478 --> 00:18:04.878
Really? Surely you didn't really think

308
00:18:04.878 --> 00:18:06.378
you'd be paid the insurance money

309
00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.778
over such uncertain circumstances.

310
00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:15.478
It's actually because your employees reported to you

311
00:18:15.478 --> 00:18:18.478
that they'd killed White Spirits, isn't it?

312
00:18:20.578 --> 00:18:22.278
That's right.

313
00:18:22.278 --> 00:18:24.178
You...

314
00:18:24.178 --> 00:18:25.778
I know nothing of this.

315
00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:28.778
They kidnapped him on their own.

316
00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:31.478
I'm innocent. I'm a victim.

317
00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:35.578
And ultimately, White Spirits is dead.

318
00:18:35.578 --> 00:18:38.478
They killed him.

319
00:18:38.478 --> 00:18:41.878
It's within my rights to request the insurance money.

320
00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:43.678
Yes, that's right.

321
00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:48.178
But only if White Spirits really is dead.

322
00:18:48.178 --> 00:18:49.678
What?

323
00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:51.378
What do you mean, dad?

324
00:18:51.378 --> 00:18:52.378
Could it be?

325
00:18:58.578 --> 00:19:00.578
White Spirits!

326
00:19:00.578 --> 00:19:03.278
He's okay. What a relief.

327
00:19:03.278 --> 00:19:04.778
Impossible.

328
00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:06.678
You knew?

329
00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.078
Yes.

330
00:19:08.078 --> 00:19:10.278
While acting according to Tokuyoshi's

331
00:19:10.278 --> 00:19:14.478
White Spirits kidnapping and murder plot,

332
00:19:14.478 --> 00:19:15.778
in the end,

333
00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:19.678
you hid White Spirits in a safe place rather than killing him.

334
00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:25.078
And to increase the credibility of your report to Tokuyoshi,

335
00:19:25.078 --> 00:19:26.778
you left an anonymous tip with the police

336
00:19:26.778 --> 00:19:30.678
so they'd discover the horse blanket White Spirits bled on

337
00:19:30.678 --> 00:19:33.378
when he scratched himself at the stables.

338
00:19:33.378 --> 00:19:34.778
What?

339
00:19:37.178 --> 00:19:41.078
Where has White Spirits been until now?

340
00:19:41.078 --> 00:19:43.478
-Conan! -Here!

341
00:19:43.478 --> 00:19:44.878
Did you bring it?

342
00:19:44.878 --> 00:19:46.478
Yeah, you mean this?

343
00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:52.178
This photo wasn't taken at Tokuyoshi Stables.

344
00:19:52.178 --> 00:19:54.278
The color of the wall is different.

345
00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:55.678
It's Kitado Stables.

346
00:19:55.678 --> 00:19:58.778
We used to work there.

347
00:19:58.778 --> 00:20:02.978
White Spirits and White Legion were born there.

348
00:20:02.978 --> 00:20:05.278
So he's been there until now?

349
00:20:05.278 --> 00:20:09.878
Yes. The trailer I used to transport White Spirits is there, too.

350
00:20:09.878 --> 00:20:13.378
But why did you do this?

351
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.978
Isn't it obvious, inspector?

352
00:20:16.978 --> 00:20:21.278
Because for them, he's not a mere horse.

353
00:20:22.478 --> 00:20:25.078
We were bought with money.

354
00:20:25.078 --> 00:20:27.878
That man, Kozo Tokuyoshi,

355
00:20:27.878 --> 00:20:31.078
poached us and White Spirits.

356
00:20:31.078 --> 00:20:36.378
But I loved White Spirits, as a jockey.

357
00:20:36.378 --> 00:20:38.378
As a stable hand.

358
00:20:38.378 --> 00:20:39.678
As a trainer.

359
00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:48.178
You must've raised White Spirits

360
00:20:48.178 --> 00:20:50.578
since the day he was born.

361
00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:52.878
Tokuyoshi, who was under financial strain

362
00:20:52.878 --> 00:20:54.778
due to some reckless foreign investments,

363
00:20:54.778 --> 00:20:58.078
planned to fake the kidnapping of and ultimately kill White Spirits

364
00:20:58.078 --> 00:21:01.578
in order to fraudulently obtain a huge insurance payout.

365
00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:03.478
He used the debts his employees owned

366
00:21:03.478 --> 00:21:06.578
to force them to carry out the crime.

367
00:21:06.578 --> 00:21:08.578
In order to stop him,

368
00:21:08.578 --> 00:21:10.778
they disguised themselves and hired the old man

369
00:21:10.778 --> 00:21:13.878
to protect White Spirits.

370
00:21:13.878 --> 00:21:15.778
"Great Detective Kogoro Mouri" -With a great detective on the case,

371
00:21:15.778 --> 00:21:19.678
they assumed Tokuyoshi would cancel his plans.

372
00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:22.378
However, Tokuyoshi believed having a famous detective nearby

373
00:21:22.378 --> 00:21:25.478
would help him play the victim

374
00:21:25.478 --> 00:21:27.878
and carried out his plan.

375
00:21:27.878 --> 00:21:30.678
They pretended to follow his plan

376
00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:33.278
and hid White Spirits instead,

377
00:21:33.278 --> 00:21:37.178
hoping to reveal the truth and that White Spirits was safe

378
00:21:37.178 --> 00:21:40.678
once Tokuyoshi requested the insurance money.

379
00:21:58.678 --> 00:22:00.478
Tokuyoshi was arrested

380
00:22:00.478 --> 00:22:03.178
and his employees were questioned,

381
00:22:03.178 --> 00:22:05.178
but the police later chose not to prosecute them

382
00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:07.078
due to their circumstances.

383
00:23:31.178 --> 00:23:37.278
Later, White Spirits returned to racing under a new owner.

384
00:23:47.078 --> 00:23:49.178
White Spirits!

385
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:50.978
You can do it!

386
00:23:54.778 --> 00:23:57.678
"Next Episode" -What? Ms. Sadako!

387
00:23:57.678 --> 00:24:00.278
She was killed last night.

388
00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:01.378
Last night?

389
00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:02.578
Is there a problem?

390
00:24:02.578 --> 00:24:07.278
Then Detective Kogoro Mouri might know something.

391
00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:10.478
While these three are suspicious,

392
00:24:10.478 --> 00:24:13.278
the culprit isn't one of them.

393
00:24:13.278 --> 00:24:15.878
It's all three of them.

394
00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:20.378
