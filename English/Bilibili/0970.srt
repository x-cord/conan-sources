Ran won travel vouchers in a lottery,
so we came to Kanazawa for sightseeing.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,830
While there, we ran into Hayashi Mari-san,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:10,870
who was transporting ransom
money for a kidnapping case.

00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,330
Hayashi Mari (23)
who was transporting ransom
money for a kidnapping case.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,460
The hostage Saikawa Manabu-san was released,

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,500
and we were initially relieved, but...

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,290
Saikawa Manabu (55)
and we were initially relieved, but...

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:18,820
and we were initially relieved, but...

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,700
It became clear that the kidnapping was an
act put on by Manabu-san, and he fled.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,680
The police are pursuing him, and it's only
a matter of time before the case is solved.

Hayashi Soichi (52)

The police are pursuing him, and it's only
a matter of time before the case is solved.

00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,770
At least, it should have been...

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,890
You think you'll get away with this?

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,620
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,500
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,370
Too many mysteries for one kidnapping case!

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,220
Don't let the silks become
stained with malice!

It's Mari-san.

30
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:41,631
What happened?

31
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,431
I'm not sure.

00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,441
When I came to clean before we open,
I found the president on the ground.

35
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,441
Dad, how's Soichi-san?

36
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,611
He's unconscious, but he'll live.

37
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,201
Good.

38
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:01,331
Hey, where's Rintaro-san?

39
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:04,351
I tried calling him, but he won't answer.

40
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:07,081
He's probably still asleep.

41
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,101
Why does he have to be asleep now?

42
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,461
Mari!

43
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:15,721
Are you okay?

My father... My father...

47
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:23,561
Mister, what did the police say?

48
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:28,981
Since he still had his wallet, it's
unlikely he was attacked by a robber.

49
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:33,071
And they found footprints belonging to
three individuals at the crime scene.

50
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:37,991
One set belongs to the president, but they
still don't know whose the other two are.

51
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:41,341
Does that mean he was attacked by two people?

52
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:42,431
Probably.

53
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,871
Where did President Hayashi go
after we parted ways last night?

54
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:51,671
He went to put the money away
in the safe in his office.

55
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,791
What time was that?

56
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:57,891
I believe it was around 11 PM.

57
00:04:57,891 --> 00:05:00,931
I see. And after that?

58
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,931
I don't know. I went straight to my room.

59
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,781
Mister, what's that?

60
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,821
That's gold dust.

61
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,691
What's it doing here?

62
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:28,451
Come to think of it, I saw gold dust on
Soichi-san when he was being carried away.

63
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,961
Maybe Takumi-san works
with gold dust at his job.

64
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,361
Look at Takumi-san's hands.

65
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,221
They have a rash on them.

66
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,801
It's probably because of lacquer.

67
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,811
And look at his bracelet.

68
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:52,461
It's to prevent static electricity, right?

69
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,731
Kanazawa is famous for its gold foil.

70
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:58,361
Lacquer is used as an adhesive for gold foil,

71
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,211
and static electricity makes
gold foil stick to things,

72
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:03,241
so the bracelet is meant
to prevent that, right?

73
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:04,991
Well?

74
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,351
That's right.

75
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,661
I'm an apprentice in traditional
Kanazawa gold foil crafts.

76
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:11,721
So, what?

77
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:17,001
If your gold dust was stuck to the
president, that means you met with him last night.

78
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,381
Am I wrong?

79
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,511
You think I did it?

80
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,261
I didn't do it!

81
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:26,261
Then why don't you explain why there
was gold dust stuck to the president?

82
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,511
Takumi-san, answer him.

83
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,271
Fine.

84
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:39,031
Last night, I went to the president's
office to steal some money.

85
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:43,961
If he had 30 million yen, I thought he
wouldn't notice if a little bit went missing.

86
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:48,281
But he caught me and
grabbed me by the collar.

87
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,581
That must've been when
the gold dust stuck toâ€”

88
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,311
Why did you do that?

89
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,041
Because I don't have enough money.

90
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,091
What?

91
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:04,331
I burn through all my money trying
to keep up with your spending habits.

92
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,771
Why would you put it like that?

93
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,971
Now, now. Let's calm down.

94
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:12,231
Instead of that, for now let's focus
on the attack on the president.

95
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,391
I told you, I didn't do it!

96
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:18,881
Really? You didn't attack
him to keep him quiet?

97
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,571
I said I didn't do it!

98
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,291
Hey, mister.

99
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,321
What? I'm on a roll right now.

100
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,231
Isn't this sawdust?

101
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:34,081
Do you use sawdust at your job, too?

102
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,331
I don't use that stuff.

103
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,381
Then what is this?

104
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,581
Maybe it's hikiko.

105
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,881
It's a kind of sawdust
passed through a sieve.

106
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,141
Printed silk makers use it to prevent dyeing.

107
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:48,401
Right?

108
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,391
That's right. You're well informed.

109
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,961
I've seen it on TV before.

110
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,401
If that hikiko stuff was on the weapon,

111
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:02,961
then it's likely one of the printed
silk makers Hagino Rintaro

112
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,071
or Saikawa Manabu touched the weapon.

113
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,281
Mari-san, is something wrong?

114
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,801
I-It's nothing.

115
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:12,781
Really?

116
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,671
Hiding it won't do you any good.

117
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,081
Very well. I'll tell you.

118
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:25,091
I saw Manabu-san running off
last night from my window.

119
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:37,441
Why didn't you mention
something so important?

120
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,311
Because...

121
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,821
I knew Manabu-san
would be suspected if I did.

122
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:44,751
Of course he would be!

123
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,081
He resents your father because he
failed to steal the money once.

124
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,441
It's possible he returned last night
to try to steal the money again,

125
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:56,751
ran into the president, and
struck him without thinking.

126
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:01,121
I can't imagine Manabu-san hurting my father!

127
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:06,151
But he did in fact try to trick him out
of his money with a fake kidnapping.

128
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:09,451
We were at fault in that as well!

129
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:10,591
Hey...

130
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:14,731
Why is Mari-san so desperate
to defend Manabu-san?

131
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:21,361
Because to Mari-chan, Manabu-san
is like a foster parent to her.

132
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,731
A foster parent?

133
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,731
When President Hayashi was busy with work,

134
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:32,361
Manabu-san would play with Mari-chan instead.

135
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,431
Really?

136
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:42,251
In any case, he has motive, and he
was witnessed at the crime scene.

137
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,841
A withheld number?

138
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:49,761
Hello?

139
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,331
Put my phone on speaker?

140
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,111
Very well.

141
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:56,761
Listen closely!

142
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,021
I have Rintaro!

143
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:03,631
If you want him returned safely,
give me back my 30 million!

144
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:09,851
What do you mean, you have Rintaro?

145
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:13,781
I'll send you the time and
place for the drop off later!

146
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:17,541
I'm serious this time!

147
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:20,041
Hey, cut out this nonsense!

148
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:25,671
What?

149
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,031
R-Rintaro-san!

150
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,531
Damn that Manabu.

151
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,181
Is he determined not to give up?

152
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:43,491
Mori-san, what should we do?

153
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,811
To be safe, you should
prepare the ransom money.

154
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,431
Very well.

155
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,501
Mari-san, could you show me that photo again?

156
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,081
Thank you.

157
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:06,531
I don't see any clues that will help
us identify where he's being held.

158
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:11,021
What's this?

159
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,581
Hey, Yuko-san.

160
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:17,251
I'd like to ask you something.

161
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,351
What is it?

162
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:23,281
Manabu-san and Rintaro-san are
master and apprentice, right?

163
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,311
Did they get along?

164
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,851
Those two?

165
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:30,831
Well, between the two of us,

166
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:35,861
I don't think Rintaro-kun thought
very highly of Manabu-san.

167
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,871
What? Really?

168
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,461
I secretly follow Rintaro-kun's
social media accounts.

169
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:47,921
Go to hell

170
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:47,961
I wish the master
would die already
Go to hell

171
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:52,721
Seems like Rintaro-san
really dislikes Manabu-san.
I wish the master
would die already
Go to hell

172
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:53,201
I wish the master
would die already
Go to hell

173
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:53,261
But if that's true, then why...?
I wish the master
would die already
Go to hell

174
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,961
But if that's true, then why...?

175
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:57,511
I don't believe this!

176
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:01,201
I trusted you and Manabu-san!

177
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,021
You're the worst!

178
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:06,191
I couldn't resist.

179
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:10,441
Anyone would lose control of themselves
with that much money in front of them.

180
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:11,791
You're lying!

181
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:16,361
You pretended to like me, but you only ever
approached me because you wanted my money!

182
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,561
My father was right!

183
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:21,331
So that's how it is.

184
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:24,451
Which means we'd better find them soon.

185
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:29,991
There weren't any clues identifying
the location in the photo.

186
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,461
The only other clue we have is...

187
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,861
That threatening call just now!

188
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:44,971
I see.

189
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:55,098
Komatsu Station

190
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:56,698
Conan-kun, why did you suddenly
want to come to Komatsu?
Komatsu Station

191
00:12:56,698 --> 00:13:00,268
Conan-kun, why did you suddenly
want to come to Komatsu?

192
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:02,458
I'm curious about something.

193
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:04,458
Curious?

194
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,918
What does that mean?

195
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,588
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:12,588
Manabu-san?!

197
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,218
Wait!

198
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:19,268
Science Hills Komatsu

199
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:22,908
Humanity and Manufacturing
Science Museum

200
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:29,398
Damn. Where did he go?

201
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:34,908
My clothes are soaked!

202
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:37,738
That old fart didn't even
apologize for running into me!

203
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:40,538
Do you know which way he went?

204
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:43,038
Huh? Yeah. He went that way.

205
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,658
Conan-kun, where's Manabu-san?

206
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:55,798
I lost him.

207
00:13:56,238 --> 00:14:00,928
Conan-kun, did you come here
knowing Manabu-san would be here?

208
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:04,438
When I listened to Manabu-san's
threatening call again,

209
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:07,658
I heard airplanes in the background.

210
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:13,098
The only airport near
Kanazawa is Komatsu Airport,

211
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:14,948
so I thought he might be here.

212
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,648
I see.

213
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,088
But we lost him.

214
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,948
Let's call the police and
let them handle the rest.

215
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,458
What's that?

216
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,308
An anthocyanin solution.

217
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:39,348
They were making some at the science
museum's children's lab, so I borrowed a little.

218
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,228
What are you going to do with it?

219
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:46,098
An anthocyanin solution changes
color depending on the pH value.

220
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:50,908
If we spray it someplace Manabu-san
probably passed through...

221
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:52,608
Footprints!

222
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:57,108
The cola Manabu-san spilled when he
ran into that man is a strong acid.

223
00:14:57,358 --> 00:15:03,618
It reacted with the anthocyanin solution,
making his footprints visible.

224
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:07,118
Really? I'm impressed you know that.

225
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:10,938
I-I learned about it in science class.

226
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:20,128
So this is where we're dropping
off the ransom money.

227
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,598
Dad.

228
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,098
What are you doing here?

229
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:28,728
Well, we followed Manabu-san's footprints.

230
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:34,718
Whatever. Dropping off this
ransom money comes first.

231
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,738
You guys wait here. Got it?

232
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,518
Okay.

233
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,968
Rintaro-san.

234
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:08,598
You're all right now.

235
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:08,868
Hagino Rintaro (34)

236
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,588
Y-You saved me.
Hagino Rintaro (34)

237
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:11,608
Hagino Rintaro (34)

238
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:13,248
Thank you.

239
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:17,608
Where's Manabu?

240
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,338
He took his things and ran.

241
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,058
So he was scared of being caught and fled.

242
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:24,278
Rintaro-san.

243
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,618
Ran! And what are all of you doing here?

244
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:31,878
We were worried and couldn't sit still.

245
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:33,378
I see.

246
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:36,078
As you can see, the hostage is all right.

247
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,088
I'm off to find Manabu who ran fromâ€”

248
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,388
Dad?

249
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:49,768
There's something I must make clear first.

250
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:51,518
Huh? What?

251
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:56,278
Rintaro-san, why don't you cut the act?

252
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,778
The act? What are you talking about?

253
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:03,808
You pretending to be a hostage, obviously.

254
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,288
What? What are you talking about?

255
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:11,448
In the photo of you, there was a
rectangular bulge in your pocket.

256
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:15,288
Judging by its shape, it was a smart phone.

257
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:19,298
You're right. But what about this?

258
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,498
Normally a kidnapper would take
a smart phone off a hostage.

259
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,908
But Manabu-san didn't do that.

260
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:27,558
Why not?

261
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:29,358
The answer is simple.

262
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:34,618
Because he wasn't concerned about him
calling for help even if he had a phone on him.

263
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:39,188
In other words, Rintaro-san,
you're working with Manabu-san.

264
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:44,318
Rintaro-san, is that true?

265
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:49,368
I had the police share
your call history with me.

266
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,838
I know you've been communicating frequently
with Manabu-san since last night.

267
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,208
Your excuses won't work.

268
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,838
Impressive work, Sleeping Kogoro.

269
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,408
Why would you do this?

270
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:08,848
I felt bad for my master, so I
decided to help him steal the money.

271
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:11,348
Outwardly, that was your reason.

272
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:13,348
Outwardly?

273
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,358
Rintaro-san knew how to open the safe.

274
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:20,088
If he simply wanted to help,

275
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:23,858
there was no need for them to do something
as drastic as faking a kidnapping.

276
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:28,868
They could have simply stolen
the money from the safe.

277
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:32,368
Then why did Rintaro-san do what he did?

278
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:38,268
Because he planned to pretend to
help Manabu-san before killing him.

279
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,628
N-No...

280
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:48,638
Rintaro-san rather harshly expressed his
hatred for Manabu-san on social media.

281
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:50,908
No. It's not true, is it?

282
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,378
"A craftsman steals his techniques"
is nothing but hazing.

283
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:58,368
It was so hard.

284
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:00,848
But you didn't have to kill him!

285
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,648
You have no right to criticize me.

286
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:07,698
I planned to kill my master,
but I didn't do it.

287
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:11,658
In other words, I'm not a criminal yet.

288
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:14,668
No, you are a criminal.

289
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,318
What are you talking about?

290
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:20,668
There were three sets of footprints found
where President Hayashi was attacked.

291
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,728
One set belonged to President Hayashi,
and another belonged to Manabu-san.

292
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,678
The remaining one is yours.

293
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,678
I don't know anything about that!

294
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:32,018
An examination would clear
things up immediately.

295
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:34,978
B-But just because I was at the crime scene,

296
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:38,898
that doesn't mean I struck the president.

297
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:43,698
No. The rock used as the weapon
was too heavy to lift in one hand.

298
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:47,468
Manabu-san injured his dominant
hand and could only use one.

299
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,998
In other words, you were the
only person at the crime scene

300
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:53,908
who could have struck President Hayashi.

301
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,038
Damn it.

302
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,418
It's the president's fault.

303
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:06,198
Wasn't your target Manabu-san?

304
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:09,428
Why would you do something
so cruel to my father?

305
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:15,808
The president caught me telling
my master to fake a kidnapping.

306
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,158
Without thinking, I grabbed the rock.

307
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:22,808
You can tell the police all about it.

308
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:30,578
But where's Manabu-san?

309
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:34,218
What's that?

310
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,578
Ran, flip over the mat!

311
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,038
A bloodstain.

312
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,208
Probably Manabu-san's.

313
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,708
Where is Manabu-san?!

314
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:54,558
If he already attacked Manabu-san, he
wouldn't have had time to take him outside.

315
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,218
He's probably here somewhere in this room.

316
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,938
Ran, check that closet!

317
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,478
Why would you do this?

318
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:12,308
He probably planned to finish off
Manabu-san after tricking us,

319
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:18,248
making the police continue their search for
the supposedly escaped Manabu-san forever.

320
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:27,838
Manabu-san, I can't believe this happened.

321
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,598
Manabu-san, you're alive.

322
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:37,668
Good.

323
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:06,058
After Rintaro-san and
Manabu-san were arrested,

324
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,438
Soichi-san was able to leave the hospital.

325
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:11,948
Congratulations on your
discharge from the hospital.

326
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:12,878
Thanks.

327
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:16,938
What are you going to do now?
All your craftsmen are gone.

328
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,448
I know. The company is in big trouble.

329
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:22,828
I can't believe this turned
into such a major case.

330
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:26,208
Perhaps I ought to reflect
on my own actions as well.

331
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,208
Let me handle it.

332
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:32,298
I'll follow in Manabu-san and Rintaro-san's
footsteps and become a printed silk maker.

333
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:33,648
You?

334
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:37,358
Yes. Despite how I look, I'm
confident in my artistic ability.

335
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:40,398
These are my artistic skills! Well?

336
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:44,328
Mari, that's fantastic!

337
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:46,978
I had no idea you had such hidden talent!

338
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:49,128
The company's future is secure now!

339
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,588
A new wave printed silk maker is born.
