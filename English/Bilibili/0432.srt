1
00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.567
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:04.367
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:05.967
Too absorbed in solving the case.

4
00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:07.567
The incident and love affair take an unexpected turn.

5
00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.467
Will you be able to do your thing today, Officer Takagi?

6
00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:10.967
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:12.667
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.367
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:58.677
We coincidentally run into Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba

10
00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:01.277
who were attending a social gathering.

11
00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:04.077
However, in the midst of the gathering,

12
00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:07.077
the cousin of one of the participants, Kouta, was kidnapped.

13
00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:10.577
The kidnapper demands...

14
00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:11.777
a million yen.

15
00:02:13.177 --> 00:02:19.077
"Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 2)"

16
00:02:20.377 --> 00:02:22.877
Ransom of a million yen.

17
00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:25.877
Quite a small amount considering the outrageousness of the crime.

18
00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:29.377
Yes. The culprit seems to be friends with Masashi

19
00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:32.077
and he's probably taking his real financial situation into consideration.

20
00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:33.477
Okay, got it.

21
00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:37.177
I'll have investigators stakeout those three people's homes.

22
00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:40.877
Kouta saw the live baseball game on March 26th.

23
00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:43.277
The games during this time is either high school baseball

24
00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:45.077
or the opening of professional baseball.

25
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:49.377
If we can figure out which game it was he referred to as boring that day,

26
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.977
we can probably figure out who the culprit by thinking out the time.

27
00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:54.377
Yes, all right.

28
00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:56.677
Officer Sato, I got it.

29
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.977
There was no professional baseball opening game that day,

30
00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:01.777
but there were three high school games.

31
00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:04.177
Then which of the three is it?

32
00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:07.177
The score of the first game was 7 to 6.

33
00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:10.477
This was a hot game with one come from behind victory after the other.

34
00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:12.177
They played 12 extended games,

35
00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:15.677
which took from 10am till 2pm.

36
00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:18.077
The game is far from boring, is it?

37
00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:19.777
I don't think so either.

38
00:03:19.777 --> 00:03:22.477
The 2nd game ended...

39
00:03:22.477 --> 00:03:23.877
at 4:30pm.

40
00:03:23.877 --> 00:03:25.277
The score was 14 to 5.

41
00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:28.377
One of the teams made one hit after the other and won a fantastic game.

42
00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:32.177
It could be that game, because it's so one-sided and boring.

43
00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:34.177
But the losing school

44
00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:36.377
had a player who's gotten the attention of the professional leagues

45
00:03:36.377 --> 00:03:38.677
who was at bats six times, hit six singles and two homeruns.

46
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.577
He's a great player.

47
00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:41.577
What about the last one?

48
00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:43.977
A competition of pitchers of a game scoring 1 to 2.

49
00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:46.377
Both teams make it out of a pinch time and again.

50
00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:49.677
Then in the bottom of the 9th inning, it is a game-ending homer.

51
00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:52.577
The game ended at exactly 7:00pm.

52
00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:55.177
This game is also interesting enough.

53
00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:58.977
Maybe he was watching a baseball game

54
00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:01.577
on a competing program in the same time slot?

55
00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.077
You know, like on cable television and satellite broadcasts.

56
00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:07.277
That's true.

57
00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:11.077
Between 12pm to 1pm, there was a game on satellite broadcast.

58
00:04:11.077 --> 00:04:12.977
A digest of a major league game.

59
00:04:12.977 --> 00:04:16.977
From 3pm to 5pm was the "Falcons Road to Victory".

60
00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:20.177
A re-run of last year's program on Nichiuri TV.

61
00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:24.677
And on cable TV between 6pm to 7pm, was a special of player Kiyomatsu.

62
00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:28.777
There's no way that the "Nice Game Selection" would be boring.

63
00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:32.777
And "The Road to Victory" sounds like it should be interesting as it is.

64
00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:36.577
Then could it be player Kiyomatsu's talk show?

65
00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:38.877
Mother was watching that program.

66
00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:42.277
It showed all of player Kiyomatsu's homeruns since his debut

67
00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:44.577
and she said it was really good.

68
00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:47.877
Then the only thing left is video tape.

69
00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:50.577
The only thing thinkable is that he was watching video taped baseball game.

70
00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:52.577
I don't think so.

71
00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:54.277
Kouta told me that he turned the television on himself

72
00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:56.577
with the remote controller.

73
00:04:56.577 --> 00:05:00.577
In that case, maybe anticipating that Kouta would do that,

74
00:05:00.577 --> 00:05:03.777
the culprit setup an unrelated baseball video earlier.

75
00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:05.577
To hide what time it was.

76
00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:06.877
Don't be silly.

77
00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:09.477
Kouta's the one who's using the remote controller.

78
00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:12.077
He would find out as soon as he changes the channel.

79
00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:14.377
True.

80
00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:20.177
Are you sure Kouta didn't tell you what time he went to the man's house?

81
00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:24.577
No. It seems that the man strongly told Kouta not to tell anyone.

82
00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:27.877
We somehow managed to get him tell us about the card that he received

83
00:05:27.877 --> 00:05:30.077
as well as the fact that he was taken to the man's house.

84
00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:34.677
Well, if the card that Kouta received was a rare Masked Yaiba card,

85
00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:39.477
wouldn't Mr. Hikita, the modeler, be the most suspicious?

86
00:05:39.477 --> 00:05:46.277
No. It may be a rare card, but it's sold for about 3,000 yen at stores

87
00:05:46.277 --> 00:05:49.377
and can be bought by any adult.

88
00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:54.777
It's far from the premium card that's selling for 800,000 yen.

89
00:05:54.777 --> 00:06:00.577
I remember that Mr. Hikiya said that he sent you a card set,

90
00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:04.477
but could a premium card have been inside the set?

91
00:06:04.477 --> 00:06:06.977
Like I already said, it wasn't there.

92
00:06:06.977 --> 00:06:12.277
Speaking of premium, Mr. Satsuka said he sent 30,000 yen to you by mail,

93
00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:15.377
but could bills with matching numbers have been inside?

94
00:06:15.377 --> 00:06:16.677
I wonder.

95
00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:20.677
I don't really bother looking at the numbers on bills.

96
00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:23.377
The same goes for the lottery tickets that Rokuda sent me.

97
00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:25.077
I'm not interested in stuff like that.

98
00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:28.077
Yes, it could be movies.

99
00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:32.077
Maybe that baseball game was a scene in a movie or a drama?

100
00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:34.377
Right. Could you check along that line?

101
00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:37.877
Yes. Movies and dramas on that day are...

102
00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:39.577
It's all love stories.

103
00:06:39.577 --> 00:06:41.277
"Extramarital Affairs are Great".

104
00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:44.577
One about an aristocratic group date, "Lovers Who Don't Jive".

105
00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:48.377
One about lovers separating, "Fleeting Spring".

106
00:06:48.377 --> 00:06:51.377
These are the programs that were aired that day.

107
00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:54.177
I came for the food.

108
00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:57.477
I came not knowing it was going to be a social gathering.

109
00:06:57.477 --> 00:06:59.477
Unlike somebody I know.

110
00:06:59.477 --> 00:07:02.177
Well, you see...

111
00:07:02.177 --> 00:07:04.077
And what's with those clothes of yours?

112
00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:05.677
Were you trying to show off?

113
00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:09.677
Talk for yourself, Officer Sato. What's with the makeup?

114
00:07:09.677 --> 00:07:10.877
This?

115
00:07:10.877 --> 00:07:12.577
Yumi forced me to put makeup on!

116
00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:13.977
Same with me!

117
00:07:13.977 --> 00:07:15.877
Officer Chiba forced me, too.

118
00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:18.477
Although it's not important at this point.

119
00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:21.477
Right. It's not important.

120
00:07:21.477 --> 00:07:24.277
Hey, what do you guys think you're doing?

121
00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:28.777
Yes.

122
00:07:28.777 --> 00:07:31.077
This is Megure. How are things?

123
00:07:31.077 --> 00:07:36.077
Well, we can't seem to locate any boring game that was aired that day.

124
00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:39.477
Hey. The officers are staking the houses of the three

125
00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:41.877
and ready to storm in at any time.

126
00:07:41.877 --> 00:07:44.577
The more time passes, the more the boy's life is in danger.

127
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:49.377
I'm back!

128
00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:52.177
Kouta?

129
00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:55.077
Are you all right?

130
00:07:55.077 --> 00:07:56.777
Are you hurt?

131
00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.877
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:58.877 --> 00:08:01.377
I was riding in the car of the man that I met the other day,

133
00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:03.177
but I got tired and fell asleep.

134
00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:06.377
Where does he live? Where is his apartment?

135
00:08:06.377 --> 00:08:08.477
Who's this lady?

136
00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:09.577
She's a police officer.

137
00:08:09.577 --> 00:08:11.077
Please tell me, Kouta.

138
00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:15.677
But I promised the man that I won't tell.

139
00:08:15.677 --> 00:08:18.977
That man is a bad man who kidnapped you,

140
00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:20.577
so please tell me!

141
00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:21.577
But...

142
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.277
Who cares?

143
00:08:24.277 --> 00:08:25.977
He's come home safely.

144
00:08:25.977 --> 00:08:28.677
One of my friends played a prank after all.

145
00:08:28.677 --> 00:08:32.177
Though the prank was in bad taste.

146
00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:34.577
This is not something you can put aside as just a prank.

147
00:08:34.577 --> 00:08:37.377
What's up? Is something wrong?

148
00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:41.777
Well, the boy who was thought to have been kidnapped came home.

149
00:08:41.777 --> 00:08:44.577
What? Don't tell me that you gave the 1 million yen?

150
00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:47.777
No, the culprit hasn't contacted us at all yet.

151
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.777
Masashi doesn't even intend to hand over the money.

152
00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:54.977
It's already late, Kouta.

153
00:08:54.977 --> 00:08:57.677
Let's talk tomorrow. It's time to go to bed.

154
00:08:57.677 --> 00:08:58.677
Okay.

155
00:09:06.977 --> 00:09:08.077
Kouta.

156
00:09:09.377 --> 00:09:11.777
What happened to your socks?

157
00:09:11.777 --> 00:09:13.277
They look wet.

158
00:09:14.377 --> 00:09:15.877
This?

159
00:09:15.877 --> 00:09:21.977
I remembered that Masashi told me not to accept anything from strangers.

160
00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.777
After saying goodbye to the man with the beard,

161
00:09:24.777 --> 00:09:28.177
I went to give the card back to him.

162
00:09:28.177 --> 00:09:30.877
But the man wasn't in the room

163
00:09:30.877 --> 00:09:33.077
and a man that I didn't know was taking a bath.

164
00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:35.177
A stranger in the bath tub?

165
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:40.777
So why don't we leave the rest to the police?

166
00:09:40.777 --> 00:09:42.677
It's time for the sports news.

167
00:09:42.677 --> 00:09:45.277
I'd like to see the results of the World Cup preliminaries.

168
00:09:45.277 --> 00:09:47.677
May I watch the television for a while?

169
00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:50.177
Yes, go right ahead.

170
00:09:50.177 --> 00:09:54.577
Well, it's 0 to 0 and a draw, but it was a good game nonetheless!

171
00:09:54.577 --> 00:09:56.677
What? It's 0 to 0.

172
00:09:56.677 --> 00:09:59.377
I guess they did pretty good for an away from home game.

173
00:09:59.377 --> 00:10:01.877
Scoreless draw.

174
00:10:01.877 --> 00:10:05.077
I see. That's why Kouta...

175
00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:07.377
He's the culprit after all.

176
00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:24.865
Didn't I already tell you?

177
00:10:24.865 --> 00:10:28.265
This is a stupid prank that one of my friends pulled off.

178
00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:32.465
He probably just wanted to see me get all worked up by taking Kouta away.

179
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.365
Besides, Kouta is back, isn't he?

180
00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:39.165
But on top of demanding a million yen,

181
00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:40.765
the kidnapper sent mail saying,

182
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.665
"If you call the police, I'll kill Kouta."

183
00:10:43.665 --> 00:10:48.065
This is obviously blackmail and cannot be overlooked as a simple prank.

184
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.665
Besides, it was your voice that was heard from the answer phone

185
00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:52.065
of the culprit's home.

186
00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:56.665
The suspects have been narrowed down to the three men that you called,

187
00:10:56.665 --> 00:10:58.365
so we can't overlook this.

188
00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:00.865
Come on, Kouta.

189
00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:03.365
Let's go to the homes of the three men.

190
00:11:03.365 --> 00:11:05.865
Even if the culprit were to have been under disguise,

191
00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.865
if you go inside, you'd know whose room it is, won't you?

192
00:11:08.865 --> 00:11:10.665
-But... -Hey!

193
00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:12.565
I keep telling you it's okay already.

194
00:11:12.565 --> 00:11:15.465
Don't tell me that when you went to the homes of the three,

195
00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:16.765
you secretly gave away the ransom.

196
00:11:16.765 --> 00:11:20.465
If I gave it away, the officer would've found out long ago.

197
00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:23.165
But there must've been something.

198
00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:26.065
Maybe there was something of value in the things they sent you

199
00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:27.565
and you returned it or something.

200
00:11:27.565 --> 00:11:29.665
Like I already told you...

201
00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:30.865
Huh?

202
00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:33.565
Look at this picture on Aya's mail!

203
00:11:33.565 --> 00:11:36.665
Hey, what are you looking at Conan?

204
00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:40.865
An illustrator friend of mine often sends me these joke messages.

205
00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:43.065
Gosh. Behave yourself, Conan!

206
00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:47.465
But it said to click on the mail.

207
00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:49.865
If I knew what was inside before I opened it,

208
00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:51.265
I wouldn't have done what I did.

209
00:11:52.565 --> 00:11:53.565
You idiot!

210
00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:57.065
You shouldn't open other people's mail no matter what the contents!

211
00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:58.165
Wait.

212
00:11:58.165 --> 00:12:00.765
The kidnapper snuck into the house

213
00:12:00.765 --> 00:12:03.465
knowing that both Masashi and Aya wouldn't be home

214
00:12:03.465 --> 00:12:05.565
and tried to steal something, right?

215
00:12:05.565 --> 00:12:09.265
Which means that Mr. Hikiya who sent the Yaiba card is innocent.

216
00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:14.065
He wouldn't go through all this trouble if he didn't know what was inside.

217
00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:15.265
I see.

218
00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:18.165
As for lottery tickets that Mr. Rokuda sent here,

219
00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:22.165
if the winner was a number continuing from the tickets he had himself,

220
00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:24.065
he would know the winning ticket was here.

221
00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:27.465
Yes. And the same can be said of Mr. Satsuka.

222
00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:30.465
If he lost the rare yen bill that he bought,

223
00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:34.965
it wouldn't be strange if he thought that he may have sent it to Masashi.

224
00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:36.465
Talking of sending things,

225
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:41.465
Pops also received a bottle wrapped in shiny paper the other day.

226
00:12:42.565 --> 00:12:44.765
That's called champagne.

227
00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:48.165
A client sent it to us as a token of thanks for solving a case.

228
00:12:48.165 --> 00:12:50.765
It's juice, right? I want to drink it, too.

229
00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:53.765
It's liquor, children can't drink it.

230
00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:55.965
Besides, dad drank it all up already.

231
00:12:57.265 --> 00:12:58.865
I guess it can't be helped then.

232
00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:00.165
That's right.

233
00:13:00.165 --> 00:13:03.065
If it's liquor, Pops will open it as soon as he gets it

234
00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:05.065
and puts into his stomach.

235
00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:06.365
Wait a second.

236
00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:09.065
If money is sent by using registered mail for cash,

237
00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:11.865
we would open it right away and put the cash in our wallet.

238
00:13:11.865 --> 00:13:17.165
If so, if there were any rare yen bills, it would be in Masashi's wallet.

239
00:13:17.165 --> 00:13:19.465
So coming into the house to get it back won't help.

240
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.365
If so, the suspicious one is...

241
00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:25.965
Mr. Rokuda who sent the lottery tickets.

242
00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:27.865
It can't be.

243
00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:31.665
Because I'm not interested in lottery tickets and I might throw them away.

244
00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:32.965
I wonder.

245
00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:37.265
You could've left it on your desk without opening the envelope.

246
00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:38.765
I see.

247
00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:41.565
Since you don't care about them, you might not notice if they were gone.

248
00:13:41.565 --> 00:13:45.665
You might not even realize that they had been stolen either.

249
00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:46.965
Hold it.

250
00:13:46.965 --> 00:13:48.465
Aren't you forgetting something?

251
00:13:48.465 --> 00:13:54.265
Kouta said he watched a boring baseball game at that man's apartment.

252
00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:57.665
I called Rokuda's house on that day after noon.

253
00:13:57.665 --> 00:13:59.465
The games that were playing then

254
00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:03.065
was a hot high school baseball game with reversal after reversal,

255
00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:06.765
and a Major League program called "Nice Game Selection". Only those two.

256
00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:10.065
Hey, Kouta. The one you saw was boring, right?

257
00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:12.865
Yes. It wasn't fun at all.

258
00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:15.965
Look. There's no way that Rokuda is the culprit.

259
00:14:15.965 --> 00:14:21.265
But "Safe Game" is written by the program "Nice Game Selection".

260
00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:24.665
If it's "safe", maybe it's not exciting, but boring.

261
00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.465
Stupid!

262
00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.965
That Kanji character is read as "complete", not "safe".

263
00:14:28.965 --> 00:14:30.865
In other words, it's a perfect game,

264
00:14:30.865 --> 00:14:34.065
It's when the pitcher doesn't let the opposing batters score even one hit.

265
00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:36.765
It's an exciting game.

266
00:14:36.765 --> 00:14:37.765
Don't tell me that...

267
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:41.465
It's true that a complete game is exciting,

268
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:43.765
but it may look to be a boring game to children

269
00:14:43.765 --> 00:14:46.265
who don't know much about baseball.

270
00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:49.165
Moreover, with a broadcast slot of only an hour,

271
00:14:49.165 --> 00:14:51.165
most of the offensive play of the players on the pitcher's team

272
00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:52.665
were probably edited and cut.

273
00:14:52.665 --> 00:14:56.065
It would only show scenes of the opposing batters getting out.

274
00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:59.065
I can understand why he would think the game to be boring.

275
00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.565
Kouta, that's how it was, right?

276
00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:02.865
Yeah.

277
00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:04.865
The batters kept getting three strikes,

278
00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:06.965
so everyone was just getting outs.

279
00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:11.865
Then I guess Mr. Rokuda is the kidnapper.

280
00:15:11.865 --> 00:15:12.865
Wait.

281
00:15:12.865 --> 00:15:15.765
Even if Rokuda were to be the culprit, it's attempted kidnap, right?

282
00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:17.865
He didn't take money from me.

283
00:15:17.865 --> 00:15:20.265
Besides, it seems as if he needs money,

284
00:15:20.265 --> 00:15:22.265
so I'm sure he just impulsively did it.

285
00:15:22.265 --> 00:15:27.465
You knew that a winning ticket was in there, didn't you?

286
00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:29.765
Knowing that he was in need of money,

287
00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:32.965
so you sent the tickets back to him that is still in the envelope.

288
00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.565
But not knowing that, Mr. Rokuda came into the house,

289
00:15:36.565 --> 00:15:40.165
panicked after seeing that the envelope was gone and kidnapped Kouta.

290
00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:46.065
And because of his situation, you suspected Mr. Rokuda from the beginning.

291
00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:48.665
Then you suggested going to his house.

292
00:15:48.665 --> 00:15:51.965
Seeing the mailbox jam packed with mail...

293
00:15:51.965 --> 00:15:58.165
Maybe there's something good in that bulging mailbox of yours.

294
00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:00.065
Isn't this how it was?

295
00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:01.565
Am I wrong?

296
00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:07.465
Yeah, you're right. Exactly.

297
00:16:07.465 --> 00:16:09.165
Who cares?

298
00:16:09.165 --> 00:16:11.765
He's the one who bought the lottery tickets to begin with anyway.

299
00:16:11.765 --> 00:16:16.465
Besides, he's the only one that's still into music without quitting.

300
00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:18.965
It was our dream.

301
00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:22.265
Our group from long ago.

302
00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:24.965
We all quit because it's getting tougher.

303
00:16:24.965 --> 00:16:27.065
Except him.

304
00:16:27.065 --> 00:16:30.965
So please give him a break this time, officer.

305
00:16:30.965 --> 00:16:32.265
No.

306
00:16:32.265 --> 00:16:35.465
Kidnapping is a crime that's equal to murder, a very ruthless crime.

307
00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:37.165
I can't forgive him.

308
00:16:37.165 --> 00:16:40.165
Especially since it was just for money.

309
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:44.565
I can't sympathize with one who wants to realize his dream

310
00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:46.765
at the expense of hurting the hearts of others.

311
00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:49.265
Although I feel that it's unfortunate for him.

312
00:16:49.265 --> 00:16:51.565
I guess so.

313
00:16:51.565 --> 00:16:53.965
He's so stupid.

314
00:16:53.965 --> 00:16:57.965
Officer Takagi, we're going to raid Mr. Rokuda's house.

315
00:16:57.965 --> 00:17:01.565
Gosh! What's he doing at a time like this?

316
00:17:01.565 --> 00:17:04.165
Inspector, we've figured out who the kidnapper is!

317
00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.765
It's Masashi's childhood friend, Takuji Rokuda!

318
00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:09.765
There is a possibility that he may flee.

319
00:17:09.765 --> 00:17:11.965
If he refuses to come voluntarily, arrest him without a warrant.

320
00:17:11.965 --> 00:17:14.565
No, I can't do that.

321
00:17:14.565 --> 00:17:17.665
Just a while ago, he came running with a pale face.

322
00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:19.265
Who did?

323
00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:24.765
Officer Sato.

324
00:17:24.765 --> 00:17:25.865
Inspector.

325
00:17:25.865 --> 00:17:27.265
It was him. Over there.

326
00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:36.965
Officer Takagi.

327
00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:38.965
What's with all that blood?

328
00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:40.165
Don't tell me

329
00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:43.565
that you went in and fought with the culprit to try to look good.

330
00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:47.765
No, that's the kidnapper blood.

331
00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:49.465
He saved him.

332
00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:52.465
Officer Takagi broke into the room and saved Mr. Rokuda.

333
00:17:55.165 --> 00:17:56.465
Officer Takagi!

334
00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:57.665
Just what do you think you're doing?

335
00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:00.365
Darn it!

336
00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:11.565
Suicide?

337
00:18:11.565 --> 00:18:13.065
He cut his wrist.

338
00:18:13.065 --> 00:18:15.365
He's already been taken away by ambulance.

339
00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:18.565
It seems that he'll make it because he was found early enough.

340
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:21.865
I guess we'll have him come in voluntarily after he recovers.

341
00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:24.965
How did you know he was going to commit suicide?

342
00:18:24.965 --> 00:18:27.865
Kouta's socks.

343
00:18:27.865 --> 00:18:30.465
I asked him why they were wet.

344
00:18:30.465 --> 00:18:32.765
Kouta said when he went back to Mr. Rokuda's place,

345
00:18:32.765 --> 00:18:35.365
but there was a stranger in the bathroom.

346
00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:40.165
Mr. Rokuda released Kouta, removed his disguise

347
00:18:40.165 --> 00:18:43.765
and committed suicide in the bath tub.

348
00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:45.865
The fact that Kouta's socks were wet,

349
00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:48.165
means that he went into the bathtub

350
00:18:48.165 --> 00:18:50.465
and went up to Mr. Rokuda.

351
00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:52.365
If Mr. Rokuda were conscious then,

352
00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:55.265
he wouldn't have let Kouta do so.

353
00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:56.565
I see.

354
00:18:56.565 --> 00:19:00.665
He found the lottery tickets that had been returned in his mailbox.

355
00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:02.865
He realized Mr. Emoto still cared for him

356
00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:06.465
and was unable to endure the weight of the crime he had committed.

357
00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:10.365
It's amazing that you figured out that Takuji Rokuda was the culprit.

358
00:19:10.365 --> 00:19:13.465
I figured that among the mail that was sent to Masashi,

359
00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.865
the only thing you would know the value of beforehand

360
00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:20.565
and could go in later to steal are the lottery tickets.

361
00:19:20.565 --> 00:19:22.965
Then why didn't you tell me about it?

362
00:19:22.965 --> 00:19:24.465
Well...

363
00:19:24.465 --> 00:19:27.365
I wasn't confident about my deduction,

364
00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:30.565
so I thought I'd go check things out first.

365
00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.165
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.665
Inspector Megure, I'll leave the rest up to you.

367
00:19:38.065 --> 00:19:39.165
Officer Sato.

368
00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:44.765
Officer Sato, write a report to submit to headquarters, will you?

369
00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:46.965
What? Yes, sir.

370
00:19:46.965 --> 00:19:48.765
You too, Officer Takagi.

371
00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:49.765
Yes, sir.

372
00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:52.465
I've got to stay here and wait for the search warrant.

373
00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:54.965
You can use my car. Have you been drinking?

374
00:19:54.965 --> 00:19:57.165
I only had soft drinks.

375
00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.165
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:01.165 --> 00:20:02.265
What's with you?

377
00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:04.365
Did you do something that you have to apologize to me about?

378
00:20:04.365 --> 00:20:06.665
But you're angry.

379
00:20:06.665 --> 00:20:08.765
Does it look like I am?

380
00:20:08.765 --> 00:20:11.265
If it's about the social...

381
00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.565
It's okay.

382
00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:15.165
I bet Officer Chiba told you they were short on people

383
00:20:15.165 --> 00:20:17.565
and you couldn't refuse, right?

384
00:20:17.565 --> 00:20:19.465
Well, it did look as if you had some expectations

385
00:20:19.465 --> 00:20:20.965
about the girls who were there.

386
00:20:20.965 --> 00:20:22.965
So you're angry about the incident

387
00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:25.265
that just happened after all, right?

388
00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:28.265
I'm sorry for not telling you, my superior, about it,

389
00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:29.565
and acted on my own.

390
00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:32.165
But by the time I realized what I was doing,

391
00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:33.865
my body was already running of its own accord.

392
00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:36.565
I'm really sorry.

393
00:20:38.665 --> 00:20:40.765
Don't apologize.

394
00:20:40.765 --> 00:20:44.165
You did something way greater than just nab a person.

395
00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:47.165
You did something fantastic.

396
00:20:47.165 --> 00:20:52.065
I'm upset that I wasn't thinking about what the suspect would be feeling.

397
00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:56.465
And I'm mad at myself for fixating only on apprehending him.

398
00:20:56.465 --> 00:20:59.365
And when at the same time some other person could see the big picture,

399
00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:00.765
I couldn't.

400
00:21:00.765 --> 00:21:06.065
I only figured it out because I also buy lottery tickets frequently, so...

401
00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:09.065
The odds are as low as buying lottery tickets.

402
00:21:09.065 --> 00:21:10.465
I mean that both of us who are going out with each other

403
00:21:10.465 --> 00:21:14.465
would be invited separately to a gathering and run into each other there.

404
00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.865
That's true.

405
00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:18.165
I mean, I've never even once won a lottery.

406
00:21:20.065 --> 00:21:23.065
You mean that I'm a losing ticket then?

407
00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:26.965
No, you're a smash hit! Super special huge hit!

408
00:21:26.965 --> 00:21:28.465
Keep your eyes on the road!

409
00:21:29.565 --> 00:21:31.365
You really think so?

410
00:21:31.365 --> 00:21:34.565
Yes. I pledge my heart!

411
00:21:34.565 --> 00:21:39.565
Then will you confirm if I'm a big hit or not?

412
00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:42.465
Yes, it's my pleasure.

413
00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:51.065
Don't tell me that you two have forgotten that we're in the car, too?

414
00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:20.765
Huh? Another social gathering?

415
00:23:20.765 --> 00:23:24.065
That's right. They don't have enough girls again this time.

416
00:23:24.065 --> 00:23:27.265
Yumi, I'm sorry. But this time, I'll pass.

417
00:23:27.265 --> 00:23:29.665
I've had more than enough of my share last time already.

418
00:23:29.665 --> 00:23:33.165
What? There's an all-you-can-eat cake buffet after the meal?

419
00:23:33.165 --> 00:23:35.065
Moreover, the host is treating?

420
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:36.365
I'll go, I'll go.

421
00:23:36.365 --> 00:23:38.665
As soon as I nab the robber of Shinjuku 3-chome,

422
00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:40.565
I'll go dashing over!

423
00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:42.165
Officer Sato.

424
00:23:44.865 --> 00:23:46.865
"Next Episode" -Huh?

425
00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:49.865
Mr. Mikami?

426
00:23:50.965 --> 00:23:52.765
This schedule is...

427
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.365
It looks like the scotch tape was peeled off once and stuck back on again.

428
00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:59.365
There were three keys here just a while ago,

429
00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:01.265
but there's only one now.

430
00:24:01.265 --> 00:24:03.465
At this height...

431
00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:06.265
it's probably impossible to come in from the window.

432
00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:07.365
I see!

433
00:24:07.365 --> 00:24:08.365
I got it!

434
00:24:09.565 --> 00:24:14.865
Next Conan, "Conan: A Strange Child"

435
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.050
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.850
"Gum"

437
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.950
Officer Sato, this time for sure, let's just the two of us...

438
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.150
Miwako, do you want to go sing karaoke?

439
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.796
-Okay. -Yumi, you're really in the way.
