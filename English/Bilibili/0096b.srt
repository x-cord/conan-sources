1
00:00:01.648 --> 00:00:06.398
Now I get it!
That's how this code works!

2
00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:10.078
In which case, this code means...

3
00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:12.658
Oh no! It's out of lead!

4
00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.408
Say, do you have a pen or anything?

5
00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:16.918
There's a fountain pen
in the desk, if that's all right.

6
00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:21.998
Oh, that's strange.
My husband always had it in here.

7
00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:24.508
Even his trick color pens are gone...

8
00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:27.248
How long're you
gonna look at those numbers?

9
00:00:27.248 --> 00:00:30.638
The police are right.
It was the daughter playing around.

10
00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.158
I took our daughter
to the show that day,

11
00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:37.808
so they assumed she entered
those numbers before then.

12
00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:43.818
Meaning your husband didn't use
the phone that day for some reason.

13
00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:45.328
Yes...

14
00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:51.158
Say, the killer poisoned the
victim before everyone left, right?

15
00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:57.658
Yeah. Probably using a capsule
that dissolved during the show.

16
00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:01.998
Then, the victim was stuck
in here the entire time, right?

17
00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:05.948
If it were me, I think I'd try to
leave a clue about who did it...

18
00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:09.908
Oh, but I guess he couldn't!
There were no pens in the room.

19
00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:12.428
All there was was this phone...

20
00:01:12.908 --> 00:01:17.888
How dumb. If the victim used the
phone, he would've called for help.

21
00:01:17.888 --> 00:01:21.938
Yeah, huh? I doubt the
phone was unplugged or anything.

22
00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:23.578
U-Unplugged?

23
00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:25.828
That's it!

24
00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:30.408
The killer locked your husband
in here after unplugging the phone!

25
00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:34.498
Then, it was plugged back in
during all the commotion later on!

26
00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:35.908
But that's...

27
00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.788
All three suspects are magicians.

28
00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:42.618
They could all pull
off such a stealthy trick.

29
00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:45.918
The killer also hid
the phone with the cards.

30
00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:47.578
When the body was found,

31
00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:52.328
it would be clear the phone was
unplugged if someone tried to use it.

32
00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:56.948
And your husband,
poisoned and locked inside,

33
00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:59.428
wanted to leave a clue
about the person responsible.

34
00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:04.438
But the pens were gone,
and the phone unplugged.

35
00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:10.038
The only option left was to use
the redial button to leave a message.

36
00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:15.748
Even when unplugged, as long
as there's power, numbers are saved.

37
00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:22.458
Then, as a hint pointing to this,
he left the two cards on the desk.

38
00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:25.038
Then my husband really
did enter those numbers?

39
00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:28.998
Yes. He re-hid the phone under the cards

40
00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:34.198
because if someone used the phone
later, his number would be erased.

41
00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:39.618
Plus, if the phone stood out too much,
the killer might get rid of it.

42
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:43.058
All that's left is to decipher
this strange number message, but...

43
00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:44.498
Oh, that's why I--

44
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.668
Here you go!

45
00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.578
It's my pen! You wanted
something to write with, right?

46
00:02:50.578 --> 00:02:51.318
Y-Yeah.

47
00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:55.538
Oh! You realized
something interesting again!

48
00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:57.278
Think you could tell us about it?

49
00:02:57.618 --> 00:03:04.448
I-It's nothing much, but look
at this first group of numbers.

50
00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:09.078
1-2-6-8-7-1.

51
00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.918
On its own, it doesn't make much sense,

52
00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:18.408
but if you connect 1, 2, 6,
8, 7, and 1 on the phone pad,

53
00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:20.928
you get a real strange shape!

54
00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:22.388
D!

55
00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:24.888
It's the letter D!

56
00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:27.578
Oh! So that's called a "D"?

57
00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:32.378
Wait a minute! Then the
next one, 3-2-4-8-9 is C!

58
00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:40.198
That's it! These number
sequences write out four characters!

59
00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:47.158
Adding in the 1-3-5-4-8
and 1-3-9-7 should leave us

60
00:03:47.158 --> 00:03:50.398
with the message your
husband left before he died!

61
00:03:53.078 --> 00:03:55.168
DCMAKO?

62
00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.618
MAKO? Could that mean Mako-san?

63
00:03:57.618 --> 00:03:59.408
Yes, most likely.

64
00:03:59.408 --> 00:04:01.908
Then she killed my husband?!

65
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.828
No. This isn't enough to say.

66
00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:08.478
It could be a message
he left for Mako-san,

67
00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:12.288
and we don't know what the
"DC" before "MAKO" means...

68
00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:16.488
You're really amazing to figure
that out from some weird numbers!

69
00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:17.538
You're really something!

70
00:04:17.538 --> 00:04:19.888
Yes. You're really something.

71
00:04:21.658 --> 00:04:23.748
You're really something, Dad!
You're so smart!

72
00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:27.248
Nah, this was a cinch for me!

73
00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:31.068
Ran...

74
00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:35.658
But what is this "DC"?

75
00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:40.328
The only DCs I know are
DC Brand and Washington DC...

76
00:04:40.328 --> 00:04:41.928
Direct current...

77
00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:43.428
Da capo!

78
00:04:44.538 --> 00:04:48.248
You know, the D.C.
that's often in sheet music!

79
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.268
It's read "da capo"!

80
00:04:50.268 --> 00:04:54.498
Come to think of it,
he did play the piano on occasion,

81
00:04:54.498 --> 00:04:56.778
so I think he often read sheet music.

82
00:04:57.198 --> 00:05:00.288
Say, what does "da capo" mean?

83
00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:03.118
It means to go back
to the start and repeat.

84
00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:05.288
R-Repeat?!

85
00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:08.748
Didn't Mako-san leave
with your daughter?!

86
00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:10.748
Yes, to buy clothes!

87
00:05:10.748 --> 00:05:12.708
Can you contact her right away?!

88
00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:16.868
Yes, I can. She has a pager.

89
00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:26.538
Oh, it's from your mom.
She must want us to hurry home.

90
00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.228
Eh? But I still want to stay with you!

91
00:05:30.618 --> 00:05:33.978
After all, we're going
somewhere really fun next, right?

92
00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.478
Yes, I'll take you there.

93
00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:40.378
To an even more wonderful place.

94
00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:44.448
Eh?! Mako-san plans to--

95
00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:47.578
Yes. She probably plans
to kill your daughter.

96
00:05:47.578 --> 00:05:50.158
The "DC Mako" your husband left behind

97
00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:54.078
likely means that Mako-san
intends to repeat her murder!

98
00:05:54.078 --> 00:05:55.158
You can't be serious!

99
00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:58.128
Just call the other two pupils for now!

100
00:05:58.498 --> 00:06:00.378
We'll all split up and search for them!

101
00:06:06.748 --> 00:06:11.748
Ayano! Mako-san!
Where are you? Ayano!

102
00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:12.938
Ayano-chan!

103
00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.248
Ayano!

104
00:06:15.248 --> 00:06:17.318
Ayano-chan!

105
00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:20.578
No use...

106
00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.568
Dammit! Can't find her!

107
00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:25.418
Any luck?!

108
00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.328
No! Can't find them anywhere!

109
00:06:27.328 --> 00:06:30.328
Guess we should ask
the police to search now...

110
00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:32.828
But, why would Mako-san
kill my husband?!

111
00:06:32.828 --> 00:06:35.838
She must have some
connection with that man.

112
00:06:36.248 --> 00:06:41.628
You know, the man with the
black hat in that one photograph.

113
00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:44.138
It was Kinoshita Yoshiro after all...

114
00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:48.748
K-Kinoshita? The genius magician
who died fourteen years ago?

115
00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:51.388
What do you mean by
"after all," Sanada-kun?!

116
00:06:51.388 --> 00:06:55.268
I saw her when I went to
the basement room one night.

117
00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:59.538
Mako was embracing a picture with care.

118
00:06:59.538 --> 00:07:02.648
I thought something was up,
but I never imagined she'd kill.

119
00:07:04.198 --> 00:07:06.828
Still, I'm pathetic.

120
00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:09.538
Even though I was flustered
when we found the body,

121
00:07:09.538 --> 00:07:14.788
I never saw Mako cut the string
on his rings or plug the phone back in.

122
00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:16.538
Oh.

123
00:07:19.828 --> 00:07:21.258
I've been found out?

124
00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:22.868
M-Mako-san!

125
00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:23.758
Ayano!

126
00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:25.378
Ayano!

127
00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.388
Don't worry. She's just asleep.

128
00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:34.248
I was actually going to put her
to sleep for a very long time,

129
00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:35.388
just like my brother.

130
00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:37.398
Brother?

131
00:07:37.398 --> 00:07:41.658
Yes. The Kinoshita Yoshiro
you were just talking about

132
00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:44.538
was my brother, fourteen
years older than me.

133
00:07:44.538 --> 00:07:50.288
At only 20, he had received every
accolade a magician could obtain.

134
00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:56.998
And he was my only family,
after our parents died when I was young.

135
00:07:56.998 --> 00:08:01.948
But then that man destroyed
my brother like a bug!

136
00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.678
Tsukumo Motoyasu
was jealous of his talent!

137
00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:09.038
You can't be serious!
My husband would never--

138
00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:12.288
It's not a lie. I saw it myself.

139
00:08:12.288 --> 00:08:15.998
On that day, fourteen years ago,
he fiddled with the handcuffs

140
00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:18.188
that my brother used in shows.

141
00:08:18.658 --> 00:08:22.908
Immediately after, my brother
drowned in the practice water tank,

142
00:08:22.908 --> 00:08:24.928
because his handcuffs
wouldn't come off.

143
00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:33.408
The incident was swept under
the rug as an accident, of course...

144
00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:39.418
I see. So you became his
pupil to avenge your brother.

145
00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:43.658
Yes. My last name was changed
when I was taken in by relatives,

146
00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:46.418
so he probably never realized.

147
00:08:46.828 --> 00:08:51.158
My brother was killed
right on my 7th birthday.

148
00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:54.128
The birthday when I was left all alone...

149
00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:59.758
That's why I killed him
just before his daughter turned 7.

150
00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:04.118
I revealed my identity to him
after I administered the poison,

151
00:09:04.118 --> 00:09:10.288
but he still seemed calm,
so I threatened to kill his daughter, too.

152
00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:13.278
He suddenly lost his calm and...

153
00:09:13.278 --> 00:09:19.158
I'm sorry! That was the
only way to protect my status!

154
00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:22.418
You can have my life.
Just keep my daughter out of this!

155
00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:28.038
Just as I said, I planned to kill his
daughter, but then I decided not to.

156
00:09:28.038 --> 00:09:30.748
She did nothing wrong, after all.

157
00:09:31.748 --> 00:09:34.248
Still, he was a foolish man.

158
00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:40.658
He naively let me tie his rings
together to show me a new trick,

159
00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:43.868
and he unwittingly
swallowed my poison capsule.

160
00:09:45.658 --> 00:09:48.448
For Japan's greatest
magician, that's a real laugh!

161
00:09:48.448 --> 00:09:50.028
That's not true, Mako.

162
00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:55.788
He knew you were going to kill him.

163
00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:58.498
Y-You're lying!

164
00:09:58.498 --> 00:10:03.448
I told you. I saw you hugging
the photo of your brother.

165
00:10:03.448 --> 00:10:05.748
Our teacher had been with me then.

166
00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:12.298
And then he said, "Don't tell
this to anyone until the time comes."

167
00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:18.498
But you won, Mako.
Your trick completely fooled the police.

168
00:10:18.498 --> 00:10:24.308
And the dying message he left
won't stand as evidence at this point.

169
00:10:25.498 --> 00:10:31.248
Don't ridicule me. I have no
intention of taking the stage now.

170
00:10:31.248 --> 00:10:35.318
I'm going to go to the police
and lower my own curtain on myself.

171
00:10:35.998 --> 00:10:41.578
Plus, it wasn't right for me to make
Ayano-chan share my lot in life.

172
00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:49.208
Afterward, we took Mako-san to the police

173
00:10:49.538 --> 00:10:54.198
and were supposed to return to
the detective agency for a late dinner.

174
00:10:55.948 --> 00:10:58.928
Whoa, it's already after 12:00.

175
00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:00.958
I'm hungry...

176
00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:07.938
Oh no! I forgot to
buy ingredients for dinner!

177
00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:13.788
It's okay! Conan-kun and I'll get
something at the convenience store!

178
00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:17.278
Don't take too long. I'll be waiting.

179
00:11:18.538 --> 00:11:23.578
S-Say, Ran-neechan. This isn't
the way to the convenience store.

180
00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:28.128
If we're lost, we should go
back to the detective agency first.

181
00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:31.128
Yes. We have to go back...

182
00:11:31.128 --> 00:11:32.828
Kudo

183
00:11:32.828 --> 00:11:33.998
...to your house!
Kudo

184
00:11:33.998 --> 00:11:37.888
Kudo

185
00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:42.348
W-What are you talking about?
This is Shinichi-niichan's house!

186
00:11:42.348 --> 00:11:44.868
You're so silly!

187
00:11:44.868 --> 00:11:49.898
I see. So, that's how
you've tricked us all this time.

188
00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:52.398
Isn't that right...

189
00:11:53.498 --> 00:11:54.508
Shinichi?!

190
00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:09.196
You're Shinichi, aren't you?

191
00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:15.976
W-What are you saying?
Of course I'm not Shinichi-niichan!

192
00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:18.026
No, there's no doubt about it!

193
00:12:18.026 --> 00:12:23.146
That reasoning, ability to take action,
and lack of musical knowledge!

194
00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:24.856
You're exactly alike!

195
00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:27.416
But, look closely! I'm a kid!

196
00:12:27.856 --> 00:12:31.466
You probably took a weird drug
Dr. Agasa made or something!

197
00:12:31.466 --> 00:12:34.386
Everything's really adding up!

198
00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:42.106
Quit playing dumb already!
I have so, so much to say to you!

199
00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:45.106
Not good...

200
00:12:45.686 --> 00:12:47.606
Do you have proof?

201
00:12:48.026 --> 00:12:51.066
Don't say crazy things
if you don't have proof.

202
00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:54.066
There's proof right here.

203
00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:01.746
There! I've never seen
such a close look-alike before!

204
00:13:02.186 --> 00:13:03.726
B-But that's...

205
00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:06.936
It's time to fess up, Shinichi!

206
00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:08.506
Oh! Ran-chan!

207
00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:14.586
Why are you in front of
our home so late at night?

208
00:13:15.066 --> 00:13:20.266
S-Shinichi-kun's mother...
When did you return from L.A.?

209
00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.186
Just now. I took the last flight.

210
00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:25.766
Some things came up.

211
00:13:25.766 --> 00:13:30.276
Oh no! If Mom blurts
out too much now...

212
00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:32.776
Oh? Who's that?

213
00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:36.986
Perfect timing.
Let's have your birth mother...

214
00:13:38.486 --> 00:13:40.366
...tell us who you really are!

215
00:13:46.186 --> 00:13:47.166
Oh, my!

216
00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:50.666
It's you, Conan-chan!
It's good to see you again!

217
00:13:51.026 --> 00:13:53.316
Y-You know him?

218
00:13:53.316 --> 00:13:54.026
Yes!

219
00:13:54.026 --> 00:13:59.176
He's my grandfather's brother's
daughter's cousin's uncle's grandson!

220
00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:03.106
But, he says he's
a relative of Dr. Agasa.

221
00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:07.186
Yes! He and I are
very distant relatives!

222
00:14:07.186 --> 00:14:11.066
But doesn't he look too much
like Shinichi when he was little?

223
00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:15.196
You think? Conan-kun
seems much nicer to me...

224
00:14:15.526 --> 00:14:18.106
Your mom's name is
Fumiyo-san, right?

225
00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:18.946
Yeah!

226
00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:22.406
It sounds like a trick.

227
00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:29.036
It's too odd for a grade-schooler
to be so good at figuring things out!

228
00:14:29.356 --> 00:14:32.936
H-He must've picked up
some of Shinichi's qualities!

229
00:14:32.936 --> 00:14:35.046
He used to visit all the time, after all!

230
00:14:35.046 --> 00:14:37.526
He used to hang out with Shinichi?

231
00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:38.306
Right?

232
00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:40.596
I love Shinichi-niichan!

233
00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:43.096
Even so...

234
00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:49.106
Ran-chan. Think about it.
Would Shinichi do something like this?

235
00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:52.606
You're scary, Ran-neechan.

236
00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:54.946
You're scary, Ran-neechan...

237
00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:07.146
Sorry, Conan-kun! I guess
I had the wrong idea, again!

238
00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:09.326
Forget everything I just said!

239
00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:12.526
I'll make you a yummy
Salisbury steak as an apology!

240
00:15:12.526 --> 00:15:13.106
Okay!

241
00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:14.686
Oh, wait!

242
00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:17.816
Could I take him for two or three days?

243
00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:22.066
My vacation starts tomorrow,
and we haven't talked in so long!

244
00:15:24.436 --> 00:15:26.346
Yes, that should be okay.

245
00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:28.726
Well, see you later, Conan-kun!

246
00:15:30.856 --> 00:15:31.856
Good night!

247
00:15:31.856 --> 00:15:33.686
Good night, Ran-neechan!

248
00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:35.106
Be careful!

249
00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:43.186
So, why are you back?

250
00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:46.536
Don't tell me your fight with
Dad this afternoon is the reason why.

251
00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:50.476
Oh, that's some way to talk
to the person who saved your life.

252
00:15:50.476 --> 00:15:52.026
Saved my life?

253
00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.046
I heard from Dr. Agasa

254
00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:57.436
that you took baths with Ran-chan!

255
00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:58.976
If I hadn't covered for you,

256
00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:01.966
who knows what her
karate would've done to you!

257
00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:07.106
Right?

258
00:16:09.896 --> 00:16:13.556
Anyways, I hope you told
Dad you were coming here.

259
00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:15.526
Of course I didn't.

260
00:16:15.526 --> 00:16:16.936
Hey, now!

261
00:16:16.936 --> 00:16:21.066
It's alright! I'm going
to live with you for a while!

262
00:16:21.066 --> 00:16:23.686
Geez! Don't get me involved, too!

263
00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:31.076
But whenever I'm with mini-you,
I feel young again, too!

264
00:16:35.686 --> 00:16:40.526
Okay! Let's have
din-din with Mommy!

265
00:16:40.526 --> 00:16:42.676
Let go of me!

266
00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:00.701
What's going on?!

267
00:17:00.701 --> 00:17:03.091
Oh, are you awake, Shin-chan?

268
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:04.981
M-Mom!

269
00:17:04.981 --> 00:17:08.811
I also came back to Japan to
take care of something out here.

270
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:10.401
Take care of what?!

271
00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:11.861
Hey!

272
00:17:18.151 --> 00:17:19.581
Yuki-chan!

273
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.601
Yabuuchi Hiromi (37) Yukiko's old classmate
You came! Thank you!

274
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:23.331
I know you must be busy!
Yabuuchi Hiromi (37) Yukiko's old classmate

275
00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:26.441
I'd rush here from
the other side of the world

276
00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:28.981
to help my childhood friend, Hiromi!

277
00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:31.521
Oh? Where are Yusaku-san
and Shinichi-kun?

278
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:38.101
Oh, those two are busy.
But don't worry! I brought him instead!

279
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:39.891
Eh? Don't tell me he's...

280
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:44.151
Yep! My second son, Conan!
I had him in Los Angeles!

281
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:45.151
Hey, now!

282
00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:47.481
He's a kid, but he's quite sharp!

283
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:51.651
Oh! You and your husband
must be getting along well!

284
00:17:51.651 --> 00:17:52.491
Yeah, I guess!

285
00:17:55.151 --> 00:17:59.191
So, what is it you
want us to look into?

286
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.831
The truth is--

287
00:18:01.191 --> 00:18:04.101
Oh? Guests, Hiromi-san?

288
00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:05.751
Uncle Yoshifusa!

289
00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:10.401
This is Yukiko-san! She used to
visit all the time when she was little!

290
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:12.191
It's good to see you again!

291
00:18:13.421 --> 00:18:13.841
Hmm, I don't remember her.

292
00:18:13.841 --> 00:18:16.521
Yabuuchi Yoshifusa (64) Hiromi's uncle
Hmm, I don't remember her.

293
00:18:16.521 --> 00:18:17.931
But I did live in Brazil for a long time.
Yabuuchi Yoshifusa (64) Hiromi's uncle

294
00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.141
But I did live in Brazil for a long time.

295
00:18:21.521 --> 00:18:24.061
Make yourselves at home.

296
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.371
Alright! Let's go, Carlos!

297
00:18:26.561 --> 00:18:29.481
Carlos (26) Yabuuchi Yoshifusa's friend

298
00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:31.481
C-Carlos?

299
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:36.351
Uncle Yoshifusa says he's a
friend he brought back from Brazil...

300
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.491
Oh?

301
00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:41.651
Tell me. How does
Uncle Yoshifusa seem to you?

302
00:18:41.651 --> 00:18:42.481
What do you mean?

303
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:45.001
Like his face, voice, and feel...

304
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:50.231
Hmm. We used to play with him a lot,

305
00:18:50.231 --> 00:18:53.761
but he went to Brazil
before I entered grade school, so...

306
00:18:53.981 --> 00:18:57.691
Was it Uncle Yoshifusa
who you wanted us to investigate?!

307
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:01.521
Yes. He returned
from Brazil three days ago,

308
00:19:01.521 --> 00:19:05.601
but he seems different from before...

309
00:19:05.601 --> 00:19:11.941
Why not show him to your dad?
He's your dad's little brother, right?

310
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:13.731
I can't.

311
00:19:14.441 --> 00:19:19.281
My father, Yoshichika,
died last month of cancer...

312
00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:21.101
C-Cancer?

313
00:19:21.101 --> 00:19:24.351
Yes. My mother passed
away fifteen years ago,

314
00:19:24.351 --> 00:19:28.671
and all of Uncle Yoshifusa's
friends died early on...

315
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:34.691
So, we're the only two who've
met him on numerous occasions.

316
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:37.811
But, why are you
so suspicious of him?

317
00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:39.311
The inheritance.

318
00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.721
Dear!

319
00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:42.771
Hiromi's husband (married into family)
Everyone suspects

320
00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:47.021
that old man might be an impostor
Hiromi's husband (married into family)

321
00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:48.691
trying to take her father's inheritance.
Hiromi's husband (married into family)

322
00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:54.561
He owned all the land in this area,
and his inheritance is worth a lot.

323
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:58.701
The lawyer says he left a will,

324
00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:06.701
and that anyone who's absent when
it's read doesn't get a single yen.

325
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:10.811
When is it going to be read?

326
00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:13.711
Tomorrow night at 10:00,
when his mourning ends.

327
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:15.271
Yabuuchi Yoshiyuki (32) Hiromi's brother
Which means we gotta unmask

328
00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:17.971
that old man before then.
Yabuuchi Yoshiyuki (32) Hiromi's brother

329
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:18.021
that old man before then.

330
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:21.721
Or else we'll end up with a smaller share.
Yabuuchi Keiko (28) Yoshiyuki's wife

331
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:25.601
Yabuuchi Machiko (39) Yoshichika's 2nd wife
lt might not just mean a smaller share.

332
00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:29.391
Depending on the contents of
the will, we may get nothing.
Yabuuchi Machiko (39) Yoshichika's 2nd wife

333
00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:33.151
Anyways, we gotta do something
before tomorrow night.

334
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:36.651
Where did all these people come from?

335
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:40.111
Geez!

336
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:44.311
Aren't there any old photos left?

337
00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:49.911
It seems Uncle Yoshifusa took
them all when he went to Brazil.

338
00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:56.601
Oh, could this be him?

339
00:20:56.601 --> 00:20:59.311
See? You guys are in it too, Mom.

340
00:20:59.311 --> 00:21:00.721
Eh?

341
00:21:01.101 --> 00:21:04.601
Oh, that's him!
The one in the middle!

342
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.721
It's definitely Uncle Yoshifusa!

343
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:10.561
But, he's too young
in it to be of any use.

344
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.731
Plus, he has a hat on.

345
00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:15.231
But this brings back memories!

346
00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:18.071
This is from the city
baseball tournament!

347
00:21:18.771 --> 00:21:24.481
Do you remember?
A runner's shoe spike injured his leg.

348
00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:28.081
That's right. He had to get
lots of stitches at the hospital.

349
00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:32.061
Then, shouldn't
he still have that scar?

350
00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:32.831
Eh?

351
00:21:34.371 --> 00:21:36.651
Hiromi! Good luck!

352
00:21:36.651 --> 00:21:37.381
Yeah...

353
00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:41.481
Uncle! Would you like some tea?

354
00:21:41.481 --> 00:21:42.761
Oh, thank you.

355
00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:45.281
Ouch!

356
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.101
I'm sorry! I'll clean it up...

357
00:21:48.151 --> 00:21:49.181
It's not there!

358
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:50.941
The scar isn't there!

359
00:21:50.941 --> 00:21:51.801
What?!

360
00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:53.141
Scar?

361
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:56.651
Oh, do you mean this?

362
00:21:59.071 --> 00:22:03.771
A runner spiked my
leg hard on first base

363
00:22:03.771 --> 00:22:07.571
during a baseball game thirty years ago.

364
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:10.981
Huh? He does have a scar...

365
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:12.581
Meaning it's really him?

366
00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:16.271
So, you did suspect me!

367
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:20.061
My brother was right!
There are no decent people here!

368
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:22.591
I was wise to bring Carlos with me!

369
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.591
Wise?

370
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:27.341
He's a bodyguard I hired in Brazil.

371
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:29.601
B-Bodyguard?!

372
00:22:30.151 --> 00:22:32.191
Why would you need one?

373
00:22:32.191 --> 00:22:38.021
You'd hire one too,
if you got a letter like this!

374
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:39.811
"There's no inheritance for you.

375
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:42.111
If you value your life,
don't come back."

376
00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:43.691
L-Life?!

377
00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:01.889
When did you get this letter?!

378
00:23:01.889 --> 00:23:01.892
When did you get this letter?!
One month ago. It was
sent to my house in Brazil.

379
00:23:01.892 --> 00:23:06.669
One month ago. It was
sent to my house in Brazil.

380
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:09.979
It goes without saying that
the sender's name was missing.

381
00:23:11.209 --> 00:23:15.979
I didn't care about my brother's
inheritance, but I did want to see

382
00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:20.989
the faces of the buffoons
who would send such a letter.

383
00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:22.989
Buffoons?

384
00:23:23.249 --> 00:23:26.669
Now, if you're finished here,
then get the hell out!

385
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:28.999
Hey, mister!
Teach me some kanji letters!

386
00:23:30.129 --> 00:23:32.999
Mom won't help me.

387
00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:33.829
Hold on, Shin--

388
00:23:34.499 --> 00:23:36.499
I mean, Conan-chan!

389
00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:39.199
How do you write "happy new year"?

390
00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.639
L-Left-handed?!

391
00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:48.459
Did you see that, Sis?!

392
00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:52.919
Yes. But I can't remember
if our uncle was left-handed or not.

393
00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:54.649
Do you remember, Yuki-chan?

394
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:56.339
Not at all.

395
00:23:56.339 --> 00:24:02.909
But, he did have the scar on his leg,
so I think he is Uncle Yoshifusa.

396
00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:05.799
No, he could've heard from someone

397
00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:10.919
and relied on an old scar of
his own he just happened to have.

398
00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:13.219
Then that geezer is a fake?!

399
00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:15.749
I think he's the real deal.

400
00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:20.419
Take a look at the photo of
Uncle Yoshifusa we found in the shed.

401
00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:25.929
See? He has a mitt on his right hand.
Proof that he's left-handed.

402
00:24:26.629 --> 00:24:27.709
That's true...

403
00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:30.019
Plus, his handwriting is the same.

404
00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:30.719
Handwriting?

405
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:34.299
Happy New Year
I found this postcard with the photograph!

406
00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:39.169
A New Year's card that Uncle
Yoshifusa sent when he was in Brazil!
Happy New Year

407
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:42.569
See? The handwriting matches
exactly with what he wrote just now!
Happy New Year

408
00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:47.839
Hold on. Don't tell me you had
him write this so you could check?

409
00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:50.589
Just what I'd expect
from the son of Kudo Yusaku,

410
00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.649
the world-renowned mystery writer!

411
00:24:54.249 --> 00:24:58.669
He's my son! Mine!

412
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:59.709
Okay...

413
00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:03.129
Oh?

414
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.559
The old well is still here?

415
00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:09.669
Even after that accident...

416
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:10.669
Yeah...

417
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:12.219
Accident?

418
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:14.549
Our mother fell into it and died.

419
00:25:16.089 --> 00:25:21.589
She disappeared one day fifteen
years ago, after a very heavy snowfall.

420
00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:23.999
We all looked for her,
but couldn't find her.

421
00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:26.999
The next morning, just when
we were about to contact the police,

422
00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:30.779
we found her in the well, dead.

423
00:25:31.709 --> 00:25:34.419
We were going to destroy
the well because it was dangerous,

424
00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:40.799
but Father asked to keep it until he
died too, so he'd never forget her.

425
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:44.999
So, that's why there's
a fence around the well.

426
00:25:44.999 --> 00:25:49.759
I went and put it there myself,
so nobody else'd fall in.

427
00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:54.209
But, the real trouble was
during the funeral before then.

428
00:25:54.209 --> 00:25:55.269
Funeral?

429
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:58.839
Our mom's brother
suddenly caused a scene!

430
00:25:58.839 --> 00:26:02.819
Claimed one of us
knocked her down there!

431
00:26:02.819 --> 00:26:04.739
What really did happen?

432
00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:09.459
The cause was that
camellia plant our uncle grew

433
00:26:09.459 --> 00:26:12.739
as a wedding gift for our parents.

434
00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:14.499
Camellia?

435
00:26:14.499 --> 00:26:17.089
The sasanqua next to the well.

436
00:26:17.089 --> 00:26:22.499
Our mother stood on the edge of
the well to pick a flower, but slipped.

437
00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:28.209
She wanted to show it to us.
She loved those flowers.

438
00:26:28.209 --> 00:26:32.169
They hardly bloomed
during the winter of that year,

439
00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:36.299
and she had been
waiting for them eagerly.

440
00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:40.549
A camellia flower
was found in her hand, so...

441
00:26:42.459 --> 00:26:48.239
But, in the end, her brother
didn't seem to accept it.

442
00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:51.199
Hey! Where is he now?!

443
00:26:51.199 --> 00:26:52.299
I don't know.

444
00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:57.299
He was rather old back then,
so perhaps he's passed away?

445
00:26:57.299 --> 00:27:01.779
Hey, now! If he's still alive,
won't he get the inheritance, too?!

446
00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:05.839
Don't worry! Legally, he shouldn't
have any inheritance rights to it!

447
00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:08.009
That's not necessarily true.

448
00:27:08.249 --> 00:27:14.509
He could still receive some inheritance,
if it's in my husband's will.

449
00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:19.749
Then, what, he might show
up before 10:00 tomorrow night,

450
00:27:19.749 --> 00:27:21.709
when the will is read?!

451
00:27:21.709 --> 00:27:22.689
Eh?!

452
00:27:23.129 --> 00:27:28.249
That's right. If he's alive,
he'll be absolutely sure to come.

453
00:27:28.249 --> 00:27:32.949
Plus, he seems to have a
15-year old grudge with you all.

454
00:27:32.949 --> 00:27:37.379
Though, it has nothing
to do with me, of course,

455
00:27:37.379 --> 00:27:41.459
as I wasn't a part
of this family when she died.

456
00:27:42.379 --> 00:27:47.089
Oh, yes! I'm off to a friend's
after-wedding party now.

457
00:27:47.089 --> 00:27:50.799
I leave the rest to you,
Hiromi-san!

458
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.549
Yes, Mother.

459
00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:55.799
W-Who's there?!

460
00:27:57.959 --> 00:27:59.169
What's going on?

461
00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:01.519
Someone was just there!

462
00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:06.019
A strange person watching
us from behind that wood gate!

463
00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:10.839
I don't see anyone!

464
00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:13.279
Sure you weren't
just seeing things, kid?

465
00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:17.989
That's strange. I'm pretty
sure someone was here...

466
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:24.869
I don't like this. Don't tell me
this person is actually her brother?!

467
00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:31.919
I'm sorry to bother you by staying here
and having you make such a nice meal!

468
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:36.009
It's no problem! Nabe dishes
are more fun with lots of people!

469
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:40.049
Whatever. You even
packed a change of clothes.

470
00:28:40.049 --> 00:28:43.139
I bet you were planning
to stay from the start...

471
00:28:43.749 --> 00:28:47.339
What was that? Did you
say something, Conan-chan?

472
00:28:47.339 --> 00:28:49.109
No, nothing...

473
00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:52.989
Who could that be at this hour?

474
00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:55.339
Hello?

475
00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:56.669
Oh, Hiromi-san?

476
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:59.839
Oh, Mother! What's going on?

477
00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:02.999
That reminds me, we were
out of firewood for the bath.

478
00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:06.379
Yes. So I thought we'd go
without using the bath tonight.

479
00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:08.919
Mother?!

480
00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:13.169
Machiko-chan! Let's drink!

481
00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:16.679
Quit it! I'm on the phone!

482
00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:17.999
Oh, yes!

483
00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:22.339
I bought firewood for the bath
this morning and put it by the shed.

484
00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:22.999
Right.

485
00:29:22.999 --> 00:29:25.479
Well, see you later!

486
00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:28.749
Mother seems to be quite drunk.

487
00:29:28.749 --> 00:29:31.879
She sure is carefree in
the middle of Dad's mourning.

488
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:38.489
Oh! A nabe for dinner tonight!
Now I can rest easy!

489
00:29:38.489 --> 00:29:39.799
Rest easy?

490
00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:44.589
I won't have to ask Carlos
to taste-test my food for poison!

491
00:29:44.589 --> 00:29:46.219
Uncle!

492
00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:50.419
I'm sure that letter
was a prank or something!

493
00:29:50.419 --> 00:29:51.999
Let's hope so.

494
00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:58.249
How's the water, Yuki-chan?

495
00:29:58.249 --> 00:30:00.509
It seems just right!

496
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:03.959
Still, a caldron bath in these times?

497
00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:06.519
Oh, what's wrong
with that? It has elegance.

498
00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:11.379
Say, Shin-chan. Want to bathe
together like in the old days?

499
00:30:11.379 --> 00:30:12.439
Forget it.

500
00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:16.449
Hey. Could you tell
Uncle the bath is ready?

501
00:30:16.449 --> 00:30:19.499
Come to think of it, he did love baths!

502
00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:21.449
He always took the first bath, too!

503
00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:26.589
Do you think he and that Carlos
person will fit in this small bath?

504
00:30:26.589 --> 00:30:28.089
You're so silly!

505
00:30:28.089 --> 00:30:30.999
Uncle has taken a bath
every day since he's come here,

506
00:30:30.999 --> 00:30:33.249
but Carlos always stayed in the house.

507
00:30:33.249 --> 00:30:37.169
Eh? He would take a bath all alone,
leaving his bodyguard behind?

508
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:45.269
Now I see. Carlos watches
everyone while he's in the bath...

509
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:48.219
Alright. I'm counting on you, Carlos.

510
00:30:52.999 --> 00:30:55.669
Hello? Mother?

511
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:58.109
Well? Did you find the firewood?

512
00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:01.379
Yes! Uncle just went to take a bath!

513
00:31:01.379 --> 00:31:02.799
Oh, really?

514
00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:07.419
I'm still at the party. I don't think
I'll be back until after 11:00.

515
00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:10.999
I'm sorry to ask, but could
you keep the bath warm until then?

516
00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:12.629
Sure!

517
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:19.799
That was a great bath!

518
00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:22.089
Think I'll go next.

519
00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:24.389
Guess I'll go after you, then.

520
00:31:28.129 --> 00:31:30.339
Oh! How was the water?

521
00:31:30.339 --> 00:31:32.999
It was a little cold, I guess.

522
00:31:32.999 --> 00:31:35.729
I better rebuild the fire then.

523
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:36.399
Yeah.

524
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:37.929
Thanks for the hard work!

525
00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:39.209
Make yourself at home!

526
00:31:43.409 --> 00:31:47.879
Honestly! You can take baths
with Ran-chan, but not with me?!

527
00:31:54.249 --> 00:31:55.839
What is it, Hiromi?!

528
00:31:55.839 --> 00:32:00.629
J-Just now! There was a weird man
with sunglasses behind the gate!

529
00:32:01.209 --> 00:32:03.839
So, I did see that guy!

530
00:32:06.969 --> 00:32:09.669
Hey! Doesn't that pail seem strange?!

531
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:10.229
Eh?!

532
00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:12.879
See?! The well bucket is up!

533
00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:18.129
It looks like something's stuck to it!

534
00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:19.229
Let's pull it up!

535
00:32:20.589 --> 00:32:22.239
It's pretty heavy!

536
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:27.879
Heave-ho!

537
00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:39.879
M-Mother!

538
00:32:43.009 --> 00:32:45.249
H-How did this happen?!

539
00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:48.009
D-Don't tell me she jumped
into the well to commit suicide?!

540
00:32:50.089 --> 00:32:54.729
No! There's a stab mark in
her chest! This is how she died!

541
00:32:54.729 --> 00:32:56.479
W-What?!

542
00:32:56.479 --> 00:32:59.609
Does that mean someone here did it?!

543
00:32:59.609 --> 00:33:01.359
Y-You can't be serious!

544
00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:06.379
Say. Machiko-san's last phone
call was at around 9:00, right?

545
00:33:06.379 --> 00:33:10.049
Yes. From the banquet hall
of the hotel near the station.

546
00:33:10.049 --> 00:33:12.909
I went into the bath ten minutes ago.

547
00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:18.049
Did anyone leave the
room while I was in the bath?

548
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:19.879
No. No one.

549
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:24.089
Then, it couldn't
have been someone here.

550
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:28.339
It would take at least one hour by
car from the hotel to this house.

551
00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.379
In other words, while I was in the bath,

552
00:33:30.379 --> 00:33:35.189
she returned, and someone killed
her and threw her down the well.

553
00:33:35.959 --> 00:33:38.709
Though, it's a different
story if you suspect me,

554
00:33:38.709 --> 00:33:41.049
even though I met her
for the first time today.

555
00:33:41.049 --> 00:33:43.589
Then who did kill her?!

556
00:33:43.589 --> 00:33:46.919
Could it be the suspicious man
with sunglasses you just saw?!

557
00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:49.739
But why would he kill Mother?!

558
00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:53.949
There's something in her pocket!

559
00:33:53.949 --> 00:33:55.249
What?!

560
00:33:55.249 --> 00:33:57.249
T-This is...

561
00:33:57.249 --> 00:33:58.669
...a camellia flower!

562
00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:03.669
Then... Then the person
I just saw r-really was...

563
00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:07.839
The man from fifteen years ago...
