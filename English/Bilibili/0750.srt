1
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.940
Fantastic!

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.040
So many yachts!

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.740
I wonder how far you can go on those?

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.740
Well, you can even go to countries abroad

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040
because the seas are connected.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.740
I'd like to sail on one of those.

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.140
Me too.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.340
More than that...

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.340
I'm kind of hungry so let's hurry back

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.240
and eat our lunch boxes.

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.840
So you're more into eating

12
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.940
than the spirit of adventure, aren't you, Genta?

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240
It looks really delicious!

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.740
Hey, which one...

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.240
This is the place.

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.940
Mr. Takiguchi!

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.540
Shirakabe Hotel delivery service.

18
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.240
Your order is ready!

19
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.740
It's from a hotel!

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.540
No wonder it looks so good.

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.240
Hey, no matter how much you stare,

22
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.940
there's nothing for you guys.

23
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.040
Go away.

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.240
There's no need to be so mean.

25
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.240
"Nao Takiguchi (34)" -Thank you.

26
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.840
"President's Wife" -That was fast.

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.540
What a cute puppy!

28
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.940
His name's Coro.

29
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.740
What a pretty necklace!

30
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.940
Thank you.

31
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.740
But this is acrylic and cheap.

32
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.940
Where shall I put the food, Miss?

33
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.140
I'm sorry. Would you please bring them on board the cruiser.

34
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.140
Why don't you all come too?

35
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
-But... -You're a total stranger to us...

36
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.940
The food of this hotel is delicious.

37
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.640
You'll come and eat, won't you?

38
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940
But, if we eat,

39
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.240
you won't have enough for yourselves.

40
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.440
Children shouldn't be so hesitant.

41
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.140
"Kotaro Takiguchi, Company president" -I ordered enough food to last us

42
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.640
till dinner so there's more food than we can possibly eat!

43
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.840
You mean it's really okay for us to eat with you?

44
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.540
Sure, I was just thinking that we could use some company.

45
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.740
You're more than welcome to join us.

46
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.040
-Well, then, thank you! -Thank you!

47
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.740
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

48
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.540
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

49
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.240
We are all eye-witnesses.

50
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.140
The tycoon who dived into the sea.

51
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.840
His name is Detective Conan!

54
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.070
"The Man Betrayed by the Sea"

55
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.370
I wonder where they went off to?

56
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.570
It's because you were sleeping right through

57
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.970
despite coming to the beach.

58
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.170
Let's look for them a little more

59
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.170
and if we can't find them let's eat up their lunch boxes.

60
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.670
They curse you for it, if you do that.

61
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.270
Like they say, a grudge over food is scary, you know.

62
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.570
I guess so.

63
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.270
It's too bad that Conan and Ai

64
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.670
aren't getting to eat food as delicious as this!

65
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.670
That's not our problem!

66
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.970
Serves him right for coming to the beach and sleeping!

67
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.170
Do you have other friends here with you?

68
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.670
Yes. We're really good friends.

69
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.170
But, Ai said that she didn't want to get a sun tan.

70
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.870
Worrying about her skin at such a young age,

71
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.170
I'd sure like to see

72
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.070
what sort of beauty she'd turn out to be in the future.

73
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.470
Conan, despite being in elementary school

74
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.970
reads detective novels till early morning

75
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.270
and isn't very child like.

76
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.970
He's not cute.

77
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.370
Sorry I'm not cute.

78
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.670
Conan!

79
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.270
Then, you're Ai cutie-pie?

80
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.270
Yes, although I'm sorry I haven't turned into a beauty yet.

81
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.470
You're already quite a beauty...

82
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.970
for a grade schooler. Right?

83
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.870
What brings you two here?

84
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.070
That's for us to say, isn't it?

85
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.670
We came to look for you

86
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.670
because it's about time to eat lunch!

87
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.070
I feel bad for your mothers who made your lunch boxes,

88
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.070
but why not eat them on your way back or something.

89
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.870
Come here both of you and eat with us.

90
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.070
Do that.

91
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.370
This roast beef is delicious!

92
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.870
This lobster is superb too!

93
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.370
Mitsuhiko, you're eating too much lobster!

94
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.470
This is spiny lobster.

95
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.170
Are they different?

96
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.070
Dear.

97
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.670
The children will laugh at you.

98
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.270
You look like honeymooners.

99
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.270
Yeah, we just got married 6 months ago.

100
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.470
But this is my first marriage, you know.

101
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.770
I was so busy trying to enlarge my company

102
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.970
that I had forgotten about getting married.

103
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.870
How nice.

104
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.370
How nice it would be to go off shore in this cruiser

105
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.970
and swim in this beautiful sea.

106
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.770
Impossible, you can't swim that much yet, can you, Ayumi?

107
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.470
If I owned a cruiser like this

108
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.370
I'd be able to swim right away.

109
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.470
That's the way to go, Ayumi.

110
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.270
No need to worry yourself over it.

111
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.070
I couldn't swim till this age either,

112
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.470
but I trained hard nd can swim now.

113
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.370
Like they say, where there's a will, there's a way.

114
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.070
You went to a sports club, right?

115
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.970
No, since I rebuilt my house,

116
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.870
I made a pool too.

117
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.870
I'll show you something good.

118
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.770
I didn't know you took that kind of picture.

119
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.970
Cut it out already. It's embarrassing.

120
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.770
But, in the end...

121
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.770
See!

122
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.370
True.

123
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.970
You can swim!

124
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.170
Okay!

125
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.670
Let's race and see who'll get to the beached bank first!

126
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.570
Ayumi, you can go ahead and use a float.

127
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.070
Okay, let's do it!

128
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.370
No!

129
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.770
You just drank wine.

130
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.070
Moreover, you've got high blood pressure

131
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.170
so rest a while before doing so.

132
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.770
Heck, I was so sure I could win.

133
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.370
How old is Coro?

134
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.770
He just turned one year old.

135
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.070
The metal on his collar is rusted.

136
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.770
I wonder if it's because we take him for walks even on rainy days.

137
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.970
We should be heading back soon.

138
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.670
I forgot.

139
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.470
How could you have a feast without me?

140
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.170
Isn't it only natural that someone comes to tell me about it?

141
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.270
I was so worried that I was just about to call the police.

142
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.170
You'll have indigestion if you eat while angry.

143
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.570
Here goes!

144
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.070
Here goes!

145
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.570
Nice shot!

146
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.970
Here.

147
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:49.870
Isn't that Nao and Kotaro's cruiser that's sailing out over there?

148
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.770
You're right.

149
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.570
Yes, Nao's come out too.

150
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.370
I wonder if he's planning to swim?

151
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.470
Kotaro! Thank you for everything!

152
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.970
Let's swim too.

153
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.970
I guess so.

154
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.370
-I'll go get the float then. -What's this? It feels different!

155
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.970
Somebody... Somebody!

156
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.870
Oh no! He's drowning!

157
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.870
Dear!

158
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.570
"Tokyo Fire Department"

159
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.470
I hope he's okay.

160
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.470
I don't feel like having fun anymore.

161
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.470
True.

162
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.270
Although it's still early, let's call it a day today.

163
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.470
Let's call the fire department about Mr. Taguchi later

164
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.570
and find out how he's doing.

165
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.770
You're the children

166
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.970
that were with the Takiguchi's a while ago, aren't you?

167
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.270
I went to get the dishes,

168
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.470
but there was nobody on the cruiser.

169
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.870
Do you know anything?

170
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.270
Then let us get the dishes for you.

171
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.270
I see, they didn't let you ride the ambulance?

172
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.970
Maybe we should take Nao and Kotaro's clothes over to them, no?

173
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.970
Yeah, I guess so.

174
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.870
Is this really an accident?

175
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.970
Although detailed investigation is yet to come,

176
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.470
according to eye-witness reports,

177
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.270
there's no mistake that he dived in himself.

178
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.070
"Ryoichi Katagiri (48), Takiguchi's secretary" -Unbelievable.

179
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.470
Any possibility that someone pushed him over?

180
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.170
"Detective Ishiyama" -Only he and his wife were on board the cruiser.

181
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.970
Are you saying that his wife pushed him over?

182
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.770
Not really.

183
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.770
The president used to say,

184
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.570
that when he was a child, he almost drowned in the river.

185
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.770
So since then he'd been afraid of water and unable to swim.

186
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.370
He went trained hard recently

187
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.470
and learned now to swim!

188
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.270
And you are?

189
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.170
Excuse us.

190
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.970
The children happen to become acquainted with the Takiguchi's.

191
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.870
And since they said the Takiguchi's treated them very cordially

192
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.570
we came over to see them.

193
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.570
We brought their clothes over too.

194
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.870
Coro was left behind too.

195
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.670
How is Mr. Takiguchi?

196
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.370
Well, I hate to say this but...

197
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.170
We confirmed his death a while ago.

198
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.670
No.

199
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.670
How could someone so nice pass away?

200
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.570
I don't believe it.

201
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.870
At any rate, detective,

202
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.970
please check carefully whether it was really an accident or not.

203
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.670
We've been repeatedly telling the president from before he got married

204
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.870
that his wife was only after his estate.

205
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.470
But, he completely fell for her and was deceived by that woman

206
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.370
and ended up this way.

207
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.070
Are you saying that Nao's to blame?

208
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.470
Somebody so nice would never do something so evil!

209
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.470
Hey, hey...

210
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.170
I'm very sorry.

211
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.370
Are you from Mr. Takiguchi's company?

212
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.770
Yes. I'm his chief secretary, Katagiri.

213
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.070
Did you children see the accident?

214
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.470
Yeah, we did.

215
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.370
Mr. Takiguchi drowned right before our eyes.

216
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.970
Mr. Takiguchi waved at us

217
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.570
and then dived into the sea.

218
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.670
I see.

219
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.370
Then, will you come to the station with me

220
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.570
and tell me about what happened back then?

221
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.270
-Yes... -Yes, sir.

222
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.454
When Mr. Takiguchi dove in

223
00:13:02.454 --> 00:13:04.954
do you know where Mrs. Takiguchi was?

224
00:13:04.954 --> 00:13:08.454
She was doing something some distance away.

225
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:12.054
Maybe she was putting away the dishes after lunch.

226
00:13:12.054 --> 00:13:17.554
I see. That's why she didn't realize right away that he was drowning.

227
00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:18.554
Come in.

228
00:13:23.654 --> 00:13:24.654
Nao.

229
00:13:27.254 --> 00:13:28.354
Ayumi.

230
00:13:28.354 --> 00:13:30.954
Thank you for bringing our clothes.

231
00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:36.054
Nao. Your necklace...

232
00:13:36.054 --> 00:13:38.354
I'm sure that the chain broke

233
00:13:38.354 --> 00:13:39.454
and sank into the sea

234
00:13:39.454 --> 00:13:41.154
when I dove in to save him.

235
00:13:43.554 --> 00:13:46.354
I heard what these children had to say,

236
00:13:46.354 --> 00:13:48.654
and it seems that your husband had in fact,

237
00:13:48.654 --> 00:13:50.754
dove into the sea on his own.

238
00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:52.454
So, there's probably no mistake

239
00:13:52.454 --> 00:13:55.054
that this was just an unfortunate accident.

240
00:13:55.054 --> 00:13:57.154
I'm to blame.

241
00:13:57.154 --> 00:13:59.454
He may have learned how to swim,

242
00:13:59.454 --> 00:14:02.754
but I shouldn't have taken my eyes off him.

243
00:14:02.754 --> 00:14:06.754
That was the one other thing I wanted to ask you about.

244
00:14:06.754 --> 00:14:10.754
I hear that Mr. Taguchi told his colleagues that he couldn't swim,

245
00:14:10.754 --> 00:14:14.754
but did he really master how to swim?

246
00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:19.854
Yes. Show him the practice video.

247
00:14:19.854 --> 00:14:21.854
That's right.

248
00:14:21.854 --> 00:14:26.554
This is the image of him when he first practiced swimming in the pool.

249
00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:28.654
-You're doing good! -My pictures in the pool

250
00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:31.854
-Keep it up! You're doing good! -were taken by the housekeeper.

251
00:14:33.154 --> 00:14:36.354
And this is what was taken last week.

252
00:14:40.154 --> 00:14:42.154
You're doing good, keep it up!

253
00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:44.354
Don't stop and turn!

254
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:47.954
I see.

255
00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:50.954
It's true that he could swim.

256
00:14:52.654 --> 00:14:54.054
Come here, will you.

257
00:14:56.254 --> 00:14:57.754
What is it, Conan?

258
00:14:57.754 --> 00:14:59.954
Show me the video camera.

259
00:14:59.954 --> 00:15:01.554
Okay.

260
00:15:09.054 --> 00:15:13.454
Is there anything important shown here?

261
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:14.754
You're right.

262
00:15:14.754 --> 00:15:17.254
Yes. Nao's come out too.

263
00:15:18.254 --> 00:15:21.454
Okay, the voices are recorded too.

264
00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:23.154
The problem is after this...

265
00:15:24.854 --> 00:15:26.754
Let's swim too.

266
00:15:26.754 --> 00:15:27.754
I guess so.

267
00:15:27.754 --> 00:15:32.254
-I'll go get the float then. -What's this? It feels different!

268
00:15:32.254 --> 00:15:34.954
Somebody... Somebody!

269
00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:38.854
Over here.

270
00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:40.754
Can you zoom this up?

271
00:15:40.754 --> 00:15:43.154
Yes, although the picture would become grainy.

272
00:15:44.954 --> 00:15:47.354
Somebody... Somebody!

273
00:15:56.054 --> 00:15:57.154
Dear!

274
00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:01.654
What's going on?

275
00:16:01.654 --> 00:16:03.254
There's a slight time lapse from the time

276
00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.054
that Kotaro is about to drown

277
00:16:05.054 --> 00:16:08.254
to the time Nao jumps in to save him.

278
00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:12.954
Besides, that cruiser was equipped with a life saving float,

279
00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:15.654
and yet why didn't she use it?

280
00:16:15.654 --> 00:16:16.954
One more thing.

281
00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:21.354
What was that image that was taken during the swimming practice?

282
00:16:22.354 --> 00:16:24.354
Maybe Kotaro actually...

283
00:16:26.554 --> 00:16:29.354
What're you two doing in secret?

284
00:16:32.754 --> 00:16:36.054
The metal on its collar is rusted.

285
00:16:37.054 --> 00:16:39.554
I wonder if it's because we take him for walks even on rainy days.

286
00:16:40.554 --> 00:16:42.554
I get it.

287
00:16:46.954 --> 00:16:50.254
All right, I'm sorry to have taken up your time,

288
00:16:50.254 --> 00:16:52.454
but you may go now.

289
00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:55.454
I'll drive you to the hospital, Mrs. Takiguchi.

290
00:16:55.454 --> 00:16:56.854
Thank you all.

291
00:16:56.854 --> 00:16:59.854
Will you please wait.

292
00:16:59.854 --> 00:17:02.354
Is there something you'd like to say?

293
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.754
Oh, no.

294
00:17:04.754 --> 00:17:07.454
This not just a mere accident.

295
00:17:07.454 --> 00:17:09.954
It is a carefully schemed homicide.

296
00:17:09.954 --> 00:17:12.154
What? What was that?

297
00:17:12.154 --> 00:17:13.754
What?

298
00:17:13.754 --> 00:17:17.254
But, Mr. Takiguchi dove into the sea himself.

299
00:17:17.254 --> 00:17:21.654
Yes, but if he knew that the wouldn't be able to swim,

300
00:17:21.654 --> 00:17:25.454
he probably wouldn't have dove in of his own initiative.

301
00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:27.754
Mr. Takiguchi, although he couldn't swim

302
00:17:27.754 --> 00:17:29.854
was made to believe that he could

303
00:17:29.854 --> 00:17:31.454
and suddenly taken off shore

304
00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:34.954
where his feet couldn't touch the bottom.

305
00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:38.254
Wouldn't this be considered nothing but murder?

306
00:17:38.254 --> 00:17:41.154
Correct, Mrs. Nao Takiguchi?

307
00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:43.854
My husband could swim.

308
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:46.454
You saw for yourself too, didn't you?

309
00:17:46.454 --> 00:17:50.154
Are you saying that there was some trick involved in that image?

310
00:17:50.154 --> 00:17:53.654
No, that image is genuine.

311
00:17:53.654 --> 00:17:56.054
Mr. Takiguchi could swim.

312
00:17:56.054 --> 00:17:58.154
What on earth are you getting at?

313
00:17:58.154 --> 00:17:59.754
However...

314
00:17:59.754 --> 00:18:02.454
Only in the pool of his home.

315
00:18:02.454 --> 00:18:03.454
Conan!

316
00:18:03.454 --> 00:18:04.754
Yes!

317
00:18:05.854 --> 00:18:07.554
Please lend it to me.

318
00:18:07.554 --> 00:18:12.254
Please look at Nao's necklace here during his swimming practice.

319
00:18:13.254 --> 00:18:15.954
See. It's sunk underwater, isn't it?

320
00:18:15.954 --> 00:18:18.154
But, on the last day...

321
00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:20.154
See, it's floating on the water!

322
00:18:20.154 --> 00:18:21.254
What?

323
00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:22.554
Let me see.

324
00:18:26.654 --> 00:18:29.654
The necklace that was sunk is afloat.

325
00:18:29.654 --> 00:18:31.154
What is the meaning of this?

326
00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:33.454
Will you explain it in simple terms for me?

327
00:18:35.554 --> 00:18:37.854
Why is the necklace afloat?

328
00:18:37.854 --> 00:18:40.654
Coro pointed it out.

329
00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:43.054
The metal on the collar of Coro

330
00:18:43.054 --> 00:18:48.054
who is still on a year old is for some reason already rusted.

331
00:18:48.054 --> 00:18:52.754
Mrs. Takiguchi poured a large amount of bath salt into the pool.

332
00:18:52.754 --> 00:18:55.854
So that the body would float more easily.

333
00:18:55.854 --> 00:18:59.054
The necklace in the video was acrylic.

334
00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:04.354
The specific gravity of acrylics is 1.17 to 1.2,

335
00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:07.254
so the specific gravity of the pool water the other day,

336
00:19:07.254 --> 00:19:10.054
would've had to be heavier than that.

337
00:19:10.054 --> 00:19:13.154
Correct, Mrs. Takiguchi?

338
00:19:13.154 --> 00:19:16.154
No, if I put that much bath salt in the water,

339
00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:18.754
no matter how dense my husband is, he would've noticed.

340
00:19:18.754 --> 00:19:20.954
Then, what did you insert?

341
00:19:20.954 --> 00:19:22.754
The necklace that sank in the sea

342
00:19:22.754 --> 00:19:25.454
is afloat in the video image, you know?

343
00:19:25.454 --> 00:19:27.854
Either way, this video is proof

344
00:19:27.854 --> 00:19:32.054
that the specific gravity of the pool water is heavy.

345
00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:35.754
Shall we go over to your residence and check it out now?

346
00:19:35.754 --> 00:19:37.754
There's no water even if you did.

347
00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:40.954
The water of the pool has been drained.

348
00:19:40.954 --> 00:19:43.154
Don't take the police lightly.

349
00:19:43.154 --> 00:19:45.754
Just a minimum amount of residue in the pool

350
00:19:45.754 --> 00:19:49.454
is enough to determine what was dissolved there.

351
00:19:50.654 --> 00:19:54.854
Mrs. Takiguchi, is what he's saying true?

352
00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:56.154
How about it?

353
00:19:57.954 --> 00:20:00.354
Nao, it's not true, is it?

354
00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:05.054
It's true.

355
00:20:07.054 --> 00:20:09.154
It is... it's just as he said.

356
00:20:09.154 --> 00:20:12.054
At first I poured in bath salt but,

357
00:20:12.054 --> 00:20:16.554
when I increased the amount, he noticed it.

358
00:20:16.554 --> 00:20:19.854
From then I switched over to using water soluble polymer.

359
00:20:19.854 --> 00:20:23.954
To a non-toxic substance used in drugs and foodstuff.

360
00:20:23.954 --> 00:20:27.554
The specific gravity of the pool water last week

361
00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:30.054
would've probably been over 1.3.

362
00:20:31.054 --> 00:20:34.454
1.3 would mean that you could float on your back and read a book.

363
00:20:34.454 --> 00:20:37.254
It's the same as that of the Dead Sea.

364
00:20:37.254 --> 00:20:38.954
It's understandable that Mr. Takiguchi

365
00:20:38.954 --> 00:20:43.354
would be under the mistaken impression that he could swim.

366
00:20:43.354 --> 00:20:47.254
I guess you took the video as a safeguard

367
00:20:47.254 --> 00:20:49.954
in case you were interrogated by the police,

368
00:20:49.954 --> 00:20:53.854
but that video on the contrary gave you away.

369
00:20:56.054 --> 00:21:02.354
All that guy had in mind till now was to enlarge his company.

370
00:21:02.354 --> 00:21:03.854
If to pursue his purpose,

371
00:21:03.854 --> 00:21:07.654
he'd use whatever way he had to no matter how dirty.

372
00:21:07.654 --> 00:21:11.454
He probably had no idea how many people suffered because of him.

373
00:21:11.454 --> 00:21:16.454
So, I was thinking of making him suffer,

374
00:21:16.454 --> 00:21:20.454
but I just couldn't bear living with a guy with no common sense

375
00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:23.454
or sophistication any longer.

376
00:21:23.454 --> 00:21:27.954
I've had it.

377
00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:32.254
It may be true that Mr. Takiguchi was desperate trying to make money

378
00:21:32.254 --> 00:21:35.654
and didn't have any common sense nor sophistication

379
00:21:35.654 --> 00:21:38.954
but wasn't he more human than you,

380
00:21:38.954 --> 00:21:42.554
who took someone's life just for the sake of revenge?

381
00:23:11.154 --> 00:23:14.554
I was so sure that she was a nice person and yet...

382
00:23:14.554 --> 00:23:16.454
I thought that she was nice

383
00:23:16.454 --> 00:23:18.654
when we were eating over at her place.

384
00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:21.654
I don't trust adults anymore!

385
00:23:21.654 --> 00:23:24.154
There are all kinds of adults.

386
00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:26.154
-An array of them. -Exactly!

387
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.854
I still possess a pure heart!

388
00:23:29.854 --> 00:23:31.854
Did you say something?

389
00:23:31.854 --> 00:23:34.554
By the way, where's the left over lunch boxes?

390
00:23:34.554 --> 00:23:37.054
That's right. Thanks to the lunch we were invited to,

391
00:23:37.054 --> 00:23:38.754
we still have our lunch boxes!

392
00:23:38.754 --> 00:23:40.454
Let's hurry and eat it!

393
00:23:40.454 --> 00:23:43.154
Now that you mentioned it, I'm hungry.

394
00:23:43.154 --> 00:23:45.154
I wonder what the side dish for today is?

395
00:23:46.354 --> 00:23:51.254
Hey! I thought you guys were depressed.

396
00:23:51.254 --> 00:23:54.554
Oh, true! You're carrying Tai!

397
00:23:54.554 --> 00:23:58.254
This cat is my granddaughter's pet cat!

398
00:23:58.254 --> 00:24:01.854
These people came claiming that they are the owners.

399
00:24:01.854 --> 00:24:05.154
No, I'm the real owner.

400
00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:07.954
No, you're not! I'm telling you it's me, aren't I?

401
00:24:07.954 --> 00:24:10.754
He's not ordinary.

402
00:24:10.754 --> 00:24:13.754
Let's ask the master of solving mysteries to join us too.

403
00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:17.054
Next Conan,

404
00:24:17.054 --> 00:24:21.054
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 1)".

405
00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:39.554
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:39.554 --> 00:24:41.054
"Taii"
