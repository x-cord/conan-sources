1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,940
Fantastic!

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,040
So many yachts!

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,740
I wonder how far you can go on those?

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,740
Well, you can even go to countries abroad

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,040
because the seas are connected.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,740
I'd like to sail on one of those.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,140
Me too.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,340
More than that...

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
I'm kind of hungry so let's hurry back

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,240
and eat our lunch boxes.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
So you're more into eating

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,940
than the spirit of adventure, aren't you, Genta?

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,240
It looks really delicious!

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,740
Hey, which one...

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,240
This is the place.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,940
Mr. Takiguchi!

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,540
Shirakabe Hotel delivery service.

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,240
Your order is ready!

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,740
It's from a hotel!

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,540
No wonder it looks so good.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,240
Hey, no matter how much you stare,

22
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,940
there's nothing for you guys.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,040
Go away.

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,240
There's no need to be so mean.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,240
"Nao Takiguchi (34)" -Thank you.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,840
"President's Wife" -That was fast.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,540
What a cute puppy!

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,940
His name's Coro.

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,740
What a pretty necklace!

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,940
Thank you.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,740
But this is acrylic and cheap.

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,940
Where shall I put the food, Miss?

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,140
I'm sorry. Would you please bring them on board the cruiser.

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,140
Why don't you all come too?

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,140
-But... -You're a total stranger to us...

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,940
The food of this hotel is delicious.

37
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,640
You'll come and eat, won't you?

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,940
But, if we eat,

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,240
you won't have enough for yourselves.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Children shouldn't be so hesitant.

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,140
"Kotaro Takiguchi, Company president" -I ordered enough food to last us

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,640
till dinner so there's more food than we can possibly eat!

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,840
You mean it's really okay for us to eat with you?

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,540
Sure, I was just thinking that we could use some company.

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,740
You're more than welcome to join us.

46
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,040
-Well, then, thank you! -Thank you!

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,740
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

48
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,540
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,240
We are all eye-witnesses.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,140
The tycoon who dived into the sea.

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,840
His name is Detective Conan!

54
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,070
"The Man Betrayed by the Sea"

55
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,370
I wonder where they went off to?

56
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,570
It's because you were sleeping right through

57
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,970
despite coming to the beach.

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,170
Let's look for them a little more

59
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,170
and if we can't find them let's eat up their lunch boxes.

60
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,670
They curse you for it, if you do that.

61
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,270
Like they say, a grudge over food is scary, you know.

62
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,570
I guess so.

63
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,270
It's too bad that Conan and Ai

64
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,670
aren't getting to eat food as delicious as this!

65
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,670
That's not our problem!

66
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,970
Serves him right for coming to the beach and sleeping!

67
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,170
Do you have other friends here with you?

68
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,670
Yes. We're really good friends.

69
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,170
But, Ai said that she didn't want to get a sun tan.

70
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,870
Worrying about her skin at such a young age,

71
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,170
I'd sure like to see

72
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,070
what sort of beauty she'd turn out to be in the future.

73
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,470
Conan, despite being in elementary school

74
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,970
reads detective novels till early morning

75
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,270
and isn't very child like.

76
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,970
He's not cute.

77
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,370
Sorry I'm not cute.

78
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,670
Conan!

79
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,270
Then, you're Ai cutie-pie?

80
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,270
Yes, although I'm sorry I haven't turned into a beauty yet.

81
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,470
You're already quite a beauty...

82
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,970
for a grade schooler. Right?

83
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,870
What brings you two here?

84
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,070
That's for us to say, isn't it?

85
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,670
We came to look for you

86
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,670
because it's about time to eat lunch!

87
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,070
I feel bad for your mothers who made your lunch boxes,

88
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,070
but why not eat them on your way back or something.

89
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,870
Come here both of you and eat with us.

90
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,070
Do that.

91
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,370
This roast beef is delicious!

92
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,870
This lobster is superb too!

93
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,370
Mitsuhiko, you're eating too much lobster!

94
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,470
This is spiny lobster.

95
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,170
Are they different?

96
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,070
Dear.

97
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,670
The children will laugh at you.

98
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,270
You look like honeymooners.

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,270
Yeah, we just got married 6 months ago.

100
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,470
But this is my first marriage, you know.

101
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,770
I was so busy trying to enlarge my company

102
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,970
that I had forgotten about getting married.

103
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,870
How nice.

104
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,370
How nice it would be to go off shore in this cruiser

105
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,970
and swim in this beautiful sea.

106
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,770
Impossible, you can't swim that much yet, can you, Ayumi?

107
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,470
If I owned a cruiser like this

108
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,370
I'd be able to swim right away.

109
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,470
That's the way to go, Ayumi.

110
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,270
No need to worry yourself over it.

111
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,070
I couldn't swim till this age either,

112
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,470
but I trained hard nd can swim now.

113
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,370
Like they say, where there's a will, there's a way.

114
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,070
You went to a sports club, right?

115
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,970
No, since I rebuilt my house,

116
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,870
I made a pool too.

117
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,870
I'll show you something good.

118
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,770
I didn't know you took that kind of picture.

119
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,970
Cut it out already. It's embarrassing.

120
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,770
But, in the end...

121
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,770
See!

122
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,370
True.

123
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,970
You can swim!

124
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,170
Okay!

125
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,670
Let's race and see who'll get to the beached bank first!

126
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,570
Ayumi, you can go ahead and use a float.

127
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,070
Okay, let's do it!

128
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,370
No!

129
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,770
You just drank wine.

130
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,070
Moreover, you've got high blood pressure

131
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,170
so rest a while before doing so.

132
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,770
Heck, I was so sure I could win.

133
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,370
How old is Coro?

134
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,770
He just turned one year old.

135
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,070
The metal on his collar is rusted.

136
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,770
I wonder if it's because we take him for walks even on rainy days.

137
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,970
We should be heading back soon.

138
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,670
I forgot.

139
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,470
How could you have a feast without me?

140
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,170
Isn't it only natural that someone comes to tell me about it?

141
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,270
I was so worried that I was just about to call the police.

142
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,170
You'll have indigestion if you eat while angry.

143
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,570
Here goes!

144
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,070
Here goes!

145
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,570
Nice shot!

146
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,970
Here.

147
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,870
Isn't that Nao and Kotaro's cruiser that's sailing out over there?

148
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,770
You're right.

149
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,570
Yes, Nao's come out too.

150
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,370
I wonder if he's planning to swim?

151
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,470
Kotaro! Thank you for everything!

152
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,970
Let's swim too.

153
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,970
I guess so.

154
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,370
-I'll go get the float then. -What's this? It feels different!

155
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,970
Somebody... Somebody!

156
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,870
Oh no! He's drowning!

157
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,870
Dear!

158
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,570
"Tokyo Fire Department"

159
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,470
I hope he's okay.

160
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,470
I don't feel like having fun anymore.

161
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,470
True.

162
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,270
Although it's still early, let's call it a day today.

163
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,470
Let's call the fire department about Mr. Taguchi later

164
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,570
and find out how he's doing.

165
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,770
You're the children

166
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,970
that were with the Takiguchi's a while ago, aren't you?

167
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,270
I went to get the dishes,

168
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,470
but there was nobody on the cruiser.

169
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,870
Do you know anything?

170
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,270
Then let us get the dishes for you.

171
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,270
I see, they didn't let you ride the ambulance?

172
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,970
Maybe we should take Nao and Kotaro's clothes over to them, no?

173
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,970
Yeah, I guess so.

174
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,870
Is this really an accident?

175
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,970
Although detailed investigation is yet to come,

176
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,470
according to eye-witness reports,

177
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,270
there's no mistake that he dived in himself.

178
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,070
"Ryoichi Katagiri (48), Takiguchi's secretary" -Unbelievable.

179
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,470
Any possibility that someone pushed him over?

180
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,170
"Detective Ishiyama" -Only he and his wife were on board the cruiser.

181
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,970
Are you saying that his wife pushed him over?

182
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,770
Not really.

183
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,770
The president used to say,

184
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,570
that when he was a child, he almost drowned in the river.

185
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,770
So since then he'd been afraid of water and unable to swim.

186
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,370
He went trained hard recently

187
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,470
and learned now to swim!

188
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,270
And you are?

189
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,170
Excuse us.

190
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,970
The children happen to become acquainted with the Takiguchi's.

191
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,870
And since they said the Takiguchi's treated them very cordially

192
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,570
we came over to see them.

193
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,570
We brought their clothes over too.

194
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,870
Coro was left behind too.

195
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,670
How is Mr. Takiguchi?

196
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,370
Well, I hate to say this but...

197
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,170
We confirmed his death a while ago.

198
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,670
No.

199
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,670
How could someone so nice pass away?

200
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,570
I don't believe it.

201
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,870
At any rate, detective,

202
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,970
please check carefully whether it was really an accident or not.

203
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,670
We've been repeatedly telling the president from before he got married

204
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,870
that his wife was only after his estate.

205
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,470
But, he completely fell for her and was deceived by that woman

206
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,370
and ended up this way.

207
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,070
Are you saying that Nao's to blame?

208
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,470
Somebody so nice would never do something so evil!

209
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,470
Hey, hey...

210
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm very sorry.

211
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,370
Are you from Mr. Takiguchi's company?

212
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,770
Yes. I'm his chief secretary, Katagiri.

213
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,070
Did you children see the accident?

214
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,470
Yeah, we did.

215
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,370
Mr. Takiguchi drowned right before our eyes.

216
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,970
Mr. Takiguchi waved at us

217
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,570
and then dived into the sea.

218
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,670
I see.

219
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,370
Then, will you come to the station with me

220
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,570
and tell me about what happened back then?

221
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,270
-Yes... -Yes, sir.

222
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,454
When Mr. Takiguchi dove in

223
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:04,954
do you know where Mrs. Takiguchi was?

224
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:08,454
She was doing something some distance away.

225
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,054
Maybe she was putting away the dishes after lunch.

226
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:17,554
I see. That's why she didn't realize right away that he was drowning.

227
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:18,554
Come in.

228
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:24,654
Nao.

229
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,354
Ayumi.

230
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,954
Thank you for bringing our clothes.

231
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:36,054
Nao. Your necklace...

232
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:38,354
I'm sure that the chain broke

233
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,454
and sank into the sea

234
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,154
when I dove in to save him.

235
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:46,354
I heard what these children had to say,

236
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:48,654
and it seems that your husband had in fact,

237
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:50,754
dove into the sea on his own.

238
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:52,454
So, there's probably no mistake

239
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:55,054
that this was just an unfortunate accident.

240
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,154
I'm to blame.

241
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:59,454
He may have learned how to swim,

242
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:02,754
but I shouldn't have taken my eyes off him.

243
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:06,754
That was the one other thing I wanted to ask you about.

244
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:10,754
I hear that Mr. Taguchi told his colleagues that he couldn't swim,

245
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:14,754
but did he really master how to swim?

246
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:19,854
Yes. Show him the practice video.

247
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,854
That's right.

248
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:26,554
This is the image of him when he first practiced swimming in the pool.

249
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,654
-You're doing good! -My pictures in the pool

250
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,854
-Keep it up! You're doing good! -were taken by the housekeeper.

251
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:36,354
And this is what was taken last week.

252
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:42,154
You're doing good, keep it up!

253
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,354
Don't stop and turn!

254
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:47,954
I see.

255
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,954
It's true that he could swim.

256
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:54,054
Come here, will you.

257
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:57,754
What is it, Conan?

258
00:14:57,754 --> 00:14:59,954
Show me the video camera.

259
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:01,554
Okay.

260
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:13,454
Is there anything important shown here?

261
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,754
You're right.

262
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,254
Yes. Nao's come out too.

263
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:21,454
Okay, the voices are recorded too.

264
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,154
The problem is after this...

265
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,754
Let's swim too.

266
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:27,754
I guess so.

267
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:32,254
-I'll go get the float then. -What's this? It feels different!

268
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,954
Somebody... Somebody!

269
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:38,854
Over here.

270
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,754
Can you zoom this up?

271
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:43,154
Yes, although the picture would become grainy.

272
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:47,354
Somebody... Somebody!

273
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,154
Dear!

274
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:01,654
What's going on?

275
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,254
There's a slight time lapse from the time

276
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,054
that Kotaro is about to drown

277
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:08,254
to the time Nao jumps in to save him.

278
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:12,954
Besides, that cruiser was equipped with a life saving float,

279
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:15,654
and yet why didn't she use it?

280
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:16,954
One more thing.

281
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:21,354
What was that image that was taken during the swimming practice?

282
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:24,354
Maybe Kotaro actually...

283
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:29,354
What're you two doing in secret?

284
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:36,054
The metal on its collar is rusted.

285
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,554
I wonder if it's because we take him for walks even on rainy days.

286
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:42,554
I get it.

287
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:50,254
All right, I'm sorry to have taken up your time,

288
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,454
but you may go now.

289
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:55,454
I'll drive you to the hospital, Mrs. Takiguchi.

290
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:56,854
Thank you all.

291
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,854
Will you please wait.

292
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,354
Is there something you'd like to say?

293
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,754
Oh, no.

294
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,454
This not just a mere accident.

295
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:09,954
It is a carefully schemed homicide.

296
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:12,154
What? What was that?

297
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,754
What?

298
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:17,254
But, Mr. Takiguchi dove into the sea himself.

299
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:21,654
Yes, but if he knew that the wouldn't be able to swim,

300
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:25,454
he probably wouldn't have dove in of his own initiative.

301
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:27,754
Mr. Takiguchi, although he couldn't swim

302
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:29,854
was made to believe that he could

303
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:31,454
and suddenly taken off shore

304
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:34,954
where his feet couldn't touch the bottom.

305
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,254
Wouldn't this be considered nothing but murder?

306
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:41,154
Correct, Mrs. Nao Takiguchi?

307
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:43,854
My husband could swim.

308
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,454
You saw for yourself too, didn't you?

309
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:50,154
Are you saying that there was some trick involved in that image?

310
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:53,654
No, that image is genuine.

311
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:56,054
Mr. Takiguchi could swim.

312
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:58,154
What on earth are you getting at?

313
00:17:58,154 --> 00:17:59,754
However...

314
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:02,454
Only in the pool of his home.

315
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:03,454
Conan!

316
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:04,754
Yes!

317
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:07,554
Please lend it to me.

318
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:12,254
Please look at Nao's necklace here during his swimming practice.

319
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:15,954
See. It's sunk underwater, isn't it?

320
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:18,154
But, on the last day...

321
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:20,154
See, it's floating on the water!

322
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:21,254
What?

323
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:22,554
Let me see.

324
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:29,654
The necklace that was sunk is afloat.

325
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,154
What is the meaning of this?

326
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:33,454
Will you explain it in simple terms for me?

327
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:37,854
Why is the necklace afloat?

328
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:40,654
Coro pointed it out.

329
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,054
The metal on the collar of Coro

330
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:48,054
who is still on a year old is for some reason already rusted.

331
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:52,754
Mrs. Takiguchi poured a large amount of bath salt into the pool.

332
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:55,854
So that the body would float more easily.

333
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:59,054
The necklace in the video was acrylic.

334
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:04,354
The specific gravity of acrylics is 1.17 to 1.2,

335
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:07,254
so the specific gravity of the pool water the other day,

336
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:10,054
would've had to be heavier than that.

337
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:13,154
Correct, Mrs. Takiguchi?

338
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:16,154
No, if I put that much bath salt in the water,

339
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,754
no matter how dense my husband is, he would've noticed.

340
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:20,954
Then, what did you insert?

341
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,754
The necklace that sank in the sea

342
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,454
is afloat in the video image, you know?

343
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,854
Either way, this video is proof

344
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:32,054
that the specific gravity of the pool water is heavy.

345
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:35,754
Shall we go over to your residence and check it out now?

346
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:37,754
There's no water even if you did.

347
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:40,954
The water of the pool has been drained.

348
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:43,154
Don't take the police lightly.

349
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:45,754
Just a minimum amount of residue in the pool

350
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:49,454
is enough to determine what was dissolved there.

351
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:54,854
Mrs. Takiguchi, is what he's saying true?

352
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:56,154
How about it?

353
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:00,354
Nao, it's not true, is it?

354
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:05,054
It's true.

355
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:09,154
It is... it's just as he said.

356
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:12,054
At first I poured in bath salt but,

357
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:16,554
when I increased the amount, he noticed it.

358
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:19,854
From then I switched over to using water soluble polymer.

359
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:23,954
To a non-toxic substance used in drugs and foodstuff.

360
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:27,554
The specific gravity of the pool water last week

361
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:30,054
would've probably been over 1.3.

362
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:34,454
1.3 would mean that you could float on your back and read a book.

363
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:37,254
It's the same as that of the Dead Sea.

364
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:38,954
It's understandable that Mr. Takiguchi

365
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:43,354
would be under the mistaken impression that he could swim.

366
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:47,254
I guess you took the video as a safeguard

367
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,954
in case you were interrogated by the police,

368
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:53,854
but that video on the contrary gave you away.

369
00:20:56,054 --> 00:21:02,354
All that guy had in mind till now was to enlarge his company.

370
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:03,854
If to pursue his purpose,

371
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:07,654
he'd use whatever way he had to no matter how dirty.

372
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:11,454
He probably had no idea how many people suffered because of him.

373
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:16,454
So, I was thinking of making him suffer,

374
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:20,454
but I just couldn't bear living with a guy with no common sense

375
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:23,454
or sophistication any longer.

376
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:27,954
I've had it.

377
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:32,254
It may be true that Mr. Takiguchi was desperate trying to make money

378
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:35,654
and didn't have any common sense nor sophistication

379
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:38,954
but wasn't he more human than you,

380
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:42,554
who took someone's life just for the sake of revenge?

381
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:14,554
I was so sure that she was a nice person and yet...

382
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:16,454
I thought that she was nice

383
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:18,654
when we were eating over at her place.

384
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:21,654
I don't trust adults anymore!

385
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:24,154
There are all kinds of adults.

386
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,154
-An array of them. -Exactly!

387
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,854
I still possess a pure heart!

388
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,854
Did you say something?

389
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:34,554
By the way, where's the left over lunch boxes?

390
00:23:34,554 --> 00:23:37,054
That's right. Thanks to the lunch we were invited to,

391
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,754
we still have our lunch boxes!

392
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:40,454
Let's hurry and eat it!

393
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,154
Now that you mentioned it, I'm hungry.

394
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:45,154
I wonder what the side dish for today is?

395
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:51,254
Hey! I thought you guys were depressed.

396
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:54,554
Oh, true! You're carrying Tai!

397
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:58,254
This cat is my granddaughter's pet cat!

398
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:01,854
These people came claiming that they are the owners.

399
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:05,154
No, I'm the real owner.

400
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,954
No, you're not! I'm telling you it's me, aren't I?

401
00:24:07,954 --> 00:24:10,754
He's not ordinary.

402
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:13,754
Let's ask the master of solving mysteries to join us too.

403
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,054
Next Conan,

404
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:21,054
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 1)".

405
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:39,554
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:41,054
"Taii"
