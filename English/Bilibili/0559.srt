1
00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:03.449
The House of Hope.

2
00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.749
Six young people once inhabited it.

3
00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:09.049
However, three years ago,

4
00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.949
ever since one of the women out of the six,

5
00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.249
died due to a heart attack,

6
00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.549
people began calling the House of Hope, the House of Death.

7
00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.749
The only man who remained living in the house alone

8
00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.349
called Mr. Shusaku Akashi

9
00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.649
was the husband of Aoi, the woman who died.

10
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.649
Mr. Akashi had been locked up

11
00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.949
in one of the rooms of the house by someone

12
00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.249
and left to starve to death.

13
00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.549
Just before Mr. Akashi died, he left a queer message behind.

14
00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:39.149
One side of the wall in the room was entirely painted red.

15
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.849
Moreover, a chair painted white faced the red wall,

16
00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:44.149
while a chair painted black

17
00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.249
faced the white wall on the opposite side

18
00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.649
and both were nailed to the floor.

19
00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.849
Mr. Akashi was found dead sitting in the white chair.

20
00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.049
Rival of Inspector Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

21
00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.849
Inspector Takaaki Morofushi

22
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.649
better known as Inspector Koume of the local police station

23
00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.149
and we, ended up working to solve the mystery together, but...

24
00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.349
What on earth is the red wall trying to relay?

25
00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:13.849
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

26
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.549
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

27
00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.149
Suspects of various color.

28
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.549
The incident heads in an unexpected direction

29
00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.249
with the occurrence of a second case.

30
00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:22.749
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.349
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.049
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:10.702
He offered flowers?

34
00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:13.502
Oh, I forgot to mention it,

35
00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:16.302
but Inspector Morofushi and Inspector Yamato

36
00:03:16.302 --> 00:03:20.502
were classmates with Aoi who died in this warehouse three years ago.

37
00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:23.102
-Class... -Classmates?

38
00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:26.602
Inspector Morofushi was classmates with Ms. Aoi Kobashi

39
00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:30.102
who passed away in the warehouse of this house three years ago?

40
00:03:30.102 --> 00:03:32.302
Is it just a coincidence that the same inspector turns out

41
00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:36.602
to be the one to first discover the corpse of Mr. Shusaku Akashi?

42
00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:43.702
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Mercy)"

43
00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:46.402
I stopped over here

44
00:03:46.402 --> 00:03:48.902
because that day happened to be the memorial date of her death.

45
00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:51.002
I came to offer her flowers and was about to go home

46
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.402
when I noticed that below that window, that was cracked,

47
00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:55.602
a lot of paint was scattered about,

48
00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.002
so I got suspicious.

49
00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.302
I rang the doorbell but got no answer,

50
00:03:59.302 --> 00:04:01.302
so I went to the front door that wasn't locked

51
00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:03.702
and went inside together with him

52
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:07.702
then found the corpse that was locked up in the room.

53
00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:11.102
But I heard that the fingerprints of the victim

54
00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:14.102
were found on the scattered paints.

55
00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:17.102
Yeah. On every one of them.

56
00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:20.702
But on the doorknob of the room and the spray can,

57
00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:23.902
the fingerprints of your subordinate were found.

58
00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:27.702
It's indeed like bamboo shoots in the snow.

59
00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.302
Very interesting.

60
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.602
Huh, bamboo shoots in the know?

61
00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:33.802
It's not in the know, but in the snow.

62
00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.002
He said, bamboo shoots in the snow.

63
00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:39.602
Why would bamboo shoots appear here?

64
00:04:39.602 --> 00:04:41.902
Bamboo shoots appear in spring, right?

65
00:04:41.902 --> 00:04:45.502
That's why in China, when something impossible happens

66
00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:47.302
or when you get hold of something that is really hard to get,

67
00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:49.602
that phrase is used!

68
00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:52.402
But, what's impossible?

69
00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:54.102
Can't you tell?

70
00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:57.102
The victim was locked up in this room, you know.

71
00:04:57.102 --> 00:04:59.102
He would naturally place his hands on the doorknob

72
00:04:59.102 --> 00:05:01.702
attempting to go outside, wouldn't he?

73
00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:05.202
The fingerprints of the victim should also be found on the spray can

74
00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:07.302
that he used to paint the wall red too, right?

75
00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:09.602
Besides, the very person who locked him in here

76
00:05:09.602 --> 00:05:11.602
doesn't look to have returned here!

77
00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:13.502
True.

78
00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:15.902
And, the victim's fingerprints

79
00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:18.302
not being found where they should've been

80
00:05:18.302 --> 00:05:21.702
could mean that the culprit had to wipe them off for some reason.

81
00:05:21.702 --> 00:05:23.202
Or...

82
00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:24.502
At any rate,

83
00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:28.702
maybe it may be a good idea to meet with the four

84
00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:31.202
who used to live here before.

85
00:05:31.202 --> 00:05:33.502
This time, we should con then into talking.

86
00:05:33.502 --> 00:05:37.302
Go see them yourself if you want to!

87
00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:39.202
And, while you're at it,

88
00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:44.502
keep that eyesore brat and girl in your car for a while.

89
00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:46.802
In the meantime, I want to get my head together

90
00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:49.902
with the Sleeping Kogoro that I called all the way out here

91
00:05:49.902 --> 00:05:52.502
and find out what really happened in order to solve the case!

92
00:05:54.502 --> 00:05:58.702
Things that I wouldn't want kids to hear about may come up too.

93
00:06:00.202 --> 00:06:04.102
Well, after you meet the four, drop the kid and the girl over at my house,

94
00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:06.402
when you come back to report what you found.

95
00:06:06.402 --> 00:06:09.902
Although I don't think you'll get much.

96
00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:28.902
And? Shall we start talking about the case...

97
00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:32.402
Hey, he's sleeping!

98
00:06:35.202 --> 00:06:38.002
That's why Kan-chan sent Conan along with him.

99
00:06:52.002 --> 00:06:54.202
"Midorikawa"

100
00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:57.502
You're the inspector I met the other day.

101
00:06:57.502 --> 00:07:01.302
I've told you everything I know about Shusaku who passed away.

102
00:07:01.302 --> 00:07:02.502
The thing is,

103
00:07:02.502 --> 00:07:06.202
your fingerprints were found on the doorknob of the room

104
00:07:06.202 --> 00:07:09.002
that Shusaku was locked up in.

105
00:07:10.102 --> 00:07:14.002
But, six years have already gone by since I've lived there.

106
00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:18.102
Fingerprints that old can still be detected?

107
00:07:18.102 --> 00:07:21.202
Which means that you haven't been back to that place

108
00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:23.302
since you left six years ago?

109
00:07:23.302 --> 00:07:26.902
-Right. -Don't, Conan.

110
00:07:26.902 --> 00:07:29.502
What's with them? These children.

111
00:07:29.502 --> 00:07:34.402
Well, I'm taking care of them for a while, you see.

112
00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:37.702
I told you, didn't I? To stay in the car.

113
00:07:37.702 --> 00:07:43.502
Because I've got to tell Pops what kind of people you are.

114
00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:45.602
I don't mean to be rude,

115
00:07:45.602 --> 00:07:47.902
but you appear on TV a lot, don't you?

116
00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:49.902
Huh? Yes.

117
00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:53.502
Maybe the name Naoki Sone sounds better?

118
00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:56.602
Oh! I know that name!

119
00:07:56.602 --> 00:07:59.302
You appear as the bad guy in samurai movies.

120
00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:02.602
Sone is my mother's maiden name.

121
00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:05.102
So, I changed my pen name to it.

122
00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:09.102
When I was living in that house, I was called Midori,

123
00:08:09.102 --> 00:08:11.702
so I figured that if I didn't change my name,

124
00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:14.102
I couldn't stand on my own two feet after leaving the house.

125
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:18.002
So, you were called by color by the people who lived in that house.

126
00:08:18.002 --> 00:08:19.202
Yeah.

127
00:08:19.202 --> 00:08:22.002
But since Shusaku and I were childhood friends,

128
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.602
we called each other by our names.

129
00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:38.102
"Yamabuki Design"

130
00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:40.202
Oh my. My fingerprints

131
00:08:40.202 --> 00:08:43.302
were found on the doorknob of Mr. Akashi's room?

132
00:08:43.302 --> 00:08:45.602
Why, of course,

133
00:08:45.602 --> 00:08:49.202
because I used to live there before, after all!

134
00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:52.002
If you used to call Mr. Akashi Aka,

135
00:08:52.002 --> 00:08:54.702
then he must've called you Yamabuki?

136
00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:57.802
Yes. After all, that's my name as is.

137
00:08:57.802 --> 00:09:02.402
But, I think that only Ao-chan used to call me Yama-chan.

138
00:09:02.402 --> 00:09:05.702
That person called Aoi, what kind of person was she?

139
00:09:05.702 --> 00:09:09.402
Well, to put it flatly, she was everyone's madonna.

140
00:09:09.402 --> 00:09:12.302
After all, she was the only woman among the six of us,

141
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.302
and beautiful too.

142
00:09:14.302 --> 00:09:17.302
That's why when we found out that she was going with Akashi,

143
00:09:17.302 --> 00:09:19.602
we were all surprised.

144
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:23.702
That's why everyone left that house.

145
00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:26.402
It goes for me too.

146
00:09:26.402 --> 00:09:28.202
I see.

147
00:09:36.102 --> 00:09:39.402
"Studio Momo"

148
00:09:39.402 --> 00:09:40.502
Huh?

149
00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:44.202
My fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Aka's room?

150
00:09:44.202 --> 00:09:47.402
Hey, don't tell me that you're suspecting me an inhabitant

151
00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:49.902
that once lived there because of something like that?

152
00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:52.602
I mean, who knows when it got there in the first place!

153
00:09:52.602 --> 00:09:55.802
No. I'm only confirming just in case.

154
00:09:55.802 --> 00:09:59.402
Did everyone used to call you Momo, sir?

155
00:09:59.402 --> 00:10:01.602
Yeah. I hated it

156
00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.602
because there was a dork who used to call me Pink at times!

157
00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:06.502
Pink...

158
00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:11.502
Which means that you never went back to the house after leaving it?

159
00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:15.102
Oh, I forgot to mention it.

160
00:10:15.102 --> 00:10:17.602
I went there once about four years ago

161
00:10:17.602 --> 00:10:21.102
to deliver a game software that I helped create.

162
00:10:21.102 --> 00:10:23.302
A game software?

163
00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:27.102
Yeah. It was just a simple chess game.

164
00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:31.402
Aka and Ao-chan both liked chess so...

165
00:10:42.102 --> 00:10:43.902
What?

166
00:10:43.902 --> 00:10:49.502
My fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Aka's room?

167
00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:50.902
Yes.

168
00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:53.402
That's why I'm only confirming just in case.

169
00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:56.102
That can't be...

170
00:10:56.102 --> 00:11:00.302
I mean I used to live there before too.

171
00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:02.302
Oh! Wait!

172
00:11:02.302 --> 00:11:05.502
I dropped by the house about six months ago.

173
00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:09.802
At that time, I may have touched Aka's art tools too.

174
00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:12.702
Oh, Aka stands for Akashi, that's the way everyone called him.

175
00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:15.502
Then, were you called White, sir?

176
00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:17.402
Yeah.

177
00:11:17.402 --> 00:11:19.902
I was never called by my last name!

178
00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:23.502
Oh, no, I've got to go to a meeting with my band members!

179
00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:25.902
May I be excused?

180
00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:28.102
I've got to get going!

181
00:11:28.102 --> 00:11:30.802
Then, see you later.

182
00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:42.902
Yeah. It's me.

183
00:11:48.402 --> 00:11:50.102
I see.

184
00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:53.702
You conned everyone into talking by telling them

185
00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:57.802
that their fingerprints were found on the doorknob of Akashi's room.

186
00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:00.002
And? Did you get anything?

187
00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:01.402
Yes. Well...

188
00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:04.202
There is! A person who's really suspicious!

189
00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:05.702
He was really flustered

190
00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:07.702
and even volunteered to remark that he touched the art goods

191
00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:10.402
when he visited although he wasn't questioned about it!

192
00:12:10.402 --> 00:12:12.402
Who's that guy?

193
00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:14.302
Mr. Shiro Naoki!

194
00:12:14.302 --> 00:12:16.502
Shiro Naoki?

195
00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.402
Come to think of it,

196
00:12:18.402 --> 00:12:20.702
when we went to ask him questions the last time,

197
00:12:20.702 --> 00:12:23.902
-he acted really uncomfortable, didn't he? -Yeah.

198
00:12:23.902 --> 00:12:25.902
I had my eyes on him too.

199
00:12:25.902 --> 00:12:28.302
But, I had no concrete evidence either.

200
00:12:28.302 --> 00:12:30.402
Well, it's already late tonight.

201
00:12:30.402 --> 00:12:32.502
Let's hit the sack tonight and then at the break of day,

202
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:37.502
let's have Shiro Naoki come to the police station voluntarily.

203
00:12:46.902 --> 00:12:51.502
What? You found out who starved Shusaku Akashi to death?

204
00:12:51.502 --> 00:12:53.602
-Seriously? -Yeah.

205
00:12:53.602 --> 00:12:55.302
After sleeping one night and thinking things out,

206
00:12:55.302 --> 00:12:57.302
an idea flashed through my mind!

207
00:12:57.302 --> 00:13:00.302
And? Who is it, the culprit?

208
00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:04.902
It's the one you said was weird last night, Shiro Naoki.

209
00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:08.502
The victim Mr. Akashi was sitting in the white chair

210
00:13:08.502 --> 00:13:11.002
and right in front of him is the red wall.

211
00:13:11.002 --> 00:13:14.802
In other words, the red color was meant to indicate himself!

212
00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:16.602
Then, what about the black chair?

213
00:13:16.602 --> 00:13:19.302
Black of course refers to the culprit!

214
00:13:19.302 --> 00:13:22.202
What can the man see sitting in the black chair?

215
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:25.202
Oh! The white wall! I see!

216
00:13:25.202 --> 00:13:27.002
He wanted to tell us that the culprit

217
00:13:27.002 --> 00:13:29.702
was Mr. Shiro Naoki who was called, White.

218
00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:31.702
Exactly.

219
00:13:32.602 --> 00:13:34.302
I hate to put your words right back into your mouth.

220
00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:37.102
-But that deduction... -Let him be, Uehara.

221
00:13:37.102 --> 00:13:38.602
It's too much trouble.

222
00:13:38.602 --> 00:13:39.902
But...

223
00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:43.702
What the... in front of the apartment...

224
00:13:47.102 --> 00:13:48.702
Is something wrong?

225
00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:51.202
Kan-chan, that...

226
00:13:51.202 --> 00:13:52.402
Koume?

227
00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:54.002
Inspector Morofushi.

228
00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:01.302
Hey. Don't tell me...

229
00:14:01.302 --> 00:14:04.002
Yes. I had this strange ominous feeling inside of me

230
00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:06.002
and rushed over here...

231
00:14:06.002 --> 00:14:08.102
And this is what I saw.

232
00:14:19.802 --> 00:14:22.002
Red... red wall.

233
00:14:22.002 --> 00:14:24.702
He probably saw our moves last night

234
00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:26.902
and quickly decided to take the upper hand.

235
00:14:26.902 --> 00:14:30.102
Move as swift as a wind?

236
00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:32.702
Yes. Something you have a hold of

237
00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:35.902
may not really be what you have a hold of.

238
00:14:35.902 --> 00:14:37.402
He beat us to it.

239
00:14:37.402 --> 00:14:39.602
Huh? Let's drink shochu,

240
00:14:39.602 --> 00:14:41.302
let's make sure to drink potato shochu. (Japanese rhyme)

241
00:14:41.302 --> 00:14:42.802
Oh, it's...

242
00:14:42.802 --> 00:14:44.802
Something you have a hold of

243
00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:48.102
may not really be what you have a hold of.

244
00:14:48.102 --> 00:14:50.402
Just because you have something in the palm of your hand,

245
00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:52.602
it doesn't necessarily mean you can grasp it for sure.

246
00:14:52.602 --> 00:14:54.002
Huh?

247
00:14:54.002 --> 00:14:57.502
In other words, we were off our guard

248
00:14:57.502 --> 00:15:00.802
and had the man who carried the key to solving this case murdered

249
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:03.402
right before our eyes

250
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:06.302
and lost the clue we could've had!

251
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.083
The man who was killed

252
00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.683
was Mr. Shiro Naoki, age 36, a musician.

253
00:15:21.683 --> 00:15:23.683
The estimated time of death

254
00:15:23.683 --> 00:15:26.683
is last night between 10:00 to 11:00.

255
00:15:26.683 --> 00:15:31.883
The cause of death is suffocation due to strangulation.

256
00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:35.083
Judging from the fact that the victim was made to sit in a chair

257
00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:38.383
and that in front of that chair there

258
00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:40.183
was a closet with a door painted red

259
00:15:40.183 --> 00:15:44.183
with a spray can that was found on the floor near the feet of the victim.

260
00:15:44.183 --> 00:15:45.983
It is highly likely that the culprit is the same man

261
00:15:45.983 --> 00:15:48.783
who confined Shusaku Akashi in his room

262
00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:52.083
and starved him to death.

263
00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:54.883
A red wall. Again.

264
00:15:55.883 --> 00:15:57.283
Which means that

265
00:15:57.283 --> 00:16:00.783
this red wall is again a dying message left behind by the victim.

266
00:16:00.783 --> 00:16:02.283
No.

267
00:16:02.283 --> 00:16:05.483
In order for Mr. Shiro Naoki to have painted the wall red,

268
00:16:05.483 --> 00:16:08.483
he would've had to do it before he was strangled to death.

269
00:16:08.483 --> 00:16:09.983
And again,

270
00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:12.383
it's hard to believe that he would leave this room

271
00:16:12.383 --> 00:16:16.583
in such a weird condition before he met the culprit here.

272
00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:19.383
Then, what with this red wall...

273
00:16:19.383 --> 00:16:20.383
Don't tell me...

274
00:16:20.383 --> 00:16:23.883
Yes. I'm sure the culprit deliberately painted the wall red.

275
00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:26.283
Hey, isn't it strange?

276
00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:30.583
Why would the culprit leave a dying message indicating who he is behind?

277
00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:33.283
He's making fun of us, the police!

278
00:16:33.283 --> 00:16:34.483
Yes.

279
00:16:34.483 --> 00:16:36.783
It could be that he re-did the red wall incident

280
00:16:36.783 --> 00:16:39.483
that Mr. Akashi left behind at this site

281
00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:43.183
in order to challenge us.

282
00:16:43.183 --> 00:16:47.083
"Come solve this mystery, and catch me if you can"

283
00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:50.283
At any rate, it's clear now that

284
00:16:50.283 --> 00:16:52.683
the suspect is a former resident of that house

285
00:16:52.683 --> 00:16:55.483
where Shusaku Akashi used to live.

286
00:16:55.483 --> 00:16:58.183
Actor Naoki Midorikawa

287
00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:01.683
and fashion designer Shoji Yamabuki.

288
00:17:01.683 --> 00:17:06.283
CG creator, Takuto Momose. One of them did it.

289
00:17:06.283 --> 00:17:08.883
Why?

290
00:17:08.883 --> 00:17:14.283
We've only told those three and Mr. Naoki who was killed

291
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.383
about the wall being painted red

292
00:17:17.383 --> 00:17:21.083
and the fact that Mr. Akashi was seated in a chair.

293
00:17:22.383 --> 00:17:26.783
But, we haven't said anything about

294
00:17:26.783 --> 00:17:29.683
Mr. Akashi having been seated in a white chair,

295
00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:32.483
and that there was a black chair behind it,

296
00:17:32.483 --> 00:17:34.383
with both chairs being nailed to the floor.

297
00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:35.683
Although the culprit tried to re-do

298
00:17:35.683 --> 00:17:38.283
the site where Mr. Akashi starved to death,

299
00:17:38.283 --> 00:17:43.083
it seems that all he could do was make him sit in the seat.

300
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:46.683
I wonder if the culprit got scared.

301
00:17:46.683 --> 00:17:49.283
Because he tried to copy the dying message,

302
00:17:49.283 --> 00:17:52.783
despite not knowing much about it!

303
00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:55.183
I guess so.

304
00:17:55.183 --> 00:17:57.883
Well, I'd like to go ask the three

305
00:17:57.883 --> 00:18:03.083
where and what they were doing between 10:00 to 11:00 last night.

306
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.383
I want to discuss the truth of this incident

307
00:18:05.383 --> 00:18:09.083
with Sleeping Kogoro here so...

308
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:10.483
Koume, I hate to trouble you

309
00:18:10.483 --> 00:18:14.683
but will you keep that kid and girl in your car again...

310
00:18:16.383 --> 00:18:19.083
If you warn someone for their own good,

311
00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:21.583
but they refuse to listen, say no more and let them be.

312
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:24.483
That way, you don't have to embarrass yourself.

313
00:18:24.483 --> 00:18:25.483
Huh?

314
00:18:25.483 --> 00:18:27.683
Kansuke, it seems that

315
00:18:27.683 --> 00:18:32.183
you want me to work together with that good-looking lad.

316
00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:34.583
But, I guess I'll refuse this time.

317
00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:39.183
I will go and investigate on my own.

318
00:18:39.183 --> 00:18:43.483
But, of course I give you my word that as soon as I solve the case,

319
00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:46.683
I will report it to you first thing.

320
00:18:47.783 --> 00:18:49.383
Bye.

321
00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:53.383
Gosh.

322
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:56.483
Hey, what was that thing just now

323
00:18:56.483 --> 00:18:59.783
about a warning or something?

324
00:18:59.783 --> 00:19:03.383
If I remember correctly, those are the words of Confucius.

325
00:19:03.383 --> 00:19:05.683
When someone does wrong,

326
00:19:05.683 --> 00:19:08.483
it's okay to warn of the wrongdoing with justice at heart.

327
00:19:08.483 --> 00:19:11.583
But, if it proves futile, let it be.

328
00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:15.183
Being too persistent will end up in yourself having to feel bad,

329
00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:16.383
and will be ineffective.

330
00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:18.083
I think that's what it means?

331
00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:20.383
But what is the wrongdoing?

332
00:19:20.383 --> 00:19:22.783
Remember, about the time when Kan-chan was pursuing a case,

333
00:19:22.783 --> 00:19:25.183
and was struck by an avalanche.

334
00:19:25.183 --> 00:19:27.183
He hurt his left eye and left leg at that time

335
00:19:27.183 --> 00:19:30.283
and his whereabouts became unknown?

336
00:19:30.283 --> 00:19:34.083
Back then we weren't able to contact Kan-chan for days,

337
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:37.283
but Inspector Morofushi ignored his superior's orders,

338
00:19:37.283 --> 00:19:39.983
went over to a police with jurisdiction in a different prefecture

339
00:19:39.983 --> 00:19:41.783
and pursued the culprit that Kan-chan was going after

340
00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:44.183
with aggressive investigation, took custody of him,

341
00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.383
then made him spit out that they were struck by an avalanche

342
00:19:46.383 --> 00:19:48.983
and found Kan-chan in the hospital!

343
00:19:48.983 --> 00:19:51.183
He had to take responsibility for what happened then

344
00:19:51.183 --> 00:19:54.083
and was transferred to a local police station.

345
00:19:54.783 --> 00:19:56.483
He owes him for that time too, so...

346
00:19:56.483 --> 00:19:58.283
I think Kan-chan's trying to team him up with the boy

347
00:19:58.283 --> 00:20:01.083
so that Morofushi won't go off again on his own

348
00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:03.583
making rash investigations.

349
00:20:03.583 --> 00:20:06.883
I mean, because you're really smart, Conan.

350
00:20:07.883 --> 00:20:10.983
But he just investigated aggressively back then

351
00:20:10.983 --> 00:20:14.083
because he wanted to find you as soon as possible.

352
00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:15.283
In the case of this incident, this time...

353
00:20:15.283 --> 00:20:16.783
There's a chance that

354
00:20:16.783 --> 00:20:19.183
he may plunge into aggressive investigation!

355
00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:20.383
Do you know?

356
00:20:20.383 --> 00:20:23.183
About the book titled "Koume of 2nd grade class A".

357
00:20:23.183 --> 00:20:25.683
Oh, I've read it before.

358
00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:27.783
It's a story about a renown detective classmate

359
00:20:27.783 --> 00:20:31.583
solving queer incidents that occur, right?

360
00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:34.383
The author of that book is Aoi Kobashi

361
00:20:34.383 --> 00:20:37.983
who died in the warehouse of that house three years ago,

362
00:20:37.983 --> 00:20:39.983
as well as being Shusaku Akashi's wife!

363
00:20:39.983 --> 00:20:40.983
What?

364
00:20:45.483 --> 00:20:48.383
And, making an appearance in that book

365
00:20:48.383 --> 00:20:51.983
is a model figure of the detective, her classmate.

366
00:20:51.983 --> 00:20:55.983
Takaaki Morofushi!

367
00:20:56.683 --> 00:20:58.383
Come to think of it,

368
00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.883
a detective from the classroom next door

369
00:21:00.883 --> 00:21:03.583
who spoke roughly also appeared...

370
00:21:03.583 --> 00:21:04.883
Could that have been...

371
00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:06.783
I'm pretty sure that the model was Kan-chan.

372
00:21:06.783 --> 00:21:08.483
At any rate,

373
00:21:08.483 --> 00:21:11.483
if these serial killings were committed

374
00:21:11.483 --> 00:21:15.183
because of a grudge against Aoi Kobashi's death,

375
00:21:15.183 --> 00:21:19.283
Koume will at all costs get right to solving the case!

376
00:21:19.283 --> 00:21:21.883
He still really treasures that book

377
00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:26.283
and even keeps it in his glove compartment.

378
00:21:29.383 --> 00:21:30.383
Uehara!

379
00:21:30.383 --> 00:21:33.083
Hail a cab and go after Koume's car!

380
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.083
I'm going with Kogoro to meet the three in question!

381
00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:37.283
Yes, sir.

382
00:21:37.283 --> 00:21:38.983
I know you already know,

383
00:21:38.983 --> 00:21:42.083
but don't take your eye off Koume even for a second.

384
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:43.883
Yes, sir.

385
00:21:45.883 --> 00:21:49.583
If you don't want him to get carried away in his investigation,

386
00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:52.083
you should just go with him.

387
00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:54.883
I think he wants to watch him in hiding.

388
00:21:54.883 --> 00:21:57.383
Last night when we went to look over the place

389
00:21:57.383 --> 00:21:58.683
where Inspector Morofushi and the suspects were,

390
00:21:58.683 --> 00:22:01.283
there was a strange car following us too.

391
00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:05.783
That's a car from the police, right?

392
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.083
Yeah.

393
00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:10.083
But why would you want to keep watch?

394
00:22:10.083 --> 00:22:13.483
We just told you that the three in question

395
00:22:13.483 --> 00:22:16.683
knew about the red wall that was left behind at the scene, right?

396
00:22:16.683 --> 00:22:21.983
Of course, we police personnel know of the facts.

397
00:22:21.983 --> 00:22:25.483
Moreover, if that guy liked Aoi Kobashi

398
00:22:25.483 --> 00:22:27.683
and worked in the police station,

399
00:22:27.683 --> 00:22:29.883
wouldn't it be natural to keep watch over him?

400
00:22:29.883 --> 00:22:32.083
Then, don't tell me...

401
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:33.483
Yeah.

402
00:22:33.483 --> 00:22:38.483
Takaaki Morofushi is also a suspect!

403
00:24:04.883 --> 00:24:08.183
What? You lost track of Koume?

404
00:24:08.183 --> 00:24:10.083
I'm sure Koume is headed for the house!

405
00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.583
Head there on the double!

406
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.083
What? What's written?

407
00:24:15.783 --> 00:24:18.783
Koume... dies...

408
00:24:18.783 --> 00:24:20.883
It's on fire!

409
00:24:20.883 --> 00:24:22.583
The House of Death!

410
00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:24.783
What?

411
00:24:24.783 --> 00:24:26.383
Koume... don't tell me that...

412
00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:28.983
He beat us to it again!

413
00:24:28.983 --> 00:24:30.183
Next Conan,

414
00:24:30.183 --> 00:24:34.265
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Koume Dies)"

415
00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:52.719
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:54.719
"Surgical gown"

417
00:24:54.719 --> 00:24:55.819
According to my deduction, the culprit

418
00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:58.019
is the one with the color "black" in his name!

419
00:24:58.019 --> 00:24:59.790
-No such person's made an appearance. -What?
