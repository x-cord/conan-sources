1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,040
Codes and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,640
The seven steps of decorative Hina dolls.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,240
The mystery of the burglar that is hidden in the red steps.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:46,967
Look, look at that Hina doll!

9
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,667
How beautiful!

10
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,167
Yes.

11
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,867
Oh, so Girls' Day Festival is right around the corner.

12
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,167
I really like that Hina doll.

13
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,767
But, you've already got a nice one at home, Ayumi.

14
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,667
Hey, did you forget?

15
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,967
Last year you dropped the girl Hina doll

16
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:12,567
and its hands and neck broke off, right?

17
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,167
Oh, that's right!

18
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,067
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

19
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,767
But, I guess you can have it repaired.

20
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:20,967
Of course she did.

21
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,867
But while the craftsman was repairing the doll,

22
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:27,467
he got hurt and blood splattered on the face of the doll.

23
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,767
When the doll was finally repaired,

24
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:34,167
Peach the dog next door

25
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:39,467
came up to Ayumi holding the doll's neck in its jaw.

26
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,467
The paint that was used to cover the blood on the face

27
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,767
was peeled off,

28
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,767
its hair was disheveled

29
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:47,367
and it was wearing a dreadful facial expression.

30
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,067
Hey.

31
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:51,467
Seriously, that doll is cursed!

32
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:55,167
Yes. Ever since then, the doll set

33
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,667
was securely packed away in a box by Ayumi's father

34
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,967
who was worried that the dolls may bring upon misfortune.

35
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,067
Hey!

36
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:05,167
I hear that it is still way deep inside the closet...

37
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,767
It's not cursed.

38
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:16,967
Peach brought the doll to me wanting to show it to me as soon as possible.

39
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:20,667
And, the neck of the doll just happened to fall off then.

40
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,867
-Hey. -Hey, Ayumi.

41
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,967
Don't cry.

42
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:32,867
Just playing.

43
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,767
Peach's owner asked an acquaintance of his for me,

44
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,667
so that person is going to give me a set of Girls' Festival dolls

45
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,567
that she isn't using anymore!

46
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,467
It has seven rows of dolls and is larger than the one I had!

47
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,967
She says I could have the doll set if I can line them up correctly

48
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,167
without looking at anything for reference!

49
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,667
But you'd have to line up quite a number of dolls

50
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,967
if the set has seven rows to it.

51
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,767
Can you handle it alone?

52
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:57,967
I'll be just fine,

53
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,067
because I memorized how the dolls are line up over and over!

54
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,267
And besides, I'm not going to do it alone.

55
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:12,467
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 1)"

56
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,167
Hi, Ayumi!

57
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,867
So, did you memorize how the dolls are to be lined up?

58
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:20,667
You didn't look too confident when you came last time so...

59
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,867
Yep, no problem!

60
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:27,867
Okay, then I guess I'll have you line them up right now.

61
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,767
Are these all boxes with dolls in them?

62
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,767
Why do you have to memorize how the dolls

63
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,167
are supposed to be lined up, though?

64
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,467
Because she thinks that Ayumi's going to make a mistake.

65
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,967
The fact is, she doesn't want to give it away.

66
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:42,867
That's not exactly it.

67
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,667
We're just checking to see

68
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,567
if she's a girl that will take good care of the dolls.

69
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,667
Learning to line the dolls up correctly

70
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,467
will give rise to more affection towards the dolls, no?

71
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,567
After all, they are very precious dolls

72
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:59,867
that were bought for me.

73
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,467
I wish you luck then, little lady!

74
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:05,467
Thank you!

75
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,467
There.

76
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:13,467
Oh, Genta, that's not right.

77
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:16,467
The man with the bow and arrow belongs more to the top!

78
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:21,167
Yeah, but the more the merrier!

79
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,367
No! You've got to line them up correctly.

80
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,067
And, while you're at it, that old man is the minister of the left

81
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,467
and belongs on the fourth step to the very right.

82
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,967
The young one that looks a lot like him is the minister of the right

83
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,367
and belongs on the same step to the very left,

84
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,867
so don't get them wrong!

85
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:39,067
The left belongs to the right and the right belongs to the left...

86
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:43,667
You know so much despite being a boy.

87
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:49,267
I helped Ran a lot when I was a kid.

88
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,867
You used to line them up when you were a kid too, didn't you?

89
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:54,467
Oh, didn't I tell you?

90
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:59,367
I was sent off to the States to study as early as I can remember

91
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:03,467
so this is the first time I'm even touching these dolls.

92
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:06,667
It seems my parents got my older sister Girls' Festival dolls

93
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,667
but my parents died soon after I was born too, so...

94
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,167
Besides, my sister never took the dolls out

95
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:16,767
because they brought back sad memories.

96
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:24,367
How did your parents die?

97
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,467
Well, it seems that my sister was told that

98
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,167
they died of an accident during some research they were doing.

99
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,867
Come to think of it, I remember that

100
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,567
Pisco once mentioned that your parents were scientists.

101
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:38,367
Yes, although my mother was not all that well known.

102
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,367
My father, Atsushi Miyano

103
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,167
seems to have been pretty well-known in the field

104
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:48,167
as a mad scientist who was ousted from academic circles.

105
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,167
As a mad scientist?

106
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,867
Hey, what the heck are you talking about?

107
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,767
You developed that drug because you took over

108
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,567
what your parents were doing, didn't you?

109
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,467
Just what kind of drug was it?

110
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,067
A secret drug...

111
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:05,067
A secret drug that's used to revive the dead.

112
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,567
Will this answer satisfy you?

113
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,967
Then, don't tell me

114
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,467
the stuff that was written in the diary was...

115
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,867
Just as I thought.

116
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,567
The thing you were looking at on the computer the other day

117
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,167
was a clue to those people, wasn't it?

118
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,867
And after you traced the clue,

119
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,767
you found out where they stopped by

120
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,667
but aside from what you expected, while you were waiting for them,

121
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,467
you overslept.

122
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,767
I guess the story went something like this.

123
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,167
Yeah, well, sort of.

124
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,667
Well, you don't have to worry.

125
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,267
The goal of my research

126
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,967
has nothing to do with making a dream-like drug like that.

127
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,467
Most of the people here on earth

128
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:48,467
would find no value in the stuff I'm involved in now.

129
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,667
That's right.

130
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,767
It's like the Girl's Festival dolls that are important

131
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:57,467
only for the girls of this small country.

132
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:07,167
Let's go from the top. The Emperor, the Empress.

133
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,567
Three Court Ladies, the Five Musicians,

134
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,867
the two "guardians", the Minister of the Left and Minister of the Right.

135
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,467
And on the fifth step are the Three Pages,

136
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:18,367
expressing the human emotions of laughter, worry and anger!

137
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,967
You've passed with flying colors!

138
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,867
Then, are you going to give me this doll set?

139
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:26,267
Yes! I'll have it delivered to you by courier right away!

140
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,367
-All right! -Make sure you thank grandma later, okay?

141
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,567
Okay!

142
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,767
Shall we start cleaning up, then?

143
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,167
We went out of our way to line them up,

144
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,167
and we're going to put them away already?

145
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:40,167
It can't be helped, because it has to be packed to send out.

146
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,267
Oh, wait! Let's all take a picture in front of it first!

147
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,467
I brought daddy's digital camera with me!

148
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,267
Okay, here goes.

149
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,067
Say cheese!

150
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,767
My, I wonder who it is.

151
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,467
Oh, Mr. Tsumagari of Room 503.

152
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,567
Hello.

153
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,667
If it's about that thing, I'm sure my husband already refused.

154
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:12,267
Yes, but I just can't give it up.

155
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,667
I brought an appraiser with me today,

156
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,367
and I thought I'd ask him one more time.

157
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:19,867
How do you do?

158
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,567
This way, please.

159
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:25,067
This is really something.

160
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,767
This is a fine Hina doll set.

161
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,567
A famous doll craftsman in Kyoto seems to have made it.

162
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,367
And? How much will you sell it to me for?

163
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:38,467
Are you buying these dolls?

164
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,267
Too late, mister!

165
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,767
They were already given to Ayumi!

166
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:47,867
No, I don't have a daughter so I'm not interested in dolls!

167
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,367
What I want her to sell me

168
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,767
is the hanging scroll behind all of you.

169
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,067
That's the Thunder God that was drawn

170
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,867
by an artist of the Edo era named Tetsuyama.

171
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,967
I have the Wind God which is the other half of this hanging scroll,

172
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:03,467
and I really want to make it a complete set.

173
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:06,467
But, my husband says he has no intention of selling it,

174
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,167
and besides, it doesn't look to be something so valuable.

175
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,067
Huh? Don't you know?

176
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,267
How valuable that hanging scroll is!

177
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:15,767
Do you have any idea how much insurance

178
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,767
your husband's late father placed on it?

179
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,667
Well, no.

180
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,767
20,000,000 yen! It's 20,000,000 yen!

181
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,567
That much?

182
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:28,867
I told your husband that I would pay him double that.

183
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:33,867
Besides, I feel sorry for this hanging scroll.

184
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,367
If kept in this manner, the value of this scroll will go down.

185
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:39,667
I think it'd be wiser to sell it

186
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,667
to a professional collector like Mr. Tsumagari.

187
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,667
But my husband...

188
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:46,467
We will not sell it.

189
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,167
No matter how much money you dish out for it.

190
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,167
Mother...

191
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,167
Okay, I'll be back again tonight

192
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,367
just about the time your husband comes home.

193
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:00,167
I'm sure he'll agree to sell it.

194
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,367
If I mention the story about him making a great loss in stocks...

195
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:11,567
Let's put away the dolls and hurry on home too, then.

196
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,367
How nostalgic.

197
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:19,067
It's already been 10 years since we last decorated them.

198
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,367
The dolls look happy that they were taken out of the box

199
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:24,567
after such a long time too.

200
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,267
Mother.

201
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:31,667
Ayumi, would it be okay to decorate these dolls here

202
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,067
until Girls' Day Festival this year?

203
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,367
I guess mother wants to say goodbye to them.

204
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:38,167
Sure!

205
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,267
But, can I stay here a while longer then?

206
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,267
Because I have one more picture I want to take.

207
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:48,067
Why don't you have mother serve you some sweet sake then?

208
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:52,367
I thought we were out of the ingredients to make it from scratch.

209
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,567
Oh, no.

210
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,767
I have to go out soon too.

211
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:01,367
I'll go buy it then! The supermarket is right there!

212
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,067
Thank you very much!

213
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:08,167
Ayumi, isn't it about time you tell us?

214
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,867
Just what do you want to take a picture of?

215
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,467
A picture of all of us having a good time!

216
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,267
We just took one like that a while ago!

217
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:18,367
Something even better.

218
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,267
Which way was it?

219
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,567
This way.

220
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,467
Okay, just a little while more to go!

221
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,867
Come on, let's go.

222
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:32,967
Oh, okay!

223
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,467
I think it was just around this corner.

224
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,867
Isn't that the appraiser?

225
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,867
I thought you went home.

226
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:46,267
Well, I forgot my cell phone.

227
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:50,267
I called my cell phone, then the lady answered

228
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:53,067
and told me that it's in the living room.

229
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,967
She told me I could get it when I go over tonight,

230
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:59,467
but I may get important phone calls so...

231
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,267
I decided to pick it up now.

232
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:03,967
But, it seems that no one's home.

233
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,667
You mean grandma isn't home?

234
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,967
Oh, he's right. Nobody's home.

235
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,467
No one is here...

236
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,667
Hey, the door's not locked!

237
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,667
Grandma, are you sleeping?

238
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,567
What is this sound?

239
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,867
I think it's the sound of the fax machine.

240
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,667
It's coming from this room.

241
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,967
What the heck is going on?

242
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,767
The room is super messed up!

243
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,867
The fax seems to be from her husband.

244
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:51,167
Hey.

245
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,267
That doesn't seem to be the only place.

246
00:13:54,967 --> 00:14:00,367
Burglary. A burglar broke in after we left.

247
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,667
By the looks of it, maybe the other rooms are messed up too.

248
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,867
Ayumi!

249
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:11,967
I'm glad. The dolls seem okay.

250
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,867
This room looks untouched.

251
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:18,267
I wonder where grandma is, though.

252
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:23,267
It seems that grandma's not the only one who disappeared!

253
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:24,767
Look!

254
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,167
The hanging scroll of the Thunder God is gone too.

255
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:37,047
Let's call the police! Please call the police!

256
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,347
Okay!

257
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,447
Grandma?

258
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,047
Oh, so I did miss you, after all.

259
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,447
Where were you, grandma?

260
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:50,447
Well, when I looked, I found out that I had also run out of sugar,

261
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,147
so I went to buy some.

262
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:56,547
By the way, why are you all looking pale-faced about?

263
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,247
Well, the thing is...

264
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,147
Setsuko, I thought you went out.

265
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:05,547
I forgot my wallet so I came back to get it.

266
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:06,747
The bedroom's...

267
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:07,947
Oh, my.

268
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:11,047
Oh, so we were just about to call the police...

269
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,247
Mr. Tsumagari!

270
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,447
What's up? I heard somebody scream.

271
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,547
Oh, well, the thing is...

272
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,547
A burglar, a burglar broke in!

273
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:29,147
Let's talk after the police get here.

274
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:33,247
I see, so from what I've gathered here...

275
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:37,347
Those children came here to decorate the Hina dolls,

276
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:40,747
and after that Mr. Tsumagari who extremely

277
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,347
wanted the hanging scroll that was stolen,

278
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,947
brought appraiser, Mr. Mie with him.

279
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:50,047
Officer, I don't really go for that remark.

280
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:55,647
And after the two men left, you five went out shopping.

281
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,947
Yeah, to buy the ingredients for making sweet sake!

282
00:15:57,947 --> 00:15:59,447
Ingredients for sweet sake?

283
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,347
Mother was going to make sweet sake for everyone,

284
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,347
but we were out of the necessary ingredients.

285
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:08,547
Since I had to go out, I asked the children to go get it.

286
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:13,047
After that you were here alone, Grandma Yayoi?

287
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,647
Yes, exactly.

288
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,647
Did you notice anything then?

289
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,547
Like strange noises.

290
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,547
It was quiet,

291
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:27,047
until the cell phone that he forgot in the living room rang.

292
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,347
Yeah.

293
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:31,947
Oh, you forgot your cell phone in the living room?

294
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:34,347
We were shown into the living room first,

295
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:37,747
because the children were in the Japanese room.

296
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,647
But, we wanted to see the hanging scroll as soon as possible,

297
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:42,847
so forced our way immediately into the Japanese room.

298
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,247
And, after the phone call,

299
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:48,747
you seem to have gone out shopping too, but for what?

300
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,847
I went out to buy sugar.

301
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:55,947
I realized that we were out of sugar, so I rushed out to get some.

302
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:58,947
Do you know about what time it was?

303
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:04,047
Well, it was right after I hung up so...

304
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:06,347
Then, I can tell what time it was!

305
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:09,047
Just before I hung up, I heard the sound

306
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,447
of the fax machine on the other side of the line,

307
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,247
so if we look at the time the fax was sent,

308
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,347
we can find out what time it was!

309
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,247
Who was the fax from?

310
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,247
I think it was from my husband.

311
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,147
Then where is that original fax?

312
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:25,647
In the living room.

313
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:31,947
My God, they really went all out messing up the room.

314
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:35,047
So this is the fax you received from your husband.

315
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,347
Yes.

316
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,747
15:28.

317
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:42,147
What else was stolen besides the hanging scroll?

318
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:47,147
Nothing. Only here and the bedroom were ransacked.

319
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:50,647
Even the wallet that was on the shelf above the TV

320
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:52,947
was left untouched.

321
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,847
May I have a minute with you, Officer Momose?

322
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:57,647
It seems that the burglar

323
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,447
broke in from the veranda facing this window.

324
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,447
Just as I thought.

325
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,847
Why do you think that this is the way the burglar broke in?

326
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,647
We're on the 6th floor.

327
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,347
It's a common target

328
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:11,447
for burglars who use a rope to get down from the roof.

329
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:15,447
They seem to think that people living on the top floor of condos are rich,

330
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:18,447
and most times the windows aren't locked anyway.

331
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,947
You sure know a lot, don't you, Haibara?

332
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:25,047
Yes, because I live with an old man who likes to watch wide-shows on TV.

333
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:27,447
If I'm not mistaken, you're the first ones

334
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:31,047
who realized that the room was ransacked?

335
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:35,347
Yeah, when we got back from shopping, the front door was unlocked.

336
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,747
And when we heard the sound of the fax machine

337
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,947
and came into the living room, it was all messed up!

338
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:44,047
At that time, the clock on the fax was 15:40!

339
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,347
Which means that the burglary took place

340
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:50,447
between 15:30 and 15:40, a period of 10 minutes.

341
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,747
I wonder.

342
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:54,847
The burglar went down on the veranda

343
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,047
and came in through that window, right?

344
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,947
If it were me, I'd be too scared to come in.

345
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:04,347
See, if you close the window,

346
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:07,947
nothing is in view from the veranda because of the curtain.

347
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,647
If the burglar opens the window wanting to look inside,

348
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,247
the curtain would flutter in the wind,

349
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,147
and the lady on the phone would notice.

350
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:20,147
And, besides the time the fax was sent out all show 15:28!

351
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:23,347
Which means that the fax kept coming in

352
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:27,047
all the while we were out shopping until we came back, right?

353
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:30,747
Do you think a burglar would break into a room

354
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:32,747
where noise is constantly coming from?

355
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:35,747
But, it's just the sound of the fax.

356
00:19:35,747 --> 00:19:38,347
The more so frightening because it's the fax!

357
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:41,547
Because if the fax completes coming in and the buzzer sounds,

358
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,147
somebody in the house may come to take a look at it!

359
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,747
I see.

360
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:51,147
Beside, it's strange that the burglar didn't notice her wallet

361
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,347
and if the burglar couldn't find what he was after,

362
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:56,047
wouldn't all the other rooms be ransacked too?

363
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:57,847
True...

364
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,447
The strangest thing is,

365
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:04,447
why only the hanging scroll was stolen.

366
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:07,547
But, that hanging scroll is worth 20,000,000 yen.

367
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:10,447
You idiot, only a professional would know

368
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,347
if that scroll is really worth that price.

369
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:18,847
Which means that the burglar knew that the scroll was here to begin with.

370
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,347
Yeah.

371
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:22,947
But if the burglar was after the scroll,

372
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,547
the other room wouldn't have been ransacked.

373
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,147
Maybe the burglar messed up the other room

374
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:31,047
just to throw people off, so that he's not suspected.

375
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:34,747
Which means that the culprit has no definite alibi

376
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:39,047
and on top of that had to face the police reluctantly after the incident.

377
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:44,247
Furthermore, that person knows the value of that hanging scroll!

378
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:47,247
Come to think of it, you were loitering around

379
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,747
in front of this house, weren't you?

380
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,747
I just told you, didn't I?

381
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:53,147
That I came to get my cell phone, but nobody was home.

382
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:55,447
But, the door wasn't locked!

383
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,847
Well...

384
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:59,447
Did you lock the door when you left the house?

385
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:04,947
Well, I think I did, but I was in a rush so...

386
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:08,747
By the way, why were you at the front door a while ago, mister?

387
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,647
I came to check things out

388
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,347
because Mr. Mie didn't come back for some time.

389
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:17,747
-Were you all here? -Yes.

390
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:22,347
Then, you also knew that he forgot his cell phone, right?

391
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:28,347
Yes, since he was by me until I started talking to grandma.

392
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:30,247
You mean you left while he was on the phone?

393
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,347
I just went to buy some cigarettes!

394
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:35,747
In other words, just as this child just said,

395
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:39,047
you two do not have an alibi yet.

396
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,347
Hey, will you cut out just suspecting us?

397
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:46,247
Those two are going to get 20,000,000 yen too

398
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:48,347
if insurance money comes in!

399
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:53,747
I'm just saying even you two can carry out something like this!

400
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:57,047
-What a thing to say? -Stop it.

401
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:00,547
We sure are in a fix.

402
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:03,247
All four of you have motives, no alibi and on top of that,

403
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,947
all of you are capable of carrying out the crime.

404
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:08,847
The key to nailing down the culprit is...

405
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,347
in the Japanese room!

406
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:50,347
Hey, Conan.

407
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,747
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

408
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,847
Oh, sorry,

409
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,447
I'm in the process of thinking now.

410
00:23:56,447 --> 00:24:00,147
But we better hurry or the steps will...

411
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,147
But the steps...

412
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:07,347
Thanks, Ayumi! I've solved the mystery!

413
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,947
Next Conan,

414
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:13,447
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 2)"

415
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:16,215
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:18,315
"Steps"

417
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,415
-Today is March 3rd. -Festival for little birds.

418
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,915
-No, it's Girls' Festival. -Piyopiyo. (Mimicking bird sounds)
