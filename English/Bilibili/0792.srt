1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,440
And?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,240
Why did you confirm time and again

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,840
whether people were tailing us and called us here?

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,340
I don't think you wanted to show us

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,940
how good you've become in disguising yourself, did you?

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,140
No.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,840
This morning, Kir...

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,640
I got mail from Reina Mizunashi.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,440
-What? -Then,

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,740
it seems that those guys still don't know

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,440
that you're alive, Mr. Akai?

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,540
No, probably not. I received text mail

13
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,940
but it consisted only of three letters of the alphabet.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,740
Three letters of the alphabet?

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,840
An abbreviation of something?

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,340
No. It's the name of a liquor that both of you know very well of.

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,340
R-U-M. RUM.

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,740
Their code name.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,940
RUM?

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,440
When I was at the Organization,

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,240
I heard that name two or three times.

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,140
It seems to be the name of a close aide to the boss.

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,640
Aide?

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,440
But I got no such info.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,240
Judging from the looks of it, because only the letters were sent over,

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,840
circumstances may have been so urgent

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,140
that she had no time to text you anything.

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,840
Just go and tell James that the big shot's

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,640
going to start making a move, will you?

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,240
Somebody greater than Gin.

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,840
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,940
Love and cases come from the same origin.

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,840
A child watches three adults.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,040
The testimony of a witness leads to a crime.

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,940
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:21,461
"The Three First Discoverers (Part 1)"

39
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,161
By the way, did you see it?

40
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,261
The Tokyo Derby yesterday?

41
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,861
The match between the Spirits and Noir, right?

42
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:32,061
I did, I saw it! Hide did a hat-trick, right?

43
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:35,061
It's no wonder he's their star player!

44
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:37,061
-"Lum"? -Yeah.

45
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:41,061
You mean the one that says, "Daccha?"

46
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:47,761
Oh, I don't mean the anime character,

47
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,261
but it's the name of liquor.

48
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,561
The kind that pirates often drink.

49
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:53,661
No. I'm not familiar.

50
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:58,361
I told you before, I don't know much about liquor.

51
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,561
Right.

52
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,561
In order to get information on "Rum" the close advisor of the boss

53
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,361
of the Black Organization,

54
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,061
we'd have to wait for Ms. Rena Mizunashi

55
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,261
who has snuck into the Organization, to contact us.

56
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,461
Or, to make Mr. Amuro, of the security police

57
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,461
who has also infiltrated the Organization tell us.

58
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:20,161
But...

59
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,161
I do know that

60
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:27,761
the code name of number two of the Organization is Rum.

61
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,561
Number two?

62
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,561
At least when I was there, that's what I heard.

63
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:36,261
We've never met, though.

64
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:40,061
What kind of person? A man, a woman?

65
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,061
I just told you, we've never met, didn't I?

66
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:48,361
When I was at the Organization, I've heard rumors of all descriptions.

67
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,461
A large brawny man.

68
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,761
An effeminate man.

69
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:55,661
An aged man.

70
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,061
Some claimed that they were all his doubles.

71
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:03,161
A large brawny man, an effeminate man, and an aged man.

72
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,361
Hey! I hope this Rum person

73
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:08,161
hasn't started some kind of search for me?

74
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,461
No.

75
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:12,561
The code names of the ones in the Organization are all liquor, right?

76
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,061
So, I was just wondering if there was

77
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,361
a person named Rum among them too.

78
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,861
What's Run?

79
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,861
You were talking about it just now!

80
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,961
Rum's searching, or something like that.

81
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,461
Tell us. I want to know!

82
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:29,061
Oh. Rum...

83
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,361
Rumune.

84
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,661
Rumune?

85
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:35,961
Well, after playing soccer in the park, you get thirsty, right?

86
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,861
That's why I was looking for it

87
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,461
wondering if they sell it at the candy store

88
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:41,861
on the other side of the street!

89
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,261
Oh. You mean the rumune drink?

90
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,461
Why not ordinary juice?

91
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,261
I... I guess so.

92
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:51,461
That boy's still there.

93
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,661
That boy?

94
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:56,761
See. That boy standing on the other side of the street.

95
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:59,061
He was standing there on our way to the park,

96
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,161
and looking in the distance back then too.

97
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,161
I wonder what he's looking at.

98
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:08,461
Maybe somebody looks to be falling from a high place?

99
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,161
Let's go, ask him!

100
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,561
Yes!

101
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:19,061
Ahead of him. An apartment?

102
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,961
Hey, there. What on earth are you...

103
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:29,161
The lady's... the lady was killed!

104
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:30,261
What?

105
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,561
Did you see her get killed?

106
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,461
I didn't but she told me this.

107
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,561
"There are going to be three men"

108
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,361
"coming into my room one after the other now."

109
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,261
"If after those men leave,"

110
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,861
"I don't come out of the room."

111
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:52,961
"I would probably have been killed, so call the police."

112
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,861
Which means that the lady...

113
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:58,361
She hasn't come out.

114
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,661
It's already been about 30 minutes

115
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,661
since the third man came out and yet...

116
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:08,261
And, did you call the police?

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,461
I'm so frightened that I haven't called them yet.

118
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,461
The three men.

119
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:15,061
Do you remember what they were like?

120
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,261
Yeah.

121
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,461
A big man.

122
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:21,361
A young man with long hair that looked like a woman.

123
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,661
An old man with super white hair.

124
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,161
What?

125
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:30,361
A large brawny man.

126
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:32,761
An effeminate man.

127
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,561
An aged man.

128
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,961
Hey! Don't tell me that's...

129
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,961
I guess it fits in too good to be a coincidence.

130
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:46,361
But, I'm sure there was another characteristic about Rum.

131
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,761
Although descriptions of his outward appearances were varied...

132
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,561
The characteristic was always the same.

133
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,061
I can't remember what it was though.

134
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:58,761
Will you take us to the lady's room?

135
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,961
It's that apartment, isn't it?

136
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,561
Yes.

137
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:14,161
And? This lady is your aunt?

138
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,061
Your relative?

139
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,161
Nope.

140
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,061
I don't know the lady.

141
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,761
-What? -She's a total stranger to you?

142
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:22,761
Yes.

143
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:27,061
She used to play with me a lot when I played in the park alone.

144
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:31,061
Because I just moved over here, and have no friends.

145
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:36,161
But, your mother knows about that lady, right?

146
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:37,661
No, she doesn't.

147
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:40,761
Because I don't have a mom or dad.

148
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,361
Oh...

149
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,561
Yes. While I was on excursion,

150
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,961
they got messed up in the "Goto" murder case.

151
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,561
Goto (Robbery) murder case!

152
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:55,261
That's why I'm staying at my uncle's place right now,

153
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:58,461
but he's too busy and can't play with me.

154
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,961
So, that lady who saw how lonely you were

155
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,661
decided to keep you company playing.

156
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:09,761
Yes. I told her before that I wanted to go to her house,

157
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,761
but she wouldn't let me.

158
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,961
Today, she told me that it was special and invited me over!

159
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:19,361
She makes scripts for TV dramas.

160
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,261
And told me many, many stories of the scripts

161
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,661
she was going to write about from now!

162
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,261
A scriptwriter?

163
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,161
Aunty!

164
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:33,561
-There's... -No answer.

165
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,361
Wait.

166
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,661
The door's not locked!

167
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,361
No, don't go inside!

168
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:43,061
She told me that if she didn't come out,

169
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,761
to call the police, leave everything to them,

170
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,561
and to not come inside.

171
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,661
That's...

172
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,261
I thought so.

173
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,061
-Aunty. -No! Stay outside!

174
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,261
Haibara, call the police!

175
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,861
Okay.

176
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:08,561
Shouldn't we call the ambulance too?

177
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:09,761
No.

178
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:12,161
Look at her feet!

179
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,661
If this is a real suicide,

180
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:17,261
the footstool should be knocked over at her feet.

181
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:19,561
But, there's nothing here.

182
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:21,661
In other words, somebody killed her

183
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,661
and tried to make it look as if she committed suicide.

184
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:29,361
One of them that he saw probably committed the crime.

185
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:34,161
If about 30 minutes had passed since the third man left here,

186
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,461
it's already too late...

187
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,361
Oh, no...

188
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,861
But, it's strange.

189
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:46,161
Although being in such a rush, the perp

190
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:49,561
forgot to put the footstool under her feet to frame a suicide,

191
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:53,161
there are no traces of anyone having left in a hurry.

192
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,261
Besides...

193
00:10:57,261 --> 00:11:00,861
There are no Yoshikawa Lines showing that the victim resisted

194
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,861
before being strangled.

195
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:08,461
I can see if the victim was put to sleep and hung at once but...

196
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,361
If the incident was that calculated,

197
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:13,561
would the footstool be forgotten?

198
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,561
An envelope?

199
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:24,461
"Tohto Bank" -A bank envelope.

200
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,561
And, it's still new.

201
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,161
Which means,

202
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,061
inside the wallet on the desk...

203
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,061
There should be money that was just withdrawn.

204
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:39,561
But there's practically nothing left inside.

205
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:43,261
The only thing inside is the detailed statement from a bank ATM.

206
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:47,661
According to this, 500,000 yen was withdrawn 3 hours ago,

207
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:52,061
and yet that money is nowhere in sight.

208
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:55,961
Which means... is this a robbery homicide?

209
00:11:57,061 --> 00:12:00,661
Well, either way, a sloppy job like this...

210
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,961
is for sure not what they would do.

211
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:07,161
Yeah.

212
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,453
I see.

213
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:28,653
Then, you were asked by that lady to watch her apartment,

214
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:32,553
and after three men came in one after the other,

215
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:36,753
you came here and discovered this?

216
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:37,853
Yes.

217
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:42,953
The person who died was scriptwriter Yasue Komai, correct?

218
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,453
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,753
If this is a homicide,

220
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,153
I guess we've got no choice but to find someone

221
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,953
among her acquaintance who has a grudge against her,

222
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,853
and have them come to the police

223
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:56,453
and have him identify the man.

224
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:58,353
Oh!

225
00:12:58,353 --> 00:12:59,653
If you're talking about the three

226
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,753
who were supposed to meet the victim here today,

227
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,253
I've got their names.

228
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:04,553
What?

229
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:08,653
It's written on the schedule software in the computer on the desk.

230
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,453
After noon today, meet with Ronpei Sakaba,

231
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:15,953
Kuramichi Habanaka, and Denji Shibakaru.

232
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:17,553
Really?

233
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,653
Yes.

234
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:21,853
It's written in the notebook that was found in the drawer

235
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:23,853
as well as on the calendar,

236
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,953
so I think there's no doubt about it.

237
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:30,453
And, there is no sight of the 500,000 yen

238
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,553
that she withdrew either.

239
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:34,753
So, the perp killed her for the money,

240
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:38,253
set it up to look like suicide and fled.

241
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:42,553
Then, let's investigate the identity of the three immediately and...

242
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:46,853
What's the matter?

243
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,453
They...

244
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,753
they're there.

245
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:53,153
The ones who were in her room a while ago.

246
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,753
The... the three!

247
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,553
No joke?

248
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,153
Can you point to the three

249
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:03,153
without sticking your face out of the railing?

250
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:04,353
Yes.

251
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,953
-Are they there? -Yes.

252
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:22,053
Over there. The large brawny man.

253
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:25,653
The young long-haired man diagonally beside him.

254
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:28,453
And the old man behind him!

255
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,153
Inspector Megure!

256
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,853
Yeah, I got it!

257
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:42,753
-Officer Takagi. -Yes, sir!

258
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:03,553
Hey. Give me a break, officer.

259
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:05,253
I just came to look because I heard

260
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,253
that something happened in the neighborhood.

261
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:10,953
And yet why do I have to be interrogated?

262
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,053
I'm just a passerby spectator.

263
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:16,953
Are you saying I look like some wanted criminal?

264
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:20,053
No. There was an eye-witness

265
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,453
who testified that between the hours of 2pm to 3pm,

266
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,053
the estimated time of death of the victim,

267
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:29,253
you three went into the room of the victim one after the other.

268
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:33,053
The eye-witness also mentioned that

269
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:37,253
he was asked by the victim Ms. Yasue Komai

270
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,853
to watch her apartment

271
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:43,353
because she may be killed by one of the three men

272
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:46,853
that will be coming.

273
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,853
Killed? Didn't she commit suicide?

274
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,653
-Suicide? -Because if she had hung herself,

275
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:55,353
wouldn't it normally be considered suicide?

276
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:58,853
Why do you know that the victim hung herself?

277
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:00,453
Oh, well...

278
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:03,653
It seems we can't hide things around here.

279
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,553
I'm Denji Shibakaru.

280
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:07,853
I got to know her coincidentally at a pub.

281
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:12,153
We kicked it off good together and were drinking partners.

282
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:14,753
This picture is proof of it.

283
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,453
She told me she wanted to discuss something

284
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,553
that was bothering her so I came.

285
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:21,853
But, I didn't think she was so cornered as to hang herself.

286
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,653
Then, when you came, she was already...

287
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:29,153
Yeah, so I don't know what was bothering her.

288
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:33,553
If you want to know what is what, you may as well ask these two.

289
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:36,453
Although I don't know who or where they're from.

290
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,253
I...

291
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:43,153
came to get the money she owed me back!

292
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:44,953
She's been an old friend of mine,

293
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,653
so I lent her a large sum of money

294
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,053
but I ended up suddenly needing it for myself

295
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:52,053
so I came to ask her to return it.

296
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,653
Was that amount 500,000 yen?

297
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:58,253
How did you know?

298
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:01,453
So, is he the one that took the money?

299
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:07,353
I'm the producer of Tohto TV.

300
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:10,953
And had Ms. Komai writing me the script

301
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,153
for the Special Autumn Mystery,

302
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:17,353
and she said she had finished it, I came to pick it up.

303
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,353
Then, where is that script?

304
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:22,753
I found it right by the entrance,

305
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:25,753
so took it with me and gave it to the assistant director.

306
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,153
Had the victim already hung herself at that time?

307
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:30,253
Yes.

308
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:34,153
I don't know what was bothering her either

309
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,153
but it was a script written right before deadline,

310
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:39,653
so I had no time to be thinking about it.

311
00:17:39,653 --> 00:17:41,553
But...

312
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:44,553
If you see something like that,

313
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:49,153
wouldn't it be normal to call the police?

314
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,653
True. No matter what else may be on your mind.

315
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:55,353
You would, right? For sure.

316
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,353
If you knew the lady that died, the more so!

317
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:00,653
Why?

318
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,853
It couldn't be that you had reasons

319
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:06,353
for not being able to call the police...

320
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,253
No.

321
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,353
You brat, stay out of this!

322
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:13,353
Who's that boy wearing glasses?

323
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,253
Please don't let outsiders butt in.

324
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,853
They're the first discoverers of the corpse

325
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:22,853
that coincidentally happened to be there.

326
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:28,653
Well, it sounds as if you're the actual first discoverers, though.

327
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:32,553
Well, I'd like to hear you all out individually,

328
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,553
so go inside separately, will you?

329
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,953
If... if it's alibi that you need, I've got it!

330
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,453
Alibi?

331
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:42,553
The money was actually supposed to be deposited by 2pm

332
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:46,253
but when I confirmed it at the bank ATM, it wasn't.

333
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,553
So, I came here directly to pick it up.

334
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:54,353
I saw her hanging and dead, so I freaked out.

335
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:57,453
And rushed back to the ATM.

336
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,653
It was my credit card payment due date was today,

337
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,353
so I had to pay with the money I had on hand.

338
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:06,353
And? How's that an alibi?

339
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:11,153
We... well, every ATM has a security camera, right?

340
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:15,253
If you check the time when I left that ATM for a moment and came back,

341
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:19,053
and calculate the time it takes to make a round trip to that bank,

342
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:22,953
you'll see that I had no time to commit murder!

343
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,353
Well, I don't know if you can call that an alibi but...

344
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,253
it'll help the investigation.

345
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:31,153
Is that bank near here?

346
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,353
Yeah. Pretty close.

347
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:37,753
Then, I'll go with him to that bank and confirm!

348
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:39,653
Okay.

349
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:43,553
While we're waiting, is it okay to smoke?

350
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:46,053
I have a portable ashtray with me.

351
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,853
It's okay but since it's getting windy,

352
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,053
take care not to scatter the ashes around.

353
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,553
All right.

354
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,953
The flames... so big!

355
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,553
Sorry, was it smoky?

356
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,453
Oh, not really.

357
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:12,653
And? You really don't remember

358
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:15,353
in what order the three men came here?

359
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,753
Nope.

360
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:19,753
Although I know it was them.

361
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,953
I guess I've got no other choice

362
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:25,553
but to ask them for more details after all.

363
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,153
I see.

364
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:37,753
You're sure that he was on the security camera of the bank?

365
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,353
Yes.

366
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:41,853
Is it okay to smoke here?

367
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,653
I guess I'll take a puff too, then.

368
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,553
However, Inspector...

369
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:52,753
He was away from the ATM for more than 40 minutes,

370
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,653
so it won't serve as an alibi at all.

371
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,453
It doesn't even take 20 minutes to get to that bank you see.

372
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:00,853
Then, why did he go out of his way to say so?

373
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:03,553
He tried to flee several times on the way,

374
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,753
so maybe that's what he was planning to do.

375
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,753
Darn!

376
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,553
Young lady, would you like to use this?

377
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:11,653
Oh. Thanks.

378
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:13,953
Geez.

379
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,453
You don't have to glare at me like that.

380
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:18,653
I won't flee anymore!

381
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:21,753
I was just playing around.

382
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:33,753
I mean... why don't we hurry

383
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:36,253
and get on with the interrogation or what not's?

384
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,253
Yeah, right.

385
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:41,453
Let's start with you, then.

386
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:43,453
Me?

387
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:47,453
Okay. Be kind, okay?

388
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,853
I see.

389
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,253
Did you find something out?

390
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:57,453
Yeah. The perp who committed the murder and...

391
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:59,253
That boy's name.

392
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:01,953
Officer Takagi.

393
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:06,753
I think you'd better search the room a little more thoroughly.

394
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,953
I'm positive that the 500,000 yen is somewhere inside.

395
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:13,053
-What? -One more thing.

396
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,253
Will you lend me 20,000 yen?

397
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:21,053
Next Conan, "The Three First Discoverers (Part 2)"

398
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:38,653
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:41,053
"500,000 yen"

400
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:42,453
I wonder how many bowls of eel over rice I can eat.

401
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:44,353
Eels are expensive nowadays, you know.

402
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:45,953
Your love for eels over rice is amazing.
