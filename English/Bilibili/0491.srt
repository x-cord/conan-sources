1
00:00:01.858 --> 00:00:03.558
And, how was it?

2
00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:05.258
Did you find out about the old man

3
00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:07.258
who used to know Eisuke Hondo as a child?

4
00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:09.758
You got to talk to his grandson, didn't you?

5
00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:12.258
-Yeah. -What do you mean, "Yeah..."

6
00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:14.058
Tell me about it.

7
00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:16.258
I'm a bit concerned too, you know.

8
00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:19.158
I got to meet the grandson of the man who said he knew the man

9
00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:20.658
and his friend.

10
00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:22.758
They gave me a lot of information

11
00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:24.358
and a picture.

12
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:25.458
A picture?

13
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.158
Oh, of Eisuke Hondo when he was a child,

14
00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:32.758
a man behind him that's supposed to be his father.

15
00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:34.858
Wow, you did it, Kudo!

16
00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:37.858
And? Do you remember seeing that man somewhere?

17
00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:39.558
No, I don't.

18
00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:46.058
According to his grandson's friend, he seems to have said,

19
00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:47.658
"The time has come to dive."

20
00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:48.758
"Dive?"

21
00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:50.958
And the man's friends seem to have said things like,

22
00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.758
"Give it your best shot." Or, "Take care."

23
00:00:55.758 --> 00:00:57.358
When you say "dive",

24
00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:00.358
it usually means going underwater or into the sea, right?

25
00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:02.658
Yeah, since the friend of the grandson

26
00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:05.458
was told that the man was an office worker,

27
00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.458
he thought that man was going diving or something.

28
00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.858
But more correctly,

29
00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:12.958
that man was just any other office worker

30
00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.758
who was hired by "the Company."

31
00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:18.158
The company?

32
00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:20.358
Kudo, don't tell me that's...

33
00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:22.258
Yeah, I don't know if that "Company"

34
00:01:22.258 --> 00:01:23.958
is what we think it is

35
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.358
or just any other company.

36
00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:27.758
But, the man told me that the old man

37
00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:29.158
really got along with that man,

38
00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:31.558
and that they used to have deep conversation with each other.

39
00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.958
Taking into consideration that he was an unmatched suspense fan,

40
00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.458
he figured from the way he talked

41
00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:39.458
or characteristic way of saying things...

42
00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:42.858
So he may be a member of "the Company"

43
00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:45.358
that we're thinking of.

44
00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:46.558
Yeah.

45
00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:48.958
But, Kudo,

46
00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.158
if it turns out to be true, it's big trouble.

47
00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:53.458
I think it's best to watch how things go

48
00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:55.558
without doing anything for now.

49
00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:58.258
What would you do?

50
00:01:58.258 --> 00:01:59.858
If you were in my position?

51
00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:02.858
Well, if it were me, I'd just go for it.

52
00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:05.258
I mean, no, I would...

53
00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.358
I'd do exactly what you would.

54
00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:12.058
I'll pry as deep as I can into it.

55
00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:17.458
Until the curiosity within me dries out.

56
00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:20.758
Hey, Conan, just how long are you going to stay locked in there.

57
00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:21.758
I'm leaving without you!

58
00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.458
Oh, sorry, I'll be right out.

59
00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:26.858
Hey, don't tell me you're talking about something important like this

60
00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.058
in the restroom?

61
00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:31.358
I wonder if he has a stomachache or something.

62
00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:33.258
Ran! Let's just leave that brat behind

63
00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:34.658
and go to the hospital.

64
00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:37.958
After all, we're going to visit our intermediate school days classmate.

65
00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.558
But, you haven't eaten lunch yet either, have you, Sonoko?

66
00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:42.458
So, I thought that we could drop by and have lunch

67
00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:44.358
after visiting the hospital.

68
00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:46.458
Because dad is at the horse races

69
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.158
and Conan would have to stay home alone so...

70
00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:51.558
Sorry, Hattori. I'll call you if I find out anything more.

71
00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:54.458
Hey, hold it.

72
00:02:58.158 --> 00:02:59.858
Be careful.

73
00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:01.258
Kudo.

74
00:03:14.358 --> 00:03:15.858
Sizzling hot suspense.

75
00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:18.358
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

76
00:03:18.358 --> 00:03:20.158
Intertwined in the mystery of the Black Organization

77
00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.158
are Eisuke Hondo and Rena Mizunashi.

78
00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:23.958
The curtains of the new series are ready to unfold!

79
00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.458
He sees through the one and only truth.

80
00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.058
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

81
00:03:27.058 --> 00:03:29.558
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

82
00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:05.195
"Red and Black Crash: Prologue"

83
00:05:05.195 --> 00:05:07.295
"West Beika Hospital"

84
00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:09.995
Bye. See you!

85
00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:13.995
I tell you, that Aya.

86
00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:16.095
I mean we rush over super worried because we heard that

87
00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:18.495
her appendicitis was on the verge of bursting.

88
00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:19.595
Yet she turns out looking just great

89
00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:23.395
saying that she wants to fill her stomach with cake and parfait!

90
00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:26.895
All for the better, since she seems to be doing great.

91
00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:30.495
Oh, no. Talking about food made my stomach growl.

92
00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.295
Let's go eat right now then!

93
00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:36.495
The burger shop that opened near here is pretty popular!

94
00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:37.995
Of course they also have

95
00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:41.495
the "children's set" that Conan loves too.

96
00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:43.795
It's the plate that comes with the toy.

97
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:46.395
Then shall we invite him over to come too?

98
00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:47.495
Him?

99
00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:49.195
That klutz!

100
00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:51.195
Oh, Eisuke!

101
00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:52.995
Him!

102
00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.395
Oh, Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki!

103
00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:00.995
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:02.895
Hey, are you all right?

105
00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.695
Yes, somehow...

106
00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:07.395
What brings you all here?

107
00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:09.395
We went to visit a friend at the hospital.

108
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:12.495
Don't tell me that he's come here because

109
00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:15.795
he's aware Rena Mizunashi is hospitalized somewhere?

110
00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:23.195
Isn't this Rena Mizunashi?

111
00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:25.995
You know, the popular announcer that's on leave now?

112
00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:26.995
You're right.

113
00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:28.995
She looks much younger than now, though...

114
00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:30.995
Oh, no,

115
00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:32.095
she's my older sister!

116
00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:33.695
Huh? Older sister?

117
00:06:33.695 --> 00:06:35.995
Not! You mean that announcer!

118
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.995
No, although they look alike, they're not the same person.

119
00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:40.695
Their name's are different to

120
00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:43.895
and besides, my sister left home ten years ago.

121
00:06:43.895 --> 00:06:44.895
She left home?

122
00:06:44.895 --> 00:06:47.095
That's why I'm carrying this picture around

123
00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:48.595
and looking for her.

124
00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.495
But, why are you looking around hospitals?

125
00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.095
Sis used to always say that

126
00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:55.695
she wanted to be a nurse in the future.

127
00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:57.395
Besides, the hospital

128
00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:00.095
is the place where my sister saved me many times.

129
00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.895
I kind of feel that she's somewhere near hospitals.

130
00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:05.695
She saved you?

131
00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:08.295
I was a klutz since I was a child, and not only that,

132
00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:09.995
but also sickly,

133
00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:12.995
so sis used to take me to the hospital all the time.

134
00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:14.995
If I got hurt and bled, she would say,

135
00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:18.895
"You've got to take good care, because God blessed with blood"

136
00:07:18.895 --> 00:07:21.295
"that you can share with everybody else."

137
00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:22.995
But, on the contrary, it turned out that

138
00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:26.095
sis was the one who shared her blood with me.

139
00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:29.895
A little before sis disappeared, I was badly wounded...

140
00:07:36.795 --> 00:07:41.295
and I got a huge amount of blood transfusion from her.

141
00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:43.995
The blood flowing through my body

142
00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:45.895
is my sister's.

143
00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:51.395
I felt my sister's kindness each time my heart throbbed.

144
00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:53.595
However, when I was discharged from the hospital,

145
00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:55.395
my sister was gone.

146
00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:58.095
Maybe she thought that if she stuck around any longer,

147
00:07:58.095 --> 00:08:00.595
she would've had to give you all her blood.

148
00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:02.395
Hey, Sonoko!

149
00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:05.195
I have no idea why sis disappeared,

150
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:06.295
but I want to see her one more time

151
00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:08.895
and tell her thank you from the bottom of my heart.

152
00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:12.495
After all, I'm alive now thanks to her.

153
00:08:12.495 --> 00:08:16.695
A blood type that can be given to anyone.

154
00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:20.995
What he just said doesn't sound like a lie.

155
00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:22.895
I guess it wouldn't be wrong to say

156
00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:26.095
he's looking for his older sister.

157
00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:29.395
That's just like us.

158
00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:34.395
Remember, some time back I gave you a lot of my blood too.

159
00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:36.995
Can you feel my kindness too?

160
00:08:36.995 --> 00:08:39.895
Yep. Sure thing...

161
00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:43.295
But, isn't there a chance that Rena Mizunashi

162
00:08:43.295 --> 00:08:45.495
and your older sister are one and the same?

163
00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:47.095
I don't think that's possible.

164
00:08:47.095 --> 00:08:48.295
Why not?

165
00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.995
If she's on TV, she may not be using her real name?

166
00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.595
Well, yes, but...

167
00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:55.095
Why don't we do this then?

168
00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:58.995
One of dad's friends is a great fan of Rena Mizunashi,

169
00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:02.295
and seems to have video taped her a lot.

170
00:09:02.295 --> 00:09:04.195
So, let's ask him to show them to us!

171
00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:06.195
If you take a good look at her, it may turn out that

172
00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:07.295
she's your older sister, right?

173
00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:08.595
I guess so.

174
00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:10.395
It's okay with me.

175
00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:13.195
Right, why don't we show that picture to him too?

176
00:09:13.195 --> 00:09:15.695
We may be able to find out if it's Rena Mizunashi.

177
00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:17.395
Okay.

178
00:09:19.595 --> 00:09:21.795
Yes, at any rate, let's head off.

179
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.595
Before starting off, let's have lunch!

180
00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:25.895
Let's go.

181
00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:28.095
I'm really craving hamburger right now.

182
00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.295
Yes, hello.

183
00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:42.095
Oh, long time no talk. This is Ran Mouri speaking.

184
00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:43.695
Do you remember me?

185
00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:45.595
He has a dog.

186
00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:48.295
My name is Mouri.

187
00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:50.995
Excuse me, is this Mr. Anno's residence?

188
00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:52.895
No, it isn't!

189
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:55.995
Oh no, I called the wrong number.

190
00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.495
Cool it.

191
00:09:57.495 --> 00:10:00.195
But if Eisuke's older sister

192
00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:01.895
is really Rena Mizunashi, that announcer,

193
00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:03.895
it's big news, you know.

194
00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:08.995
Oh, long time no talk, this is Ran Mouri.

195
00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:10.195
You again.

196
00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:12.395
I'm telling you've got the wrong number!

197
00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:17.095
Strange, it can't be...

198
00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:20.295
Maybe he had to move away suddenly?

199
00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:22.695
But dad didn't say a word about it.

200
00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:25.495
Then, why don't you ask him one more time?

201
00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:27.695
"Bus Stop: Horse Racing Track"

202
00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:36.195
What, Anno's phone number changed?

203
00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:37.295
That can't be.

204
00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:40.095
I asked him to come play mahjong just the other day.

205
00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:42.595
But, when I called, he said I had the wrong number.

206
00:10:42.595 --> 00:10:44.395
Didn't he say anything about moving?

207
00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:47.195
Then, go to his parent's house and ask.

208
00:10:47.195 --> 00:10:48.995
They live near the hospital

209
00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:51.395
you said you were going to visit today!

210
00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:58.595
Huh, you want to know if my son moved?

211
00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:02.595
Yes, when I called a while ago, it seems that his number changed.

212
00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:06.295
Strange. I called him just a while ago.

213
00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:09.395
According to my son, he said that he had a cold

214
00:11:09.395 --> 00:11:11.595
and his voice sounded funny.

215
00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:13.995
He also said that he had to cancel the trip

216
00:11:13.995 --> 00:11:17.395
he was planning to take on Thursday and Friday.

217
00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:19.495
Oh, and he also mentioned that

218
00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:22.795
his cell phone broke yesterday, so his number changed.

219
00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:24.295
Maybe that's it?

220
00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:27.895
No, I called his residence...

221
00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:30.995
You're Mr. Mouri's daughter, right?

222
00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:33.595
I'm sorry, but can we talk about this later?

223
00:11:33.595 --> 00:11:35.295
I'm sort of tied up right now

224
00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:39.195
and got to rush over to the bank.

225
00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:44.995
Didn't your son mention that he was in some kind of trouble?

226
00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:46.595
Yes, sort of...

227
00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:49.095
And I'm sure he went on to say,

228
00:11:49.095 --> 00:11:51.095
"I don't want anybody to know about this,"

229
00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:53.795
"so don't talk about it to anyone"

230
00:11:56.595 --> 00:12:01.995
The fact is, one of his colleagues took company money and fled.

231
00:12:01.995 --> 00:12:04.995
He was about to start a new business and was told that

232
00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:07.195
he had to deposit the money today

233
00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:10.095
or, the company itself would go bankrupt.

234
00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:11.895
So, I told him I'd talk to his father first

235
00:12:11.895 --> 00:12:13.195
and do something about it

236
00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:15.495
but he said he had no time left.

237
00:12:15.495 --> 00:12:18.095
What did he tell you to say when you go to deposit

238
00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:19.595
the money into his account?

239
00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:21.595
Of course he told me to tell the bank that

240
00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:23.795
this is an emergency since it's money to be used for business.

241
00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:25.995
What kind of business is it?

242
00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.495
I think it has something to do

243
00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:29.295
with a shop selling authorized Rena Mizunashi goods

244
00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:30.495
or some mail order goods?

245
00:12:30.495 --> 00:12:32.395
After all, she's popular.

246
00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:35.195
I guess so. Internet shopping is also a trend right now so...

247
00:12:35.195 --> 00:12:38.095
No, wrong.

248
00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:42.095
It's true that it's going around though...

249
00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:50.845
"Anno"

250
00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:53.345
Go... going around?

251
00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:56.845
This brat must think that it's a cold going around or something.

252
00:12:56.845 --> 00:12:58.045
No, I don't.

253
00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:01.545
I just think that the person who called

254
00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:04.745
doesn't want to do what you just mentioned, Sonoko.

255
00:13:04.745 --> 00:13:08.245
Why not? The man on the phone was this lady's son

256
00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:10.745
and a great fan of Rena Mizunashi.

257
00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:13.445
And, he's the one who wants to start a business.

258
00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:15.045
So, it's got to be a Rena Mizunashi goods shop

259
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.945
or an internet shopping site. Don't you think?

260
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:20.445
How can you be so sure that it's not right?

261
00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:23.845
But, I wonder if your son's okay.

262
00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:27.945
If his money was stolen, it has to be taken care of right away.

263
00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:30.645
Yes, that's why I was thinking of going to the bank

264
00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:32.145
to put up the money for now.

265
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:35.245
Oh no, the counters will close soon!

266
00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:37.645
Bye, I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later.

267
00:13:37.645 --> 00:13:38.745
Wait!

268
00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:42.445
Your son caught a cold and cancelled his trip, right?

269
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:44.045
Yes.

270
00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:45.745
Then, isn't something funny?

271
00:13:45.745 --> 00:13:48.545
Why would he be as easygoing as to take a trip

272
00:13:48.545 --> 00:13:50.145
just when he's about to start something new?

273
00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.145
He's going to entertain his business partners.

274
00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:55.145
He was going to take the trip to entertain the people

275
00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:57.345
who he would be doing business with from now.

276
00:13:57.345 --> 00:14:03.045
But, he said his cell phone was broken and changed his number, right?

277
00:14:03.045 --> 00:14:05.345
Huh? So what?

278
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:09.545
He changed his phone number since he got a new cell phone.

279
00:14:09.545 --> 00:14:12.745
I mean, after all, his starting a new business, right?

280
00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:15.145
But, he called his mother yesterday,

281
00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:17.245
to tell her that his number had changed, right?

282
00:14:17.245 --> 00:14:20.445
If he changes his phone number at a busy time like this,

283
00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:24.545
I think that a lot of people will be troubled.

284
00:14:24.545 --> 00:14:26.145
That's true.

285
00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:29.045
He's got to notify all his colleagues and business partners

286
00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:31.645
of his new phone number.

287
00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:35.145
I don't think he would do something like that at a time like this

288
00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.545
unless he had a good reason for doing so.

289
00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:39.145
Then, why?

290
00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:41.545
Maybe he was getting a lot of prank calls?

291
00:14:41.545 --> 00:14:42.845
Come to think of it,

292
00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:46.545
he did mention getting a lot of silent calls before.

293
00:14:46.545 --> 00:14:47.645
What?

294
00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:50.645
He also mentioned that after that his house was broken into too.

295
00:14:50.645 --> 00:14:52.045
Broken into?

296
00:14:52.045 --> 00:14:55.945
I'm sure the burglar called him to verify

297
00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:58.745
whether he was home or not.

298
00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:07.745
Well, he always carries his valuables around with him,

299
00:15:07.745 --> 00:15:11.145
so it seems that nothing was taken back then.

300
00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:13.945
No, I think a wiretap was set up.

301
00:15:13.945 --> 00:15:16.245
Wiretap?

302
00:15:26.145 --> 00:15:28.545
I think that the one who broke in set up a wiretap back then

303
00:15:28.545 --> 00:15:32.945
to check out your son's way of talking and voice.

304
00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:38.345
Of course he knew that your son

305
00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:40.645
would be on a trip this Thursday and Friday,

306
00:15:40.645 --> 00:15:43.045
and the room would be empty too!

307
00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:46.945
But, he said he caught a cold and cancelled the trip.

308
00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.645
He's in his room right now.

309
00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:50.945
Was the man really your son?

310
00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:55.145
Yes, I'm sure. I thought that his voice was hoarse

311
00:15:55.145 --> 00:15:57.045
because of his cold.

312
00:15:57.045 --> 00:15:59.945
The phone number that was displayed was his house phone too.

313
00:15:59.945 --> 00:16:03.345
There was also a dog barking. The dog barks a lot.

314
00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:05.745
It's always barking bow-wow near the phone.

315
00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:07.845
But a dog's bark is even more difficult to distinguish

316
00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:09.845
than the voice of people, is it?

317
00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.745
He probably made a dog with the same kind of voice

318
00:16:11.745 --> 00:16:13.545
bark near the phone...

319
00:16:13.545 --> 00:16:17.045
No, it could've been a tape or CD.

320
00:16:17.045 --> 00:16:20.345
Huh, why would he go all out like that for?

321
00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:24.045
So that you would completely believe that he's your son.

322
00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:25.645
Hey, wait!

323
00:16:25.645 --> 00:16:30.545
Don't tell me it's a bank transfer scam?

324
00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:33.145
Because he's calling under the pretense of your son

325
00:16:33.145 --> 00:16:35.045
and says he needs the money right away.

326
00:16:35.045 --> 00:16:38.445
But, it's just this brat's imagination.

327
00:16:38.445 --> 00:16:41.945
No, he's got a point, though!

328
00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:45.345
If the culprit snuck into your son's room and is calling from there,

329
00:16:45.345 --> 00:16:48.645
the number displayed on your screen would be that of your son's.

330
00:16:48.645 --> 00:16:52.345
Furthermore, if he made you listen to the dog bark in the background...

331
00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:57.545
He would completely deceive you into thinking he is your son.

332
00:16:57.545 --> 00:17:01.345
Then, why did he say, "wrong number" when I called?

333
00:17:01.345 --> 00:17:05.645
You again, I said you have the wrong number!

334
00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:09.345
Maybe that man was waiting for you to call.

335
00:17:09.345 --> 00:17:11.345
Yes, I guess so.

336
00:17:11.345 --> 00:17:14.745
He said to call him as soon as I transferred the money.

337
00:17:14.745 --> 00:17:16.345
I'm sure that he was going to inform the others

338
00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:17.945
that you transferred the money,

339
00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:21.345
so that they could withdraw the money right away and flee.

340
00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:25.445
I guess he didn't have the time to be answering a call

341
00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.945
from somebody else at a time like this,

342
00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:29.145
and still pretend to be your son.

343
00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:32.845
Moreover, he called you just before the closing time of the bank.

344
00:17:32.845 --> 00:17:35.145
The more time you don't give the target to think,

345
00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:38.045
the more successful this scam works.

346
00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:40.245
Of course, he tells you not to talk about it to anyone

347
00:17:40.245 --> 00:17:42.245
to keep you from realizing that it's a scam.

348
00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:43.545
He told you to tell the teller

349
00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:47.045
that it's money to be used for business, for the same reason.

350
00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:48.645
This scam is widespread now,

351
00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:50.045
that unless you say something like that,

352
00:17:50.045 --> 00:17:53.445
the teller will get suspicious too.

353
00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:56.945
I heard all this on the "Afternoon Wide Show" TV program.

354
00:17:56.945 --> 00:18:00.145
You sure remember a lot of things, like usual, don't you, Conan?

355
00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.345
You're just like a housewife who has nothing better than

356
00:18:02.345 --> 00:18:03.845
to watch TV in the afternoon.

357
00:18:03.845 --> 00:18:05.845
Which means that his cell phone breaking

358
00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:09.045
and his phone number being changed are probably all lies.

359
00:18:09.045 --> 00:18:10.745
He said all this so that you won't try to

360
00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:12.745
get a hold of your son who is on a trip.

361
00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:17.445
Yep, so I think you can find out right away if this is a scam or not

362
00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:21.545
by calling your son's original cell phone number!

363
00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:25.445
The number you have called

364
00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:28.645
is either not within service range or switched off

365
00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:30.045
so cannot be connected.

366
00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:33.745
-The number you have called... -Oh my, it won't connect.

367
00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:38.545
Then, does it mean that it's true that his cell phone broke?

368
00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:40.645
Where did your son go?

369
00:18:40.645 --> 00:18:42.845
Sado, in Niigata.

370
00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:45.945
I think he was scheduled to come home by 7:00 tonight.

371
00:18:45.945 --> 00:18:47.445
7:00...

372
00:18:47.445 --> 00:18:51.945
It takes an hour from Sado to Tokyo on the Jet Foil.

373
00:18:51.945 --> 00:18:55.345
Then, it takes 2 hours and a half from Niigata on the Bullet train.

374
00:18:55.345 --> 00:18:57.745
Calculating backwards,

375
00:18:57.745 --> 00:19:01.145
he should be on board the Jet Foil and out at sea.

376
00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:04.645
Sometimes cell phones are out of the service area if you're out at sea.

377
00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:07.745
So, the culprit had all that figured out too.

378
00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.245
I've got less than ten minutes.

379
00:19:11.245 --> 00:19:13.845
I've got to go to the bank for sure this time!

380
00:19:13.845 --> 00:19:15.545
No, don't go, Ma'am!

381
00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:17.245
You're persistent, aren't you?

382
00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:19.945
My son's saying that if he can't get hold of 10 million yen by today,

383
00:19:19.945 --> 00:19:21.445
he's going to have to borrow it from loan sharks.

384
00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:25.445
If he does so, then there'll be no turning back.

385
00:19:30.645 --> 00:19:33.545
"Beika Central Bank"

386
00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:42.445
What? You couldn't transfer the money?

387
00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:44.545
No, because I had some sudden guests

388
00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:46.045
and couldn't get to it right away.

389
00:19:46.045 --> 00:19:47.345
I'm really sorry.

390
00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:50.045
I told you to hurry it up.

391
00:19:50.045 --> 00:19:53.345
You should've left right away after my call.

392
00:19:53.345 --> 00:19:54.445
But, you did say that

393
00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:56.945
you were going to the loan shark for the cash,

394
00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.945
so I guess all you have to do is come up with the money for today

395
00:19:58.945 --> 00:20:00.545
for the moment, right?

396
00:20:00.545 --> 00:20:02.745
Yeah, I guess so.

397
00:20:05.145 --> 00:20:08.245
Will my sugar-bowl savings be able to cover for the time being then?

398
00:20:08.245 --> 00:20:10.645
Sugar-bowl savings? How much?

399
00:20:10.645 --> 00:20:12.745
I was saving up just in case, for times like this.

400
00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:14.445
I've got about 2 million yen.

401
00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:17.845
I sent you the card together with the pass code yesterday

402
00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:21.445
so that you can withdraw the money, so it should already be there.

403
00:20:21.445 --> 00:20:23.045
Won't that do?

404
00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:25.845
Yeah, I guess I can make do for the time being.

405
00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:29.145
I'll go withdraw the cash right now.

406
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.645
I'm sorry I yelled at you, Mom.

407
00:20:42.645 --> 00:20:44.845
Who are you?

408
00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.845
Well... you see.

409
00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:49.345
Darn it! Move it!

410
00:21:09.445 --> 00:21:16.045
So, the culprit of the bank transfer scam was arrested right away.

411
00:21:16.045 --> 00:21:18.545
His accomplice who was waiting for the transfer at the bank

412
00:21:18.545 --> 00:21:20.045
was also arrested,

413
00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.245
and this alleged bank transfer scam was prevented

414
00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:24.545
before any damage was done.

415
00:21:24.545 --> 00:21:27.145
In other words, the simplest and most effective method

416
00:21:27.145 --> 00:21:29.545
of not being taken in by such scams

417
00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:31.945
is to not make rash decisions alone.

418
00:21:31.945 --> 00:21:34.745
And, though it doesn't matter who, talk about it to somebody!

419
00:21:34.745 --> 00:21:37.145
By putting the situation into words and explaining,

420
00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:38.645
you can organize the situation

421
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:41.645
and take in the situation more calmly.

422
00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:44.345
This way, if they or the person they discuss with

423
00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:46.145
are even a little bit suspicious...

424
00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:48.645
This kind of scam can be prevented.

425
00:21:59.045 --> 00:22:01.145
Mom.

426
00:22:02.245 --> 00:22:04.945
What? You were targeted by a bank transfer scam!

427
00:22:04.945 --> 00:22:06.745
You, mom!

428
00:22:06.745 --> 00:22:10.245
Yes. But, these children kept me from being deceived.

429
00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:12.945
It's been a long time. I'm Ran Mouri.

430
00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:14.645
Hi Aina, long time no see.

431
00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:18.545
Oh, I see, you're Mr. Mouri's...

432
00:22:19.545 --> 00:22:22.045
But, what brings you here?

433
00:22:22.045 --> 00:22:24.345
We came to see you.

434
00:22:24.345 --> 00:22:27.845
We have a favor to ask you, sir.

435
00:22:27.845 --> 00:22:28.945
This person.

436
00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:32.345
We want you to take a look at Rena Mizunashi's picture.

437
00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:08.145
Are Eisuke Hondo's older sister

438
00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:11.045
and Rena Mizunashi the same person?

439
00:24:11.045 --> 00:24:13.445
It turns out that Eisuke emphatically denied this fact

440
00:24:13.445 --> 00:24:16.345
because of the difference in their blood type.

441
00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:18.545
Rena Mizunashi's blood type is AB,

442
00:24:18.545 --> 00:24:20.045
Eisuke who says that he once had blood transfusion from his sister,

443
00:24:20.045 --> 00:24:22.745
whose blood type is O.

444
00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:25.845
When we arrive at a big mansion in order to confirm the truth,

445
00:24:25.845 --> 00:24:28.345
we encounter a mystery of a new incident.

446
00:24:30.045 --> 00:24:32.145
Next on Detective Conan,

447
00:24:32.145 --> 00:24:35.845
"Red and Black Crash: Kin"

448
00:24:51.545 --> 00:24:53.745
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:53.745 --> 00:24:56.045
Blood transfusion.

450
00:24:56.045 --> 00:24:57.545
Ran, what blood type are you?

451
00:24:57.545 --> 00:24:58.845
The same as Shinichi's.

452
00:24:58.845 --> 00:25:00.845
Me too... I mean, of course.
