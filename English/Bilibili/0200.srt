1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,240
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,140
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,940
Kogoro the suspect is in a real pinch.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,140
Only a certain person can save him.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,399
The three of us are staying in a hotel here in Karuizawa,

9
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,399
where by mere chance, we run into Eri Kisaki who is also here

10
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,099
with a group of her lawyer colleagues.

11
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,299
Later that night,

12
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,599
Kogoro becomes drunk and when he doesn't return to his room,

13
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,999
we go looking for him, discover the body of fellow lawyer,

14
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,199
Ritsuko Usui in her locked room.

15
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,099
On top of that, we find Kogoro asleep in that room.

16
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:23,299
Naturally, Kogoro is considered the prime suspect

17
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,099
and he is taken to the station for questioning.

18
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:28,699
We are left behind and...

19
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,999
Mom, are you saying the reason you didn't go with dad to the station

20
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,699
was you wanted to check things out here.

21
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,099
Of course, silly.

22
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,599
I've known him much longer than you.

23
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,599
Sure, I was angry at first but I know better than anyone

24
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,899
that he isn't capable of murder.

25
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:51,899
"Kogoro Mouri The Suspect (Part 2)"

26
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,799
"I'm very sorry, please tell him I'll repay the money,"

27
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,099
that sounds strange.

28
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,899
It seems hard to believe

29
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:02,499
but it sounds like there was a money matter between the two lawyers.

30
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:07,199
I know for a fact Miss Usui, the victim and Mr. Hayashi have never met.

31
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,099
Besides, I hadn't even told her about him yet,

32
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,999
so they couldn't possibly have been making a money deal.

33
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,599
I didn't think so either.

34
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,299
And Mr. Hayashi, who would be working with her

35
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,499
wanted to contact her as soon as possible.

36
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:27,399
So he asked Mr. Shiozawa, one of her colleagues

37
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,299
where she could be reached and called her here.

38
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,499
And judging from the memo we found in the waste basket

39
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,199
and the bell boy's statement,

40
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,299
it is certain they were going to meet the next day at 2 o'clock.

41
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,799
But how do you explain the note on the door?

42
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:44,299
I remember you.

43
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,099
I'm positive you were with Miss Yukiko

44
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,099
when I was working on another case in the past.

45
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:00,099
I knew I'd seen this guy somewhere before.

46
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,899
He's that incompetent officer with the Gunma Prefectural Police.

47
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,799
Oh, that...

48
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,699
What are you doing here, Karuizawa is in Nagano prefecture, isn't it?

49
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,699
Yes, but this place is right on the borderline

50
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,499
and it's in our jurisdiction.

51
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:17,699
So, you've met Yukiko and this boy before?

52
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,199
Yes, I think her husband came later though.

53
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,199
They certainly caused a lot of trouble,

54
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,999
disrupting our investigation and all.

55
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,599
Especially this kid.

56
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:33,499
That grouchy man was guilty, wasn't he?

57
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,799
Yeah, I guess.

58
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,599
Officer Yamamura.

59
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,099
Are you sure about that?

60
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,799
Madam, I regret saying this,

61
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:54,499
but it seems your husband is guilty.

62
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,799
Your husband's fingerprints were on the telephone cord

63
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,699
which was the murder weapon!

64
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:02,699
And on top of that,

65
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,699
we have witnesses from the bar stating that your husband was drunk

66
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,399
and making advances to Miss Usui.

67
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,999
I'm almost positive your husband is the murderer!

68
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,399
Now wait just a minute, weren't you listening?

69
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,899
I told you there were no marks from the cord on my husband's hands.

70
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,499
He's a top notch private detective.

71
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,599
In other words, he's a crime specialist.

72
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,599
He'd know how to avoid getting marks on his hands.

73
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:29,299
But just because he was drunk and having a fight?

74
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:33,299
The real motive though, is probably his job.

75
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,299
He sees mutilated bodies nearly every day

76
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:41,299
and he snapped, he decided he wanted to commit a murder too.

77
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,799
That's scary.

78
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,699
This is bad.

79
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,599
If we let this dummy handle the case,

80
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,699
he'll get Kogoro convicted for real.

81
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,899
Listen. I found something weird by the door.

82
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,099
See, here, here.

83
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,099
Hey?

84
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:02,899
If you're talking about the thread,

85
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,499
I gave it to the officers from the crime lab.

86
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,799
Thread?

87
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,099
Yes.

88
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,899
I found it.

89
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,499
It was about three centimeters long with one end tied.

90
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,799
It was on the floor along with a piece of the door chain

91
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:20,299
which probably flew off when the door was forced open.

92
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:23,499
Then did you take a good look at that piece of chain?

93
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,099
Yes, I did.

94
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:29,399
I saw a strange mark on it.

95
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:31,999
Then...

96
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,399
That's right.

97
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,099
I'm pretty sure I figured out the trick

98
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,099
as to how the room was locked, but...

99
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,399
Trick?

100
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,299
But...

101
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,999
I know, proof.

102
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,899
We know why the killer used the telephone cord to commit the murder,

103
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,899
and why Kogoro's phone was left by the door,

104
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,499
and even why the sign was left on the door,

105
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,899
we even know who the killer is

106
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,899
but there's no proof.

107
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,399
Do you have that MD player I bought for you?

108
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,599
Right here, but...

109
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,799
Can I borrow it?

110
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,299
I can't think straight unless I listen to music.

111
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:13,299
What I can't figure out is that strange note on the door.

112
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,699
Hey?

113
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,299
There's no music on this disk.

114
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:19,299
You're kidding.

115
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:21,699
Wait. You're pressing the record button.

116
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:22,699
Oh no.

117
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,299
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,399
The MD player we have in the office is only used for recording,

119
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,299
I pressed it without thinking.

120
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,899
Good grief.

121
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,499
Without thinking?

122
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,599
Wait a minute.

123
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,599
I'm pretty sure it was on the desk.

124
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,499
I'm pretty sure. Yes, I'm sure.

125
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,599
I see, so that's why that person left that note.

126
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,999
No. You mustn't do that.

127
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,399
You shouldn't stand on chairs with your shoes on.

128
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,099
But I'm hungry.

129
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,999
Sometimes you act like such an adult

130
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,699
but sometimes you're such a little kid.

131
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,399
I can't help it, I'm starving.

132
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,999
All right.

133
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,799
I'll order you something from room service later.

134
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,299
What you just said?

135
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:23,699
Saku.

136
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,699
How did it go? How is he doing at the station?

137
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,999
Actually, it seems Mr. Mouri was so drunk,

138
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,199
he doesn't know why he was in her room

139
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:40,199
even the police can't believe he's the suspect

140
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,899
so they're in a state of confusion too.

141
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,599
I see.

142
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,399
Ms. Kisaki, I hate to say this

143
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,799
but your husband is the only one who could've done it.

144
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,299
Miss Usui's room was locked from the inside.

145
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,099
And Mr. Mouri was asleep in her bed.

146
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:00,099
There's the issue of how he killed her.

147
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,099
It would be considered accidental death

148
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,699
if she died as a result of say, hitting her head against something

149
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:05,999
when he pushed her while he was in a drunken stupor,

150
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,999
but she was strangled to death with a telephone cord.

151
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,999
That's first degree murder.

152
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:14,899
I agree, he stands to face a minimum sentence of 10 years

153
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,199
if he's charged with murder and rape,

154
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,399
at worst, it'll be a life sentence

155
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,599
and there's always the possibility of the death penalty.

156
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,799
Mom, how can you say that?

157
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,399
Didn't you just say, someone else did it?

158
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,599
Oh that... I guess I was wrong after all.

159
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,499
By the way, Ms. Kisaki, did you want to ask me something?

160
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,899
Yes, there's was something I just couldn't figure out

161
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,899
so I thought I'd get your opinion.

162
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,699
Your specialty is criminal law, isn't it?

163
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:47,899
So I thought you'd know more about these things.

164
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,899
Come on, let's go.

165
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,899
Ms. Kisaki.

166
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,699
Mom!

167
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,999
What do think will happen to that trial?

168
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,899
You know the case she was working on,

169
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,699
the one dealing with that pollution problem.

170
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:10,099
Do you think I should take over that case then?

171
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,699
But unlike Ritsuko, the issue's not what I specialize in,

172
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,899
so at best, I'd probably just get both parties to settle out of court.

173
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,299
It's my phone.

174
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,499
Sorry, but you could you go on ahead to her room.

175
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,299
Sure.

176
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:27,099
Let's see,

177
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,899
where was her room?

178
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,199
Good grief.

179
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,699
It's Mr. Saku.

180
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,299
Hey, are you all alone, kid?

181
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,699
The police are all gone.

182
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,799
What are you doing here?

183
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:51,999
Ms. Kisaki said she wanted to talk to me.

184
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,099
I bet it's about that short piece of thread

185
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,499
and we found on the floor by the door

186
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,799
along with a part of the door chain.

187
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,499
I heard her talking.

188
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,799
She said that you could use that thread from the outside

189
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,599
to make it look like the door was locked.

190
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,699
That's ridiculous.

191
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:11,999
I can verify that the chain was fastened securely,

192
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,899
that's why I had to break the door down to get in.

193
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,699
How can you lock the door with such a short piece of thread?

194
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,799
What is the chain was cut from the very beginning?

195
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:31,099
What if the thread was holding the loose ends of the chain together?

196
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:35,799
And what if the knot and the parts of the chain that had been removed

197
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,999
were put on the floor in a spot that when the door was opened,

198
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,899
it would be in a blind spot.

199
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,499
Well?

200
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,799
Yes, and after that,

201
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,299
when the door is opened with force,

202
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,299
the thread will break, the chain separates

203
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,899
and all of us there will have the illusion,

204
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,599
that the door had been chained from the inside.

205
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,699
Isn't that right, Saku?

206
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:16,229
You did it, didn't you, Saku?

207
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,529
I don't know what you're talking about.

208
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,529
Mr. Mouri was asleep in the room,

209
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,829
if he'd gotten up and taken the chain off,

210
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,429
the whole plan would be blown.

211
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:30,229
That's why you used the telephone cord to strangle her,

212
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,729
so the phone wouldn't ring

213
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,029
and you took my husband's phone away from the bedside

214
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,629
and put it near the door

215
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,929
then you put the "Do Not Disturb" sign out

216
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,629
so no one would ring the door bell, isn't that right?

217
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:47,029
All that so my husband wouldn't get up.

218
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,829
But then I'm sure you put his cellular near the door

219
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:52,229
so that we could hear it ring from the hall,

220
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,329
that way we'd know he was inside,

221
00:12:55,329 --> 00:13:00,029
you knew that would make us get the master key to get inside.

222
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,729
If I hadn't called his phone then,

223
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,229
you would have, I'm sure of it.

224
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,129
Nice going, Ms. Kisaki.

225
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,129
What you say makes sense.

226
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,729
But it would be wiser for you not to stand up in Mr. Mouri's defense

227
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,129
and charge me for it.

228
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,029
After all, you have no proof I did it

229
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,729
and your prefect record would be marred,

230
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,229
you wouldn't want that, would you?

231
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:24,629
You fool, the only reason I have a perfect record

232
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,929
is because I've had a streak of good luck.

233
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,429
It's about time it ended anyway, then at least the pressure would be off.

234
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:33,529
Unfortunately though, it seems my luck is still strong.

235
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:36,729
Want to know why? It's because you're confessing,

236
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:40,229
it started the moment you stepped inside this room.

237
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,229
I'm surprised you knew this was her room.

238
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:47,929
Why shouldn't I?

239
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:51,329
There's the hayashi rice outside the door.

240
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:56,429
Oh my, how did you know about the hayashi rice?

241
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,129
Well...

242
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,129
That's right.

243
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:06,229
The door bell probably rang while you were still in the room

244
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,229
working on the door chain after killing Ritsuko.

245
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,329
When you looked through the view hole,

246
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,629
you saw the bell boy standing there,

247
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,029
and saw the memo on the desk, "Hayashi 2"

248
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,329
that's why you got so mad you tore the memo up

249
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,329
and threw it into the trash, right?

250
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:24,029
You were upset that she'd ordered room service at a time like that.

251
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,729
Then to prevent the bell boy from ringing the door bell again

252
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,429
when he returned,

253
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,729
you wrote a note inferring that the hayashi rice should be taken back

254
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,729
but you would pay for them,

255
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:37,329
then you taped the note on the sign and hung it on the door knob.

256
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,429
Unless you did those things,

257
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:42,029
there's no way for you to know about the hayashi rice.

258
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,829
It was just coincidence that I saw them.

259
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,429
I saw the bell boy standing in front of her room

260
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:49,329
holding the plates and he looked upset.

261
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,429
That's how I knew this was her room.

262
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,829
I hate to tell you this.

263
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:59,329
But that memo you saw meant she was to meet Mr. Hayashi at 2 o'clock.

264
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,129
You saw the memo on the desk along with the open room service menu

265
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:10,629
and you jumped to the conclusion that she meant hayashi rice.

266
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:15,629
Did I say hayashi rice? I meant to say...

267
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:18,029
I knew this was her room because I looked at the room number.

268
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,229
Oh my, haven't you noticed?

269
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,629
See...

270
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:27,329
the door chain in this room isn't cut, is it?

271
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,529
We made a sudden request for the hotel to let us use this room,

272
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,629
her actual room is two doors down,

273
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:39,429
which means...

274
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:43,229
you had absolutely no reason to enter this room,

275
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,329
unless you were the murderer.

276
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,629
Please forgive me for setting this trap

277
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,329
but when I realized you were the killer,

278
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:59,029
I knew I had to be conniving or you'd never fall for it.

279
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,729
I think I understand for the first time.

280
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,429
How the prosecutors must feel going against you in court

281
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:06,829
but how are you going to convince the prosecution?

282
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:11,129
You're the only one that saw me come into this room

283
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,629
and being a part of Mr. Mouri's family,

284
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:17,229
your testimony wouldn't count.

285
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:20,029
But I'm not the only witness.

286
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,229
You're not talking about this kid, are you?

287
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,229
And I'm not the only one either.

288
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:28,629
Isn't that right, officers?

289
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,129
That's right, we saw everything.

290
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,129
Right through the view hole in the room across the hall.

291
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,029
Isn't that right, men?

292
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,129
-Yes, we got a good look! -Yes, we got a good look!

293
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:44,129
-A real good look. -A real good look.

294
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,229
And we have everything on video tape too.

295
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,929
I see.

296
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:54,629
But it was all this little guy's idea.

297
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:00,629
Now tell me, was the case she was working on your motive for killing her?

298
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,429
Yes, the village that suffered from the pollution

299
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,229
is where I grew up.

300
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:08,829
I really wanted them to win the case.

301
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,329
Actually, I intended to drug her in the doorway and after she was asleep,

302
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,329
I was going to lock the room up

303
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,229
and make it look like she committed suicide

304
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:20,029
but Mr. Mouri was asleep in the room

305
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,329
and no one would believe she would commit suicide

306
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,729
after inviting a man into her room and then ordering room service

307
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:32,029
so I decided to strangle her instead and frame Mr. Mouri.

308
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:34,929
It would have given the judge a bad impression

309
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,029
if the villagers killed the lawyer

310
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,429
so they could win the trial, wouldn't it?

311
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:43,229
I intended to settle the case out of court quickly

312
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,129
then turn myself in.

313
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,929
But even if you turned yourself in,

314
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,929
unless there's evidence to prove you did it.

315
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,829
But I do...

316
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,929
It's that weird shaped mark left by the pliers you used

317
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,829
on the chain, isn't it?

318
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:59,829
There's only one pair of pliers in the world that leave that mark,

319
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,029
you were going to take that to police, weren't you?

320
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,929
Yes.

321
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,929
Ritsuko only took that case because it was assigned to her,

322
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,829
you didn't have to kill her.

323
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,229
I would never have done it

324
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,929
if she had taken the case to support her livelihood

325
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,729
or because she considered it her job

326
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,329
but when I learned she was deliberately

327
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:24,329
making things hard for the villagers and taking the case to court

328
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:25,929
only so she could outdo you and gain recognition,

329
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,829
well, I just couldn't let her get away with it.

330
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,929
To outdo me?

331
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,629
Yes,

332
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:34,629
and I think she took Mr. Mouri up to her room

333
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,229
for that very same reason.

334
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:39,129
I don't believe it, it can't be true.

335
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:40,829
As lawyers, our job is to trust our clients

336
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,629
and defend them as best as we can,

337
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,429
but you're too trusting.

338
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,029
There's a hidden side to every human being.

339
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,629
To be perfectly honest,

340
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,229
I was one of the men who was trying to get you.

341
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,629
Thank you.

342
00:18:56,629 --> 00:19:00,229
But flattery's not going to make me take your case.

343
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,129
Oh, sorry.

344
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,629
Boy, I wished you could've seen it.

345
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,629
Your wife's reconstruction of the crime was brilliant.

346
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,929
She's Sleeping Kogoro's wife, no doubt about it.

347
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,129
The Queen of the court room.

348
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:16,429
I got goose bumps watching her work.

349
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,529
And what were you doing while she was doing all the work?

350
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,829
I followed her instructions

351
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,529
and put the hayashi rice where it was supposed to go

352
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,429
and then I went to the room across the hall and waited as I was told.

353
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:27,929
When I saw them coming down the hall,

354
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,329
I called your wife on her cellular,

355
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:33,129
and then and then, when the suspect entered the staged room,

356
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:36,729
fan fare went off in my head.

357
00:19:36,729 --> 00:19:39,829
Boy, I'm glad I became a police officer.

358
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,229
And then? So where is she now?

359
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,929
Over there, see.

360
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,529
At that table over there.

361
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,429
It's dad.

362
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,129
We're in luck. Now we can get some breakfast.

363
00:19:58,829 --> 00:19:59,829
Hold it.

364
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:11,329
Don't they look friendly, this looks promising.

365
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:13,129
I really appreciated it, Eri.

366
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,729
I had faith in you.

367
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,929
I knew you would prove I was innocent.

368
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:24,229
And by the way, I'm kind of getting tired of Ran's cooking.

369
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:28,229
I guess I sort of miss your rather strange cuisine,

370
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:29,829
what I mean is...

371
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,829
would you mind coming home now.

372
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:37,829
I can't take it anymore.

373
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:46,129
Since today's our wedding anniversary.

374
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,529
I thought it'd be a good time to get back together...

375
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,129
Hey, did you hear me?

376
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,229
What is it?

377
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:02,929
Nothing.

378
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,129
Dad, mom!

379
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:10,129
Quick, tell me what you were talking about?

380
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:13,429
I was just telling her that for a first rate lawyer,

381
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:15,229
she sure was working slow,

382
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,729
getting her dear husband cleared of the charges.

383
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,429
Did you say "dear" husband,

384
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,729
it should be "darn" husband, shouldn't it?

385
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:24,229
What did you say?

386
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:25,729
Well, I guess you've learned your lesson,

387
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:29,429
you should go easy on the liquor, you moustached, lecher!

388
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,229
-Why you, you... -Dad!

389
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:35,429
Ran, I nearly forgot.

390
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,529
I'm going to hang on to this disk.

391
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,529
I got to like this song.

392
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,729
Well, I'll be seeing you.

393
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:48,129
Mom!

394
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:50,129
Don't you ever show your face again!

395
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:53,029
For goodness sakes, dad, you're a fool, a fool!

396
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,529
"Kisaki's Office"

397
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:22,729
What I mean is...

398
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:27,329
would you mind coming home now.

399
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:29,229
I can't take it anymore.

400
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:33,929
Since today's our wedding anniversary.

401
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,529
I thought it'd be a good time to get back together...

402
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:39,729
What I mean is...

403
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:43,529
would you mind coming home now.

404
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,829
Not quite yet!

405
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:48,429
Saying something like this isn't going to get you off the hook.

406
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,529
Am I getting a cold?

407
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,229
I doubt it.

408
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:02,329
"Next Episode"

409
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:07,129
Someone probably poisoned the tea in this bottle.

410
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:10,129
Hey! What's going on in this village?

411
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,929
What happened in this village seven years ago?

412
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:22,629
What on earth is going on?

413
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,429
Next Conan,

414
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,550
"The 10th Passenger (Part 1)"

415
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,406
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:33,506
"Plastic bottle"

417
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,906
A nostalgic bonnet bus appears in the next episode.

418
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,706
Oh, that delicious meat tied up with string.

419
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:38,506
That's a boneless ham.
