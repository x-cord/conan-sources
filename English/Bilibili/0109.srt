1
00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:04.538
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.688
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:09.988
Today's case is a suspicious car!
Be careful on the road!

4
00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:11.658
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:13.908
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:16.368
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.531
"The Great Detective League Pursuit Case."

8
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:07.881
Ayumi-chan! Mitsuhiko!
Genta! Here we go!

9
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:09.711
Roger, Conan-kun!

10
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.141
You can count on us!

11
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.011
Let's do this thing!

12
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:24.441
Take this!

13
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.571
Now!

14
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:30.701
W-What the...

15
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:33.491
Let me down! Let me down from here!

16
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:35.281
The Junior Detective League...

17
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:37.291
...is victorious!

18
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.871
We'll take on any case!

19
00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:45.191
We'll investigate any case!

20
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:46.501
And solve any case!

21
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:50.261
Hey, now.... you're bragging
a little too much...

22
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:53.341
You can count on the
Junior Detective League!

23
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.971
Four Schoolchildren Catch Jewel Thief

24
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.531
Thanks for the food!

25
00:03:12.531 --> 00:03:18.991
Geez, you guys ate a ton!
Don't any of you know what constraint is?!

26
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:24.291
Go treat the kiddos to
a meal or something, Mori-kun!

27
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.751
Me?!

28
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:32.171
Bah. There goes all my
spending money for this month.

29
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.681
You're amazing! He was
wanted for fifty different robberies!

30
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.521
Conan-kun found him! He seemed
suspicious in the jewelry shop!

31
00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:44.481
It was just sheer luck, though.

32
00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:46.581
Now we're gonna get even more clients!

33
00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:49.151
Yeah! We should get our own office!

34
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.461
Hey! A car's coming!

35
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:06.081
Ayumi-chan!

36
00:04:06.081 --> 00:04:06.961
Damn!

37
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.921
"Shinjuku 33, NA 33-96!"

38
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:12.131
A hit-and-run!

39
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:16.681
Ran! You stay here! I'm going to
get the police and an ambulance!

40
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:18.181
Look after her, Ran-neechan!

41
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:23.251
Don't say a word, Conan!

42
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.641
We can't leave this entirely to the police!

43
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:28.901
Okay! Hold on tight!

44
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.871
It turned!

45
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:41.951
We're gonna lose it if we don't speed up!

46
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.461
I know!

47
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.211
There's the car!

48
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:52.801
I thought we lost it! Lucky!

49
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.141
It's stopped again!

50
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:10.061
It must have engine trouble!

51
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:12.171
Talk about lucky!

52
00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:17.031
It stops at every turn...
Almost as if it's waiting for us!

53
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:21.251
There it goes!

54
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:24.371
Hey! What're you
doing, Conan?! Go faster!

55
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.621
I don't see the car...

56
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:41.331
Did it finally lose us?

57
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:42.291
Look for it!

58
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.641
Right!

59
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.561
Hey! Is it hidden in here?!

60
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:52.311
No, there's no place for it.

61
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.421
Ishikura Industries
Plus, it looks like this factory is closed today.

62
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.821
Let's check around back!
Ishikura Industries

63
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:05.041
What a bad road!
There's no pavement here!

64
00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:12.961
There are stairs this way.
Which means...!

65
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:14.671
I don't see anything.

66
00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:17.591
There's a cigarette shop!
Let's ask there!

67
00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:24.811
Lady! Did a red car
just pass by here?!

68
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.351
I'm not sure. A couple
cars did pass by, but...

69
00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:30.971
It's a two-door!

70
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:32.771
And a sports car!

71
00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:35.891
I don't know anything about cars...

72
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:39.011
Hello?

73
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:43.031
Oh, it's you! How're you doing?

74
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.271
Hey, we've been
here three minutes now.

75
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:48.181
The person is
long gone by now...

76
00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:50.221
Damn!

77
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.001
Look there!

78
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.211
A red car! That's it!

79
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:57.891
Its engine stalled again!
We're lucky!

80
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:03.521
No! It's different from before!
It wasn't there earlier!

81
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.221
Did it back up or something?!
What for?!

82
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.611
We got it this time!

83
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:12.941
There's no escape!

84
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:25.411
Alright! We got it! Just a little more!

85
00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.221
Oww...

86
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:35.381
Beika Local Police Station

87
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:37.561
T-This is...

88
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:38.841
...a police station...

89
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:47.011
Officer, please arrest me.
I committed a hit-and-run.

90
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:49.721
H-He's turning himself in?

91
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:52.931
Beika Central Hospital

92
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.101
He tried to run away after he hit you,

93
00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:00.361
but he decided to turn
himself in after the guilt got to him.

94
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:02.641
Geez! How anti-climatic!

95
00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:06.601
I wanted the Junior Detective
League to use more of its might!

96
00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:08.081
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

97
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:10.351
Oh, nothing.

98
00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:12.451
So, how is Ayumi?

99
00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:15.681
She only got some scratches, thankfully.

100
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.791
They said she doesn't
need to be hospitalized.

101
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.571
Then you can go home today!

102
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.761
That's great news!

103
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:28.971
No, it isn't. I lost the Detective
League badge Conan-kun gave me.

104
00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:32.221
You dropped it when you were hit?

105
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:35.351
The policeman said they didn't see it.

106
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:38.651
Don't worry! I can have
the Doc make another one!

107
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:43.111
Really?! I'm so happy!
That's why I like you, Conan-kun!

108
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:46.021
That's not fair, Conan.

109
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:48.451
Buying her love with objects...
You coward!

110
00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:50.781
Oh, geez...

111
00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:56.181
Hey, you kids! Come with
me to the factory on 4th Street!

112
00:08:56.181 --> 00:08:57.751
The inspector is waiting!

113
00:08:58.101 --> 00:09:01.561
The factory on 4th Street?
That's the place we passed by earlier.

114
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.211
Did something happen?

115
00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:08.051
Someone died there.
It was apparently a murder.

116
00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:17.651
Listen! You kids stay here!

117
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.591
Inspector.

118
00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:22.561
Oh, you came!

119
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.941
Getting right to the point,
here's the situation.

120
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:25.851
President of Ishikura Industries, Ishikura Hisashi (50)

121
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:28.181
The victim was the president of this factory,
President of Ishikura Industries, Ishikura Hisashi (50)

122
00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:30.411
lshikura Hisashi-san, age 50.
President of Ishikura Industries, Ishikura Hisashi (50)

123
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:33.371
This was a robbery.

124
00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:39.081
Yes, we're investigating
it as a robbery murder.

125
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.931
The factory is closed today,

126
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:45.511
but Ishikura-san was apparently
here alone, checking the products.

127
00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:50.011
There are tape marks on
his mouth and wrist.

128
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:53.021
Meaning he was strangled.

129
00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:57.811
But why bother
removing the tape? The killer--

130
00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:58.731
Oww! Oww!

131
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.351
Quit scampering around the scene!

132
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.691
I'm sorry!

133
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:10.911
The back door is diagonal
from the cigarette lady's shop...

134
00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:14.561
We'll have to wait
for the autopsy for details,

135
00:10:14.561 --> 00:10:17.871
but he died approximately an hour ago.

136
00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:21.851
That's the same time we passed by here!

137
00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:23.081
No question about it!

138
00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:24.721
I thought so!

139
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:27.681
Did you see anyone suspicious then?!

140
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:30.051
No, not really...

141
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:33.681
We were focused on
following the hit-and-run man...

142
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:36.011
Oh! That's him!

143
00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:39.541
See?! The guy in
the back, near the middle!

144
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:44.191
Oh! He's the one who hit Ayumi-chan!

145
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:45.811
What now?!

146
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.831
Are you sure?!

147
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:48.031
We're certain of it!

148
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.811
I bet he did this murder, too!

149
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:53.491
Yeah, right! It's just coincidence!

150
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:55.101
Obviously!

151
00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:58.661
Who'd commit a robbery murder
while running from a hit-and-run?!

152
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:01.121
Beika Police Department

153
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:01.681
Former Ishikura Ind., Employee Shishido Kenichi (35)

154
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.311
The children started chasing me,
Former Ishikura Ind., Employee Shishido Kenichi (35)

155
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:08.091
and my car stalled on the curve
a little ways behind the factory.
Former Ishikura Ind., Employee Shishido Kenichi (35)

156
00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:16.141
I never stopped the car behind
the factory, nor did I murder anyone.

157
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.511
It's just coincidence...

158
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:24.351
He used to work at that factory,
and was let go due to his misconduct.

159
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.191
Inspector! You don't think...

160
00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:28.271
He really did do it?!

161
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.721
He couldn't have, Genta-kun!

162
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:31.811
Why's that?

163
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:35.031
We were in front of the
factory when it happened!

164
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:37.101
But, Inspector!

165
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:41.251
He could've used the back door
while he was out of the kids' sight!

166
00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:47.651
Yes, but we spoke with the cigarette
shop lady behind the factory.

167
00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:54.181
No cars stopped near here.
Not behind the factory or on the street.

168
00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:58.431
Her shop is right across from the factory's back entrance.
Location of car
Ishikura Industries

169
00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:00.681
Her testimony can be trusted.
Cigarette shop
Conan and friends

170
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.101
Which would mean it
really was just coincidence...

171
00:12:06.471 --> 00:12:11.101
No! There's another
side to these two incidents!

172
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:15.031
Something big that we haven't noticed yet!

173
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:20.201
Is there still something else, Conan?

174
00:12:20.601 --> 00:12:24.211
Come on, let's go visit
Ayumi-chan!

175
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.461
You guys go on ahead.

176
00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:32.601
No! The Junior Detective League
must always work as a team!

177
00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:36.471
But I need juice first. I'm thirsty.

178
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:41.391
There's some juice over there!
By the cigarette shop!

179
00:12:46.521 --> 00:12:51.071
Oh, Wataru did?
He was such a studious boy, too...

180
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:53.491
Wait a minute!

181
00:12:54.351 --> 00:12:56.181
Say, lady!

182
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:59.451
When the factory incident happened,
did anyone call you by mistake?

183
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:05.121
Oh, now that you mention it,
there had been two wrong numbers...

184
00:13:05.721 --> 00:13:09.831
Just as I thought!
As I recall, that alleyway had--

185
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:12.551
Thanks, lady! Bye!

186
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:18.471
What's going on, Conan?

187
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:20.931
Genta! Lift me up on your shoulders!

188
00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:22.221
Lift you up?

189
00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:26.981
Is there something in there?

190
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.691
I knew it!

191
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.481
It's just as I thought!

192
00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:34.791
What's that?!

193
00:13:36.021 --> 00:13:39.121
Aha! That's where it is!

194
00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:50.813
Say what?! Shishido Kenichi,
the hit-and-run guy?!

195
00:13:50.813 --> 00:13:52.593
Alright! Got it, Mori-kun!

196
00:13:52.893 --> 00:13:54.223
Okay! Now for the old guy!

197
00:13:57.603 --> 00:14:00.183
Mori-kun? This is Megure.

198
00:14:00.183 --> 00:14:03.393
Could you hurry down
to the factory on 4th Street?

199
00:14:06.603 --> 00:14:08.063
Good work.

200
00:14:11.353 --> 00:14:13.023
Where are you, Inspector?

201
00:14:13.683 --> 00:14:15.023
We've been expecting you!

202
00:14:15.023 --> 00:14:19.273
H-Hey, you! What are you doing here?!

203
00:14:19.273 --> 00:14:21.683
Inspector Megure will be here shortly!

204
00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:24.663
Please wait here until then!

205
00:14:25.183 --> 00:14:28.043
Oh, you can be considerate!
Don't mind if I do...

206
00:14:31.313 --> 00:14:37.463
I wish I could've
had at least one sip first...

207
00:14:39.563 --> 00:14:41.683
It's just like Conan said...

208
00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:45.513
He became Sleeping Kogoro
the instant he entered the crime scene!

209
00:14:45.773 --> 00:14:49.183
Didn't even notice we just
filled an empty can with water!

210
00:14:50.353 --> 00:14:52.353
Hey, Conan! Where are you?

211
00:14:52.353 --> 00:14:54.443
What do we do next?

212
00:14:55.183 --> 00:14:58.903
Conan told me everything.
I'll handle things from here.

213
00:15:00.183 --> 00:15:01.603
You can't be serious, old guy!

214
00:15:01.603 --> 00:15:06.353
Don't worry. I've made sure
you'll be in the spotlight, too.

215
00:15:06.353 --> 00:15:07.723
Alright!

216
00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:09.623
Okay, then!
Okay, then!

217
00:15:11.683 --> 00:15:13.463
I brought him, Mori-kun.

218
00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:15.473
What is this about?

219
00:15:15.473 --> 00:15:18.673
Shishido-san can answer that.

220
00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:21.343
How is that?

221
00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:26.183
Today, you hit a little girl and drove off.

222
00:15:26.183 --> 00:15:31.103
You then continued to drive,
with those children in pursuit,

223
00:15:31.103 --> 00:15:32.973
and came by here...

224
00:15:32.973 --> 00:15:38.573
...by this factory owned by Ishikura-san,
whom you know and hate.

225
00:15:39.103 --> 00:15:41.033
Again, what are you talking about?

226
00:15:41.353 --> 00:15:45.493
Oh? So you want me to say it, after all?

227
00:15:46.063 --> 00:15:51.003
Ishikura-san's killer was you,
Shishido-san!

228
00:15:52.893 --> 00:15:55.563
Hey, now! What are you saying?!

229
00:15:55.563 --> 00:16:01.133
He was deemed innocent
for the murder, at the very least!

230
00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:02.603
Yes.

231
00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:06.023
It was believed that he couldn't have
committed it while fleeing,

232
00:16:06.023 --> 00:16:07.853
so he was cleared of all suspicion.

233
00:16:08.183 --> 00:16:11.563
Yeah! You even have
someone to vouch for me!

234
00:16:11.853 --> 00:16:14.063
The kids who chased me!

235
00:16:15.353 --> 00:16:17.893
But what if that was planned?

236
00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:21.683
What if you intended for these children,
the Junior Detective League,

237
00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:24.993
to act as witnesses for you?

238
00:16:24.993 --> 00:16:28.453
W-What?! What do you mean?!

239
00:16:28.813 --> 00:16:32.523
In short, what if Ayumi-kun's
hit-and-run incident

240
00:16:32.523 --> 00:16:36.423
had been meant to camouflage the murder?

241
00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:41.843
Y-You can't be serious!
Is that possible?!

242
00:16:42.273 --> 00:16:48.183
According to Conan, the car would
unnaturally stop at each turn,

243
00:16:48.183 --> 00:16:50.013
so they never lost sight of it.

244
00:16:50.683 --> 00:16:54.483
If he was doing this so they could
follow him, that would explain it.

245
00:16:55.023 --> 00:16:57.193
My car really was in bad shape!

246
00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:59.473
He's right, Mori-kun.

247
00:16:59.473 --> 00:17:04.153
The car's spark plugs were worn
and its engine was in bad condition.

248
00:17:04.153 --> 00:17:09.623
Even an amateur
could set that up, Inspector.

249
00:17:10.773 --> 00:17:17.833
Okay, then. Even if that were the case,
I have an alibi. A perfect one.

250
00:17:17.833 --> 00:17:23.753
Yes. Aside from the three
minutes the kids had lost sight of you.

251
00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:27.223
You can't do anything in three minutes.

252
00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:31.683
No, it would've been
more than enough to enter here.

253
00:17:32.853 --> 00:17:34.223
Ridiculous!

254
00:17:34.223 --> 00:17:38.433
The cigarette lady would've
seen my car stopped by the back door!

255
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:41.693
Oh? You know quite a lot...

256
00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:45.653
I worked here.
It's only natural that I know.

257
00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:51.203
Then you must naturally
know that shop's phone number, too.

258
00:17:53.063 --> 00:17:55.663
I don't know what you're getting at.

259
00:17:56.273 --> 00:18:01.503
You couldn't stop the car by
the back door. You walked here.

260
00:18:03.063 --> 00:18:06.463
Then what about the car?
How did it disappear?

261
00:18:06.813 --> 00:18:07.813
Conan!

262
00:18:07.813 --> 00:18:09.013
Right!

263
00:18:09.013 --> 00:18:10.983
C-Conan-kun!

264
00:18:10.983 --> 00:18:13.303
Where were you?!

265
00:18:13.603 --> 00:18:15.103
Never mind that!

266
00:18:15.103 --> 00:18:19.023
Show the inspector to the warehouse
you lifted me up to look into!

267
00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:21.063
To that warehouse?

268
00:18:26.683 --> 00:18:28.573
T-This car!

269
00:18:29.273 --> 00:18:31.273
It's the same as the hit-and-run car!

270
00:18:31.273 --> 00:18:33.033
The number matches exactly, too!

271
00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:40.183
Shishido-san.

272
00:18:40.183 --> 00:18:44.643
Why does a car exactly like
the hit-and run car exist here?!

273
00:18:44.643 --> 00:18:45.673
I don't know!

274
00:18:46.183 --> 00:18:50.223
He probably modified a stolen car.

275
00:18:50.223 --> 00:18:53.683
You worked at a sheet metal
and painting factory, Shishido-san.

276
00:18:54.023 --> 00:18:56.103
It would've been simple for you.

277
00:18:56.853 --> 00:19:02.683
First, you knocked Ishikura-san
out with a sedative or something,

278
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:05.733
then tied him up with
tape and left him there.

279
00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:10.523
You then took the modified
car and committed the hit-and-run.

280
00:19:11.453 --> 00:19:17.123
You stopped the car occasionally
so the children could follow you,

281
00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:22.583
eventually leading them to the factory,

282
00:19:23.543 --> 00:19:26.503
after which you hid the car in the warehouse.
Factory Office
Cigarette Shop

283
00:19:27.023 --> 00:19:30.973
Next, you called the cigarette
lady on your cell phone,

284
00:19:30.973 --> 00:19:35.183
passed by while her
back was to the road,

285
00:19:35.183 --> 00:19:38.103
and entered the office
through the back door.

286
00:19:38.103 --> 00:19:42.393
You quickly murdered Ishikura-san,
removed the tape,

287
00:19:42.393 --> 00:19:45.773
and made it look like a robbery murder.

288
00:19:45.773 --> 00:19:49.243
The safe was probably
put in disarray in advance.

289
00:19:50.283 --> 00:19:55.933
When leaving the office,
you called the cigarette shop lady again.

290
00:19:55.933 --> 00:20:01.933
You then hurried to the
other hidden car, took it out,

291
00:20:01.933 --> 00:20:04.533
and waited for the children at the turn.

292
00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:12.273
Of course, this one was your real
car with your real license plate,

293
00:20:12.273 --> 00:20:15.513
that you had tinkered with
in advance to be in bad shape.

294
00:20:15.853 --> 00:20:17.853
R-Really?!

295
00:20:17.853 --> 00:20:19.183
How shocking!

296
00:20:19.773 --> 00:20:24.023
I've heard enough! My car was
taken in after the hit-and-run!

297
00:20:24.023 --> 00:20:26.193
What proof do you have otherwise?!

298
00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:32.863
Detective Takagi. Was there any
mud on the car taken into custody?

299
00:20:33.693 --> 00:20:34.643
Mud?

300
00:20:34.643 --> 00:20:37.573
No, it was as clean as a new car.

301
00:20:38.223 --> 00:20:41.293
There are mud puddles next to the factory.

302
00:20:41.853 --> 00:20:47.793
If a car passed through there,
mud would splatter onto its body.

303
00:20:48.223 --> 00:20:53.093
Hey, you! Is there
any mud on that car?!

304
00:20:53.093 --> 00:20:56.303
Oh! Yes!
There is, near the bottom!

305
00:20:56.683 --> 00:21:01.473
What does that matter?!
The mud came off my car while driving!

306
00:21:01.853 --> 00:21:07.693
Detective! If you're claiming that's
the hit-and-run car, then prove it!

307
00:21:07.693 --> 00:21:09.353
Very well.

308
00:21:09.553 --> 00:21:10.603
Conan!

309
00:21:11.553 --> 00:21:15.063
Hey, Mitsuhiko! Call
Ayumi-chan with your badge!

310
00:21:15.593 --> 00:21:19.843
With my badge? But she lost hers!

311
00:21:19.843 --> 00:21:21.383
Just call her!

312
00:21:21.383 --> 00:21:22.533
Okay...

313
00:21:24.303 --> 00:21:26.663
Hello? Ayumi-chan? Do you read me?

314
00:21:27.093 --> 00:21:31.953
Respond if you do. This is
Mitsuhiko. How are you feeling?

315
00:21:31.953 --> 00:21:33.453
We'll come visit you later!

316
00:21:33.723 --> 00:21:36.473
Inspector! I found this badge on the car!

317
00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:37.373
What?!

318
00:21:39.553 --> 00:21:41.633
T-That's--!

319
00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:44.303
It's Ayumi's badge!

320
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:48.053
It fell out of her pocket and got
stuck to it during the hit-and-run!

321
00:21:48.383 --> 00:21:52.223
You intended to use us for your alibi,

322
00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:55.593
but it seems we wound
up proving your guilt instead.

323
00:21:58.723 --> 00:22:03.033
N-No! T-This can't be happening!

324
00:23:42.783 --> 00:23:45.383
Here, Ayumi-chan! I found your badge!

325
00:23:48.123 --> 00:23:49.823
Thank you, Conan-kun!

326
00:23:51.783 --> 00:23:53.453
Conan-kun...

327
00:23:53.453 --> 00:23:55.953
That's not fair...

328
00:23:55.953 --> 00:23:57.783
Hey! Conan! Where did she kiss you?!

329
00:23:57.783 --> 00:24:00.323
Let us kiss you there!

330
00:24:04.923 --> 00:24:06.953
Huh? It's unlocked...

331
00:24:07.623 --> 00:24:09.963
What a careless household...

332
00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:12.123
A blackout?

333
00:24:24.923 --> 00:24:26.683
There's a pinprick on her back!

334
00:24:28.623 --> 00:24:30.043
On the next Conan--

335
00:24:30.043 --> 00:24:33.353
"The Cooking Classroom
Murder Case (Part 1)."
