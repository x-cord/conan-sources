1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,040
The stage today is Teitan High School.

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,740
Stories that may also be heard in your school.

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,640
How many mysterious stories will there be in this episode?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,940
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,725
Nightmare.

8
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:43,225
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,825
What?

10
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:47,025
The ghost scare at school?

11
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,325
Right! I feel really eerie

12
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:53,525
because there's been a lot of ghost scare in school recently.

13
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:56,025
Moreover, they say that people always see that apparition

14
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,025
early in the morning.

15
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,425
Rumor has it that 2 years ago,

16
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,825
a student who used to come to school early in the morning

17
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,525
died in an accident,

18
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:06,525
and they say it's the curse of that student.

19
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:10,025
2 years ago is before I enrolled.

20
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,225
So please, dad!

21
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,225
Come to school at check things out after school today, okay?

22
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:17,625
To confirm whether it's really the doings of a ghost or not.

23
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,625
Let it be.

24
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,125
It's probably just someone playing a prank

25
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,025
or some natural phenomenon.

26
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:26,425
Besides, if that ghost appears at school early in the morning,

27
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,625
it doesn't appear during class hours, does it?

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,925
I guess, but...

29
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:33,225
As the daughter of renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

30
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,325
I will not let such unreasonable rumor

31
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:37,025
of something that doesn't even exist run free!

32
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:40,925
You said you were going to be monitor next week, right, Ran?

33
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:42,325
What?

34
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:43,525
Yes.

35
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,525
I see. You're afraid of going to school early in the morning,

36
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,025
so you want me to go check?

37
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,225
I can't help it because I don't like ghosts.

38
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,825
Get rid of it with your karate!

39
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,625
What makes you think that Karate is going to have any effect on ghosts?

40
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,125
Ran.

41
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,325
Do you want me to go with you?

42
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,525
I may come up with a hint to at least solve the mystery.

43
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:10,825
"Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 1)"

44
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,625
Conan!

45
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,325
Over here!

46
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,925
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ran.

47
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,525
Hey, Ran.

48
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,125
Don't tell me that this glasses kid

49
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,625
is the help you called for the ghost scare?

50
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,025
But Dad won't come,

51
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:31,625
saying that a renowned detective can't come to check out such a crazy case.

52
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,425
Well, he may not suffice as an aide.

53
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:38,625
but he can at least serve as me, the deduction queen's, assistant.

54
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:42,325
You're the last person I'd like to hear that comment from.

55
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,425
This is the shoe box area.

56
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,225
It's a little larger than the one in your school, isn't it?

57
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,425
Yes.

58
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:52,425
I know. I've been coming to this school for about a year.

59
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,225
I'll put your shoes in my shoe slot, Conan.

60
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,725
Thank you, Ran.

61
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,525
What's with that boy, Ran?

62
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,525
Is he the much rumored about Conan?

63
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,125
Yes. Cute, isn't he?

64
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,225
Oh, no! It's blabber mouths Tashiro and Hidaka.

65
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,425
You can say that again!

66
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:14,125
He looks like a miniature Kudo and sure looks cheeky.

67
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,625
Sonny, don't grow up to be a deduction freak, okay?

68
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,025
None of your business.

69
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,925
Why'd you bring him here?

70
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,625
An assistant for investigation.

71
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,925
This glasses kid is pretty sharp, you know?

72
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,625
Investigation? You mean that ghost scare?

73
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,825
No kidding.

74
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:32,225
Aizawa and Nakamichi of the soccer club.

75
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:34,025
Don't bother.

76
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,225
You're going to be cursed.

77
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:38,725
Hey, will you stop saying things like that?

78
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:41,825
By the way, how'd your re-test go?

79
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:42,925
Just made it!

80
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,725
Although we were seriously on the brink.

81
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:45,925
True, very true.

82
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:49,825
I'm sure that one day, you'll run out of bad luck, too.

83
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:51,725
See you then, but take it easy.

84
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,425
If you find out who the ghost is, let me in on it.

85
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:57,025
-Okay. -Sure thing!

86
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,825
Is something the matter, Conan?

87
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,425
Nope, it's nothing.

88
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,525
Right. If things were the way they were supposed to be,

89
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:08,425
I would be coming to this school, studying,

90
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,925
talking of trivial things with my friends,

91
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:14,425
and leading a normal high school life.

92
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,125
Gin and Vodka...

93
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,425
If those men in black didn't force me to drink that strange drug,

94
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,525
and if I hadn't shrunk...

95
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,825
That woman Vermouth...

96
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:28,525
one of them that disguised herself as Dr. Araide,

97
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:31,525
got away from me just as I was about to corner her,

98
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,425
in order to get my body back to normal again

99
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:36,925
and regain my life as Shinichi Kudo.

100
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:40,925
That woman is probably an assassin who was sent out

101
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,425
to kill Ai who had betrayed the organization.

102
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:44,725
I remember her saying back then,

103
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,525
that she would give up on going after Ai.

104
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,825
I wonder if I can really believe what she said?

105
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,625
After all, she's a witch that has a thousand faces.

106
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,625
She's as good as Thief Kid when it comes to disguising herself.

107
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,525
She may still be around us disguised as somebody

108
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,225
and scheming to do something.

109
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,525
What?

110
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:11,625
Dr. Araide.

111
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,925
I heard that since the trial is over,

112
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,725
you returned to your hospital in Aomori.

113
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:20,625
No. I was planning on doing so, but decided against it.

114
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,025
I'm worried about my patients too, so...

115
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,425
And it's not that easy saying goodbye to you all either.

116
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,025
Then, you're going to remain being our school doctor?

117
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:31,625
Yes. I came today to tell the school of my intention.

118
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,525
The real doctor?

119
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:38,025
Hey! Conan!

120
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,725
Just what do you think you're doing?

121
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,825
Are you all right, doctor?

122
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:44,925
Yes, it's nothing.

123
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:48,425
The FBI agent called Jodie told me all about what happened.

124
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:49,425
Huh?

125
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,525
She told me that a bad person disguised as me

126
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:54,025
tried to do something bad.

127
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,625
She said she was sent back to the States for a while,

128
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,125
but it seems that Hikaru or her grandmother who accompanied her

129
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,525
did not take to the States very well.

130
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:04,725
Then, I heard that the bad person revealed herself and fled.

131
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:07,825
So, Jodie asked to return back here to Beikacho.

132
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,725
But why are you telling me all this?

133
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,725
I was told to tell only you because you'd surely be surprised.

134
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,025
That's right!

135
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:20,325
Let's have Dr. Araide help us with the ghost investigation, too.

136
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,525
That sounds great!

137
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:23,925
What? Ghost investigation?

138
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:29,625
First, let's start here.

139
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,325
The wailing storeroom of the gym.

140
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:42,725
One rainy day, a girl student of the gymnastic club

141
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,725
who came here early in the morning to prepare for morning practice

142
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,725
heard a wailing voice.

143
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:52,225
The wailing leaked out of the storeroom

144
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,125
where nobody was supposed to be.

145
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,925
The horrifying sound of someone wailing!

146
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,625
And...

147
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,825
The girl student got scared and left,

148
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:07,225
bringing other people of her club back to the place

149
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:09,525
but the wailing had stopped.

150
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,125
And the only thing left was this desk!

151
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,725
It was the desk of a boy student, Hideaki Hosaka,

152
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:20,325
who died mysteriously at this school 2 years ago!

153
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,925
Talk about exaggeration.

154
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,225
It so conspicuous that it would scare no one.

155
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,125
Hey, Ran.

156
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,825
That's no mystery or anything.

157
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:35,325
He unfortunately tripped on the stairs,

158
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,925
"Kazumi Tsukamoto (18)" -and hit the wrong place. That's it.

159
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:40,225
Don't go spreading strange rumors.

160
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,225
Kazumi.

161
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,225
Mouri, just what are you doing here?

162
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,425
The Karate club is off today, isn't it?

163
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:51,825
A senior and the previous captain of the Karate club.

164
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,025
I'm investigating the ghost case.

165
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,425
You mean the wailing case?

166
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,625
If it's that everyone's saying that,

167
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,925
-it was probably the trick of the wind. -What?

168
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:07,025
See? That skylight with the broken lock.

169
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,925
It's said the when the wind blows in from there,

170
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,425
the sound of the howling of the wind

171
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,425
was taken to be the sound of someone wailing.

172
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,025
It's amazing that you figured out that

173
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:18,725
this desk was the boy student's desk.

174
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,425
I told everyone about it because there was so much fuss over it.

175
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,625
I was his classmate, besides.

176
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,725
Is that so?

177
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:33,525
Why is his desk in a place like this, though?

178
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,625
It started to rain.

179
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,225
No way. I don't have an umbrella.

180
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,425
Neither do I.

181
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,525
Then, would you like to take shelter from the rain until it stops?

182
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,625
What?

183
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,425
At the cursed library.

184
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:52,425
I was just about to go there myself, too.

185
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:55,625
-Shall we go there? -Of course.

186
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,325
What's this? A signature?

187
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:04,225
It's starting to rain cats and dogs.

188
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:05,725
I wonder if it's going to stop.

189
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,225
Don't worry. According to the weather forecast,

190
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,025
this is supposed to be rain shower.

191
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:13,525
Dr. Araide, you sure are a push-over like always

192
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,825
coming along to investigate a ghost scare by request of a student.

193
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,625
Well, yes.

194
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,825
Huh?

195
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,425
Seko.

196
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:28,525
Where were you? I was looking for you.

197
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,625
"Kunishige Seko (18)" -I had an upset stomach,

198
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,525
so I cut the afternoon class and was resting in the infirmary.

199
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,925
-Are you all right? -Yeah.

200
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:40,225
Did you want anything? Tsukamoto.

201
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:43,025
It's not anything important, so I guess I'll get to it some other time.

202
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:48,125
Well, I guess I'll rest a while more than, before going home.

203
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,525
Before that worried teacher decides to lug me off to the hospital.

204
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,225
"Infirmary"

205
00:11:57,825 --> 00:12:02,025
Was he also a classmate of the boy named Hosaka?

206
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,125
No, he was in a different class.

207
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,725
But he seems to have been childhood friends with Hosaka.

208
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,025
How unusual!

209
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,025
That an athletic person like you would be coming to the library.

210
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,625
How rude! I read books too, you know?

211
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,225
Besides, I have the entrance exam of university coming up next year.

212
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:21,325
Besides, just like you two,

213
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,325
I'm also investigating the ghost scare.

214
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:27,425
"Library"

215
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:30,625
When you came this morning, the books were left out on the table?

216
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,625
Yes.

217
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,425
And all those books were ones that Hosaka had borrowed before.

218
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:38,325
Moreover, this happened four consecutive days in a row, you know?

219
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,325
No matter how you think of it,

220
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,825
this is none other than the curse of Hosaka

221
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,525
who couldn't read the book as much as he wanted to!

222
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,125
Hey.

223
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,625
But if the books are not put away,

224
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,625
I think that the librarian would notice when locking the library.

225
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,325
It seems that the 4 books were found, one behind the bookshelf,

226
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,725
another under the desk and so on forth.

227
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,925
I think it's somebody whose taking advantage

228
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:02,125
of the ghost scare and playing pranks, though.

229
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,625
If I ever catch the brat that's doing this,

230
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,825
I'm going to get him for sure and bust him up.

231
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:10,125
So, when the time comes, you help me too, okay, Mouri?

232
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,625
Okay.

233
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,725
Now, finally for these cursed stairs.

234
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,425
When a student came to these stairs early in the morning,

235
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:21,325
the bottom of the stairs was soaked with water, right?

236
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:25,525
Yes. It seems that these are the stairs that boy fell from, too.

237
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:29,525
It's probably the cursed tears of the boy named Hosaka!

238
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,325
Maybe the window wasn't closed tight,

239
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:34,425
and it rained the day before.

240
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:35,825
I mean, we're not kids, you know?

241
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,525
So the windows would've been closed.

242
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,225
Besides, that's not the only thing.

243
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,125
It's rumored that the number of the steps of these stairs

244
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,925
are different each time you count them.

245
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:45,325
Then, why don't both try counting them?

246
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,025
What?

247
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:50,125
Okay, we'll show you!

248
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,125
One, two...

249
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,525
Three, four, five...

250
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:01,025
Six, seven, eight...

251
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:03,225
Nine, ten...

252
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,925
Ran, how many did you count?

253
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,525
Twelve.

254
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,625
What? I counted thirteen!

255
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,425
No kidding! Why?

256
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,425
The correct answer is twelve steps.

257
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,125
You probably counted one extra step

258
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,425
when you brought both you feet together

259
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,125
and made it all the way up the steps.

260
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,425
That's because you keep thinking that this whole thing is scary.

261
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:28,325
Okay. All I gotta do is count it over again, right?

262
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,525
Rather, do you really have the intention

263
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,725
of solving the mystery about this ghost scare or what?

264
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,725
"Masao Monobe (18)" -Hey, you guys!

265
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:36,525
Will you cut out the noise?

266
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,425
I can't concentrate on drawing!

267
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,125
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:43,125
I'm sorry!

269
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,525
Huh? That student...

270
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,425
It seems to have stopped raining.

271
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:50,825
Well, shall we go home for today?

272
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,425
I guess so.

273
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,925
After listening to you, Conan,

274
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,025
I'm starting to feel that no such thing exist,

275
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,025
and I feel a bit courageous now.

276
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,325
Besides, it's getting kind of dark outside, too.

277
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,225
What's that?

278
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:06,625
What?

279
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,746
That desk...

280
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,546
It can't be...

281
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:22,246
the one we just saw, could it?

282
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:23,446
Conan!

283
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,046
There's something on top of the desk.

284
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:38,846
My grudge has not yet vanished.

285
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:44,746
Who could've played a prank like this?

286
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,446
The paper's not wet,

287
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,546
so it must've been put here after it stopped raining.

288
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,346
If so, something's strange.

289
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:52,746
What?

290
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,846
The soil is muddy with rain.

291
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:58,346
The thing that's supposed to be here is not here.

292
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:01,946
The footprints of the one who brought the desk here.

293
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,546
Just as I thought.

294
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:08,546
The desk and the chair out there are the ones

295
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:11,146
that were in the storeroom of the gym after all!

296
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:14,046
Yes. There's no doubt that the desk is the one of the student

297
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:18,346
called Hideaki Hosaka that died here at this high school.

298
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:21,046
Then, somebody put it out there to play a prank?

299
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,546
Yes. There was a piece of paper on the desk,

300
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:26,546
which wasn't wet,

301
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:30,846
so it was probably put there after the rain stopped.

302
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:33,346
But, then it's strange.

303
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:36,146
The ground of the campus where it was, was muddy with rain,

304
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:39,346
but the only footprints left were Conan and mine's that got there

305
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,346
when we ran over to the desk.

306
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:42,646
It's a ghost!

307
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:46,746
I'm sure the ghost of that student called Hosaka took it there!

308
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,446
It's possible.

309
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,246
Because ghosts don't have legs.

310
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,546
Come on, all of you...

311
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,646
Hey.

312
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,646
The desk and chair are gone!

313
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,646
No way! How can they?

314
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:03,446
Dr. Araide and I returned them to the storeroom of the gym.

315
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:04,846
What?

316
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:05,846
We didn't want to entertain

317
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:07,746
the one who did it by making a big fuss over it.

318
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:11,146
And besides, something strange was written on the paper on top the desk.

319
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:13,446
Strange?

320
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:16,746
It seems to have been written with a brush and was quite sloppy.

321
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:19,646
My grudge has not yet vanished.

322
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:24,946
Then, why wasn't that paper wet?

323
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,746
Because the ghost was writing his grudge filled sentence

324
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,946
with his body over the desk in the rain.

325
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,846
You guys... I don't see how you can come up

326
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:34,146
with one idea after the other like that...

327
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:39,746
Is anything the matter?

328
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:47,646
He... he held a grudge against me, after all.

329
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:52,846
This ghost scare is his curse!

330
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:58,046
By chance, do you happen to know this student called Hosaka?

331
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,046
Yeah.

332
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,746
He was a member of the art club with me.

333
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:07,046
But he fell off those stairs back then two years ago.

334
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:08,446
Back then...

335
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:11,046
Don't tell me you were there when this happened?

336
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,546
Just as I thought.

337
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:16,946
Back then when the accident occurred, this student...

338
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,646
-Please leave. -What?

339
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:24,146
The teacher was nice enough to let me use this art room all by myself

340
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,846
so that I would be able to complete my piece for the contest.

341
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:29,146
Go on, quickly!

342
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:32,046
I don't want to waste any time!

343
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,446
Okay.

344
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:48,346
Should we let Kazumi know that the desk was out on campus, too?

345
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:49,746
Okay.

346
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,846
Something's shining.

347
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:55,346
What is it?

348
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,146
Wax?

349
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:02,746
What's the matter, Conan?

350
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:06,746
You said that the bottom of the stairs was soaked with water,

351
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,446
but was it this floor that was leaking?

352
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:12,746
Right! The entire floor!

353
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:17,346
The tears of the curse of the student named Hosaka that died here.

354
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,746
Who found that?

355
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:22,146
I heard that it was someone from the art club

356
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:23,646
that came here early in the morning.

357
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:28,146
Hey, is that for real?

358
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:32,246
Is it true that Hosaka's desk and chair were out on campus?

359
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,946
Yes. And on the desk was a paper that said,

360
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:38,646
"My grudge has not yet vanished."

361
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,246
I'm really pissed!

362
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,446
This is going too far as a prank!

363
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:43,546
If you find the one who's doing this,

364
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:46,146
make sure you grab him and bring him here no matter what!

365
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,846
We'll give him a good licking together!

366
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:52,146
I think your spin kick will suffice, though.

367
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,746
Hey.

368
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,246
Do you know what kind of books were not put away

369
00:19:56,246 --> 00:20:00,746
and borrowed by Hosaka before?

370
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:01,846
Yes.

371
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:07,046
They're all difficult books that you don't see around too often.

372
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,046
It's not at all surprising.

373
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,046
See! Take a look at this library card!

374
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:14,646
These four books seems to have been borrowed virtually only

375
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,946
by the student called Hosaka.

376
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:18,446
Hosaka wanted to be a comic wirter.

377
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:20,046
He used to always say that in order to write an interesting story,

378
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,746
it was useful to keep in mind

379
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:25,446
all kinds of things that people aren't familiar with.

380
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:26,546
I see.

381
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:29,746
You saw his signature on the edge of the desk, didn't you?

382
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,446
That's the signature he told everyone

383
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:35,946
that he was going to use in the future when he becomes famous.

384
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,646
Then, then...

385
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:40,146
His dream was severed part way too,

386
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:43,446
so he must've felt super attachment to it!

387
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:46,046
He wet the bottom of the stairs with his tears of curse.

388
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,246
At midnight, he re-read the books in the library

389
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,446
with his heart full of hate.

390
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:53,246
He finally brings his desk that is in the storeroom of the gym out

391
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,946
-into the campus grounds... -Hey, hold it, Sonoko!

392
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:57,446
Ran.

393
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:59,846
Enough with the drama.

394
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:02,746
Oh, right. If we ask the principal,

395
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:06,146
he may know something about it.

396
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:10,146
After you left the library, I got up to go to the restroom

397
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:13,346
and saw a glimpse of him through the window on the 3rd floor.

398
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:17,146
Like always, he was standing in place on campus.

399
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:24,346
The principal was thinking of what tree to plant there?

400
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:27,246
Yes. He'd go out there everyday,

401
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,446
trying to decide what to plant.

402
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:32,346
So, the principal is still undecided.

403
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,646
I remember that the principal said that

404
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:37,946
he discussed it with you, too, Dr. Araide.

405
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,046
What?

406
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:41,146
Yeah, right. That's right.

407
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:43,646
Well, it's only natural that he wouldn't know about it.

408
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:46,946
Because Vermouth was the one disguised as Araide

409
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:49,946
as soon as he became the school doctor of Teitan High School.

410
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:52,746
Come to think of it, Vermouth disguised as Dr. Araide

411
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:55,946
was also in charge of Teitan Elementary School.

412
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,146
An 18 year-old just like you.

413
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:01,146
If Ai, who betrayed the organization

414
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,446
is really between the age of 18 and 20,

415
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:06,946
and if their looking for her in one of the high schools here,

416
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:09,546
looking into high schools and universities should suffice.

417
00:22:09,546 --> 00:22:10,946
If they were thinking that

418
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:14,346
Ai had shrunk and become a child like me to begin with,

419
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:15,546
why couldn't they find her

420
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:18,946
as soon as Dr. Araide became the school doctor?

421
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:22,946
There is nothing like a new student who catches the eye.

422
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:25,546
So, why didn't it?

423
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,546
Gosh! It sure bothers me!

424
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:30,146
Thanks to the ghost scare,

425
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:32,246
I've come up with other things that I've got to work on.

426
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,946
"Next Episode" -Which means that

427
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:02,646
the person making up the ghost scare is...

428
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,746
Still in the school building somewhere!

429
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:07,546
Will you all wait for me in front of the art room?

430
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:11,046
I've figured out a way to find out who is doing all this.

431
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:14,046
Let's just wait forever very quietly.

432
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,346
Wait for what?

433
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:18,546
What else...

434
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:23,546
but for the ghost of Mr. Hosaka to come dripping wet down the stairs.

435
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:29,546
Next Conan, "Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 2)"

436
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:32,973
Next Conan's Hint:

437
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,773
"Umbrella"

438
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,173
The wailing storeroom.

439
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,273
The library filled with grudge.

440
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:39,273
The cursed stairs.
