1
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.410
How wonderful!

2
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.410
It's like a festival.

3
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.410
They're launching these fireworks

4
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.610
to celebrate Ms. Anna's birthday, right?

5
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.010
That's amazing.

6
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.410
Ms. Anna's dog food company, Happywow,

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.810
is experiencing explosive growth right now.

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.410
A couple hundred fireworks are nothing to her.

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.310
Mr. Kogoro!

10
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.010
Ms. Anna!

11
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.110
Ran!

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.210
"Anna Hinomiya (24), Happywow President" -Conan!

13
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.910
-Ms. Anna! -Ms. Anna!

14
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.610
It's 8 pm already.

15
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.910
Ms. Anna, we'll be right there!

16
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.710
Congratulations, president.

17
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.210
Thank you.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.710
I appreciate it.

19
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.610
"Machiko Enami (31)" -You went through a lot to get here,

20
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810
"Happywow Director" -but this is the best time of your life.

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.310
It's all thanks to you, Machiko and VP Inamura.

22
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310
"Koshiro Inamura(45)" -This is from me.

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.510
"Happywow Vice President" -It's champagne from your birth year.

24
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.910
Thank you.

25
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.510
I got you something too.

26
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.610
A present.

27
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.810
What is it?

28
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.710
Why?

29
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.710
Stop...

30
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.910
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

31
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.010
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

32
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.810
A beautiful company president is shot

33
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.510
in a terrifying incident by a nimble man wearing a black mask!

34
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.110
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.910
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.110
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:04:57.252 --> 00:05:02.952
"The Poodle and the Shotgun (Part 1)"

38
00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:23.252
So the culprit suddenly fired at Ms. Anna with a shotgun?

39
00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:24.252
Yes.

40
00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:27.552
Looks like their only target was the president.

41
00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:28.952
After shooting Anna,

42
00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:31.752
they immediately leapt onto another boat.

43
00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:34.152
They fled in an instant.

44
00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:41.252
Their testimony is accurate.

45
00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:43.452
I witnessed it too.

46
00:05:43.452 --> 00:05:45.452
Not just me.

47
00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:47.152
I saw it too.

48
00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:48.952
So did Conan.

49
00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:50.052
Huh?

50
00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:52.052
Where did that kid go?

51
00:06:03.352 --> 00:06:05.752
Fine scratches on her nails.

52
00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:07.252
What are these?

53
00:06:08.652 --> 00:06:09.652
Hey, kid!

54
00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:14.652
Don't you know you'll get in the way there?

55
00:06:14.652 --> 00:06:16.652
It hurts...

56
00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:21.352
It hurts...

57
00:06:21.352 --> 00:06:23.352
Sorry.

58
00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:28.452
Huh? Something smells.

59
00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:29.952
It's dog food.

60
00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:33.252
Dog food, huh?

61
00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:37.152
It's a new product Ms. Anna's company will be selling.

62
00:06:44.952 --> 00:06:46.152
In here?

63
00:06:46.152 --> 00:06:48.852
Yes. I heard something.

64
00:06:48.852 --> 00:06:50.552
Dad, be careful.

65
00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:51.852
I've got this.

66
00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:19.052
You said you are Morishima, right?

67
00:07:19.052 --> 00:07:21.252
What on earth happened?

68
00:07:21.252 --> 00:07:22.652
Well...

69
00:07:22.652 --> 00:07:24.952
"Sota Morishima (22)" -I was suddenly hit over the head.

70
00:07:24.952 --> 00:07:27.752
"President's Secretary" -When I came to, I was in there.

71
00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:31.952
Were you invited to Ms. Anna's birthday party as well?

72
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.752
No. I'm Ms. Anna's secretary.

73
00:07:36.852 --> 00:07:38.852
I arrived an hour early at 7 pm

74
00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:40.952
to prepare for the party.

75
00:07:40.952 --> 00:07:43.452
I was suddenly struck on the head

76
00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:45.752
while loading luggage into the cabin.

77
00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.852
I woke up when I heard the gunshots

78
00:08:07.852 --> 00:08:10.152
and found myself inside the locker.

79
00:08:10.152 --> 00:08:13.752
So you were unconscious until then?

80
00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:16.952
Yes.

81
00:08:18.252 --> 00:08:21.552
Inspector, if no one's seen their face,

82
00:08:21.552 --> 00:08:24.552
it will be impossible to identify the culprit.

83
00:08:24.552 --> 00:08:27.452
No, I know who did it.

84
00:08:28.552 --> 00:08:29.852
That's right.

85
00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:33.152
He's the only one who could have done this.

86
00:08:33.152 --> 00:08:35.052
He?

87
00:08:35.052 --> 00:08:36.652
Hyodo.

88
00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:38.152
Makoto Hyodo.

89
00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:40.652
What? Hyodo?

90
00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.452
Mouri, you know him?

91
00:08:42.452 --> 00:08:46.952
Yes. Hyodo is Ms. Anna's ex-boyfriend.

92
00:08:46.952 --> 00:08:49.752
He claimed to be a management consultant

93
00:08:49.752 --> 00:08:53.252
but when I looked into it, I discovered

94
00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:56.052
"Makoto Hyodo (38)" -that he was a conman.

95
00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:57.852
A conman?

96
00:08:57.852 --> 00:09:01.252
He offered Ms. Anna a fake investment offer

97
00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:05.452
and stole close to 50 million from Happywow.

98
00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:07.452
That's not all.

99
00:09:07.452 --> 00:09:11.052
He also owed Anna herself a huge amount of money.

100
00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:15.052
Only the president herself knew exactly how much he took

101
00:09:15.052 --> 00:09:17.552
but we repeatedly urged her

102
00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:21.452
to file a proper reimbursement claim.

103
00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:23.552
And now this has happened.

104
00:09:28.452 --> 00:09:30.452
Darn that Hyodo!

105
00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:32.652
He won't get away with this!

106
00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:33.652
Huh?

107
00:09:34.752 --> 00:09:37.652
-Takagi. -Yes, sir.

108
00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:40.552
Hey, Mr. Morishima.

109
00:09:40.552 --> 00:09:44.852
Did you bring the presents for Ms. Anna too?

110
00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.452
A present?

111
00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:50.452
There was a bottle decorated with a ribbon

112
00:09:50.452 --> 00:09:52.252
and a box on the deck.

113
00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:59.652
VP Inamura and Director Enami brought those themselves.

114
00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:01.252
The VP got her champagne

115
00:10:01.252 --> 00:10:03.852
and the director got her a watch.

116
00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:05.352
A watch?

117
00:10:05.352 --> 00:10:07.252
How do you know that?

118
00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:08.952
They're busy people

119
00:10:08.952 --> 00:10:11.352
so I went to buy their gifts for them.

120
00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:15.052
Both the champagne and the watch are incredibly high quality.

121
00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:19.052
Are you also the one who brought the dog food into the cabin?

122
00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:23.052
Yeah. I thought the president would bring her dog.

123
00:10:23.052 --> 00:10:29.152
Right. Ms. Anna is always with her poodle, Sally.

124
00:10:29.152 --> 00:10:33.152
But I wonder why she didn't bring her today.

125
00:10:34.752 --> 00:10:38.452
Did Ms. Anna expect this?

126
00:10:39.652 --> 00:10:40.852
Stop!

127
00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:44.052
Stop right there, Hyodo!

128
00:10:44.052 --> 00:10:45.252
You jerk!

129
00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:48.852
How dare you kill Ms. Anna!

130
00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:52.052
Don't hurt him, Mr. Mouri!

131
00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:55.852
Let go! I'll beat this guy to a pulp!

132
00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.752
Wait! I didn't do it!

133
00:10:58.752 --> 00:11:00.952
He's the one who killed Anna!

134
00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.552
He?

135
00:11:02.552 --> 00:11:04.752
The vice president, Inamura!

136
00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:07.452
He's got a shotgun!

137
00:11:07.452 --> 00:11:08.652
What?

138
00:11:15.052 --> 00:11:18.252
It's true that I own a shotgun.

139
00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:20.652
Skeet shooting is my hobby.

140
00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:22.952
Why did you hide that fact?

141
00:11:22.952 --> 00:11:26.552
I wasn't trying to hide it.

142
00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:29.152
It was stolen recently.

143
00:11:30.552 --> 00:11:32.452
Stolen?

144
00:11:32.452 --> 00:11:35.652
Yes. Three days ago while I was preparing to go out,

145
00:11:35.652 --> 00:11:36.652
along with my entire car.

146
00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:40.752
That gun must have been used in the crime.

147
00:11:40.752 --> 00:11:43.952
But I have nothing to do with the case.

148
00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:46.752
I even filed a robbery report.

149
00:11:47.952 --> 00:11:50.352
I'm sure it's all a ruse.

150
00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:51.652
What?

151
00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:54.652
Or maybe Machiko stole it.

152
00:11:54.652 --> 00:11:56.152
Me?

153
00:11:56.152 --> 00:11:59.652
You've got plenty of motive to kill Anna.

154
00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.952
Stop that.

155
00:12:01.952 --> 00:12:03.552
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:05.452 --> 00:12:07.452
You're the one who taught Anna about business

157
00:12:07.452 --> 00:12:10.052
when she was an unsuccessful idol.

158
00:12:10.052 --> 00:12:13.052
Now your positions are reversed.

159
00:12:13.052 --> 00:12:17.752
You were angry and in disbelief that Anna was the president.

160
00:12:17.752 --> 00:12:19.352
You're lying.

161
00:12:19.352 --> 00:12:21.852
I know everything.

162
00:12:21.852 --> 00:12:24.652
After all, you and I used to date.

163
00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:26.852
What?

164
00:12:26.852 --> 00:12:29.952
You resented Anna

165
00:12:29.952 --> 00:12:32.352
because I dumped you for a younger woman.

166
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.552
You swore you'd kill her someday.

167
00:12:34.552 --> 00:12:35.952
You're making it all up!

168
00:12:35.952 --> 00:12:39.652
You're the one who had a motive to kill Anna!

169
00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:42.852
You owe Anna a huge amount of debt.

170
00:12:42.852 --> 00:12:46.152
Maybe you killed her because she was demanding you repay her.

171
00:12:46.152 --> 00:12:47.652
You're one to talk.

172
00:12:47.652 --> 00:12:49.752
You're the one who benefits most from Anna's death

173
00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:52.152
as the vice president.

174
00:12:52.152 --> 00:12:53.552
What?

175
00:12:53.552 --> 00:12:56.952
Making Anna the president was your idea.

176
00:12:56.952 --> 00:13:00.252
But once the company was on track, you didn't need her anymore.

177
00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:02.052
She was just in your way.

178
00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:04.052
That's enough!

179
00:13:04.052 --> 00:13:07.952
Ms. Anna wasn't shot by Mr. Inamura or Ms. Enami!

180
00:13:07.952 --> 00:13:09.352
It was the masked man!

181
00:13:09.352 --> 00:13:10.852
In other words, you!

182
00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:13.752
What? Do you have anything to prove that?

183
00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:15.252
Proof?

184
00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:18.052
Well...

185
00:13:18.052 --> 00:13:19.452
You see...

186
00:13:19.452 --> 00:13:20.952
See?

187
00:13:20.952 --> 00:13:23.852
You're assuming I did it when you don't even have any evidence.

188
00:13:23.852 --> 00:13:28.252
Mr. Hyodo, does that mean you have an alibi?

189
00:13:28.252 --> 00:13:29.952
An alibi?

190
00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.652
Between 7 pm and 8 pm,

191
00:13:32.652 --> 00:13:34.552
the culprit hid in the cabin of the cruiser

192
00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:37.052
and waited for Ms. Anna to arrive.

193
00:13:37.052 --> 00:13:41.552
Surely you can prove where you were during that time.

194
00:13:41.552 --> 00:13:43.752
Between 7 pm to 8 pm?

195
00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:49.152
I have no choice. I guess I'll confess.

196
00:13:49.152 --> 00:13:51.452
I knew it. You killed Ms. Anna.

197
00:13:51.452 --> 00:13:52.952
No.

198
00:13:52.952 --> 00:13:57.452
During that time, I was robbing Anna's apartment.

199
00:13:57.452 --> 00:13:58.952
Robbing her?

200
00:14:00.052 --> 00:14:02.852
It was on a whim.

201
00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:05.952
I have a spare key to Anna's place.

202
00:14:05.952 --> 00:14:10.052
And I knew she was throwing her birthday party here at 8 pm.

203
00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:12.752
So I went when she'd be away.

204
00:14:14.452 --> 00:14:18.152
I think it was around 7:20 pm.

205
00:14:18.152 --> 00:14:21.352
There was only 30 thousand in cash,

206
00:14:21.352 --> 00:14:24.552
but just as I was leaving with it.

207
00:14:27.452 --> 00:14:31.952
I accidentally dropped my gym membership card.

208
00:14:31.952 --> 00:14:35.052
If you think I'm lying, search her apartment.

209
00:14:35.052 --> 00:14:37.252
Where is Ms. Anna's apartment?

210
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:41.952
It's about 10 km west down the coast from here.

211
00:14:41.952 --> 00:14:45.252
It's a 15 minute drive one way.

212
00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:50.452
Why is he so confident?

213
00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:15.319
This must be the card.

214
00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:17.519
That's Mr. Hyodo's card.

215
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.419
What? Conan!

216
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.319
I followed you.

217
00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:23.419
It's just like he testified.

218
00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:25.319
Yeah.

219
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.719
Conan, you shouldn't look in there.

220
00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:35.519
It hurts!

221
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.719
No...

222
00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:38.919
Sally!

223
00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.219
Dog?

224
00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:44.619
I'm beat.

225
00:15:44.619 --> 00:15:48.119
I fell on my butt on the boat

226
00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:50.619
and then got it bitten by a dog.

227
00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:58.019
What's that?

228
00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:00.919
It's a pet camera.

229
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:04.519
It livestreams footage to the owner's phone

230
00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.419
so they can check on their pet

231
00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:09.119
while they're out of the house.

232
00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:14.419
So today's video should be on Ms. Anna's phone.

233
00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:24.719
If Hyodo's testimony is true, then...

234
00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:28.219
There should be video of him robbing the house on here.

235
00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:30.419
Someone's coming in.

236
00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:36.519
Hyodo's testimony was right.

237
00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:38.619
We can't see his face.

238
00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:40.619
We don't know that it's Hyodo.

239
00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:43.319
But the time is 7:20 pm.

240
00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:46.419
That's the same time Hyodo said.

241
00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.519
This is it.

242
00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:59.519
This is the card.

243
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.419
It's just like Hyodo testified.

244
00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:09.919
You knew she had a pet camera

245
00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:13.019
and dropped your card on purpose.

246
00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:14.719
What are you talking about?

247
00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:16.019
Don't play dumb!

248
00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.819
You did it to fabricate your alibi!

249
00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.519
You're not the thief in the video!

250
00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:24.519
It's your accomplice pretending to be you!

251
00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:26.319
Accomplice?

252
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.619
If I have an accomplice,

253
00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.719
why don't you bring them here?

254
00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:33.319
What?

255
00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:35.019
See?

256
00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:38.619
It was impossible for me to kill Anna.

257
00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:41.819
But even if he didn't have an accomplice,

258
00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:45.019
he still could've killed Ms. Anna.

259
00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:48.519
Mr. Morishima, weren't you unconscious

260
00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:51.819
inside that locker the whole time?

261
00:17:51.819 --> 00:17:53.419
Yeah.

262
00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:58.019
If he left the boat while Mr. Morishima was unconscious

263
00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:01.319
and sped to Ms. Anna's apartment,

264
00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:05.819
he could've arrived by 7:20 pm.

265
00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:07.419
That's it.

266
00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:10.019
If he broke into her apartment pretending to rob her,

267
00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:12.819
deliberately dropped his card so the camera would see it

268
00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:15.619
and then returned immediately by car,

269
00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:19.519
he could've killed Ms. Anna by 8 pm.

270
00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:21.219
I see.

271
00:18:21.219 --> 00:18:23.019
Well, Hyodo?

272
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.619
Your alibi has broken down.

273
00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:30.219
Are you sure about that?

274
00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:41.019
It's only possible if Mr. Morishima was actually unconscious.

275
00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:43.219
What do you mean, Conan?

276
00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:44.419
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:50.119
I wasn't actually unconscious the whole time.

278
00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.119
-What? -What?

279
00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:54.019
I actually regained consciousness

280
00:18:54.019 --> 00:18:56.819
as soon as I was stuffed into the locker.

281
00:18:56.819 --> 00:18:58.819
I was watching the masked man's back

282
00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:01.819
from inside the locker.

283
00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:06.119
I didn't know what he'd do if he noticed

284
00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:08.419
so I pretended to be unconscious.

285
00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:12.219
So the culprit was on the ship the whole time?

286
00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:15.019
Yes. I'm certain of it.

287
00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:17.319
Why didn't you say anything?

288
00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:18.919
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:22.219
If I'd raised the alarm then,

290
00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:25.419
it's possible the president wouldn't have been shot.

291
00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:30.819
I let the president die.

292
00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:36.519
I'm surprised you knew

293
00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:39.219
Mr. Morishima had regained consciousness.

294
00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:43.419
Mr. Morishima's mouth was covered with tape,

295
00:19:43.419 --> 00:19:45.719
but he wasn't blindfolded.

296
00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:50.119
Maybe the culprit knew that

297
00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:53.019
Mr. Morishima would wake up immediately

298
00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:57.119
and that he'd stay quiet inside the locker.

299
00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:59.519
In other words, they planned to use Mr. Morishima

300
00:19:59.519 --> 00:20:02.019
as their alibi from the start.

301
00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:03.419
Most likely.

302
00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:06.019
If he planned all that,

303
00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:09.719
it makes him all the more suspicious.

304
00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:12.919
You're treating me like a suspect based on suspicion alone?

305
00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:15.419
There's no evidence of any of this!

306
00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:19.819
Officer, his testimony has made things clear.

307
00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:23.719
The culprit who shot Anna never left the ship.

308
00:20:23.719 --> 00:20:26.019
I'm the one who robbed her apartment

309
00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:29.419
and it was someone else who shot Anna.

310
00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:33.019
Officer, I'm admitting to a robbery.

311
00:20:33.019 --> 00:20:35.719
Why don't you arrest me already?

312
00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:39.119
We still need to conduct an investigation before we arrest you.

313
00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:42.719
We'll question you again tomorrow.

314
00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:44.919
Really?

315
00:20:44.919 --> 00:20:46.919
Fine.

316
00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:50.419
Then I'm leaving for today.

317
00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.219
Sally.

318
00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:58.219
What?

319
00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:05.119
See you later.

320
00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.119
Inspector, it's him.

321
00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:10.519
He's the one who shot Ms. Anna.

322
00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.419
Proof.

323
00:21:12.419 --> 00:21:14.419
We need to find proof.

324
00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:21.219
Ms. Anna was shot with a shotgun...

325
00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:24.419
by the masked culprit.

326
00:21:38.119 --> 00:21:40.119
And they're the one who did it.

327
00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:56.419
"Next Episode" -It was definitely Hyodo

328
00:23:56.419 --> 00:23:58.519
who killed Ms. Anna.

329
00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:00.019
The question is...

330
00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:03.019
You're certain that this is your gun?

331
00:24:03.019 --> 00:24:05.119
That's definitely mine.

332
00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:07.319
The wood is cracked.

333
00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:09.719
I'm not lying!

334
00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:12.519
They were going to kill me, weren't they?

335
00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:15.019
You're accusing me of being an accomplice?

336
00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.419
Sally!

337
00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:20.319
Next Conan,

338
00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:24.319
"The Poodle and the Shotgun (Part 2)"

339
00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:26.962
Next Conan's Hint:

340
00:24:26.962 --> 00:24:29.262
"Pet camera"

341
00:24:29.262 --> 00:24:30.862
Poodles love Happywow!

342
00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:33.062
Ran, Pops eating it.

343
00:24:33.062 --> 00:24:34.362
What?
