1
00:00:04.523 --> 00:00:07.253
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:11.263
Today's case is about a face pack!
Can makeup hide the evidence?!

3
00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:13.763
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

4
00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.023
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

5
00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:18.473
His name? Detective Conan!

6
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:55.488
The Face Pack Murder Case.

7
00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:06.128
Kojima-san! It's Beika Security!

8
00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:08.848
Is something wrong, Kojima-san?!

9
00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:09.668
Let's go!

10
00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:10.628
Right!

11
00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:20.038
Kojima-san!
We're opening the door!

12
00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:20.838
Do it!

13
00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:21.518
Right!

14
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:24.268
Huh?

15
00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:29.608
I'm sorry! Did I scare you?

16
00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:31.078
No, no...

17
00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:34.128
I was putting my face pack on,
so I couldn't answer right away.

18
00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:37.448
Your security alarm went off...
did something happen?

19
00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.908
No, nothing at all.

20
00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:41.668
Must've been a glitch...

21
00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:44.498
Chiba-san...

22
00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:49.458
Looks like he's the culprit.

23
00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.628
He must've crossed
the infrared sensors.

24
00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:55.918
They're so sensitive that this
happens once in a while.

25
00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:56.968
Oh?

26
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.288
Well, please be sure to lock up!

27
00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:00.578
Thanks for your help.

28
00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.628
Boy, am I full!

29
00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:24.158
China has nothing on this place's
Chinese cuisine! Don't you think?!

30
00:03:24.418 --> 00:03:27.618
Actually, ramen's pretty
much the same anywhere...

31
00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:30.078
Oh, it's already this late?

32
00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:33.548
Not good! Yoko-chan's
drama show is on tonight!

33
00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:36.168
Yoko-chan! I'm coming home now!

34
00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:37.758
Wait, Dad!

35
00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:43.808
Dad!

36
00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:46.128
A-Are you all right?!

37
00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:47.598
Idiot! Watch where you're going!

38
00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:50.438
S-Sorry! I, uh...
Securities Employee Izumi Takeo (25)

39
00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.788
Watch where you're driving, will you?!

40
00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:56.788
Isn't it also your fault for crossing
the street without paying attention?

41
00:03:56.788 --> 00:03:57.358
Yeah!

42
00:03:57.748 --> 00:04:01.498
What's your guys' deal?

43
00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:02.328
Hello?

44
00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:05.288
Yes. Megure-san?

45
00:04:05.668 --> 00:04:08.248
Eh?! Police Investigation Section â™ª1?!

46
00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:11.788
Hello! Mori here!

47
00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:15.628
Why am I here?
Oh, that doesn't matter!

48
00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:17.508
What case are you on?

49
00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:21.218
Eh?! He's involved with a murder case?!

50
00:04:23.328 --> 00:04:26.208
Very well! You can count on me!

51
00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:27.478
Wait, Mori--!

52
00:04:30.878 --> 00:04:32.228
Oh, no, you don't!

53
00:04:33.998 --> 00:04:35.458
Give it up!

54
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:41.828
You just crossed paths
with the peerless Mori Kogoro!

55
00:04:41.828 --> 00:04:45.168
W-Wait! I have no
idea what's going on!

56
00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:48.908
Don't play dumb! You can spout
your excuses when we get there!

57
00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:53.458
Would the police call
a suspect on the phone?

58
00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:55.378
But he's...

59
00:05:04.748 --> 00:05:06.248
Inspector!

60
00:05:06.248 --> 00:05:07.578
C'mon!

61
00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:11.628
Oh, thanks for coming.

62
00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:15.398
I've brought the suspect,
as requested!

63
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.978
Huh? What're you talking about?

64
00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.128
Think about it.

65
00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:26.748
If Izumi Takeo-san were a suspect,
we obviously wouldn't call him.

66
00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:28.828
Oh, now that you mention it...

67
00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.248
Yeah, I figured as much.

68
00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:35.538
TM Securities, Beika Branch.

69
00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:39.958
Izumi Takeo-san.
You visited this home tonight, yes?

70
00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.298
Uhh, no... Yes.

71
00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:49.668
You came at 8:00 exactly,
and left at 8:40. Correct?

72
00:05:49.668 --> 00:05:50.978
I don't know the exact times...

73
00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:53.688
How do you know the times so exactly?

74
00:05:54.378 --> 00:05:58.398
He's on the security camera tape.

75
00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:01.538
Ah! So he did kill her, then?!

76
00:06:01.538 --> 00:06:02.818
Nope.

77
00:06:03.328 --> 00:06:09.628
After Izumi-san left...
Yes, at 8:50, the daughter stopped by.

78
00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:12.248
The victim was still alive then.

79
00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:17.168
What's more, security
personnel saw her at 9:00.

80
00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:18.248
Security personnel?

81
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:23.168
A cat snuck into the yard and
set off the security alarms.

82
00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:28.628
I contacted Izumi-san to learn
more about the victim.

83
00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:29.508
Oh, I see.

84
00:06:31.498 --> 00:06:33.978
Who is the victim, anyway?

85
00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:40.498
Kojima Ikuko. She managed a
chain of discount electronics stores.

86
00:06:40.498 --> 00:06:41.648
She was strangled to death.

87
00:06:44.318 --> 00:06:48.418
Well, now that everyone
is here, let us begin.

88
00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:49.278
Mori-kun.

89
00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:52.748
This is the victim's daughter, Chihiro-san.

90
00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:56.788
And the one who
found her, Yoshioka-san.

91
00:06:56.788 --> 00:06:58.918
Who's he?

92
00:07:01.748 --> 00:07:04.378
The great detective, Mori Kogoro.

93
00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.838
The Mori Kogoro?!

94
00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:11.308
Now, then. According
to the security video...

95
00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:17.578
Izumi-san arrived at 8:00,
and left at 8:40.

96
00:07:17.578 --> 00:07:22.998
Chihiro-san arrived at 8:50,
and left at 9:10.

97
00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:27.288
Then Yoshioka-san arrived at 9:20,
and discovered the body,

98
00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:29.988
and called the police at 9:31.

99
00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:32.578
I assume this is all correct?

100
00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.038
If it's on tape,
then of course it is.

101
00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:39.498
Her own mother just died!
Why is she...

102
00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:44.338
I take it your mother
was still alive when you left?

103
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:46.038
Of course she was!

104
00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:49.508
Or, what? Are you suggesting
I killed my mother?!

105
00:07:49.508 --> 00:07:52.628
No, no, nothing of the sort...

106
00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:58.478
Basically, that puts the time
of death between 9:10 and 9:20.

107
00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:00.438
Was the house locked?

108
00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:06.038
The front door was apparently
open when Mr. Yoshioka arrived.

109
00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:09.128
All other doors
were locked from the inside.

110
00:08:09.128 --> 00:08:14.368
Meaning the killer was one of
these three who used the front door!

111
00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:20.578
Well, time-wise, we can
probably discount Izumi-san.

112
00:08:20.878 --> 00:08:24.038
Hold on! He has a
motive for killing my mother!

113
00:08:25.498 --> 00:08:29.038
He was on the
verge of being sued by her!

114
00:08:29.038 --> 00:08:32.798
He wasted 300 million of
her money on a lousy investment!

115
00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:34.458
T-That was...

116
00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:36.058
So it was you!

117
00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:37.248
W-What?!

118
00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:42.268
I bet you pretended to leave,
and snuck in when the coast was clear!

119
00:08:42.268 --> 00:08:44.728
I don't think he's the killer.

120
00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:46.168
Conan-kun...

121
00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:50.498
If the time of death
was between 9:10 and 9:20,

122
00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:53.158
time-wise, Izumi-san
couldn't have done it.

123
00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:54.498
How's that?

124
00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:57.668
Don't you remember?
It was around 9:40...

125
00:08:57.668 --> 00:08:59.248
9:40...

126
00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:02.168
Oh, yeah!

127
00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:03.458
What is it?

128
00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:08.788
Come to think of it,
he was with us in Beika at 9:40...

129
00:09:08.788 --> 00:09:15.638
I see. It'd take at least fifty to
sixty minutes to get there by car...

130
00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:17.968
I guess he's in the clear.

131
00:09:17.968 --> 00:09:20.958
But he could've done it somehow!

132
00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.188
The lady has a point!

133
00:09:23.878 --> 00:09:30.108
But, Miss. Didn't you have a
reason of your own to kill her, too?

134
00:09:30.108 --> 00:09:31.238
Come again?!

135
00:09:31.878 --> 00:09:33.448
What do you mean?

136
00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:38.378
Her mother severed all ties
with her because of her fiance.

137
00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:41.408
Apparently, her husband
is behind bars...

138
00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:43.128
Mind your own business!

139
00:09:43.128 --> 00:09:47.128
And even if that were true,
why would I need to kill my mother?!

140
00:09:47.498 --> 00:09:52.208
I heard you asked her for a loan,
but were harshly brushed aside!

141
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:56.098
And that that fueled
a big family quarrel...

142
00:09:56.828 --> 00:10:02.518
You're the one who argued with
her and said you'd kill her someday!

143
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:04.128
W-What nonsense!

144
00:10:04.128 --> 00:10:10.628
In any case, it would appear
one of you two is the killer.

145
00:10:10.628 --> 00:10:13.278
So, what brought you
here tonight, Chihiro-san?

146
00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:17.238
I was called here.
To be lectured at.

147
00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:20.788
And that made you snap and kill her!

148
00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:22.448
Will you get serious,
you lousy detective?!

149
00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:24.458
L-Lousy?!

150
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.128
Now, now, Mori-kun!

151
00:10:26.128 --> 00:10:29.088
And what brought
you here, Yoshioka-san?

152
00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.298
A work-related meeting.

153
00:10:32.628 --> 00:10:37.718
The circumstances definitely
indicate it was one of these two...

154
00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:51.218
Here's the tape. Let me know if
you remember or notice anything.

155
00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:58.658
First, Izumi-san arrives at 8:00
on the dot and goes inside.

156
00:11:00.918 --> 00:11:03.748
And it's at 8:40
exactly that he leaves.

157
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:11.708
Next is Chihiro-san.
The time is 8:50.

158
00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:16.418
Then, ten minutes later, Ms. Ikuko
steps out to speak with the guards.

159
00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.928
I see. So the victim was
still alive at this point.

160
00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:23.268
Huh?

161
00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:26.258
What is it?
Something seems different...

162
00:11:27.878 --> 00:11:30.488
At 9:10, Chihiro-san leaves.

163
00:11:34.248 --> 00:11:39.288
Then, at 9:20, Yoshioka-san arrives.

164
00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:42.788
But as there's no
response, he looks inside...

165
00:11:42.788 --> 00:11:46.328
...and finds Ms. Ikuko dead.

166
00:11:48.288 --> 00:11:48.918
Wait!

167
00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.308
Rewind that!

168
00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:54.838
Right there!

169
00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:57.578
Say, why did you go outside?

170
00:11:57.578 --> 00:12:02.298
T-To contact the police, of course.

171
00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:06.248
Why would you go outside
when there's a phone in here?

172
00:12:06.248 --> 00:12:08.038
That is strange...

173
00:12:08.038 --> 00:12:12.628
I was in shock. So I went
to my car to get my cell phone.

174
00:12:12.628 --> 00:12:16.238
You can't blame him;
he found a dead body.

175
00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:19.128
For someone who ran out shocked,

176
00:12:19.128 --> 00:12:20.738
he did spend ten minutes in there.

177
00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:23.788
That's definitely strange.

178
00:12:23.788 --> 00:12:26.658
What did you do for those ten minutes?

179
00:12:29.168 --> 00:12:33.038
And look, he's holding something here.

180
00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.758
Care to explain, Yoshioka-san?

181
00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:40.628
Uhh...

182
00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:44.678
Report- Ozawa Detective Agency

183
00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:51.848
I see. So this shows that you
embezzled money from the company.

184
00:12:51.848 --> 00:12:55.288
I'd be ruined if
that were made public!

185
00:12:55.288 --> 00:12:57.278
So I came to talk with her...

186
00:12:57.628 --> 00:13:02.238
But that discussion
ended with you killing her!

187
00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:06.078
No! She was already
dead when I arrived!

188
00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:08.198
Like we can really believe that!

189
00:13:08.198 --> 00:13:09.998
It's the truth! But...

190
00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:11.958
...I thought if this document got out,

191
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.418
I'd be the prime suspect!

192
00:13:19.828 --> 00:13:23.998
So then you called the
police after hiding it in your car?

193
00:13:23.998 --> 00:13:24.888
That's right!

194
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:28.878
You can give us your excuses
down at the station.

195
00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.438
I didn't do it!
She really was dead!

196
00:13:34.788 --> 00:13:37.348
You gotta believe me!
I didn't do it!

197
00:13:45.418 --> 00:13:49.198
What is it? Something
isn't right about this body!

198
00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.788
She was dressed for bed,

199
00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:54.378
even though she
was expecting visitors...

200
00:13:54.378 --> 00:13:55.598
That's weird.

201
00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.248
What's weird, Ran-neechan?

202
00:13:59.248 --> 00:14:03.628
Her mouth is wide open,
but there aren't any wrinkles at all!

203
00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:13.818
That's it! This was a true death mask!

204
00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:28.727
Alright, Inspector.
We're ready to take her away.

205
00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:30.297
Alright, then.

206
00:14:30.477 --> 00:14:33.427
Oh no! It'll be too late once
the body is taken away!

207
00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:36.507
This body really is weird!

208
00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:38.467
What do you mean?

209
00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:41.927
She's in a bathrobe,
and with a face pack on.

210
00:14:41.927 --> 00:14:43.807
There's nothing unusual about that...

211
00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:45.347
It's like she was going to bed,

212
00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:46.897
even though she
was expecting company.

213
00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:50.097
That's definitely not how one
looks before having company over...

214
00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:52.857
But it was her daughter coming over...

215
00:14:53.177 --> 00:14:57.727
But Yoshioka-san was supposed
to stop by after Chihiro-san, right?

216
00:14:57.727 --> 00:15:00.867
And she was
strangled to death, right?

217
00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:01.977
Y-Yes.

218
00:15:01.977 --> 00:15:04.477
But Ran-neechan
pointed out that it's weird

219
00:15:04.477 --> 00:15:06.787
that her face pack has no wrinkles!

220
00:15:06.787 --> 00:15:08.887
Eh? Oh, yeah.

221
00:15:08.887 --> 00:15:13.257
It should have wrinkles
if she was in pain with it on.

222
00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:15.797
Check it out.

223
00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:16.767
Yes, sir.

224
00:15:23.137 --> 00:15:24.887
Which means...

225
00:15:25.097 --> 00:15:29.427
...the culprit applied the face
pack after killing the victim!

226
00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:31.727
And put her in the bathrobe...

227
00:15:31.727 --> 00:15:33.357
But what for?!

228
00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:36.817
She was dressed like this when
you were here, right, Chihiro-san?

229
00:15:36.817 --> 00:15:38.527
T-That's right.

230
00:15:39.927 --> 00:15:41.237
W-What?!

231
00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.227
I wasn't the only one!

232
00:15:43.227 --> 00:15:45.387
The security guards saw her, too!

233
00:15:45.387 --> 00:15:49.727
Y-Yes. When I came
over due to a false alarm,

234
00:15:49.727 --> 00:15:52.457
Kojima-san was
indeed dressed like this.

235
00:15:52.457 --> 00:15:56.887
In which case, why would
the killer redo her face pack?

236
00:15:56.887 --> 00:15:58.677
Did anything seem strange?

237
00:15:58.677 --> 00:16:00.437
It's hard to say...

238
00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:02.137
Are you sure it was her?

239
00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:05.307
What about her eyes, ears,
or lips, for example?

240
00:16:05.677 --> 00:16:06.887
Don't be ridiculous.

241
00:16:06.887 --> 00:16:09.097
Her face was covered
with the pack and--

242
00:16:09.517 --> 00:16:11.887
Come to think of it,

243
00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:14.227
I was surprised by
how her bright purple lips

244
00:16:14.227 --> 00:16:15.987
clashed with her white face.

245
00:16:17.587 --> 00:16:19.357
She's not wearing lipstick!

246
00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:22.317
You mean like Chihiro-san's color?

247
00:16:26.427 --> 00:16:28.447
Yes! That was the color!

248
00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:34.367
Aha! So you put the face pack
on and met with the guards!

249
00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:42.177
Being turned down for the loan
caused you to kill your own mother.

250
00:16:42.177 --> 00:16:46.337
Your first slip-up was the
malfunctioning security alarm.

251
00:16:47.127 --> 00:16:48.757
If there was no response,

252
00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:50.747
the guards would've entered the house.

253
00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:56.947
Surprised, you quickly decided
to play the role of your mother.

254
00:16:58.137 --> 00:17:01.337
With a face pack and
a robe, you could fool them.

255
00:17:01.337 --> 00:17:04.107
You are mother and daughter, after all.

256
00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:09.067
But in your rush, you met
them with your lipstick still on.

257
00:17:09.587 --> 00:17:13.477
But you had to remove
your mother's lipstick...

258
00:17:14.297 --> 00:17:16.837
Since packs are applied

259
00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:20.037
after washing the face
and removing makeup.

260
00:17:20.037 --> 00:17:25.047
Yes, I met the guards and
put the face pack on my mother!

261
00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:28.757
But she was already
dead when I got here!

262
00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:32.257
Everyone knows that
she and I constantly fought...

263
00:17:32.257 --> 00:17:36.467
I thought everyone
would think I killed her, so I...

264
00:17:37.837 --> 00:17:39.937
You have to believe me!
I didn't do it!

265
00:17:40.877 --> 00:17:43.897
There's no question that
she tried to cover things up.

266
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:47.297
But it doesn't serve as an alibi...

267
00:17:47.297 --> 00:17:50.627
All it does is change
the time of death to be--

268
00:17:50.627 --> 00:17:51.357
Change?!

269
00:17:52.007 --> 00:17:54.327
If the time of death is changed...

270
00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:58.497
What's this?

271
00:17:59.177 --> 00:18:01.387
Hey, old man Mori says...

272
00:18:01.387 --> 00:18:02.547
What now?

273
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.417
No, none at all.

274
00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:12.047
That's strange.
Why hasn't it turned up?

275
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:12.887
Could it be?!

276
00:18:16.177 --> 00:18:18.847
Umm, is it okay
for me to leave now?

277
00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:21.297
Sure. Thanks for your help.

278
00:18:21.297 --> 00:18:25.567
I'm sure we'll need to talk
to you again at some point.

279
00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:28.027
Right, I understand!

280
00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.197
Ow!
Oww!

281
00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:35.377
Conan-kun!

282
00:18:35.377 --> 00:18:38.117
Sheesh! I told you
not to hang around here!

283
00:18:38.757 --> 00:18:40.367
I-I'm sorry...

284
00:18:41.757 --> 00:18:43.957
Don't worry about it!

285
00:18:46.587 --> 00:18:47.627
I knew it!

286
00:18:48.007 --> 00:18:49.477
Well, goodbye.

287
00:18:50.677 --> 00:18:52.217
Alright!

288
00:18:55.347 --> 00:18:56.467
Here we go!

289
00:18:56.967 --> 00:18:58.047
Dad?!

290
00:19:00.837 --> 00:19:04.057
Hold on, Izumi-san.

291
00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:09.027
How can we end this play if the
main character leaves the stage?

292
00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:11.987
W-What do you mean, Mori-san?

293
00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:15.447
I finally figured out
who really killed her.

294
00:19:16.007 --> 00:19:16.837
Dad...

295
00:19:16.837 --> 00:19:19.867
But you just said that
Chihiro-san did it!

296
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:21.677
I said nothing of the sort.

297
00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:25.667
I merely exposed her cover-up.

298
00:19:26.927 --> 00:19:30.877
Her unnecessary tampering altered
the estimated time of death,

299
00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:35.797
which ironically created
an alibi for the real killer.

300
00:19:36.257 --> 00:19:37.297
The real killer?

301
00:19:37.297 --> 00:19:38.257
You don't mean...

302
00:19:38.257 --> 00:19:40.467
S-Surely you're joking?!

303
00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:45.727
You vouched that I was in Beika
when the murder took place!

304
00:19:46.007 --> 00:19:49.507
But if her testimony is true,

305
00:19:49.507 --> 00:19:53.687
then the murder
took place before 8:50.

306
00:19:53.687 --> 00:19:56.757
In other words,
you could have done it, too.

307
00:19:56.757 --> 00:20:00.157
Ridiculous! Are you saying
you believe her?!

308
00:20:00.587 --> 00:20:04.867
And what proof do you have
that I killed the woman?!

309
00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:09.127
Chihiro-san. Did your mother
have poor eyesight?

310
00:20:09.127 --> 00:20:16.047
Eh? Y-Yes. But she always wore
contacts instead of glasses.

311
00:20:16.047 --> 00:20:19.217
Please take another look
at the victim's body.

312
00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:22.217
I believe only her left contact is in.

313
00:20:24.297 --> 00:20:25.977
Only the left one is here!

314
00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:29.437
There weren't any
contacts in her belongings!

315
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.677
There's no use in looking for it.

316
00:20:31.677 --> 00:20:33.397
Because the killer has it.

317
00:20:34.587 --> 00:20:41.617
Yes. The missing contact lens
is in your pants cuff, Izumi-san!

318
00:20:44.837 --> 00:20:46.537
If you'll excuse me...

319
00:20:50.927 --> 00:20:51.837
Here it is!

320
00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:55.417
N-No way!

321
00:20:55.717 --> 00:20:58.887
That's not a place it could
just happen to wind up.

322
00:20:58.887 --> 00:21:03.507
It could only happen to someone
with direct contact with the victim--

323
00:21:03.507 --> 00:21:06.847
the killer, in other words!

324
00:21:13.177 --> 00:21:17.927
She said she was going
to sue me for all I had...

325
00:21:17.927 --> 00:21:21.697
But I only invested
how she told me...

326
00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:27.047
But the minute we lost money,
she blamed it all on me...

327
00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:32.507
Please! Anything but court!
I'll pay it back, however long it--

328
00:21:32.507 --> 00:21:35.877
I checked the land
your parents live on.

329
00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:40.547
I could postpone
things if they sold it...

330
00:21:40.547 --> 00:21:42.007
B-But--!

331
00:21:42.507 --> 00:21:44.587
I already spoke with them.

332
00:21:44.587 --> 00:21:46.967
They've agreed to do
anything to compensate me.

333
00:21:48.217 --> 00:21:51.877
Family ties are such
a wonderful thing, indeed.

334
00:21:54.257 --> 00:21:59.897
She had to pay... for dragging
my elderly parents into this...

335
00:23:35.507 --> 00:23:38.787
Good work!
You saved the day yet again!

336
00:23:39.047 --> 00:23:40.427
Oh, I see...

337
00:23:40.427 --> 00:23:44.837
The police lost a great man
when you left the force!

338
00:23:44.837 --> 00:23:46.347
Well, see you later!

339
00:23:46.347 --> 00:23:47.467
Right!

340
00:23:47.797 --> 00:23:49.257
Alright!

341
00:23:49.257 --> 00:23:51.837
Ran! Conan! Time to celebrate!

342
00:23:51.837 --> 00:23:53.177
Let's get some food on our way home!

343
00:23:53.177 --> 00:23:55.137
More ramen, I take it?

344
00:23:56.047 --> 00:23:59.687
Don't be stupid!
I'm not talking cheap food here!

345
00:23:59.687 --> 00:24:00.977
Alright!
Alright!

346
00:24:01.427 --> 00:24:04.547
We'll celebrate with pork ramen!

347
00:24:07.087 --> 00:24:10.987
I figured as much...

348
00:24:13.377 --> 00:24:14.257
That voice!

349
00:24:17.927 --> 00:24:20.497
Why is Oyama-san sitting formally?

350
00:24:20.497 --> 00:24:24.877
In other words,
one of you is the killer!

351
00:24:26.047 --> 00:24:30.007
The blood on the table...
And the tablecloth...

352
00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:33.467
Just as the dying message says,

353
00:24:34.047 --> 00:24:35.937
the killer is definitely that person!

354
00:24:36.547 --> 00:24:38.217
On the next Conan--

355
00:24:38.217 --> 00:24:41.087
"The Snowy Mountain Lodge Murder Case."

356
00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:06.195
Next Conan's Hint:

357
00:25:06.195 --> 00:25:08.236
Shoji.
