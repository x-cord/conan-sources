1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,170
Ran and I asked to accompany Pops Kogoro

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,070
have come to Beppu Hot Springs in Oita.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,070
However, Pop's real purpose was

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,270
to search for the daughter of the president of a company,

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,970
Manami Nakadai, who had disappeared.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,570
We were lucky enough to find Manami,

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,770
but when her father Mr. Nakadai,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,470
his secretary Mr. Hosogai and her fiance Mr. Ehara come to get her,

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,670
an unexpected incident occurs.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,270
Hello?

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,670
You're President Nakadai, correct?

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,170
Who's asking?

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,070
I have your daughter, Manami.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,170
What?

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,370
If you want her back safely,

16
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,470
get 100 million yen ready.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,070
Gosh!

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,270
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,770
A robbery and kidnapping case both happen at a hot spring.

21
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,070
Where is Conan's deduction headed towards?

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,270
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:03,911
"The Descent into the Hell Tour of Love (Oita Edition)"

26
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,511
This way!

27
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,611
Conan!

28
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:31,111
Are you all right?

29
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,011
Yep.

30
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,811
Ouch.

31
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:48,911
Mr. Mouri, what's this about a kidnapping?

32
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:53,011
The daughter of Nakadai Electronics Manami was kidnapped.

33
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:54,111
What?

34
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:56,511
The car that was attacked by the armed robbery case

35
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:58,811
also belonged to Nakadai Electronics!

36
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,011
What?

37
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,611
The incident occurred three weeks ago.

38
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,911
It seems that the perp knew that the cash was in that car.

39
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,311
But the car distorted from the impact of the crash

40
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,011
and the hatch wouldn't open

41
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:19,011
so fortunately, the 100 million yen was left untouched.

42
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,711
The ransom asked for this time is 100 million yen, too.

43
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,811
The target was the same Nakadai Electronics.

44
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,811
This can't be a coincidence.

45
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:30,211
It's probably the same perp.

46
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,511
Hello?

47
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:35,711
Officer Takagi, where are you now?

48
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,711
Bad news!

49
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,711
A kidnapping case took place over here, too!

50
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,111
Kidnap?

51
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,911
The daughter of the president of Nakadai Electronics was kidnapped

52
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,911
and the perp just demanded ransom.

53
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,811
-Hold it! -What?

54
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,511
The perp's appeared.

55
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,611
The perp's appeared?

56
00:04:57,211 --> 00:05:01,911
Officer Sato, don't move until I get there!

57
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,211
Officer Sato?

58
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:10,311
Don't move!

59
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,011
I'm Officer Sato of MPD.

60
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,011
I'm arresting you on charges of armed robbery!

61
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,811
Hold still!

62
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,411
You hold still.

63
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,911
What?

64
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,911
This is...

65
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,111
Could this be...

66
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:02,911
Gosh!

67
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:06,311
My beloved Officer Sato... What are you going to do to her?

68
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,711
There!

69
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,711
After them!

70
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,711
Are you also involved in a kidnapping case?

71
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,311
Shut up and drive!

72
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,911
Gosh. I won't ever let you get away!

73
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,711
Hey, where's the perp's car?

74
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,411
No good, I can't see a thing!

75
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,511
North Northwest!

76
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,711
Conan.

77
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:46,211
Pops make a left at the signal up ahead!

78
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:49,211
How come you're telling me what to do?

79
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:50,711
Actually back then, I...

80
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,111
Gosh!

81
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:58,211
Stuck a transmitter at the bottom of the bag.

82
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,811
It's Officer Takagi's rental car!

83
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,711
Officer Sato, I'll be right over!

84
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,611
Where are you headed for?

85
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:11,811
To hell.

86
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:12,811
What?

87
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,411
To Ocean Hell.

88
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,411
I'm supposed to share the 100 million,

89
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:19,511
50 each with Hiroyuki over there.

90
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:21,911
Hiroyuki?

91
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,011
Who is Hiroyuki?

92
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,711
How should I know? I've never met him.

93
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:27,811
What?

94
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,111
I was invited to join him at a dark site.

95
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,111
It seems he has a grudge against Nakadai Electronics.

96
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,311
A grudge?

97
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:37,111
Since a drone was introduced to do transporting and security,

98
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,011
he seems to have been laid off.

99
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,211
So, the same happened to you too?

100
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,011
You used to work for Nakadai Electronics, correct?

101
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,411
Shut up! Turn right over there!

102
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,511
Just as would be expected of you, Officer Sato.

103
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,611
What fantastic driving technique.

104
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:07,311
Come on, the perp will get away!

105
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,711
I won't let you get away!

106
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,511
Over to that shrine gate.

107
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,811
Come on, hurry, walk!

108
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:27,811
Stop dilly-dallying!

109
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,211
Is it you, Hiroyuki?

110
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,411
Conan?

111
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,111
Stay out of the way, brat!

112
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,711
Your plan's all over, mister.

113
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:47,211
You'd better give yourself up already!

114
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,211
What?

115
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,111
Officer Sato!

116
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,111
Officer Takagi, stay back!

117
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,611
-Oh, no! -Darn it, why you!

118
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:56,711
I'll send you all to hell!

119
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,511
Bad news! Look this way!

120
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,911
I can't see up ahead!

121
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,011
Officer Sato, hurry go!

122
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,311
Officer Takagi, get him!

123
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:17,611
Yes, madam!

124
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:23,111
The perp is Ryuji Ogikubo.

125
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:26,511
It seems he used to work for Nakadai Electronics.

126
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:28,811
Hey, where's Manami?

127
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:30,111
Where is she?

128
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,711
I don't know! Why don't you go ask Hiroyuki?

129
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,611
Hiroyuki?

130
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,111
Hiroyuki...

131
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:46,811
Is something wrong?

132
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:51,211
No, we've got to find the bag with the ransom in it.

133
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,211
These two cases...

134
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,311
Maybe are...

135
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,911
I found it!

136
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:20,411
Not inside! The ransom is gone!

137
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,911
What?

138
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:24,811
I see.

139
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,511
So, that's the story.

140
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:40,177
What's going on?

141
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:43,677
Where did Manami as well as the ransom go?

142
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,177
I don't know.

143
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:49,177
I think Manami is with the person called Hiroyuki.

144
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,877
With Hiroyuki?

145
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,877
When Manami came to Beppu,

146
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:55,777
she left a note behind, didn't she?

147
00:10:55,777 --> 00:11:00,177
Which means she left a note behind at the inn too, no?

148
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:01,677
Left a note behind?

149
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,377
Just what are you talking about?

150
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:06,177
How could she have left a note behind when she was kidnapped?

151
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:09,277
Maybe Hiroyuki told the man

152
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,877
to get rid of the note if he found one.

153
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:14,077
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:16,177
I found the daughter's note

155
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,477
so I crumpled it up and put it in my left pocket.

156
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:21,277
What?

157
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,877
Is this pocket?

158
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,877
True!

159
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:29,477
In other words, Manami wasn't kidnapped.

160
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:31,377
-What? -Not kidnapped?

161
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:35,477
Hiroyuki.

162
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,477
May I take off the blindfold already?

163
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:39,977
Go ahead.

164
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,877
Did you make this, Hiroyuki?

165
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:47,677
Right.

166
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,377
The title's Manami.

167
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,577
Why didn't you tell me about it?

168
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:57,177
The picture I sent you was an invitation.

169
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,977
This was also supposed to be part of the performance, you see.

170
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:03,377
I saw on TV that you got engaged

171
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:06,377
and figured I'd have to go this far to make you come.

172
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:09,177
I was waiting for you.

173
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:12,477
You're the one who left me alone all this time!

174
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:16,777
I wrote to you several times, but got no answer.

175
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,377
Letters? I didn't get any.

176
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,377
Just as I thought.

177
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:23,877
Hiroyuki.

178
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,377
Of course, I'm the one to blame.

179
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,577
I was so absorbed in this piece of art

180
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,077
that six months had passed in no time at all.

181
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:36,677
But I was intent on finishing it by today, our anniversary.

182
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:37,977
Anniversary?

183
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:41,377
We met a year ago today.

184
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:46,577
So, you remembered.

185
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:47,777
Yeah.

186
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:55,177
Okay, I'll take Ogikubo to the Oita Prefectural Police Department, then!

187
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:57,177
Thank you for your cooperation.

188
00:13:03,277 --> 00:13:05,477
Hello?

189
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:06,777
Manami?

190
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:11,677
"Oita Prefectural Art Museum"

191
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,277
Dad!

192
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,877
Manami!

193
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:20,877
I'm glad you're okay.

194
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:24,177
I thought you were kidnapped, you see.

195
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,877
Kidnapped?

196
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:29,277
Just what do you mean, Dad?

197
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:32,177
Mr. Mouri, will you explain?

198
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,677
Sure.

199
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:38,677
The perp of this case to begin with three weeks ago

200
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:42,377
also tried to robbed an armored vehicle of 100 million yen.

201
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:48,077
But couldn't steal the money because of an accident.

202
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,477
Isn't that right, Mr. Hosogai?

203
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,477
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:55,177
The perp used Hiroyuki's name

205
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,777
and lured Ryuji Ogikubo to become an accomplice.

206
00:13:57,777 --> 00:14:01,877
First, he was asked to rob an armored truck but failed.

207
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:05,677
Next, he made up Manami's kidnap case

208
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,177
and tried to get hold of ransom.

209
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:09,877
Doing good, Pops.

210
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,777
You're deduction's right on the ball for a change.

211
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:14,677
By the way, Mr. Hosogai,

212
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:21,977
I'll bet Manami asked you for advice in place of her busy father?

213
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,177
About Hiroyuki, too.

214
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:27,777
Yes, it's true that she asked me for advice.

215
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:30,777
I'll bet you actually wanted to marry Manami

216
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:34,577
and become a successor to the president?

217
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:37,877
Hey, what're you talking about, Pops?

218
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,677
That's why you made up that kidnapping case using Hiroyuki's name

219
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,477
as well as try to break up the engagement she had with Mr. Ehara

220
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,577
and furthermore, try to break her relation with Hiroyuki, too.

221
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:59,877
So now, let's cut out the joke.

222
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:04,077
The perps who executed the case this time

223
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:08,077
were Ogikubo and Hiroyuki his accomplice, these two men.

224
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:14,877
Hiroyuki knew to begin with where Manami was going to be staying.

225
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,877
So, he sent Ogikubo there.

226
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:22,177
He made Ogikubo watch Manami's room

227
00:15:22,177 --> 00:15:25,677
and made him send information on it.

228
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:27,477
Please understand, Hiroyuki.

229
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:30,677
I don't want to get Father worried.

230
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:34,077
What? Was my room being peeked into?

231
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:36,877
Right, by using a drone.

232
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:38,177
Drone?

233
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,577
A surveillance camera and sound collector

234
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:43,377
were also equipped on the drone that was used.

235
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:47,377
Then, maybe what I saw in my room last night was...

236
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,477
You saw two red lamps

237
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:53,777
and the reflection looked to be the horns of an ogre.

238
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,777
The sound of the waterfall is pretty loud there

239
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:58,577
so the sound of the drone is erased.

240
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:00,977
The silhouette of the branches of the pine trees overlapping each other

241
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:03,577
did indeed look like an ogre.

242
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,877
That's correct, isn't it, Conan?

243
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:10,677
Yep. That's why there were no footsteps left outside the window.

244
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,277
There were scratches on the trunk of the tree

245
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:14,977
that were left behind by the drone.

246
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,777
Ogikubo who was staying at the same inn as Manami,

247
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:24,077
got instructions from his accomplice Hiroyuki.

248
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,877
He took Manami's note away

249
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:28,777
and he also messed up the room

250
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,677
to make it look as if Manami had really been kidnapped.

251
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,977
If she were taken away by force,

252
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:36,077
she wouldn't open her brand new shoes, would she?

253
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,477
However, in that room,

254
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:41,277
an empty box of new shoes was left behind.

255
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:44,877
Isn't it because she was expecting her fiance Mr. Ehara to come?

256
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:49,377
I'm sure Manami didn't know that Mr. Ehara was coming.

257
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:51,277
You opened your brand new shoes

258
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,677
to meet with the real Hiroyuki, didn't you?

259
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:55,877
Yes!

260
00:16:55,877 --> 00:17:00,777
Manami, you have a fiance called Mr. Ehara, you know!

261
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:05,277
We got engaged because you got in the way of Hiroyuki and me!

262
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,577
I'm sure you knew that I liked Hiroyuki all the while

263
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,577
because I talked to you about him and asked you for advice, too!

264
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:13,377
Is that true, Hosogai?

265
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:16,077
What? I just...

266
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,577
Right. In this case,

267
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:22,877
you used Ogikubo to execute the crime by using Hiroyuki'name

268
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:26,577
and was manipulating everything from behind the steam.

269
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:30,777
Since you knew the relationship that Manami had with Hiroyuki very well

270
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:34,277
so you were able to predict Manami actions,

271
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:37,977
and you were able to know the transport route

272
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,877
of the 100 million yen of three weeks ago.

273
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,377
Right. It was...

274
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:46,177
none other than Nakadai Electronics secretary to president...

275
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,777
Mr. Yozo Hosogai!

276
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,477
Don't... don't be ridiculous!

277
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:55,077
Why should I want 100 million yen?

278
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:58,777
It's 50 million because you were planning to split it

279
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,877
with Ogikubo, correct?

280
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:06,377
What were you planning to use the enormous sum of 50 million for?

281
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,077
Could it have been to make up for the money

282
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:11,077
that you embezzled from the company?

283
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,877
Hosogai, is it true?

284
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,877
I...

285
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:21,877
I'm sorry!

286
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:24,177
I don't know what got into me!

287
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:27,377
Where did you put the ransom of 100 million yen?

288
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:29,277
I don't know about it!

289
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:31,477
I really don't!

290
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,177
Mr. Hosogai isn't the one who stole the 100 million yen.

291
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,077
There was a guy who took advantage of this case

292
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:41,277
and tried to snatch and run with the cash.

293
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,977
What?

294
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,277
That's...

295
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,877
Mr. Ehara.

296
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,477
Don't be ridiculous!

297
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,777
Why should I, who's making 20 billion annually,

298
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:56,577
want to steal a measly 100 million?

299
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:57,677
Mr. Ehara.

300
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:01,677
I hear business isn't going too good at your company, is it?

301
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:05,977
I hear that you rushed getting married to Manami

302
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:09,677
because you had your eyes on Mr. Nakadai's assets, no?

303
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,477
How rude of you.

304
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:14,777
On what grounds are you saying that?

305
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,977
For example, a fashionable person like you,

306
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,777
despite going to meet your fiance.

307
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:21,877
it's strange that you would wear an outfit

308
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,377
that you once wore in a gravure.

309
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:26,877
Besides, you don't seem to be wearing your wristwatch

310
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:29,677
that's worth one million yen today either.

311
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:33,377
I'll bet you sold it off for want of cash?

312
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:34,977
Don't get funny!

313
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:36,377
You're not making a criminal out of me

314
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,477
just because of my clothes and watch!

315
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,877
That's not all.

316
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:43,377
When you were waiting with the ransom in the waiting room,

317
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:44,877
Officer Takagi burst in and...

318
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:48,877
-Hold it! -There was a bit of a racket, wasn't there?

319
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,577
Over here.

320
00:19:55,077 --> 00:20:00,677
Back then, you switched the 100 million yen bills with magazines.

321
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:03,577
You're the only one who could've done that!

322
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,777
If we search under the shelf of the resting room,

323
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:10,077
I'm sure that we'll find the 100 million yen.

324
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:13,577
Where do you have proof that I did it?

325
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:16,177
If you have proof, show it to me!

326
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,777
That's the proof.

327
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:27,777
Conan, you wrote on the bills using a fluorescent marker, didn't you?

328
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:28,877
Yep!

329
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,077
If somebody touches that money,

330
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:33,377
fluorescent paint should be on that person's hands.

331
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:50,977
Hiroyuki.

332
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,277
Yes.

333
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,677
This is a splendid art object.

334
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:57,577
If we use the new bulb that we invented at our company,

335
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,977
I'm sure it would stand out even more.

336
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:01,777
Won't you let me use it?

337
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,477
Thank you.

338
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:05,177
Dad!

339
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:08,377
I'm glad.

340
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:09,777
That's great.

341
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:11,377
Yep.

342
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:17,377
What?

343
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,377
What?

344
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:42,977
"Steam Hell Kannawa Studio"

345
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:45,877
Is it ready yet?

346
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:46,977
Put them in here.

347
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:58,677
This is fantastic! This Oita steamed basket with food galore.

348
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,477
Dad, don't drink too much.

349
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:04,177
What a surprise

350
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:08,177
that Officer Takagi and Sato were here on an secret date.

351
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:12,077
Please don't tell Inspector Megure about this.

352
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:15,177
Well, you arrested the perp too,

353
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,377
so I guess Inspector Megure will overlook it this time.

354
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:21,977
He may overlook it, but I won't.

355
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:25,677
I can't ignore the fact that he played hooky on the job!

356
00:23:27,477 --> 00:23:30,377
This is what you call the real hell of steam.

357
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,277
Funny!

358
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:40,977
Beer after having solved a case sure is delicious!

359
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:42,477
Agree?

360
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:45,477
"No drinking"

361
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:48,377
I'm the one who solved the case, you know.

362
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,577
Agreed?

363
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:55,477
"Next Episode" -Come to think of it,

364
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,477
I thought something dropped when I took the shoe horn.

365
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:04,877
I think it'll do if you paste it back on with glue or something.

366
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,877
I guess we'll just have to ask the nursery school teacher

367
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:10,177
to get you a new one.

368
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:11,877
I finished making it!

369
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:13,577
Make one for me, too.

370
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:19,077
That's cherry blossom, right?

371
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:24,277
Next Conan, "Memories from Sakura Class (Ran Girl)"

372
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,520
Next Conan's Hint:

373
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,420
"Name Plate"

374
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,520
Sakura Class... How nostalgic.

375
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
True.

376
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,420
-How do you know about it, Conan? -Shoots.
