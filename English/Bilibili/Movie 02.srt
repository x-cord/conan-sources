1
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,550
Mother.

2
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,310
Don't come over, Ran.

3
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,350
It was a dream.

4
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,450
What... You dreamed that I got shot?

5
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,550
That's why you called me early in the morning?

6
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,850
I'm worried about you.

7
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,150
Lawyers have lots of enemies too.

8
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,950
You think too much, Ran.

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,750
You only had that dream because

10
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,250
you've seen too many criminal cases.

11
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,150
Anyway I'm just glad that you are fine.

12
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,650
By the way, you looked much younger

13
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,450
in my dream.

14
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,150
What are you talking about? I am still young.

15
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,650
Is that so? Sorry if that didn't sound right.

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,050
Good to hear that.

17
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,750
See you at 7 p.m. tonight.
Dad and Conan are looking forward to seeing you.

18
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,550
That kid... She still remembers that?

19
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,650
Conan.

20
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,950
What's wrong? Why did you get up so early?

21
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,750
No, nothing.

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,050
Sorry to have woken you up.

23
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,850
That's right. Tonight we'll have dinner with Ran's mother.

24
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,250
That woman is so hard to deal with.

25
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,550
(Detective Conan The Fourteenth Target)

26
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,250
I am Shinichi Kudo, a high school student and also a detective.

27
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,350
When I was at an amusement park

28
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,750
with Ran Mouri my childhood sweetheart

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I witnessed a transaction between criminal syndicates.

30
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,450
At that time I paying attention only to what's happening,

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,750
ignored that one of them had come up behind me.

32
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,050
I was forced to take a drug.

33
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,450
When I woke up,

34
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,550
my body had shrunk.

35
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,350
If they know that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

36
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,950
they'll try to kill me and even my relatives and friends.

37
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,150
So I listened to Hiroshi Agasa's advice and hid my true identity.

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,050
When Ran asked about my name

39
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,450
the name Conan Edogawa suddenly hit me.

40
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,750
In order to get more information about the people
in that organization,

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,350
I decided to stay with Ran whose father is a detective.

42
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,050
That's right he is Ran's father.

43
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,050
Now he is a very famous detective.

44
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,350
His name is Kogoro Mouri.

45
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,550
Actually he's not a good detective.

46
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,650
I guess everyone would know

47
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,150
who actually solved all the cases.

48
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,850
My secret is related to two of Hiroshi Agasa's inventions.

49
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,850
The first one is this,

50
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,850
the stun-gun wrist-watch.

51
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,450
After using the crosshairs on the lid to aim,

52
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,750
I'll push a button and shoot an anesthetic needle

53
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,750
which puts a person into sleep instantly.

54
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,850
The second one is this voice-changing bow-tie.

55
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,750
By turning the knob on the back,

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,050
I can mimic the voices of

57
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,750
elders and children.

58
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,250
And these power-assisted shoes

59
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,450
are the best items I have.

60
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,750
By using electric current and magnetic force
to stimulate the acupuncture points on my feet,

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,150
they push my muscles to their fullest potential.

62
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,750
If I need to chase after a criminal,

63
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,550
I'll use this turbo engine skateboard.

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,050
Lastly there's also this life-saving tool,

65
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,750
the elastic suspenders.

66
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,650
It stretches or shortens with a push of a button.

67
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,750
This is an excellent tool.

68
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,950
I haven't caught them yet

69
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,050
but criminal cases won't wait for me.

70
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,050
Though my body has shrunk my mind is still the same.

71
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,450
I leave no crime unsolved.

72
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,850
Only one truth will prevail!

73
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,050
Hey, Genta... are you gonna keep eating?

74
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,550
It's none of your business.

75
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,950
This is black chocolate flavored ice lolly.

76
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,450
I heard the adults all love this flavor.

77
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,650
Really?

78
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,250
How's that even possible?

79
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,350
Anyway he's so slow.

80
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,250
Check this out!

81
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,850
It says that Conan and I are meant for each other!

82
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,450
Is that machine... out of order?

83
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,850
Genta, you should say that

84
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,050
fortune-telling with poker cards is a hoax.

85
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,150
I'll do Conan's next.

86
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,350
His birthday is...

87
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,550
Hey don't ask about other people's fortune.

88
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,350
This must be about me and Conan!

89
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,450
A's prediction.

90
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,750
A~ What year is that game from?

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,050
Hey! What does A refer to?

92
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,450
A means...

93
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,150
Something before B.

94
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,050
I think it must refer to fried shrimps!

95
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,450
So it doesn't mean kissing...

96
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,650
Sorry I'm late.

97
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,850
Come on we've been waiting for so long!

98
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,150
Sorry.

99
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,350
Awesome!

100
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,950
There are so many kinds of airplanes!

101
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,650
They say there's a helicopter flight simulator here.

102
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,050
Sounds fun.

103
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,050
What a pity.

104
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,850
Why is that, Conan?

105
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,250
It says here that only the students above the fifth grade

106
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,850
could try the helicopter simulator.

107
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,650
What a bummer!

108
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,750
Sorry guys. When I was in the fifth grade,

109
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,150
I already had enough of this game.

110
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,450
Ah, then let me tell you an interesting story instead.

111
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,750
Hey! If we don't stop him now,

112
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,450
he'll tell us a long story again.

113
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,950
Leave it to me.

114
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,650
What's on the photos we just saw...

115
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,350
It's time for a quiz!

116
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,850
What's this all of a sudden?

117
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,150
Three children who were born on

118
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,050
New Year's Day April Fool's Day and Children's day

119
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,450
formed a club.

120
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,450
The question is... what was their club called?

121
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,650
The hint is that it's an animal which could fly in the sky

122
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,850
like an airplane.

123
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,850
A flying animal?

124
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,650
Conan, have you figured it out?

125
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,150
Of course! Just add their birthdays together.

126
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,350
Birthday?

127
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,950
January 1st April 1st May 5th together.

128
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,950
October 7th?

129
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,850
That's right. October 7th.

130
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,750
That's reindeer.

131
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,650
"To-na-kai". (Sounds like reindeer in Japanese)

132
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,350
Reindeer would pull Santa's sleigh

133
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,150
in the sky on Christmas.

134
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,150
Oh...

135
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,450
Correct!

136
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,350
Just as I expected Conan!

137
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,650
Isn't that Eimei Shishido?

138
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,550
He's so cool!

139
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,450
Thanks for coming.

140
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,650
Next person please.

141
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,150
All right. Here you are.

142
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,750
Thank you so much. I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Nishina.

143
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,850
I hope that you could write more delicious books in the future.

144
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,950
"Delicious" is such a nice word to describe the books.

145
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,850
Thank you.

146
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,050
He's even more handsome than his photo.

147
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,050
He's my type of guy.

148
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,350
Oh you're so shameless...

149
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,150
What a reckless driver.

150
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,150
That's...

151
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,850
It really is the model, Nana Osanai!

152
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,750
I'm not interested in that kind of person.

153
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,850
Let's have some tea.

154
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,050
When are you going to have dinner with your mother?

155
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,550
Seven o'clock.

156
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,150
You did all the planning again, right?

157
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,950
Yes.

158
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,250
You sure put in a lot of effort.

159
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,950
It has been ten years since your mom left home right?

160
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,650
Yes, she left when I was seven.

161
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,250
I remember they had a big fight.

162
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,750
They separated because they seemed to
be incompatible personality wise.

163
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,550
However not long after that,

164
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,550
your mom started to make a name for herself as a lawyer.

165
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,650
Contrary to her,

166
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,050
your dad quit his job as a police officer

167
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,850
and started a detective agency which has no clients.

168
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,750
What did you say?

169
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,250
Oh right! Your dad

170
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,850
has suddenly become a famous detective.

171
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,350
Honestly if you were not with him,

172
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,450
he would have become a ruined man long ago.

173
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,750
I don't think it would've become like that...

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,150
But it's true that my mom could take good care of herself.

175
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,650
I'm back...

176
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,450
You are back.

177
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,750
Ah! Uncle, you are still not ready?

178
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,950
He went out at noon to play mahjong

179
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,950
and just came back.

180
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,050
Come on, why do we have to eat with Eri?

181
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,750
Stop whining and hurry up.

182
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,850
Now we are with Katsuyoshi Asahi, the owner of the plaza

183
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,950
which has just opened near the Tokyo Bay today.

184
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,350
We came to his home to ask him some questions.

185
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,750
Conan.

186
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,950
I'll go get changed!

187
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,450
Sorry we're late, mom.

188
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,550
It's all right. Someone must have

189
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,550
played mahjong until very late.

190
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,450
She's still so sharp.

191
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,950
I'll have to watch what I say in front of her.

192
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,150
Good evening, Conan.

193
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,250
Good... evening.

194
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,450
Long time no see, Mr. Mouri.

195
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,750
Hey, Mr. Tsuji.

196
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,850
Who's that?

197
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,050
He's a detective.

198
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,650
Oh! You mean that famous detective?

199
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,550
Kogoro Mouri?

200
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,150
That's right. I'm Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective.

201
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,150
Oh, Mr. Tsuji, let me introduce my family.

202
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,250
This is my wife, Eri and my daughter, Ran

203
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,750
and Conan whom we took in.

204
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,250
Whom you took in... can't you use another word?

205
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,550
I'm Tsuji. Mr. Mouri and I were a team

206
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,450
when we played golf together.

207
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,550
I remember that

208
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,650
Mr. Tsuji is preparing for The U.S. Open.

209
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,450
Yeah. I've been practicing for a year

210
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,050
for that tournament.

211
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,050
This year I'm gonna win the prize!

212
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,150
I hope you can do it.

213
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,150
Anyhow I still need to relax from time to time.

214
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,150
So tomorrow I'll take them on a helicopter ride.

215
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,150
Mr. Tsuji has his own helicopter

216
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,150
and has a pilot's license.

217
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,250
Oh right. I plan on flying next Sunday too.

218
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,350
You guys could come if you are free.

219
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,350
Really?

220
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,550
That's so romantic.

221
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,650
All right!

222
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,850
Wait... I'm not familiar with the airplanes.

223
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,350
Thanks for your invitation but maybe next time.

224
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,350
Is that so? What a shame.

225
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,450
How boring.

226
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,850
He's Mr. Sawaki.

227
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,550
My parents knew him since childhood.

228
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,050
What's that grape shaped badge?

229
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,450
That's the symbol of a sommelier.

230
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,450
A sommelier is an expert of wine

231
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,150
like Mr. Sawaki.

232
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,750
And the thing around his neck is...

233
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,850
That's a tastevin,

234
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,450
a tool used for tasting the wine.

235
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,650
You sure know a lot about wine.

236
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,850
That's because I have read Mr. Nishina's book.

237
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,650
For example, red wine tastes the best when it's at room temperature

238
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,250
while white and rose wine are best when chilled.

239
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,950
You are right.

240
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,650
But it also depends on people's personal preferences.

241
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,050
That's nice.

242
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,250
Light red wines tastes better when chilled.

243
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,150
What's important is that
the cold can suppress the bitterness in the wine.

244
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,550
Is that so?

245
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,850
I guess Ran is at the age
when she's interested in this kind of things.

246
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,550
It means we've gotten older as well.

247
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,450
That's true.

248
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,550
They seem to get along well with each other, right?

249
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,850
Conan, you got food on your face.

250
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,150
It's all right...

251
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,150
Don't move.

252
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,650
A's prediction.

253
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,650
Children are so troublesome.

254
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,350
It's delicious.

255
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,650
The wine and food here

256
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,650
are as good as before.

257
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,150
Oh... you still remember?

258
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,850
When we came to this restaurant for the first time ten years ago,

259
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,950
you gave me a gift.

260
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,450
It was your favorite Ziguba chocolate.

261
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,650
We ate them in the park on the way back home.

262
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,350
Yeah.

263
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,950
Miss Towago!

264
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,250
Who's that guy?!

265
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,650
Peter Ford a TV news anchor.

266
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,250
Damn! Why is she with that guy?

267
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,650
Who's Miss Towago?

268
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,050
The mistress of a club in Ginza.

269
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,850
She sure takes care of me...

270
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,250
Excuse me, I'll take my leave.

271
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,850
It's still very early. Let's have coffee at home.

272
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,250
Sorry but I have work to do.

273
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,950
Thank you for your hospitality.

274
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,850
Mom mom!

275
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,250
Dad.

276
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,550
No... Miss Towago has left.

277
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,050
This man is hopeless.

278
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,550
Please come in.

279
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,550
Juzo Megure.

280
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,850
Juzo is his name.

281
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,550
I see.

282
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,150
Don't be silly, Genta.

283
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,650
So Inspector Megure's name is Juzo.

284
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,950
Mouri, thanks for coming by.

285
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,250
Thank you all.

286
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,850
We happened to be going out for a run together.

287
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,650
Inspector, how is your injury?

288
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,550
Fortunately, his vital organs were not hit.

289
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,550
So there's no threat to his life.

290
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,050
But he still needs to stay in the hospital.

291
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,850
Inspector, why are you still wearing your hat?

292
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,050
It's not important.

293
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,550
I bet his hair is thinning.

294
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,150
Maybe there's a hole on his head.

295
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,850
The suspect used a bird hunting crossbow.

296
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,950
We are still trying to figure out if inspector Megure was the target

297
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,550
or was he hit while passing.

298
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,150
We're investigating it from these two angles.

299
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,150
Ah Inspector, don't you have a gun with you?

300
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,250
And they still got away?

301
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,950
Why would he bring a gun while going on a jog?

302
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,450
Also even if I had a gun,

303
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,550
I'm not as good a shot as Mouri.

304
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,650
Huh? My dad is good at shooting?

305
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,550
He's one of the best in the force.

306
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,750
I didn't know he still had some skill.

307
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,850
By the way, we found something strange

308
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,650
near the place where Inspector Megure was shot.

309
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,750
It's this.

310
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,250
What is it?

311
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,850
Looks like a paper knife.

312
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,450
I seemed to have seen this somewhere.

313
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,150
Where did I see it?

314
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,850
Good morning.

315
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,050
Good morning. The brooch is nice.

316
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,250
Sensei, here's your schedule for today.

317
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,050
Also this was in the mailbox downstairs.

318
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,950
It's Ziguba.

319
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,850
It's your favorite chocolate.

320
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,850
It has to be him.

321
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,850
But it doesn't say who the sender is.

322
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,050
It's fine. I know who the culprit is.

323
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,950
Wow...

324
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,750
Water! Water!

325
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,650
Sensei!

326
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,150
How's my mom?

327
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,550
Don't worry. We cleaned her stomach in time

328
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,550
so her life is not in danger.

329
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,450
That's great.

330
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,350
Was it poison?

331
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,450
Yes. We believe it's some sort of pesticide.

332
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,950
Mom mom.

333
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,050
Ran.

334
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,350
Eri.

335
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,650
Honey, you came.

336
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,150
Are you all right, auntie?

337
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,250
Conan, you came as well. Thank you. I'm all right.

338
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,250
Just to be safe, she should stay in the hospital for observations.

339
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,350
Thank you very much.

340
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,950
First the inspector, now it's Eri.

341
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,750
Is it a coincidence?

342
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,250
Did she collapse as soon as she ate the chocolate?

343
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,550
Yes the chocolate was in the firm's mailbox.

344
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,750
Ziguba.

345
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,150
Also there's a paper flower!

346
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,750
Is it possible that they were hurt by the same person?

347
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,850
That flower. I seem to have seen it somewhere.

348
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,950
Where did I see it?

349
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,350
Why would such a cautious person like her

350
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,150
eat that chocolate?

351
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,650
Because Uncle Mouri irritated Ran's mother

352
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,450
last time when we had dinner together.

353
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,250
So she must have thought it was to make amends.

354
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,950
I see.

355
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,550
It's fixed.

356
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,050
Who would do such a thing?!

357
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,250
Professor, don't open the door!

358
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,850
Professor!

359
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,750
I'm fine. Go after him, Shinichi!

360
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,750
But...

361
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,550
Shinichi, I'm telling you to go!

362
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,150
Got it!

363
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,050
Where did he go?

364
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,150
The houses of Ayumi and Genta are on the left.

365
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,450
All right.

366
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,650
Conan.

367
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,050
A racing motorcycle?

368
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,750
What is a racing motorcycle?

369
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,350
That one! That one is a racing motorcycle!

370
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,550
- Genta.
- Conan!

371
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,950
Roger! He did turn left.

372
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,250
Conan, he made a turn by the gas station.

373
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,450
Got it! I'll take a shortcut!

374
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,950
All right! Found him!

375
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,950
I won't let you get away! I won't let you get away with this!

376
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,750
Are you all right, madam?

377
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,150
Thank you.

378
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,250
What's this?

379
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,950
So that's what it is. I get it now!

380
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,250
Playing cards?

381
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,650
Yes, the suspect is committing the crimes

382
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,950
in the order of the Face Cards.

383
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,650
The first one who got attacked was Inspector Megure.

384
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,450
His name is Juzo right?
(Juzo sounds like thirteen in Japanese.)

385
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,450
Thirteen refers to the king of spades.

386
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,950
The sword in the king's hand

387
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,050
is exactly like the one which was left at the crime scene.

388
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,250
Then it's Ran's mother Eri Kisaki.

389
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,150
Kisaki means Queen.

390
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,150
Thus the queen of spades.

391
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,250
The flower which the queen is holding

392
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,250
is just like the one with the chocolate box.

393
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,450
They are exactly the same.

394
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,250
But what does Hiroshi Agasa have to do with eleven?

395
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,650
We call him Hiroshi Agasa.

396
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,450
The word shi could be divided into the words ten and one.

397
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,550
Eleven refers to Jack of spades

398
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,450
which means the soldier.

399
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,950
That's why he has the sword-like object.

400
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,850
They are the same. You are right.

401
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,850
But why the playing cards?

402
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,650
Also why does it have to be spades?

403
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,650
The suit of spades represent death.

404
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,350
Likewise hearts represent love

405
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,250
diamonds represent money

406
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,450
and clubs represent happiness.

407
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,550
So the suspect wants to kill the people

408
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,750
whose name have the number from one to thirteen

409
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,250
in descending order?

410
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,150
Also these are people related to Uncle Mouri.

411
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,450
But who would do such a thing?

412
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,450
The only thing we know is the plate number of the motorcycle.

413
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,950
It was stolen.

414
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,350
Inspector! What are you doing here?

415
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,450
I heard that after Eri was attacked,

416
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,850
even Professor Agasa was attacked.

417
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,550
But you haven't recovered yet.

418
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,350
I already got stitches. I'm fine.

419
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,950
I heard that the suspect

420
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,350
might be Jo Murakami.

421
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,050
Jo Murakami?

422
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,050
Who's that?

423
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,450
He used to be a card dealer.

424
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,850
Ten years ago he was arrested for murder

425
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,950
and was just released a week ago.

426
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,950
A card dealer?

427
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,350
A person that passes out playing cards to gamblers.

428
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,450
This is what Jo Murakami looked like ten years ago.

429
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,950
Jo Murakami. If it really is him,

430
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,950
he does have a reason to hate me.

431
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,450
Why?

432
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,850
Because I'm the one who arrested him.

433
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,250
How could he do that? Isn't it only natural

434
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,350
for a policeman to catch a criminal?

435
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,750
You are not wrong but.

436
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,150
I've heard about that too.

437
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,550
If I'm not mistaken after he was sent to jail...

438
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,150
Shiratori! That's enough.

439
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,250
But why didn't Murakami come for me directly?

440
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,950
Since I'm the one he wants to take revenge on then...

441
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,250
Perhaps he wants you to suffer

442
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,150
and watch you in pain.

443
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,650
Does anyone you know

444
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,550
whose name have the word ten?

445
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,750
That person could be the next target!

446
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,650
Ten ten.

447
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,850
Miss Towago!

448
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,650
Welcome.

449
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,950
Mr. Mouri.

450
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,550
Miss Towago, I'm glad you are fine!

451
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,850
What do you mean? What happened?

452
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,250
Officer Shiratori what were you going to say at the hospital?

453
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,650
The thing about that Murakami.

454
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,650
I found out after doing some digging.

455
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,750
I heard from a senior officer.

456
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,750
Ten years ago Mr. Mouri who was still a junior police

457
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,650
worked with Inspector Megure

458
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,550
who was also a low-rank officer.

459
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,250
Anyway they caught Murakami together.

460
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,350
While Jo Murakami was giving his statement

461
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,550
he asked to use the restroom.

462
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,650
Mr. Mouri and Inspector Megure

463
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,550
asked another officer to take him to the restroom.

464
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,350
Then they started to smoke outside the interrogation room.

465
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,450
At that time, your mother brought you there

466
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,750
to bring some spare clothes for Mr. Mouri.

467
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,050
That's when it happened.

468
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,050
Murakami caught that officer off guard

469
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,250
and took his gun.

470
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,650
I remember now.

471
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,450
At that time.

472
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,350
Prepare a car for me!

473
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,750
Or else, I'll send this woman to hell.

474
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,750
Mom!

475
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,050
Don't come over!

476
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,650
Mouri.

477
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,350
What's wrong? You look lost.

478
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,350
It's nothing.

479
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,050
So Uncle Mouri shot Auntie Eri?

480
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,250
I had forgotten all about it.

481
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,050
That must be a terrible memory for you.

482
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,850
But... but why did my dad shoot my mom?

483
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,750
I think it's because he was confident in his ability to shoot a gun

484
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,950
and believed that he could avoid the hostage and hit the criminal.

485
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,250
But in the end, it hit your mom.

486
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,750
Opening fire when the hostage's life was at risk

487
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,350
was a serious mistake at that time.

488
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,750
Not long after that,

489
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,050
your father quit his job as an officer.

490
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,350
Hi.

491
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,050
Ran, it's been a while.

492
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,250
Shinichi.

493
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,550
I heard from Hiroshi Agasa that

494
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,950
things have turned serious.

495
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,650
It's more than just a serious matter! Where are you?

496
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,150
Can you come back right away?

497
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,050
Sorry I have a lot of things to deal with.

498
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,850
So I can't go back so soon.

499
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,550
Really?

500
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,350
Don't sound so disappointed.

501
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,550
I heard the whole story from Hiroshi Agasa and other officers.

502
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,950
I'll call you when I have some ideas.

503
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,450
If it were you, would you open fire?

504
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,650
I finally knew

505
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,850
why my mom left my dad.

506
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,250
So Uncle Mouri shot your mom.

507
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,150
He shouldn't have done that no matter how confident he was.

508
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,450
I feel that I can no longer trust my father anymore.

509
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,750
Shinichi, you wouldn't do the same thing, would you?

510
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,350
I don't know. I'm not sure.

511
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,050
Though it is a fact that Uncle Mouri shot Auntie Eri,

512
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,050
he might have another reason.

513
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,750
What do you mean? I don't understand.

514
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,450
That's all I can say for now.

515
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,150
You have to pull yourself together Ran. Bye.

516
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,750
Wait.

517
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,550
Shinichi! Shinichi!

518
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,050
Another reason...

519
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,450
Inspector, I'll go in through the emergency exit.

520
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,350
Wait, Mouri!

521
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,250
He's always full of energy when it comes to a beautiful woman.

522
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,150
Uncle Mouri still hasn't come back.

523
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,450
Also why did Murakami leave so many clues

524
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,750
that point to him?

525
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,650
Is he trying to challenge Uncle Mouri and the others?

526
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,050
But how did he find out about

527
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,050
Uncle Mouri's friends in jail?

528
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,950
He even knows about Ran's mom's favorite chocolate.

529
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,650
Hiroki Tsuji.

530
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,150
Tsuji?!

531
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,650
Hiroki Tsuji? The golf player?

532
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,050
Conan noticed it.

533
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,250
Mr. Tsuji's name has the word ten.

534
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,550
Tsuji... it does have it!

535
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,650
I called his home

536
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,850
but his family said that he went to the airport 30 minutes ago.

537
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,750
Understood. Contact him

538
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,250
and tell him not to get on the helicopter.

539
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,750
Conan, let's go over too.

540
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,850
Huh?

541
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,250
We're going, Mouri!

542
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,350
To where? Are we having breakfast?

543
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,050
Dad!

544
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,050
What are you doing here?!

545
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,350
What do you mean?

546
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,450
We were also involved in this incident.

547
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,250
I am your daughter.

548
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,850
So people around Mr. Mouri

549
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,550
were attacked one after another?

550
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,950
Yes, from thirteen to eleven.

551
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,850
So you are the next one in danger.

552
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,250
I hope you could give up flying the helicopter today.

553
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,250
I'll be fine. If you are worried about me,

554
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,150
why don't you and Mr. Mouri join me?

555
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,750
No, I don't like things that can fly.

556
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,550
May I know where you are flying to?

557
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,850
Airport Tungtu.

558
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,150
But we'll go sightseeing while we're at it.

559
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,650
When did you apply for the flight?

560
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,250
I think... I did it at the Flight Management Service
the day before yesterday.

561
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,450
Inspector, I think Murakami might be waiting at Tungtu Airport.

562
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,050
Fine, you should drive to the airport first.

563
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:21,750
Yes, sir.

564
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,750
Mouri! Just to be safe,

565
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,450
you and I will take the helicopter!

566
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,850
Ran, I understand your feelings.

567
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,850
But this is as far as you two are going.

568
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,550
But...

569
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,250
Fine.

570
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,250
Inspector, I think I should take the car with Shiratori.

571
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,550
Are you trying to run away on your own?

572
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,150
No, I never thought of that.

573
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,050
Inspector, I don't want to die!

574
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,850
We'll die together!

575
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,750
No, we are really going to die!

576
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,550
Well, I'll be on my way.

577
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,750
Conan, let's...

578
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,050
Where are you? Don't tell me?!

579
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,450
One sheep... two sheep...

580
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,350
Is that a chant which could prevent us from falling down?

581
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,650
Conan?!

582
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,950
When did you...

583
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,850
I've always wanted to

584
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,450
sit in the co-pilot seat.

585
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,550
Welcome to my helicopter.

586
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,250
We'll pass by Beika City where you live later.

587
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,350
All right!

588
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,650
There's nothing we can do. We can't turn back now.

589
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,150
If you don't listen to me, I'll throw you out the window!

590
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,350
Everything seems normal.

591
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,050
What are you looking for?
You don't always have the chance to take the helicopter.

592
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,650
You should look at the view outside.

593
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:21,950
Is something wrong?

594
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,250
Nothing.

595
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,050
You used some eye drops earlier, right?

596
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,550
Do you always do that?

597
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,450
Yes, every time when I drive or fly the helicopter.

598
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,450
We are about to reach Beika City.

599
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,950
You're right!

600
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,950
Mouri, I can see your house.

601
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,050
I don't want to look!!

602
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,850
What's the matter?

603
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,550
The sunlight is too bright for my eyes. I can't open my eyes!

604
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,550
What did you say?!!

605
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,550
Could it be... the eye drops?

606
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,650
Which means...

607
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,250
Mister, we drifting to the left!

608
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,350
Mouri, can you fly the helicopter?

609
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,850
How's that even possible?

610
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,250
It's impossible to continue flying like this.

611
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,650
Is there somewhere we can land?

612
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,050
Beika Central Primary School!

613
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,550
Okay!

614
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,450
What are you doing?

615
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,650
We are going to land the helicopter.

616
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,950
Please control the other parts!

617
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,650
You fool, are you trying to get us all killed?

618
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,850
It's fine. I practiced a lot on a flight simulator when I was a kid.

619
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,350
But you're still a kid.

620
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,050
Mr. Tsuji, the helicopter is going to crush
if things continue like this.

621
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,350
Please help me!

622
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,750
I understand. Let's give it a try.

623
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,750
Are you serious?

624
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,050
Altitude 300 feet and the speed is 40 knots. I am ready.

625
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,050
All right, here we go!

626
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,750
Altitude 200 feet and the speed is 30 knots.

627
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,250
Step on the accelerator on the right.

628
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,350
We're going straight!

629
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,450
We are 500 feet from the school!

630
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,650
Genta, Genta, can you hear me?

631
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,550
Conan.

632
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,050
A helicopter is making an emergency landing.

633
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,550
Tell everybody to leave!

634
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,750
A helicopter?

635
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,550
Everybody, run!

636
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,450
The helicopter is going to fall down!

637
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,950
I won't let that happen.

638
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,450
We're rotating left! Press the right pedal harder!

639
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,750
Be ready to land.

640
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,450
It really crashed.

641
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,150
Is Conan really in there?

642
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,750
We survived.

643
00:40:59,250 --> 00:40:59,750
Conan.

644
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,550
Are you all right, Mr. Tsuji?

645
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,850
It is leaking fuel!

646
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,450
What?

647
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,750
The helicopter exploded.

648
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,950
Aren't helicopters expensive?

649
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,650
That type of helicopter is worth at least ten million yen.

650
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,050
I can buy so many pork cutlets with that amount of money.

651
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,150
Luckily everyone's fine.

652
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,650
But Professor,

653
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,850
Conan is so unfair.

654
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,350
He flew a real helicopter.

655
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,850
You missed the point!

656
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,350
I almost died!

657
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,750
About that.

658
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,150
The eyed rops which Mr. Tsuji used is supposed to be vitamin drops

659
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,850
but was replaced with mydriatics.

660
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,550
Mydriatics?

661
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,950
It's a kind of drug which could dilate one's pupils

662
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,550
to treat pseudomyopia.

663
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,450
I see.

664
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,850
That's why Mr. Tsuji

665
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,250
found the sunlight blinding.

666
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,550
But the eye drops Mr. Tsuji put in his eyes
were used to treat glaucoma.

667
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,650
Glaucoma?

668
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,150
What's the difference?

669
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,050
The eye drops used to treat pseudomyopia
will take effect in 5 minutes and wears off quickly.

670
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,450
But the one used to treat glaucoma will take effect in 10 minutes

671
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,450
while lasting longer.

672
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,150
How long?

673
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,750
It depends on the patient's condition.

674
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,150
Usually it would last ten days to two weeks.

675
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,250
It will take that long?

676
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,850
That means the U.S Open that starts on Thursday...

677
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,550
He'll have to cancel.

678
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,950
When did the culprit replace the eyedrops?

679
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,550
About that.

680
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,150
After Mr. Tsuji pulled out of the garage,

681
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,150
he used the eyedrops in the car.

682
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,350
After that, he heard the sound of glass breaking.

683
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,550
Then he left the eyedrops on the central console

684
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,850
and went back to his house.

685
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,150
Someone seemed to have broken the glass with a stone.

686
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,650
A stone? Like what happened to Professor Agasa!

687
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,450
At that time, Mr. Tsuji thought it was just a child's prank.

688
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,250
After he told someone to clean the place, he went back to his car.

689
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,350
The one who threw the stone must be the culprit.

690
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,150
He must have replaced the eyedrops
when Mr. Tsuji went back to the house.

691
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,050
Yes, most likely.

692
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,650
Inspector,

693
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,550
it has to be Jo Murakami.

694
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,750
We found this.

695
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,850
Ten of spades.

696
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,650
Mouri, his next target is nine!

697
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,750
Do you have any friends whose name has the number 9?

698
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,450
I can't think of any.

699
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,650
But I do know someone whose name has eight.

700
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,550
Eight?

701
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,250
Kohei Sawaki.

702
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,150
His last name is Kouhei.

703
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,650
The word eight is inside the word 'Kou'.

704
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,750
All right, let's go find Mr. Sawaki.

705
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,450
So, this Murakami guy

706
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,550
attacked the people who know Mr. Mouri

707
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,950
one after another

708
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,650
in order to take his revenge on Mr. Mouri?

709
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:16,250
Yes.

710
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,650
But, Mr. Mouri, you seem pretty calm.

711
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,650
Because the number in my name is five.

712
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,050
So it'll take a while before he comes for me.

713
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,250
It's wine.

714
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,250
That's a wine cooler.

715
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,850
It keeps wine at the right temperature.

716
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,750
There are so many wines.

717
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,850
Sawaki has a plantation in his hometown.

718
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,850
At his home there, they have hundreds of bottles of wine.

719
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,250
Am I right?

720
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:52,650
Yes, it's because I'm planning to start my own business.

721
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,050
I like wine a lot too.

722
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,250
Can I take a look at those wines?

723
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,250
Please.

724
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,350
The floor is damaged.

725
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,050
I hope you are not injured. I dropped a box there a while ago.

726
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,150
Conan, you're not wearing slippers. Be careful.

727
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,850
Margaux, Lafite, Haut Brion.

728
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,850
The wines here are all of high-class.

729
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,650
Come to think of it, what's the name of it?

730
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,350
Your favourite wine. It's called Chateau...

731
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,250
You have Chateau Perse?

732
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,850
Chateau Perse?

733
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,950
The wine which Poirot drank in the movie "Death on the Nile".

734
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,350
I had one. But I drank it the other day.

735
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,750
But you said you had to wait for a few years

736
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,850
to drink it?

737
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,050
Well, I couldn't wait any longer...

738
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,150
Mr. Sawaki, let's talk about wine some other time.

739
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,950
Can you tell us about your schedule for today

740
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,050
Do you know Katsuyoshi Asahi?

741
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,250
He owned a lot of hotels in Tokyo.

742
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,950
A real businessman.

743
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,950
Mr. Asahi asked me a favor once,

744
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,350
that's when I met him.

745
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,250
I heard he's building a new entertainment plaza

746
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,850
in the Ocean Park at Tokyo Bay.

747
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:09,850
Yes. He asked me to take charge of one of the restaurants there.

748
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,950
I'll meet him at three o'clock to discuss about that.

749
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,850
Katsuyoshi Asahi.

750
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,650
Asahi.

751
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,150
Wait.

752
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,550
It's nine. The word 'Asahi' has the number nine.

753
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,250
So he's the next target.

754
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,350
But he only asked me to find his cat at that time.

755
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,450
I can't say he's a friend.

756
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,650
Maybe Murakami doesn't think so.

757
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,450
Either way, let's go to meet Mr. Asahi

758
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,450
since we're guarding Mr. Sawaki.

759
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,050
What do you say, Mr. Sawaki?

760
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,750
I'm fine with that.

761
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,950
So, Ran and Conan...

762
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,350
We are going. Conan and I are going with you.

763
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,250
Don't be kidding!

764
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,050
This is not a game!

765
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,250
That's right. People were attacked because of my dad!

766
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,350
How can I stay at home and wait for the news?

767
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,850
Ran.

768
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,750
That's the Crystal Plaza...

769
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,150
What a

770
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,950
flashy building.

771
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,050
What a reckless driver.

772
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,650
A little bit outside the line.

773
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,950
But not bad I suppose.

774
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,450
Hey! That was very dangerous, lady!

775
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,650
What?

776
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,650
Well...

777
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,650
Miss Nana, you are here.

778
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,050
Shishido, you were also invited by Mr. Asahi.

779
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,950
Excuse me, Miss, who are you?

780
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,050
Huh, you don't know me?

781
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,150
She's Nana Osanai. A model, Inspector.

782
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,850
A super model actually.

783
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,550
From the left,

784
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,550
My. Nishina, the writer,

785
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,450
Mr. Shishido, the photographer,

786
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:14,950
and...

787
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,150
I'm Peter Ford.

788
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,850
You two are with the police, right?

789
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,050
And you must be the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri.

790
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,850
Ah! You are that famous detective?

791
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,350
This is the first time I'm seeing you in the flesh.

792
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,650
Mr. Shishido, please take a photo of us.

793
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,050
Hey! Weren't you very angry with her just now?

794
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,950
This is Mr. Sawaki, a sommelier.

795
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,750
Ran who is Mr. Mouri's daughter

796
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,650
and Conan Edogawa.

797
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,050
You are the lady who asked me to write more delicious books.

798
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,650
You still remember me?

799
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:56,550
I always remember beautiful wines and ladies.

800
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,550
All right, all right.

801
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,850
Is everyone here invited by Mr. Asahi?

802
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,450
He asked to meet me at three.

803
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,150
Me too.

804
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,150
Inspector, is there anything wrong with that?

805
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,750
Actually.

806
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,450
It's almost three o'clock. Let's go.

807
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,850
You are right. Let's go to the restaurant first.

808
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,550
Hey! The four people here.

809
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,250
Do we have to take the monorail

810
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,150
to get to the Crystal Plaza?

811
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,750
There's no driver.

812
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,050
It seems that we only need to push this button.

813
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,950
The view is great.

814
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,250
Mr. Nishina, you don't like

815
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,550
things that fly too, huh?

816
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,750
No, I'm scared of the water.

817
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,450
I feel like I'm going to be drowned.

818
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,350
Oh... we all have our own fears.

819
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,950
Although it's true that Uncle Mouri shot your mom,

820
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,350
but he might have another reason.

821
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,550
Haha... it's like we are in an aquarium.

822
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,050
It truely is an underwater restaurent!

823
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,450
Wow, It's a Ferrari F40.

824
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,850
How did they get it in here?

825
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,250
Where's Mr. Asahi?

826
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,450
That's strange. The guests are all here but the host...

827
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,150
Did Murakami already...

828
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:17,950
What do you mean?

829
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,650
Did Murakami already what?

830
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,350
That's right, I need to explain this to you guys.

831
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,150
Inspector, I'll go inside to have a look.

832
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,850
I'll go with you.

833
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,450
Please do.

834
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,550
Please find a place to sit down, everyone!

835
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,150
This is the emergency exit.

836
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,250
Only this door is locked.

837
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,950
I see.

838
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,550
I didn't find anything unusual.

839
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,550
So I am the six.

840
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,250
Why?

841
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,350
Because the word 'Shishido' has the number six inside.

842
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:11,950
It does.

843
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,750
The other three people also have numbers in their names.

844
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,350
What?

845
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,750
Miss Nana, your number is seven.

846
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,750
Mr. Nishina, yours is two.

847
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,150
Mr. Ford's name sounds like four in English.

848
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,050
I see. So now we have all the numbers here

849
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,450
except for three and one.

850
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,350
Three is here too. He's right in front of you.

851
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,350
Hey! You mean.

852
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,650
My name is Ninzaburo Shiratori.

853
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,550
Nin... zaburo!

854
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,250
But we don't have the number one.

855
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:40,850
Shinichi!

856
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,450
What if the number one is for Shinichi?

857
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,750
Kuro? Are you saying that Kudo will come?

858
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,750
No, it's just an assumption.

859
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,450
That's right, if my body hadn't been shrunk,

860
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,550
I would have came out of curiosity.

861
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,250
So I am that number one.

862
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,950
I'd like to ask everyone a question just in case.

863
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,850
Does anyone of you know Jo Murakami?

864
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,350
How could I know someone like that?

865
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,850
Me neither.

866
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,950
I do.

867
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,250
Before I became a food writer, I used to write crime fictions.

868
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,150
So I did some research on Murakami's case before.

869
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:24,550
Me too. I've taken photos of Murakami

870
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,550
when I worked on an album of criminals.

871
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,850
Did anything happen at that time?

872
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,250
No.

873
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,750
Miss Nana, was there something?

874
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,550
That man was freed from prison six days ago, right?

875
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,150
Yeah.

876
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,350
Then it doesn't matter.

877
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,950
Come on... why is everybody so serious?

878
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,950
Let's not talk about this.

879
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,650
Hey, you!

880
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,850
Aren't you the one that recommended that restaurent in Paris?

881
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,150
The food at the restaurant you recommended

882
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,750
tasted terrible!

883
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,950
Do you really know what good food is?

884
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:00,450
Excuse me!

885
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,650
Of course I know.

886
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,750
Then prove it.

887
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,950
Prove it?

888
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,750
This is my gift to Mr. Asahi.

889
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,050
Can you tell me where this wine is from?

890
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,850
Are you testing me?

891
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,250
I'll take the challenge.

892
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,450
This full bodied red wine

893
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,050
tastes very smooth.

894
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,650
This is Emperor Napoleon's favorite, Chambertin.

895
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,050
This is hilarious!

896
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:43,750
How could I buy such a cheap wine as a gift?

897
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,350
Then this is...

898
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,350
You're a sommelier, right?

899
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,050
Yes...

900
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,350
Tell that tasteless man the real answer.

901
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,650
It's Monteloro Murrpan.

902
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,650
Correct!

903
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,750
How's that possible! This is Monteloro?

904
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,650
The Monteloro wines of good quality

905
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,950
will give a taste and flavor close to a Brenos

906
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,550
if perserved well.

907
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,250
You get it now, right?

908
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,350
You should stop calling yourself a gourmet.

909
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,650
Even I want to have some wine now.

910
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,450
Let's drink together.

911
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,350
I'll bring it here.

912
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:41,950
I want some beers.

913
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,050
Where's the kitchen?

914
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:43,750
Over there.

915
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,450
Kid, you should lead the way.

916
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:46,950
Okay.

917
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,350
Who are you calling a kid.

918
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,350
It's here, it's here.

919
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,850
You'll be happy to hear this, kid.

920
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:55,950
There's juice too.

921
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,450
Really, this is great.

922
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,150
Stop calling me kid.

923
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,550
Sister Ran.

924
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,450
Thanks.

925
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:09,350
Oh no.

926
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,050
Mr. Sawaki is right, it does taste great.

927
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,850
Mr. Sawaki, would you like another glass?

928
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,450
It's fine. I'll have some mineral water.

929
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,650
Thanks.

930
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,850
Uncle Mouri, you are not going to drink beer?

931
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,550
Of course not! I don't know

932
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,550
when Murakami will attack us.

933
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,350
Inspector, here you are.

934
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,550
Conan, I'm not thirsty, you can have this.

935
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,750
It's fine. I'll get another one.

936
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,950
Hey! Don't run around!

937
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:51,150
Mineral water is in the lower drawer of the fridge.

938
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,450
Ah, thanks.

939
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,050
That seasoning is rare,

940
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,450
so I thought I'd give it a try.

941
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,450
Conan, you are looking for the juice on the top level, are you?

942
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:58,950
Yes.

943
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,750
Anyway, Mr. Asahi is so slow.

944
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,650
What on earth is he doing now?

945
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,350
Huh? What happened?

946
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,450
I'm just joking.

947
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,750
Seriously.

948
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:21,750
Mr. Ford, please don't joke around at a time like this!

949
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,850
May I ask why you guys are invited here?

950
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,050
His secretary called me.

951
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,950
Mr. Asahi is a fan of mine

952
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,050
and maybe he wants to have a chat with me.

953
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,950
Perhaps he wants me to

954
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,850
advertise this place for him.

955
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,950
I also received a call from his secretary.

956
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,150
The secretary pretty much said the same thing.

957
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,750
Unlike you guys, I got a present.

958
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,950
Check this nail polish.

959
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,550
It's French and very expensive.

960
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,350
Mr. Nishina, is it the same for you?

961
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,350
Yes!

962
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,450
What are you doing, Miss Nana?

963
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,850
Painting the cork with the nail polish.

964
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,050
It's cute, isn't it?

965
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,250
What's that, a civet?

966
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,650
You're so mean. It's a cat.

967
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:10,950
Mr. Sawaki, this is for you.

968
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,550
It just fell on the ground.

969
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,550
Kohei Sawaki, I may be late.

970
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,250
Your favourite wine is on M-18 Wine Rack in the wine cellar.

971
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,250
Please bring it for everyone to drink.

972
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:29,450
The key is in the envelope by the cash register.

973
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,750
Thank you,

974
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,350
Katsuyoshi Asahi.

975
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,850
Huh? Was that note there

976
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,650
when I tried to pick the juice?

977
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,350
I want to see the wine cellar here too.

978
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,850
Me too.

979
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,050
I'd like to know what kinds of wines are there.

980
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:48,250
So, let's go together.

981
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,350
This is...

982
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:02,150
This is grand!

983
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,250
It's so cold.

984
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,450
No! This place is actually a bit hot.

985
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:11,050
Wine should be kept at a temperature between 10 to 14 degrees.

986
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,250
The temperature here is seventeen degree,

987
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,150
which means it's a bit warm here.

988
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,650
Inspector, please come here.

989
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,550
All of these are rare wines!

990
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,750
La Romanee-Conti, La Tache, Le Pin, Cote Rotie.

991
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:24,850
How amazing!

992
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,550
M-18.

993
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:29,650
Over there.

994
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:30,650
Watch out!

995
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:34,850
A short arrow.

996
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,350
Uncle! Officer!

997
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,250
It's the same thing which hit me.

998
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:43,950
Inspector!

999
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,350
The crossbow is here.

1000
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,450
Eight of spades.

1001
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,050
That means Murakami set this up

1002
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,050
and that note was also his.

1003
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,150
If so,

1004
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,850
why did Murakami skip nine

1005
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,150
and attack Sawaki who represents eight directly?

1006
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:59,750
Could it be?

1007
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:03,550
Inspector, let's leave this place first.

1008
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,650
What? It's closed?

1009
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,550
Isn't this the entrance?

1010
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,250
Yeah, it was.

1011
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,650
If we are leaving, I should grab my coat first.

1012
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,850
Go ahead.

1013
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,150
Ah...

1014
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:30,550
Mr. Asahi!

1015
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,950
The nine of spades. It has to be Murakami.

1016
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,450
Inspector, the door is controlled by computers.

1017
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,250
I can't open it.

1018
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,350
What are you talking about?!

1019
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,550
I'll call for help.

1020
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,150
No, there's no signal here.

1021
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:44,050
The phone line's been cut. Shoot!

1022
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,050
Inspector, I'll go check the emergency exit!

1023
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,350
What? It's blocked with concrete.

1024
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,350
It's all your fault!

1025
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,150
You're the one that dragged us into this!

1026
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:03,950
That's right! What are you going to do with this?

1027
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,950
If Murakami didn't change the order,

1028
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:14,350
then the next victim will be you, Miss Nana.

1029
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,050
Cut it out. Why should I be attacked by

1030
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,750
a man I don't know?

1031
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,150
But something is bothering you, right?

1032
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:23,950
Because just now you said.

1033
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,650
That man was freed from jail six days ago, right?

1034
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,650
Yes.

1035
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,550
That's not relevant to this matter.

1036
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,250
We'll decide if it is relevant or not.

1037
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,850
Please tell us.

1038
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,750
Three months ago,

1039
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:46,950
I guess so.

1040
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,450
Though I didn't hit the man,

1041
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,650
I still drove away because I was too scared.

1042
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:11,350
A motorcyclist? Was it a racing motorcycle?

1043
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,150
No, it was a normal motorcycle.

1044
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,850
Inspector, what Miss Nana said

1045
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,850
has nothing to do with this incident.

1046
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:22,050
The most important thing now is getting out of this place.

1047
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,750
You are right. Let's split up to find a way out.

1048
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,450
There has to be an exit somewhere.

1049
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,750
We'll help as well.

1050
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,550
We don't have any other choice.

1051
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:34,050
Listen! Ran and Conan, you two should stay here.

1052
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,650
Miss Nana, it's best if you don't wander around.

1053
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:37,550
Fine...

1054
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,350
They are taking a long time.

1055
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,350
Can't they find the exit?

1056
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,850
It'll be fine. They will find an exit

1057
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,950
and come back soon.

1058
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,250
I guess I should go look for it too.

1059
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,650
My dad told you to stay here.

1060
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,150
You're such a curious kid.

1061
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,150
But...

1062
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,550
It's a blackout.

1063
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,150
What happened? Why did the power went out?

1064
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,250
Fluorescent paint!

1065
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,250
Help!

1066
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,550
You shouldn't leave, Miss Nana!

1067
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,150
Could this blackout be...

1068
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,850
Ah...

1069
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,550
What?! What happened?

1070
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,750
What's wrong? Miss Nana just screamed.

1071
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,550
Inspector!

1072
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,450
Mouri, go to the power room!

1073
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:57,150
Okay!

1074
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,250
Miss Nana.

1075
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,050
This is it.

1076
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,450
Miss Nana!

1077
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:15,750
That's...

1078
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,050
Miss Nana!

1079
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:18,950
Move aside!

1080
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,050
She's dead.

1081
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,050
The Seven of Spades and the Joker.

1082
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:26,150
It's Murakami who did it. He's here

1083
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:27,750
in this building.

1084
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,250
Damn it, I'll look into it!

1085
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,050
Mr. Mouri, it's too dangerous for you to go alone!

1086
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,250
I'll go with you!

1087
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:38,250
Mr. Shishido, please stop taking pictures.

1088
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,750
Why? Now that we can't get any assistance from the outside

1089
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,150
and a coroner is nowhere to be found,

1090
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:47,950
isn't it necessary to take photos of the crime scene?

1091
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,150
You are right.

1092
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:53,250
Please hand over the photos to the police after we go out.

1093
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,750
Yeah, of course I will!

1094
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,450
But how did Murakami manage to kill her

1095
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,850
when it's pitch-black here?

1096
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,050
It's the fluorescent paint.

1097
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,550
Miss Nana's fingernails were glowing.

1098
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,750
What?! So that's what it is.

1099
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,750
The nail polish which she received had fluorescent paint inside.

1100
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,350
The middle fingernail.

1101
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,650
Inspector, something looks strange

1102
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:24,250
with the finger on her left hand.

1103
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,650
The nail polish came off.

1104
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,850
Wait! Did her nail break off?

1105
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:32,050
I think her fake nail came off.

1106
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:33,150
Fake nail?

1107
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,750
It's not her real nail.

1108
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,350
Some people would glue the designed fake nails

1109
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,050
on their real fingernails.

1110
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,550
That means the fake nail came off for some reason.

1111
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:46,950
Found it.

1112
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,350
But this seems irrelevant to this case.

1113
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,650
I suppose.

1114
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,550
Someone had left a mark on her
while grabbing her with their left hand.

1115
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,250
It seems this person was grabbing her really hard.

1116
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,850
That means the suspect is right-handed.

1117
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,550
I remember that Murakami is...

1118
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:06,850
left-handed.

1119
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,750
The culprit is not Murakami!

1120
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,850
Wait... at that time, the criminal

1121
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,950
Think, think!

1122
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,950
He used his right hand!

1123
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,350
How can this be?

1124
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,050
I made a serious mistake!

1125
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,850
Inspector, I can't find Murakami anywhere.

1126
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,650
Maybe he had already ran away.

1127
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:37,550
That's impossible! There's no way out!

1128
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,850
He has to be hiding somewhere.

1129
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:43,150
No, it's not Murakami who did it.

1130
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,950
It has to be someone here.

1131
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,350
Who is it? Who killed Miss Nana?

1132
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,350
That's right. At that time, the culprit

1133
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:55,850
kicked the juice can which I had put on the ground.

1134
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,650
The juice spilled.

1135
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,950
I remember there was at least half

1136
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,550
when I placed it on the ground.

1137
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,350
If the culprit had kicked it,

1138
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,150
the juice would have stained

1139
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,550
the culprit's trousers.

1140
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,450
The one who killed Nana is among the four of them.

1141
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,750
It's him! But why?

1142
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,750
I'm sorry, Mr. Sawaki.

1143
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,250
Mr. Asahi was killed because of me.

1144
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,250
Now you can't manage that restaurant.

1145
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,250
It's fine. I was planning to reject his offer.

1146
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,850
I also plan to quit my job at the restaurant

1147
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,650
and go back to my hometown.

1148
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,750
I am the only child

1149
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,350
and I have to take care of my parents.

1150
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:55,650
Looking at the current situation, it's best we stay put.

1151
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,450
Especially you, Mr. Shishido.

1152
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:01,150
I know. I'm the next target, right?

1153
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,650
I'll try not to get killed.

1154
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,550
Inspector, I will not die here.

1155
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,750
No matter what happens, I'm leaving this place alive.

1156
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,850
Wait, perhaphs that guy...

1157
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,150
What are you doing?

1158
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:36,550
I figured everyone would be thirsty.

1159
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:40,050
You fool! Don't run around on your own!

1160
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:43,450
We still don't know where Murakami is hiding!

1161
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:46,050
But there's no number in my name.

1162
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,040
Here you go.

1163
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:50,950
Here, Mr. Sawaki.

1164
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,450
Thank you.

1165
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,150
Kid, I'll have one!

1166
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:54,650
Okay!

1167
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:59,650
Japanese water tastes great.

1168
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:02,850
Yum!

1169
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,950
It has to be him.

1170
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,250
But I don't have any proof.

1171
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,150
Come to think of it, where's that thing?

1172
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,850
I've found it. The evidence.

1173
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,150
What happened?

1174
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,750
I think that was an explosion.

1175
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,450
Shiratori!

1176
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,350
Mr. Shishido.

1177
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,650
Protect Mr. Shishido!

1178
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,250
Yes!

1179
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:36,750
Mr. Shishido!

1180
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,650
Mr. Shishido, where are you?

1181
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:40,850
I'm here.

1182
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,250
Put it out. Are you looking to die?

1183
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,450
I am number two. So it'll be a while before my turn.

1184
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,650
Mr. Sawaki, are you all right?

1185
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58,250
I'm fine... Will I be attacked again?

1186
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,850
Well...

1187
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,850
Great! The emergency light is on!

1188
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,650
That's...!

1189
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,750
Help, help!

1190
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,950
I... I

1191
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:37,350
Hold on to this!

1192
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,950
Luckily we are alive.

1193
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,150
Ah! Where's Ran?

1194
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:51,950
Did she...

1195
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,450
Conan! Where are you going?

1196
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,950
Ran, where are you?

1197
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:08,850
Ran.

1198
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,950
Ran, it's all right. Pull yourself together.

1199
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:22,750
Shi... Shinichi.

1200
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:26,150
Conan.

1201
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,850
It's useless.

1202
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,650
That's right, I have the elastic suspenders.

1203
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,150
Shoot! My foot is stuck!

1204
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,650
No! No...

1205
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:03,650
Ran...

1206
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,150
Hey! Ran... Ran!

1207
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,250
Damn it!

1208
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:17,650
I have to hurry!

1209
01:12:58,850 --> 01:12:59,950
Hey. Ran... Ran!

1210
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:00,850
Wake up!

1211
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:08,250
Dad... dad...

1212
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,550
You have to thank Conan for this.

1213
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:14,950
Thank you, Conan.

1214
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,250
It's all right...

1215
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,650
What happened?

1216
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,650
I ripped my stitches.

1217
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:24,550
What?

1218
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,350
Look over there!

1219
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:28,950
From Six of Spades to Two of Spades.

1220
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,250
Damn it! Is he planning to kill us all at once?

1221
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,150
You've gotta be kidding me!

1222
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,850
But if things continue like this, it might really come true.

1223
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,150
After all, we can't find a way out.

1224
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:38,950
There is an exit.

1225
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,050
What?

1226
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,950
The glass windows were all broken.

1227
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:45,650
Right, we could swim against the current out to the sea.

1228
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:48,250
No, I can't...

1229
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,150
Don't give up so soon!

1230
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,550
I'll bring you with me!

1231
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,350
Kid, I'll take you.

1232
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,250
I am fine on my own.

1233
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:59,450
I'll take you with me. Can you still take it?

1234
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,650
Inspector, I'll help you.

1235
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,250
Sorry.

1236
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,350
I'll lead the way. Let's go.

1237
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,450
We're going. Now take a deep breath!

1238
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,350
Hold on tight and don't let go of my hand!

1239
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:15,650
Okay.

1240
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,450
Grab my hand!

1241
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,050
Please take care of Ran.

1242
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,050
We're saved, right?

1243
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:12,250
We are fine now.

1244
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:17,450
Nishina! Nishina! Wake up!

1245
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,550
I'll give him CPR!

1246
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,850
I'm certified to give CPR.

1247
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:25,950
Wait! Officer Shiratori should give him CPR!

1248
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,450
Do it.

1249
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,550
Huh? I didn't say anything.

1250
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,850
Hurry! Shiratori.

1251
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,050
Understood.

1252
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:47,950
Mouri?

1253
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:51,650
Officer, the person who committed all these crimes

1254
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,850
is not Murakami.

1255
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,850
What did you say?!

1256
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,250
That's because the person who shot Hiroshi Agasa

1257
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,150
and killed Miss Nana

1258
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,250
is right-handed.

1259
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,150
Right-handed?

1260
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,350
You are fine now.

1261
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:13,250
The suspect must have met Murakami some time ago.

1262
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,450
So he knew that I shot Murakami in the shoulder ten years ago

1263
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:19,050
and that he used to be a card dealer.

1264
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:22,150
The suspect used

1265
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,050
the stories he heard from Murakami.

1266
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:25,350
Used?

1267
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:29,850
Yes, he noticed that the name of the people he wanted to murder

1268
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:34,550
and his name all had numbers.

1269
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:40,050
So he put the numbers and playing cards together

1270
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:40,850
in order to

1271
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:44,850
frame everything he did on Murakami.

1272
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,950
So, he attacked Miss Eri, Hiroshi Agasa

1273
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:49,550
and me

1274
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:52,950
so that we would assume that it was all Murakami's revenge plan?

1275
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:53,950
Exactly.

1276
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:55,250
But,

1277
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,650
who does he really want to kill then?

1278
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,750
Mr. Asahi, Miss Nana,

1279
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,650
and Mr. Tsuji.

1280
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,950
Because after his eyedrops were replaced,

1281
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,050
it was very likely that he would have died.

1282
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,750
So I guess he's also a target.

1283
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,250
Mouri, so who's the culprit?

1284
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,550
The culprit is among us.

1285
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,650
What?!

1286
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:24,150
I recall Miss. Nana embarrassed you in front of us.

1287
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,450
It's not me! I didn't kill her!

1288
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:29,450
Yes! Because you were nearly killed too.

1289
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,550
The reason why the culprit blew up the restaurant

1290
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,750
was so that you would drown since you couldn't swim.

1291
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:38,150
Officer Shiratori,

1292
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,850
when you gave CPR to Mr. Nishina,

1293
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:42,950
what was your first step?

1294
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:45,050
The first step...

1295
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,450
Put his head in the right position and raised his chin

1296
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:50,550
to keep his airway clear.

1297
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,350
So, if you skipped that step

1298
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:56,850
and pretend to give him mouth-to-mouth,

1299
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:57,950
what would have happened?

1300
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:01,250
It'll get him killed, of course.

1301
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,350
Do you mean...

1302
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:08,050
Yes, the person who killed Miss Nana and Mr. Asahi

1303
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,250
and almost killed Mr. Tsuji and Mr. Nishina

1304
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,250
is Kohei Sawaki!

1305
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:14,950
That person is you!

1306
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:18,750
Mr. Mouri, I was almost shot by the arrow too!

1307
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,650
You were the one that prepared the crossbow

1308
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:24,950
after you killed Mr. Asahi

1309
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,350
here in Crystal Plaza last night.

1310
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,750
So the note on the ground?

1311
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,350
And the secretary who called us?

1312
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:35,650
It was all Mr. Sawaki's doing.

1313
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:38,350
Of course, the nail polish which contained fluorescent paint

1314
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,350
was also sent to Miss Nana by him.

1315
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:42,250
What's his motive? What is it?

1316
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:47,950
I'm afraid it has something to do with his inability to taste.

1317
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:50,450
Inability...to taste?

1318
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:55,050
It means he lost the sense of taste for food and drinks?

1319
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:58,450
Yes, his sense of taste was injured.

1320
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,650
This problem is mainly caused by stress

1321
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:09,050
or external head injuries.

1322
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,550
External head injuries?

1323
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:14,150
So the person whom Miss Nana hit was...

1324
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,150
Mr. Sawaki!

1325
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,050
Hold on a minute!

1326
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,350
You say he had lost his sense of taste.

1327
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:23,550
But he was right about the wine which Miss Nana brought.

1328
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:28,150
He got it right through the color and the aroma of the wine.

1329
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,350
How's that possible?

1330
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:32,950
Mr. Sawaki told the name of the wine

1331
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:36,150
simply by relying on his sight and smell.

1332
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:39,650
However, as a sommelier who always asked for perfection,

1333
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,350
this was something that went against his ethics.

1334
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:45,550
That's why he was going to quit his job

1335
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,250
and go back to his hometown.

1336
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,750
But before that,

1337
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,750
he wanted to take revenge on the people

1338
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,250
who caused his inability to taste.

1339
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,950
You must hate them so much

1340
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,750
that you broke the wine you saved up for your new restaurant.

1341
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,850
The one you preserved well

1342
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,850
and cherished the most.

1343
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:10,750
That's why the floor in his apartment was damaged.

1344
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:14,350
But how did you know that?

1345
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:18,150
Because I saw him tasting seasoning.

1346
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:21,750
The thing he tasted was Chili Powder,

1347
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,450
which is very spicy.

1348
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:28,050
A wine taster

1349
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:31,150
would never have anything so stimulating.

1350
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,650
I confirmed my theory about his sense of taste

1351
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:40,250
after I told Conan to bring everyone water.

1352
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,350
Water...

1353
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:45,550
Only your glass of water

1354
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,450
had salt inside.

1355
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:52,750
But I didn't notice anything and drank it up.

1356
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,350
You're right, I have lost my sense of taste.

1357
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,450
But you can't prove that

1358
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,950
I killed Miss Nana.

1359
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,250
Of course I have proof.

1360
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,950
It's in one of your pockets.

1361
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:15,650
That's the cork on which Miss Nana drew on.

1362
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:17,050
Before she died,

1363
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:20,150
she still held it in her hand.

1364
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,150
Why would that be in your pocket?

1365
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:26,750
That's because when you stabbed Miss Nana from behind

1366
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:29,350
the cork fell into your pocket

1367
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,750
when she struggled.

1368
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:35,650
That was probably when her fake nail

1369
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,950
came off.

1370
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,050
How ironic for a sommelier to have the

1371
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:43,350
cork of a wine bottle be the proof of your crime.

1372
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:46,550
There's also another proof

1373
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,050
in your pocket.

1374
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,550
The last playing card

1375
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:59,750
of a similar suit to the others, the Ace of Spades!

1376
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:02,150
Shinichi Kudo's card!

1377
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:06,750
The Ace of Spades?

1378
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:21,250
Mr. Mouri, you are totally right.

1379
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:24,250
Three months ago, after I got off work, I was almost hit by her car

1380
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:28,550
on my way home.

1381
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:33,150
Not long after that, I suddenly... couldn't taste anything.

1382
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,450
The doctor said that stress might be the cause.

1383
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:42,550
I felt hopeless and wanted to give up my career as a sommerlier.

1384
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:45,750
Then I decided to find Nana Osanai who caused the accident,

1385
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,250
Asahi, Tsuji who made me feel stressed

1386
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,750
and Nishina to exact my revenge.

1387
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,550
What did Mr. Asahi and the others do to you?

1388
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:57,850
Asahi noticed the popularity of wine

1389
01:22:57,850 --> 01:22:59,950
and purchased all the great wines from abroad

1390
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,450
using his money.

1391
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,750
But he failed to preserve them well.

1392
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:08,150
Nishina, you used the title of a gourmet

1393
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,450
and wrote those absurd books!

1394
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:12,450
Teaching your readers incorrect knowledge about wines!

1395
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:14,750
As for Hiroki Tsuji,

1396
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:19,650
he insulted my dignity as a sommelier.

1397
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,550
Four months ago,

1398
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:23,950
I attended a party which he held.

1399
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:28,650
There he is!

1400
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:32,050
A badge like this would suffice, right?

1401
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,650
And here's your tastevin.

1402
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,750
Ah, how perfect.

1403
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:46,050
You wanted to kill Mr. Tsuji over something so trivial?

1404
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,650
Trivial?!

1405
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,750
You wouldn't understand

1406
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,250
the feeling I had as a sommelier at that moment.

1407
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,550
I became a sommelier
because I dreamed of being an owner of a wine store.

1408
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,950
But my dignity, personality, and knowledge

1409
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:58,750
were all tramped on by his dirty feet!

1410
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,650
You killed Murakami, didn't you?

1411
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:06,850
Yes, on the day when Murakami was released,

1412
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,750
I ran into him on the way to Mouri Detective Agency.

1413
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,950
It was the day when Uncle Mouri went out to play mahjong.

1414
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,750
I figured Murakami would be useful,

1415
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,650
so I used the fact that
I'm Mr. Mouri's friend to invite him for a drink.

1416
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:23,950
Murakami said that he hated Mr. Mouri at that time,

1417
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,750
but he wanted to apologize to Mr. Mouri now.

1418
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,050
That's why he headed to the agency.

1419
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:29,850
It was right then

1420
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:34,450
that I came up with the plan
of using playing cards to execute my plan.

1421
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,550
It was easy to kill Murakami

1422
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,050
who was already drunk.

1423
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,650
Which means you had no grudge

1424
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,550
against Mr. Mouri and Inspector Megure, right?

1425
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:44,650
Exactly.

1426
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,150
Then why did you call Mr. Shishido and I?

1427
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:50,050
Just so you could make up the missing numbers?

1428
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:50,950
Yes.

1429
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,450
Mr. Kudo, Mr. Mouri

1430
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,550
and Officer Shiratori

1431
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:56,550
will definitely come over

1432
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,550
as long as I said I was invited by Mr. Asahi.

1433
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:03,150
I actually thought, the Ace, Shinichi Kudo would come.

1434
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:06,950
It's such a shame that he didn't make it.

1435
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,350
Innocent people would die.

1436
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,250
Have you not considered that?

1437
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:14,150
I blew up the restaurent

1438
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,250
only to kill Nishina.

1439
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:20,050
I don't care if someone else dies in the process.

1440
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,450
This place will collapse next.

1441
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,150
Since you can't find Murakmi,

1442
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:25,850
this will eventually become a cold case.

1443
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:28,950
This place will collapse?

1444
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,350
Mr. Sawaki, there's no escaping now.

1445
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:33,450
You should surrender.

1446
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:36,550
Officer Shiratori, place Mr. Sawaki under arrest!

1447
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:37,250
What?

1448
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:45,150
What happened?

1449
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,850
Crap!

1450
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:49,650
Come here!

1451
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,050
She's taken away!

1452
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:56,950
Why is Mr. Sawaki taking Ran hostage?

1453
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:59,050
What are you talking about?

1454
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,550
You just exposed the crimes he committed.

1455
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,550
Me?

1456
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:07,350
Don't move or I'll kill her!

1457
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:11,150
Damn it, how dare you use Ran when she's weak!

1458
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,450
The explosion just now

1459
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:40,250
has caused the building to lose its balance.

1460
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:42,450
Ran! Where are you?

1461
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:43,150
Over there!

1462
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,650
Where is he heading?

1463
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,750
He wants to escape using the helicopter!

1464
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:47,650
What?

1465
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:51,050
In order to escape from this place,

1466
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,650
he pretended to be the secretary and booked a helicopter!

1467
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,250
I won't let him do that!

1468
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,750
Mouri, I can take it from here.

1469
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,450
Conan!

1470
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,650
You guys, go find a place to hide!

1471
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,250
But I can't swim!

1472
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,350
Don't worry, we'll find a piece of wood to stay afloat.

1473
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,150
Hold on to me tight, I'll help you get away.

1474
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:08,750
Let's go, Shiratori!

1475
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:09,250
Yes!

1476
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:14,950
Where is he?

1477
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:15,650
On the stairs!

1478
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:18,050
Using the elevator?

1479
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,750
Mouri, this way!

1480
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:30,550
Hurry, hurry!

1481
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:47,550
Inspector Megure, how's Officer Shiratori's ability to shoot a gun?

1482
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:50,050
Same as mine. We are both pretty bad.

1483
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:00,350
What... what on earth have happened here?

1484
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:06,250
What are you doing? Bring the helicopter down!

1485
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,850
Who is that guy? Why should I give him a ride?

1486
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,550
Damn it! Why can't this elevator go to the roof?

1487
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:24,550
Hurry up and bring the helicopter down!

1488
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,550
I'm the person who asked for the helicopter!

1489
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:29,150
Emergency! Emergency!

1490
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:32,350
A man with a knife is holding a girl hostage

1491
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,050
on the helipad of Crystal Plaza.

1492
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,050
It looks like the building is crumbling!

1493
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:37,450
Please send back up.

1494
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:42,550
Ran...

1495
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:45,750
Stay away or I'll kill her!

1496
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:47,850
Don't do this, Mr. Sawaki!

1497
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:51,250
Let go of Ms. Ran or I'll shoot!

1498
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:54,650
Interesting. I dare you to shoot at me!

1499
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,950
His hands are shaking. At this rate, he'll hit Ran!

1500
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:01,750
Shiratori, don't!

1501
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,650
Inspector, are you all right?

1502
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:07,050
It's useless to escape by helicopter.

1503
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,450
Let go of Ran!

1504
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:11,850
Shut up! I'll bring her along to kill Tsuji.

1505
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,050
You want to kill Mr. Tsuji?

1506
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:15,650
He couldn't attend the U.S. Open Golf tournament.

1507
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,650
Isn't that enough for you?

1508
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:20,250
No, I'll kill him and then kill myself.

1509
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:21,850
This girl will die with me as well.

1510
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:28,650
Mr. Sa... Sawaki.

1511
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:33,850
Shinichi... Help... Shinichi.

1512
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:36,250
If he takes Ran,

1513
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,750
she'll definitely be killed.

1514
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:48,850
This is bad!

1515
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,550
Not only Ran, but everyone will be in danger!

1516
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,950
Give me the gun.

1517
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:53,150
What?

1518
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:54,850
I'm gonna cut her throat!

1519
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:02,050
Shiratori, give me your gun.

1520
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:05,050
I said, give it to me.

1521
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:07,950
Are you kidding me? I won't give it to you.

1522
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,850
What are you doing? Do it quickly!

1523
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:13,750
Okay.

1524
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,850
Kid, you bring it to me.

1525
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,350
Do you want this lady to die?

1526
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:32,650
No, how can you let a child do such a dangerous thing?

1527
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:34,450
Hey~~

1528
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,850
Make it quick!

1529
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,950
No, Conan, you can't give it to him.

1530
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:48,950
No.

1531
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:56,550
Good boy, now bring it to me.

1532
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:04,750
Hurry!

1533
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:07,150
Hurry up!

1534
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:12,450
I see. That's what it is.

1535
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,050
That's why Uncle Mouri...

1536
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,250
Shi...

1537
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:38,950
Shinichi.

1538
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,650
Damn! Hey! Stand up! Hey!

1539
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,450
That's so dangerous, Ran.

1540
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:22,650
I see. That's why Mr. Mouri fired that shot back then.

1541
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,650
He didn't shoot to arrest the criminal

1542
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:26,450
but to save the hostage.

1543
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:29,550
That's right. A hostage with an injured leg

1544
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:33,950
is a burden for the criminal.

1545
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,750
So dad was trying to save mom.

1546
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:39,450
That's the real reason.

1547
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:41,950
Dad.

1548
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:49,150
Kohei Sawaki, you are under arrest

1549
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:52,150
for murder and kidnapping!

1550
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,750
Let go of me! Let me die!

1551
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,450
I won't let you die.

1552
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:14,750
You have to know how big a mistake you have made!

1553
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:45,650
That was so close.

1554
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:48,150
Uncle Mouri, looks like your fear of riding helicopters

1555
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,350
is gone.

1556
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:58,150
Ah... put me down!

1557
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,650
Here.

1558
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:04,850
I was shocked that the gun suddenly went off.

1559
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:09,450
Gosh, luckily the bullet only grazed Ran's leg.

1560
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:12,250
If the bullet went a few inches furthur
then things would've been bad.

1561
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,950
I'm sorry.

1562
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,650
Actually, my dad taught me how to shoot

1563
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:18,650
and I've practised many times

1564
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:20,950
when we were at our Hawaiian vacation home.

1565
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:22,850
How could I miss?

1566
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:24,050
But...

1567
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:27,450
I gave Ran a bad memory.

1568
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:33,150
Inspector, this is a good chance for you to recuperate.

1569
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:34,950
That's exactly what I'll do.

1570
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,450
Ah, don't take my hat off.

1571
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:41,850
Do you think Shinichi would have shot the same way you did, Dad?

1572
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:45,450
I don't know. If he's a good shot like me,

1573
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:46,450
maybe he will.

1574
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,350
That's what I thought.

1575
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,850
Right, Shinichi?

1576
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,050
What's that?

1577
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:54,050
It's Shinichi's card, the Ace of the Spades.

1578
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:56,350
I've been holding it in my hand.

1579
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:01,350
Perhaps Shinichi was protected me secretly.

1580
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,350
Ran, the one who was saved by the Ace

1581
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:09,650
should

1582
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:11,750
be me.

1583
01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:33,450
You knew why Dad shot at you?

1584
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,550
Of course! We are a married couple after all.

1585
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:40,250
It's a husband's duty

1586
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,050
to protect his wife.

1587
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:44,450
Then why did you leave?

1588
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:49,350
That afternoon, that man

1589
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:51,950
said that the food I cooked tasted bad and didn't eat it.

1590
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:52,950
Huh?

1591
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:56,950
I endured the pain in my leg and cooked for him.

1592
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:57,950
But he was not grateful at all.

1593
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:59,350
Also, that man...

1594
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:04,250
You fool! If you had time to cook all this

1595
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,450
why not go rest and recuperate!

1596
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:07,850
That's why we separated.

1597
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:11,850
Just thinking about it angers me!

1598
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:13,650
What an unromantic fool!

1599
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:16,150
I see.

1600
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,950
It'll be impossible for them to get back together.

1601
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:22,550
Come to think of it, Mom's cooking...

1602
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:26,550
really tasted bad.
