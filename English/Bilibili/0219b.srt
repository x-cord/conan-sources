1
00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.165
What a guy!

2
00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.865
To fall onto the crowd together with the screen.

3
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.465
It's impossible to find him among that crowd.

4
00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:32.465
Yes. Megure here.

5
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.165
Hey! Megure! Are you the one who fired?

6
00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:39.265
No. I'm not the one who fired.

7
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:44.065
By the way, Inspector, didn't he leave a message with you?

8
00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:48.865
Yeah, he did. Something about a code.

9
00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.565
Code?

10
00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:01.065
This is Greek to me.

11
00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:02.665
Was a letter like this

12
00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:05.765
really carved in the center of the face of the clock?

13
00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.365
Yeah. That's it!

14
00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:10.365
At any rate, that's important evidence.

15
00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:13.665
We've got to have them postpone moving the clock tower

16
00:01:13.665 --> 00:01:16.365
until the code is deciphered.

17
00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:19.365
I don't need you to tell me that.

18
00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:23.265
Well, I guess all is well since the clock tower is safe

19
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:26.265
and his plan didn't work out.

20
00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:29.365
No, Inspector Megure.

21
00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.465
He left a code on the face of the clock

22
00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.565
and left the clock tower up to the police to take care of.

23
00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:36.165
He took the clock tower away from the hands of the owner

24
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:38.965
who was planning to have it moved.

25
00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.765
Besides, it's written in the code, see?

26
00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:43.765
You change the Katakana characters to Roman characters,

27
00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:48.265
and move the vowels one space each clockwise and read it.

28
00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:51.965
It says, "The bell will not toll for you."

29
00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:53.365
Come to think of it,

30
00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:58.465
I still haven't asked you the name of the thief.

31
00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.665
Oh, well... I guess it doesn't really matter.

32
00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:12.365
Huh? Are you waiting for somebody too?

33
00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.965
I'm going out with daddy.

34
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:17.565
But, he said he may be busy with work,

35
00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:20.465
so we might not be able to go.

36
00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:23.365
Here you go.

37
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:26.965
I'm Kaito Kurobane! Nice meeting you!

38
00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:36.565
I'm Kaito Kurobane, nice meeting you!

39
00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:38.265
Kaito!

40
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.765
I wouldn't forget, you idiot.

41
00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:51.265
Kaito. Is anything the matter?

42
00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:54.965
Thanks to your remark I just remembered something!

43
00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:57.565
The clock tower incident, when I was really in a fix.

44
00:02:57.565 --> 00:03:01.065
And, whatever became of that clock tower?

45
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:05.165
Oh, yeah, you don't know about it since you moved.

46
00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:08.365
Then, it has since been moved over after all.

47
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:15.265
Three. Two.

48
00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:16.565
One!

49
00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:22.165
This is the sound of...

50
00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:23.865
The police investigated afterwards,

51
00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:26.165
and found that the diamonds were fake,

52
00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.565
so the city bought it for a cheap price.

53
00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:31.565
Okay! Shall we get going then?

54
00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.565
His real target is the "Big Jewel".

55
00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:37.465
The jewel in the possession of the Suzuki Financial Group,

56
00:03:37.465 --> 00:03:40.065
the "Black Star"!

57
00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:43.065
Kaito, I'm not about to stop you at this point.

58
00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:46.265
But, Toichi used to always say.

59
00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:48.965
Making contact with a client is always a battlefield.

60
00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:51.065
Never be conceited, or take them lightly.

61
00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:52.765
Look into their hearts,

62
00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.165
and concentrate all your nerves to look through them.

63
00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:57.665
Give it all the skills you have,

64
00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.165
yet, keep smiling and be gracious...

65
00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:03.265
No matter what happens,

66
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:06.765
never forget putting on a poker face, right?

67
00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:08.465
Kaito.

68
00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:40.165
I'm back!

69
00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:41.965
You've got mail.

70
00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:49.865
Oh, no! What is this? It gives me the creeps.

71
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.765
What's all the fuss about, Ran?

72
00:04:51.765 --> 00:04:54.265
Well, take a look at this, see.

73
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:56.665
"Mr. Kogoro Mouri" is written in calligraphic

74
00:04:56.665 --> 00:04:58.865
white letters on a black envelope.

75
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.665
No stamp, no name of sender.

76
00:05:03.665 --> 00:05:06.165
It's probably a new type of "please join us" direct mails.

77
00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.965
I wonder.

78
00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:10.665
What is it?

79
00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:12.865
In honor of your wisdom,

80
00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:17.265
we would like to invite you to a dinner gathering.

81
00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:20.965
See, what did I tell you? Just what I thought it was.

82
00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:23.565
I'll bet they're just trying to add some class

83
00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:25.565
to their party by inviting a detective.

84
00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:27.765
I don't think so.

85
00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:31.565
See, because this fell out of the envelope,

86
00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:34.165
2,000,000 yen is written on it, right?

87
00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:36.265
2,000,000 yen?

88
00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:41.065
Wouldn't it be awfully strange to send something like this

89
00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:42.265
just for something like that?

90
00:05:42.265 --> 00:05:47.065
And, they don't even know if you're going to come or not yet.

91
00:05:47.065 --> 00:05:48.865
Hey, dad.

92
00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:52.465
Isn't the name of the sender somewhere inside?

93
00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:56.365
Now, what is this?

94
00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:59.765
The Phantom of a God Forsaken Child.

95
00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:01.865
How creepy.

96
00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:06.565
The Phantom of a God Forsaken Child...

97
00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:27.365
Be strong I say to my heart.

98
00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:29.165
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

99
00:06:29.165 --> 00:06:31.065
The curtains are raised for Detective Conan's 21st Century's episode.

100
00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.965
Six other detectives appear including Kid.

101
00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:34.565
He sees through the one and only truth.

102
00:06:34.565 --> 00:06:36.465
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

103
00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:38.765
His name is Detective Conan!

104
00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:16.065
Conan, can you check the tire over that side?

105
00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:17.965
What's wrong, dad?

106
00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:20.765
Wow! The tire on this side is super flat.

107
00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:23.365
Huh? A flat tire?

108
00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:25.765
What bummers.

109
00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:37.365
There's no spare tire! Darn it!

110
00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:39.765
-Hey, Pops. -What is it?

111
00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:41.165
See, over there.

112
00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:44.065
There's a service station over there!

113
00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.765
Wow, talk about lucky.

114
00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:50.265
A Buddha in hell indeed.

115
00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:24.365
Darn, shortcut, my foot!

116
00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:28.765
How dare that guy at the service station tell us to use this road!

117
00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:32.965
Dad, is this really the right road?

118
00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:34.065
Of course!

119
00:09:34.065 --> 00:09:35.665
He took me into his stand

120
00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:37.965
and sold this really expensive map,

121
00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:40.865
that he insisted was very explanatory of this area too!

122
00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:44.565
If this isn't the right road, he's going to pay for it!

123
00:09:50.865 --> 00:09:54.265
So, we've finally come out to a normal looking road.

124
00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:58.165
I guess he wasn't lying when he said that this was a shortcut.

125
00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:01.465
Because, see, isn't that it on the right hand side?

126
00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:05.665
The place that we're headed for.

127
00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:09.365
It sure is an eerie looking building.

128
00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:13.865
It looks more like Dracula's mansion, than Twilight Inn to me.

129
00:10:13.865 --> 00:10:16.065
Hey, dad, are we really going there?

130
00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:17.465
To a place like that.

131
00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:18.665
You idiot!

132
00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:21.865
We've got no choice after getting an invitation like that.

133
00:10:21.865 --> 00:10:25.265
There was a 2,000,000 yen stamp enclosed in the letter too besides.

134
00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:30.065
But wasn't there something eerie written by the sender?

135
00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:33.965
Oh, about the child forsaken by God thing.

136
00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:35.565
Don't worry about it.

137
00:10:35.565 --> 00:10:38.465
It's just somebody bluffing nonsense.

138
00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:40.465
I wonder.

139
00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.965
Let's not go, after all.

140
00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:49.765
We've already come this far.

141
00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:53.565
But, what if a Dracula really appears?

142
00:10:53.565 --> 00:10:56.165
Don't be ridiculous.

143
00:10:56.165 --> 00:10:59.065
There is no such thing as Dracula in Japan.

144
00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:03.165
If there is anything, it would be, a mountain witch.

145
00:11:14.365 --> 00:11:16.165
Mountain witch!

146
00:11:16.165 --> 00:11:20.765
Now, what a way to greet a woman at first meeting.

147
00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:23.365
Oh, I'm so sorry.

148
00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:26.265
What are you doing out in a place like this, granny?

149
00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:32.065
Most obviously, my cute little Fiat stalled on me.

150
00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:35.265
So, I was waiting for someone to come by.

151
00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:40.565
You folks are going to the Twilight Inn too, aren't you?

152
00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:43.565
If it's not too much trouble, would you give me a lift?

153
00:11:43.565 --> 00:11:45.265
Yes, why not?

154
00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:47.265
Go ahead and ride in the back seat.

155
00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:49.265
And, while you're at it,

156
00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:52.865
would you please move my things from my Fiat into your car?

157
00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:54.265
Oh, all right.

158
00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:55.965
Thank you so much.

159
00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:11.465
Do we have a while more to go?

160
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:12.565
Huh?

161
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.365
We've just got a little more to go,

162
00:12:14.365 --> 00:12:16.565
but, is anything wrong?

163
00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:18.565
I've got to go to the ladies room!

164
00:12:18.565 --> 00:12:19.765
Come on.

165
00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:21.165
Miss?

166
00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:22.965
I guess it's none of the business

167
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:24.965
but, the principal of the elementary school of our town

168
00:12:24.965 --> 00:12:26.965
used to always say

169
00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:28.265
that people who succeed in life,

170
00:12:28.265 --> 00:12:31.965
are those who never let an opportunity go by.

171
00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:34.065
Once you let the opportunity go by, thinking that

172
00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:36.165
the same sort of opportunity may come by again,

173
00:12:36.165 --> 00:12:40.965
no matter how long you wait for it to come by, it never will.

174
00:12:40.965 --> 00:12:43.065
Why didn't you finish what you wanted to do

175
00:12:43.065 --> 00:12:45.565
when you stopped over at the service station a while ago?

176
00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:48.765
How did you know, granny?

177
00:12:48.765 --> 00:12:52.265
That we stopped over at the service station.

178
00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:54.865
Very easy, little one.

179
00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:57.465
See, over there. The empty ashtray

180
00:12:57.465 --> 00:13:01.465
and the still new cigarette butts on the floor.

181
00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:03.065
Filling the ashtray up

182
00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:05.265
until the cigarettes fall to the floor

183
00:13:05.265 --> 00:13:07.065
goes to show that you are a heavy smoker.

184
00:13:07.065 --> 00:13:09.265
Yet, the ashtray is empty.

185
00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:10.765
The only place you could've emptied it,

186
00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:15.165
is at the service station about 10 kilometers away.

187
00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:16.765
A gentleman who is nice enough

188
00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:19.165
to give a strange old lady a lift

189
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.365
would never throw his cigarettes out of the window of his car

190
00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:24.065
in front of a young lady.

191
00:13:24.065 --> 00:13:25.965
Hey, granny.

192
00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:27.265
Who on earth are you?

193
00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:31.065
I am Furuyo Senma. A detective just like you.

194
00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:33.565
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

195
00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:34.865
Furuyo Senma.

196
00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:37.665
The famous one who solves cases

197
00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:41.065
just by listening about cases in a comfy chair.

198
00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:45.265
Come on, flattering an old lady will not get you anywhere.

199
00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:47.865
So, she's the one.

200
00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:52.165
Well then, I guess I'll keep this ashtray for now.

201
00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.165
Hey, wait!

202
00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:58.165
Even if we get to the inn, don't ever smoke in front of me.

203
00:13:58.165 --> 00:14:01.965
I hate the smoke of cigarettes.

204
00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:03.565
Darn.

205
00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:06.165
There's the Twilight In right in front of us.

206
00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:07.965
Give it all you got and step on the gas.
