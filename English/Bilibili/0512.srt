1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.840
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.140
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.140
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.640
Get to the truth of a case

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.640
that even a fortune teller cannot see through.

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.640
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.003
"Shattered Horoscope".

10
00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:10.903
The essential thing for a detective to do

11
00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:13.703
is to grasp the case objectively.

12
00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:16.003
And to be able to make logical deductions

13
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.303
without getting carried away by emotion, I guess.

14
00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:22.503
Oh, does that mean you do not believe

15
00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.103
"Reika Shijo (38)" -in things like astrology

16
00:02:24.103 --> 00:02:26.003
"Astrologist" -that I work with, Mr. Mouri?

17
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:28.503
No, that's not what I mean.

18
00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:31.003
Although it's a bit different from astrology,

19
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:36.003
the sixth sense and inspiration are needed to solve cases.

20
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:41.703
Inspiration to see through the truth of the cases intuitively that is!

21
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.703
Then, are there times that you think about fortune telling?

22
00:02:45.703 --> 00:02:48.103
Well, I guess I do at times.

23
00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.403
A whimsical publisher

24
00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:56.203
has brought together the now famous astrologist, Reika Shijio

25
00:02:56.203 --> 00:02:57.703
"Kensuke Katsuragi (45)" -and famous detective Kogoro Mouri,

26
00:02:57.703 --> 00:03:00.403
"Starry Sky Weekly's President" -for a discussion,

27
00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:03.003
so we all came to Reika Shijo's residence.

28
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:04.603
"Masao Tamura (32), Editor"

29
00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:09.003
I guess I was born with the talent to be a detective

30
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:13.003
because at times, cases are solved without my being aware.

31
00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:16.803
Oh, my. You've got to be kidding.

32
00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:22.203
Ms. Reika, you have a call from Mr. Nakame of Tohto TV.

33
00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.503
"Yuka Shiraishi (26), Reika's apperentice" -It seems to be an urgent call.

34
00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:27.403
I'm in the middle of work now,

35
00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:29.303
-later, okay? -Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:33.303
Okay, I'm going to start taking pictures!

37
00:03:34.503 --> 00:03:38.903
Mr. Mouri, you don't have to make forced smiles.

38
00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:41.503
What a lovely place.

39
00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:44.003
It used to be the villa of a certain person of financial standing

40
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:45.703
but Reika bought it from him.

41
00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:46.703
Reika?

42
00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:48.403
I mean...

43
00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:50.603
Ms. Reika.

44
00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:54.003
Stained glass.

45
00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:59.103
Yeah. Ms. Reika herself designed it and had it made.

46
00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:02.403
You can find it in various places inside this mansion.

47
00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:07.603
Her guardian star, Scorpio, is placed over her profile.

48
00:04:10.103 --> 00:04:11.403
I'll go get the door.

49
00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:15.803
Bitter!

50
00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:17.203
This tea is too strong,

51
00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:19.403
that there's practically no aroma to it!

52
00:04:19.403 --> 00:04:21.003
I... I'm sorry.

53
00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:22.603
I'll make another cup of tea right away!

54
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.303
You're...

55
00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:34.403
"Clara Midorikawa (28), Actress" -Actress Clara Midorikawa!

56
00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:36.203
I didn't know you had a guest.

57
00:04:36.203 --> 00:04:38.903
This is Detective Kogoro Mouri.

58
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.403
This is something that a publisher planned and we're having a talk.

59
00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:42.603
How do you do?

60
00:04:42.603 --> 00:04:46.303
It's an honor to get to see you.

61
00:04:46.303 --> 00:04:49.103
Ms. Reika, could I have a minute with you?

62
00:04:52.603 --> 00:04:54.203
This is the last time, don't bug me anymore!

63
00:04:54.203 --> 00:04:56.103
I've paid you more than enough, haven't I?

64
00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:58.503
Are you sure that's what you want to say?

65
00:04:58.503 --> 00:05:01.103
If I spill out what I know,

66
00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:02.703
you're finished, you know.

67
00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.803
But if things continue the way they are,

68
00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:07.903
I've got no choice but to hang myself.

69
00:05:07.903 --> 00:05:10.303
If you want to pull free of me,

70
00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:12.103
go find someone else to take your place.

71
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.403
Someone else?

72
00:05:13.403 --> 00:05:16.403
Yes, someone to take your place.

73
00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:18.303
Anyone will do.

74
00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:22.303
Anyone with money and troubled with scandals.

75
00:05:24.203 --> 00:05:27.203
Introduce someone else and you can go free.

76
00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:33.703
Who's this handsome guy?

77
00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:36.303
What're you talking about?

78
00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:40.603
Mr. Mouri, I will read your horoscope.

79
00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:43.203
I think it will only take about an hour.

80
00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:46.303
Please help yourself to some wine while you wait.

81
00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:48.803
Clara, please come to my room at 5:00.

82
00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:50.103
Okay.

83
00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:10.403
Ms. Reika!

84
00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:13.303
Oh, Ran.

85
00:06:13.303 --> 00:06:14.903
Is there anything I can do for you?

86
00:06:14.903 --> 00:06:19.403
I'd like you to give me a reading.

87
00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:22.803
That's why I begged dad to bring me along.

88
00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:27.903
It's something I'd really like to know about.

89
00:06:27.903 --> 00:06:30.603
It's something that's really bothering you, isn't it?

90
00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:31.803
Okay.

91
00:06:31.803 --> 00:06:33.203
I'll give you a reading.

92
00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:35.603
-Really? -Yes.

93
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:38.503
But I can't access the information now.

94
00:06:38.503 --> 00:06:42.803
There are many others who are waiting to be read.

95
00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:45.003
I see.

96
00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:47.803
I'll give you this instead.

97
00:06:47.803 --> 00:06:49.603
A lucky charm.

98
00:06:49.603 --> 00:06:52.103
I can't accept something so expensive!

99
00:06:52.103 --> 00:06:54.403
I'll let you keep it for me then,

100
00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:57.803
until the day that I get to tell your fortune. Okay?

101
00:06:57.803 --> 00:07:00.003
Yes!

102
00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.203
I'll try to make time for you as soon as possible.

103
00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:03.903
Thank you very much!

104
00:07:21.803 --> 00:07:23.103
That can't be!

105
00:07:24.003 --> 00:07:29.103
Didn't you promise to let me write this corner next time?

106
00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:31.803
I was planning to let you too.

107
00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:34.003
But Reika says no.

108
00:07:36.503 --> 00:07:37.503
She wants to do

109
00:07:37.503 --> 00:07:40.503
a fortune telling corner that is totally different from astrology.

110
00:07:40.503 --> 00:07:43.303
It's not that you're not good or anything like that.

111
00:07:43.303 --> 00:07:45.303
That's only a facade.

112
00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:48.203
Ms. Reika doesn't like me!

113
00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:54.903
Tres bien! (Excellent)

114
00:07:57.903 --> 00:08:00.103
What's wrong, Yuka?

115
00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:02.403
Were you scolded by Ms. Reika again?

116
00:08:05.703 --> 00:08:09.203
I feel sorry for her because she's always being scolded by Ms. Reika.

117
00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:12.803
Yuka is Ms. Reika's niece, but just because she's her niece,

118
00:08:12.803 --> 00:08:15.503
Yuka is treated like a housemaid.

119
00:08:15.503 --> 00:08:18.703
Well, I guess that's part of training too.

120
00:08:20.903 --> 00:08:22.703
Excellent!

121
00:08:34.403 --> 00:08:36.203
Yeah, it's me.

122
00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:38.503
About that special...

123
00:08:38.503 --> 00:08:41.103
Which way is the restroom?

124
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:43.603
Go left and straight ahead all the way down.

125
00:08:43.603 --> 00:08:44.803
Thanks.

126
00:08:44.803 --> 00:08:47.203
Left. Left.

127
00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:59.603
I should've played soccer with Genta and the others

128
00:08:59.603 --> 00:09:01.603
rather than come here.

129
00:09:04.303 --> 00:09:06.103
It's a red-flanked blue-tail.

130
00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:10.003
I wonder if they come all the way down here.

131
00:09:15.703 --> 00:09:17.503
How rare.

132
00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:24.003
Ms. Reika, dinner's ready.

133
00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:28.503
Ms. Reika.

134
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.603
There's no answer no matter how many times I call.

135
00:09:32.603 --> 00:09:34.703
Maybe she's asleep.

136
00:09:34.703 --> 00:09:40.203
She's not the type to keep her customers waiting though.

137
00:09:40.203 --> 00:09:41.503
Let's go see!

138
00:09:41.503 --> 00:09:43.903
Mr. Mouri, will you please come with me?

139
00:09:43.903 --> 00:09:46.203
Okay, if you want me to.

140
00:09:48.503 --> 00:09:50.403
Ms. Reika! Ms. Reika!

141
00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:53.303
Reika, is anything the matter?

142
00:09:53.303 --> 00:09:55.003
The door's locked!

143
00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:58.303
This is strange. Maybe there's something wrong.

144
00:09:58.303 --> 00:09:59.903
Let's go check from the veranda.

145
00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:00.903
Okay.

146
00:10:12.103 --> 00:10:14.603
Reika! What's wrong? Reika!

147
00:10:16.403 --> 00:10:17.403
No good!

148
00:10:17.403 --> 00:10:20.103
Right, maybe we can crack the skylight.

149
00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:21.903
I'll climb up there.

150
00:10:21.903 --> 00:10:24.403
Will you hold the door for me, Mr. Tamura?

151
00:10:24.403 --> 00:10:25.403
Yes, sir!

152
00:10:26.503 --> 00:10:29.303
Please unlock the door as soon as you get inside!

153
00:10:31.203 --> 00:10:32.703
Hold on, Reika.

154
00:10:55.703 --> 00:10:58.403
Reika...

155
00:10:58.403 --> 00:11:00.603
Please open your eyes, Reika!

156
00:11:00.603 --> 00:11:04.703
The only way in and out of the room was locked.

157
00:11:04.703 --> 00:11:07.503
The window is a non-opening window.

158
00:11:07.503 --> 00:11:09.903
In other words, this is...

159
00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:12.003
a locked door murder!

160
00:11:26.356 --> 00:11:30.956
The victim is Ms. Reika Shijo, an astrologist.

161
00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:35.456
It looks like she's been dead between three to three and a half hours.

162
00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:36.656
The estimated time of the murder

163
00:11:36.656 --> 00:11:39.256
is probably some time a little before or after 17:00.

164
00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:42.456
You went in by cracking the skylight

165
00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:45.356
because the door was locked?

166
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:47.956
And where was the key found?

167
00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:49.956
It was on the floor around there.

168
00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:53.656
Mr. Katsuragi picked it up and opened the door.

169
00:11:53.656 --> 00:11:55.556
Do you have a spare key?

170
00:11:55.556 --> 00:11:59.056
Yuka, her disciple may have the key.

171
00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.556
A bird feather is on the floor.

172
00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:09.756
The feather of a red-flanked blue-tail!

173
00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:13.756
I saw it on the roof about 5:30!

174
00:12:13.756 --> 00:12:16.756
If the feather back then fell from the cracked skylight,

175
00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:20.056
isn't it strange that it's underneath the shattered glass?

176
00:12:20.056 --> 00:12:21.656
Hey!

177
00:12:21.656 --> 00:12:24.656
Don't go here and there on your own at the site of the murder!

178
00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:25.956
Ms. Shiraishi.

179
00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:29.256
Do you have the spare key to Reika's room?

180
00:12:29.256 --> 00:12:30.456
No.

181
00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:35.156
The key that Ms. Reika had was the only key to that room.

182
00:12:35.156 --> 00:12:38.956
Yuka, being as near to her as you usually were,

183
00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:43.356
wouldn't it have been quite easy for you to make a spare key?

184
00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:44.456
Why would I?

185
00:12:44.456 --> 00:12:45.956
Don't tell me

186
00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:47.656
that you held a grudge against Ms. Reika

187
00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:50.456
because she was against you writing a fortunetelling section in a magazine.

188
00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:52.456
No way!

189
00:12:52.456 --> 00:12:54.556
Now that Ms. Reika is passed on,

190
00:12:54.556 --> 00:13:00.156
you'd be her only bereaved family, inheriting her entire estate.

191
00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:01.656
I see.

192
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.656
The killer is you, Yuka!

193
00:13:04.656 --> 00:13:05.656
What?

194
00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:08.956
You secretly made a spare key and...

195
00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:11.656
Inspector, we got a verification as to the spare key.

196
00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:15.556
-And? -Yes, sir.

197
00:13:15.556 --> 00:13:18.756
This is a special type of key called dimple key

198
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:22.556
and only the manufacturer of this key is able to make a spare.

199
00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:23.656
Moreover,

200
00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:26.656
when you make a spare you've got to get credit card authorization too.

201
00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:29.756
That's why it would be almost impossible for anybody but the victim

202
00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:32.056
to make a spare key.

203
00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:33.956
We confirmed with the manufacturer

204
00:13:33.956 --> 00:13:35.956
that this is the one and only key to her room.

205
00:13:35.956 --> 00:13:37.856
No... no way.

206
00:13:37.856 --> 00:13:40.556
If so, this case is quite complicated.

207
00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:44.956
Yes, since the only key there is was inside the room.

208
00:13:44.956 --> 00:13:47.156
A locked room murder case.

209
00:13:47.156 --> 00:13:50.256
Hold on! What if Mr. Katsuragi switched keys

210
00:13:50.256 --> 00:13:54.356
from the one he had hidden to the real one when he unlocked the door?

211
00:13:54.356 --> 00:13:56.156
What a thing to say.

212
00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:59.156
No, I was watching him from beginning to end,

213
00:13:59.156 --> 00:14:01.056
but he did no such thing.

214
00:14:01.056 --> 00:14:04.156
Right. I was watching too.

215
00:14:04.156 --> 00:14:05.556
Ms. Shiraishi.

216
00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:09.056
When did you last see Reika?

217
00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:10.856
When she left the living room

218
00:14:10.856 --> 00:14:13.156
and headed to her workshop.

219
00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.956
Where were you after that?

220
00:14:14.956 --> 00:14:17.856
After talking to Mr. Katsuragi for two to three minutes,

221
00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.656
I was in the kitchen right through.

222
00:14:19.656 --> 00:14:25.756
I was in the kitchen all the while, helping her make dinner.

223
00:14:25.756 --> 00:14:27.856
And you, Mr. Tamura?

224
00:14:27.856 --> 00:14:29.956
The same as Yuka.

225
00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:33.356
After that, I was with Mr. Mouri in the living room right through.

226
00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:34.956
And you, Mr. Katsuragi?

227
00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:36.456
The same with me.

228
00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:39.756
I made a business call from the guest room,

229
00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:44.056
and from after 17:00, I was here talking to Mr. Mouri and Mr. Tamura.

230
00:14:45.256 --> 00:14:47.156
What about you, Ms. Midorikawa?

231
00:14:47.156 --> 00:14:50.656
The... the same as everyone else.

232
00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:54.056
Come to think of it, when I went to the restroom at about 5:00,

233
00:14:54.056 --> 00:14:56.656
you came down from the second floor, didn't you?

234
00:14:56.656 --> 00:15:00.956
That's because I had an appointment to have my fortune told at that time!

235
00:15:00.956 --> 00:15:03.656
Don't tell me that you, Clara, killed Ms. Reika at that time.

236
00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:05.656
Don't be ridiculous!

237
00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:07.756
Why would I killed her?

238
00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:09.356
Clara.

239
00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:13.756
When I came here last month on business,

240
00:15:13.756 --> 00:15:17.256
I saw you come out of Ms. Reika's room.

241
00:15:17.256 --> 00:15:20.356
I'll kill that woman one day!

242
00:15:21.656 --> 00:15:24.456
Kill her? Why on earth?

243
00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:26.756
Reika is an ugly woman!

244
00:15:26.756 --> 00:15:29.856
At first, she approaches you like she's a nice person,

245
00:15:29.856 --> 00:15:32.756
then she pries into your privacy, saying that it's for fortunetelling.

246
00:15:32.756 --> 00:15:35.756
After she gets hold of your weak points,

247
00:15:35.756 --> 00:15:37.456
she turns into a devil

248
00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:40.756
demanding a large sum of money for the reading!

249
00:15:41.756 --> 00:15:43.356
I tried to break off all ties with her,

250
00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:45.856
but she threatened to leak my private information to the media.

251
00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:48.656
I see. She threatened you.

252
00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.656
So, you were cornered into killing Reika.

253
00:15:51.656 --> 00:15:52.956
No!

254
00:15:52.956 --> 00:15:54.456
I went up to her room but...

255
00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:59.756
I'm in the middle of work now. Later, okay?

256
00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:04.456
That's why I came back without going inside!

257
00:16:04.456 --> 00:16:06.356
Can you prove it?

258
00:16:06.356 --> 00:16:08.456
Well, I don't know how...

259
00:16:15.656 --> 00:16:17.556
Conan.

260
00:16:17.556 --> 00:16:19.656
Ran.

261
00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:22.156
I thought she was a kind person,

262
00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:24.756
and I didn't think she'd threaten anyone.

263
00:16:24.756 --> 00:16:27.856
I wanted her to give me a reading,

264
00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:30.156
but she told me that she couldn't do so right away

265
00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.556
and gave me this.

266
00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:32.956
She told me it was a lucky charm.

267
00:16:32.956 --> 00:16:35.756
She had it on the key holder that her key was on.

268
00:16:35.756 --> 00:16:37.656
What's that?

269
00:16:37.656 --> 00:16:39.456
She gave it to me before I went into her room

270
00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:41.456
to ask her to give me a reading on dad.

271
00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:43.056
That's...

272
00:16:44.456 --> 00:16:48.556
"I'm in the middle of work now. Later, okay?"

273
00:16:48.556 --> 00:16:50.756
The remark sure sounds familiar.

274
00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:55.556
The skylight was made with the same thing as this.

275
00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:03.356
This is...

276
00:17:06.456 --> 00:17:08.856
I get it. That's the story!

277
00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:10.356
At any rate, everyone,

278
00:17:10.356 --> 00:17:11.756
I know it's troublesome,

279
00:17:11.756 --> 00:17:13.656
but I would like you all to come to the station

280
00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:16.156
and give us the details.

281
00:17:16.156 --> 00:17:17.856
-Oh, no. -Okay.

282
00:17:20.156 --> 00:17:22.856
The wine's getting to me only now.

283
00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:27.956
Please wait, Inspector.

284
00:17:27.956 --> 00:17:30.956
The only one you need to take to the station is the murderer.

285
00:17:30.956 --> 00:17:34.956
What? Then, have you figured out who the murderer is?

286
00:17:34.956 --> 00:17:36.156
Of course!

287
00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:41.156
The locked room trick is not all that difficult.

288
00:17:41.156 --> 00:17:43.756
The person who killed Reika

289
00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:45.756
walked out of the room with the key

290
00:17:45.756 --> 00:17:48.356
and locked the door.

291
00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:50.356
He then, climbed the roof

292
00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:53.456
and cracked part of the stained glass, opened a hole in it

293
00:17:53.456 --> 00:17:56.356
and dropped the key inside from there.

294
00:17:59.956 --> 00:18:03.656
The feather of the red-flanked blue-tail that Conan saw at around 5:30

295
00:18:03.656 --> 00:18:06.956
dropped into the room from the hole that the killer made.

296
00:18:06.956 --> 00:18:11.156
That's why it was underneath the shattered piece of glass.

297
00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.456
As proof of that,

298
00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:16.956
there are no shattered pieces of red pieces of glass.

299
00:18:16.956 --> 00:18:18.056
That is,

300
00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.856
there are no pieces of glass that are part of the Antares of Scorpio.

301
00:18:20.856 --> 00:18:22.956
But why did the murderer

302
00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:25.556
go as far as to commit a locked room murder?

303
00:18:25.556 --> 00:18:28.556
In order to make a scapegoat of Yuka.

304
00:18:29.656 --> 00:18:34.656
The murderer probably thought that Yuka had a spare key.

305
00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:37.556
But since no such key existed,

306
00:18:37.556 --> 00:18:40.156
it turned out to be a locked room murder case.

307
00:18:40.156 --> 00:18:41.656
I see.

308
00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:44.756
If so, then the murderer is Ms. Clara Midorikawa after all.

309
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:45.756
No!

310
00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:47.256
No.

311
00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:49.556
When Clara went to the room,

312
00:18:49.556 --> 00:18:52.456
Reika was already killed.

313
00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:53.556
What?

314
00:18:53.556 --> 00:18:56.156
But I'm sure that I heard her voice!

315
00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:57.356
Mr. Tamura.

316
00:18:57.356 --> 00:19:01.056
You recorded me talking to Reika, didn't you?

317
00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.056
Yes.

318
00:19:02.056 --> 00:19:04.856
There was a phone call part way through the talk, wasn't there?

319
00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:07.956
Could we listen to that part of the conversation?

320
00:19:07.956 --> 00:19:09.256
Sure.

321
00:19:11.656 --> 00:19:14.556
It seems to be an urgent call.

322
00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:16.256
I'm in the middle of work now.

323
00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:17.356
Later, okay?

324
00:19:19.756 --> 00:19:22.756
Ms. Reika, it's me, Clara Midorikawa.

325
00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:26.956
I'm working now.

326
00:19:26.956 --> 00:19:28.656
Later, okay?

327
00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:32.456
Which mean that the murderer is Mr. Tamura since he has a recorder.

328
00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:33.856
No way!

329
00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:38.656
Anybody can have a recorder hidden in his pocket.

330
00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:41.156
Right, Mr. Katsuragi?

331
00:19:41.156 --> 00:19:43.056
What the?

332
00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:46.356
The one who killed Reika is...

333
00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:48.756
you, Mr. Katsuragi!

334
00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:54.156
Don't be ridiculous!

335
00:19:54.156 --> 00:19:55.756
You mentioned a while ago

336
00:19:55.756 --> 00:19:59.956
that maybe Yuka had the spare key to the room.

337
00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:03.256
If so, why didn't you call her

338
00:20:03.256 --> 00:20:05.756
when you found out you couldn't go into the room?

339
00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:08.556
It... it just didn't dawn on me

340
00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:10.856
because I was in a rush!

341
00:20:10.856 --> 00:20:13.156
No. In order to hide the hole that you made

342
00:20:13.156 --> 00:20:15.356
to drop the key into the room,

343
00:20:15.356 --> 00:20:18.256
you needed to crack the skylight!

344
00:20:18.256 --> 00:20:19.456
Wrong!

345
00:20:19.456 --> 00:20:21.456
Then, let me ask you.

346
00:20:21.456 --> 00:20:24.456
When you broke the skylight and landed in the room,

347
00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:27.356
there were many keys on the floor.

348
00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:31.756
But you without hesitation picked up the key to the room.

349
00:20:31.756 --> 00:20:34.856
How did you know that it was the key to the room?

350
00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:38.456
The key holder!

351
00:20:38.456 --> 00:20:40.156
It's because I knew from before

352
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.356
that the key holder with the sapphires

353
00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:44.756
was the one with the key to the room!

354
00:20:44.756 --> 00:20:46.856
That's strange,

355
00:20:46.856 --> 00:20:48.356
because that key holder that the key was attached to

356
00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:51.456
was switched just before the murder was committed.

357
00:20:51.456 --> 00:20:54.856
When my daughter asked Reika to read her fortune,

358
00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:58.956
she gave my daughter her key holder as a lucky charm.

359
00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:00.456
Isn't that right, Ran?

360
00:21:00.456 --> 00:21:01.456
Yes.

361
00:21:05.756 --> 00:21:10.556
The room key was attached to the Sapphire key holder

362
00:21:10.556 --> 00:21:12.856
after Reika entered her workshop.

363
00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:17.656
How can you, who haven't seen or talked to Reika after that,

364
00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:19.856
have known about this?

365
00:21:21.956 --> 00:21:24.756
The only person who can tell that the key on the sapphire key holder

366
00:21:24.756 --> 00:21:26.056
is the one for room,

367
00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:27.656
other than Reika,

368
00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:31.656
is the murderer who used the key to carry out the locked room murder,

369
00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:32.956
Mr. Katsuragi!

370
00:21:38.956 --> 00:21:40.856
That woman's to blame.

371
00:21:40.856 --> 00:21:45.656
She suddenly demanded me to pay her back all the money that she invested.

372
00:21:45.656 --> 00:21:46.856
She told me that if I can't pay her back,

373
00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:50.656
she was going to sell my story of getting insider information from a printer

374
00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:53.556
and sell it to the magazines.

375
00:23:30.756 --> 00:23:32.356
Ran.

376
00:23:32.356 --> 00:23:34.156
What did you want her to read for you?

377
00:23:34.156 --> 00:23:35.356
What?

378
00:23:37.056 --> 00:23:40.156
Where Shinichi is right now?

379
00:23:41.556 --> 00:23:43.556
I'm right here.

380
00:23:43.556 --> 00:23:45.956
I wonder...

381
00:23:45.956 --> 00:23:47.756
if he's really doing okay.

382
00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.856
Rather than worry about Shinichi,

383
00:23:54.856 --> 00:23:57.656
I think first priority is how we're going to

384
00:23:57.656 --> 00:24:00.156
take Pops home, don't you think?

385
00:24:04.456 --> 00:24:07.256
I wonder if there's anyone who reads snores?

386
00:24:09.556 --> 00:24:12.456
"Next Episode" -24 hours with Kogoro Mouri?

387
00:24:13.456 --> 00:24:15.456
I will accept your offer!

388
00:24:20.056 --> 00:24:22.956
You came into this locked room before anyone else did

389
00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:27.156
and hid the evidence you didn't get to erase!

390
00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:30.656
Wrong. This is no ordinary murder.

391
00:24:31.656 --> 00:24:34.156
This is an impossible crime!

392
00:24:34.156 --> 00:24:35.656
Next Conan,

393
00:24:35.656 --> 00:24:39.556
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 1)".

394
00:24:55.356 --> 00:24:57.356
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:57.356 --> 00:24:59.656
"Wet jacket".

396
00:24:59.656 --> 00:25:01.156
The playboy, Officer Takagi!

397
00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:02.156
Wild racket?

398
00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:04.756
Next on Detective Conan is "Wild Cheating Racket".
