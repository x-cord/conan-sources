1
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.740
"Urai"

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.040
What's with this chocolate?

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.240
My! You should at least be aware of

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.240
the new chocolate products that your company sells.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.840
Yeah.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.440
The Spy Choco White that we'll be selling

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.540
from March for White Day.

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.840
Yes.

9
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.740
An even sourer chocolate

10
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.340
than the favoured Spy Choco Black.

11
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.640
It's very sour white chocolate.

12
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.840
"Taruto Urai (53), Urai Confections President" -Hey, hey. Don't tell me

13
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.840
that you want me to test taste the chocolate.

14
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.040
You know that I don't take to sour things, do you?

15
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.040
I've been telling you from before

16
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.340
that I'm in charge of the sweet stuff

17
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.240
and you, the vice-president's in charge of the sour stuff.

18
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.440
Don't take my word for it, but I promise it's good so taste one.

19
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.940
"Hoshie Urai (49), Taruto Urai's wife" -Maybe you'd be okay with it by now.

20
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940
No way.

21
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.040
I got sick over the citrus fruit cake

22
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.340
that you made for fun the other day too, didn't I?

23
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.840
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.440
I was just trying to remedy your hate for sour things.

25
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.540
By the way, did you think up something

26
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.140
for my speech tonight?

27
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.240
For March 14th?

28
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.440
The kind of idea

29
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.140
that will surprise the guests that we have invited to the party

30
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.840
out of their wits and liven it up?

31
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.440
I've got one such idea,

32
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.640
would you like to try it out?

33
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.040
I'm sure everyone will really be surprised.

34
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.340
Something that'll make their eyes pop out?

35
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.340
Yes, I think you yourself will be very surprised too.

36
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.140
So much that you'll die.

37
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.940
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

38
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.340
Tears are start of all dramas.

39
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.940
In exchange for sour chocolate

40
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.840
is the aroma of a crime on White Day.

41
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:20.386
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 1)".

45
00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:37.086
Darn! Out of the 24-hour time limit that I had,

46
00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:38.986
I've only got less than an hour!

47
00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:42.286
I've got to search up the spy within the amount of time left

48
00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:44.086
or everything will go down the drain!

49
00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:48.586
Just what do you think you're doing?

50
00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:49.886
The four blocks in this area

51
00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:52.186
are being closed off! Hurry!

52
00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:55.286
Hey, is that information you got verified?

53
00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:57.586
Yes! The spy is black!

54
00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:59.886
Don't make me repeat myself!

55
00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:01.086
If the spy's black...

56
00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:05.086
Then why are all the chocolates white?

57
00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:10.486
Sour!

58
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:14.986
This time it's an even sourer spy choco white!

59
00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:16.986
It's popular and in stores now!

60
00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.986
Don't forget the original spy choco black too.

61
00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:21.986
Your dad's pretty good, Ran.

62
00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:24.586
Moreover, he's acting together with his beloved Yoko

63
00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:26.386
on a TV AD too.

64
00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:28.586
He must be on cloud nine!

65
00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:29.886
Nope.

66
00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:32.586
He keeps complaining that his face is barely recognizable

67
00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.086
because of the hat and sunglasses he wore.

68
00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.486
But, thanks to that commercial,

69
00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:40.786
we were invited to the White Day party by its manufacturer, right?

70
00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:42.386
Was the party tonight?

71
00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:46.186
Yes. At Haido City Hotel starting from 18:00.

72
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:50.186
I hear that the company was established on March 14th.

73
00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:53.586
Talking about White Day,

74
00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:55.986
did you receive anything, Ran?

75
00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:58.486
A gift in return from Shinichi.

76
00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:05.286
You gave him hand-made Valentine's chocolate too, didn't you, Ran?

77
00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:07.286
Well, I did sort of give it to him.

78
00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:10.086
Or rather, he ate it without permission.

79
00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:15.086
I wonder if Kygyoku's going to give me something,

80
00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:16.886
in return on White Day.

81
00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:20.886
It seems that boys are not as concerned about it as girls, though.

82
00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:25.286
They may not even know about White Day.

83
00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:26.686
True.

84
00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:30.086
If you give somebody chocolate on Valentine's Day,

85
00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:32.886
you get a return gift on March 14th!

86
00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:35.086
That's good news.

87
00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:36.986
Officer Sato!

88
00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:40.186
Okay, then, Officer Takagi!

89
00:05:40.186 --> 00:05:44.186
I didn't get any chocolate from you, Officer Sato.

90
00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:47.186
I was really waiting for one and yet...

91
00:05:47.186 --> 00:05:49.086
I gave you, remember?

92
00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:52.286
On February 14th when we were on a stakeout.

93
00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.286
You want?

94
00:05:55.286 --> 00:05:57.186
You mean that?

95
00:05:57.186 --> 00:05:58.886
It was half-eaten!

96
00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:00.086
Officer Takagi.

97
00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:01.586
Chocolates like crimes,

98
00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:03.886
have no big or small or half eaten to them, you know.

99
00:06:03.886 --> 00:06:05.786
About that...

100
00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:09.986
Hey, everyone!

101
00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:12.286
Have you finished the investigation and asking questions?

102
00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:13.786
Mr. Shiratori!

103
00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:18.586
What's with that box?

104
00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:22.586
It's a White Day gift I'm giving to Ms. Kobayashi.

105
00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:27.086
Well, I was trying to make up my mind on whether to give her

106
00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:29.086
biscuits, candies, white chocolates or marshmallows

107
00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:31.486
that the box kept getting larger.

108
00:06:31.486 --> 00:06:33.386
I'll see you all then!

109
00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.086
Just as would be expected of Mr. Shiratori.

110
00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:39.286
He's got love.

111
00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:41.986
In the meantime, I wonder what Officer Takagi was doing.

112
00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:46.286
I'm sorry, I'm so thoughtless!

113
00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:48.486
"Mouri Detective Agency"

114
00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:51.886
What's the matter, Conan?

115
00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:54.086
I'm sorry, I forgot something.

116
00:06:54.086 --> 00:06:55.786
Go ahead on the cab without me!

117
00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.486
Come to think of it,

118
00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:03.186
are you over with your cold already?

119
00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:04.886
You were a bit nasal, right?

120
00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.286
Yep, I'm fine already!

121
00:07:07.286 --> 00:07:09.786
"Haido City Hotel"

122
00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:13.986
What? Yoko Okino can't come?

123
00:07:13.986 --> 00:07:15.386
Are you serious?

124
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.286
Yes, we got word just a while ago

125
00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:18.586
because the take for the drama

126
00:07:18.586 --> 00:07:20.986
is taking longer than expected, so she can't come.

127
00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:24.386
And I brought her a White Day gift too.

128
00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:25.786
What's that about?

129
00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:28.986
Mom nor I got one yet.

130
00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:31.486
Hello there, great detective.

131
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.686
Welcome to Urai Confections 8th Anniversary Party.

132
00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:40.286
Who may I ask are you?

133
00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:43.586
I'm President of Urai Confections, Taruto Urai.

134
00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:45.986
I think we've never met before.

135
00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:47.986
President?

136
00:07:47.986 --> 00:07:51.586
And this is my wife and vice-president.

137
00:07:51.586 --> 00:07:54.986
I'm Hoshie. It's an honor to see you,

138
00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:57.286
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.

139
00:07:57.286 --> 00:08:00.086
Well, hello.

140
00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:08.886
How gorgeous!

141
00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:10.386
Really.

142
00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:12.286
Look at all the people, Conan.

143
00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:13.286
Yeah.

144
00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:15.786
Come along!

145
00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.686
It's a buffet,

146
00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:21.386
so help yourself to the food and drinks as you like.

147
00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:22.786
Yes, ma'am!

148
00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:28.986
Come over here, Ran.

149
00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.486
It's all kinds of food all you can eat!

150
00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:32.086
You'd better make yourself a plate right away too!

151
00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.686
Fried prawns, fried prawns!

152
00:08:33.686 --> 00:08:35.386
Hey, Dad, hold it.

153
00:08:35.386 --> 00:08:37.686
Pops, control yourself.

154
00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.386
It's good!

155
00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:43.186
Just as expected of the Haido City Hotel,

156
00:08:43.186 --> 00:08:44.886
the food is top class too!

157
00:08:44.886 --> 00:08:47.686
I wonder what they have in store for us.

158
00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:48.786
What?

159
00:08:48.786 --> 00:08:50.686
It's President Urai!

160
00:08:50.686 --> 00:08:52.286
According to Sonoko,

161
00:08:52.286 --> 00:08:55.986
he does something interesting at every party.

162
00:08:55.986 --> 00:08:57.486
He does magic,

163
00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:00.086
or come out wearing the stuffed animal clothes that he wore on TV ads,

164
00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:04.086
or even do plays in the spotlight at times.

165
00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:08.086
So, I think everybody's anticipating what he'll do.

166
00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:11.586
A skit...

167
00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:17.386
I've got to say that the commercial was great, involving great acting.

168
00:09:17.386 --> 00:09:18.586
Yes.

169
00:09:18.586 --> 00:09:21.386
I'm glad and was right to have used you to make that commercial.

170
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.786
Well, well!

171
00:09:25.486 --> 00:09:28.586
The fact is, I asked Yoko to use you

172
00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:32.286
as her partner investigator.

173
00:09:32.286 --> 00:09:36.286
Well, she's into me, you see, so...

174
00:09:36.286 --> 00:09:37.886
Not true.

175
00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:38.886
Gosh.

176
00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:39.886
Now, I'd like to introduce

177
00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:42.186
one of the star actors of the present commercial.

178
00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:45.486
We'd like the great Detective Kogoro Mouri to say a few words!

179
00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:53.486
Well, hello there, everyone.

180
00:09:54.786 --> 00:09:56.886
-That's right, Ran. -Yes?

181
00:09:56.886 --> 00:09:58.686
Would you like me to read your palm?

182
00:09:58.686 --> 00:10:01.786
Palm reading?

183
00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:05.286
I didn't know that you could read palms.

184
00:10:05.286 --> 00:10:07.986
My, I read yours every time

185
00:10:07.986 --> 00:10:11.286
before I wake you up in the morning.

186
00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:14.386
Your lifeline is pretty short, so be careful

187
00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:16.186
that you don't pass on before your time comes.

188
00:10:16.186 --> 00:10:17.786
Hey, hey.

189
00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:20.686
Well, talking of Spy Chocolates,

190
00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:23.686
I would like to tell you a bit

191
00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:28.386
about the special jobs I goofed on so far as a detective.

192
00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:32.886
My, Ran, you're very lucky, aren't you?

193
00:10:32.886 --> 00:10:35.286
You have a straight line going from right bottom of your palm

194
00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.986
to the bottom of your little finger.

195
00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:40.086
I usually win at lotteries.

196
00:10:41.986 --> 00:10:44.186
So...

197
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:47.186
how... how's my love life?

198
00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:54.786
Well, your marriage line is sideways in the shape of a Y.

199
00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:56.686
This means that you have to overcome many obstacles

200
00:10:56.686 --> 00:10:58.886
in order to get together with the one you love.

201
00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:01.886
You're going to be cornered into a doomed state of love.

202
00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:04.386
Hey! Hey! Hey!

203
00:11:04.386 --> 00:11:06.786
Is it working?

204
00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:08.686
Yes, I'm listening!

205
00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:10.886
No, you.

206
00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:13.486
Yeah, I think so.

207
00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:18.586
But, finally after a dramatic turn of the tables,

208
00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:20.586
you two may become a couple,

209
00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:23.686
so try not to get into too many fights with your boyfriend.

210
00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:24.686
Okay.

211
00:11:37.286 --> 00:11:40.786
Hey, what is it, Dear?

212
00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:43.486
Is this supposed to be your mystery skit?

213
00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:51.086
Detective Mouri, come here, please!

214
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.986
I guess it's showtime for you.

215
00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:56.286
Yes?

216
00:11:56.286 --> 00:12:00.286
Why didn't they tell me beforehand?

217
00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:04.286
Come on, he really looks like he's dead.

218
00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:12.486
So, the estimated time of death is 19:54.

219
00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:13.886
From my long experience as a detective

220
00:12:13.886 --> 00:12:15.786
and if my premonition is correct,

221
00:12:15.786 --> 00:12:20.486
the culprit is here without a doubt!

222
00:12:22.686 --> 00:12:26.086
And what after this?

223
00:12:26.086 --> 00:12:27.986
President Urai?

224
00:12:27.986 --> 00:12:30.586
Hello! Hey!

225
00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:34.086
He can't answer no matter how much you call him.

226
00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:36.386
Because he's not breathing.

227
00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:39.986
He... he's dead? For real?

228
00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:43.286
Hey. You're joking, aren't you?

229
00:12:43.286 --> 00:12:46.186
Dear? Dear?

230
00:12:46.186 --> 00:12:48.386
Dear!

231
00:12:48.386 --> 00:12:51.286
His mouth smelled like almond.

232
00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:53.486
Cyanide compound poisoning.

233
00:12:54.786 --> 00:12:56.586
He's been poisoned.

234
00:13:02.633 --> 00:13:05.933
The victim is Mr. Taruto Urai, age 53,

235
00:13:05.933 --> 00:13:07.733
the president of Urai Confections,

236
00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:11.033
and the host of this party.

237
00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:13.733
I heard from the coroner that he was poisoned.

238
00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:16.033
Yes, sir. He died from acute drug poisoning

239
00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:18.433
by a cyanide compound.

240
00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:21.833
So, when the president collapsed,

241
00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:25.533
Conan, Ran and you, his wife,

242
00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:27.833
who is the vice president of Urai Confections,

243
00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:31.233
were the only three near him?

244
00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:33.833
Yes, that's right.

245
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:36.133
I think it was just when Mr. Mouri went up to the podium

246
00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:38.533
to deliver his speech.

247
00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:39.733
Yes.

248
00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:43.533
My husband suddenly let out a loud groan and fell to the floor.

249
00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:45.733
He hasn't moved since.

250
00:13:45.733 --> 00:13:46.733
If I remember correctly,

251
00:13:46.733 --> 00:13:51.333
the one who was right beside the president at that time was you.

252
00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:55.233
Yes. I was palm reading for Ran.

253
00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:56.333
Palm reading?

254
00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:58.233
Is it true?

255
00:13:58.233 --> 00:13:59.433
Yes.

256
00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:02.333
Mrs. Urai held my left hand with both her hands

257
00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.833
and read my palms.

258
00:14:05.133 --> 00:14:07.533
If both her hands were being used,

259
00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:11.733
she couldn't have made him drink the poison with her hands.

260
00:14:11.733 --> 00:14:16.533
Did Mrs. Urai call out to her husband back then?

261
00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:19.333
Saying something like drink something or eat something.

262
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.233
No, not especially.

263
00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:24.433
But while she was reading your palm,

264
00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:26.533
Mrs. Urai said at one point,

265
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:30.033
"Is it working?".

266
00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:32.333
Working?

267
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:35.633
At first I thought she was talking to me,

268
00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:38.533
but I later found out that she was talking to her husband.

269
00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:40.933
It's because he looked dazed out

270
00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:43.833
when Mr. Mouri was giving his speech.

271
00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:46.833
But, the president's answer back then

272
00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:49.333
was sort of strange.

273
00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:50.633
Strange?

274
00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:54.033
He didn't answer "It's working" or "It's not working"

275
00:14:54.033 --> 00:14:57.733
but rather, "Yeah, I think so" was his answer.

276
00:14:57.733 --> 00:14:58.933
I see.

277
00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:00.433
It's true that the answer is a strange one,

278
00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:04.033
if the question was whether listening to my speech was working or not.

279
00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.333
He was probably dazed out and not really listening,

280
00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:09.633
so he answered ambiguously.

281
00:15:09.633 --> 00:15:12.033
My husband was scheduled to make

282
00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:15.033
a serious announcement after Mr. Mouri's speech.

283
00:15:15.033 --> 00:15:16.833
A serious speech?

284
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.233
Yes.

285
00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:21.533
About divorcing me and splitting the company into two.

286
00:15:22.933 --> 00:15:24.933
Is that true?

287
00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:26.133
Yes.

288
00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:29.133
Urai Confections have become large enough,

289
00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:30.633
and my husband and I have been having a lot of arguments

290
00:15:30.633 --> 00:15:33.733
because of differences in management policies.

291
00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:36.433
Actually, my husband had pleaded and cried

292
00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:38.933
asking me to think it over, though.

293
00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:40.933
"I don't mind splitting the company up

294
00:15:40.933 --> 00:15:42.933
but please don't divorce me.

295
00:15:42.933 --> 00:15:45.733
I can't live without you", he said.

296
00:15:45.733 --> 00:15:48.133
Which means, don't tell me...

297
00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:50.433
He committed suicide from grief

298
00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.433
could be another viewpoint.

299
00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:55.633
If so, it's a great disappointment.

300
00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:56.933
I'm a professional when it comes to sour tastes

301
00:15:56.933 --> 00:15:58.633
while my husband is an expert on sweet-tasting things.

302
00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:02.233
Just when I thought he had convinced himself

303
00:16:02.233 --> 00:16:05.133
that we go our own way at what we excel in...

304
00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:08.133
Come to think of it, my friend once told me

305
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.633
that the president as well as his wife

306
00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:12.233
have won the confectionery contest.

307
00:16:12.233 --> 00:16:15.633
No, my husband has.

308
00:16:15.633 --> 00:16:17.633
I came in second place.

309
00:16:17.633 --> 00:16:20.733
I've never won the contest.

310
00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:22.433
But...

311
00:16:22.433 --> 00:16:23.533
Never mind that,

312
00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:25.233
but if you're going to body search me,

313
00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:27.433
will you do so quickly?

314
00:16:28.933 --> 00:16:31.733
If anyone were to give my husband poison,

315
00:16:31.733 --> 00:16:35.233
there could be no likely one than me who was right beside him.

316
00:16:35.233 --> 00:16:37.733
If so, I may still have the poison

317
00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:40.533
that would serve as evidence on me, right?

318
00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.433
Yes, well...

319
00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:46.633
I would appreciate it if you would body check me

320
00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:49.533
in the staff room beyond that door over there.

321
00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:52.433
Because I'm sure that at the entrance of this hall there

322
00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:53.633
are a lot of people from the press

323
00:16:53.633 --> 00:16:56.233
who have heard about this incident gathered around.

324
00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:59.733
If they see an officer taking me out from there,

325
00:16:59.733 --> 00:17:03.433
they may think that I'm being escorted to the station or something.

326
00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:05.533
I see.

327
00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:07.533
Officer Sato, take care of her for me.

328
00:17:07.533 --> 00:17:08.833
Yes, sir!

329
00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:10.133
Shall we?

330
00:17:10.133 --> 00:17:12.733
Excuse me, please let us through.

331
00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:20.533
Are you all right?

332
00:17:22.533 --> 00:17:25.633
I shouldn't have worn such high heels like this.

333
00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:28.133
Shall I lend you my shoulder?

334
00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:29.733
I'm fine.

335
00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:32.433
I just sprained my ankle.

336
00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:34.433
Let's get it over with, okay?

337
00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:42.833
Inspector Megure.

338
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:45.833
I'll take it back with me and check it in detail,

339
00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:49.033
but there seem to be no traces of poison

340
00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:51.433
in the food or drinks here on the table.

341
00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:52.933
I see.

342
00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:55.933
Well, I don't think he drank from the lemon tea

343
00:17:55.933 --> 00:17:58.533
that his wife was drinking.

344
00:17:58.533 --> 00:17:59.533
Yeah.

345
00:17:59.533 --> 00:18:02.433
The president was known to hate sour things.

346
00:18:02.433 --> 00:18:04.433
I see.

347
00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:10.333
Are you hungry?

348
00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:14.933
Yeah, I haven't eaten anything after breakfast

349
00:18:14.933 --> 00:18:17.133
and I was summoned here

350
00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:19.033
just when I was about to have dinner, you see.

351
00:18:19.033 --> 00:18:23.833
But, doesn't your wife always make lunch for you, Inspector?

352
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:26.233
Well, just before leaving the house,

353
00:18:26.233 --> 00:18:28.533
I had a fight with Midori, you see.

354
00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:30.433
Like I just said,

355
00:18:30.433 --> 00:18:33.033
don't you have anything you need to give me today?

356
00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:35.333
So, I'm asking you, what is it?

357
00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:38.133
Well, it's so stupid,

358
00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:40.033
so don't ask me what it was.

359
00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:48.633
That's the gift that we passed out for this White Day party.

360
00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:51.633
Would you like me to give you one?

361
00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:53.033
No, thanks.

362
00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:55.633
White Day? What's that?

363
00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:58.333
It's judgment day when the extent

364
00:18:58.333 --> 00:18:59.833
of the love your boyfriend has for you

365
00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:01.833
will be exposed in broad daylight.

366
00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:04.933
First, you casually give him a Valentine's Day gift

367
00:19:04.933 --> 00:19:07.133
and exactly a month afterwards on March 14th

368
00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:08.433
if he gives you a gift in return,

369
00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:12.233
the bells of days of romance after romance will resound.

370
00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:13.833
But, if you get nothing, then the footsteps of broken love

371
00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:15.933
will close in.

372
00:19:15.933 --> 00:19:17.733
Footsteps of broken love?

373
00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:21.033
I'm sorry, I'm so thoughtless!

374
00:19:23.033 --> 00:19:27.033
Are you done with that heel?

375
00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:30.433
Yes. I'll check the other one then.

376
00:19:30.433 --> 00:19:33.533
No, no. I've got to concentrate on my job!

377
00:19:34.533 --> 00:19:35.933
What?

378
00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.733
A run-up murder?

379
00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:41.133
Yes, exactly, Inspector!

380
00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:42.133
From what I hear,

381
00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:44.333
the president's been putting on performances

382
00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:47.433
to surprise the guests every year at the party.

383
00:19:49.933 --> 00:19:53.833
Things like magic, masquerades or skits.

384
00:19:53.833 --> 00:19:54.833
In other words,

385
00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:57.333
the first time the president shouted and collapsed,

386
00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.333
it was a skit.

387
00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:02.633
It could be that he was counting on me

388
00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:05.433
to play the part as detective in his mystery story.

389
00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:09.433
But, of course he had no idea that he would be killed right after that.

390
00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:11.233
Then, who's the first person

391
00:20:11.233 --> 00:20:13.533
that ran up to him right after he collapsed?

392
00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:15.533
Mrs. Urai.

393
00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:19.133
She bent down close to the president and said,

394
00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:23.933
"Hey, what is it, dear? Is this supposed to be your mystery skit?"

395
00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:26.033
Don't tell me that she gave him the poison then!

396
00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.833
You mean she put it directly into his mouth?

397
00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:32.733
Yes. In other words, only his wife

398
00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:34.933
who knew of the contents of the skit could've done it.

399
00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.233
My, my.

400
00:20:36.233 --> 00:20:39.833
To think that a great detective like you would utter such nonsense...

401
00:20:41.033 --> 00:20:45.333
You were up on the podium and probably couldn't see,

402
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.833
but my husband after collapsing

403
00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:51.433
didn't even twitch nor utter a word.

404
00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:55.333
If I did administer the poison to him then,

405
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:59.833
wouldn't he has struggled and groaned in pain?

406
00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:02.233
Hey, Ran! How was it?

407
00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:04.633
You were nearby then, weren't you?

408
00:21:04.633 --> 00:21:06.333
Just as she says,

409
00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.833
he didn't move at all

410
00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.133
and looked to really be dead.

411
00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.333
In other words, your deduction right now

412
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:14.333
is the goofed up version that you always talk about

413
00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:19.133
before really getting down to the nitty-gritty real stuff.

414
00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:21.533
Goofed up version?

415
00:21:21.533 --> 00:21:24.233
I remember this part well, but...

416
00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:33.033
Hey, where did you blow the ash to?

417
00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:35.533
And how did the body check go?

418
00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:37.333
Yes, sir. No trace of poison

419
00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:40.733
nor of her having had possessed poison was detected.

420
00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:42.533
Most naturally.

421
00:21:42.533 --> 00:21:45.133
If so, this is...

422
00:21:45.133 --> 00:21:46.833
Inspector!

423
00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:49.133
A bottle of poison and a case of wafers

424
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:53.033
were found in the glove compartment of the president's car.

425
00:21:53.033 --> 00:21:56.433
By wafers, you mean the thing that you wrap powdered medicine in

426
00:21:56.433 --> 00:21:57.933
that melts immediately in your mouth?

427
00:21:57.933 --> 00:22:00.733
Yes, sir. I reported that to the coroner

428
00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:02.733
and he told me that he found a melted wafer

429
00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:05.233
on the molar of the president's mouth.

430
00:22:05.233 --> 00:22:09.433
I see. He hid the wafer with poison in his pocket,

431
00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:11.633
and drank it when he thought it was appropriate.

432
00:22:11.633 --> 00:22:14.133
So, can we conclude that it's suicide?

433
00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:21.333
I'm sure that Mrs. Urai is the culprit.

434
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.733
However, how on earth did she do it?

435
00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.533
"Next episode" -What was the menu for tonight, then?

436
00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:53.433
You must've bought the ingredients already, right?

437
00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:54.733
You couldn't have known beforehand

438
00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:57.733
that something like this was going to happen, right?

439
00:23:57.733 --> 00:23:59.833
Oh no! Dad's cigarette!

440
00:23:59.833 --> 00:24:02.533
Oh no, it's burnt.

441
00:24:02.533 --> 00:24:05.833
That's why Mrs. Urai deliberately went pass there.

442
00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:10.133
There's a very miracle trick!

443
00:24:10.133 --> 00:24:11.333
Next Conan,

444
00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:14.533
"White Day of Betrayal (Part 2)".

445
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.960
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.660
"Lemon".

447
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.660
Inspector, it'll become sour if you squeeze the lemon!

448
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.660
You idiot!

449
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.339
You go on and squeeze some brains out of your head!
