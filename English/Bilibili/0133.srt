1
00:00:00,682 --> 00:00:03,482
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:05,682
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:07,582
An unthinkable impossible crime has been committed.

4
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:09,482
There's got to be a clue somewhere.

5
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:10,982
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:13,182
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,882
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:58,195
Pops and I went to drop Sonoko and Ran off

9
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:00,695
at a snowy mountain lodge

10
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:03,595
in order for them to participate in an off the net gathering.

11
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:06,295
On the way back home, we hear the news over the car radio

12
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:08,395
that Mr. Tsutomu Nishiyama, the board leader of the Magic Lovers' Group

13
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,695
was murdered in his apartment.

14
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,295
Moreover, words hinting that there will be serial killings

15
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:15,095
were left at the scene.

16
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:21,195
In front of our very eyes, as we rushed back to Ran and the others,

17
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:24,395
the suspended bridge was up in flames as if to block our path.

18
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:31,295
I somehow make it back to the lodge alone,

19
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:34,595
but because of fever from my cold, I get very sick.

20
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:39,195
And, unfortunately,

21
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,495
another victim turned up.

22
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:45,795
It can't be.

23
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:48,295
What's wrong, Mr. Hamano?

24
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:52,795
Don't come.

25
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:58,495
It's no use. He's already dead.

26
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,495
Oh, no.

27
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,595
Besides, we don't want to mess the scene up anymore than it already is.

28
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:03,995
The scene?

29
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,095
Can't you tell?

30
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:09,395
The corpse is more than 10m away from the lodge,

31
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:13,395
and the only footprints left are those of the man who just ran up to him.

32
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,395
But then...

33
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,995
Right. This is a crime that couldn't have been committed

34
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:21,695
unless the murderer had wings.

35
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,895
This is an impossible crime!

36
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:33,795
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 2)"

37
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,395
Impossible crime?

38
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,495
But, why Mr. Hamano?

39
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:43,395
Why was he killed?

40
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:45,695
I don't know the reason yet.

41
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:49,295
All I can say for now is he died of strangulation.

42
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:53,295
Somebody choked Mr. Hamano with a thin string or something

43
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:54,795
and killed him,

44
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:58,695
then, somehow brought him here.

45
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:04,395
It has to be somebody who is near the vicinity of this lodge.

46
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,695
What?

47
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:06,795
Hey...

48
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:11,395
Are you saying that the killer is among us?

49
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:13,795
No, not really.

50
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,395
But, we're the only ones here, aren't we?

51
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,495
No.

52
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,795
There is another suspect.

53
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:21,095
What?

54
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:27,395
I feel that it is very likely that he is hiding somewhere.

55
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:29,495
Who are you referring to?

56
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:33,395
How strange... you are already forgotten?

57
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:36,595
One of the members of the Magic Lovers' Group

58
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:40,395
who was supposed to have come here to spend the night,

59
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,695
"Shadow".

60
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:49,195
I see. That's possible.

61
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:52,395
Besides, a message suggesting the possibility seems to have been left

62
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:55,595
on the computer near Mr. Nishiyama's corpse too.

63
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,795
Are you saying that he may be somewhere now,

64
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,695
waiting for a chance to kill us?

65
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,095
You've gotta be kidding!

66
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,795
Wait, Ms. Tanaka.

67
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:07,295
Ms. Tanaka. What's the matter?

68
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:08,695
I am going home.

69
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:10,895
I'm leaving this lodge where a killer may be hiding,

70
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,495
right this minute!

71
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:13,895
You can't go home.

72
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:17,295
-What? -When I came back here,

73
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,995
the suspended bridge was already set on fire by someone.

74
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:22,995
What? We can't get down to the foot of the mountain

75
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:24,595
without that suspended bridge.

76
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,295
Don't tell me that the killer severed the phone line too.

77
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:29,395
We can still use the cellular phone.

78
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,695
Oh.

79
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,395
No good.

80
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:35,595
This place is out of range and the cellular won't connect.

81
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,995
In other words, the killer has completely cut us off

82
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,695
from the world below.

83
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:43,295
Oh, no.

84
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:49,395
You figured out the identity of "Shadow"?

85
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,095
Are you serious, Inspector?

86
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:54,395
Yeah, I can't say who he is at the moment

87
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,495
but we found that he is a member of the Magic Lovers' Group.

88
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:01,195
Then, you can find out who he is by his I.D.

89
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,295
We checked,

90
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,895
but the person was completely unrelated with this case.

91
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,195
Completely unrelated?

92
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,195
Yeah.

93
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:09,295
He had nothing to do with magic.

94
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:13,995
Besides, he hasn't touched his computer for the last two years.

95
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:18,095
In other words, somebody has been using his password and I.D. number

96
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:22,595
and going the internet as "Shadow".

97
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:26,195
But, that's not the only problem.

98
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,295
Huh?

99
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:34,495
There is another suspicious person among those in that lodge

100
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:39,495
who is using the internet with a mysterious I.D. number.

101
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:50,795
I wonder if it's my fault.

102
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,395
Because I'm the one who picked Mr. Hamano

103
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,695
as the one in charge of entertainment tonight.

104
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,495
If Mr. Hamano didn't go up to his room alone,

105
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:02,995
he probably wouldn't have been killed.

106
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:06,895
Just because I chose him, Mr. Hamano...

107
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,695
Sonoko.

108
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,095
Don't worry yourself over it.

109
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,295
You were blindfolded

110
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:17,095
and marked the sheets at random back then, that's all you did.

111
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:20,095
You don't hold a grudge against the person who shoots the arrow

112
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:22,895
to pick the winning lottery, do you?

113
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:24,995
It's the same as that.

114
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:29,095
All you did was help Mr. Hamano with his magic.

115
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:32,795
You have no reason to worry yourself over it, do you?

116
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,595
No.

117
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:37,595
Help him out with his magic?

118
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:40,295
Are we going to be all right,

119
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:43,395
just waiting here like this till help arrives?

120
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,595
We'll be fine.

121
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,195
When the bridge burned down,

122
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:49,495
Pops said from the other end of the bridge,

123
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:51,295
"I will get the police right away,"

124
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,495
"so stay put and wait at the lodge."

125
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:57,295
I am sure that he'll come with the police to rescue us

126
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:59,195
as soon as day breaks.

127
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,395
I hope so.

128
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:05,495
But, if the killer is "Shadow"...

129
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,995
Maybe he's doing this because of the "chat" we had

130
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,195
the other day after all?

131
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:11,295
What's a... "chat"?

132
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:17,595
A "chat" is when many people communicate real time on the computer

133
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:19,195
using the phone line.

134
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,195
We communicate by typing out what we want to say,

135
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,095
and that in turn is displayed the screen.

136
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,495
But, why would that have anything to do with murder?

137
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:29,295
Remember, I told you that

138
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:32,695
they got into an argument over some magician.

139
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,095
I wonder if you know,

140
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:37,195
an elderly magician by the name of Fuden Harui,

141
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:41,295
who used to be called "Japan's Escape King".

142
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:44,095
Oh, is he the one who passed away last month

143
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,195
when he was performing because of an accident?

144
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:50,095
Yes. When we were talking about that accident,

145
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:54,795
"Shadow" suddenly made a weird remark and said,

146
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:59,695
"That great magician died because of you guys."

147
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,995
What did he mean?

148
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,695
6 months ago, we got carried away talking about

149
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:07,595
the "Escape Show" that was popular some years ago.

150
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:10,995
Just when we were hoping that someone would do it again,

151
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,395
he got into an accident.

152
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:17,995
"Shadow" insists it happened because we talked about it.

153
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:20,895
That's nothing but unjustified resentment.

154
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,895
I was concerned,

155
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,995
so I reconfirmed with Mr. Nishiyama, the board leader.

156
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,495
But we concluded that there was no one

157
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:30,495
who could've been Mr. Harui talking with us in chat 6 months ago.

158
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,195
But, we can never be sure whether the one

159
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:34,295
using the I.D. is actually who he's supposed to be.

160
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:38,995
Or somebody could've shown him the record of the chat.

161
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:43,695
That's why I planned this off the net gathering with Mr. Nishiyama.

162
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:45,995
We thought it'd be faster to have all the people

163
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,395
who participated in the chat 6 months ago to come here

164
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:52,795
-so we could see for ourselves. -Oh, I see.

165
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:57,195
But, wasn't it only recently that "Shadow" became a member?

166
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,895
How does he know of what went on 6 months ago?

167
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:02,995
Yeah, we invited "Shadow" to come

168
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:04,395
because we wanted to ask him directly

169
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,495
and get rid of any misunderstanding.

170
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:10,295
"Shadow" always used to say...

171
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:14,895
"I can fly through the air and make myself disappear."

172
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,495
Hey, that's...

173
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,095
Yes.

174
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,895
If the killer is "Shadow",

175
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:22,495
he would've carried out his performance

176
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:25,595
by committing the impossible crime.

177
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,495
He's putting on a performance of a bloody magic show

178
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:29,895
right before our eyes.

179
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:34,795
It's getting cold.

180
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:38,895
I think I'll go get something to slip on.

181
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:41,495
Oh, I'll go too, then.

182
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:44,895
I want to go get a sweater or something for him to wear.

183
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,295
I'll go too, then.

184
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:49,395
The more, the safer.

185
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:02,395
What a bummer, needing to get jittery even to enter a room.

186
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,795
I don't want to wear something so baggy.

187
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,095
Hey, don't move.

188
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:11,695
What was that about Sonoko helping out with the magic?

189
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,195
Something about Mr. Hamano

190
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:17,095
deciding by magic what everyone should do.

191
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,395
By magic?

192
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:22,395
Yes, and the temporary leader turned out to be Ms. Kuroda.

193
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:25,295
Ms. Tanaka had to make the bath.

194
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:28,395
The one in charge of entertainment turned out to be Mr. Hamano.

195
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,695
Which means that

196
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,095
Mr. Hamano went up to his room alone

197
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:33,895
because he was picked to the one in charge of entertainment?

198
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:37,795
Yep. It seems he was thinking up some magic in his room.

199
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:40,595
What were the others doing then?

200
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:44,195
I wonder. Everybody had something to do.

201
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,895
Hurry, Ran.

202
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:48,395
Because God knows where "Shadow" may be stalking us.

203
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:49,795
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,895
"Shadow", I wonder if he's really the killer.

205
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,795
Nobody has seen him yet.

206
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:03,895
Besides, everybody's alibi is not all that clear either.

207
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,095
At any rate, the killer

208
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:09,195
is planning to confine us here, and still do something.

209
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,895
But, I won't let him have his way.

210
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:15,395
If he is planning another murder, then more so...

211
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,095
What was that?

212
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,095
An arrow suddenly came flying.

213
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:24,895
No.

214
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,495
Who is it? Come out here!

215
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:29,795
-Don't! -Get away from the window!

216
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,195
What was that?

217
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:35,295
Sonoko?

218
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,495
Darn!

219
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,195
Sonoko? Where's Sonoko?

220
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,095
She went to the ladies room with Ms. Kuroda.

221
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,295
What's wrong?

222
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:48,595
The window. We heard the window cracking in the bathroom,

223
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,695
so Sonoko looked in.

224
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:58,195
There is an arrow poked through the mirror.

225
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,295
It came from that window, eh?

226
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:04,395
Somebody from outside is trying to take our lives.

227
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,895
You've gotta be kidding. I've had enough.

228
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:08,695
Oh, please wait, Ms. Tanaka!

229
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,295
Ms. Tanaka!

230
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:15,095
Don't go outside!

231
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,695
I don't know who the heck you are.

232
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,195
But, why don't you stop hiding like a coward and come on out?

233
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:25,095
Hey, look. There are footprints all over the woods.

234
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,695
So, someone's hiding after all.

235
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:29,695
Oh, no.

236
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,395
Be careful.

237
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,895
Ms. Tanaka.

238
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,695
Are you all right?

239
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,895
Why do we have to go through something like this?

240
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,395
Why?

241
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:49,895
Hey. Isn't that a bow gun?

242
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,895
Now we know for sure.

243
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:58,395
That the killer is someone other than all of us here.

244
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:00,395
It's lucky that

245
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:05,095
the killer let go of his bow gun before anyone else got hurt.

246
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,995
Darn.

247
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:21,784
This off the net gathering is the pits.

248
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:24,084
I shouldn't have come here.

249
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:27,384
Oh, I don't think the gathering is to blame.

250
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,484
I guess you guys don't mind,

251
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:32,984
but I was directly almost killed by that bow gun.

252
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,984
Do you know how I feel?

253
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:36,984
Well, let's go back to the lodge, shall we?

254
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,184
It's dangerous out here.

255
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,484
I guess so.

256
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:44,784
Poor Mr. Hamano.

257
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,484
He's going to be left all alone out in the snow.

258
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:50,584
Maybe we should put sheets or something over him.

259
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,984
No.

260
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:58,384
No footprints around the corpse on the snow

261
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:01,784
is clear proof that this was an impossible crime to commit.

262
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:05,784
We shouldn't mar that beautiful piece of art

263
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:08,284
with needless footprints.

264
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:12,184
-Piece of art, what's with you? -Cold...

265
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:19,084
Hey, isn't this the arrow of the bow gun?

266
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,584
Then, was that meant for me?

267
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:26,584
If we were unlucky, we could've been shot by it too.

268
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,984
Let's all go back to the lodge, everyone.

269
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,784
The snow that has piled up on the branches

270
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:41,484
have fallen to the ground only around this big tree.

271
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:44,084
Why?

272
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,284
It's a hole.

273
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:58,084
There is a brand new hole in the trunk of the tree.

274
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:00,784
I wonder if somebody opened it now just for fun.

275
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,184
Or...

276
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:05,284
did somebody who is loitering around here open it?

277
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:07,284
If so, why...

278
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,584
The guy who's been acting pretty strange

279
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,884
since a while ago smells fishy.

280
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:17,184
Katsuki Doito.

281
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,884
What was I doing when Mr. Hamano was killed?

282
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:24,784
I was asleep then so I want to know.

283
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,584
What good is it going to do you?

284
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:28,884
I get it.

285
00:16:28,884 --> 00:16:32,084
You think that the killer is among us, don't you?

286
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:35,984
But, sonny, the arrow came flying in from outside

287
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,784
and, the bow gun was found in the woods.

288
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:41,584
No matter how you look at, somebody other than us,

289
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,584
an outsider is trying to kill us...

290
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,484
But, nobody saw the killer, right?

291
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,284
I think it's too soon to jump to conclusions yet.

292
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,584
-Conan. -Yes,

293
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:52,984
we may as well get things straight while we're at it.

294
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:55,584
Mr. Hamano was killed

295
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:58,584
while he was in the room all alone, right?

296
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,184
At that time,

297
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,284
I was setting the table together with Ms. Kuroda

298
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,484
and getting ready for entertainment time.

299
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:06,384
Right, Ms. Kuroda?

300
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:08,584
Yes. After we set the table,

301
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:12,584
I went to the kitchen and helped Mr. Sugama.

302
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:16,084
I was making the snacks Mr. Ara asked me prepare.

303
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,884
When Ms. Kuroda and Mr. Sugama were in the kitchen,

304
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:20,784
what were you doing, Mr. Doito?

305
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:23,384
Yeah, I went to the room to get some firecrackers

306
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:24,884
for entertainment time.

307
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:27,784
Oh... fire crackers.

308
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:30,584
I went to the room Ran was in

309
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,784
to check on how Conan was doing, right?

310
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,684
Yes, and since Sonoko asked me

311
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,284
to come down for entertainment time,

312
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:40,884
we left Conan in the room and came down to the living room.

313
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:44,184
I went to the wine cellar to pick up some wine.

314
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:46,884
I went to burn firewood for the bath

315
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:49,084
because I was picked as Bath person.

316
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:51,684
Do you know how long that took?

317
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:56,184
Well, maybe it took about 7 to 8 minutes.

318
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,384
I think that's about right.

319
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:00,484
But, I can't recall the exact time it took.

320
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,884
-Approximately 8 minutes. -Huh?

321
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:08,184
I was using the oven till Mr. Ara got back.

322
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:12,484
But, would it really take 8 minutes to go get wine?

323
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:16,484
I had completely forgotten that I changed locks of the wine cellar,

324
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,584
and went back to my room to get the key.

325
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:20,284
A new key?

326
00:18:20,284 --> 00:18:23,184
Would you like to see it for yourself?

327
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:30,384
See, the top are the newly installed keys.

328
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,184
Really, it has a lot of keys on it.

329
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:35,884
Why are they so many locks on the door?

330
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,484
Just the other day a thief broke into the cellar.

331
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,484
That's why I got more keys.

332
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,384
The only valuables I have around here

333
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:45,084
is this wine cellar, so...

334
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:48,484
Is that the door to the kitchen?

335
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:49,884
Yeah.

336
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,784
There are many footprints around it.

337
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:57,684
When I got here, we all went once around the lodge.

338
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:00,284
So, maybe that's how they got there?

339
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:02,384
All right, sonny, that's enough, isn't it?

340
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:04,884
-Let's hurry on inside. -While we're at it,

341
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,284
could I see the place where you burn firewood for the bath?

342
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,084
Hey, hey.

343
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,284
This is the place where firewood is burned to make the bath.

344
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,984
There doesn't seem to be much snow on the eaves.

345
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:19,684
Yeah, it gets warm when you burn firewood for the bath

346
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:22,184
so the snow slides off.

347
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:26,084
What window is that?

348
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:29,784
It's the window on the 2nd floor at the end of the corridor.

349
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,484
Then if you climb up the stairs,

350
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,884
you get to go upstairs, right, Ms. Tanaka?

351
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:36,284
Conan.

352
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:37,384
I guess so.

353
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,384
But, I'm not the only one who could've climbed up there.

354
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:43,584
I went to look in on the temperature of the bath water

355
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,084
2 or 3 times.

356
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,484
Hey. Just what do you mean by that?

357
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:51,284
I'm just saying that if anyone came here when I wasn't around,

358
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:53,084
anybody could've climbed up.

359
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:56,584
-I didn't. -The arrow of the bow gun

360
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,384
was shot through the window of that bathroom

361
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:01,184
and Ms. Tanaka's room right above it.

362
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:03,284
If the killer shot the arrow,

363
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:04,384
he would've done so from the woods

364
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,884
that we all were at a while ago but...

365
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:09,284
Something's not right.

366
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:11,284
The killer shooting the arrow into Ms. Tanaka' room

367
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,384
because a silhouetted figure can be seen through the window,

368
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:17,384
but why would he shoot through the bathroom window?

369
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:24,484
Hey, this is a staple.

370
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,884
Why would something like this be in a place like this?

371
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:30,184
Don't tell me that...

372
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,084
It could be that...

373
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:46,284
How's your investigation coming along, little detective?

374
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:49,184
Oh, well, so-so.

375
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,784
Hey, everybody's gone inside already.

376
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,684
You're always skittering here and there,

377
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:57,584
so we can't take our eyes off you.

378
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,684
Go.

379
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:01,184
Sonoko.

380
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:03,984
Please tell me the details of when Mr. Hamano decided

381
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,784
what chores everyone should do.

382
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:06,884
Huh?

383
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,784
I see.

384
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:15,984
I'm starting to get the picture of this case.

385
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,184
There is only one thing left to figure out.

386
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:21,284
The impossible crime.

387
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:25,784
I won't be able to corner the killer unless I solve that mystery.

388
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,984
How was it done anyway?

389
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:32,184
There are no footprints anywhere in the snow,

390
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:35,084
10m away from the corpse.

391
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,284
Doing something like that is impossible

392
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:40,584
unless the corpse is dropped from a crane or something.

393
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:44,884
There would at least have to be a pillar near the corpse.

394
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:48,084
Otherwise, there's no way it can be done.

395
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:50,884
How about some wine? It'll warm you up.

396
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:53,084
Drinking at this time of night?

397
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:55,184
It wouldn't hurt to drink a bit, would it?

398
00:21:55,184 --> 00:21:57,484
It'll help us refresh a bit.

399
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:12,084
I see. So, that's what it is.

400
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:15,984
That's why the killer burned the suspended bridge down

401
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:18,784
and cut us off from the world below.

402
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:24,084
I've figured it out completely.

403
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,484
The trick used to carry out the impossible crime.

404
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:31,484
As well as the one who carried it out.

405
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:05,784
Sonny?

406
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:10,184
That was Conan's voice.

407
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,184
Okay, let's all go look for him.

408
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:20,184
Not again?

409
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:21,884
There is somebody there.

410
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:24,684
-Huh? -This time, in the woods on the right side.

411
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:27,884
Oh, wait.

412
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,384
Next Conan,

413
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,284
"The Magic Lovers' Murder Case (Part 3)"

414
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:36,686
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:38,186
"Bow gun"

416
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:40,686
The case will be solved in the next episode.

417
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,786
The person will finally appear.
