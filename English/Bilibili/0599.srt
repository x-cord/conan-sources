1
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.840
Hey, old man!

2
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.140
-Hurry up, will you! -That's interesting, right?

3
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.240
Come on and get going!

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.440
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440
What a rough guy.

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.040
Purse snatcher! Somebody!

7
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.540
Catch him!

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.840
He's the guy we saw a while ago.

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.140
You mean he was a purse snatcher?

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.540
Stop!

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.640
Move it!

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.840
Watch out, boy!

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.940
Oh, no!

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.740
It hurts!

15
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.940
Sir?

16
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.940
I would like to ask you some questions over there.

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.140
You too, sir...

18
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.240
Wait, please!

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.740
What?

20
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.440
This...

21
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.740
After a while, we were released from police interrogation

22
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.740
and boarded the Tohto Loop Line again.

23
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.140
Look. I wonder if something's wrong?

24
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.640
At Sugame Station, three stations away,

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.140
an incident was already taking place.

26
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940
Brooding over passing seasons

27
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.840
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

28
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.740
The true identity of a friend of justice

29
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.540
was an elderly man who tells picture stories?

30
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:34.071
"A Friend of Justice"

34
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.971
He's Kanemura, a wanted criminal.

35
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.271
He's member of the fraud group, right?

36
00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:45.371
Yes.

37
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.771
By gaining the favor and trust of aged people living alone,

38
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:51.071
he introduces them to non-existent investment deals

39
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.471
and cheat large sums of cash from them.

40
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.371
Many of them committed suicide or running into bankruptcy.

41
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.571
Cause of death is?

42
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.371
A deadly blow on the forehead.

43
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:03.771
That's the only wound found on him.

44
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:06.871
-The culprit is really something. -What?

45
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.871
Because there seems to be no trace of any struggle.

46
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:11.371
Just to think that the culprit finished

47
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:13.271
this strong looking man in one blow.

48
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.371
What brings you both here?

49
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.571
We saw you from the train.

50
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.571
Come, Conan, we don't want to get in the way.

51
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.671
Come over here...

52
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:23.871
You're...

53
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:27.371
"Tokuma Norizuki (75)" -I saw you a while ago.

54
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:30.371
Do you know each other?

55
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:31.971
Yes, just a little bit.

56
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.771
But, what brings you here, sir?

57
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:37.671
He's an eye-witness to this crime.

58
00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:42.371
-What? -Yeah, after I ran into you,

59
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.771
from inside the train,

60
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:47.671
I saw that man strike somebody with a stick.

61
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:50.471
So, I got off at Beika Station and went to the police box.

62
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.471
He's the leader of the fraud group,

63
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:54.071
Teruhiko Kiriya.

64
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:55.971
Could there have been a fall out?

65
00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:58.171
"Teruhiko Kiriya (35)" -I've got nothing to do with this!

66
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:00.671
I was just taking a walk around here!

67
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:03.871
He witnessed it from inside the train?

68
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.471
But...

69
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.371
Sir, where's your cane?

70
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:13.171
I don't really need to use it, so I left it behind.

71
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:15.571
If I have it, everybody treats me like an elderly

72
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:20.371
and people are kind to me, so it's convenient, though.

73
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:24.071
The victim dies from one blow on the forehead.

74
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:25.371
This elderly man who says he witnessed it

75
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.671
from inside the train.

76
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:31.071
Maybe...

77
00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:33.171
How many times do I have to tell you?

78
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:35.171
I'm not the one who did it!

79
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.971
Then, why were you near the scene of the crime?

80
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.271
I got a call.

81
00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:43.771
From a guy who said he was an acquaintance of Kanemura.

82
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:45.871
I was told to come because Kanemura is waiting.

83
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.971
An acquaintance of the victim? Who is it?

84
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:52.271
Beats me. I've never heard his voice before.

85
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.971
Your story's hard to believe.

86
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:57.471
It's true! I...

87
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:59.871
I've been framed!

88
00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:03.371
"Killing Between Comrades?"

89
00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:05.071
A picture storyteller?

90
00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:06.571
You mean, that elderly man?

91
00:06:06.571 --> 00:06:10.871
Yeah. I heard when I was at the local police investigating another case.

92
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.471
It seems he's picture storytelling

93
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.171
to well-behaved children at Sazanka Park.

94
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:16.371
I see...

95
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:19.171
Well, the case seems to be coming to a close.

96
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:22.071
I guess there's nothing for a renowned detective to do at this point.

97
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.271
I hope it goes that way.

98
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:26.871
"The police of jurisdiction" -Yeah.

99
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:30.671
I did see Mr. Mouri here yesterday.

100
00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.871
But I didn't know he was interested in this case.

101
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:38.371
At any rate, he says to please check on what I just told you.

102
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.671
Okay, I got it.

103
00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:43.671
I'll directly take care of the rest.

104
00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:48.671
Now, earth is mine!

105
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.071
No way, King of Darkness!

106
00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:53.971
That voice, don't tell me it's...

107
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:56.871
Friend of Justice is here!

108
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:57.971
King of Darkness!

109
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:00.771
Time to face the punishment of justice!

110
00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:03.871
Ran?

111
00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:08.171
Take this!

112
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:13.171
Then, black light is emitted from the King of Darkness' cane!

113
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:18.271
Watch out! Friend of Justice!

114
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.571
Move it!

115
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:21.571
Show me too! Move it!

116
00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:23.671
Hey! What's with you?

117
00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:26.271
Anybody who comes late line up in the back!

118
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:38.071
Hey! Apologize before you cry!

119
00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:39.871
It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult.

120
00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:43.471
You need to follow the correct path of a man!

121
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:47.871
I'm... I'm sorry.

122
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.071
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:51.571
Okay, good boy.

124
00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:54.871
Everybody, is it okay for him to watch the show with you?

125
00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:56.571
Okay!

126
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:59.071
Then, let him be in the middle.

127
00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:00.371
Thank you!

128
00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:02.371
-Bye bye. -Bye bye.

129
00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:04.971
-Thank you! -See you!

130
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:07.271
Take care of yourself!

131
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.271
It doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult.

132
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:12.071
You scold them when you must.

133
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:16.971
But you need to have the kindness to forgive them too, don't you?

134
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:19.071
It's you, miss.

135
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.371
I forgot to thank you

136
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.971
despite you helping us when we were in danger yesterday.

137
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:25.671
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:28.871
I also didn't get to give this to you either.

139
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:30.571
Thank you!

140
00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:33.271
Is Mitsu, your wife?

141
00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:35.871
There was a time when I used to dream she was.

142
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:39.571
She passed away just the other day, because of an illness.

143
00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:42.671
I'm sorry! I had no idea.

144
00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:45.771
No... Did you come just to bring this to me?

145
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:48.171
No. I was just wondering why you left

146
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:51.771
without giving your name despite having caught a purse snatcher.

147
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.471
I didn't think that I needed to give my name

148
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:57.571
for just doing something like that.

149
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.871
But, you came up during the incident that happened later, right?

150
00:09:01.871 --> 00:09:03.471
Why?

151
00:09:03.471 --> 00:09:04.771
Conan!

152
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:06.771
Because it was a murder.

153
00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:10.471
I just couldn't pretend not seeing what I did, son.

154
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.271
Then, why didn't you report it right away?

155
00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:15.271
Why did you get off at Beika Station?

156
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.171
I don't have a cell phone,

157
00:09:17.171 --> 00:09:20.171
and besides the station master was nowhere nearby.

158
00:09:20.171 --> 00:09:23.271
You didn't get off part way, did you?

159
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.671
Yeah...

160
00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:27.971
It didn't even cross my mind to.

161
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:29.871
Are you satisfied, son?

162
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:32.471
I'll be on my way then.

163
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.671
Thank you, miss.

164
00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:43.971
Conan!

165
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:45.671
Good timing.

166
00:09:45.671 --> 00:09:49.071
I found out about what Mr. Mouri wanted to check on.

167
00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:51.471
About the victims of that fraud group,

168
00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:55.771
some of them were friends of Mr. Norizuki.

169
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:56.771
-What? -What?

170
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:00.471
And, he seems to have 5-dan in kendo.

171
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:01.971
Please wait.

172
00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:04.971
Does dad suspect that old man?

173
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.871
No. I wonder about that.

174
00:10:07.871 --> 00:10:10.171
The culprit's been arrested already, right?

175
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.771
Yes but he's still denying that he did it.

176
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.071
I'll talk to dad!

177
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:17.871
Ran!

178
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:22.171
No! I've got to hurry and find out the truth.

179
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:27.271
Hey, there's one more thing Pops wants you to check on.

180
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:28.371
Again?

181
00:10:31.271 --> 00:10:32.571
The scene of the crime is in between

182
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:36.571
this Natsuhabara Station and Beika Station.

183
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:38.471
It's near Sugame Station.

184
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:42.371
The surveillance camera?

185
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:46.771
Maybe I'll have Officer Takagi check on that too.

186
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.471
"Sugame Station"

187
00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:04.571
This... This is?

188
00:11:14.771 --> 00:11:16.271
Not there yet!

189
00:11:16.271 --> 00:11:17.871
I see!

190
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:19.971
So, that's the story!

191
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:20.971
"The Mouri Detective Agency"

192
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:23.671
Come on, Dad, get up!

193
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:26.371
Wasn't the case coming to a close?

194
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.971
Why are you suspecting that old man?

195
00:11:28.971 --> 00:11:30.671
I have no doubt!

196
00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.871
What? Then, why...

197
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:36.171
I have no doubt that this beer is delicious.

198
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:39.771
Goodness!

199
00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:42.671
I'm sure that the heaven's punished him!

200
00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:46.471
"Witness A" -He brought a lot of suffering to many elderly people!

201
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:49.571
It was just mere punishment from the Friend of Justice!

202
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:51.171
Sir?

203
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:52.571
That's it for now.

204
00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:54.571
Let's take it back to the studio.

205
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:56.971
No way...

206
00:11:56.971 --> 00:11:58.671
Really?

207
00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:06.318
"The police of jurisdiction" -Conan?

208
00:12:06.318 --> 00:12:09.718
No, about that... It's probably going to take a while longer.

209
00:12:09.718 --> 00:12:11.418
But, good timing.

210
00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:14.218
We've just discovered a new fact,

211
00:12:14.218 --> 00:12:16.518
so could you tell Mr. Mouri about it?

212
00:12:16.518 --> 00:12:18.118
A new fact?

213
00:12:24.418 --> 00:12:27.618
"Norizuki"

214
00:12:27.618 --> 00:12:29.418
Excuse me.

215
00:12:35.318 --> 00:12:38.618
Sir? Are you in?

216
00:12:38.618 --> 00:12:40.218
Sir?

217
00:12:43.218 --> 00:12:45.218
A diary?

218
00:12:45.218 --> 00:12:48.818
What? There was another man who was a member of the fraud group?

219
00:12:48.818 --> 00:12:52.718
Right. Takashi Motegi, 25 years old.

220
00:12:52.718 --> 00:12:56.118
It seems that he cheated a large sum of money from a woman

221
00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:59.218
who Mr. Norizuki was very close with.

222
00:12:59.218 --> 00:13:01.418
We're trying to find out his whereabouts right now

223
00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:03.118
but can't seem to find him.

224
00:13:03.118 --> 00:13:04.418
Officer Takagi.

225
00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:06.518
Can you give me the old man's address?

226
00:13:14.718 --> 00:13:15.818
Ran?

227
00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:31.718
"Takashi Motegi (25)"

228
00:13:46.718 --> 00:13:48.818
Don't!

229
00:13:48.818 --> 00:13:51.018
Stop already!

230
00:13:51.018 --> 00:13:54.218
-Sir! -Miss...

231
00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:01.418
I just couldn't believe what was going on.

232
00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:05.818
So, I went to your house wanting to talk to you directly.

233
00:14:05.818 --> 00:14:09.218
I'm sorry, I took the liberty to read it.

234
00:14:09.218 --> 00:14:12.118
This is Mitsu's diary, isn't it?

235
00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:15.418
And, I found what you wrote in it too, sir.

236
00:14:17.418 --> 00:14:19.318
What the heck is this?

237
00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:21.118
You're Takashi Motegi, aren't you?

238
00:14:21.118 --> 00:14:22.318
Police!

239
00:14:22.318 --> 00:14:23.618
We're taking protective custody of you.

240
00:14:23.618 --> 00:14:24.818
What?

241
00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:27.718
Police? Protective custody?

242
00:14:27.718 --> 00:14:32.518
Since that elderly man over there is going after your life.

243
00:14:32.518 --> 00:14:35.318
-Dad? -What?

244
00:14:35.318 --> 00:14:38.918
That's right, isn't it, Inspector?

245
00:14:38.918 --> 00:14:42.918
I heard you told Takagi to put him into protective custody.

246
00:14:42.918 --> 00:14:43.918
What?

247
00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:47.018
I don't remember saying something like that to Takagi...

248
00:14:55.418 --> 00:14:56.718
Mr. Norizuki.

249
00:14:56.718 --> 00:15:00.318
You can't deceive the eyes of this famed detective Kogoro Mouri.

250
00:15:00.318 --> 00:15:04.418
You're the one who killed Mr. Kanemura yesterday, right?

251
00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:06.118
Kogoro Mouri?

252
00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:08.018
Just what do you think you're saying?

253
00:15:08.018 --> 00:15:10.918
I'm the witness to that crime, you know?

254
00:15:10.918 --> 00:15:15.018
I had my doubts about that from the beginning.

255
00:15:15.018 --> 00:15:19.918
You said that you witnessed the crime from the train, however...

256
00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.818
That overpass is a straight line,

257
00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:25.618
so it's impossible to see the scene of the crime right below it!

258
00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:28.818
Certainly.

259
00:15:28.818 --> 00:15:31.318
-Takagi! -Yes, sir!

260
00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:33.018
You mean this, right?

261
00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:35.818
I had the contents of this IC ticket that I borrowed,

262
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:40.418
checked by the data management center of the Tohto Loop Line.

263
00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:43.118
I had no reason to refuse lending it to you.

264
00:15:43.118 --> 00:15:45.818
And, did you find anything?

265
00:15:45.818 --> 00:15:48.318
Before and after the time of the crime yesterday,

266
00:15:48.318 --> 00:15:52.118
entry to Natsuhabara Station was made at 1:35 pm.

267
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.518
Then, the record shows that at 2:15 pm,

268
00:15:53.518 --> 00:15:56.918
this ticket was used to exit Beika Station.

269
00:15:56.918 --> 00:15:59.918
It figures. Exactly.

270
00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.218
-No, that's the strange part. -What?

271
00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:05.518
There's nothing wrong about the entry.

272
00:16:05.518 --> 00:16:08.618
The problem is the exit time.

273
00:16:08.618 --> 00:16:10.518
Conan and Ran got off at Hatabata Station

274
00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:12.518
because of the purse snatcher racket.

275
00:16:12.518 --> 00:16:14.818
But you didn't get off.

276
00:16:16.718 --> 00:16:20.018
Takagi, what time does that train arrive at Beika Station?

277
00:16:20.018 --> 00:16:21.718
At 2:00 pm.

278
00:16:21.718 --> 00:16:23.118
That's strange.

279
00:16:23.118 --> 00:16:26.218
It's 15 minutes earlier than the record indicates.

280
00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:28.018
Which means...

281
00:16:28.018 --> 00:16:32.618
Right, he got off at Sugame Station and carried out his scheme!

282
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.618
Then he got on the next train.

283
00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:38.318
So, that makes for the lost 15 minutes!

284
00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:40.518
That's a very interesting story.

285
00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:44.618
But if it's true, there should be a record of it, right?

286
00:16:44.618 --> 00:16:49.318
No, there is no record of entry or exit at Sugame Station.

287
00:16:49.318 --> 00:16:52.118
Then, why the 15 minutes discrepancy?

288
00:16:52.118 --> 00:16:53.818
I'm embarrassed to say,

289
00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:56.518
that being my age, I have to frequent the men's room.

290
00:16:56.518 --> 00:16:59.418
So, I got off at Beika Station and ran to the men's room.

291
00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:02.518
Therefore, it took me a while to exit Beika Station.

292
00:17:02.518 --> 00:17:04.518
That's the truth.

293
00:17:04.518 --> 00:17:08.418
The truth can be viewed on the camera of the station.

294
00:17:08.418 --> 00:17:10.518
Are you talking about the surveillance camera?

295
00:17:10.518 --> 00:17:13.318
I thought Sugame Station was under renovation

296
00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:15.418
and there was no camera there.

297
00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:17.618
So, you knew about it after all.

298
00:17:17.618 --> 00:17:22.118
Isn't that the reason you decided to commit the crime there?

299
00:17:22.118 --> 00:17:23.518
Another reason is that

300
00:17:23.518 --> 00:17:25.818
there are many aged passengers that use that station,

301
00:17:25.818 --> 00:17:28.418
so you wouldn't look that conspicuous there.

302
00:17:28.418 --> 00:17:31.018
In other words, you called the victim out beforehand

303
00:17:31.018 --> 00:17:34.718
to come under the overpass near Sugame Station

304
00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:37.918
and got off the train without being taken by the camera.

305
00:17:37.918 --> 00:17:39.718
You then attacked Kanemura.

306
00:17:39.718 --> 00:17:42.218
And, boarded the train once more.

307
00:17:42.218 --> 00:17:44.518
Then, you called Kiriya out to a place near the area,

308
00:17:44.518 --> 00:17:47.118
so that he wouldn't have an alibi.

309
00:17:48.418 --> 00:17:51.118
Then, how could I have got on and off the train

310
00:17:51.118 --> 00:17:54.118
at Sugame Station without being recorded?

311
00:17:54.118 --> 00:17:56.818
I had Officer Takagi check the images on the surveillance camera

312
00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:59.618
of Natsuhabara Station.

313
00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:01.918
The camera at Natsuhabara Station?

314
00:18:01.918 --> 00:18:07.718
There was an image of Mr. Norizuki acting strange on the camera.

315
00:18:07.718 --> 00:18:12.218
Back then, you entered the wicket with your IC pass,

316
00:18:12.218 --> 00:18:15.318
but you backed out once and re-entered.

317
00:18:15.318 --> 00:18:17.418
Why did you re-insert your pass?

318
00:18:17.418 --> 00:18:22.818
I wasn't sure if I used the IC ticket correctly.

319
00:18:22.818 --> 00:18:25.218
As you know, aged people aren't good with machines.

320
00:18:25.218 --> 00:18:29.418
Isn't that exactly what you would like us to think?

321
00:18:29.418 --> 00:18:31.018
Just what're you talking about?

322
00:18:31.018 --> 00:18:34.418
Back then, along with your IC pass,

323
00:18:34.418 --> 00:18:36.518
you had a ticket on you too!

324
00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:39.618
A ticket?

325
00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:44.018
He first scanned the IC ticket on the wicket machine,

326
00:18:44.018 --> 00:18:46.318
and pretended to do it once more,

327
00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:48.718
then he inserted the ticket

328
00:18:48.718 --> 00:18:52.218
that he had hidden behind his IC pass.

329
00:18:52.218 --> 00:18:55.618
When pushed by the purse snatcher, his hand touched the wicket.

330
00:18:55.618 --> 00:18:58.918
He then retrieved the ticket that came out of the machine.

331
00:18:58.918 --> 00:19:00.518
Then, he boarded the train,

332
00:19:00.518 --> 00:19:03.718
and got off at Sugame Station to commit the crime!

333
00:19:03.718 --> 00:19:06.518
Then he buys a ticket again and boards the train again.

334
00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:08.018
At Beika Station,

335
00:19:08.018 --> 00:19:12.618
he used the IC pass that he used at Natsuhabara Station and got off.

336
00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.818
The ticket that you bought at Natsuhabara Station

337
00:19:14.818 --> 00:19:18.318
was collected at Sugame Station, where you got off part way.

338
00:19:18.318 --> 00:19:22.018
Your fingerprints should still be left on it.

339
00:19:24.618 --> 00:19:27.618
You're really something, Mr. Detective.

340
00:19:27.618 --> 00:19:30.318
But, I haven't done anything wrong.

341
00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:31.918
He got what he asked for!

342
00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:33.718
Punishment from justice!

343
00:19:33.718 --> 00:19:35.018
No way!

344
00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.018
Ran?

345
00:19:44.418 --> 00:19:46.318
You scold when you have to scold,

346
00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:50.918
but you had the kindness to forgive, sir.

347
00:19:50.918 --> 00:19:53.718
Then, why?

348
00:19:53.718 --> 00:19:55.318
Despite it all,

349
00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:59.018
there are things that can't be forgiven.

350
00:19:59.018 --> 00:20:00.418
Is it because Mitsu

351
00:20:00.418 --> 00:20:03.418
passed away from the shock of being swindled?

352
00:20:03.418 --> 00:20:06.418
Right. Exactly!

353
00:20:06.418 --> 00:20:09.018
I found out that she'd been cheated

354
00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:11.218
for the first time when I read her diary.

355
00:20:11.218 --> 00:20:12.918
I couldn't forgive them!

356
00:20:12.918 --> 00:20:18.118
So I took it upon myself to punish them for the sake of justice!

357
00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:21.218
I understand how you feel.

358
00:20:21.218 --> 00:20:23.718
But, it's not right!

359
00:20:23.718 --> 00:20:26.718
If you read Mitsu's last words,

360
00:20:26.718 --> 00:20:29.318
I'm sure you'd have realized!

361
00:20:29.318 --> 00:20:31.418
Last words?

362
00:20:35.018 --> 00:20:37.118
This is...

363
00:20:37.118 --> 00:20:41.818
Mr. Friend of Justice taught me how to forgive people.

364
00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:46.818
That' why I will forgive the man who deceived me.

365
00:20:46.818 --> 00:20:49.118
He was really nice to me,

366
00:20:49.118 --> 00:20:52.718
who was living alone.

367
00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:54.618
The smiles back then...

368
00:20:54.618 --> 00:20:59.518
I can't believe that they were all untrue.

369
00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:03.018
So, I'm going to believe that he will change his ways someday.

370
00:21:03.018 --> 00:21:06.418
I can't bear to die holding a grudge against someone.

371
00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:10.118
Thank you, Mr. Friend of Justice.

372
00:21:10.118 --> 00:21:12.318
I didn't know.

373
00:21:12.318 --> 00:21:16.018
I was so enraged when I found out about Motegi and his gang.

374
00:21:16.018 --> 00:21:19.518
I was completely blinded by hate!

375
00:21:19.518 --> 00:21:21.818
Such a Friend of Justice, I am.

376
00:21:21.818 --> 00:21:25.418
My eyes were clouded by the hate inside of me.

377
00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:29.418
So I failed to realize how Mitsu really felt!

378
00:21:33.018 --> 00:21:36.818
You mean, she forgave me?

379
00:21:36.818 --> 00:21:38.618
And believed me?

380
00:21:42.418 --> 00:21:45.818
Just as Ran said, no matter what the reason,

381
00:21:45.818 --> 00:21:48.318
there are things that shouldn't be done.

382
00:21:48.318 --> 00:21:50.818
Not as a friend of justice...

383
00:21:50.818 --> 00:21:53.618
Yes, as humans.

384
00:23:14.218 --> 00:23:17.018
"Total confession" -Motegi confessed everything.

385
00:23:17.018 --> 00:23:18.918
"Fraud group demolished" -Kiriya as a suspect of fraud

386
00:23:18.918 --> 00:23:20.718
was arrested once again.

387
00:23:22.618 --> 00:23:26.418
Please step back once and touch the scanner again.

388
00:23:26.418 --> 00:23:28.218
What's the matter, dad?

389
00:23:28.218 --> 00:23:30.318
I'll bet it's broken.

390
00:23:30.318 --> 00:23:33.918
That's why "I see" nothing in ICs!

391
00:23:33.918 --> 00:23:38.018
Hey, isn't that a rental video card?

392
00:23:38.018 --> 00:23:39.918
What?

393
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.218
You're right.

394
00:23:42.218 --> 00:23:45.518
Maybe you're the one who can't see most, Pops?

395
00:23:47.518 --> 00:23:49.218
Mika Tatezato.

396
00:23:49.218 --> 00:23:53.818
I mean, is that person trying to meet with you, dad,

397
00:23:53.818 --> 00:23:56.118
while that person is still on the run as a murderer?

398
00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:58.718
What? What's that noise?

399
00:24:05.018 --> 00:24:08.718
Then... Then, this case has something to do

400
00:24:08.718 --> 00:24:11.618
with the water sprite after all?

401
00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:13.118
Next Conan,

402
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:16.830
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 1)"

403
00:24:17.744 --> 00:24:20.344
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:22.244
"Shoes"

405
00:24:22.244 --> 00:24:23.844
Pops, you've got a job request from a water sprite.

406
00:24:23.844 --> 00:24:25.844
A snatcher? Understood!

407
00:24:25.844 --> 00:24:26.715
It's drunkard.
