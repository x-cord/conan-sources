1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.070
The Youth Detective Squad, accompanied by Ms. Wakasa,

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.370
arrived at a newly opened campground,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.170
There we met Shiraami University basketball team.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.670
Midori Furuoka.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.470
Sumito Ashizawa.

6
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.170
Fumiaki Urushibara.

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.870
Kuninori Danno.

8
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.470
That night, while eating curry for dinner

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.870
with the members of the basketball team...

10
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.870
Do you smell something burning?

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.870
What?

12
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.970
You're right.

13
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.770
Hey, look.

14
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.970
The tent's on fire!

15
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.270
Isn't that Urushibara's tent?

16
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.270
-No way. -Seriously?

17
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.670
Water! Everyone get water!

18
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.370
Hurry!

19
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.970
After finally putting out the fire,

20
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.670
we visited the neighboring tent to ask

21
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.770
about the circumstances under which the fire started...

22
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.370
Chief Kuroda?

23
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.670
Sorry.

24
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.570
I was sleeping with earplugs in.

25
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.670
But I can tell at a glance what's happening.

26
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.370
Let's call the police immediately.

27
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.070
Any objections?

28
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.170
Rumi Wakasa?

29
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.370
Ms. Wakasa...

30
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.170
Ms. Wakasa!

31
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.270
This woman...

32
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.770
Her right eye's blind.

33
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.570
Also, if you look closely at the hardened candles,

34
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.670
there's one with a hole near the tip,

35
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.870
and for some reason there's a V shaped burn

36
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.270
on the cover of the magazine next to the laptop.

37
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.170
Maybe someone set some kind of mechanism.

38
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.570
I see.

39
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.970
You're right.

40
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.570
Which means that person is one of you three...

41
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.170
who visited his tent one at a time.

42
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.170
Oh, my.

43
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.870
Earlier, you said you were sleeping

44
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.770
inside your tent with earplugs in.

45
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.070
No. Actually, while nodding off,

46
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.470
I was watching through a gap in my tent flap

47
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.970
as you cheerfully ate your curry.

48
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.870
Since my tent was right next to the tent that burned,

49
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.670
I remembered the faces and order of the people who came this way.

50
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.570
But since I had earplugs in,

51
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.870
I don't know what the three of them discussed with the victim.

52
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.070
Surely, you didn't ignore the tent engulfed in flames

53
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.670
so you could observe the person you're so interested in, right?

54
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.970
No.

55
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.070
I made the mistake of falling asleep.

56
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.970
So why don't we ask you one by one again?

57
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.070
What did you discuss with the victim then?

58
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.970
When the countdown reaches zero,

59
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.470
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

60
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.770
Both Kuroda and Wakasa are suspicious!

61
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.870
In any case, let's get to the bottom of the fire!

62
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.370
He sees through the one and only truth.

63
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

64
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.270
His name is Detective Conan.

65
00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:18.828
"Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 2)"

66
00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:22.828
By the time I visited Urushibara's tent,

67
00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:25.628
he was already hammered.

68
00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:27.328
"Midori Furuoka (22)" -No matter what I said,

69
00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:30.728
he just shouted, "Shut up, go away" at me.

70
00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:32.828
We didn't have a proper conversation.

71
00:05:32.828 --> 00:05:36.528
Were the lights inside the tent off then?

72
00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:39.928
Yes. It was still light out,

73
00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:42.928
and he said he was going to read comics before going to sleep.

74
00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:47.928
But why'd he have so many candles inside his tent?

75
00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:52.228
No matter how you look at it, that's way too many.

76
00:05:52.228 --> 00:05:57.928
It was his job to bring matches and candles.

77
00:05:57.928 --> 00:06:00.428
-I see. -In that case...

78
00:06:00.428 --> 00:06:04.728
was it also Urushibara's job to bring all those comic books?

79
00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:06.728
Those are mine.

80
00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:10.228
Urushibara said he wanted to read them while camping.

81
00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:14.028
But if I'd known this would happen,

82
00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:17.828
I would've dragged him out of his tent.

83
00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:19.328
I should've made him eat curry with us

84
00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:21.828
instead of reading comics.

85
00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:28.928
When I visited the tent,

86
00:06:28.928 --> 00:06:32.928
he didn't respond no matter how many times I called out to him.

87
00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:36.628
"Sumito Ashizawa (22)" -At first, I thought he was ignoring me,

88
00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:38.528
but after hearing Furuoka's story,

89
00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:41.728
I thought he must've gotten drunk and fallen asleep.

90
00:06:41.728 --> 00:06:45.028
He never wakes up once he passes out from drinking.

91
00:06:45.028 --> 00:06:46.328
It's so bad,

92
00:06:46.328 --> 00:06:49.828
people would draw things on his face during training camps.

93
00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:52.828
Were the lights on inside the tent then?

94
00:06:52.828 --> 00:06:56.028
I don't think so.

95
00:06:56.028 --> 00:06:59.128
But after I left his tent,

96
00:06:59.128 --> 00:07:01.228
the lights suddenly came on.

97
00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:05.128
He was doing squats inside his tent.

98
00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:06.428
Squats?

99
00:07:06.428 --> 00:07:11.528
Yes. He said he always did squats before going to bed.

100
00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:14.228
We saw that, too!

101
00:07:14.228 --> 00:07:17.528
He had his hands behind his head, like this.

102
00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:20.128
He was repeatedly doing bending exercises.

103
00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:22.528
We saw his shadow on the tent wall.

104
00:07:22.528 --> 00:07:25.128
-I see. -If that's true,

105
00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:28.628
then that would mean the victim was still awake then.

106
00:07:28.628 --> 00:07:30.028
Yes.

107
00:07:30.028 --> 00:07:34.428
Which means the last person to visit the victim's tent...

108
00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:35.428
"Kuninori Danno (22)" -Hold on!

109
00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:38.728
I didn't set Urushibara's tent on fire!

110
00:07:38.728 --> 00:07:40.828
When I went to his tent to lure him out

111
00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:42.228
with the smell of curry,

112
00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:46.128
he didn't say anything, just like when Ashizawa visited.

113
00:07:46.128 --> 00:07:48.328
I tried to talk to him,

114
00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:50.328
but he just silently did his squats.

115
00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:52.228
I thought he was doing them while using headphones

116
00:07:52.228 --> 00:07:54.228
to listen to music or something.

117
00:07:55.428 --> 00:07:59.228
Now that I think about it, maybe he did hear me.

118
00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:03.728
It was like he was telling me to go away.

119
00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:07.928
His squatting movements got more and more intense.

120
00:08:07.928 --> 00:08:11.328
His movements got more and more intense?

121
00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:14.928
Why did the victim Urushibara stay in his tent

122
00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:18.628
instead of eating curry with everyone else?

123
00:08:18.628 --> 00:08:21.128
We got into an argument.

124
00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:23.628
He and I had a complicated relationship.

125
00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.028
Complicated how?

126
00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:28.428
Well, during basketball practice, his elbow...

127
00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:29.828
Hey.

128
00:08:29.828 --> 00:08:32.928
Danno claimed he used to be the ace of the basketball team.

129
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:35.628
-Is that true? -Yes, he was.

130
00:08:35.628 --> 00:08:38.728
He received a lot of attention from professional teams

131
00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:41.228
for being able to dunk at his height.

132
00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:45.028
-But... -If not for the injury

133
00:08:45.028 --> 00:08:48.928
he suffered to his right eye at Urushibara's hands,

134
00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:52.828
he may have ended up playing for a foreign team.

135
00:08:52.828 --> 00:08:56.628
But ironically, thanks to that injury,

136
00:08:56.628 --> 00:08:59.628
I was promoted from sub to starter.

137
00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:02.228
Now I'm the ace.

138
00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:04.128
And since Danno quit playing,

139
00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:07.928
he started spending more time with our manager, Furuoka,

140
00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:11.428
and now they're dating.

141
00:09:11.428 --> 00:09:12.928
Yes.

142
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:16.928
Danno was always surrounded by groupies,

143
00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:18.728
but the moment he became a manager,

144
00:09:18.728 --> 00:09:21.628
every last one of them left.

145
00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:25.028
Inspector Yuminaga.

146
00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:28.128
What is it? Did you figure something out?

147
00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:30.728
It's about the tape

148
00:09:30.728 --> 00:09:34.328
on the victim's fingers you asked about.

149
00:09:36.028 --> 00:09:38.228
The surface was burned,

150
00:09:38.228 --> 00:09:40.828
but most of the adhesive side survived,

151
00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:42.928
so we removed it.

152
00:09:42.928 --> 00:09:45.928
We didn't find any trick or mechanism.

153
00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:47.328
I see.

154
00:09:47.328 --> 00:09:49.428
Hey, Inspector Yuminaga.

155
00:09:49.428 --> 00:09:51.928
Could I see that photo?

156
00:09:53.128 --> 00:09:55.328
Yes, sure.

157
00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.928
Thanks.

158
00:09:56.928 --> 00:09:58.628
I knew it.

159
00:09:58.628 --> 00:10:00.428
That person...

160
00:10:00.428 --> 00:10:02.328
Hey, kid.

161
00:10:02.328 --> 00:10:04.728
Did you notice something again?

162
00:10:04.728 --> 00:10:06.028
But...

163
00:10:06.028 --> 00:10:08.028
I could be confused.

164
00:10:09.528 --> 00:10:11.628
Confused?

165
00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:15.728
Hey, guys!

166
00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:22.628
They've completely forgotten about the case.

167
00:10:22.628 --> 00:10:23.928
I did it!

168
00:10:23.928 --> 00:10:25.828
Gosh.

169
00:10:25.828 --> 00:10:28.028
What are you guys doing?

170
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:31.928
Hey, Conan. Ms. Wakasa just showed us.

171
00:10:31.928 --> 00:10:34.528
So we've been making it together.

172
00:10:34.528 --> 00:10:36.228
Look.

173
00:10:36.228 --> 00:10:38.328
A balancing acorn.

174
00:10:42.828 --> 00:10:45.428
That's it. This is it!

175
00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:48.328
This is what the culprit used

176
00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:51.128
to deceive our eyes

177
00:10:51.128 --> 00:10:54.828
and naturally set fire to the tent.

178
00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:00.428
Give us a break, detective.

179
00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:04.328
We're not the ones who set fire to Urushibara's tent.

180
00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:06.828
We did visit his tent one at a time

181
00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:09.428
before it caught fire,

182
00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:12.428
but he didn't answer any of us.

183
00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:15.328
We know Urushibara was inside

184
00:11:15.328 --> 00:11:17.828
since we saw his shadow doing squats on the tent wall,

185
00:11:17.828 --> 00:11:19.628
but we couldn't have set the tent on fire

186
00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:21.828
from the inside unless we'd gone inside.

187
00:11:21.828 --> 00:11:24.328
And the zipper on the tent entrance

188
00:11:24.328 --> 00:11:28.428
was zipped all the way down and locked, right?

189
00:11:28.428 --> 00:11:32.228
Doesn't that make the tent a locked room?

190
00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:34.928
Urushibara was pretty drunk.

191
00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:38.528
Maybe he got drunk while doing squats

192
00:11:38.528 --> 00:11:41.828
and kicked the lantern over?

193
00:11:41.828 --> 00:11:44.528
But what if those candles

194
00:11:44.528 --> 00:11:47.728
could be used to create an automatic ignition device?

195
00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:50.328
-Automatic ignition device? -Automatic ignition device?

196
00:11:50.328 --> 00:11:51.328
That's absurd.

197
00:11:51.328 --> 00:11:53.128
I think he would've noticed immediately

198
00:11:53.128 --> 00:11:55.428
if there were something like that.

199
00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:58.128
After all, he was doing squats.

200
00:11:58.128 --> 00:12:00.228
By that time, Urushibara was probably

201
00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:02.928
already drunk and asleep.

202
00:12:02.928 --> 00:12:03.928
What?

203
00:12:03.928 --> 00:12:07.228
If you think I'm lying, I'll show you

204
00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:10.428
how to make a sleeping man do squats,

205
00:12:10.428 --> 00:12:15.128
and set his tent on fire.

206
00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:30.095
First,

207
00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:33.495
stick a bamboo skewer into the end of a candle.

208
00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:36.895
Then drip wax from another candle onto it.

209
00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:41.295
And stick two candles together.

210
00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:44.695
Sandwich the skewer between them so they make a straight line.

211
00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:48.595
Next, since we poked holes in the tops of candles

212
00:12:48.595 --> 00:12:51.695
set on top of the books,

213
00:12:51.695 --> 00:12:55.695
if you stick both ends of the skewer into the holes...

214
00:12:56.595 --> 00:12:59.895
See? Your candle seesaw is complete.

215
00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:06.395
Now set fire to both ends of the stuck together candles.

216
00:13:06.395 --> 00:13:10.195
The side that burns faster will become lighter and rise.

217
00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:13.195
The side that falls will be exposed to a lot of flame,

218
00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:14.995
making it drip more wax.

219
00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.895
Now this end becomes lighter and rises.

220
00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:20.895
When you repeat that process...

221
00:13:20.895 --> 00:13:23.195
-Amazing. -How interesting.

222
00:13:23.195 --> 00:13:26.895
It seesaws back and forth like the balancing acorns.

223
00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:33.395
Yes. If you use books to block the flame on one side,

224
00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.895
only one flame can be seen rising and falling.

225
00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:39.895
Take a look behind you.

226
00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:43.295
Our shadows on the tent are rising and falling, too.

227
00:13:43.295 --> 00:13:45.695
You're right. They're growing and shrinking.

228
00:13:45.695 --> 00:13:47.895
That's amazing.

229
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:52.895
I see. By linking the victim's hands behind his head,

230
00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:56.895
sitting him in the legless chair,

231
00:13:56.895 --> 00:14:00.995
and placing a large bag against the tent to cover his lower body,

232
00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:02.695
they used the rising and falling flame

233
00:14:02.695 --> 00:14:06.695
to make his shadow look like he was doing squats.

234
00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:07.995
In other words,

235
00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:12.195
the strange V shaped burn on the magazine was created

236
00:14:12.195 --> 00:14:15.395
because it was placed on top of the laptop

237
00:14:15.395 --> 00:14:18.795
in order to block the light from one end of the candle,

238
00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:20.795
and only the inside was exposed to the flame

239
00:14:20.795 --> 00:14:24.295
when it first caught fire.

240
00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:28.795
Then what about all the candles that melted together?

241
00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:31.295
The culprit probably scattered them

242
00:14:31.295 --> 00:14:32.995
next to the contraption beforehand,

243
00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:35.495
in order to conceal their trick.

244
00:14:35.495 --> 00:14:37.295
I see.

245
00:14:37.295 --> 00:14:39.195
Finally, by knocking the laptop over with water

246
00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:41.895
while putting out the flames,

247
00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:45.395
they were able to reduce all evidence of their trick to ashes.

248
00:14:45.395 --> 00:14:49.195
But that candle's just moving up and down.

249
00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:52.295
That wouldn't set fire to anything.

250
00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:53.995
It does.

251
00:14:53.995 --> 00:14:55.295
As time goes on,

252
00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:58.795
the movements of the contraption become more intense.

253
00:14:58.795 --> 00:15:01.995
If you set some flammable clothes on the floor...

254
00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:05.695
It caught fire.

255
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.195
It's dangerous, so don't do this at home.

256
00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:15.795
Okay...

257
00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:20.695
Which means this trick...

258
00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:25.495
Midori Furuoka who claimed the light was out so the victim could sleep

259
00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:28.095
when she visited his tent.

260
00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:31.395
Kuninori Danno, who visited the tent after the victim started doing squats,

261
00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.995
couldn't have set it up.

262
00:15:33.995 --> 00:15:37.195
Which means the man claiming the lights were out

263
00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:39.195
when he visited the tent,

264
00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:41.395
but looking back after he left,

265
00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:45.995
saw that the victim had turned on the lights and begun doing squats.

266
00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:47.995
Sumito Ashizawa.

267
00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.795
You're the only one.

268
00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:51.895
Seriously?

269
00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:54.095
Is it true, Ashizawa?

270
00:15:54.095 --> 00:15:55.795
No.

271
00:15:55.795 --> 00:16:02.595
Urushibara's tent was zipped all the way shut and locked, right?

272
00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:05.195
How could I have gotten inside?

273
00:16:05.195 --> 00:16:07.495
The mud on your right elbow.

274
00:16:09.295 --> 00:16:10.995
When did that get there?

275
00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:15.095
This is...

276
00:16:15.095 --> 00:16:19.895
Most likely it happened while the victim was passed out,

277
00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:23.995
you made a cut in the tent with a sharp object,

278
00:16:23.995 --> 00:16:26.695
and touched the ground with your right elbow

279
00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:31.195
while forcing your way in.

280
00:16:31.195 --> 00:16:32.495
I see.

281
00:16:32.495 --> 00:16:33.795
Once the tent burned,

282
00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:36.895
the cut would disappear along with it.

283
00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:40.795
No, this mud got on me when I tripped earlier.

284
00:16:40.795 --> 00:16:44.395
Then why did you remove the tape from your right hand?

285
00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:49.295
This guy had tape on his right hand, right?

286
00:16:49.295 --> 00:16:52.295
Yes, on his pointer finger.

287
00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:54.795
We saw it when he was holding the curry ladle.

288
00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:57.795
I believe Urushibara had some on his right pointer

289
00:16:57.795 --> 00:17:00.795
and middle fingers, too.

290
00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:03.595
What about Urushibara's left hand?

291
00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:04.895
Well...

292
00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:07.495
He didn't have any tape on his left hand.

293
00:17:13.395 --> 00:17:16.195
But Urushibara's charred corpse

294
00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:19.595
had tape on both hands, which means...

295
00:17:22.495 --> 00:17:26.895
The culprit removed their own tape and put it on him

296
00:17:26.895 --> 00:17:31.595
in order to keep the passed out Urushibara's hands

297
00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:35.095
linked behind his head.

298
00:17:38.095 --> 00:17:39.995
If that's true,

299
00:17:39.995 --> 00:17:43.395
then we might find on the adhesive surface of the tape

300
00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:46.095
on the body's left hand

301
00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:50.095
bits of your skin and hair that contain your DNA.

302
00:17:51.795 --> 00:17:56.195
If you haven't thrown away the knife you used to cut the tent,

303
00:17:56.195 --> 00:18:00.195
the fibers from the victim's tent should be on that, too.

304
00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:04.895
Yes.

305
00:18:04.895 --> 00:18:07.395
I've still got it.

306
00:18:11.095 --> 00:18:12.195
Stay back!

307
00:18:12.195 --> 00:18:14.495
Come any closer, and I'll stab her!

308
00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:16.095
Ayumi!

309
00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:19.695
That's right.

310
00:18:19.695 --> 00:18:23.895
I'm the one who set fire to Urushibara's tent!

311
00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.495
But why?

312
00:18:25.495 --> 00:18:28.495
You had no reason to resent Urushibara!

313
00:18:28.495 --> 00:18:30.395
No.

314
00:18:30.395 --> 00:18:32.995
But he had dirt on me.

315
00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:35.195
-Dirt? -Yes.

316
00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:39.695
I'm the one who asked Urushibara

317
00:18:39.695 --> 00:18:43.695
to hurt Danno so I could play.

318
00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:44.895
What?

319
00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:50.195
I wasn't expecting it to be a career-ending injury,

320
00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.895
but he was constantly threatening me.

321
00:18:52.895 --> 00:18:54.995
When I went to his tent today,

322
00:18:54.995 --> 00:18:58.395
he drunkenly slurred,

323
00:18:58.395 --> 00:19:00.895
"If you don't want me to spill the beans,

324
00:19:00.895 --> 00:19:05.295
you'd better make lots of money for me once you go pro."

325
00:19:05.295 --> 00:19:08.195
Since he stopped responding,

326
00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:11.795
I entered his tent and set up that trick.

327
00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:14.295
Fortunately, everything I needed for it

328
00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:17.595
was inside his tent.

329
00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:21.195
But it's over now.

330
00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:23.495
There's a cliff through the woods.

331
00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.595
I don't want to die alone,

332
00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:29.595
so let's jump together, kid.

333
00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:38.795
-Ayumi! -Hang in there, Ayumi!

334
00:19:38.795 --> 00:19:42.195
Hurry up and use your tranquilizer watch and soccer ball.

335
00:19:42.195 --> 00:19:44.495
They're both inside our tent.

336
00:19:49.495 --> 00:19:51.495
Hey, you...

337
00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:54.895
Stay back!

338
00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:57.795
Let go of my student.

339
00:19:57.795 --> 00:20:00.095
I told you to stay back!

340
00:20:00.095 --> 00:20:01.795
I'll say it again.

341
00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:04.595
Let go of my student.

342
00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:09.095
If you refuse...

343
00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:13.395
Stab her.

344
00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:17.795
Go on. Stab her.

345
00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:21.795
Just like you used that box cutter to slice the tent.

346
00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:23.395
Do it.

347
00:20:23.395 --> 00:20:26.395
Or should I...

348
00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:28.795
help you?

349
00:20:42.695 --> 00:20:45.995
Yoshida! Wake up, Yoshida!

350
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.595
Are you all right, Yoshida?

351
00:20:47.595 --> 00:20:49.295
Can you hear me? It's your teacher!

352
00:20:49.295 --> 00:20:51.095
Yoshida!

353
00:20:54.595 --> 00:20:56.095
Ms. Wakasa.

354
00:20:57.095 --> 00:20:58.795
I was so scared!

355
00:20:58.795 --> 00:21:00.595
Ms. Wakasa!

356
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.595
Thank you, Ms. Wakasa,

357
00:21:05.595 --> 00:21:07.895
for distracting the suspect.

358
00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:12.095
If we let a child get stabbed before our eyes,

359
00:21:12.095 --> 00:21:15.595
the chief and I would've been worse than fired.

360
00:21:15.595 --> 00:21:17.095
No problem.

361
00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:22.095
I couldn't hear what you said to distract him, though.

362
00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:24.295
Really?

363
00:23:04.995 --> 00:23:07.195
Hey. Did you see that, Haibara?

364
00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:08.495
See what?

365
00:23:08.495 --> 00:23:13.195
The suspect's face just before he was arrested by Chief Kuroda.

366
00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:16.795
Yes, it was pretty contorted.

367
00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:19.495
Maybe he was overcome by the spirit of a teacher

368
00:23:19.495 --> 00:23:21.295
looking out for her student.

369
00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:24.695
Have you not noticed her right eye?

370
00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:28.995
Just so you know, I like Ms. Wakasa.

371
00:23:28.995 --> 00:23:31.395
Don't say anything disparaging about her.

372
00:23:31.395 --> 00:23:32.795
What?

373
00:23:43.195 --> 00:23:45.795
There's dirt on her pocket.

374
00:23:45.795 --> 00:23:47.695
I can see a shape.

375
00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:52.095
What is that?

376
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.795
"Next episode" -I'm sure you haven't forgotten, Mouri,

377
00:23:56.795 --> 00:23:58.495
about how much trouble you caused me

378
00:23:58.495 --> 00:24:01.795
when you worked under me in investigations.

379
00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:03.995
Inspector.

380
00:24:03.995 --> 00:24:07.795
That's why I'm asking for your help.

381
00:24:07.795 --> 00:24:12.095
Ryuji Maehama was threatening Hide Tenyama in Sasago-cho.

382
00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:15.795
At this rate, we're going to have to drop the charges,

383
00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:17.995
even though we know he's the culprit.

384
00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:24.295
Next Conan, "The Job Request From Inspector Megure"

385
00:24:24.738 --> 00:24:27.638
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:27.638 --> 00:24:29.138
"Siren"

387
00:24:29.138 --> 00:24:30.638
-Ms. Wakasa! -Thank you.

388
00:24:30.638 --> 00:24:31.938
What should we play next?

389
00:24:31.938 --> 00:24:34.238
What about your summer assignments?
