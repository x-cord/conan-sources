1
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,530
I've always known this day would come.

2
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,820
Detective Takagi finally did it!

3
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,860
But...

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,360
It was announced so suddenly...

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,820
Will he really come?

6
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,900
It's an anonymous tip-off.

7
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,280
The chances are slim.

8
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,070
This is the man, right?

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,740
(Culprit of bombing 3 years ago is apprehended)

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,340
(One police officer dead)
The one who caused your classmate to...

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,280
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,650
It's bothering me.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,250
(Related to the bombing incident)
He might be skilled in bombs,

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,260
(seven years ago?)
but I didn't think he'd have the ability

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
to plan and execute an escape.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,860
In other words...

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,900
Wow!

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,860
Detective Sato is beautiful!

19
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,360
Someday, Ran and I...

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,820
What's wrong, Conan?

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,650
Huh? I-It's nothing!

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,980
This kid is thinking
of marrying you, isn't he?

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,030
No way!

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,150
She's right...

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,400
Wataru Takagi, do you promise

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,730
to protect and make Miwako happy
for the rest of your life?

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,110
I do!

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,070
Miwako, do you promise

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,480
- Help me!
- to be a pillar of support

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,070
- What was that?
- to Wataru no matter what,

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,570
and continue to love him
for the rest of your life?

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,280
- I--
- Miwako!

33
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,400
If you're marrying that jerk,
then I might as well kill you!

34
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Restrain them!

35
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,400
- Uncle?
- Move aside!

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,070
H-Hold on!

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,280
That hurts, you idiot!

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,690
What's going on?!

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,980
Capture him!

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,070
This is bad!

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,480
Darn! These aren't the right shoes...

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,030
Kazami! Step aside!

43
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,730
Save me!

44
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,110
Kazami, are you okay...

45
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,400
Kazami!

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,650
Takagi!

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,940
End of the drill!

48
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,610
Huh?

49
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,280
What? Did we lose?

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,940
Really?

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,900
What were you guys doing?

52
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,610
The groom got shot!

53
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,690
Let's revise the security formation!

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,730
This paint won't come off easily, huh?

55
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,650
What's wrong, Sato?

56
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,570
N-Nothing's wrong.

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,610
What is going on?!

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,610
This doesn't make sense.

59
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,150
Isn't this supposed to be Detective Takagi
and Detective Sato's wedding ceremony?

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,570
Oh no, I'm sorry.

61
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,530
I wanted the drill to be as real as possible,
so you weren't told anything.

62
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,610
Hey, hey...

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,610
Tsutomu Muranaka, the former Senior
Superintendent, is going to get married.

64
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,980
The police and Mouri are in charge
of the security for his wedding.

65
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,610
Dad, you knew about this?

66
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,320
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- That's why you were able to act quickly...

67
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,860
You and Former Senior Superintendent
Muranaka were from the same year, right?

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,110
Yeah, among all of us,
he was the most successful.

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,190
He got injured a few years ago
and left the force.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,610
Then, he met his now-fiancée
at the hospital he was in.

71
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,820
I was worried because
he never contacted me after he left.

72
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,980
Frankly speaking, I was shocked.

73
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,730
But why is Division 1 responsible
for the security of the ceremony?

74
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,730
Muranaka received a threat.

75
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,860
When he was in service,
he arrested many criminals.

76
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,980
A lot of people still resent him even now.

77
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,780
So they are out for vengeance?

78
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,650
Indeed.

79
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,820
That's why we requested
to let us take charge of security.

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,860
We know the faces
of the criminals Muranaka arrested.

81
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,690
I thought that

82
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,110
if it does happen,
we'd be able to handle it...

83
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,110
Are you alright, Miwako?

84
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
I'll bring some water.

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,610
It's been three years...

86
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,980
As I thought, it was you.

87
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,110
If he escapes, then I would show up.

88
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,190
That's what you predicted, right?

89
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,690
What's wrong, Detective Sato?

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,280
Conan...

91
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,900
It's nothing...

92
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,400
Even if I say that,
you'd see right through me, huh?

93
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,070
When Takagi collapsed earlier...

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,570
I saw 'that' again...

95
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,230
'That'?

96
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,400
What do you mean by 'that'?

97
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,190
The one trying to take Takagi away...

98
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,650
The Grim Reaper.

99
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,360
My name is Shinichi Kudo,
a high school detective.

100
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,360
When I went to the theme park
with my childhood friend, Ran,

101
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,400
I witnessed a suspicious transaction
between some men dressed in black.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
As I was engrossed in watching them,

103
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,360
I didn't notice one of them
closing up on me from behind.

104
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,440
I was drugged, and when I woke up...

105
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,690
My body shrunk!

106
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,320
If they knew Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

107
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,650
they'd come after me and
endanger people around me.

108
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,280
Professor Agasa advised me
to hide my real identity.

109
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,230
When Ran asked for my name,

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,030
I blurted the name Conan Edogawa.

111
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,150
To get the information on those men in black,

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,610
I started living at Ran's place
along with her father, a private detective.

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,110
These are Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Ayumi.

114
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,860
They are my classmates after I turned small.

115
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,400
She is Ai Haibara.

116
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,530
She was a scientist at the Black Organization

117
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,820
and she invented the drug
that made me small, Apotoxin 4869.

118
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,650
However, when her sister was murdered,
she rebelled against the organization.

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,150
As she took the drug
in an attempt to end her life,

120
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,530
her body shrunk.

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,980
She now lives at Professor Agasa's place

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,610
to escape from the eyes of the organization.

123
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,940
Within the Black Organization is this man,

124
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,110
Tooru Amuro.

125
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,360
However, his real identity is 'Zero',

126
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,730
an agent of a secret department
that commands the Public Security Bureau.

127
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,400
His real name is Rei Furuya.

128
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,150
He works undercover in
the Black Organization to gather information.

129
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,440
He graduated the Police Academy a year before

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,780
Detective Takagi’s girlfriend,
Detective Sato.

131
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,650
It seems like he had four other
mischievous friends, but…

132
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,070
Hey, Conan!

133
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,030
You've said too much!

134
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,110
You're clearly exposing the plot!

135
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,110
Just say the line you always do.

136
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,690
O-Oh...

137
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,030
Even though my body shrunk,
my intelligence remains!

138
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,440
The greatest, undefeated detective!

139
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,280
There's only one truth!

140
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,650
Jinpei... Matsuda...

141
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,860
(Where are you?)

142
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,650
(Where are you? Please)

143
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,360
(Where are you? Please, come back.)

144
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,610
A-Ah...

145
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,030
I wanted to have a feast at the wedding...

146
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,940
I'd never expected it to be a drill!

147
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,530
But Detective Sato was so beautiful!

148
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,230
A wedding dress is always special to women.

149
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,360
Edogawa seems to be imagining
a certain someone in a wedding dress.

150
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,360
Wha--

151
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,860
Wow! Who's that someone?

152
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,860
Who is it?

153
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,030
Is it Ms. Kobayashi?

154
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,570
What? Why?

155
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,400
Anyway, what have you guys been making?

156
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,690
Cosplay costumes for Halloween!

157
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,400
We're all going to have fun wearing these!

158
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,940
Of course, Conan and Haibara, too!

159
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,650
- What?!
- Eh?!

160
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,900
H-Hold on!

161
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,030
I won't wear something like that--

162
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,280
W-What was that?!

163
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,900
What is this hole?!

164
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,690
Ouch...

165
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,400
Professor!

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,780
Ah, my bad, my bad. I've startled you.

167
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
What did you do now?

168
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
This.

169
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,530
Is that Conan's ball dispensing belt?

170
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,320
I was trying to reform it so it'd
dispense a giant ball, but it didn't go well.

171
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,820
It's almost done.

172
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,480
The balance between the surface's elasticity
and toughness needs some tuning...

173
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,400
Forget that, I almost
got injured falling down here!

174
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,280
Sorry, sorry. Are you alright?

175
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,030
I won't forgive you!
Treat me to rice with grilled eel!

176
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm afraid I can't agree to that.

177
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,360
There's someone who can treat you right now.

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,030
Are you kidding me?!

179
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,980
Why do I have to treat these kids?!

180
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,480
It's fine to treat them
once in a while, isn't it?

181
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,860
Thank you for the treat!

182
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,820
(Metropolitan Police Department)
I only said I'm going to have lunch here

183
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,650
because I have to come to
the MPD to talk about the drill yesterday.

184
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,440
Won't lunch be more delicious
if we all eat together?

185
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,110
I want tempura!

186
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,360
Me, too!

187
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,570
Grilled eel for me!

188
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,280
I want rice with grilled eel!

189
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,530
Sounds great!

190
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,900
Hey! That's enough!

191
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,940
Hey.

192
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,980
You dropped this.

193
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,650
Haibara!

194
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,110
Dad!

195
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,610
Uncle!

196
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,190
- Haibara!
- Uncle! Get a hold of yourself! Uncle!

197
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,030
I am alright.

198
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,230
But...

199
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,570
Uncle!

200
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,610
Big Sis Ran!

201
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,480
Call the ambulance!

202
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,280
O-Okay.

203
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,900
Watch out!

204
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,030
Hurry and put it out!

205
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,690
Darn, I can't get close!

206
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,940
I'll be at Professor Agasa's place
after the investigation is done.

207
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:56,980
Sure.

208
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
Then he blew up in flames in front of you?

209
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,110
Yes.

210
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,320
Haibara,

211
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,690
before it happened, you picked up a note
and passed it to him, right?

212
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes, but I didn't see what was written on it.

213
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,030
Didn't you talk to him then?

214
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,610
Hmm... Let me think.

215
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,320
"Thank you for picking it up."

216
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,730
"It's a really important note.
I need to give it to someone."

217
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,150
He told me in Russian.

218
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,980
- An important note...
- That's amazing.

219
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,900
You understand Russian?

220
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,610
At the very least,

221
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,730
it doesn't seem like it's the
Black Organization targeting Haibara.

222
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,820
It doesn't look like
an accident or a natural occurrence.

223
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,110
It must've been targeted at the victim.

224
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,900
The tablet he was holding
is likely to be the source of explosion.

225
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,030
There's something in the bag's side pocket.

226
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,860
Hmm, you're right.

227
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,070
Looks like a name card.

228
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,360
T-That's...

229
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,940
I've inquired about
how the incident happened.

230
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,030
What is it?

231
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,820
Look at this.

232
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,030
(Sgt. Jinpei Matsuda)
T-That's...

233
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,530
Jinpei Matsuda.

234
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,360
(Jinpei Matsuda)
An ex-detective in charge of robbery cases at

235
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
CID 1 of Metropolitan Police Department.

236
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,610
Three years ago, he was transferred to
CID 1 due to a certain case.

237
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,190
When he was investigating
a serial bombing case,

238
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,650
a bomb detonated
and he died in the line of duty.

239
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,900
'Criminal Investigations Division 1'
is written on the card...

240
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,070
He was only in Division 1 for about a week.

241
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,110
Where and when did
the victim get this name card?

242
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,280
It's right in front of the MPD, huh?

243
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,110
A protest against the police?

244
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm shocked!

245
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,440
Seriously, they need to leave us out of it!

246
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,190
In conclusion,

247
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,230
the identity of the victim is unknown.

248
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,400
We are currently making a facial composite
based on the testimony from the children.

249
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,070
We haven't found the note
dropped by the victim, have we?

250
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,980
Looking at the size of the fire,

251
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,940
it's likely that
the note was lost in the fire.

252
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,900
Our only lead at the moment
is this name card.

253
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,860
So this is how Matsuda looked like.

254
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,110
I see.

255
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,690
Chiba, you were transferred here
after Matsuda was killed in the line of duty.

256
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,280
If we cover his eyes,
he does look like Takagi.

257
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,190
Yeah.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,530
When Takagi put on a disguise for a stakeout,
he looked exactly like Matsuda.

259
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

260
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,150
For now, we've brought
the daily reports for that period.

261
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,280
Sato, you were in the same group
as Matsuda when he was here.

262
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,190
Can you think of anything?

263
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,190
No.

264
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,480
If he'd handed his name card to a foreigner,
I would have remembered...

265
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,230
Leave the information gathering to the others.

266
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,820
Please focus on recalling
what happened during that time.

267
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,980
Understood.

268
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,650
Did you think I wouldn’t notice?

269
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,820
Knowing how you always are,
you must've been eavesdropping.

270
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,820
Y-Yes.

271
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,940
Come in.

272
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,190
I don't have to look at these to
remember the week I spent with him.

273
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,360
Keep this a secret from Takagi.

274
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,730
(Daily Report)
He was an amazing detective, wasn't he?

275
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,980
Detective Matsuda, I mean.

276
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,030
Yes.

277
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,690
He was arrogant and had a sharp tongue.

278
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,030
But...

279
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,980
If it's okay, can you tell me

280
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,190
about Detective Matsuda?

281
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,280
Huh?

282
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,780
While you talk, you might
recall something, right?

283
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,690
Yes...

284
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,940
You're right.

285
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,650
He joined CID 1
three years ago, on November 1.

286
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,150
I remember because it was the day after Halloween.

287
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,360
But he was transferred here so suddenly,
so the name cards were not ready yet.

288
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,610
I handed them to him
on the morning of November 4.

289
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,980
I remember because
it was the day after a national holiday.

290
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,690
Matsuda died on November 7.

291
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,190
So he could have only
handed it out during these four days.

292
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,570
But we worked in the office on the fourth,

293
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,530
and on the fifth we only went between
the detention center and prison.

294
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,730
On the seventh, we went after the serial
bomber until before he passed away.

295
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,690
Which means, he only had the chance
to hand out the name card on...

296
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,070
Yes, only on November 6.

297
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,480
But there's a possibility that
he handed it to someone after work, right?

298
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,480
He didn't return to the dormitory
for the week he was in our division,

299
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,320
just stayed over at the HQ.

300
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,150
Thinking about it now,

301
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,110
he might have been investigating
the serial bombing case.

302
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,440
But I don't recall
anything special happening...

303
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,110
We caught a robber,

304
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,650
stopped a bus from going out of control,

305
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,280
and stopped someone
from jumping off a building.

306
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,860
I think all these happened in the morning?

307
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,780
We did some information gathering
in the afternoon.

308
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,480
(Three Years Ago)
What kind of persuasion was that?

309
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,570
It's great that she was saved,

310
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,400
but I was so afraid she would've been
provoked and jumped off.

311
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,230
Can you at least listen to me a bit?

312
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,070
Typing a message?

313
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,070
You're pretty fast.

314
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,320
I just happen to be good with my fingers.

315
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,150
Is it your girlfriend?

316
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,280
Nope. It's for my best friend.

317
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,360
Though I know he's not
going to write back to me.

318
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,320
He won't read it?

319
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,820
He was blown away four years ago.

320
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,730
What?

321
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,820
A murder case at Beika third street.

322
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,940
The culprit is escaping on a bike.

323
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,820
Roger that, we will go after him!

324
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,400
As I thought, this town isn't ordinary.

325
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,860
Interrogation for that case
ended at about three p.m.

326
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,940
After that, we returned to Sakuradamon.

327
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,940
Did Detective Matsuda go through
the interrogation together with you?

328
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,530
No, we did it separately...

329
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,860
Sorry to keep you waiting.

330
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,360
Where did you go?

331
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,070
It's past six.

332
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,280
I had something.

333
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,690
That's...

334
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,650
What's wrong?

335
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,780
I just remembered,
Matsuda had prayer beads in his pocket.

336
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,860
Prayer beads...

337
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
The person you mentioned earlier,
the one Detective Matsuda was texting...

338
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,360
Probably it's someone from his year
who was in the Explosive Disposal Unit...

339
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,070
Kenji Hagiwara.

340
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,960
(Kenji Hagiwara)
He was killed

341
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
in the line of duty
while defusing a bomb seven years ago.

342
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,690
The date of his death was...

343
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,030
November 7, same as Matsuda!

344
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,110
The seventh was the day
the serial bomber contacted the police.

345
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,610
He was at the HQ until
the bomber contacted the police, right?

346
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,190
He couldn't visit Hagiwara's grave that day.

347
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,780
So he went on the sixth, didn't he?

348
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,980
If I'm not mistaken, Hagiwara's grave
is in a temple near Shibuya.

349
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,610
Sato, what's wrong?

350
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,230
Take care of this!

351
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
P-Please wait!

352
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,480
Hey, Takagi!

353
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,320
The interrogation ended at three p.m.

354
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,360
Even if he'd gone to visit
his friend's grave,

355
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,070
it still took him too long
to be returning after six...

356
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,280
What happened during those three hours?

357
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,820
Why are you here, Conan?!

358
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,900
(Getsusan Temple)
Ah, yes.

359
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,030
I remember them very well.

360
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,230
Until a few years ago,
four of them always came together.

361
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,110
Four of them?

362
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,400
(Hagiwara Family Tomb)
They said they were Hagiwara's classmates.

363
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,400
Do you remember the time
they came here, three years ago?

364
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,610
What time were they here?

365
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,360
Every year, they came at about three p.m.

366
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,320
But for some reason,

367
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,730
the number of people decreased recently,
and only one came last year...

368
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,860
It feels quite lonely.

369
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,820
Do you know the name of that one person?

370
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,780
If I remember correctly, his name was...

371
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,610
Yes!

372
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,730
I think his name was Furuya.

373
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,900
(Metropolitan Police Department Police Academy Graduate List)
Rei Furuya...

374
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,940
(Search)

375
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,780
("Furuya Rei" returned no search results.)

376
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,730
No matter where I search, this is all I get.

377
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,480
Does this Furuya guy really exist?

378
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,860
He was Matsuda's classmate.

379
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,690
Even if he'd quit the police force,
there should be a record...

380
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,610
Assistant Police Inspector Sato
and Police Sergeant Takagi.

381
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,650
You are...

382
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,030
Kazami from the
Public Security Bureau of Tokyo MPD.

383
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,530
May I have a word with you?

384
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,820
Stop the investigation?

385
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,230
The Public Security Bureau
will take over this case.

386
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,570
What are you talking about?!

387
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,070
This is under our jurisdiction!

388
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,070
You have no say in this.

389
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,900
This is not a request, but an order.

390
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,730
This is the end of our conversation.

391
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
They can't be serious!

392
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,480
This tyranny is unacceptable!

393
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,650
Please calm down!

394
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,940
This is frustrating,
but we can't do anything.

395
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,360
I am calm!

396
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,650
Don't spout nonsense!

397
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,280
B-But...

398
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm going to negotiate!

399
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,860
U-Uh...

400
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,820
Sato!

401
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,110
She got so worked up, because...

402
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,940
It involves Matsuda,
and she can't keep her cool.

403
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,030
Shiratori!

404
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,360
That's quite an expression on your face.

405
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Y-Yeah…

406
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,570
She hasn't been aware of anything around her

407
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,860
ever since she saw Matsuda's name card...

408
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,980
Shiratori, you said this before...

409
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,400
If she's still preoccupied
about her past with Matsuda,

410
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,230
we have no chance to win.

411
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,030
I did. But I was wrong.

412
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,610
The one with no chance to win is me.

413
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,650
Am I wrong?

414
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,400
A-Ah...

415
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,480
But I'm still not good enough...

416
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,900
But you have advanced a fair bit.

417
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,110
A-Advanced?

418
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,280
You're jealous of

419
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,030
a legendary detective
who risked his life to save a lot of lives.

420
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,360
No, I am not jealous...

421
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,230
It doesn't matter if it involves Matsuda.

422
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,360
If our case was stolen,
we just have to take it back.

423
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,860
Hurry up, or else Sato will be yelling
at the Public Security by herself.

424
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,110
Excuse me.

425
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,400
Thank you very much!

426
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
Well, I felt quite obligated
because I did disrupt your romance...

427
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,940
Ah, Ms. Kobayashi!

428
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,650
(Hibiya Emergency Hospital)

429
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,440
He doesn't have a bone fracture,

430
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,610
but he suffered a strong blow on his head.

431
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,070
He needs to undergo a thorough check-up
after moving to another hospital tomorrow.

432
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,280
Uncle...

433
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,980
Coming.

434
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,820
May I know who is this?

435
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,860
(Tsutomu Muranaka
Christine Richard)
My name is Tsutomu Muranaka.

436
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,690
This is my fiancée...

437
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,480
My name is Christine Richard.

438
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,150
Mr. Muranaka and Ms. Christine...

439
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,820
Ah, from the drill yesterday!

440
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,900
I didn't know Megure did that.

441
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,900
Apologies for troubling everyone.

442
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,230
Not at all, please don't mention it.

443
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm just a little surprised...

444
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,480
I'd like to apologize as well.

445
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,360
It's alright.

446
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,610
Ah, your Japanese is fluent!

447
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,980
Both of my parents are French,
but I've been living in Japan since I was 20.

448
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,320
I met her at the hospital.

449
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,980
When I was hospitalized
for an injured shoulder.

450
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,480
I was troubled because I lost
my patient ID card, and he found it for me.

451
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,400
It was a fateful encounter!

452
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,570
Well, something like that.

453
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,530
Why are you here today?

454
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,650
Actually, I asked Detective Mouri
to give a speech at our wedding.

455
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Both of us are huge fans
of the Sleeping Kogoro.

456
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,070
I see!

457
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,280
I can't let this go.

458
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,070
To think they targeted Detective Mouri.

459
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,320
I don't think they were going after my father.

460
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,570
He was just protecting
a child from the explosion...

461
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,780
What?

462
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,070
The child picked up something
that the victim had dropped,

463
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,610
and just as she handed it over,
the victim burst up in flames.

464
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,980
My father tried to help her and...

465
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,780
Sleeping Kogoro is a hero
who saved the child.

466
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,940
That's right.

467
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,070
Sorry to come uninvited
during such a difficult time.

468
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,650
When he's awake, please send
our regards to Detective Mouri.

469
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,690
Of course.

470
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,360
Thank you very much.

471
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,690
Speaking of which,
the wedding venue is gorgeous!

472
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,780
Isn't it?

473
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,860
It gives a panoramic view of Shibuya,
so I chose it at first sight.

474
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,570
Ah... The weather was bad yesterday...

475
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,650
It was foggy, so we didn't get a clear view.

476
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,690
Then, would you like to
check out the venue tomorrow?

477
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,530
Hey, Detective Mouri is like this...

478
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,860
But... It's such a pity if we don't get to
see the beautiful Halloween decorations.

479
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,150
Please?

480
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,110
Well,

481
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,780
if you put it that way...

482
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,860
Thank you very much!

483
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,780
Well, see you tomorrow.

484
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,820
I heard from Dad that

485
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,730
Mr. Muranaka was a really strict person so

486
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,530
he was feared as the Demon Muranaka.

487
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Is that so?

488
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,030
It's hard to imagine that
from the Mr. Muranaka we met.

489
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,690
I'm sure that Ms. Christine
has changed him into a gentle person.

490
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,190
It's getting late...

491
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,440
I think it's time for us to head home.

492
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,980
Big Sis Ran,

493
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,570
I'll be staying over at
Professor Agasa’s place,

494
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,780
so you can stay here with Uncle.

495
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,480
But...

496
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,280
Don't worry, I'll be fine by myself.

497
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,650
Thank you.

498
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,360
Take care, then.

499
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,400
Okay.

500
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,780
You're there, aren't you?

501
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Anything you need from me?

502
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,900
Great work.

503
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Thanks for your hard work.

504
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,980
I-I'll help out as well.

505
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,780
You don't have to force yourself.

506
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm not forcing myself.

507
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,110
The Grim Reaper...

508
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,150
What?

509
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,440
Just like the serial bombing case,

510
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,190
the Grim Reaper appeared again...

511
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,530
That's why, you might be right.

512
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,190
I might've been too hot-headed recently.

513
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,530
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,690
Sato...

515
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,150
If I'm going to be caught up
with such thoughts,

516
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,110
I might as well quit
being a police and marry you.

517
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,190
Just kidding!

518
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,400
Please don't say something so depressing.

519
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,320
What?

520
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,110
If a police officer
gives up on investigating a case,

521
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,780
and quit their job,
doesn't that mean they're defeated?

522
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,940
Takagi...

523
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,190
I don't want to see you defeated.

524
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,980
Because I love and yearn for

525
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,570
the police officer, Miwako Sato!

526
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,030
Y-You're right,

527
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,980
Wataru...

528
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,480
But...

529
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,440
That's a separate matter...

530
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,150
Y-You know, about...

531
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,110
Marrying me...

532
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,110
She's gone!

533
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,650
Get off.

534
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,320
What's your plan for bringing me here,

535
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,440
Amuro?

536
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,230
You already knew, eh?

537
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,400
I've heard about
the order to stop investigating

538
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,440
the foreigner immolation case
that took place in front of the MPD.

539
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,730
The ones who could do something like that
are either people with a big influence, or...

540
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,690
The Public Security Bureau.

541
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,900
This case is related to Detective Matsuda
who died in the line of duty,

542
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,980
and you were in the same year as him
back in the Police Academy.

543
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,110
That’s also when Detective Takagi
and Detective Sato

544
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,820
from CID 1 began investigating this case.

545
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,820
Once I consider that information,
the answer is clear.

546
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,440
You've already known so much
and purposely isolated yourself

547
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,230
to create the chance
for us to restrain you...

548
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,360
Who are you?

549
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,980
That's not important.
What kind of facility is this?

550
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,570
This is an underground shelter
that belongs to the PSB.

551
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,190
This special tempered glass separates us.

552
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,820
It even intercepts electromagnetic waves.

553
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,530
If a huge explosion was to occur here,
you could walk away unscathed,

554
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,690
and no one above would notice any difference.

555
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,190
That collar-like thing around your neck...

556
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,320
Yes, it's a bomb.

557
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,230
We have no idea if it's
a time bomb or controlled remotely.

558
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,030
No idea how to defuse it, either.

559
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,480
It's frustrating,
but we don't know what to do.

560
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,320
I know the detectives from
Division 1 are searching for me.

561
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,320
But I can't possibly meet them
in this state, can I?

562
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,570
Also...

563
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,610
If they find out your identity, your
undercover investigation would go to waste.

564
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,150
I'll have to quit working
part-time at Café Poirot, too.

565
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,280
And that's why you brought me here.

566
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,360
I'll tell you about everything I know.

567
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,190
Please help the detectives
with their investigation.

568
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,190
So, on November 6 three years ago,

569
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,900
you met Detective Matsuda?

570
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,900
Yes, I did.

571
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,610
It'd been a long time since
the four of us met.

572
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,900
(Three Years Ago)

573
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,230
Hey...

574
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,820
You're late.

575
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,650
I thought you weren't coming, Matsuda.

576
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,030
Sorry.

577
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,690
One case after another
Couldn't find a chance to leave.

578
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,820
You moved to Division 1, right?

579
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,400
How do you find it?

580
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,230
Well, it is okay.

581
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,690
I'll be working at the MPD
starting next month.

582
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,570
Don't fail at your job
and get chased out, Senior!

583
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,690
Idiot, you were a detective before me.

584
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,610
Hagiwara would be happy to see you.

585
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,400
There's no way I'm not coming.

586
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,440
My promise to avenge him…

587
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,360
hasn't been realized yet.

588
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,780
To think something like that
happened the next day...

589
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,110
That's not the end of it, right?

590
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,110
Didn't something happen after that?

591
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,190
Something related to the explosion case.

592
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,070
Why do you think so?

593
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,730
I did a little research.

594
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,780
The grave is in a temple near Shibuya.

595
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,650
On that day three years ago, there was
a gas leak at a multipurpose building.

596
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,980
Exactly like what you've deduced.

597
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,650
That day...

598
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,780
Drop me off at Shibuya Station.

599
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,570
I'll head home by myself.

600
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,320
Sorry, but I can only drop you off
near the station.

601
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,440
I almost forgot. Just like Morofushi,

602
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,860
you can't attract attention.

603
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,360
Mr. Police, seems like it's time to work.

604
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,820
Sheesh, what a day!

605
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,030
Matsuda and I went there and were told that

606
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,070
someone snuck into the abandoned building

607
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,070
and was going on a rampage.

608
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,480
I asked for help from the others
who were with us at the temple.

609
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,360
Before they arrived at the scene,

610
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,780
Matsuda and I went in first
to check the situation.

611
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,570
Looks like he's unconscious.

612
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,780
Doesn't look Japanese.

613
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,230
Are you alright?

614
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,110
Calm down.

615
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,440
We're the police.

616
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,820
Police.

617
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,230
Po-li-ce.

618
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,440
Can you understand?

619
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,940
Run!

620
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,650
Hmm?

621
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
That's Russian, he's telling us to run.

622
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Go on ahead.

623
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,480
If the police stops you,
show them this name card.

624
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,940
Go on ahead.

625
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,690
If the police stops you,
show them this name card.

626
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,400
Seems like we have another guest here.

627
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,070
I'm outta here!

628
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,730
You're well-prepared.
As expected of a Public Security Officer.

629
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,320
Don't move!

630
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,860
This is bad...

631
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,110
What?

632
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,820
There's a bomb behind him.

633
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,110
If we accidentally hit it,
it might go 'boom'.

634
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,820
Looking at its size,

635
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,610
if it explodes,
everyone in this building will die.

636
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,320
Can you defuse it?

637
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,070
You think I can't?

638
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,280
I'll leave it to you.

639
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,480
Hold on!

640
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,690
I'll go after him.

641
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,360
Matsuda, hurry and defuse the bomb!

642
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,900
Yeah.

643
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,480
I'll leave them to you, too.

644
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,280
They went downstairs...

645
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,530
Damn! They're going after Matsuda!

646
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,440
Damn it.

647
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:43,570
Don't disrupt my fun bomb-defusing time!

648
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,730
Leader!

649
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,230
Don't taunt the guy with gun in his hand!

650
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,320
Hiro!

651
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,400
Is Zero alright?

652
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,070
Thank you, you saved us!

653
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,820
It was a great idea to take
the car door that he broke.

654
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,610
Wait!

655
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,030
Darn!

656
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,610
Both of you, move aside!

657
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,110
I won't let you escape.

658
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,900
Leader!

659
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,940
Please!

660
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,280
Are you serious?!

661
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,780
That's so reckless...

662
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Hiro! Leader!

663
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,980
Their accomplice
might still be hiding somewhere.

664
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,230
I'll leave Matsuda to you!

665
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,320
O-Okay.

666
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,900
Be careful!

667
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,570
Yeah!

668
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,610
Leader, I'll cover Zero.

669
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,480
They're not an ordinary person.

670
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,570
It might be tough to face him alone.

671
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,820
Yeah, I'll leave it to you!

672
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,650
Yeah.

673
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,780
A grenade!

674
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,280
He's still trying to escape?

675
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,530
He might still have an accomplice.

676
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,570
There's none.

677
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,190
Hmm?

678
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,860
If there were any,
he wouldn't have returned to kill me.

679
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,400
Y-Yeah, you're right.

680
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,860
Leader, do you have chewing gum?

681
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,610
Chewing helps me concentrate.

682
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,940
Every single one of you...

683
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,570
I'm no longer the squad leader.

684
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,480
Zero, are you hurt?

685
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,940
H-Hiro...

686
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,650
Darn!

687
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,730
Hiro, wait!

688
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,650
He's wounded, leave it to the reinforcements.

689
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,440
Zero, are you alright?

690
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,570
Yeah. You saved me, Hiro.

691
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,400
Shaking or tilting it ever so slightly,

692
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,190
and the liquid would flow out,
causing an explosion.

693
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,650
I'm sorry, he escaped.

694
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,440
Woah! Are you alright, Zero?

695
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,480
Nothing to worry about.

696
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,610
How is it going?

697
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,730
The situation here isn't great, either.

698
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
Leave this to me
and go evacuate the civilians nearby.

699
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,690
B-But...

700
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,690
Just go. There's only three minutes left.

701
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,730
Make up some excuse, just say that
there's a gas leak and evacuate people.

702
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,400
Understood.

703
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,400
Let's go, Hiro.

704
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,730
Leader, you, too.

705
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,650
Fine.

706
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,980
Matsuda...

707
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,820
We will be

708
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,610
waiting for you outside.

709
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,190
I can't make the promise.

710
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,730
Get away from here, now!

711
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,730
That was close...

712
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,190
Wha--

713
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,110
Remotely triggered? Darn!

714
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,860
What would Hagi do in this situation?

715
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,980
If I were him...

716
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,190
Jinpei!

717
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,940
Phone!

718
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,860
That was terrifying.

719
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,230
Thank you, Hagi.

720
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,280
I suddenly recalled what you once did.

721
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,190
I did exactly what you did, and it went well.

722
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,190
Was that to thank me for visiting your grave?

723
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,360
And that's what happened on the last day,
with four of us as a team.

724
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,780
In other words, the victim
was the same person from back then...

725
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,320
There's no doubt.

726
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,780
But I don't know who that man was.

727
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,360
That incident
wasn't reported anywhere, right?

728
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,190
It was announced as a gas leak incident.

729
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,070
Public Security intervened and
all info was sealed off by the upper level.

730
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,650
What happened to the bomb?

731
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,320
(Warehouse Explosion)
Is this...

732
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,110
(5 Workers Found Dead)
The bomb was brought to a shelter for analysis.

733
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,860
However, before we could
analyze its components,

734
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,280
there was a mysterious explosion,

735
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,940
and all related parties died.

736
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,230
You might need this for investigation.

737
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,190
This is Kazami's contact info,
although it can only be used this time.

738
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,070
Let me send you a photo and structure
of the bomb Matsuda disassembled,

739
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,150
plus a photo with my four colleagues.

740
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,690
From the left, that's Morofushi, Matsuda, Date,

741
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,360
with me in between, and Hagiwara.

742
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,360
Hmm?

743
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,190
Where have I seen him before?

744
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,070
It's time we say goodbye.

745
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,150
The enemy seems more dangerous
and tougher than I thought.

746
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,030
I had to let you know that.

747
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,730
As you see, I am not
in a situation to be moving around.

748
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,530
All the best.

749
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,690
(Shibuya - Hikarie)

750
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,900
Whoa! Amazing!

751
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,400
When we were here before,

752
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,230
the weather was bad,
so we didn't get a clear view.

753
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,980
Ah, over there!

754
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,730
I see a store selling something delicious!

755
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,940
Where is it?

756
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,110
Sorry for all the noise...

757
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,940
It's nice to be lively.

758
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,690
Anyway, how is Detective Mouri doing?

759
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,730
He's regained consciousness
and was transferred to a hospital nearby.

760
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,070
(Shibuya Central Hospital)
O-Ouch!

761
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,190
Do something!

762
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,730
This is strange.

763
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,400
The anesthetic should be working.

764
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,230
Does he have tolerance to anesthetic?

765
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,860
His painkiller wore off
and he was making a fuss like a child.

766
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,690
Look at that!

767
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,480
The helicopter is so close!

768
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,190
There's a heliport on
the rooftop of this building, the Hikarie.

769
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,320
We plan to go around Tokyo
in a helicopter after the wedding.

770
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,440
That's lovely!

771
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,730
How romantic!

772
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,980
Excuse me.

773
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,530
Yes, what is it?

774
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,900
Yes.

775
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,030
What?

776
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,440
Uhm, after this, I have a meeting...

777
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,110
Hello?

778
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,480
Hello?

779
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,860
What happened?

780
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,980
A friend has something she has to give me,
and since she's in Shibuya,

781
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,070
she wants me to come over.

782
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,110
That's a problem.

783
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,480
We have a meeting
with the emcee after this...

784
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,730
I told her that...

785
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,320
Shall we make the trip for you?

786
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,190
Eh?

787
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,820
It's nearby, right?

788
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,190
But...

789
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,690
Leave it to us!

790
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,070
Don't underestimate us
just because we're kids!

791
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,190
We accept any request!

792
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,320
We're the best first-graders!

793
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Here come the Junior Detectives!

794
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,230
When did it become 'the best’?

795
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,150
In that case, can I leave this to you?

796
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,530
I just received the map via text,
so let me draw it out for you.

797
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,940
Okay!

798
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,070
Sorry for the hassle.

799
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,030
Will you kids be alright?

800
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,440
I'd love to come along with you
but I need to go back to the hospital.

801
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,280
This is a piece of cake!

802
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,780
Here, this is the map.

803
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,440
Thank you very much!

804
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,570
Conan, you too...

805
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,110
Where are you going?

806
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,820
Conan? Ai?

807
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,360
This is the place.

808
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,570
T-This is different
from what I've imagined...

809
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,360
But it can't be wrong.

810
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,190
It's here, on the sixth floor...

811
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,440
Let's just go.

812
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,360
Okay...

813
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,940
It's here…

814
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,690
Excuse me...

815
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,440
We are here on behalf of Ms. Christine
to receive the present...

816
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,570
Is anyone here?

817
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,730
There's no sign of anyone...

818
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,650
The present is covered by a piece of cloth...

819
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,400
Could that be the present?

820
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,650
It's huge...

821
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,940
I’ll go.

822
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,030
All of you, wait here.

823
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,030
Be careful...

824
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,360
That's the present?

825
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,110
What's that?

826
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,030
This is...

827
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,480
It's a bomb!! Get away, quick!

828
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,360
The door closed on its own?!

829
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,440
We've been had!

830
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,530
It's a trap!

831
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,150
Less than two minutes until it explodes!

832
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,900
I'll find a way,
you guys get out of here first!

833
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,070
B-But...

834
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,280
Just go, quick!

835
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,030
Let's go.

836
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,730
A-Are we going to leave Conan behind?!

837
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,440
Right now, we can only trust Edogawa.

838
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,610
Hurry up!

839
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,690
There isn't much time!

840
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,690
Darn!

841
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,150
Conan, you have to get out safely!

842
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,980
Yeah!

843
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,570
I can possibly go down this pipe and...

844
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,530
This bomb's structure is almost identical.

845
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Would this work...?

846
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,650
What's going on here?!

847
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,610
Edogawa...

848
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:34,730
What?!

849
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,780
Something fell.

850
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,900
What's this?

851
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,610
Everyone!

852
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,940
Lend me hand!

853
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:44,980
Conan!

854
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,360
What's going on?!

855
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,480
A kettle?

856
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:48,480
Give me that!

857
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:48,940
What?

858
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,650
He needs the cloth!

859
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,730
I see, that's what he meant!

860
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,690
Edogawa!

861
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,320
Come as low as possible!

862
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,940
We can't help if you fall from that height!

863
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,110
Yeah!

864
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,940
Hurry up!

865
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,690
It's going to explode soon!

866
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,360
Faster!

867
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,440
I know!

868
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,230
Quick!

869
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,940
Conan!

870
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,110
Don't take your sweet time!

871
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,900
Idiot!

872
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,280
Edogawa!

873
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,190
It's hot!

874
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,570
Conan!

875
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,190
Here!

876
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,280
Wait! This way!

877
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,400
Ouch!

878
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,980
Are you alright?

879
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:47,780
Yea, I'm fine.

880
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,230
Thank you.

881
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,440
Let's get away, quick!

882
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,150
Y-Yes!

883
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,650
That was dangerous!

884
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,900
That was so close!

885
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,070
I'm so glad you're alright, Conan!

886
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,280
Conan! Everyone!

887
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,150
Big Sis Ran!

888
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,150
Are you injured?

889
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,280
Is everyone fine?

890
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,480
Yes, somehow.

891
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,190
Is it true that there was a bomb?!

892
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,900
Yeah!

893
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,780
I saw it with my own eyes!

894
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,150
It was glowing creepily, it was scary!

895
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,230
- And the cloth...
- Conan was locked in the room...

896
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,730
Wait, don’t speak at the same time.

897
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,730
I'll ask you one by one...

898
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,780
Can you analyze the content of the kettle
and the liquid on my jacket?

899
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,940
(Shibuya Central Police Station)
Thank goodness you're all fine.

900
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,740
When I heard that the building that caught
fire is the one you were heading to,

901
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,900
I turned pale.

902
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,110
It was terrifying, but I climbed down
using the drainage pipe.

903
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,780
Wow, that's impressive.

904
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,280
You're more courageous than me.

905
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,150
Ms. Christine, we are all safe now.

906
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,940
Please don't blame yourself.

907
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,690
Thank you...

908
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,690
According to Conan,

909
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,780
the time bomb was suddenly triggered
and the room's door was shut close.

910
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,530
Seems like they wanted to be sure
they got rid of whoever that went in.

911
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,730
That's why I want to ask,
who contacted Ms. Christine?

912
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,690
I tried to check, but my friend said

913
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,030
that she doesn't remember
making such a call...

914
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,650
I'll go search
the surrounding area for witnesses.

915
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,570
Someone could have witnessed
the person who planted the bomb there.

916
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,650
You don't have to.

917
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,320
Chiba is already on it.

918
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,190
It happened in Shibuya,

919
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,650
but not many people pass by this area...

920
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,070
I guess there's little hope
of finding a witness.

921
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,730
Hey, is everything alright?

922
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,360
Wha--

923
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,280
What are you doing?!

924
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,440
Ah, I see...

925
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,860
Let me know once you find out more.

926
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:21,730
Megure.

927
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,730
I'm sorry, but can we leave now?

928
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,900
She's quite stressed out.

929
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,730
I'm sorry about that.

930
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,820
You are allowed to leave.

931
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,030
Okay...

932
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,110
The bomb planted there...

933
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,860
It's quite similar to the bomb

934
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,570
Amuro and his friends
defused three years ago.

935
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,280
It's said that a bomb
reflects the personality of its maker.

936
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,230
Thank you for your time.

937
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,070
So it's very likely that the same culprit
is responsible for both cases...

938
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,070
She might need psychological support...

939
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,110
Indeed...

940
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,570
It's Chiba.

941
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,820
Hello?

942
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,570
I'll say it once more.

943
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,650
We have taken Detective Chiba.

944
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,940
If you want him back unscathed,

945
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,030
bring Detective Jinpei Matsuda here.

946
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,190
Detective Matsuda?!

947
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,650
What are you after?

948
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,360
Is Chiba safe?!

949
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,280
We'll contact you again.

950
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,320
They told us to bring Matsuda, but...

951
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,730
What are they after?

952
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,860
Why are they asking for Matsuda now?

953
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,070
(Bombing at the giant ferris wheel in Taito Mall)
In that bombing incident,

954
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,860
(One police officer killed dismantling the bomb.)
a police officer was reported to have died in the line of duty,

955
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,860
but Detective Matsuda's name
was not made public...

956
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,730
Instead, if they find out he's passed away...

957
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,820
What should we do?

958
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,440
If this goes on, Chiba's life is in danger...

959
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,650
Um...

960
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,980
I have an idea...

961
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,610
I definitely did not foresee
an officer from Division 1 to be abducted.

962
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,440
This was taken by that young boy, Conan.

963
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,650
Judging from this, it's extremely similar
to the bomb from three years ago.

964
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,860
So it's the same culprit...

965
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,610
Have you received information on that person?

966
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,610
The upper level reluctantly budged.

967
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,030
I just received it.

968
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,190
What about the liquid explosive
that Conan collected?

969
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,900
We're analyzing it right now.

970
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,320
Once complete, we'll produce the neutralizer.

971
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,110
He risked his life to collect those samples.

972
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,070
We cannot let it go to waste.

973
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,190
What should we do next?

974
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,820
Assist Division 1 in rescuing
the abducted officer.

975
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,940
You may reveal all
the information we possess.

976
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,320
Understood.

977
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,280
In the meantime,
we've done everything we could.

978
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,570
So...

979
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,320
What is your next move?

980
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,230
Seriously?!

981
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,570
That's too risky!

982
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,070
We are aware of the risks.

983
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,820
But there'll be a hidden mic
and a transmitter attached.

984
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,820
If anything happens,
we'll be there immediately--

985
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,610
What if we can't make it there in time?!

986
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,030
If the same thing as
three years ago happens--

987
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,070
Sato!

988
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,610
It'll be fine.

989
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,650
I seem to have the devil's luck.

990
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,230
The only person who can save Chiba right now…

991
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,150
is none other than me.

992
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,190
Kazami from Public Security Bureau
just offered to assist this investigation.

993
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,780
From now on, we'll work together with PSB.

994
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,610
We'll rescue Chiba by any means necessary!

995
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,730
Yes, let's go!

996
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,900
I definitely won’t let you die.

997
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,110
Hey, Detective Sato…

998
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,570
Is this evidence from the bombing incident

999
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,360
in front of the MPD?

1000
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,280
Yes, it is.

1001
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,690
Apparently, they found it in the shrubbery.

1002
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,860
Seems like it's some kind of note.

1003
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,940
He said, "It's a really important note.
I need to give it to someone."

1004
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,230
This is...

1005
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,150
The message that he wanted
to show Detective Matsuda?

1006
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:50,280
I made the call,
Detective Matsuda will be here soon.

1007
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,980
Are you sure this is going to work out?

1008
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,650
We have no other way to draw Plamya out.

1009
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,780
If they refuse, this man is finished.

1010
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,320
We'd like to avoid that.

1011
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,860
(Shibuya Central Police Station)
So, what's the point

1012
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,760
(Underground Public Security Conference Room)
of gathering all of us here?

1013
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,730
Sharing information.

1014
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:09,230
Oh? You're going to let us
meet that Furuya person?

1015
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,730
I can't do that.

1016
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,110
He's being quarantined
at a separate facility,

1017
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,860
as he has a bomb attached to his neck.

1018
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:26,030
A few days ago, the serial bomber that
you've caught escaped using some trick.

1019
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,690
When Furuya was going after that man,

1020
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,360
he was assaulted by somebody and got a
choker-shaped bomb around his neck.

1021
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,780
Then, what about the man who escaped?

1022
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,710
A bomb, the same model
that was later attached to Furuya,

1023
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,360
was detonated and killed him.

1024
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,360
It can't be...

1025
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,150
We believe this series of action was a trap

1026
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,360
to lure Furuya out.

1027
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,070
After analyzing it,

1028
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,780
we found out that
the choker-shaped bomb uses

1029
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,440
two types of liquid
that detonate when mixed.

1030
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,440
It's the same type of bomb used
in the incident three years ago.

1031
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,110
Hmm... Then, who is he indeed?

1032
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,280
You guys stopped him, right?

1033
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,730
An assassin, real identity unknown.

1034
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,030
Nationality, gender, and age, are all unknown.

1035
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,730
They work all over the world,
but is based in Russia.

1036
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,070
Also known and feared as 'Plamya'.

1037
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,780
Hey, in Russian, 'Plamya' means fire, right?

1038
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,900
What is it like when the explosives detonate?

1039
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,650
Did you bring this young boy here?

1040
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,070
He witnessed the strange bomb explode twice,

1041
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,150
I thought it'd
speed things up if he was here.

1042
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,610
So, what's the bomb like?

1043
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,030
It has both strong combustibility
and explosiveness.

1044
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,280
The instant the liquids come into contact,
it explodes, and the flame spreads.

1045
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,780
That's similar to what we saw
happen to the foreigner.

1046
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,730
The one killed in front of the MPD?

1047
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,570
Yes.

1048
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,360
Why go through the hassle
to do it in front of the MPD?

1049
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,980
And the reason why the victim visited
the MPD remains a mystery.

1050
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,110
The hint lies in the name card, doesn't it?

1051
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,360
Matsuda?

1052
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,110
The foreigner came to meet
Detective Matsuda, didn't he?

1053
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:08,320
Even if there was a risk, he still
needed Detective Matsuda's cooperation.

1054
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,860
In other words...

1055
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,570
The victim and
the culprit who kidnapped Chiba...

1056
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,400
Are related to one another?

1057
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:16,230
Mmhm.

1058
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,650
Regarding the explosion
at the multipurpose building today,

1059
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,820
there is a high possibility
that Plamya's special bomb was used.

1060
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,820
Conan and the Junior Detectives showing up
was beyond Plamya's expectations.

1061
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,440
The real target was Muranaka and his wife…

1062
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,650
Muranaka received a threat for his wedding.

1063
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,610
Plamya's targets are
definitely Muranaka and his wife...

1064
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,820
However...

1065
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,780
The relationship between the
foreigner immolation case

1066
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,400
and Chiba's kidnapping is still unknown.

1067
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,150
Also, since Plamya had information
regarding the person named Furuya,

1068
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,070
I think he must have known about
Detective Matsuda dying in the line of duty.

1069
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,570
Hey, among Furuya's classmates
at Police Academy,

1070
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,360
four have died, right?

1071
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,150
Detective Matsuda and Hagiwara
from the Explosive Disposal Unit,

1072
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,820
while defusing bombs.

1073
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,860
Detective Date, in a traffic accident.

1074
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,190
What about Morofushi?

1075
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,610
Morofushi?

1076
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,650
I'm sorry, but that is top secret.

1077
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,820
As usual, you're secretive.

1078
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,230
I can say this much.

1079
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,610
It has nothing to do with this case.

1080
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,070
Are you asking us to believe you?

1081
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,400
Well, hold on.

1082
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,860
Our priority now is to save Chiba.

1083
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,280
Takagi, get the disposal technique of
this bomb drilled into your head right now.

1084
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,900
You've analyzed it, right?

1085
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,610
I'll prepare the material right away.

1086
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,440
R-Roger that.

1087
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,730
...That's what I want to say.

1088
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,860
I'm actually not good with science
and engineering, not to mention, I'm clumsy.

1089
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,860
Even so, you wanted to disguise as Matsuda...

1090
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:49,360
Hmm, what was Matsuda like in person?

1091
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,610
Wild but unexpectedly kind,

1092
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,900
like a shiba-inu and a doberman
added together and divided by two?

1093
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,070
Okay?

1094
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,730
Hello?

1095
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,150
Get Matsuda on the phone.

1096
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,980
Before we do that, how about
you let us hear Chiba's voice?

1097
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,820
Get Matsuda on the phone first.

1098
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,440
If this drags on, you will never hear
this detective's voice again.

1099
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,860
Hello?

1100
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,610
You will do as I say.

1101
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,900
Head towards the entrance of Miyashita Park.

1102
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,690
I will call you again.

1103
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,230
Let's go.

1104
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,570
Your identities might be exposed.

1105
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,820
Use investigators from the PSB for tailing.

1106
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,570
Other than Sergeant Takagi,

1107
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,780
you can confirm the situation
through monitors, away from the scene.

1108
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,690
(Miyashita Park)
Please!

1109
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,110
Please!

1110
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,690
(Currently Under Preparation)
How is it?

1111
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,400
Is there anyone suspicious?

1112
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,820
No.

1113
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,280
Nothing at the moment.

1114
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,650
Don't let your guard down.

1115
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,360
We don't know what they're like,
or how many there are.

1116
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,980
Roger that.

1117
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,650
Trick or treat!

1118
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,780
Trick or treat!

1119
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,730
Trick or treat!

1120
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,400
Trick or treat!

1121
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,820
Trick or treat!

1122
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,940
Trick or treat!

1123
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,980
What's that?

1124
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,610
A Halloween event?

1125
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,030
Trick or treat!

1126
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,440
Wow!

1127
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,360
Candies!

1128
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,480
Give me some!

1129
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,610
Ah, that's a new product!

1130
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,780
Can we get these for free?!

1131
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,610
A Halloween event?!

1132
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:35,440
We didn't hear about it!

1133
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,530
Hurry and stop them!

1134
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,360
Lots of candies!

1135
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,650
Great!

1136
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,230
Yummy!

1137
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,610
What are you doing!?

1138
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,480
Hurry and go after them!

1139
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,480
But...

1140
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,980
There are too many people...

1141
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,780
Hurry! Don't lose them!

1142
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:58,730
Hold on!

1143
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,400
So, you were told to help out
as part-time workers?

1144
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,030
Yes, we were asked to help out for a bit,
and we got some money...

1145
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,400
Assistant Police Inspector Sato,

1146
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,650
look at this.

1147
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,360
This was what
Police Sergeant Takagi had on him.

1148
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,070
I will bring the police dogs over
and track his scent.

1149
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,610
Is that alright?

1150
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,480
Yes.

1151
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,610
An underground water storage tank...

1152
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,440
Remove your mask.

1153
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,650
My...

1154
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,400
What a strange Halloween.

1155
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,940
Shiba Inu and Doberman, Shiba Inu and Doberman!

1156
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,400
Detective Matsuda, right?

1157
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,360
Let me confirm Chiba's safety...

1158
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,440
Come over here.

1159
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,610
He was put to sleep
with some type of anesthesia or drugs...

1160
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,980
I get it, I get it.

1161
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,070
Well, let’s hear it,

1162
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,230
the reason you brought me here like this…

1163
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:48,150
It's my fault for being rough.

1164
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:49,400
I apologize.

1165
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,360
You say that after kidnapping a cop?

1166
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,360
Detective Matsuda, I won't ask
for your understanding.

1167
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,400
However, this is the only option
we are left with.

1168
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,440
Hey, what are you doing?

1169
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:04,610
Erenka!

1170
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,530
My name is Erenka Lavrentieva.

1171
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,030
(Erenka Lavrentieva)
I came here to Japan, following Plamya.

1172
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,110
Erenka, what are you trying to do?!

1173
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,230
Revealing your face and name...

1174
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,690
I'm doing this to catch that person
with these hands.

1175
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,650
I see.

1176
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,400
If you're going to such an extent,

1177
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,570
I'll listen to what you have to say.

1178
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,030
It's difficult.

1179
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,110
The scent of the candies
is distracting the dogs...

1180
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,650
We need to go after them
as quickly as possible...

1181
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,190
Hello?

1182
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,360
We know where they are!

1183
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,780
It's the underground water storage tank!

1184
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,650
What?!

1185
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,530
We don't know what the source is,

1186
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,360
but a footage started appearing
on the surveillance monitor!

1187
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,190
Plamya is a fearsome terrorist
who uses special liquid explosives.

1188
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,280
Countless lives were ended by his hands.

1189
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,360
My family, too, was killed by him.

1190
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:05,280
Everyone here has lost their family
or loved ones to those detestable bombs.

1191
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,650
We are all comrades who will fight together,

1192
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,230
swearing vengeance against Plamya.

1193
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,400
Alright.

1194
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,530
(Grigory Lazarev)

1195
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,730
Us, too.

1196
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,480
We're going after Plamya on our own.

1197
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,780
I see.\

1198
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,900
So they're a group of civilians.

1199
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,030
- That's why they have limited information
- Prepare paper and pen.

1200
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,400
and didn't know about Detective Matsuda
dying in the line of duty.

1201
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,360
I understand your situation now.

1202
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,360
So, what do you need me for?

1203
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,820
Please give us information
about Plamya's bomb.

1204
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:50,480
Three years ago, you defused the bomb
that was planted in a building.

1205
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:54,230
We would like you to tell us more
about the bomb's structure.

1206
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,400
I see.

1207
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,110
(Dmitry Lazarev)
If we can understand the characteristics of the bomb,

1208
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,610
we can foresee where
it may be planted.

1209
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,280
We might have a chance
to capture him that way.

1210
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,650
Do you have no intention
in cooperating with the police?

1211
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:09,900
We can't trust the police!

1212
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,230
That foreigner who died
in front of the MPD...

1213
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,530
Was he one of your comrades?

1214
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,150
(Oleg Lavrentiev)
He was my older brother, Oleg.

1215
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,150
There's one thing we know about Plamya.

1216
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,730
He'll always destroy
evidence from his hideout

1217
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,360
by burning it before carrying out
his bombing attacks.

1218
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,820
A few months ago,

1219
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:32,690
my brother found the hideout

1220
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,570
and went there alone.

1221
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:41,190
He successfully stole a tablet.

1222
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,190
And in it...

1223
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,280
There was something
that looked like a bomb blueprint,

1224
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,860
along with something related to Tokyo.

1225
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,030
But the screen turned off within seconds.

1226
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,940
There was nothing
he could do to switch it on again.

1227
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,440
Then he said, "It'll be faster to ask someone
in Tokyo about matters in Tokyo",

1228
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,780
and headed to the MPD.

1229
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,360
And that's why the tablet
was slightly burned...

1230
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,070
But the bomb that killed him
was planted in the tablet.

1231
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,610
So Plamya had foreseen that the tablet
would be taken away, and set up a trap.

1232
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,980
I understand the situation now.

1233
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:20,280
But your brother was also
at the scene three years ago.

1234
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,940
What was that about?

1235
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,730
That was a plan we devised.

1236
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,530
We hired Plamya to bomb that building,

1237
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,480
and we planned to capture him there.

1238
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,110
But the plan failed, and he escaped.

1239
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,030
So we were made to bear
the consequences of your failure.

1240
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,860
My brother said the same thing.

1241
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,860
He said he wanted to
meet Detective Matsuda again.

1242
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:46,530
'We weren't able to defuse
Plamya's bomb, but he was.'

1243
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,440
That's why we researched about you,

1244
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,570
getting an old picture of you
along with very little information.

1245
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,940
And we also called you here.

1246
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,780
Well, I'm honored.

1247
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,820
My family, the people more important
than my own life, was murdered.

1248
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:03,610
I will do anything.

1249
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,110
This conversation ends here.

1250
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,650
Draw it out for us, now.

1251
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,570
I don't want to.

1252
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,730
I can't play along
with your personal vengeance.

1253
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,730
Damn you!

1254
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,110
This is why I was against this!

1255
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,480
We don't need help from such a jerk!

1256
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,730
Detective Matsuda, you don't have a choice.

1257
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,190
Do you not care if anything
happens to Detective Chiba?

1258
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,360
This matter is too tough for you to handle.

1259
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,280
We'll arrest him and have him punished...

1260
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,190
So just leave it to the police!

1261
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,610
Eh?

1262
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,110
Matsuda!?

1263
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,940
No way! Have I died?!

1264
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:42,940
Dead?

1265
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,780
B-Because Matsuda has already died...

1266
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,820
Chiba, you idiot!

1267
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:50,940
Damn you!

1268
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,480
You thought you could deceive us!

1269
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,400
Police!

1270
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,820
Everyone, do not move!

1271
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,400
Darn! I thought we've
warded off the people tailing us...

1272
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:02,900
How about you stop right there?

1273
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,280
Plamya will be the one who benefits the most
if we fight among ourselves.

1274
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,070
Conan?!

1275
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,530
Did you get the video, too?!

1276
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,230
Kid, do you wish to die!?

1277
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,860
Hold on! Don't shoot the child!

1278
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,230
The situation is unfavorable. Let's retreat.

1279
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,230
Darn it!

1280
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,610
Don't come closer!

1281
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,940
This isn't a place for a child.

1282
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,030
We will stop it!

1283
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,900
We will extinguish Plamya!

1284
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:30,730
Damn!

1285
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,480
Hurry up and prepare the lights!

1286
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:34,690
Don't let them run!

1287
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,070
Up, they went up!

1288
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:37,150
Go after them!

1289
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,070
Darn…

1290
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,690
I don't want you to end up like my son.

1291
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,320
Find the switch!

1292
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,400
Hurry!

1293
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,610
Is the hostage alright?

1294
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,320
Over here!

1295
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:57,780
Takagi!

1296
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,940
Are you alright?!

1297
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,320
Yes… Somehow.

1298
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,360
Until halfway through, I thought my acting
was worthy of the Macademy Awards.

1299
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,320
I messed up at the very end...

1300
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,980
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

1301
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,570
Are you alright?

1302
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,480
Thank you very much.

1303
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,440
I don’t want you to end up like my son.

1304
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:22,320
Son...

1305
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,980
I was so worried about you!

1306
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:35,030
Hey! N-Naeko, I am alright...

1307
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,360
I-I... I am sorry...

1308
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:44,150
So, what about the group that escaped?

1309
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,570
We went after them
as quickly as we could, but…

1310
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,900
Let's cancel the wedding ceremony.

1311
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,940
Everyone's safety comes first.

1312
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,730
But there’s no doubt that
Plamya is going after you.

1313
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,280
We will arrange police protection for you.

1314
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,030
I'll leave that to you.

1315
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,110
Dear! This came in a message!

1316
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:08,030
(Unknown Number)
Carry on with the wedding as planned.

1317
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,530
If you cancel it,

1318
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,190
there might be more victims...

1319
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,070
What?!

1320
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,530
So we're still proceeding
with the wedding, right?

1321
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,230
Yes... This is the only thing we can do.

1322
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,400
But,

1323
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,280
I won't let Plamya get his way.

1324
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,940
I will definitely arrest him.

1325
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,360
Why?

1326
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,110
Why is Plamya doing all this?

1327
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,230
Even if Mr. Muranaka's
wedding ceremony gets canceled,

1328
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,780
he could target them at other locations.

1329
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,360
Why is he so persistent about wedding?

1330
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,570
What's wrong, Conan?

1331
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,650
You have a scary expression.

1332
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,440
I-It's nothing!

1333
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,150
Ah, I've got a phone call.

1334
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,610
I'll be going home!

1335
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,320
Be careful on your way back!

1336
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,150
Yeah!

1337
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,530
I didn't think you'd contact me.

1338
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,360
I want to share this
with you as quickly as possible...

1339
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,860
I found some information
on the organization going after Plamya.

1340
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,860
The organization's name is
'Nado Unichtozhit'.

1341
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,070
They have a network
that spans from Russia to Europe,

1342
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,650
and they track Plamya on their own.

1343
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,780
Nado Unichtozhit.

1344
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,650
'Must be extinguished.'

1345
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,860
That means they plan to take Plamya's life...

1346
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:17,110
The leader is a woman
who goes by the name 'Erenka'.

1347
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,530
She has a burn scar on her face.

1348
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,360
Frustrated at the halfhearted effort
made by the police in various countries,

1349
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,030
she formed an organization
to seek vengeance against Plamya.

1350
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,940
Even though they're just
a group of civilians,

1351
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,570
they've proven to be
a tough opponent for Plamya.

1352
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,150
Following him around the world,
making his jobs fail.

1353
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:41,730
This might be related to
the bombing incidents in Japan.

1354
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,230
The foreigner immolation case and
the explosion in the multipurpose building.

1355
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,940
Something bothers me about
the bomb in that building.

1356
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,400
If I were in his place, I would've used a
remote control instead of timer.

1357
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,320
That would have been more reliable.

1358
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:57,280
And this time, they took the trouble
of contacting the police directly.

1359
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,440
Plamya should be after something specific...

1360
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:04,570
Also, we don't know why
they attached that collar bomb onto you.

1361
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:07,030
If they'd wanted revenge
for what happened three years ago,

1362
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,730
why didn't they kill you
right after luring you out?

1363
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,150
I've been thinking about that, too.

1364
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,690
Have you seen the note
from the immolation case?

1365
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,650
Yes.

1366
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,530
We have no idea what it means.

1367
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,860
There isn't much time until the wedding...

1368
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,360
My friend said this:

1369
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,820
'Impatience is the biggest trap of all.'

1370
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,480
Have you not overcome
countless crises like this before?

1371
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,780
I wish you all the best.

1372
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,190
I'm sorry for being late.

1373
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,610
Well, I'm starting to feel bored
from staying in here.

1374
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:45,110
I'll be relying on you, Kazami.

1375
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,360
And on the day of the wedding...

1376
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,150
Happy Halloween!

1377
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,440
(Shibuya Mark City)

1378
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,900
It's time. Plamya is bound
to appear in that building.

1379
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:15,070
We have to kill him no matter what.

1380
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,820
This might be our last chance, after all.

1381
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:21,690
That's why we, all members
of Nado Unichtozhit,

1382
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,570
have come here to Japan.

1383
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,980
In any case,

1384
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:28,030
if the bomb goes off,

1385
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,230
there will be many innocent victims.

1386
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,980
There's no way you can forget that, right?

1387
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,320
But it was too late then...

1388
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:44,190
Kirill!

1389
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,730
I wish I could've saved him, too.

1390
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,030
Even though you rushed in,
your son was already...

1391
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:53,610
Shut up.

1392
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,610
W-We're sorry, Erenka.

1393
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,030
We shouldn't have said that.

1394
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,570
Please return to your usual calm self.

1395
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,610
Are you alright? Dmitry!?

1396
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:09,860
Seems like it's become a big deal.

1397
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:10,940
Yeah.

1398
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,230
The wedding will be held with only
Mr. Muranaka and Ms. Christine.

1399
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,650
I see...

1400
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,900
It's such an important ceremony...

1401
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:20,070
It's such a pity.

1402
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,400
While we have a carefree one here...

1403
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:27,980
What is this note?

1404
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:28,980
Huh?

1405
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,190
When the bomb exploded
in front of the MPD,

1406
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,570
I remembered seeing a note
fall in front of me,

1407
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,400
so I tried drawing it.

1408
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,070
Big Sis Ran, you saw the note?

1409
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,570
I saw it, but only for a moment.

1410
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,900
It doesn't look like English,
so I don't understand what it means.

1411
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,900
I thought I'd ask Dad about it
when he wakes up.

1412
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,400
It wasn't the symbol for Japanese yen...

1413
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:50,530
This symbol... I've seen it somewhere...

1414
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:55,860
Conan?

1415
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,730
Muranaka received a threat.

1416
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:09,110
He said it's an important note
that he needs to give to someone...

1417
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,400
I met her at a hospital.

1418
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,440
When I was hospitalized
for an injured shoulder.

1419
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,070
It's a fateful encounter!

1420
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,610
Well, something like that.

1421
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:22,150
The child picked up something
that the victim had dropped,

1422
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,900
and just as she handed it over...

1423
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,690
A friend has something she has to give me...

1424
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:29,650
This is the message that
he wanted to show Detective Matsuda?

1425
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:33,780
Conan and the Junior Detectives showing up
was beyond Plamya’s expectations.

1426
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,730
The real target was Muranaka and…

1427
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,980
We are all comrades who will fight together,

1428
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,730
swearing vengeance against Plamya.

1429
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:43,230
Carry on with the wedding as planned.

1430
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,110
If you cancel it,

1431
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:49,570
there might be more victims...

1432
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,280
Here it is, this is where the answer lies...

1433
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,030
Conan!

1434
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,190
What's wrong?

1435
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,400
Look at this.

1436
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,530
This is the traffic restriction area
planned for Halloween.

1437
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,150
Isn't there a road that goes

1438
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,360
from the Y-shaped Dogenzaka Shita
to Miyamasuzaka Shita?

1439
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,190
Yes.

1440
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,780
Then it intersects Jingu-dori
before intersecting

1441
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,940
Meiji-dori Avenue that curves
around Shibuya Station.

1442
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,610
And if you rotate this map 90 degrees...

1443
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,690
It'll look like the symbol for yen.

1444
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:24,860
The piece of the note I saw
happened to have this line burned off,

1445
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,900
so I thought it's a symbol for yen.

1446
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:32,320
But Mr. Muranaka and Ms. Christine's wedding
would be held in Hikarie, in Shibuya.

1447
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:35,230
He doesn't have to go through
the hassle of drawing it...

1448
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,530
No, it's not just Hikarie.

1449
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,860
Perhaps, even this area surrounding it too...

1450
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,190
Conan, you're speaking just like Shinichi!

1451
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,650
And that was what Big Brother Shinichi said!

1452
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,400
You consulted Shinichi about the case again?

1453
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:52,570
Y-Yes.

1454
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,820
He said he's solved another mystery as well!

1455
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,030
The building explosion
that I was involved in

1456
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,400
actually wasn't an attack
targeted at Mr. Muranaka.

1457
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,730
What do you mean?

1458
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:06,360
We were the target all along.

1459
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,280
We were the ones
who might have seen this note,

1460
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,110
so the culprit wanted to eliminate us.

1461
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
Hold on.

1462
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,360
How would the culprit know
the children would be going to that building?

1463
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,570
It was a time bomb, right?

1464
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,150
I heard that it was planted ahead of time.

1465
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:26,190
Wasn't there a person
who made us head into the building?

1466
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,400
Could it be...

1467
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,900
The person who said there was
going to be a meeting with the emcee...

1468
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:34,820
The culprit changed their facial features
and was hiding in Japan.

1469
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,110
That's what
a Public Security officer told me.

1470
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,030
That's a problem.

1471
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:42,610
We have a meeting
with the emcee after this...

1472
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,150
So the culprit is Tsutomu Muranaka?

1473
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:53,440
It's possible to pass off as someone else if
they quit their job to live in retirement.

1474
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,480
But he was a former police officer!

1475
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:59,730
The child picked up something
the victim had dropped...

1476
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,190
Because I told them that...

1477
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:06,690
You didn't tell them the name
of the child back then,

1478
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:09,860
so he couldn't determine exactly
which child picked it up.

1479
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,280
Hence, the plan was to kill
everyone in the explosion.

1480
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,360
That's what Big Bro Shinichi told me.

1481
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,440
How horrible...

1482
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,230
And these words...

1483
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,610
These letters are not English.
They're Russian.

1484
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,190
This word above

1485
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,440
is probably "пуля", which means bullet.

1486
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,480
And what is this under it?

1487
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,070
The number 40...

1488
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,070
Big Sis Ran!

1489
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,110
I'll go inform the others about this!

1490
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,110
Wait!

1491
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:38,110
Does that mean Muranaka
sent the death threat himself?!

1492
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,070
What did Shinichi say?

1493
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,280
Conan!

1494
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:46,650
Are you alright?

1495
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:49,400
To be completely honest,

1496
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,820
I'm terrified.

1497
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:53,230
We will definitely protect you!

1498
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,320
Two people have been killed in Japan, right?

1499
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,070
The bomb planted in that building...

1500
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,150
It's alright.

1501
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:02,980
We won't let Plamya lay a finger on you.

1502
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,440
That was dangerous!

1503
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:16,570
Lots of people have gathered here at Shibuya!

1504
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:19,730
It's Halloween and we're here
at Professor's place?

1505
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,360
How boring...

1506
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:25,780
Ayumi wants to go to Shibuya, too.

1507
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,230
It can't be helped.

1508
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,730
We can't possibly go there ourselves.

1509
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:32,900
The adults are too busy
to be dealing with this.

1510
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,730
Let's behave ourselves.

1511
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:39,030
Ta-da! It's the Funny
Hallow-Hallow-Halloween Quiz!

1512
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,110
It's here…

1513
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,820
A metropolitan full of high-rise buildings.

1514
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,030
There are police officers
right in the middle of it,

1515
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,570
working hard to protect the night view.

1516
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,780
Which of the following is doing the job?

1517
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,860
Shinjuku Police.

1518
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,530
Shibuya Police.

1519
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,360
Shinagawa Police.

1520
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,530
Ikebukuro Police.

1521
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,780
We're not in the mood to solve quizzes.

1522
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,320
I'll get hungry if I use my brain.

1523
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,570
I really wanted to go Shibuya...

1524
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:09,730
Ayumi, that's correct!

1525
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,230
The answer is Shibuya Police.

1526
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,280
(Shi Bu "Ya Ke i")
In the middle,

1527
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,110
(Sa Tsu)
there are the three syllables for "night view" in the name!

1528
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:17,070
We don't really care.

1529
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,070
But I spent time thinking about it!

1530
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,320
Yes, what is it?

1531
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:23,400
What did you say?!

1532
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,530
No, but that's still…

1533
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,320
What's wrong, Professor?

1534
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:28,690
Who was that from?

1535
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,860
Hmm... Was it from Conan?

1536
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,570
N-No, it wasn't!

1537
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:34,610
But... How should I put it...

1538
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,780
(Please bring the new belt to Shibuya.)
Aren't you hiding something from us?

1539
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,730
Don't tell the children, it's dangerous.)

1540
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:03,760
(Shibuya Scramble Square)

1541
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:07,110
It's time, let's go.

1542
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,110
Wha--?!

1543
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,150
How did you find this place?

1544
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,690
When I hit the man behind you with the mask,

1545
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,730
I did a little something.

1546
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:20,780
So you...!

1547
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,190
Erenka, I have something to tell you.

1548
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,190
Cut it out! A kid like you...

1549
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:28,980
It's going to be dangerous here tonight.

1550
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,070
Please leave now.

1551
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,110
I know who Plamya is!

1552
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:34,780
You can speak Russian?!

1553
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:38,400
You may exchange your rings.

1554
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,360
Hey, what's wrong?

1555
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,650
Inspector, this is bad!

1556
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:54,570
The group of people under warrant
is holding a child as hostage…

1557
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,860
Damn!

1558
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,150
Plamya! Prepare yourself!

1559
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:00,440
Don't move!

1560
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:02,400
Or I'm going to blow this kid's head off.

1561
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,480
Conan!

1562
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,780
Drop your guns!

1563
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,480
What are you planning to do?

1564
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,730
I know Plamya's real identity!

1565
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:11,980
What did you say?!

1566
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,150
You two, move aside!

1567
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,070
The detective at the back,

1568
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,480
close the doors and lock it up.

1569
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,480
Raise your hands,

1570
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,400
Plamya!

1571
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,320
Wha...?!

1572
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:40,980
What are you talking about!?

1573
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,730
Plamya is targeting him!

1574
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,980
Don't move!

1575
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,230
You're the culprit?

1576
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:49,440
N-No!

1577
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,690
Why would I be threatening myself?

1578
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:52,940
Don't move!

1579
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,690
Both the groom and bride.

1580
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,400
Hurry up and raise your hands.

1581
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,730
What's wrong, bride?

1582
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,940
You, raise your hands, too.

1583
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,230
Hold on!

1584
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,150
Due to an injury from
a traffic accident three years ago,

1585
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,820
she can't raise her right shoulder!

1586
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:12,320
A traffic accident?

1587
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:16,820
Three years ago,
you were shot by a detective in Japan,

1588
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,570
so you can't raise
your right shoulder, right?

1589
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:19,780
Am I right,

1590
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,150
Christine Richard?

1591
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,780
No,

1592
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,530
Plamya!

1593
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,530
You're saying I'm the culprit?

1594
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:28,980
Cut it out!

1595
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,070
Why is she the culprit?

1596
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:32,940
This is...?

1597
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,190
A metal detector.

1598
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,820
There's a bullet embedded

1599
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,980
inside Plamya's shoulder.

1600
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,070
It should react if you
put it close to her shoulder.

1601
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:42,280
Hold on!

1602
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,610
There's a metal bolt
in my shoulder due to surgery...

1603
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,780
Speaking of which,

1604
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,690
when we were in the dressing room,

1605
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,780
you said Plamya killed
two people in Japan, didn't you?

1606
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:52,650
The murder of the serial bomber who escaped

1607
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:55,400
isn't officially announced, so...

1608
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:56,570
Why would you say "two people"?

1609
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:57,650
Even you?!

1610
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:02,190
Wasn’t our wedding
supposed to have flawless security?

1611
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,320
But those intruders walked in easily,

1612
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,320
and here we are, treated like criminals…

1613
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,530
This wedding is a mess!

1614
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,480
I'm sorry, Christine...

1615
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:13,780
It was supposed to be your special day...

1616
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:24,730
To think I am exposed at the very end...

1617
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:25,940
Christine?

1618
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,320
What are you…

1619
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,730
Shut up, shut up!

1620
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:35,320
C-Chris...

1621
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,820
Shut up! You're all like buzzing flies!

1622
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:49,280
Take cover!

1623
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,400
Everyone, hurry and take cover!

1624
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,190
Conan?!

1625
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,070
Quick!

1626
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,110
O-Okay!

1627
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,940
I won't let anyone

1628
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,820
who knows my real identity live!

1629
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,070
Stop it…

1630
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:09,480
Christine!

1631
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,360
Muranaka!

1632
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,280
Inspector Megure!

1633
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,280
Are you alright?!

1634
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,820
Quick, take cover!

1635
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,860
Are you okay?

1636
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,980
Yeah.

1637
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:25,110
What shall we do?

1638
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:27,860
Stall for time.

1639
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,940
I've got one more thing to do!

1640
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:31,030
Good luck!

1641
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,150
Alright.

1642
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,780
The bride is the culprit!

1643
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,110
She's on the second floor passage…

1644
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:40,320
Let's go through the other entrance!

1645
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,480
Muranaka, hang in there!

1646
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,320
I'm sorry, Megure.

1647
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,280
I'm really such a fool...

1648
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,320
Idiot!

1649
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,820
You've always been a fool!

1650
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,860
Why would you worry about that now?!

1651
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:55,440
You move your body before you think
just as your instinct tells you.

1652
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:57,110
You are the Demon Muranaka!

1653
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:59,070
Megure...

1654
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,070
Sato?!

1655
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:02,280
Sato!

1656
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,150
Watch out!

1657
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,480
Damn!

1658
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:15,070
Wait!

1659
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,360
Takagi, you're heavy!

1660
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,030
We're going after her!

1661
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,190
Y-Yes!

1662
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,860
She must be heading to the rooftop!

1663
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,190
Is she planning to escape using a helicopter?

1664
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,570
It's the helicopter they booked
as part of the wedding.

1665
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,230
- We have to hurry!
- The police is everywhere.

1666
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,070
What are we going to do?

1667
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,730
Don't touch the cops.

1668
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:32,030
I made a promise to the boy.

1669
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:35,730
He said he would bring Plamya to us.

1670
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,650
Let's believe in him.

1671
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,400
It's late...

1672
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:53,400
I think you should give up already,

1673
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,730
Christine.

1674
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:04,650
Well, I should just call you "Plamya", huh?

1675
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:07,280
Who are you?

1676
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:08,900
I'm Conan Edogawa,

1677
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,480
a detective.

1678
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,110
No way, it's shut.

1679
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:18,360
Detective?

1680
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,530
Your plan has failed.

1681
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:23,730
The plan to kill them all at once.

1682
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,110
Erenka and her comrades
in Nado Unichtozhit

1683
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,900
have been pursuing you around the world.

1684
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,940
Even someone like Plamya
would be driven to the corner.

1685
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:35,690
That's why you devised
a plan to start afresh.

1686
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,110
You planned to
gather all of them in one place,

1687
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,280
and blow them all up
with your signature bombs...

1688
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,980
As expected of someone
who calls himself a detective.

1689
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,320
Young boy, you're right.

1690
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,230
First, I spread rumors about my retirement.

1691
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,360
Then, I got close to Muranaka...

1692
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:58,780
And then you made up the story about
Muranaka being targeted by someone.

1693
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:00,820
If Plamya is involved,

1694
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:02,780
those people will come chasing.

1695
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:06,730
They would hurry and try to capture me,
thinking this would be their final chance.

1696
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:09,360
And you have one more goal in mind.

1697
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,320
To kill all witnesses.

1698
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,610
You have killed everyone aware
of your identity as Plamya.

1699
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:17,610
However…

1700
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:21,820
Yes, I've tasted humiliation in Japan before…

1701
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,860
Because of those four policemen!

1702
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,440
Your targets are from that time…

1703
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,530
Bingo.

1704
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,650
After digging deep into the MPD,

1705
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,940
I found out Matsuda has already died.

1706
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:36,070
Date died from a traffic accident.

1707
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:39,730
The only ones remaining are the two men
known as Zero and Hiro.

1708
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:43,030
I only know their names
as Furuya and Morofushi,

1709
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,650
but no matter how hard I searched,

1710
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:47,610
there was no more information on them...

1711
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,480
And that's when you used of the serial bomber
who killed Matsuda to lure them out.

1712
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:58,900
That's right, if I let him escape,
they would come out from hiding...

1713
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,360
Just as anticipated, Furuya showed himself,

1714
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,360
and I managed to plant a bomb on him!

1715
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,530
I thought that would definitely lure
the other one out.

1716
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,400
But after doing so much,

1717
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:11,440
he still hasn't shown himself,
and that could only mean...

1718
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:13,360
He's dead, isn't he?

1719
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,650
The tablet that Erenka's brother,
Oleg, was holding on to...

1720
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,400
That was a trap, right?

1721
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:20,690
Exactly.

1722
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:25,110
If he'd brought the stolen tablet
back to his comrades,

1723
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:28,780
I could blow up the Nado Unichtozhit.

1724
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:33,730
Instead, he acted independently
without joining up with his comrades.

1725
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:37,030
And planned to tell Matsuda everything.

1726
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,650
Though Matsuda is already dead...

1727
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:44,320
By watching his movement
from the GPS in the tablet,

1728
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,070
you triggered the bomb
before he could reach the MPD.

1729
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,860
With the keyword of 'Tokyo' in the tablet,

1730
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,320
those people in Nado Unichtozhit
took the bait I planted.

1731
01:26:56,730 --> 01:27:01,570
But for that man to find out about
the bullet in my shoulder...

1732
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,440
was a miscalculation on my part.

1733
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:06,440
We found out because of
the note left by Oleg.

1734
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:07,860
"Bullet" and "shoulder".

1735
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,980
Three years ago,
Plamya was also shot in the shoulder.

1736
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:13,690
They told me removing
the bullet would damage my nerve,

1737
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:16,150
and that would affect
the movement in my right arm...

1738
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:20,530
That's a lethal injury to your ability
to build intricate bombs!

1739
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,940
So you gave up removing the bullet.

1740
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,360
In return, you can't lift your
right arm anymore, and that's the truth.

1741
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,230
Where did you plant the bomb?

1742
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,440
What can you do about it at this point?

1743
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:38,230
Your identity has been exposed to the police,
Nado Unichtozhit, and many other people.

1744
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,900
Isn't it pointless to
carry out the explosion now?

1745
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:44,610
I believe I said this earlier.

1746
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:48,780
Anyone who knows my identity
shall not be allowed to live.

1747
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,610
All these clueless fools gathering here.

1748
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:56,570
I bet they thought those are just
Halloween decoration to liven up the mood.

1749
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,320
Could it be...?!

1750
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:00,230
Those lanterns?!

1751
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:06,190
I've planted dummies and liquid explosives
around Dogenzaka and Miyamasuzaka.

1752
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,570
The liquid will flow to the lowest point,

1753
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:12,280
or in other words, it would all
gather at the scramble crossing.

1754
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,070
I see.

1755
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:16,530
You're planning to use
the elevation difference in Shibuya...

1756
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:22,480
The massive amount of liquid explosives

1757
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:25,860
would create an unprecedentedly
huge explosion.

1758
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:34,320
And everyone who knows of my identity

1759
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,280
will disappear from this world!

1760
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,230
And that's what I wanted to hear.

1761
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,820
Damn, you are...

1762
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,230
Rei Furuya?!

1763
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,400
We could've captured you any time...

1764
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:03,820
But we had to let you get this far

1765
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,070
to find out the location of the bomb.

1766
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:09,940
Well, though it's partly foreseeable
from that drawn symbol.

1767
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,150
You damn brat...

1768
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:12,980
Plamya!

1769
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:14,440
You have no way to escape!

1770
01:29:21,070 --> 01:29:22,780
I guess this is the end for me.

1771
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,980
Put your hand up...

1772
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,730
And put it behind your head.

1773
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:29,400
Yea.

1774
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,530
Al... right!

1775
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,610
At this stage, I can only take out
as many of you as I can!

1776
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:42,980
Wha...!

1777
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,070
Go!

1778
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:56,610
It missed!

1779
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:57,650
Not yet!

1780
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,570
Hit it!!

1781
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:06,690
Fireworks ball!

1782
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:22,690
Darn!

1783
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:27,980
As a precaution, I have a spare ready.

1784
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:32,650
I'll send you to the other world first.

1785
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:34,400
With that collar bomb!

1786
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,690
What?!

1787
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,150
I thought this would happen,

1788
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,820
so we returned you the gift you gave us.

1789
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,570
It's a dummy?!

1790
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:05,440
The liquid explosives
were thoroughly analyzed,

1791
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:07,110
and a neutralizer was made

1792
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,780
by my capable subordinate.

1793
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:14,860
And that liquid was produced by us,
how do you like it?

1794
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:16,650
Furuya!

1795
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:25,650
Wait for me below!

1796
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:26,480
Amuro!

1797
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,610
I won't let you escape this time.

1798
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,480
I hate persistent men!

1799
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:46,820
What a reckless move!

1800
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:49,530
He leaped onto the helicopter
to fight the culprit...

1801
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:51,320
Conan, do you know him?

1802
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,900
I couldn't see his face behind the culprit.

1803
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:54,860
Let's head down!

1804
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,860
Wait!

1805
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:57,900
Who is that pilot?!

1806
01:31:58,820 --> 01:31:59,650
Eh? Seriously?

1807
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:00,980
Isn't that bad?

1808
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,440
Let go, you jerk!

1809
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:44,230
Your goal will no longer come true.

1810
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,150
Too bad!

1811
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:50,030
Damn!

1812
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:59,860
Get away from Shibuya, quick!

1813
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,030
There's a possibility of a terror attack!

1814
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,610
Evacuate as soon as possible!

1815
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:05,730
Please stay away from the station!

1816
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,030
Hurry!

1817
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:13,530
What's the commotion about?

1818
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:19,730
It'll be faster to walk there.

1819
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:21,610
According to the message Conan sent,

1820
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:24,150
we have to go wait for him
at the center of the intersection.

1821
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,530
That's what he wrote, right?

1822
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:26,860
Bringing this with us.

1823
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,190
Professor, can we go?

1824
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:30,280
Well...

1825
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,570
There's no other choice.

1826
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:35,360
Let's run!

1827
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,480
Yeah!

1828
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:39,280
Be very careful!

1829
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,400
Is this enough to stop the explosion?

1830
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:52,980
All because of you.

1831
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:56,150
All because of a jerk like you,

1832
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:58,730
my plan is completely ruined!

1833
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:03,730
Die!

1834
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:15,230
As a former policeman,
I can't let you commit more crimes.

1835
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:16,530
You're...

1836
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:18,570
You should leave this place immediately.

1837
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:19,820
What?

1838
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,610
You shouldn't be here, right?\

1839
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:23,610
Aren't you with
the Public Security Bureau?

1840
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:24,940
How did you know?!

1841
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:27,230
I've been a policeman for a long time.

1842
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,030
I just know it, from my instinct...

1843
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:33,690
But it seems like my instinct didn't work
when it came to my fiancée...

1844
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:36,780
Don't worry, I won't tell
the others about you.

1845
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,730
If we manage to survive this.

1846
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,110
Shoot her here and now.

1847
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:12,530
Kirill... I will avenge you, my son...

1848
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,030
No!

1849
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:18,650
Don't shoot, Erenka!

1850
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:19,820
Move aside, young boy!

1851
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:21,780
I'll shoot you too if you get in my way!

1852
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:25,230
Even if you shoot Plamya,
you can't bring your son back.

1853
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:28,110
What do you know?!

1854
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:30,860
My son, my husband, and my older brother,

1855
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,530
they were all killed by her!

1856
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:34,980
I can no longer return to my former life!

1857
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,230
I've done plenty of bad things too!

1858
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:39,190
All in order to kill her!

1859
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,360
I sacrificed everything to get this chance!!

1860
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,860
I won’t be satisfied
if I don't kill her with my own hands!

1861
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:46,320
Move aside, young boy!

1862
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:53,280
Why did they have to be killed?

1863
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:55,440
My husband was a policeman,

1864
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:59,780
and all he did was to arrest a murder suspect
whose parent is a politician!

1865
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,110
They tried to erase us
after testifying in court,

1866
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:05,360
my son being the collateral damage.

1867
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:08,150
Did my husband or son do anything wrong?

1868
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,650
Hey, tell me...

1869
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:28,030
We will definitely bring her to justice.

1870
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,190
So please, trust the Japanese police.

1871
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,820
Erenka, I need your help.

1872
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:39,730
To prevent any more tragedies from happening,
I need help from everyone.

1873
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:41,980
Let's stop Plamya's bomb together.

1874
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:47,150
Conan!

1875
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,190
Conan!

1876
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:50,070
Where are you?

1877
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,070
Ah!

1878
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:52,480
You guys! Why are you all here?!

1879
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:53,730
Let's talk later.

1880
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:55,280
We got this from the professor.

1881
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,110
Here, this is the new belt.

1882
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,440
Thank you.

1883
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:01,440
Darn it, we don't have much time left.

1884
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:03,150
It's here, too.

1885
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,400
There's no other choice.

1886
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,780
You've seen my message to Professor, right?

1887
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:08,900
Can you handle it?

1888
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:09,730
Yes.

1889
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:12,230
We have to hold the end
of this suspender and run...

1890
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,360
Then secure it around
guardrails or traffic lights, right?

1891
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,980
A piece of cake!

1892
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:19,980
We'll use the detective badges
to signal Edogawa once we're done.

1893
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:21,320
You can do it, right?

1894
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:21,980
Yeah!

1895
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:26,190
We need to help them.

1896
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:28,440
Get in touch with the others.

1897
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:30,190
Are you sure?

1898
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:32,900
This could be our last chance...

1899
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,440
The boy is right.

1900
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,610
We cannot let more people become like us.

1901
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:41,110
Okay.

1902
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:46,110
Muranaka!

1903
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:47,150
Megure!

1904
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:48,190
You came just in time.

1905
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,320
Have you got her?

1906
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,860
Yea, I'll leave the rest to you.

1907
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,860
I have to go now.

1908
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,400
Eh? Where are you going?

1909
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:02,570
It's flowing fast.

1910
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:03,530
Hurry up!

1911
01:38:05,230 --> 01:38:06,690
Just a little more!

1912
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:08,730
I will help.

1913
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:10,320
Do I just tie it here?

1914
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:12,320
Let me help you.

1915
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,650
Thank you.

1916
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,030
Thank you!

1917
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,150
Ready!

1918
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,230
Alright!

1919
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,030
It has already reached here...

1920
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:47,940
Hurry!

1921
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,360
Ayumi!

1922
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:04,070
Ayumi, hang in there!

1923
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:09,570
Are you okay?

1924
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,610
That’s a serious wound!

1925
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,440
Why didn't you say anything?!

1926
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,610
We can't possibly leave now...

1927
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,610
We have to hold this down...

1928
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:25,400
Fine, I understand!

1929
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:26,110
Edogawa!

1930
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:28,780
It'll be bad if the ball expands anymore!

1931
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,570
We have to secure it to
something more durable!

1932
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:34,110
We can't do this just by ourselves!

1933
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,400
Darn!

1934
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,230
We need more people, but...

1935
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:40,150
- Takagi!
- Detective Takagi!

1936
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:41,690
Everyone was evacuated!

1937
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:42,900
There's no other people around!

1938
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:45,400
At this rate,
Shibuya will be engulfed in flames...

1939
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:47,230
Ran!

1940
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:49,780
Shinichi?

1941
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,190
Hang in there, Takagi!

1942
01:39:57,650 --> 01:39:59,150
We will help you, young boy.

1943
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:01,650
Sergey! Everyone!

1944
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,280
Erenka, you are our leader.

1945
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,400
We'll follow the path you lead us on.

1946
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:08,150
Everyone agreed.

1947
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:09,530
Don't take it all on yourself.

1948
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,030
Thank you.

1949
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:17,440
Ready... Pull!

1950
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:22,230
Ready... Pull!

1951
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,730
This should be good enough now.

1952
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,860
We have secured this side too!

1953
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,440
It's perfect!

1954
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:37,150
Mission complete!

1955
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,400
Thank you, you all!

1956
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,650
Who is he really, that boy?

1957
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:51,230
Conan!

1958
01:40:56,230 --> 01:41:00,530
Go!

1959
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,280
Hold on tight!

1960
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,400
It's stopped.

1961
01:41:58,230 --> 01:41:59,440
Here you are.

1962
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,400
Is everything going to be alright?

1963
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,360
We just need another one hour or so,

1964
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,230
and it'll be completely neutralized.

1965
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,860
As expected from the PSB, so efficient.

1966
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:11,150
You are more impressive.

1967
01:42:12,030 --> 01:42:13,780
How did you come up with that solution?

1968
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:16,360
I got a hint from someone...

1969
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,530
It was quite a long time ago...

1970
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:23,150
(Seven Years Ago)

1971
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,650
It's all Shinichi's fault for
hitting the ball at such a bad spot...

1972
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:28,980
Stop crying, Ran. It'll be alright.

1973
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,530
Darn!

1974
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:34,280
Hey, boy!

1975
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,030
Don't make your woman cry.

1976
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,110
It stopped!

1977
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:50,690
Hagi, what are you doing?

1978
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:52,190
Jinpei! Phone!

1979
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:53,320
Call the Bureau of Waterworks!

1980
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,570
What? Why?!

1981
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:57,820
I suddenly remembered that.

1982
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:01,900
And I thought I can stop the explosion
using the same method...

1983
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,110
That person kind of resembled
that Hagiwara guy.

1984
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,900
Is anything wrong?

1985
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:12,150
No,

1986
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,730
it's nothing.

1987
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,150
Strange... They were here just now!

1988
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,190
Where did they go?

1989
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:24,320
We were all saved because of their help!

1990
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,480
If they hadn't been here,

1991
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:27,860
Shibuya will be engulfed in flames right now.

1992
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:30,980
Takagi!

1993
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:32,150
Hang in there!

1994
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:33,940
Sato...

1995
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,400
Hey, lend me a hand!

1996
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,360
Yes!

1997
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:38,690
Sato,

1998
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:43,780
I think, I will have to
undergo a surgery after this...

1999
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:44,980
Y-Yes.

2000
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:48,190
Can I have a lucky charm for that?

2001
01:43:48,650 --> 01:43:49,650
Lucky charm?

2002
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:54,860
Sheesh...

2003
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,650
If you still have that much
strength, you’ll be fine.

2004
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,900
Sato...

2005
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,400
Takagi!

2006
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:18,280
How dare you just die like that.

2007
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,480
You idiot!

2008
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,320
Restrain them!

2009
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:30,530
You thugs!

2010
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:32,820
Go, go!

2011
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:33,940
Yes!

2012
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:34,530
That's right!

2013
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:42,190
Wait, I was just resting in the hospital

2014
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,150
What's going on now?!

2015
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,860
What are you doing?!

2016
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:49,980
There's a threat sent to the
Chief of Police's grandmother's funeral!

2017
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:51,940
Don't let your guard down
just because it’s a drill!

2018
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,070
Yes!

2019
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:55,110
Do...

2020
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:58,190
Do I have to be in this attire?

2021
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:00,320
Hey!

2022
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,320
Hey!
