1
00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:07,133
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,383
A super-creepy bandaged man!

3
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,513
I won't let him
go after Ran anymore!

4
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,603
He sees the single truth
for what it is,

5
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,983
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,353
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,300
Ran and I met Suzuki Sonoko
at her mountain villa

8
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,010
to view the autumn leaves.

9
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,380
Also there was Sonoko's sister
and graduate student, Ayako,

10
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,850
Ayako's old college friend and
import car broker, Ota Masaru,

11
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,930
the film magazine editor,
Sumiya Hiroki,

12
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,150
the food company employee,
Takahashi Ryoichi,

13
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,070
and scriptwriter Ikeda Chikako,
for a total of eight people.

14
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,900
The incidents began when
a creepy man in bandages

15
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,390
tried to kill Ran in the forest!

16
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,160
That night, after the only
bridge out was destroyed,

17
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,810
Ikeda Chikako was caught
and killed by the bandaged man!

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,720
And then he tried
to kill Ran again!

19
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,310
Why? Why is he after Ran?!

20
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,140
The Mountain Lodge Bandage
Man Murder Case (Part 2).

21
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,820
What?!

22
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,610
She was attacked again?!

23
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,360
By that bandaged man?!

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,430
Apparently so...

25
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,480
Are you all right?

26
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,430
Yeah!

27
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,870
But how did he get in?

28
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,140
You did lock the window, right?

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,790
Yes...

30
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,280
Hey!

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,720
What is it?

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,250
The window's been cut!

33
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,350
Aha!

34
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,210
He put his hand through to unlock it!

35
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,890
But we're on the 2nd floor!
How'd he get up here?

36
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,670
Ota! There!

37
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,640
He must've used that tree
to climb onto the veranda!

38
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,740
This is one serious guy...

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,680
And then he--

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,640
That's odd--
it's pouring outside!

41
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,180
If he snuck in from out there,

42
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,310
it's safe to assume
he would track mud inside...

43
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,060
But there isn't any at all!

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,540
Why?!

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,490
Anyway, it's dangerous to be alone.

46
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,350
Let's all wait in the
dining room until morning.

47
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,450
Good call...

48
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,810
I hate piggyback rides!
They're so stupid!

49
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,640
What are you talking about?
You sprained your ankle!

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,850
Ayako-san. Isn't that the thing

51
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,970
Chikako-san was
wearing around her neck?

52
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,130
Yes, this is Chikako's choker.

53
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,640
Right after you and the others
chased after the bandaged man,

54
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,100
I found it lying
by the front door.

55
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,010
What the hell is the guy thinking?!

56
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,980
Killing Chikako and
attacking Ran-chan twice!

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,820
What if he wants to kill us all?

58
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,170
No way...

59
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,230
You can't be serious...

60
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,240
That's strange.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,830
He carried Chikako-san
into the forest afterward,

62
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,350
so if her choker did fall off,
it would've been there.

63
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,790
So what was it doing
by the front door?

64
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,100
Why didn't you use your karate
to beat him up when he attacked you?

65
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,680
That's not like you, Ran!

66
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,760
I couldn't help it; I'm scared
of monsters and stuff like that...

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,480
There's no need to worry.

68
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,350
There's six of us,
and one of him.

69
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,900
I doubt he's dumb
enough to attack six--

70
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,610
Ota-san?

71
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,520
Ow!

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,010
Ouch!

73
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,030
Conan-kun!

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,450
What the hell was that for?!

75
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,910
There's seven people here, not six!

76
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,140
You're just a kid;
you don't count!

77
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
That's not true.

78
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,430
He protected me
when I was attacked!

79
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,340
Isn't that right?

80
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,840
Thanks!

81
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,600
Say, Ran. Did you get
a look at the guy's face?

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,310
No...

83
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,350
I know his build, though!

84
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,850
I couldn't see his face since
it was wrapped in bandages,

85
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,440
but I know his figure because
of when I jumped onto him...

86
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,900
His chest was about this big,

87
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,970
so he wasn't especially skinny or fat...

88
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,350
Like we can believe
what some kid says.

89
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,710
Sumiya-san's video camera!

90
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm pretty sure he was recording
when the bandaged man

91
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,830
ran off with Chikako-san...

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,390
There he is!

93
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,980
Just as I thought,
she has the choker on!

94
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,350
Which means that her body,
which the bandaged man

95
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,270
was holding when they
passed by the window,

96
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,280
somehow went through this lodge.

97
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,180
Someone inside this lodge
could have carried her

98
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,240
through the house
and out into the forest.

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,910
But everyone was in this room
when she was taken!

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,010
Shall I make us some coffee?

101
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,260
Yeah, good idea.

102
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,300
Say. You were the last one
to see Chikako-san, right?

103
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,560
Yes...

104
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,740
Did she seem out of
the ordinary at all?

105
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,560
Now that you mention it,

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,610
she read a note that had been
slipped beneath her door...

107
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,230
She suddenly turned very pale...

108
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,200
Ah, so she was drawn
outside by that note!

109
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,830
That's why her slippers
were by the back door--

110
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,470
that's where she snuck out from...

111
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,680
And only someone on the inside
could have put the note there.

112
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,550
Does that mean the killer
is in this room?!

113
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,260
But why did he try
to kill Ran twice?

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,010
I don't know his motive
for killing Chikako-san,

115
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,060
but why Ran, who came here
at a moment's notice?

116
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,020
Wait a minute! What if she had--

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,610
I'm sorry! My mistake!

118
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,720
Hey, Ran-neechan.

119
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,460
What?

120
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,100
When we got here,

121
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,570
you opened everyone's door
by accident, right?

122
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,610
Yeah...

123
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,140
Did you see anything?

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,520
Like what?

125
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,390
Like a cape or bandages?

126
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,040
Don't tell me
this kid suspects us?!

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,470
Don't pay attention to him;
he just loves playing detective!

128
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,660
You really didn't see anything?

129
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,010
I didn't see anything!

130
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,470
They were all changing clothes
so I shut the doors right away!

131
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,810
Now that I think about it,

132
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,430
something's been
bugging me ever since...

133
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,100
I don't think it was important,

134
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,190
but I can't remember what it was...

135
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,940
Try to remember, Ran-neechan!

136
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,810
The power's out!

137
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,150
The lightning knocked out a power line!

138
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm scared!

139
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,120
I'll get candles from the kitchen!

140
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
You gonna be alright by yourself?

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,900
I'll come with you!

142
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,450
Me too!

143
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,680
This should help
for a little while...

144
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,720
What was that?

145
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,680
It came from the dining room.

146
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,220
Could it be the bandaged man again?!

147
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,310
Are you okay, Conan-kun?!

148
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,970
That was mean, Ran-neechan!

149
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,970
I'm so sorry!

150
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,140
That's--

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,650
Isn't that an axe?

152
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,610
So that person just now was--

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,700
The bandaged man is after Ran!

154
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,680
But why her?!

155
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,080
That sounded like Sonoko!

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
Ran-neechan! Come on! Hurry!

157
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,670
The upstairs window is broken!

158
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,970
Ran-neechan!
Go up to the window!

159
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,510
Ayako-san!
Could you hold these?!

160
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,510
Look at this mess!

161
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,060
The floor's covered
in broken glass!

162
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,440
The bandaged man must've
broken through this window...

163
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,190
No, he didn't!

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,150
One of the locks is undone!

165
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,920
If he really did break in
through this window...

166
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,870
...then it should still be locked!

167
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,330
But it's not!

168
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,430
Most likely, he unlocked it
from the inside,

169
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,550
stepped onto the veranda,
closed the window,

170
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,010
and then smashed it to make it
look like he broke in from outside!

171
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,060
He snuck in from
the 2nd floor again?!

172
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,140
Yeah, he probably jumped
onto the veranda from that tree...

173
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,720
No doubt about it!

174
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,390
The maniac who killed Chikako-san

175
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,110
and attacked Ran three times
is in this very room!

176
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,630
What are those grooves?

177
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,890
That's it! Now I understand!

178
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,120
That was a trick!

179
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,210
Thanks, Ran-neechan!

180
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,520
But why is the bandaged man
intent on killing Ran?

181
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,180
What exactly did she see?

182
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,850
I didn't see anything!

183
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,350
They were all changing clothes
so I shut the doors right away!

184
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,970
What if he's actually--

185
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,560
So the bandaged man really is him!

186
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,940
If so, then the three mysteries--

187
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,930
the reason why the bandaged
man passed by the window

188
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,860
with Chikako-san
for everyone to see,

189
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,700
how he was able to carry the body
into the forest unnoticed,

190
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,910
and the reason he's after Ran--

191
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,260
they all fit!

192
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,870
Alright!

193
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,290
Ran's the only detective
I can use here!

194
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,580
Say, where are the candles
I gave you earlier?

195
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,920
I missed!

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,470
Sonoko?

197
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,890
What's wrong, Sonoko?!

198
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,810
Damn! I have no choice
but to use Sonoko now!

199
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,260
Sonoko!

200
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,730
I just figured it out...

201
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,310
I know who killed Chikako-san!

202
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,758
I just figured it out...

203
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:16,618
I know who killed Chikako-san!

204
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:19,718
What're you talking about,
Sonoko-chan?

205
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:22,848
The killer's obviously
that bandaged guy!

206
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:25,388
Yeah. He's probably
in the forest right now,

207
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:27,598
just waiting to get us!

208
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:30,848
Do you really think there's
such a person in the forest?

209
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:37,888
Think back to the state of Ran's
room when she was attacked...

210
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:41,478
He broke in through the veranda, right?

211
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:45,938
Yeah. He jumped onto the
upstairs veranda from a tree.

212
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:49,898
Then why were there no
mud tracks in Ran's room?

213
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,388
It was raining outside
when the bandaged man snuck in.

214
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:56,428
Now that you mention it!

215
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:57,868
The reason is simple.

216
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:01,828
It was because the bandaged
man was inside the lodge!

217
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:07,048
The point of entry was most likely
Chikako-san's room, right next to Ran's.

218
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:10,968
The killer exited onto the veranda,
entered Ran's room, and attacked her.

219
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,758
But then she screamed...

220
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:19,758
...and he hastily ran
back to Chikako-san's room!

221
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:23,518
He quickly changed his clothes

222
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:29,178
and met everyone in Ran's room
with feigned unawareness.

223
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:33,898
In other words, the maniac who
killed Chikako-san and attacked Ran

224
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:36,078
is in this very room!

225
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:40,298
Sonoko-chan. Playing
detective is nice and all,

226
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,098
but think clearly.

227
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,788
When the bandaged dude
ran past the window,

228
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,428
every one of us
was inside the lodge!

229
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:54,008
None of us could possibly be him!

230
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:57,848
But if you used a dummy
and some piano wire,

231
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:00,968
it'd be possible to make it
seem that way from inside!

232
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:02,428
A dummy?

233
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:06,848
Yes. An inflatable one, most likely.

234
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:10,758
He affixed Chikako-san's
body to the dummy,

235
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:14,358
and attached two piano wires
to the dummy's head.

236
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:19,428
He passed one wire through
the central veranda's railing,

237
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:24,758
tied both ends of the wires to the
railing above the window in question,

238
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:28,138
and then cut the wire
that went through the railing.

239
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:34,548
After he swung it
past the window,

240
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:38,508
he quickly recovered
the dummy and Chikako-san!

241
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:40,098
Chikako!

242
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,758
The only one who
could've pulled that off

243
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,728
was the person on the veranda,
fixing the roof...

244
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,638
...you, Takahashi-san!

245
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:53,688
You're kidding, right,
Sonoko-chan?

246
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:58,608
The two distinct piano wire
marks on the outside railing...

247
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:00,568
...are proof!

248
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:03,258
Only the stage manager
for your old filmmaking club

249
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:08,798
could've set up
something so elaborate!

250
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,138
You can't be serious...

251
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:14,538
Then what did I do with
the body after I pulled it up?

252
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,928
Right after that, we all
chased him into the forest,

253
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:22,968
where we found
Chikako's body in pieces.

254
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:28,028
Did you see me carrying any bodies?

255
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:28,758
No...

256
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:31,228
There is proof
that you carried her.

257
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:36,068
My sister found Chikako-san's
choker by the door.

258
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:40,028
She was wearing that choker
when she was abducted.

259
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:43,948
The fact that it was by the
front door after everyone left

260
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:48,908
means that someone went through
the door, carrying her body!

261
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:53,138
I already told you,
I wasn't carrying anything!

262
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:57,628
Besides, nobody could carry
the body without being noticed...

263
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:59,548
Assuming it was the body.

264
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:01,928
But if it were just the head...

265
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,548
...it would be entirely possible to carry!

266
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,888
Eh?!

267
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:09,598
After all, all that we
saw outside the window

268
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:12,388
was her head surrounded by a cape!

269
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,438
Her body had been
torn apart when we found it...

270
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:18,148
This is ridiculous!

271
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:23,258
Why would I want to
kill her and Ran-chan?!

272
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:27,078
And besides--

273
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:28,658
And besides what?

274
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,038
Why won't you say it?

275
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,458
Isn't there proof?

276
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:40,418
You and the bandaged man
have completely different figures...

277
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:43,968
That's right, Takahashi-kun!

278
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,298
The bandaged man isn't fat!

279
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,718
Takahashi!
Why didn't you say so?

280
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:54,098
He was afraid of what
I would ask in response:

281
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,608
"Are you really, truly fat?"

282
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:02,528
That's right.
He's not fat at all!

283
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,488
He stuffed the head in his
shirt and carried it out!

284
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:10,738
First, he lured Chikako-san
into the forest, ripped her apart,

285
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:14,718
replaced the padding under
his shirt with her head,

286
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,758
and carried it back to the lodge.

287
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:20,258
Then, after doing
the trick on the veranda,

288
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:23,718
he stuffed the deflated dummy
and head under his shirt

289
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,428
and headed for the forest
with everyone else.

290
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:28,638
Then he dumped
the head in the forest

291
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:30,758
while pretending to look for her.

292
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:35,548
In other words, this was
a daring and clever trick

293
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:42,108
in which he faked his figure
to freely move the corpse around!

294
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:46,968
By using this trick,
he was able to make it look like

295
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:52,118
the bandaged man took Chikako-san
into the forest and killed her,

296
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:56,538
and that he was responsible
for everything that happened!

297
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:59,998
But his supposedly-perfect plan

298
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,958
began to mess up
when Ran did something...

299
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:08,048
Yes. When she accidentally
opened his door,

300
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:09,718
she saw it...

301
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:15,308
...his real figure!

302
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,268
She hadn't thought
much of it at the time,

303
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:23,758
but if she did remember,
his carefully-planned murder plot

304
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:26,188
would go up in smoke!

305
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,458
That's why he attacked
her in the forest--

306
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,118
to keep her quiet!

307
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:34,578
But he failed.

308
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:38,428
Worried that Chikako-san
would go down the mountain

309
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:40,538
during all the commotion,

310
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:44,708
he cut the phone line,
destroyed the bridge,

311
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:47,798
and shut everyone up inside the lodge!

312
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:52,548
He lured Chikako-san
into the forest as planned

313
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,638
and then murdered her.

314
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,758
She was lured out by the note

315
00:18:56,758 --> 00:19:00,268
that he most likely
slipped under her door.

316
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:05,928
It was probably about
fellow club member Atsuko-san,

317
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,698
who committed suicide
two years ago--

318
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:11,758
It's true!
I did it all for Atsuko!

319
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,158
T-Takahashi...

320
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:19,388
She secretly showed me
a story she had written,

321
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:23,078
and her eyes sparkled as she told
me her dream of being a novelist.

322
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:26,928
Then, one day, she hanged
herself in our meeting room!

323
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:30,718
Once I saw Chikako's
latest movie, "Blue Kingdom,"

324
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:33,508
I suddenly knew why she did it!

325
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:35,898
"Blue Kingdom"?\

326
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,468
Don't tell me she-

327
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,508
That's right. The story
for Chikako's debut work

328
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:46,398
was exactly the same as the "Azure
Country" story that Atsuko showed me!

329
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,208
You mean Chikako...

330
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,348
...stole it?!

331
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:52,238
Yeah. The story won Chikako
a new scriptwriter's award

332
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,578
while she was still in school,
and now she's famous!

333
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,758
But how do we know
that led to Atsuko's suicide?

334
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:04,098
The day Chikako won the award--
the day before Atsuko died--

335
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:06,168
Atsuko told me over the phone

336
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,128
that she couldn't trust
anyone anymore!

337
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:14,638
So I lured Chikako into
the forest with a blackmail note

338
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:17,968
and then I chopped her head off!

339
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:20,928
That's what she gets
for crushing Atsuko's dream!

340
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:25,858
It's all over now...

341
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:29,938
It's time for me to see Atsuko...

342
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,528
Hold on, Takahashi!

343
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:32,608
Stay away!

344
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,358
Takahashi-kun!

345
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:36,598
I'm going to live
with her in the next world

346
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:38,718
as the messenger of
justice who avenged her!

347
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,828
Stop fooling yourself!

348
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:44,798
If you wanna die, then die!

349
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:46,788
Sonoko...

350
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:51,758
Maybe you did commit
a crime for Atsuko's sake.

351
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,928
But when you attacked Ran,

352
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:56,718
it wasn't for her sake at all!

353
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:58,258
You were afraid!

354
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:02,048
You were afraid of being labeled
a criminal, so you attacked her!

355
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:03,688
You're no...

356
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,638
...messenger of justice!

357
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:10,608
You're just an ugly,
bloodthirsty killer!

358
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:28,598
A friend's betrayal
led to a friend's death,

359
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:32,638
which, in turn,
twisted a friend's heart...

360
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:38,218
At long last, the villa breaks
free of the cold and tragic night...

361
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:40,098
But beware!

362
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,718
Let your guard down,
and he'll appear

363
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,848
from a person's heart again...

364
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:49,258
The crazed killer known as "revenge."

365
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:24,778
I'm glad your
sister is doing better now!

366
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,798
Yeah, me too.

367
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,208
She stayed in bed for a whole
week after it happened...

368
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:33,928
But it was all thanks
to your great detective skills

369
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,668
that the case was solved!

370
00:23:37,008 --> 00:23:37,508
Eh?

371
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,258
Uh oh!

372
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,258
You make a pretty cool
detective, you know that?

373
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:44,758
I better change the topic!

374
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,928
Hey, guess what--

375
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:50,348
Yeah, well, cases like that
are as easy as pie for me.

376
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,308
Shinichi-kun and
your dad are out of luck...

377
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:59,238
It's the great detective
Suzuki Sonoko's time now!

378
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:07,468
Having her be the detective
was definitely a big mistake...

379
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,338
Dr. Yoko has a motive
for killing Nakamoto-san.

380
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:19,168
But she has an airtight alibi!

381
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,628
If she was the killer, then--

382
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:24,588
There's no VCR here...

383
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:28,218
Aha! So that's how!

384
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:34,638
This was an alibi trick
involving Ayumi-chan!

385
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:37,598
On the next Conan--

386
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:41,528
"The Monday, 7:30 P.M. Murder Case."

387
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,642
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:00,648
Next Conan's Hint:
Curtains.

389
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:02,313
Curtains.
