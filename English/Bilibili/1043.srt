(Shiraishi Kazuya (21)
University Student - Figure Circle Mesoba)

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,405
Is that the delivery service?

6
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,116
No, I'm sure
it's Mitsuhiko and his friends.

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,326
Mitsuhiko?

8
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,828
He's a kid from the neighbourhood.

9
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,414
I promised him that
I'd show him my figurines.

10
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,417
Are you saying
a bunch of kids are coming here now?

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,335
I was the one who invited them.

12
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,921
Mitsuhiko said he likes Yaiba, after all.

13
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,133
The contest deadline
is just around the corner!

14
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,427
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,014
Besides, Shiraishi, you're the reason
we're so close to the deadline.

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,515
What did you say?

17
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,935
You got cigarette ash on it,
so we had to do it all over again.

18
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,228
But you were the one...

19
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,521
Calm down, now.

20
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,608
They're already here,
so stop fighting.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,238
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,240
of unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,825
Students fired up by figurines.

24
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,036
Friendships breaking apart
by the fanning of flames.

25
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,412
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,331
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,833
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,700
"Figurine of Revenge"

(Figurine of Revenge)

30
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,403
It's beautiful.

31
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,531
Did everyone make all of these?

32
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:23,036
Yes, everyone here
who's in the circle made them.

33
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,123
- I see. That's amazing!
- A... a gun!

34
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,004
What are you doing?

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,132
The gun is glowing!

36
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,800
What's going on?

37
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,430
It's just a lighter
in the shape of a gun.

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,932
A lighter?

39
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,309
Ayumi?

40
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,020
Hey! How long are you going
to hold on to him?

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,439
Get off her, Conan!

42
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,609
You're all moving around so much
and making a lot of noise!

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,402
If you're going to be a nuisance,
just go home!

44
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,905
Hey! That's not
how you should tell them off.

45
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,406
What did you say?

46
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,200
Aoki, how about you show them

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,327
the Yaiba figurines you're so proud of?

48
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,830
That's right! It would be great, Aoki.

49
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,624
You're right.

50
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,002
That's awesome!

51
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,629
There are so many Yaibas!

52
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,507
This is a limited edition Yaiba, isn't it?

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,717
I'll be back right away,

54
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,427
so you guys can hang out here in the meantime.

55
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,304
Sure!

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,019
Why did you have to invite those kids?

57
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,813
I said I'm sorry.

58
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,232
Even if we can't make it in time for the contest,

59
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,401
we could always display it
at the university festival.

60
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,320
No way! We have to submit it to the contest

61
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,406
and win no matter what!

62
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,534
I don't mind not winning the contest.

63
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,328
My future is on the line here!

64
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,206
Future? Do you mean your employment?

65
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,002
Hey, Shiraishi,
are you hiding something from us?

66
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,713
Shut up! It's none of your business!

67
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,216
Anyway, we have to
make it to the deadline, okay?

68
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,509
It's fine.

69
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,928
We only need to send pictures
for the first stage of judging,

70
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,420
so we can just upload them
to the website by the end of the day.

71
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,600
By the end of the day?
But the deadline is tomorrow!

72
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,630
Tomorrow's the anniversary of Yuri's death, so...

73
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,730
I'd like to visit her grave
and show her our work.

74
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,820
It was her dream to
enter the contest and win it, after all.

75
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,411
Yes. Out of all of us,

76
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,150
Yuri was the one
who had the most sense for it.

77
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,124
No matter how talented she was,

78
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,209
it doesn't matter now that she's dead.

79
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,000
Watch your words, Shiraishi.

80
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,131
Is she helping with the filing
in the afterlife?

81
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,925
Hey, stop smoking right now.

82
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,635
Shiraishi!

83
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,023
Outstanding Design Award, you say?

84
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,903
- What?
- Conan, incoming!

85
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,822
Go!

86
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,032
Come on.

87
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,202
Ouch!

88
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,204
It's you again!

89
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,122
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,924
Are you okay, Conan?

91
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,008
Yes.

92
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,804
Hey, Genta, what are you going
to do if this breaks?

93
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,432
Put it back where it was
and don't touch it anymore.

94
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,228
- I know.
- Conan? Where are you going?

95
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,230
I'm going to the toilet! The toilet.

96
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,525
It's no good. It's going to leave a stain.

97
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,527
It's all right. Don't mind it.

98
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,821
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,823
The bottle is all empty now.

100
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,035
What is this?

101
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,122
This can't be.

102
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,915
No.

103
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,334
There's no doubting it.

104
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,920
He's been pushed that far.

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,423
But I also understand his feelings.

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,050
After all, Yuri ended up like that because...

107
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,220
Yes. I can't allow it, either.

108
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,725
Yes, I can make it in time somehow.

109
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,938
So, things will go as promised, right?

110
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,250
If I win the contest,

111
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,600
I'll receive a tentative offer
from your company.

112
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,319
Conan, what are you doing over there?

113
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,404
Nothing.

114
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,907
Mr. Mizuhara bought us
some ice cream and juice drinks!

115
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,617
Come on!

116
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,329
There are so many of them!

117
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,206
You can choose whichever one you like.

118
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,000
Which one am I going to get?

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,419
Where's Shiraishi?

120
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,920
He's probably working on something.

121
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,131
I'll bring these to him.

122
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,604
Shiraishi said he'll eat
when he's done with some more work.

123
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,938
I see.

124
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,317
That was delicious!

125
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,903
Genta, you've finished your ice cream?

126
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,239
But I want to eat more!

127
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,033
I'll give you my share, then.

128
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,534
Really?

129
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,702
You can have it.

130
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,914
By the way, do you want
to watch some Yaiba DVDs?

131
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,207
Yes, we do.

132
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,500
Just wait for a while.

133
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,634
Which one shall we watch?

134
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,805
Is it a blackout?

135
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
No!

136
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,728
But something must have
happened in the next room!

137
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,730
It's dangerous in there.

138
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,815
Shiraishi!

139
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,901
Shiraishi, are you okay?

140
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,027
Shiraishi!

141
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,238
Conan.

142
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,032
There seems to be an explosion.

143
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
Gosh, the door is locked!

144
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,204
Shiraishi, unlock the door! Shiraishi!

145
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,415
Mizuhara! Bring the door key here!

146
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,917
Yes.

147
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,835
- You guys hurry on outside
- Shiraishi!

148
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,212
and call the fire department!

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,338
- Got it!
- Hey! Answer us!

150
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,215
- Let's go!
- Yes.

151
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,510
- Shiraishi.
- Answer us, Shiraishi!

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,819
Where were you when the fire occurred?

153
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,407
Yes, sir. We were with the kids
in the living room.

154
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,326
We all had ice cream together.

155
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,705
And then, there was a big explosion,
and the lights went out.

156
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,624
That's when we heard another explosion.

157
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,835
You heard two explosions.

158
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,503
What did you do after that?

159
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,924
Of course, we wanted to help Shiraishi,
so we went to the workroom.

160
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,510
But the door was locked.

161
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,429
Is it usually locked?

162
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,140
No, sir. The kids were visiting today,

163
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,017
so maybe that's why he locked it.

164
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,311
So that he wouldn't be disturbed
while working.

165
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,812
I see.

166
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,524
If I had found the key sooner.

167
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,402
So, what was the cause of the fire?

168
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,405
A lighter was found on the floor,

169
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,825
so it's likely the room caught fire

170
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,037
when he tried to
light a cigarette or something.

171
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,705
Excuse me.

172
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,417
But there was a different noise
before the lights went out.

173
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,210
A different noise?

174
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,338
Excuse me, Inspector.

175
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,506
How is Shiraishi doing?

176
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,218
I'm sorry to say, but he seems to
have inhaled a lot of smoke,

177
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,430
so by the time he was brought
to the hospital, he was already...

178
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,140
That can't be.

179
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,439
I'm sure one of the sounds
was not an explosion.

180
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,107
What could it be?

181
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,030
What are those?

182
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,617
It's a rubber glove and some copper wire.

183
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,203
A rubber glove and some copper wire?

184
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,415
The wall socket is burnt.

185
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,709
So that must have been
what made the sound!

186
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,932
The fire seems to have burned
the most around the rubbish bins.

187
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,517
What is this?

188
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,312
This must be the lighter.

189
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:32,233
But if I recall, his lighter...

190
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,237
That's a thinner bottle.

191
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,322
And not only is the bottle open

192
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,908
but there's also a nylon thread tied to it.

193
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,535
Could this be...

194
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,203
Hey, kid!

195
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,331
You shouldn't come in here without permission!

196
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,208
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,835
It's just that Officer Takagi

198
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,004
told me to ask if there were
any lighters other than the one

199
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,923
shaped like a gun.

200
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,634
No, I don't think there were any.

201
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,428
So there weren't any other lighters?

202
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,805
Come on, now! Hurry out.

203
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,517
And one more thing. What is that?

204
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,228
It's probably an exploded plastic bottle.

205
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,106
It changed shape because of the heat,
so it's hard to tell.

206
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,025
An exploded plastic bottle?

207
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,822
He must have...

208
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,411
I see.

209
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,538
So that's how it is.

210
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,833
But why would the thinner bottle be there?

211
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,128
It's from Dr. Agasa.

212
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,504
Hello?

213
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,302
Hey, Miss Saki.

214
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:45,806
Why are the windows in that room
boarded up with cardboard?

215
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,101
Mizuhara broke the windowpane yesterday.

216
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,813
We put the cardboard up
as a temporary measure.

217
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,440
So I see.

218
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,401
But don't you usually have the window open
when you're painting?

219
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,528
We do have it open most of the time.

220
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,906
But we thought
we wouldn't be painting much today,

221
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,824
so it would be okay.

222
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,535
Is everyone ready?

223
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,207
We investigated the scene
and found it's highly likely

224
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:15,127
that someone caused the fire on purpose.

225
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,922
First, about the blackout.

226
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,634
The wall socket next to the TV stand is burnt.

227
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,514
A rubber glove and some copper wire
were also found on the balcony.

228
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,725
In other words, we found evidence that

229
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,602
someone intentionally caused a blackout

230
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,103
by feeding copper wire
into the wall socket,

231
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,522
resulting in a short circuit.

232
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,024
When we heard the first explosion,

233
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:42,238
someone was next to the TV
looking for Yaiba DVDs.

234
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,240
It was Mr. Mizuhara.

235
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,327
What do you have to say, Mizuhara?

236
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,704
I don't know what you are talking about.

237
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,333
But why would Mizuhara do such a thing?

238
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,420
There were two explosions
at the time of the incident, right?

239
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm sure it was because
the different solvents in the room

240
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,425
exploded at different times.

241
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,429
But most of the burning happened
near the rubbish bins

242
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,224
and where Shiraishi was lying down.

243
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,434
Other areas weren't as burnt.

244
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,730
It means the solvents
didn't explode one after another.

245
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,024
Speaking of which, there was
an exploded plastic bottle

246
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,110
that fell to the floor.

247
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
This must be it.

248
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,532
It must have been filled with dry ice

249
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,034
and made to explode.

250
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,038
How would it explode?

251
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,834
When you put dry ice in a plastic bottle
and close it,

252
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,003
the pressure from the sublimating dry ice

253
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,338
can make the bottle explode.

254
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,009
It's dangerous, so don't try it at home.

255
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,011
Yes.

256
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,307
The sound of the explosion
was to signal the timing of the blackout.

257
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:56,020
And the blackout was
the trigger that led to whatever

258
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,730
caused the fire.

259
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,232
This was the item that caused the fire.

260
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,028
This thinner bottle with a nylon thread tied to it

261
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,030
was found in the room.

262
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:11,535
Mizuhara, when you brought
the ice cream to Shiraishi,

263
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:16,415
you had already put dry ice
in a plastic bottle filled with water.

264
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:21,420
You opened the tied thinner bottle
you prepared beforehand

265
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,423
and put it alongside the plastic bottle
on a shelf next to the door

266
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,924
before leaving the room.

267
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,637
The other end of the nylon thread
was tied to the lock on the door.

268
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,432
After that, the plastic bottle exploded.

269
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,226
The force caused the thinner bottle to fall

270
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,605
and pull the nylon thread
so that the door is locked.

271
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:44,318
And the thinner poured out
of the fallen thinner bottle.

272
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,821
If Shiraishi lit his cigarette at that moment,

273
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,240
he would ignite the thinner
and cause the explosion.

274
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,036
However, he wouldn't necessarily think
to smoke at that time.

275
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:58,207
That's why you used
the sound of the plastic bottle exploding

276
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,627
to cause a blackout and darken the room.

277
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,633
Breaking the glass window

278
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,718
and putting up cardboard
as a temporary measure

279
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,512
were probably done for that purpose as well.

280
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,931
Excuse me, officers.

281
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,724
What do you mean by causing a blackout

282
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,602
because he wouldn't necessarily think
to smoke at that time?

283
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,106
I don't think he would smoke
just because the room got dark.

284
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,025
Wouldn't he turn the lights on again
because the room got dark?

285
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,403
But there was a blackout!

286
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,321
You're right.

287
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,033
Put yourselves in
Mr. Shiraishi's shoes and think.

288
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:38,038
What would you do if a plastic bottle
exploded and the room got dark?

289
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,419
I'd use a lighter to light up the room.

290
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,215
Mizuhara. To ensure that a fire would occur,

291
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,426
you robbed Shiraishi of his sight

292
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,720
and took his smartphone
and lighter out of the room.

293
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,639
Then, he would be forced
to use the gun-like lighter

294
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,518
painted with glow-in-the-dark paint
next to the door.

295
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,813
Conan found a smartphone and a lighter

296
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,524
in an ice cream box that was in the freezer.

297
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,318
Not only that.

298
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,238
Judging by the severe burning
in the rubbish bins,

299
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,824
you must have placed a lot of tissues

300
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,327
doused with flammable fluids in them.

301
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,414
How about that, Mizuhara?

302
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,207
What will you say to it?

303
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,001
I'm sorry!

304
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:29,631
Before the fire occurred,
I spilt a lot of ethanol

305
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,425
and used the tissues to wipe it off!

306
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,010
So that's why...

307
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,803
Saki is not at fault here!

308
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,430
I was the one who told her to do it.

309
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,017
So this is an accident! Please believe us!

310
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,520
The conversation I heard was indeed...

311
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,439
This can't be.

312
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,232
No.

313
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,401
There's no doubting it.

314
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,029
He's been pushed that far.

315
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,408
It was the two of them noticing
what Mr. Mizuhara was planning.

316
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,618
Wait.

317
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,329
But I also understand his feelings.

318
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,123
After all, Yuri ended up like that because...

319
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,335
Yes. I can't allow it, either.

320
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,004
Could they... could they be the ones...

321
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,923
Please think of it as a coincidence!

322
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,509
Gosh, so that's how it is!

323
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,929
Dr. Agasa? Where are you now?

324
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,931
As I said, it was only...

325
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,934
That's enough, you two.

326
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,311
It's just as the police said.

327
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,730
So, you are admitting to it.

328
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,609
- Yes.
- But why would you do such a thing?

329
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
It's for Yuri's sake.

330
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,030
And Yuri is?

331
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,616
She was a member of the circle

332
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,410
who committed suicide last year.

333
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,832
The other day, I showed her parents
the designs she made.

334
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,500
And I found that
the design we're working on,

335
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,127
which Shiraishi supposedly came up with,

336
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,713
was the same!

337
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,925
When I pressed him about it,

338
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,636
he readily admitted to
stealing Yuri's designs

339
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,805
for the designs he had made until now.

340
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,640
Not only that...

341
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,103
She committed suicide
just because of some figurines.

342
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,021
What a stupid woman.

343
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,817
Yuri had looked up to Shiraishi,

344
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,610
who regularly participated in design contests,

345
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,737
since her high school days.

346
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:19,825
She was delighted to have been
in the same circle as him.

347
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,202
He used those genuine feelings against her

348
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,829
and betrayed her,

349
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,331
so she despaired and killed herself!

350
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,001
So that's why I...

351
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,504
Spare the details until
we're at the police station.

352
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
Wait a moment.

353
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,716
Dr. Agasa?

354
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:40,012
I heard the details from Conan.

355
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:45,809
Mizuhara was the one who set up
and caused the fire, correct?

356
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:51,315
But the others would have been able
to help Shiraishi right away.

357
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,320
After all, Mizuhara's setup had failed to work.

358
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,614
Officer Takagi,

359
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,408
where's the thinner bottle
that was used to set up the fire?

360
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,702
It fell in a corner of the room.

361
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,207
That is evidence that
the setup did not work as planned.

362
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,625
Pardon?

363
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,835
Think about it carefully.

364
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,421
If the setup had worked,

365
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,341
the thinner bottle would hang from the door,

366
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,927
and the nylon thread would
eventually burn up, making the bottle fall.

367
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,221
You would have found
the bottle near the door.

368
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:27,100
Perhaps the force of the exploding plastic bottle
was so strong

369
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,937
the thinner bottle with the nylon thread

370
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,105
was blown away by the impact.

371
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,523
I see.

372
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,319
But it is still true that the door was locked.

373
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,908
These two realised
what Mizuhara was planning to do

374
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,621
as well as the fact that
the plan was highly likely to fail.

375
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,208
So, when the first explosion occurred

376
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,126
and the lights went out,

377
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,505
they stopped Conan,
who was on his way to help.

378
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,800
They then waited for the second explosion.

379
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,929
But just as they had feared,
the setup didn't work as expected,

380
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,932
and they had to stop Shiraishi,
who was trying to escape.

381
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,308
Shiraishi!

382
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,435
Shiraishi, are you okay?

383
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,312
Shiraishi!

384
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,106
- Aoki, open the door!
- Seriously, the door's locked!

385
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,317
Shiraishi, unlock the door! Shiraishi!

386
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,112
Mizuhara! Bring the door key here!

387
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,326
You guys...

388
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:31,206
We heard that you fought with Shiraishi.

389
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,916
Yes, that's right.

390
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,836
She was the one
who came up with this design.

391
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,213
Shiraishi, you...

392
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:43,510
Besides, Yuri also showed us her design once.

393
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,137
That was when...

394
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,141
Yes, it kind of resembles Shiraishi's design.

395
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,018
You can't do that, Yuri.

396
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,603
You have to bring out
more of your own individuality.

397
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,732
That's right. You shouldn't just try
to copy what Shiraishi had done.

398
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,403
Even though we didn't know it at that time,

399
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,530
we had hurt Yuri's feelings.

400
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,034
It could be that because of us, Yuri...

403
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,010
First, we have to find out about the lovers.

404
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:56,101
Is that so? If that is the case,
we'll give our extensive support.

405

The company I worked at
went bankrupt all of a sudden.

406
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,941
My sister was followed by a stalker.

407
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,319
You've had a streak of terrible luck.

408
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,029

"Vegetables"

413
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,516
Let's eat vegetables every day!

414
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,018
- Don't leave that out, either!
- What does "that" mean?

415
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,728
I'm talking about soup.
