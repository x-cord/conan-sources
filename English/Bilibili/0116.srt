1
00:00:01,108 --> 00:00:04,398
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:06,338
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:09,848
Today's an author mystery!
Some mysteries exist outside of writing!

4
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:11,808
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,858
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,268
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:58,621
The Mystery Writer
Disappearance Case (Part 1).

8
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:19,141
I, Matsuda Samonji, have solved
tonight's bloody string of murders!

9
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,711
That person is undoubtedly the killer!

10
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,151
Detective Samonji
That person is undoubtedly the killer!

11
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:34,201
The son! The son! The son did it!

12
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:39,161
That's dumb! The son is a fake!
It's the wife of the murdered man!

13
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:42,621
Who do you think did it,
Conan-kun?

14
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,591
I'll say the same person as you!

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,301
See! Even he thinks so!

16
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:54,541
How would he know?
Kids don't know anything!

17
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,541
The killer...

18
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:03,401
...is you, his son!

19
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,101
I knew it!

20
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,331
That's impossible!

21
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,401
It was different the last time I saw it...

22
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:13,251
The Detective Samonji
series is always being remade,

23
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:16,371
and the killer changes each time!

24
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:19,331
That's why it's always so interesting!

25
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,001
You blockhead!

26
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:28,591
What was that for?!
Don't make me mad!

27
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,581
That's not mad!

28
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,371
What are you doing, Dad?!

29
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,931
Quick-draw detective,
my butt! How pathetic!

30
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:42,081
Turn it back! Samonji's about to
pull out his sword and say a haiku!

31
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,171
Too bad!

32
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:49,111
Come on! Turn it back!
It's going to end!

33
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,461
Things sure are peaceful for
father and daughter to argue over this...

34
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:59,121
So many people have fallen
victim to their organization.

35
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:03,081
But nobody realizes it's
the organization's fault.

36
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:06,041
If I want to be normal again,

37
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:11,001
I have to turn this bumbling
detective into a real master detective

38
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:16,971
and obtain information on the
men in black's organization!

39
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:22,931
If he gets more work, I'll eventually
run into a case involving them!

40
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:29,361
If I continue to seek
the truth, I know I can do it!

41
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:32,321
Now it's over!

42
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:39,031
What's so good about it anyway?
He's just a third-rate detective.

43
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:44,121
So says the dimwitted detective...

44
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:48,121
Besides, the original
series ended long ago.

45
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,921
It's annoying that
they keep putting it on TV.

46
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,671
Oh, they started the serials again!

47
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,621
Let's see. I'm sure it's around here.

48
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,921
Literature Era started it two months ago.

49
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,601
See!

50
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:08,561
"Shinmei Nintaro's highly
anticipated 'Detective Samonji' returns!"

51
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:11,821
Seriously?!

52
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:15,041
This takes me back!

53
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,081
He and a killer disappeared
into a fire ten years ago,

54
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,071
but I guess he survived!

55
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,031
It takes you back?

56
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:26,001
That's what Shinichi-niichan
said on the phone the other day...

57
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,291
Shinichi did?

58
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,961
That mystery nerd, huh...

59
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,561
Oh? I think someone's
at your office downstairs...

60
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,481
Yeah, tell them it's late
and to come back tomorrow.

61
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:49,901
Okay.

62
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,991
I'm sorry! The office is closed for the day!

63
00:05:57,251 --> 00:06:00,661
But I really do need to talk
to Detective Mori about something.

64
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,911
Could he at least hear what I have to say?

65
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:09,121
Hottie!

66
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,251
It's rather late, so could
you come back tomorrow?

67
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,941
Wait, wait, wait!

68
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,761
What are you saying to our guest?!

69
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:24,431
Sorry to keep you waiting!
I am Mori Kogoro!

70
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,351
I apologize for my rude daughter!

71
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:31,001
Please! Come right in!

72
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:31,831
Thank you.

73
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,561
Right this way!

74
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,941
What's with that attitude?
You told me to turn her away!

75
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,461
Please, have a seat!

76
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,171
My apologies! Go right ahead!

77
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:50,711
Thank you.

78
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,231
It's nothing special, but...

79
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:01,051
Thanks.

80
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:08,021
Now, then.
May I ask what brings you here?

81
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:10,811
Yes. My name is Shinmei Kaori.

82
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:13,271
Yes. My name is Shinmei Kaori.
Shinmei Kaori

83
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,741
Shinmei? You don't mean--?!

84
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,191
The mystery writer's--?

85
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:20,741
Yes. Shinmei Nintaro is my father.
Shinmei Kaori (22), office worker

86
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,651
Yes. Shinmei Nintaro is my father.

87
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:25,281
You're the daughter
of that great master?!

88
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,001
I can never get enough of
Samonji's haikus!

89
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:31,961
Right?!

90
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:38,421
So, how can I help you?
Does he want to use me in a novel?

91
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:44,891
No, actually... my father
has been missing for two months.

92
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,051
He's...

93
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:46,851
...missing?!

94
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,621
That is quite--

95
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,501
Don't be silly!

96
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:55,811
He's been writing serials for
Literature Era for the past two months!

97
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:59,781
But it's the truth! He and my mother
disappeared from their home!

98
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,191
Y-Your mother, too?

99
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:13,711
They both vanished about one
week before this serialization began.

100
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,711
I checked with all our relatives
and acquaintances of course,

101
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,171
but no one knew anything.

102
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:24,091
Still, don't his serials mean
that he is writing manuscripts?

103
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,091
Yes.

104
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:32,181
Oddly enough, the manuscripts
are faxed to the editing department.

105
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,971
Every Saturday, at exactly midnight.

106
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:46,201
But don't the faxes have the
sender's phone number or anything?

107
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,671
No, nothing at all.

108
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:52,161
It seems the sender has it configured
not to display those things.

109
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:53,671
Hmm...

110
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:58,881
It's probably because he and
his wife are on vacation somewhere

111
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:01,961
and he sends the faxes
from the hotel they're staying at!

112
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:04,841
I thought so too at first!

113
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:11,581
But they've never been
quiet for two months like this before!

114
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,521
I can only think that something happened!

115
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,061
Did you contact the police?

116
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:20,371
Yes.

117
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:25,171
I asked them to investigate,
but there had been no ransom calls

118
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:29,031
and the manuscripts were
being sent, so they said not to worry.

119
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:34,631
I tried the other detective agencies,
but they all said the same thing.

120
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:42,541
You're my last hope, Mori-san!

121
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:46,201
This is pointless!

122
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,721
We're only wasting time by sitting here!

123
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:55,991
Let's check the editing department
where his manuscripts get sent!

124
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:58,941
You can save your
troubles for after that!

125
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,401
R-Right!

126
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,991
Taxi!

127
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,161
After you!

128
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,571
Yes, Shinmei-sensei's manuscripts get sent here every week.

129
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:29,421
Daigakukan
Yes, Shinmei-sensei's manuscripts get sent here every week.

130
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:35,071
More should be sent today,
at any time now...

131
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:39,351
Are these manuscripts
really written by him?

132
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:44,951
Yes. Although they're typed out,
the words are most definitely his!

133
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:49,361
He signs his name next
to the title each time, too.

134
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:52,951
I can show you the faxed
manuscripts, if you'd like.

135
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:57,911
Halves at the Top

136
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,871
The title is "Halves at the Top"?

137
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:04,881
And he's signed them, too.

138
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:11,821
Are you certain this is his signature?

139
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:15,761
Yes. We confirmed it
when I came here earlier.

140
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,371
There's nothing
to worry about, Kaori-san!

141
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:25,121
I'm sure he's just so focused
on writing that he forgot to contact you.

142
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:28,481
The same thing happens
to lots of other writers!

143
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:35,161
But are you sure he forgot?
His wife's with him...

144
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:39,121
Yeah, now that you mention it...

145
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:43,451
Did he seem different in any way?

146
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,741
Different?

147
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:47,591
You know, like during
a meeting or something.

148
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:53,201
Yes, we had a simple meeting
before we started the serials,

149
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:57,051
but he didn't seem any different...

150
00:11:57,321 --> 00:12:02,281
Anything at all?
Even the tiniest thing might help...

151
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:09,571
I suppose there is the fact he
restarted his Detective Samonji series.

152
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:10,531
Huh?

153
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:16,781
You see, I have been asking him
to restart this series for the past four years.

154
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,661
But he always answered by saying...

155
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:24,951
Samonji is dead.
There's no bringing him back.

156
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:30,551
So I had half given up when
he suddenly called two months ago

157
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:37,031
to ask if we could make
room for his new Samonji series.

158
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:41,951
We were more than
happy to oblige, of course,

159
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,951
so we hurriedly canceled
the new series we were running

160
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,941
and replaced it with Samonji.

161
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:49,651
I see. Anything else?

162
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:56,661
Oh, come to think of it,
this doesn't pertain to him exactly,

163
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:59,571
but for the dedication, he wrote this:

164
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:03,371
"Attention, all master
detectives throughout Japan!

165
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:09,631
If you wish to surpass my intellect,
solve this case's true mystery."

166
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:12,551
That's quite a provocative dedication.

167
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:16,951
Yes. And ever since the
first chapter, we've received

168
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:21,511
tons of calls and fan letters saying,
"This is how it was done!"

169
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,821
As an editor, it makes me happy,

170
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:28,851
but it seemed like a rare move
for such a mild-mannered writer.

171
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:34,161
Though, fans have been waiting
like crazy for over ten years,

172
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,571
so it's only natural he's
getting such a big reception.

173
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:39,161
"Like crazy"?

174
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:43,701
Yes, there was even a scary
call last year from a crazed fan

175
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:49,081
who threatened to set this place
on fire if he didn't restart the series!

176
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:52,461
Talk about extreme...

177
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:56,921
Oh, yes! There's one
other thing that seemed strange!

178
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:59,871
He appears in his own novel!

179
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:00,891
Come again?

180
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:07,161
Shinmei-sensei appears in the story,
as an old friend of Samonji's!

181
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:10,901
He's a struggling
writer who resides in France.

182
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,861
There are about forty stories in
the series, but this is a first!

183
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:21,621
I think it's going to end
with all the previous cases

184
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:24,621
being things Samonji told him about!

185
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:28,581
Kind of like how
Watson is to Sherlock Holmes!

186
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,541
Say! Could you show me that scene?

187
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,281
Sure!

188
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,281
But can you read kanji, little boy?

189
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:41,801
A little!

190
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:47,221
Oh, you're right! Here he is!

191
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,451
Shinmei-sensei makes his first appearance

192
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:56,821
when Samonji calls a friend living
in France for advice on a case.

193
00:14:56,821 --> 00:15:00,161
His character is absentminded and funny!

194
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,741
W-What's this?!

195
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,365
This is strange!

196
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,825
Look at this!

197
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:17,665
10:00 is written in kanji here,
but 1:00 is written with a number!

198
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:22,655
This guy must've been pretty tired, huh?

199
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:28,055
That is strange. Could this actually be...

200
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:32,405
...a misprint on your part?

201
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:33,515
No!

202
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:38,815
We wanted to fix it to
make it easier to read, too!

203
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:44,275
But he said, "The lay of the letters
is a novel's life! Don't change it!"

204
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,945
He said it many times before the serialization.

205
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:54,575
He also said he'd cancel the
series immediately if we defied his wish.

206
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:58,065
Then that makes it all the odder.

207
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:02,545
It's almost as if something
is being hidden in the writing.

208
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:07,465
And then there are
Shinmei-sensei's signatures.

209
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:13,425
If my theory is correct,
it's possible that he's already...

210
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:18,895
Oh! Here's his latest fax!

211
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,815
Let's see here...

212
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:27,065
You can't look yet!

213
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:32,365
It's a mystery story!
Wait until it's in book form to read it!

214
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,035
Hey!

215
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:39,705
I thought so!

216
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,155
Hey, you!

217
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:45,835
But his signature is weird!

218
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:49,255
Chapters six through eight match perfectly.

219
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:54,175
Nintaro

220
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,135
Th-They do!

221
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:01,855
Chapters one through six are all
slightly different, though. I wonder why!

222
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:05,815
He obviously just
copied an earlier signature.

223
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:08,025
Why would he do that?

224
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,735
Because he didn't
want to write it anymore...

225
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,695
...or he couldn't anymore?

226
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:15,445
Mori-san!

227
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:17,205
If he can't write anymore,

228
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:22,375
that means Shinmei-sensei
might already be dead, doesn't it?

229
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:24,165
Y-You can't be serious!

230
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:28,625
This is bad! This
requires immediate action!

231
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,815
You! The police! Call the police!

232
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:32,505
Right!

233
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:39,935
It's not 100% yet!
There's a chance he's still alive!

234
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:46,605
The key to saving his life is
probably hidden inside this novel!

235
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,835
As a message he's left for us detectives!

236
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,115
Daigakukan

237
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,075
You can't open an investigation?

238
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:01,995
No, we still can't. Not at this stage.

239
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,955
Hold on, Inspector!

240
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:10,815
Shinmei Nintaro,
her father and a mystery writer,

241
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,925
has been missing for two months now!

242
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:18,065
What's more, his wife is also gone!

243
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:22,395
I can only think they got
caught up in some sort of incident!

244
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:30,355
Even so, his manuscripts are
being faxed here every single week.

245
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:35,565
Even though they're faxes,

246
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:41,325
his daughter and the editors
all agree it's his writing!

247
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:47,115
And like I said, those
faxes are the issue here!

248
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:49,505
Don't those signatures
seem strange to you?!

249
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:54,965
Signatures? But they were
already confirmed to be his.

250
00:18:55,315 --> 00:19:03,275
Between Chapter one and six,
his signatures are all slightly different,

251
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,935
but between Chapter six and eight,
they're all exactly the same!

252
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:11,275
They're obviously copies
of a previous signature

253
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,985
and evidence that he's now in
a condition in which he can't write!

254
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:19,945
In other words,
something has happened to him!

255
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:25,405
Then tell me...
Who did what to Mr. Shinmei?

256
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:30,235
I'd believe you more if there
was a threatening phone call,

257
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,875
but there's been nothing at all.

258
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:38,845
Besides, maybe he got sick of
signing them and used copies instead.

259
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:44,305
True. Given the circumstances,
Inspector Megure is right.

260
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:49,155
It wouldn't be surprising
for an eccentric writer

261
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:54,275
to take his wife and hole up
somewhere to focus on his writing.

262
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:56,615
But something bugs me!

263
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:57,265
Attention, all master detectives throughout
Japan!
But something bugs me!

264
00:19:57,265 --> 00:20:00,235
It wasn't like him to write that dedication.
Attention, all master detectives throughout
Japan!

265
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:00,775
Attention, all master detectives throughout
Japan!

266
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:06,165
It was very extreme and provocative
for someone so mild-mannered.
Attention, all master detectives throughout
Japan!

267
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:11,955
Then, there's the fact the writer
suddenly appears in the series.

268
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:16,195
And then there's his odd dialogue

269
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:20,975
that mixes numbers, kanji
numbers, and English letters...

270
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,195
If my theory is correct,

271
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:29,565
there must be a message
from Shinmei-sensei in here!

272
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:37,155
Inspector! I made copies of all
the lines Mori-san was curious about.

273
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,495
Mr. Shinmei makes
four appearances so far?

274
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,955
Can I have a copy, too?

275
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,915
Stop that! Don't get in the way!

276
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,115
It's okay! There are extras!

277
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:52,925
Here you go!

278
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:53,875
Thank you!

279
00:20:54,115 --> 00:21:00,115
Let's see, his first appearance
is when the main detective character

280
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:03,845
calls Mr. Shinmei,
who is residing in France.

281
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,305
He's also in France the second time...

282
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:11,435
He's in France the third time...

283
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:14,145
And the fourth time, too.

284
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,445
Does Mr. Shinmei like France?

285
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,615
Yes. He and my mother
often traveled there.

286
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:27,695
Damn! Reading them backwards
or rearranging them doesn't work!

287
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:30,625
If only I had a point to start from!

288
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:37,115
Umm, do you mind if we use
Chapter eight of "Halves at the Top,"

289
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:38,545
the manuscript he just faxed?

290
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:40,755
Halves at the top?

291
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:45,595
It's the title of the work
you're reading right now!

292
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,155
Halves at the--?

293
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:51,815
Halves at the top?!

294
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,485
Hold on, now!
Could this actually be--?!

295
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,905
T-This is--!

296
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,275
Just as I thought!

297
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,865
There's a message from
Shinmei-sensei hidden in these lines!

298
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:17,275
Which makes it all fit:
that provocative dedication,

299
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:20,905
the author's appearance in the story,
and the odd lines of dialogue!

300
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:29,035
But what is the goal of the person
holding him and his wife captive?!

301
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,255
Inspector!

302
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:07,395
What is it, Takagi-kun?

303
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:10,015
Look at this manuscript!
There's more dialogue!

304
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:15,975
Huh? This is the eighth
chapter that was just faxed here?

305
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:17,645
"Hurry..."

306
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,395
"There's..."

307
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:21,065
"...no time..."

308
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,525
"Hurry, there's no time!"

309
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,645
On the next Conan--

310
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:33,285
"The Mystery Writer
Disappearance Case (Part 2)."
