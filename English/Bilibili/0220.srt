1
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.032
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:22.732
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:24.532
A beautiful and mysterious lady makes an appearance in today's episode.

4
00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:26.532
An odd request is the entrance to the case.

5
00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:27.932
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:29.532
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:31.932
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57.068 --> 00:02:02.568
"A Client Full of Lies (Part 1)"

9
00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:06.068
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:09.768
You say, you're looking for someone?

11
00:02:09.768 --> 00:02:12.768
Yes. There is a person that I really want to see.

12
00:02:12.768 --> 00:02:16.368
Well, I'm so sorry, but I happen to be tied up just now.

13
00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:19.068
Please, will you help me, please?

14
00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:22.568
To tell you the truth, I'm right near your office already.

15
00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:23.668
If it's okay with you,

16
00:02:23.668 --> 00:02:26.068
I'd like to at least be given a chance to talk to you.

17
00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:29.868
The winner is, Kaminari-Boy!

18
00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:32.268
He has won the final race with his graceful legs!

19
00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:35.368
Oh no... I lost again.

20
00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:37.368
Hello, Mr. Mouri?

21
00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:39.068
Didn't I already tell you that today I'm...

22
00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:46.468
Yes, I guess it won't hurt to hear you out.

23
00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:48.268
I'll be waiting for you.

24
00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:52.768
Come on, do your job.

25
00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:54.068
Dad!

26
00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:56.568
I know.

27
00:02:56.568 --> 00:02:59.868
What kind of person was the caller?

28
00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:01.668
Some middle aged lady.

29
00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:03.768
She says she's coming over right now.

30
00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:05.968
I'll bet she is one of those,

31
00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:10.368
"Please, please help me find my first love," type client anyway.

32
00:03:10.368 --> 00:03:12.868
I just know it.

33
00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:16.368
Please come in!

34
00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:27.668
I called just a while ago. My name is Ikenami.

35
00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:31.168
Please forgive me for intruding on you so suddenly like this.

36
00:03:31.168 --> 00:03:34.768
"Shizuka Ikenami" -An acquaintance of mine mentioned that you, Mr. Mouri

37
00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:37.468
"Client" -would definitely find the person that I'm looking for.

38
00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:39.468
Please help me.

39
00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:41.368
Please come this way.

40
00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.668
Talk about beautiful.

41
00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:47.368
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:50.168
Where did dad go?

43
00:03:52.668 --> 00:03:57.068
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, mademoiselle.

44
00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:04.368
I was looking through some papers of a very difficult case, you see.

45
00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:08.168
Come now, and relax on the sofa,

46
00:04:08.168 --> 00:04:09.868
and calm that pulsating heart of yours

47
00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:12.768
before I hear you out.

48
00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:15.668
Ran. Get us something to drink.

49
00:04:15.668 --> 00:04:17.568
Okay.

50
00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:20.168
Here he goes again.

51
00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:23.168
"Mouri Detective Agency"

52
00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:26.468
You're looking for a Jr. High School classmate?

53
00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:29.768
Yes, we belonged to the same kendo club.

54
00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:34.068
Couldn't you find his address on the graduation list?

55
00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:37.168
He moved before graduation,

56
00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:39.268
and the space where his name is supposed to be is blank.

57
00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:42.268
He... I see...

58
00:04:42.268 --> 00:04:45.068
I've brought a picture of him back in those days with me here.

59
00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:51.668
He's the one in the center holding the winner's cup.

60
00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:53.768
His name is Shiro Shibata.

61
00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:57.468
Isn't the girl standing next to him?

62
00:04:57.468 --> 00:05:00.868
How embarrassing, but it's me.

63
00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:04.068
It's already been 30 years though.

64
00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:05.968
Thirty years ago?

65
00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:08.268
Don't tell me that you're already over 40?

66
00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:11.168
Yes, I will be 42 this year.

67
00:05:11.168 --> 00:05:15.168
But, the boy in the picture is still in 8th grade.

68
00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:18.268
Although I think he may have grown taller by now.

69
00:05:18.268 --> 00:05:21.268
Any hobbies?

70
00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:24.668
Oh, yes... I don't think he has any special hobbies though.

71
00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:26.568
No, I mean yours.

72
00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:34.368
I like knitting, and I usually knit sweaters.

73
00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.968
My, what a nice hobby.

74
00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:39.868
Oh, my mother's hobby is knitting too.

75
00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:40.968
My.

76
00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:43.668
I'll bet you're good at cooking too?

77
00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:46.468
No, not at all.

78
00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:49.468
See, I cut myself in three places

79
00:05:49.468 --> 00:05:50.668
when I tried to cook after a long while last night.

80
00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:53.168
Oh well, no big deal.

81
00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:55.968
Shortcomings help make a person more attractive at times.

82
00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:59.068
Right, right, just like mother.

83
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.468
But I'm full of shortcomings.

84
00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:07.668
That's why I'm still single at this age.

85
00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.968
-What? You're single? -Yes.

86
00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:15.768
Well, to leave a beauty like you single,

87
00:06:15.768 --> 00:06:18.868
the guys around you must be blind.

88
00:06:18.868 --> 00:06:21.268
Really, what a fantastic person.

89
00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:22.668
Just like mother,

90
00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:25.568
it's hard to understand the guy who doesn't give a hoot about her.

91
00:06:25.568 --> 00:06:26.768
Ran.

92
00:06:29.468 --> 00:06:30.768
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:34.768
What's wrong? Do you have a cold?

94
00:06:34.768 --> 00:06:38.268
Oh, no... I was born with bronchial problems.

95
00:06:38.268 --> 00:06:40.468
I'm allergic to dust.

96
00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:42.168
I'm sorry,

97
00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:44.668
it must be dusty here because we were cleaning till just a while ago.

98
00:06:44.668 --> 00:06:47.468
Let's change places then.

99
00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:49.368
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:54.768
"Cafe Poirot"

101
00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:56.268
Picture?

102
00:06:56.268 --> 00:06:59.168
So, you're looking for this Mr. Shibata

103
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:02.468
because you want to get a picture back from him?

104
00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:03.568
Yes.

105
00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:04.968
It's only one picture that was taken

106
00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:08.668
when we won the semi-finals in a summer contest

107
00:07:08.668 --> 00:07:11.668
during our Jr. High School days.

108
00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:12.868
Just the other day,

109
00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:15.068
my grandmother seems to have mistakenly thrown away

110
00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:17.268
the plate we received then.

111
00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:20.668
So, I thought that I'd like to at least have a picture of it.

112
00:07:20.668 --> 00:07:24.368
But, why does Mr. Shibata have that picture?

113
00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:26.068
I was using that picture

114
00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:28.368
as a bookmarker for a book that I borrowed from him,

115
00:07:28.368 --> 00:07:31.768
but I forgot to take the picture out of the book when I returned it to him.

116
00:07:31.768 --> 00:07:36.168
Then, Mr. Shibata is not your first love or anything like that?

117
00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:39.968
No... well...

118
00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:43.768
And, do you have any other clues on him?

119
00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:45.568
Well...

120
00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:47.268
Mr. Mouri, may I take your order?

121
00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:49.468
Coffee for me.

122
00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.068
I'll have iced lemon tea.

123
00:07:51.068 --> 00:07:52.568
I...

124
00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:53.668
Reiko.

125
00:07:54.768 --> 00:07:57.368
Reiko? Who is she?

126
00:07:57.368 --> 00:08:01.968
Oh no... he used to call me by that name.

127
00:08:01.968 --> 00:08:05.168
Something about the character called Reiko,

128
00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:09.668
in the book that I borrowed from him resembled me.

129
00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:11.668
What would you like, Conan?

130
00:08:11.668 --> 00:08:13.168
Ice coffee for me.

131
00:08:13.168 --> 00:08:15.268
I'll take the same.

132
00:08:15.268 --> 00:08:16.568
All right.

133
00:08:17.568 --> 00:08:20.868
So, where should I start.

134
00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:23.268
The only clues I have are his name,

135
00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:27.468
age and this picture of 30 years ago.

136
00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:34.268
-You know what... -Then, what about asking him for help?

137
00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:35.368
Him?

138
00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:38.968
I've heard rumors about him.

139
00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:40.968
Also that the high school detective,

140
00:08:40.968 --> 00:08:45.968
Shinichi Kudo is in and out of your office at times.

141
00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:49.468
Shinichi?

142
00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:52.268
Isn't that right, son?

143
00:08:52.268 --> 00:08:54.868
No, he hasn't come around at all that brat.

144
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.168
He only rings me up once in a while to say stupid things.

145
00:08:58.168 --> 00:09:01.468
Well, I'm sorry that I only have stupid things to say.

146
00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.468
What a bummer

147
00:09:03.468 --> 00:09:05.768
to have such rumors going around.

148
00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:10.668
If worse comes to worse, they may hear about it too.

149
00:09:12.268 --> 00:09:15.368
I'll have to keep my deductions to myself for a while, I guess...

150
00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.468
Conan.

151
00:09:18.468 --> 00:09:20.568
What do you think, Conan?

152
00:09:21.768 --> 00:09:24.068
Well, you were about to say something just now, weren't you?

153
00:09:24.068 --> 00:09:27.168
What good is it going to do, asking a brat?

154
00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:31.068
But, he always takes note of interesting things, doesn't he?

155
00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:32.268
Oh, no, it's nothing.

156
00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:35.068
Something just happened to cross my mind.

157
00:09:35.068 --> 00:09:38.168
Since he's holding the trophy,

158
00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:40.468
this man won the tournament, right?

159
00:09:40.468 --> 00:09:41.568
Yes.

160
00:09:41.568 --> 00:09:43.368
If he was that strong when he was in the 8th grade,

161
00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:45.068
I just thought even now...

162
00:09:45.068 --> 00:09:49.368
he must be participating in some tournament.

163
00:09:51.968 --> 00:09:54.068
Oh, but I just thought maybe...

164
00:09:56.468 --> 00:09:58.668
What? He's participating?

165
00:09:58.668 --> 00:09:59.868
In the Shizuoka Tournament,

166
00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:02.468
among the general contestants, Mr. Shiro Shibata?

167
00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:05.568
Yes. Yes!

168
00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:08.268
Did you find him?

169
00:10:08.268 --> 00:10:12.768
Yeah. He seems to be a regular who always appears in the top ranks.

170
00:10:12.768 --> 00:10:16.868
He seems to be working as a high school P.E. teacher in Shizuoka.

171
00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:21.168
And is presently residing with his wife in a condominium.

172
00:10:21.168 --> 00:10:24.268
I'll go rent a car right now.

173
00:10:25.268 --> 00:10:27.568
I'm glad you found him.

174
00:10:27.568 --> 00:10:29.468
Yes, really.

175
00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:32.868
He's been found.

176
00:10:32.868 --> 00:10:36.368
The one she's looking for has been found, but...

177
00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:40.968
what I can't make out is this lady who is full of lies.

178
00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:45.068
Almost everything she says is a lie.

179
00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:48.468
I wonder what she is up to.

180
00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:54.768
Could it be that she's hiding her identity?

181
00:10:54.768 --> 00:10:56.568
Hey, hey, come on.

182
00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:58.168
Don't tell me that this lady is...

183
00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:03.568
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

184
00:11:13.668 --> 00:11:17.268
"Shibata"

185
00:11:17.268 --> 00:11:18.668
Nobody seems to be home.

186
00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:21.768
I'm sure the couple has gone out together,

187
00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:23.668
because today is Sunday.

188
00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:27.868
Why don't we go kill time somewhere nearby, then?

189
00:11:27.868 --> 00:11:28.968
Wait.

190
00:11:29.968 --> 00:11:31.868
"Takezo Yoshikawa (47)" -Are you by chance...

191
00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.968
"Shiro Shibata's friend" -looking for Mr. Shibata?

192
00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:35.968
Yes, sort of.

193
00:11:37.168 --> 00:11:39.568
Please finish what you have to do as soon as possible,

194
00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:43.468
because he promised to play mahjong together today at my house.

195
00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:45.968
But he doesn't seem to be in.

196
00:11:45.968 --> 00:11:48.068
It can't be.

197
00:11:48.068 --> 00:11:49.868
I'm sure he's asleep or something.

198
00:11:52.368 --> 00:11:54.268
See, he's home.

199
00:11:55.268 --> 00:11:56.568
This program is brought to you

200
00:11:56.568 --> 00:12:00.168
-by the following companies. -It's the sound of the TV.

201
00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:04.668
Come on, dozing off with the TV on without even locking the door.

202
00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:06.068
Hey, Shibata!

203
00:12:06.068 --> 00:12:07.768
We're going to start pretty soon!

204
00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:14.668
Hey, hey, it looks like he was still eating?

205
00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:19.868
The soup is cold...

206
00:12:19.868 --> 00:12:21.368
The rice is all dried up and hard.

207
00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:22.568
This couldn't be his breakfast.

208
00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:25.568
What a waste, the "guji" looks so good.

209
00:12:25.568 --> 00:12:27.368
Guji?

210
00:12:27.368 --> 00:12:29.168
I mean tilefish.

211
00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.768
I'm back. Dear?

212
00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:40.268
Hey, who are all of you?

213
00:12:40.268 --> 00:12:42.968
"Kyoko Shibara (38), Mrs. Shibata" -Why are you in my house?

214
00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:44.968
I'm going to call the police.

215
00:12:44.968 --> 00:12:47.268
-Well, you see... -We are...

216
00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:50.068
Hey, Shibata? What's the matter?

217
00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:51.468
Get a hold of yourself. Hey.

218
00:12:51.468 --> 00:12:53.168
What's happened to you?

219
00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:55.868
Mr. Shibata!

220
00:12:55.868 --> 00:12:58.768
Mr. Shibata, get a hold of yourself.

221
00:13:00.068 --> 00:13:01.668
Mr. Shibata!

222
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:06.568
He is holding something in his right hand?

223
00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:07.968
What is it?

224
00:13:12.768 --> 00:13:15.068
This is...

225
00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:28.976
So, let me verify what you said.

226
00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:33.176
Mr. Mouri and his party came over to Mr. Shibata's house

227
00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:35.676
and pushed the button of the interphone,

228
00:13:35.676 --> 00:13:37.576
but there was no answer.

229
00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:42.776
Just then, Mr. Yoshikawa who had a previous engagement with came along

230
00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:44.276
and tried turning the knob of the door.

231
00:13:44.276 --> 00:13:46.876
The door was unlocked,

232
00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:50.276
so the five of you came into the room.

233
00:13:50.276 --> 00:13:53.476
Then, Mrs. Shibata, Mr. Shibata's wife,

234
00:13:53.476 --> 00:13:55.376
who had been out comes back

235
00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:57.676
and runs into Mr. Mouri and the others.

236
00:13:57.676 --> 00:14:00.776
After that, upon hearing Mr. Yoshikawa shout,

237
00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:03.276
you all go to the living room to check things out

238
00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:08.676
and found Mr. Shibata bleeding from the head and dead.

239
00:14:08.676 --> 00:14:10.176
Yeah.

240
00:14:10.176 --> 00:14:16.076
The estimated time of death is between dawn and morning today.

241
00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:18.176
All right.

242
00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:20.876
Where were you around that time, Mrs. Shibata?

243
00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:21.976
Yes.

244
00:14:21.976 --> 00:14:25.276
I had a golf date with a friend of mine today,

245
00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:29.376
and my friend came to pick me up.

246
00:14:29.376 --> 00:14:32.276
So, I prepared my husband's lunch,

247
00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:34.576
and left the house before 05:00 am.

248
00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:39.476
Was Mr. Shibata at home then?

249
00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:44.376
Yes, he came home about 03:00 am and was fast asleep.

250
00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:46.776
He came home at 03:00 am?

251
00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:47.976
Yes.

252
00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:49.776
We were playing mahjong.

253
00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:51.776
We were playing mahjong at my room

254
00:14:51.776 --> 00:14:53.476
that is on the fourth floor.

255
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.876
Just as Mrs. Shibata says,

256
00:14:54.876 --> 00:14:57.376
we finished the game around 03:00 am.

257
00:14:58.476 --> 00:15:02.376
As a matter of fact, the morning paper was one the table,

258
00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:05.176
about what time is the newspaper delivered?

259
00:15:05.176 --> 00:15:08.176
It comes about 06:00 am

260
00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:10.376
and is put inside the mailbox right outside the front door.

261
00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:13.576
I see, which means that Mr. Shibata,

262
00:15:13.576 --> 00:15:15.476
got up in the morning,

263
00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:17.776
pulled the newspaper out of the mailbox,

264
00:15:17.776 --> 00:15:20.076
and was in the middle of eating his breakfast,

265
00:15:20.076 --> 00:15:22.476
when someone who came to the door killed him.

266
00:15:22.476 --> 00:15:24.776
I guess that's what happened.

267
00:15:24.776 --> 00:15:28.176
How can you tell that it was when he was eating?

268
00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:31.076
The food on the table is half eaten,

269
00:15:31.076 --> 00:15:33.876
and besides, it's cold and dried up.

270
00:15:33.876 --> 00:15:37.376
Who did this? Who killed my husband?

271
00:15:37.376 --> 00:15:39.576
Well, I don't know yet.

272
00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:44.976
Mr. Mouri, did you notice anything strange when you entered the room?

273
00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:50.476
Well, I guess the only thing is that the TV in the kitchen was on.

274
00:15:50.476 --> 00:15:52.276
What, the TV?

275
00:15:52.276 --> 00:15:55.376
It was turned off when we got here.

276
00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:58.376
I turned it off because it was noisy.

277
00:15:58.376 --> 00:16:03.176
Besides, I just figured that he was watching TV while eating breakfast.

278
00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:06.276
My husband could've been watching

279
00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:11.476
a samurai show called "Kenyuden" that starts at 08:00 am.

280
00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:16.176
My husband records that program every week

281
00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:18.776
and watches it in the living room.

282
00:16:18.776 --> 00:16:22.776
He sure does have a lot of them.

283
00:16:22.776 --> 00:16:25.476
Okay, go check out the video deck in the kitchen.

284
00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:27.176
Yes, sir.

285
00:16:27.176 --> 00:16:31.476
Why is the LD player gone?

286
00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:35.776
Because he has a lot of LD software

287
00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:37.376
and yet there is no player.

288
00:16:37.376 --> 00:16:40.576
See, this place here on the shelf is empty.

289
00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:44.176
Moreover, there is only one speaker.

290
00:16:44.176 --> 00:16:46.076
True.

291
00:16:46.076 --> 00:16:50.676
Maybe it's out for repair or something, right Mrs. Shibata?

292
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.476
As to that, my husband...

293
00:16:53.476 --> 00:16:56.576
Who cares about that right now?

294
00:16:56.576 --> 00:17:00.076
Hurry up and do what you have to and let me go.

295
00:17:00.076 --> 00:17:02.476
All right, I'm going to verify your alibi

296
00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:05.776
so could you give me the phone number of your friend

297
00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.676
-who you went golfing with? -Sure.

298
00:17:08.676 --> 00:17:10.976
And, I'd like to have the phone numbers of the people

299
00:17:10.976 --> 00:17:13.476
-who play mahjong with you too. -Okay.

300
00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:20.476
She came to pick Mrs. Shibata up at 05:00 am sharp?

301
00:17:20.476 --> 00:17:21.576
Are you sure?

302
00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:25.776
Yes, she says the radio beeped the time at the tone.

303
00:17:25.776 --> 00:17:27.876
And, she says she dropped Mrs. Shibata off here

304
00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:29.276
a little after 07:00 pm.

305
00:17:29.276 --> 00:17:33.676
A little after 07:00 pm is just about the time we got here.

306
00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:36.976
I also check with the newspaper man,

307
00:17:36.976 --> 00:17:40.476
and he said that he delivered the papers here around 06:00 am.

308
00:17:41.676 --> 00:17:45.776
Taking into consideration that the samurai program this morning

309
00:17:45.776 --> 00:17:49.176
was kept recording on the video and the time the program was aired,

310
00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:50.576
the estimated time of the crime

311
00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:54.376
would probably be around 08:00 am to 45 minutes from then.

312
00:17:54.376 --> 00:17:58.176
Which means that Mrs. Shibata couldn't have done it.

313
00:17:58.176 --> 00:17:59.676
No.

314
00:17:59.676 --> 00:18:01.376
Of course not.

315
00:18:01.376 --> 00:18:04.376
Then, let me ask you this, Mr. Yoshikawa,

316
00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.776
I've had my doubts about the way you've been acting till now,

317
00:18:06.776 --> 00:18:08.876
but would you tell me your alibi around 08:00 am this morning?

318
00:18:08.876 --> 00:18:10.976
At home sleeping.

319
00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:13.376
Is there anyone who can verify that?

320
00:18:13.376 --> 00:18:16.576
No, because I live alone.

321
00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:19.876
That's right. I left a message on the answering phone.

322
00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:23.076
I said, "About time you get up, because I'm going to pick you up soon."

323
00:18:23.076 --> 00:18:27.276
A killer wouldn't leave such a message behind, would he?

324
00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:31.276
Or, maybe that's the very reason you left the message?

325
00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.376
Wait a minute,

326
00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:36.276
you seem to be suspecting only me but, what about them?

327
00:18:36.276 --> 00:18:39.276
Although they seem to be an acquaintance of yours or something.

328
00:18:40.776 --> 00:18:44.276
They would never commit a murder.

329
00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:48.176
He is Kogoro Mouri, a detective that I deeply respect.

330
00:18:48.176 --> 00:18:49.176
Thank you.

331
00:18:50.676 --> 00:18:52.676
You mean that famous...

332
00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:55.276
-Sleeping Kogoro! -That's right.

333
00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:58.276
The young lady with him is his daughter Ran.

334
00:18:58.276 --> 00:19:00.576
The little one is staying at his place, and his name is Conan.

335
00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:04.376
And, this beautiful woman here is Mrs. Mouri.

336
00:19:05.576 --> 00:19:07.176
Right, Mr. Mouri?

337
00:19:07.176 --> 00:19:09.776
-Does it look that way? -No way.

338
00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:15.476
My name is Ikenami, and I went over to Mr. Mouri's office

339
00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:17.276
to have him look for Mr. Shiro Shibata

340
00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:19.276
who happened to be an old friend of mine.

341
00:19:19.276 --> 00:19:22.476
I came here because I wanted him to give me back a picture

342
00:19:22.476 --> 00:19:27.576
that I had mistakenly given to him about 30 years ago.

343
00:19:27.576 --> 00:19:29.576
A picture?

344
00:19:29.576 --> 00:19:33.476
That picture is probably the picture that he's holding in his hand.

345
00:19:34.976 --> 00:19:35.976
Hey.

346
00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:38.276
I took a look at it a while ago.

347
00:19:39.376 --> 00:19:40.876
It can't be...

348
00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:42.676
This is...

349
00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:44.776
Don't tell me that this is...

350
00:19:44.776 --> 00:19:46.276
Yes, that's the picture.

351
00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:48.876
That's the picture I was looking for.

352
00:19:51.576 --> 00:19:55.176
Why is Mr. Shibata holding the picture in his hand?

353
00:19:56.376 --> 00:19:59.076
Maybe, Mr. Mouri...

354
00:19:59.076 --> 00:20:04.476
This is his dying message?

355
00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:06.976
It can't be.

356
00:20:06.976 --> 00:20:10.176
Beautiful Shizuka can't possibly be involved in any way.

357
00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:14.176
Besides, this picture was to have been kept between the pages of a book.

358
00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.976
I can't believe that it just happened to conveniently be on the floor

359
00:20:15.976 --> 00:20:17.476
where he was struck to death.

360
00:20:17.476 --> 00:20:22.676
Something is squashed under the stomach of that man.

361
00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:27.176
This is?

362
00:20:28.176 --> 00:20:29.376
A novel?

363
00:20:29.376 --> 00:20:32.876
The title is "The Gate of the God of Thunder".

364
00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:36.776
Don't tell me that this is the book you were talking about?

365
00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:38.576
Yes, it is.

366
00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:43.576
That's the book that I borrowed from Shiro 30 years ago, and read,

367
00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.376
using that picture as a bookmarker.

368
00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:48.176
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

369
00:20:48.176 --> 00:20:50.476
Hey hold it, will you?

370
00:20:50.476 --> 00:20:52.476
Don't you think everything fits in too well?

371
00:20:52.476 --> 00:20:54.476
How can it be that the book as well as the picture

372
00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:57.176
just happened to be lying on the floor, so coincidentally?

373
00:20:57.176 --> 00:20:58.376
Come to think of it,

374
00:20:58.376 --> 00:21:00.776
there was a strange phone call the day before yesterday.

375
00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:02.776
A strange phone call?

376
00:21:02.776 --> 00:21:04.876
Well, Mr. Shibata said,

377
00:21:04.876 --> 00:21:07.476
"Watch the program because it's interesting."

378
00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:11.176
That's why I was watching that samurai movie here in this living room.

379
00:21:11.176 --> 00:21:13.676
Just then, I got a phone call.

380
00:21:13.676 --> 00:21:14.876
Right, Mrs. Shibata?

381
00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:17.776
Yes, the person on the phone asked my husband something.

382
00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.876
He searched for a book, took it from the shelf,

383
00:21:20.876 --> 00:21:24.876
flipped through the pages and grinned while remarking,

384
00:21:24.876 --> 00:21:28.176
"I found it, I found it."

385
00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:32.476
He grinned? And? Where did your husband put that book after that?

386
00:21:32.476 --> 00:21:35.876
I'm sure that he put in on top of the books

387
00:21:35.876 --> 00:21:37.376
that he had piled up in front of the bookshelf.

388
00:21:38.476 --> 00:21:41.076
They are scattered.

389
00:21:41.076 --> 00:21:42.376
Officer Yokomizo.

390
00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:44.476
Although they are very slight, there are blood stains in the corridor.

391
00:21:44.476 --> 00:21:45.476
What?

392
00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:47.776
It seems as though

393
00:21:47.776 --> 00:21:51.076
the real scene of the crime was here in the corridor.

394
00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:56.176
Officer.

395
00:21:56.176 --> 00:21:58.376
Could I take a look at that book?

396
00:21:58.376 --> 00:22:01.176
No, no because it's a very important piece of evidence.

397
00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:04.076
Besides, this is a ninja book full of kanji characters.

398
00:22:04.076 --> 00:22:06.876
You're too young to be reading something like this.

399
00:22:06.876 --> 00:22:09.276
Did you read the book, officer?

400
00:22:09.276 --> 00:22:12.076
Yeah, a long time ago.

401
00:22:12.076 --> 00:22:16.076
Does a person by the name of Reiko come out in that book?

402
00:22:17.076 --> 00:22:20.376
A lady with such a fancy name doesn't appear anywhere in the book.

403
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:21.976
Not again.

404
00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:24.176
Yet another one.

405
00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.976
She's lied again.

406
00:22:28.376 --> 00:22:31.176
What on earth is she up to anyway?

407
00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:35.276
What is there behind all the lies of hers?

408
00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:06.076
"Next Episode" -So, Ms. Ikenami,

409
00:24:06.076 --> 00:24:09.076
please come to the station with me.

410
00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:11.076
I refuse.

411
00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:13.476
So, the killer is...

412
00:24:14.476 --> 00:24:16.276
She was here.

413
00:24:16.276 --> 00:24:18.876
She was here before we got here.

414
00:24:18.876 --> 00:24:21.176
Don't tell me that this is the remains of...

415
00:24:21.176 --> 00:24:24.376
Isn't it about time you tell us

416
00:24:24.376 --> 00:24:27.576
the reason for your four lies?

417
00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.776
Next Conan,

418
00:24:29.776 --> 00:24:33.597
"A Client Full of Lies (Part 2)"

419
00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:36.594
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:36.594 --> 00:24:38.694
"Bandage"

421
00:24:38.694 --> 00:24:42.094
-Next time will show Part 2. -Hey, Conan, her true identity is...

422
00:24:42.094 --> 00:24:43.794
-What? -What?
