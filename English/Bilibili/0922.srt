1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,170
Yaiba Kick!

2
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,070
Masked Yaiba!

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,870
Cut! Okay!

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,970
I was worried since it was raining on and off this morning,

5
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,670
but I'm glad we came to watch the show.

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,470
Yaiba's action is super cool even in the mud.

7
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,370
I know. It's so intense.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,870
"Masaya Tatsumi (26)"

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,070
Hey, what are you doing?

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,670
Don't get angry, Genta.

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,670
As another Yaiba fan,

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,970
I understand his desire to watch from the front.

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,770
Yeah, but...

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,770
Are you worried about him?

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,770
Yeah.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,070
Yaiba...

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,470
I'm not sure what's so interesting,

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,770
but at the very least, he doesn't seem to be a Yaiba fan.

19
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,370
Where are we?

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,070
I'm hungry.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,770
Where are we?

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,970
What happened to us?

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,670
Conan's missing!

24
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,770
Is it Conan?

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,070
Who are you?

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,470
It's that man from before.

27
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,270
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,470
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,970
Something happened at the Yaiba show!

30
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,970
Where did you guys go?

31
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,770
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:10,828
"The Disappearing Youth Detective Squad"

35
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:14,428
"2 hours prior"

36
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:17,528
I'm not sure what's so interesting,

37
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:20,328
but at the very least, he doesn't seem to be a Yaiba fan.

38
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,328
Cut! Okay!

39
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,328
We're moving locations! Hurry, please!

40
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,428
They're changing filming locations.

41
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:29,328
What's next?

42
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:31,628
Over there.

43
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:32,928
Let's hurry.

44
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,328
Conan, Ai, let's go.

45
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,528
Okay.

46
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,928
He's gone.

47
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,128
What?

48
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:43,828
What should we do?

49
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,128
Conan!

50
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:46,428
We're leaving you behind!

51
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,328
Haibara, hurry!

52
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:50,028
Okay, fine.

53
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,428
We'll be right there.

54
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,228
That was fun.

55
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,228
Yaiba was awesome.

56
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,628
I'm so hungry.

57
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,928
"Beika Dumplings"

58
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,828
All right! Dumplings, please!

59
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,728
-Oh, Genta. -Oh, Genta.

60
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,228
You're still thinking about him?

61
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,428
Yeah.

62
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:19,128
"Toshie Nakama (75)" -Thank you.

63
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,328
Someone, help!

64
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:25,428
Oh, no!

65
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,928
That's ten thousand yen!

66
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,028
Catch it!

67
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,428
Genta!

68
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,228
Catch that bill!

69
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,528
What's going on?

70
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,028
Genta, catch it!

71
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:42,028
Hey, wait!

72
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:53,728
I found it!

73
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,028
Found it!

74
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,828
Found it!

75
00:05:57,828 --> 00:06:00,028
-No way! -Why?

76
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,228
There should only be one.

77
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,328
Let me see those.

78
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,028
Are these...

79
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,128
Yeah.

80
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:15,728
They all have the same serial number.

81
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:17,628
Which means these are...

82
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,928
Counterfeit bills...

83
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:24,428
A few counterfeit bills were discovered in the city recently.

84
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:28,828
There is a rumor that an international criminal organization is involved.

85
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,428
That must be it.

86
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:31,828
Which means...

87
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,028
That grandma is a counterfeiter?

88
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,028
-What? -What?

89
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,828
Then I doubt she would've asked us to catch it.

90
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:41,028
Yeah. This one's different.

91
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:46,328
Conan, it's a little damp.

92
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:48,428
It's probably wet from the rain.

93
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:52,028
This is orange juice.

94
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:54,328
It must be that.

95
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,628
A phone?

96
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,828
What does this mean, Conan?

97
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:14,928
While someone was drinking some juice,

98
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:18,928
a strong breeze blew away their counterfeit bills.

99
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:21,128
They spilled their juice then.

100
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:23,028
They rushed to gather them up,

101
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,728
but couldn't get them all,

102
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:27,928
and left without realizing they'd dropped their phone.

103
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,428
Sounds about right.

104
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,028
Amazing.

105
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,528
Way to go, Conan.

106
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:37,028
This is a major incident.

107
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,028
But that means...

108
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:42,728
Yeah. Eventually, the counterfeiter will realize what's missing

109
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,328
and come back for it.

110
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,228
What should we do?

111
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:48,228
Isn't it obvious?

112
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:51,828
The Youth Detective Squad will apprehend him.

113
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,028
It's a stakeout!

114
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:58,428
I think we should call the police.

115
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:04,828
I'm going to call Inspector Megure.

116
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:07,228
Stay with them.

117
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:08,328
Got it.

118
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:13,528
Hello, Inspector Megure?

119
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:16,528
"Metropolitan Police Department" -Conan.

120
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:20,828
What? You're staking out a counterfeiting operation?

121
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:28,928
"Bella Hikifune (38)"

122
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,928
Now, let's send these to the police.

123
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,828
Hey, wait!

124
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,328
Ai, hurry!

125
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,828
She's getting away!

126
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,328
Please hurry!

127
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:07,528
Gosh.

128
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:14,428
What? Where did they go?

129
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:20,128
"Tailing the culprit."

130
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:39,628
Huh?

131
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,428
Maybe she took a turn.

132
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:42,528
This way?

133
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:43,628
That way?

134
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:45,228
Let's go that way.

135
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,228
Hey!

136
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,628
She's not here.

137
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,828
-She's not here. -Did she go that way?

138
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,428
It's a dead end.

139
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,728
Let's go back.

140
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,828
Yeah.

141
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:00,928
When did they get there?

142
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:03,928
Hello, little children.

143
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:08,228
Playtime is over.

144
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,128
Hand over your phones.

145
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:15,128
That's it. They caught us then.

146
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,828
And made us inhale some kind of anesthetic.

147
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:19,428
Yeah, that's right.

148
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,628
Almost there.

149
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:26,928
I'm free!

150
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,728
We did it!

151
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,628
Me, too. Untie me.

152
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:33,528
You got it!

153
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:37,128
Did you really think I'd say that?

154
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:41,128
-What? -There's no way we'd untie you.

155
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:43,928
At first we thought you were a Yaiba fan,

156
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:47,428
but you're super suspicious.

157
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,028
You heard them.

158
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,328
And we don't know where we are.

159
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:22,128
Huh? Something's not right.

160
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:25,728
That tower...

161
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,928
I couldn't see it from here before.

162
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:32,328
That's it. There was a container here earlier.

163
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:35,928
Darn it! Where are they taking us?

164
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,128
Taking us?

165
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:39,228
We're moving?

166
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:45,228
Anyway, where did they go?

167
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:47,228
The number you have dialed

168
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,928
is either outside the service area or currently powered...

169
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,628
What's going on?

170
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:53,928
Haibara.

171
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:56,428
You guys, can you hear me?

172
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,028
Can you hear me?

173
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,528
Conan...

174
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:05,228
Darn it. I can't determine the location of their badges.

175
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:06,628
You guys!

176
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:09,628
Are you guys okay? Where are you?

177
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,128
Hey!

178
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,828
It's that orange juice.

179
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,028
I knew it.

180
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,028
You're the one who lost his counterfeit bills in the wind.

181
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:24,128
Who are you kids?

182
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:25,528
We are...

183
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,928
The Youth Detective Squad...

184
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:31,928
I don't know where we are, but we're moving.

185
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:35,128
We're trapped in here with that man you found suspicious.

186
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:37,928
The counterfeiter.

187
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,528
You're what?

188
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:41,528
You're moving?

189
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,028
And trapped?

190
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:47,228
So that's how it is.

191
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,595
Amazing!

192
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:11,995
It's money!

193
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:14,095
They're all ten thousand yen bills!

194
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,495
Just how much is there?

195
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:22,095
How much eel can I buy with this?

196
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,795
None.

197
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:27,795
They're all counterfeit bills.

198
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:42,495
"Masaya Tatsumi"

199
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:45,895
Why don't you explain yourself, Tatsumi?

200
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,395
That's it!

201
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:12,395
We can't see outside from here,

202
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:14,195
so we don't know where we've traveled.

203
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:15,995
The man trapped in here with us

204
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:19,095
doesn't seem to know where we're going.

205
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:20,095
Come to think of it...

206
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:28,795
It's those footprints.

207
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:29,895
In that case...

208
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:35,595
Crap! The footprints are disappearing!

209
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:46,995
Darn it. Where did it go?

210
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,595
You guys, answer me!

211
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,795
Hit back!

212
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,595
We're in here, Conan!

213
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:55,995
We're in here!

214
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,095
We're in here! We're in here!

215
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:03,195
Darn it. They're in that one?

216
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,995
If they keep heading this way...

217
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,395
They'll reach the harbor.

218
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:16,295
Are they traveling overseas from there?

219
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:27,495
Why don't you talk already, Tatsumi?

220
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:30,795
Why is this happening to you?

221
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,495
What does it matter?

222
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,595
They're just some counterfeit bills.

223
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,995
I just took a few so I could pay off my debts.

224
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,695
Conan!

225
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,195
We're leaving you behind!

226
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:44,095
Haibara, hurry!

227
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,495
We'll be right there.

228
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,595
All right!

229
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,495
Hey, wait!

230
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,495
Darn it. Where did they go?

231
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:17,595
You violated the contract, mister.

232
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:21,395
Why don't you return all the notes you took?

233
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:27,995
That's why she was at that park.

234
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:29,695
Edogawa, did you get all of that?

235
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,995
Yeah. She's probably a mafia.

236
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,395
Mafia...

237
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,795
Probably one specialized in counterfeiting.

238
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,295
Am I wrong?

239
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:41,895
No.

240
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:43,695
But I was just an underling.

241
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:46,395
I got sick of being worked so hard.

242
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:49,195
We stopped.

243
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:50,295
It stopped?

244
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,095
Crap. Is the ship leaving?

245
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,495
We're being lifted?

246
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:07,695
That must be it.

247
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:21,795
Darn it. Which one is it?

248
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,195
Haibara, you guys!

249
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,795
What's going on?

250
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,895
It's like an elevator.

251
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,595
I feel sick.

252
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,895
Could it be...

253
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:37,695
Could it be? Could it be what?

254
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:40,795
Water?

255
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,795
What's wrong, you guys?

256
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:44,795
Answer me!

257
00:17:44,795 --> 00:17:46,495
Haibara! Genta!

258
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,395
Mitsuhiko! Ayumi!

259
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:49,595
Answer me!

260
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:55,195
Bravo. Toys these days sure are amazing.

261
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,095
I called the police on the way here.

262
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,295
You can't escape now.

263
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:14,895
Oh, really?

264
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:19,895
Let go!

265
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,195
We're from the Metropolitan Police Department.

266
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:32,595
You must be Bella Hikifune, the owner of this ship.

267
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,995
We were told your ship was full of counterfeit bills.

268
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:38,095
We'll be searching it.

269
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:39,595
We've also been informed

270
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,895
that you've kidnapped and imprisoned the child witnesses.

271
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:44,595
Oh, how scary.

272
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:48,895
But as exceptional Japanese policemen,

273
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:52,595
surely you realize this isn't a Japanese ship.

274
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,095
If you don't find anything,

275
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:56,795
this will be a major international incident.

276
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,395
How does that sound?

277
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,195
Well...

278
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:14,695
You're welcome to search it if you'd like.

279
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,695
If you discover a single piece of evidence...

280
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:22,395
The evidence is right here!

281
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,395
-Conan? -Conan?

282
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:25,995
Look at that!

283
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:26,995
What?

284
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,095
What is it?

285
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:38,295
Keep it up, everyone!

286
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:41,295
Darn it! I can't do this!

287
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,695
I'm at my limit!

288
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,895
Help!

289
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:47,395
I can't swim!

290
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:11,895
You guys. Thank goodness.

291
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:18,695
I was so scared.

292
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:23,695
We did it. We've been saved.

293
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:26,195
I'm hungry.

294
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,695
Could you come with us to the station?

295
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:37,095
Oh, I'm just the owner.

296
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,195
The crew must've done this on their own.

297
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:42,595
Hey, let me see your wallet.

298
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:45,195
You've got a ten thousand yen bill, right?

299
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:47,495
I don't have any counterfeit bills.

300
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,795
Not that.

301
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:51,795
The old woman's ten thousand yen bill.

302
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:53,095
That's it.

303
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,195
What?

304
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,695
But doesn't that make you a thief?

305
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,995
You're one cheap mafia.

306
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:18,195
More importantly...

307
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:22,695
If you've touched the other counterfeit bills with those hands...

308
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:29,495
But they're soaked. The evidence must be ruined.

309
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,495
You mean these?

310
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,395
Shall we compare your fingerprints?

311
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:42,795
No, there's no need for that.

312
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,595
Amazing. Ai, when did you grab those?

313
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:49,895
You must've been watching while you were following her.

314
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:50,895
Yeah.

315
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,695
"Tailing the culprit."

316
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:04,495
Really?

317
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:06,495
You really are amazing.

318
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:09,795
No wonder you're a member of the Youth Detective Squad.

319
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,595
That's not much of a compliment.

320
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:13,895
They can hear you.

321
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,395
I don't care.

322
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:43,695
The ten thousand yen note was returned to the old woman,

323
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:46,795
who generously thanked the Youth Detective Squad.

324
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,695
So good!

325
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:58,895
"Next Episode" -Who was that man?

326
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,995
Which means the weapon disappeared later.

327
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:05,195
Did someone take it?

328
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,695
We should be focusing on the certainty of their alibis...

329
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:12,495
when determining the culprit.

330
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:16,595
This time I'll run down the culprit.

331
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:18,295
So that's how it is.

332
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:24,379
Next Conan, "A Day Without Conan"

333
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:27,738
Next Conan's Hint:

334
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:29,138
"A coat"

335
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:30,938
The Youth Detective Dumplings.

336
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,438
Don't call us that.

337
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,138
-I don't like it. -I think it's nice.
