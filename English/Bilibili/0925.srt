1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,970
Thanks, Dr. Agasa.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,970
Sure.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,370
What was Kudo doing here so early on a Sunday morning?

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,470
He came to get his phone that I repaired.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,470
I told him you'd bring it to the soccer game today,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,970
but he said he'd come get it right away.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,570
Gosh! 17 received messages?

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,470
"From Ran: School Trip"

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,870
They're all from Ran?

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,970
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,170
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,170
Ran's messages are about the school trip.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,070
I wish I could respond right away.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,770
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:48,811
"The Heartfelt Strap (Part 1)"

18
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:15,411
Yes!

19
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:27,211
Next stop, Beika. Beika.

20
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,711
That was amazing!

21
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,711
Did you see Hide's long shot?

22
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:34,811
Yes!

23
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,611
I can't believe he scored from that far away!

24
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:41,611
BIG Osaka's goalie was surprised, too!

25
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:45,011
What? A school trip?

26
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,911
Yes, for Teitan High School.

27
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,911
So, you know...

28
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,711
You want to use the APTX 4869 antidote

29
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,611
to restore your body so you can participate, right?

30
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,711
I knew you'd understand, Haibara!

31
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:58,911
No.

32
00:03:58,911 --> 00:03:59,911
What?

33
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,511
The effects of the antidote are still only temporary.

34
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,811
If you continuously take it

35
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:09,611
in order to remain in your original body during the school trip,

36
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,911
there's no telling what kind of side effects there could be.

37
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,111
And besides, when you went to London...

38
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,611
What about your passport?

39
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:17,611
What?

40
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:22,811
Oh, crap! I completely forgot about it!

41
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,411
There's one way that you could go, though.

42
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:28,511
You're sure lucky thanks to Ai's great idea.

43
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,311
Yeah, I'm grateful.

44
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:34,111
Conan and Doc aren't coming out.

45
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:36,011
Ran!

46
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,311
Conan?

47
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,711
When did you come out?

48
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,411
Just a while ago.

49
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,511
You didn't see us?

50
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:45,311
The drug didn't wear off for a while,

51
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,011
so I had to stay confined in the restroom for 30 minutes.

52
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,811
Hello?

53
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:53,611
Sorry, Shinichi.

54
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:56,011
It's me.

55
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,611
Oh, no! It's Shinichi's cell phone!

56
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,111
You can hear it, can't you?

57
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,211
The chime of this Big Ben.

58
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,611
This Big Ben...

59
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,011
Don't tell me you're here? In London?

60
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:16,711
Shinichi, you can't run away from me anymore.

61
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:19,911
You'd better have a good explanation.

62
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:21,711
Shinichi!

63
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,711
Don't tell me you drank the antidote

64
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,311
that you were going to drink upon departure?

65
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,311
Shinichi?

66
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,911
Sorry.

67
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,211
I've come up with an urgent matter,

68
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:39,611
and can't go over there.

69
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,411
You've got to really be grateful to Ai!

70
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,511
Yeah.

71
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,411
And the Shiragami case!

72
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:50,511
I had a local doctor come.

73
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:53,811
I told you, he's fine.

74
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,011
But...

75
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,111
Haibara! What are you doing here?

76
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,011
There's no time to explain.

77
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,411
Take this immediately.

78
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,611
Is this...

79
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:23,511
Yes. It's a prototype antidote to the APTX 4869

80
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,911
that turned you into a child.

81
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:29,811
The same as the one you took yesterday.

82
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,611
Will it last 24 hours again?

83
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,011
You idiot.

84
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:38,311
Just as habitually consuming the same medicine reduces its effects,

85
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:41,811
your body has developed a resistance to that medicine.

86
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,411
If you keep using it,

87
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:45,911
its duration decreases, too.

88
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,911
If you want to keep your identity hidden,

89
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:52,411
you'll have to say goodbye to them before its effects run out

90
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,311
and you turn back into Conan Edogawa.

91
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:58,411
I've saved you countless times with my quick wits

92
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,911
when the effects of the medicine expired

93
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,411
and your identity was about to be discovered!

94
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:03,211
You still haven't learned your lesson?

95
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,011
Calm down.

96
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:08,211
I know you're upset because BIG Osaka lost,

97
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,311
but you were in a great mood

98
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,511
since you got to meet Higo in the stands,

99
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,611
who was out of the game due to an injury.

100
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:21,511
I even wore a BIG hat today and cheered for them.

101
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:24,911
You shouldn't have done that.

102
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,811
You're the reason they lost!

103
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,511
She's still upset over the loss.

104
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,211
It's so shiny.

105
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,711
I just polished it yesterday.

106
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,711
Either way, give up on that school trip.

107
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:49,011
We apologize for the sudden stop due to a red light.

108
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,211
-It hurts... -The doors will open

109
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,711
once we've confirmed it's safe to exit the train.

110
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:55,911
Are you okay, Haibara?

111
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,911
Yes, I'm fine.

112
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,111
Thanks.

113
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,811
You're not hurt, are you?

114
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,311
No.

115
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:04,611
You scraped your knee!

116
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,111
Do you need me to support you?

117
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,211
The doors are opening.

118
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,911
Being nice to me won't work.

119
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:15,611
As expected.

120
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,811
You met Higo in the stands?

121
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,711
That's great.

122
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,011
Yeah. He was really cool.

123
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:29,111
Ai was blushing.

124
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,711
We even got to talk with him a little.

125
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,711
Yeah.

126
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:36,711
And you got a Higo phone strap.

127
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:39,311
It was the last one.

128
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,311
I was very lucky.

129
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:45,111
Haibara's mood is improving.

130
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:49,111
BIG might've won if Higo were in the game.

131
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:54,411
Hey, Genta.

132
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,711
Come to think of it, I got a photo of it.

133
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,011
I'll show you.

134
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,211
Yes, please.

135
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:02,811
Wait, what?

136
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,311
What's wrong?

137
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,711
It's recording.

138
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,611
What? You're right.

139
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,411
Since when?

140
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:13,311
It seems to have started while we were on the train.

141
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,411
What?

142
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,911
That long?

143
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:18,911
I seem to have pressed the button

144
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,711
when I made sure I hadn't dropped my phone

145
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,711
after the train suddenly stopped and we fell.

146
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,511
It's because you keep yours in the rear pocket of your pants.

147
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,011
Why were you keeping it there?

148
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,311
I saw Haibara doing it,

149
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,911
so I copied her.

150
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:37,411
Ai, is your phone okay?

151
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,011
Yeah. It's right here in...

152
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,111
What's wrong, Haibara?

153
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,211
It's gone.

154
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:54,911
The Higo strap I attached to my phone is gone!

155
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,011
No way!

156
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,311
Seriously?

157
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:00,411
You mean the very last one you got, right?

158
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,511
I'm sure you'll be able to buy one online soon.

159
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,811
-I can't! -What?

160
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:11,311
That strap is special. Today, Higo...

161
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,611
What?

162
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,111
It's you.

163
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:21,411
You're the girl from the case at Asuka's restaurant.

164
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,511
Yes.

165
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:27,411
What? They're selling that now?

166
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:35,311
It's actually cute, unlike me.

167
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,811
And then he touched it!

168
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:43,811
There's only one strap like that in the world!

169
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,011
Ai?

170
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:57,911
But where did we lose it?

171
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:00,511
Probably when we fell on the train.

172
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:02,911
Mitsuhiko.

173
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:06,211
Let me see that video you accidentally recorded on your phone.

174
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,411
Okay.

175
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,211
Are you okay, Haibara?

176
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,511
That man next to the train doors...

177
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,111
He's picking something up.

178
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,311
Isn't that the Higo strap?

179
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,411
You're right. It looks like it.

180
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,111
That must be it.

181
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:30,611
Then maybe he delivered it to the station's lost and found.

182
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,011
Call them right away.

183
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:34,511
Got it. For Ai.

184
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,411
What? You have it?

185
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:42,911
Yes, it's a phone strap of a soccer player.

186
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,211
Yes, that's it.

187
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:47,011
We'll come by later to pick it up.

188
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:48,511
All right...

189
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,011
Ai, they have it!

190
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,511
She's still dazed.

191
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:55,611
Yeah.

192
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:00,611
We'll go to Beika Station to pick it up.

193
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:01,811
Yeah...

194
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,211
Wait...

195
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:04,211
What?

196
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,711
It's at the station in Chiyari City.

197
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,611
Chiyari City?

198
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,211
Isn't that pretty far away?

199
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,511
-What should we do? -I'm out of money.

200
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:18,011
My turbo-powered skateboard is being repaired.

201
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,411
Dr. Agasa, could you drive us there in your Beetle?

202
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,311
-Yes. -Please!

203
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:26,711
My bartender friend's borrowing it.

204
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,511
No way...

205
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,011
There's no rush.

206
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,611
You can go get it tomorrow.

207
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:37,111
In that case, I'll run there.

208
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,811
What?

209
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,211
But it's tens of kilometers away!

210
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,711
What?

211
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,611
Is something the matter?

212
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,111
Subaru!

213
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:52,411
Since I was told I hadn't stewed my curry long enough the other day,

214
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:56,511
I brought a new batch to share.

215
00:12:56,511 --> 00:13:00,011
More importantly, Haibara's very important phone strap

216
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:02,311
was taken to Chiyari Station.

217
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:04,711
We're on our way to get it right now.

218
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,611
Could you drive us there?

219
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,111
I see.

220
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:12,711
She's not going?

221
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:15,711
No. She's pretty shocked about the whole thing.

222
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:18,811
Unfortunately,

223
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,811
I need to use my car after this.

224
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,211
What?

225
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,711
You can't take us?

226
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:28,911
But I saw a familiar car parked next to this house.

227
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:30,811
Why don't you ask him?

228
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,011
A familiar car?

229
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:36,411
A white RX-7.

230
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:49,478
I knew it!

231
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:51,178
It's Amuro.

232
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,578
What are you doing here?

233
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:57,078
I got sleepy while driving in the area,

234
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,078
so I took a nap.

235
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:01,678
What are you kids doing?

236
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:03,778
We're going to Chiyari Station

237
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,478
to pick up the phone strap our friend dropped.

238
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:09,378
Could you drive us there?

239
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,278
Please!

240
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,878
I'd also like to ask...

241
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,778
that you do this.

242
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:21,378
Though if there's some reason you don't want to leave this place,

243
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,878
then I suppose it can't be helped.

244
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:27,678
Yes, I wanted to nap a little longer,

245
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:29,378
but that's too bad.

246
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:33,178
This is a thrillingly good place to nap.

247
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:34,678
"Toto Metro Lost and Found"

248
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:37,178
Thanks for waiting, kids.

249
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:39,578
Here. This is the strap, right?

250
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:43,078
What? That's not it!

251
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:45,178
That's Sanada.

252
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,178
We lost a Higo strap.

253
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,778
What? This isn't it?

254
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:55,078
Was this the man who turned that in?

255
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,178
No, it was a younger man.

256
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:03,278
What? What's going on?

257
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,778
Maybe...

258
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:07,578
Could I see that?

259
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:10,278
This man in the photo appears to be

260
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:14,078
the father of the boy standing next to him.

261
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,678
Maybe he mistook the Higo strap your friend dropped

262
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:21,378
for the Sanada strap his son dropped

263
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,078
and picked up yours.

264
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,278
Unless you're a passionate fan,

265
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,278
"Higo, Sanada" -they probably all look the same.

266
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,378
In other words, someone picked up the Sanada strap his son dropped

267
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:37,478
and turned it in here.

268
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,478
Then we need to find the father and son recorded by my phone.

269
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,278
But how are we going to find them?

270
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,578
We don't even know their names.

271
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,878
Yes, I agree.

272
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:51,378
Why don't we think about that once we return to my car?

273
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:53,078
Okay...

274
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,978
Oh, right.

275
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:01,278
Excuse me!

276
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:02,278
Yes?

277
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,478
Was a badge turned in along with that strap?

278
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:07,678
A badge?

279
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,878
No, I don't think so.

280
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,578
I see.

281
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,178
Thank you!

282
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:17,078
Genta, what are you doing?

283
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,978
Oh, sorry.

284
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:24,078
I lost my Detective Badge on the train, too.

285
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,678
Your Detective Badge?

286
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:28,278
Dr. Agasa made them for us.

287
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,978
We all have them.

288
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:40,378
Now then, how should we find this man with his son...

289
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:44,478
who picked up the Higo strap

290
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:49,178
your friend dropped on the train?

291
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,878
Both of them look very tan.

292
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:56,278
You're right.

293
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,178
They're so dark.

294
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,478
Maybe...

295
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,878
they're on their way to go swimming at the beach.

296
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:06,678
No, that's not it.

297
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,178
Why not?

298
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:12,678
This video was taken while we were on the train

299
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:14,678
after the soccer game that ended at 3 pm.

300
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:17,978
We arrived at Beika Station 10 minutes after that.

301
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:22,078
So if they were going swimming, they would've left earlier.

302
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:23,778
You're right.

303
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:26,978
Then maybe they're on their way back from the beach.

304
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,378
That's not it either.

305
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,478
What?

306
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:32,778
We were riding the Shonan Shinjuku train.

307
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:36,078
"Takasaki, Omiya, Shinjuku" -It departs from Takasaki in Gunma

308
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,178
"Odawara, Yokohama, Beika, Ofuna" -and passes through Shinjuku and Yokohama

309
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:41,378
on its way to Odawara in Kanagawa.

310
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:44,178
And the beach doesn't reach Beika Station.

311
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:46,178
Maybe they went to an indoor pool.

312
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:47,778
Or bug hunting.

313
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:51,278
Or maybe they just went to an acquaintance's house.

314
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,978
In that case,

315
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:58,378
did you overhear any of their conversation?

316
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,478
Their conversation?

317
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:06,178
I was bragging about how I polished my badge.

318
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:07,578
Come to think of it,

319
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,278
the dad said to his son,

320
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:13,278
"It's about as long as it takes to watch Kamen Yaiba."

321
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,978
But Kamen Yaiba wasn't on today.

322
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,978
Isn't it on tomorrow?

323
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,978
Before his father said that,

324
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,678
did the boy ask him,

325
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:26,178
"How much longer?"

326
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,078
Yeah, he did.

327
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,078
Which means

328
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,478
it's possible he was using the 30-minute Kamen Yaiba program

329
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:36,478
to explain to his son how much longer it would take

330
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:38,578
to arrive at their destination.

331
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:40,278
I see.

332
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,278
Do you know when they said that?

333
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:47,278
Yes. It was after the train screeched to a stop

334
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:49,778
and everyone fell.

335
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:54,178
"Beika, Yokohama" -So it's 30 minutes from Beika Station.

336
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,478
"Chiyari, Ofuna" -That's here around Chiyari Station.

337
00:18:56,478 --> 00:19:01,278
That boy seemed to be a first-year elementary school student like us.

338
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:05,578
It's not unreasonable that his father would use Yaiba as an example.

339
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,578
How do you know he's a first-year?

340
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:14,678
Because he breathed on the train window

341
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,478
and wrote something with his finger.

342
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:20,078
He said, "It's only hiragana, but I can write it now."

343
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:22,178
"Aren't you proud?"

344
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:25,678
I think he was writing his own name.

345
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:29,578
Unfortunately, I couldn't see what he wrote.

346
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:33,578
Do you remember which car you were riding in?

347
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:37,278
We got on in the middle of the third car from the front, right?

348
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:38,378
Yes.

349
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,478
You really don't remember what he wrote?

350
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:44,678
No.

351
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:49,178
I do remember his pale finger pressed against the window though.

352
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:51,278
Pale finger?

353
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:54,478
They're both really dark from being so tan.

354
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:58,078
But if you look closely at the video...

355
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:00,378
See? It's both of them.

356
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:08,278
They're both pale from the wrist down!

357
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:12,178
And look at the dad's bag.

358
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,978
It looks like there's something angular inside it.

359
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:18,478
Maybe he put his cooler inside his bag

360
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,278
since the strap broke.

361
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:22,378
Are they going fishing?

362
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:24,678
But they don't have fishing rods.

363
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:28,278
And they're too lightly dressed to go hiking.

364
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:29,978
Maybe...

365
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,478
Maybe?

366
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:34,078
They could be digging for clams.

367
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,078
Dig...

368
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,978
Digging for clams?

369
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,378
You go digging for clams in spring.

370
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:42,278
We're on summer break.

371
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:46,178
Actually, you can do it all year round.

372
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,978
What? Really?

373
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:50,178
Yes.

374
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:55,678
April to May is the best season because the climate means

375
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:59,078
the clams are full of nutrients from spawning.

376
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:01,378
But there are plenty of beaches that are open

377
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:04,878
to digging for clams as late as July.

378
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:08,378
And low tide at Chiyari Beach

379
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:10,978
is at 5:59 today.

380
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,078
When digging for clams,

381
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:16,678
it's best to arrive an hour or two before low tide,

382
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:19,678
so it makes sense that they took that train.

383
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,178
Really?

384
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:23,978
-Then... -If we go to that beach...

385
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:27,378
We'll be able to retrieve Haibara's strap!

386
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:32,378
Once that boy realizes the strap his dad picked up isn't his,

387
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,178
I'm sure he'll hand it over.

388
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,478
Yeah. And once we get it,

389
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:41,978
we won't let anyone else take it until we return it to Ai!

390
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,178
No matter what!

391
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,478
Yeah!

392
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,278
Yes! Haibara will be so happy!

393
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:51,678
-This is great! -Yes!

394
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,478
I'm so happy!

395
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:57,178
I'll go settle the bill.

396
00:21:57,178 --> 00:22:00,478
You kids head to the car.

397
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:02,178
Sure.

398
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:04,878
Thanks, Amuro.

399
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:07,078
Thanks for the food...

400
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,378
Kazami.

401
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:57,878
"Next Episode" -She's in that state

402
00:23:57,878 --> 00:24:00,578
because she lost the Higo strap?

403
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:02,178
Yeah.

404
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:06,278
It's less likely that it won't be found.

405
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,678
Japan's top two inspectors are on the case.

406
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:12,278
Breathe on it.

407
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:13,278
What?

408
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,278
Nice one, Amuro.

409
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:17,178
Now that we know that...

410
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:24,378
Next Conan, "The Heartfelt Strap (Part 2)"

411
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,321
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,521
"Haibara's Strap"

413
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,821
Amuro, thank you.

414
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:33,521
With you, looking for lost objects becomes a profound experience.
