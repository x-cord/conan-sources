1
00:00:04.353 --> 00:00:07.173
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:09.733
Today's a lodge mystery!

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.433
Who's the mysterious bandaged man?

4
00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:14.143
He sees the single truth
for what it is,

5
00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:16.353
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:18.353
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.880
The Mountain Lodge Bandage
Man Murder Case (Part 1).

8
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.510
Huh? That's strange...

9
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.230
The lodge should be
right around here...

10
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.060
Say, we're not lost, are we?

11
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.140
Eep...

12
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.310
Of course not!

13
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.640
We're just taking
a little side trip!

14
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.990
We're lost.

15
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.140
We're here!

16
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.120
Look, Conan-kun! There it is!

17
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.080
Oh? Someone's walking...

18
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.850
I wonder if he's going
to the lodge too?

19
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.310
I wonder if he's going
to the lodge too?

20
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.560
I don't think so...

21
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.520
You're late, Ran!
What were you doing?!

22
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.520
Sorry, Sonoko!

23
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.980
I'm nice enough to let you stay
at my family's lodge

24
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.480
and you show up late...

25
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.060
I figured you'd bring him.

26
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.650
You should be more
considerate, Conan-kun!

27
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.620
As if you're one to talk...

28
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.600
Keep hanging around this twerp
and you'll never fall in love!

29
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.580
Love?

30
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.140
Yeah! We're here to meet
some wonderful guys!

31
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.850
And with nature all around us,

32
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.050
we'll have dream-like
romances with them!

33
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.010
Oh yeah, I forgot she's
that kind of person...

34
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.850
Oh? These "wonderful guys"
aren't here yet?

35
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.560
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.560
My sister's friends
got here long ago

37
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.440
and are relaxing in their rooms.

38
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.900
That reminds me, is one of their
faces wrapped in bandages?

39
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.390
Bandages? No...

40
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.620
None of the people here are hurt...

41
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.730
But we just saw--

42
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.080
Maybe he lives nearby, then...

43
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.730
Alright, stop being a weirdo
and put your stuff away!

44
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.250
You guys' room is upstairs!

45
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.470
Okay!

46
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.810
Wait, look at all
these rooms up here...

47
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.310
Which one is ours?

48
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.270
I'm sorry! My mistake!

49
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.030
Here we go!
This is ours, Conan-kun!

50
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.240
Geez, learn to knock
before opening doors!

51
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.210
You're all from the same circle?

52
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.170
Yeah! They all made films together
during my sister's college days.

53
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.140
The five closest people got
together for the first time in two years!

54
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.650
Next to Ran is Ota-san,

55
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.850
who usually played the leading role!

56
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.850
Yo!

57
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.390
Next to him is Sumiya-san,
our cameraman!

58
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.310
Hiya!

59
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.640
Our stage manager,
Takahashi-san!

60
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.980
Hello!

61
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.690
I apologize for earlier!

62
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.690
That's okay!

63
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.480
Huh? What did you do?

64
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.510
Nothing really...

65
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.810
Next up is our makeup
and wardrobe person,

66
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.430
my sister, who is also
looking for a husband!

67
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.500
That's enough.

68
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.390
And last is our director,
scriptwriter, and club president--

69
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.270
Ikeda Chikako-san!

70
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.460
Nice to meet you.

71
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.930
The same Ikeda Chikako-san who wrote
the very latest movie, "Blue Kingdom"?!

72
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.020
That's right!

73
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.850
She wrote it during college
and it started her career, right?

74
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.140
Don't drag up old stories like that!

75
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.180
I hear there's talk
about your next movie...

76
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.610
Ikeda-sensei! How about
a word for your fans?

77
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.070
Stop being silly, Sumiya-kun.

78
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.980
You still love to tape things, I see...

79
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.490
Yeah! I can't kick the habit!

80
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.460
Hey, Takahashi!
Have you gotten fatter?

81
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.520
Yeah, I guess I'm about
100 kilograms now...

82
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.450
I can't get you in frame anymore!

83
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.260
Yeah, I bet!

84
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.600
This certainly brings back
memories of college!

85
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.720
And Atsuko...

86
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.520
I'm sure she'd be here now
if she hadn't done that...

87
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.480
Atsuko?

88
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.730
Let's not talk about her!

89
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.650
Chikako...

90
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.480
I took time out of my
busy schedule to be here.

91
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.350
Let's not talk about someone
who died two years ago!

92
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.120
I'm sorry...

93
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.770
Celebrities sure do
say strange things...

94
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.650
What's that mean?!

95
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.080
Now, now, you two!

96
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.640
I'll go make dinner now,
so just make yourselves at home!

97
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.980
In that case, I'll go
finish fixing the roof!

98
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.850
They said it was going
to rain this evening!

99
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.310
I'd appreciate that,
Takahashi-kun!

100
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.540
Be careful!

101
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.200
Yeah!

102
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.350
Sounds like the perfect
kind of work for a set designer!

103
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.770
What do you say
the rest of us play cards?

104
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.560
Yeah! I'll play!

105
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.780
Where're you going, Chikako?!

106
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.910
For a walk.

107
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.680
Wait!

108
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.750
Takahashi said it's gonna rain!

109
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.350
Come on, Chikako!

110
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.600
It's really coming down...

111
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.260
There's no enjoying the view now.

112
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.520
Hey, Ran!

113
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.730
Isn't he dreamy?

114
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.650
He's like so cool and suave--
totally my type!

115
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.770
You think?

116
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.360
Oh, that's right,
you have Shinichi-kun!

117
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.820
It's too bad he couldn't
come with you...

118
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.540
As if! I'd bust him upside
the head if he were here!

119
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.600
He is here.

120
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.630
Say. Would you like
to take a walk with me?

121
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.430
I'd love to!

122
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.640
After all, you're not
doing anything.

123
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.600
But it's raining outside...

124
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.060
Walks in the rain
can be invigorating.

125
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.310
Let's go!

126
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.220
Wait!

127
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.290
That bastard!

128
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.730
She'll pay!

129
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.180
That lousy Ran!
She has Shinichi-kun!

130
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.350
Yeah!

131
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.690
Maybe I'll steal Shinichi-kun from her!

132
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.000
No. No, you won't.

133
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.460
Eh? There's someone you like?

134
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.850
Yes...

135
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.980
But you don't know
when he'll be back, right?

136
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.480
You should dump
the cold-hearted jerk

137
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.180
and find a better man!

138
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.140
How about I teach you...

139
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.600
...what adult love is?

140
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.050
Wait--

141
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.980
Lightning!

142
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.110
Hey!

143
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.570
Whoa, that was
a really close one!

144
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.830
Oh no! They're gone!

145
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.600
Ahh! Conan-kun!

146
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.080
Really, now...

147
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.540
I think I might be lost...

148
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.980
Ota-san, where are you?

149
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.470
Say something if you're there!
Ota-san!

150
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.850
Ran!

151
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.570
That's--

152
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.180
What are you screaming about--

153
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.450
Damn it!

154
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.920
Who was that?!

155
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.380
A man in bandages?!

156
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.560
Yeah! He attacked
Ran in the forest!

157
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.840
You serious?!

158
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.600
Oh? You guys didn't see him?

159
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.480
Weren't the three of you
in the forest too?

160
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.680
I just went looking for Ran-chan--

161
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.140
I didn't see anything like that...

162
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.310
We didn't see him either,
right, Chikako?

163
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.480
We?

164
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.140
You went and disappeared
somewhere!

165
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.640
I went to get an umbrella!

166
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.980
Are you sure you weren't
afraid of the lightning?

167
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.110
Chikako!

168
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.980
What?!

169
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.990
Now, now, you two!

170
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.200
I guess it's almost over
between them...

171
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.270
Hey, did you see the guy?

172
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.910
He ran toward the lodge...

173
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.060
No, I didn't see anything...

174
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.670
Did you see him, Takahashi-kun?

175
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.180
I was on the roof
the entire time,

176
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.730
but I don't remember
seeing anyone like that...

177
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.680
But I did see someone
strange by the bridge

178
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.730
when I first got here...

179
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.480
I couldn't really see his face,

180
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.400
but he was wearing
a black cape and a hood.

181
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.850
Yes! That's the person
who attacked me!

182
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.870
Right, Conan-kun?

183
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.320
Yeah!

184
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.980
I saw the same guy
when I got here!

185
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.290
Same here! But I figured
he lived nearby...

186
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.100
That can't be!

187
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.310
There are only two or three lodges
on the other side of the bridge,

188
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.750
and there's a mountain on this side...

189
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.310
Then who was that guy?!

190
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.680
We should call the police!

191
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.930
Yes!

192
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.730
What? The phone's not working?!

193
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.890
But it was working this afternoon...

194
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.980
Maybe the phones are down
because of that lightning strike?

195
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.480
It was him! That
bandaged man cut the line!

196
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.510
It was him!

197
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.000
Hey, Takahashi!

198
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.020
Wait!

199
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.560
What is it?!

200
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.140
The bridge is out!

201
00:12:32.676 --> 00:12:33.976
What happened?!

202
00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:36.046
The bridge is out.

203
00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:39.086
Probably fell on its own.
It was pretty old.

204
00:12:39.086 --> 00:12:40.636
No.

205
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:43.126
Someone cut it down.

206
00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:47.136
Take a look at this bridge support.

207
00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:50.556
What the hell?!
It's been chopped up!

208
00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:53.926
Somebody used some sort of blade...

209
00:12:53.926 --> 00:12:56.526
But who on earth would do this?

210
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.486
It was that guy!
He did this too!

211
00:12:59.856 --> 00:13:01.046
Oh, come on!

212
00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.316
This "bandaged man" is ridiculous!

213
00:13:03.876 --> 00:13:06.926
He attacked the girl in
the forest, cut the phone line,

214
00:13:06.926 --> 00:13:10.786
and chopped the bridge down because
he enjoys watching us get scared!

215
00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:13.086
If we keep getting afraid,

216
00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:14.906
we'll be giving him what he wants!

217
00:13:17.676 --> 00:13:19.216
Chikako...

218
00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:21.626
Anyway, it's dark out,
so our only choice

219
00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:24.846
is to wait until
tomorrow morning.

220
00:13:25.676 --> 00:13:29.216
Plus this "bandaged man"
everyone's worked up about

221
00:13:29.216 --> 00:13:31.466
might still be hiding in the forest.

222
00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:32.546
Yes...

223
00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.306
Oh?

224
00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:41.696
What's wrong?

225
00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:46.336
I'm going to bed now.
I'm suddenly tired.

226
00:13:46.336 --> 00:13:47.656
I won't need any dinner.

227
00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:49.616
Chikako...

228
00:13:59.216 --> 00:14:01.966
Sorry for making you help, Ran-chan!

229
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.546
No problem!
I always do this at home!

230
00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:08.086
What a reunion
this has turned into...

231
00:14:08.086 --> 00:14:10.876
Everyone's suddenly unsociable...

232
00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:14.016
It's all because you
mentioned that incident!

233
00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:16.356
You mean about Atsuko-san?

234
00:14:17.426 --> 00:14:20.256
The girl that had something
happen two years ago--

235
00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.316
That's enough, Conan-kun!

236
00:14:22.216 --> 00:14:25.776
She killed herself.
Two years ago.

237
00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:29.236
She was a member
of our filmmaking group, too!

238
00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:32.716
Then she suddenly
hanged herself in her room,

239
00:14:32.716 --> 00:14:35.626
and everyone stopped
meeting after that.

240
00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:37.706
We were all so close, too...

241
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:44.046
That's why I asked everyone here
for a long-overdue reunion!

242
00:14:44.046 --> 00:14:47.376
So let's not talk about
that anymore, alright?

243
00:14:47.376 --> 00:14:48.136
Alright.

244
00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:50.596
Man, I'm starving.

245
00:14:51.256 --> 00:14:52.686
Oh? Where's Chikako?

246
00:14:52.686 --> 00:14:54.556
She went to bed early.

247
00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:57.426
Takahashi-kun! Dinner's ready!

248
00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:59.266
I'll be down in a sec.

249
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.346
Well? Is the roof fixed?

250
00:15:01.346 --> 00:15:02.736
Yeah, for the most part.

251
00:15:02.976 --> 00:15:05.196
Smile, you two!

252
00:15:07.376 --> 00:15:09.296
Get down here, Takahashi!

253
00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:10.836
The food's gonna get cold!

254
00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:12.286
Yeah, I'm coming.

255
00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:15.196
Who're you?!

256
00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:15.916
What is it?!

257
00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:18.496
There's someone
by the downstairs window!

258
00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.456
By the window?

259
00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:28.296
Chikako!

260
00:15:28.626 --> 00:15:31.466
Damn! It's too dark
to see where they went!

261
00:15:33.256 --> 00:15:34.016
Conan-kun!

262
00:15:35.846 --> 00:15:38.096
Alright! Let's follow the kid!

263
00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.766
Lock the doors and wait here!

264
00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:42.146
Come on, Takahashi!

265
00:15:42.146 --> 00:15:43.216
Eh? Me, too?!

266
00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:44.026
Yes, you too!

267
00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.036
Wait for me!

268
00:15:55.256 --> 00:15:56.536
It's a leg!

269
00:15:56.796 --> 00:15:58.926
Don't tell me it's Chikako's?!

270
00:16:01.256 --> 00:16:02.836
There's an arm over here!

271
00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:05.256
What the hell's goin' on?!

272
00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.586
Let's split up and look!

273
00:16:07.586 --> 00:16:10.636
Chikako! Chikako!

274
00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.966
Chikako! Where are you?!

275
00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:20.186
Chikako?

276
00:16:22.626 --> 00:16:24.836
Chikako! Say something! Chikako!

277
00:16:32.796 --> 00:16:34.116
Chikako was?!

278
00:16:34.466 --> 00:16:36.576
Yeah, she had been murdered...

279
00:16:37.336 --> 00:16:39.536
...by the time we got there.

280
00:16:39.716 --> 00:16:41.546
This can't be happening!

281
00:16:41.546 --> 00:16:43.626
For now, we covered
the body with my jacket

282
00:16:43.626 --> 00:16:45.466
and left it in the forest...

283
00:16:45.466 --> 00:16:47.206
Why would someone
kill Chikako-san?!

284
00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:49.626
It's all my fault!

285
00:16:49.626 --> 00:16:52.966
If only I hadn't
planned this reunion,

286
00:16:52.966 --> 00:16:54.676
she'd still be--

287
00:16:55.426 --> 00:16:58.586
That's not true, Ayako!
It's not your fault!

288
00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:00.876
That bandaged man is to blame!

289
00:17:00.876 --> 00:17:03.356
That crazed murderer
who ran off with Chikako

290
00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:05.646
before our very eyes!

291
00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:11.816
What do we do if he comes back?

292
00:17:12.926 --> 00:17:15.876
We'll be fine if we
lock the place down.

293
00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:19.786
Chikako was careless enough
to stroll around outside.

294
00:17:20.086 --> 00:17:24.126
Anyway, let's forget about this
and get some shut-eye.

295
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.546
Ota! How can you--

296
00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:27.756
He's right. It's getting late.

297
00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:31.926
Let's make sure everything
is locked and get some rest.

298
00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:35.296
We'll climb down the mountain
and get the police tomorrow.

299
00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:36.096
Yeah...

300
00:17:41.296 --> 00:17:43.926
Front door's locked.

301
00:17:43.926 --> 00:17:46.126
All that's left is our rooms...

302
00:17:46.126 --> 00:17:47.816
What are you doing, Conan-kun?

303
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:50.776
Chikako-san's slippers aren't here.

304
00:17:50.776 --> 00:17:52.236
Slippers?

305
00:17:52.466 --> 00:17:57.006
If she went out the front door,
her slippers should be here.

306
00:17:57.006 --> 00:18:00.196
She might not have left from here.

307
00:18:00.196 --> 00:18:02.086
What do you mean?

308
00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:05.586
What if the guy
snuck into the lodge

309
00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:07.296
and attacked Chikako-san upstairs?!

310
00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:09.376
Of course he didn't, Sonoko!

311
00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:12.586
Remember? When Conan-kun
and the others ran after him,

312
00:18:12.586 --> 00:18:17.136
you, me, and Ayako-san split up
and checked all the locks!

313
00:18:17.756 --> 00:18:20.796
Chikako-san's room
wasn't in shambles,

314
00:18:20.796 --> 00:18:24.096
and the window was
locked from the inside.

315
00:18:24.096 --> 00:18:25.176
But...

316
00:18:26.426 --> 00:18:29.566
I'm almost certain she went outside.

317
00:18:30.216 --> 00:18:32.926
After all, she was wearing shoes.

318
00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:34.526
Her leg had been
chopped off, though.

319
00:18:35.586 --> 00:18:36.486
I see...

320
00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:41.126
Hey, does this lodge
have any other exits?

321
00:18:41.126 --> 00:18:43.126
Yeah. The back door.

322
00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:43.956
A back door?!

323
00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:47.256
This is the back door.

324
00:18:47.256 --> 00:18:52.376
Here we go! These are definitely
Chikako-san's slippers!

325
00:18:52.926 --> 00:18:55.546
We didn't leave
any spare ones out!

326
00:18:55.796 --> 00:18:59.216
So that means Chikako-san
went out this way...

327
00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:00.506
Yeah, probably.

328
00:19:01.336 --> 00:19:06.256
But why did she go out this way
and not the front door?

329
00:19:06.256 --> 00:19:08.976
It's almost like she was trying
to sneak out unseen...

330
00:19:09.426 --> 00:19:12.086
Say, it's really muddy here--

331
00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:13.316
has someone been using this door?

332
00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.506
Yeah, it was probably my sister;

333
00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:17.526
the gas switch and stuff
is in the backyard.

334
00:19:18.216 --> 00:19:21.086
Well, we found her slippers,
so let's go to bed now.

335
00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.256
Alright!

336
00:19:32.716 --> 00:19:36.376
There! Now our room's
okay too, Conan-kun!

337
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:37.716
Conan-kun?

338
00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:40.716
Stop worrying,
everything'll be all right!

339
00:19:40.716 --> 00:19:42.626
If the bandaged man
shows up again,

340
00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:44.976
I'll beat him up with my karate!

341
00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:46.796
Okay!

342
00:19:46.796 --> 00:19:51.936
Yeah, right! When he attacked you in the
forest you were too scared to do anything!

343
00:19:51.936 --> 00:19:55.756
Say, why do you think
he attacked you, anyway?

344
00:19:55.756 --> 00:19:58.856
I don't know.
Maybe it didn't matter who.

345
00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:00.796
Say, Ran-neechan.

346
00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:03.586
Does anybody have
a grudge against you?

347
00:20:03.586 --> 00:20:07.006
Like anyone whose face
you injured with karate?

348
00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:08.866
Of course not!

349
00:20:08.866 --> 00:20:10.886
Now go to sleep!

350
00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:11.876
Okay.

351
00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:20.376
But there's something odd
about that bandaged man.

352
00:20:20.376 --> 00:20:24.216
If he took Chikako-san,
who left out the back door,

353
00:20:24.216 --> 00:20:27.726
then why would he go around
to the front door for us to see?

354
00:20:28.876 --> 00:20:31.966
To make us afraid? Or perhaps--

355
00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:33.566
Hey.

356
00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:36.026
Can I sleep with you?

357
00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.906
Eh? What for?

358
00:20:37.906 --> 00:20:39.926
Just because.

359
00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:41.336
Is it because you're afraid?

360
00:20:41.336 --> 00:20:42.986
It's just because.

361
00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:45.446
Sweet dreams, Conan-kun.

362
00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:48.676
Girls have some nerve!

363
00:20:48.676 --> 00:20:50.866
Now where was I?

364
00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:53.376
That bandaged man had just--

365
00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:57.046
As I was saying...

366
00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.756
Oh no! I can't think!

367
00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.796
Well, this is a crazed
murderer we're dealing with;

368
00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.466
this is a job
for the police, not me...

369
00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.016
Time for sleep...

370
00:21:09.016 --> 00:21:10.976
Can I sleep?

371
00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:10.556
He's after Ran!

372
00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:13.096
Wake up, Ran!

373
00:23:13.096 --> 00:23:14.726
Ran! Ran!

374
00:23:15.036 --> 00:23:15.976
Damn it!

375
00:23:20.126 --> 00:23:21.466
Ow!

376
00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:23.686
Oh no! I sprained my ankle!

377
00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:26.836
Once Ran falls asleep,
there's no waking her up!

378
00:23:26.836 --> 00:23:28.276
Isn't there anything around here?!

379
00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:31.716
That's it!
The Voice-Altering Bow Tie!

380
00:23:31.716 --> 00:23:34.286
I'll crank up the volume, and--

381
00:23:34.286 --> 00:23:36.246
Get up!

382
00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.756
Ran! Conan-kun!
What's going on?!

383
00:23:51.176 --> 00:23:53.716
Open the door! Conan-kun! Ran!

384
00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:58.096
Wait!

385
00:23:59.016 --> 00:23:59.976
Conan-kun!

386
00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:03.296
Damn it! Why?!

387
00:24:03.296 --> 00:24:05.216
Why is he after Ran?!

388
00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:20.416
The bandaged man is after Ran!

389
00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:22.036
But why her?!

390
00:24:22.956 --> 00:24:24.876
Something's nagging at me...

391
00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:26.756
Think back, Ran-neechan!

392
00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.426
I just figured it out...

393
00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:37.746
I know who killed Chikako-san!

394
00:24:39.256 --> 00:24:40.796
On the next Conan--

395
00:24:40.796 --> 00:24:44.816
"The Mountain Lodge Bandage
Man Murder Case (Part 2)."

396
00:25:06.442 --> 00:25:08.782
Next Conan's Hint:

397
00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:08.789
Next Conan's Hint:
Piano wires.

398
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:10.558
Piano wires.
