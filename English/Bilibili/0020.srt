1
00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:05.895
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.065
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:11.895
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:14.895
Today's case takes place
in a haunted house!

5
00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:18.355
Even if it's hidden in an eerie basement,
there's always only one truth!

6
00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:56.365
The Haunted House Murder.

7
00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.895
Come ghost hunting with us, Conan-kun!

8
00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:41.655
Ghost hunting?

9
00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.155
Forget about him, Ayumi!

10
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:46.365
Conan wouldn't be any help
even if he did come!

11
00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.985
But if it's just you and me who go...

12
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:52.655
Where are these ghosts, anyway?

13
00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:54.695
An old mansion over on 4th Street!

14
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:55.705
4th Street?

15
00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:57.195
Yeah!

16
00:02:57.195 --> 00:02:58.985
People call it a horror mansion

17
00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:02.545
because a man was beaten
to death there 5 years ago!

18
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:10.195
Come to think of it,

19
00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:12.805
I do remember a mysterious
incident occurring there...

20
00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:16.525
They say that after his wife
and son moved out,

21
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.985
evil spirits took up
residence in the house!

22
00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:20.115
Evil spirits?

23
00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:23.405
Late at night, people've heard
horrible moaning coming from inside,

24
00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.905
stray dogs that wander inside
are found as skeletons the next day,

25
00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:35.285
and then last night, I saw a
spirit ball in one of the windows!

26
00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:40.065
Well? Doesn't it make you excited?!

27
00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.205
That's nothing but nonsense.

28
00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:46.235
In this scientific day and age,
ghosts and monsters should be left

29
00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:48.625
to television and comic books.

30
00:03:48.985 --> 00:03:52.735
What? Are you calling Ayumi a liar?!

31
00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:54.845
No, I'm just--

32
00:03:55.365 --> 00:04:01.185
Then come with us and prove
that there aren't any ghosts!

33
00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.485
After all, you shouldn't
be scared one bit!

34
00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:07.105
Eh? Me, come with you?

35
00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:11.775
You believe me, don't you, Conan-kun?

36
00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:13.065
Don't you?!

37
00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:13.775
Yeah...

38
00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:15.275
Okay, then!

39
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:18.315
Let's get ourselves ready
and then beat up some ghosts!

40
00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.205
Yeah!

41
00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:21.165
Are they being serious?!

42
00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:38.345
Let's all look at what we brought!

43
00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.945
I brought a metal ghost-hunting bat!

44
00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:44.225
I brought snacks for when we're hungry!

45
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:49.695
I brought flashlights for everyone
and a compass so we don't get lost.

46
00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:51.565
How about you, Conan-kun?

47
00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:54.365
I didn't really bring anything...

48
00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.945
It's your own fault if you die!

49
00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:58.285
Yeah! You'll get killed
if you're careless!

50
00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.485
I'll try hard not to die...

51
00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:05.245
Do these guys think they're entering
a devil's castle or something?

52
00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:08.695
Hey, this gate won't open...

53
00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:09.905
Don't worry.

54
00:05:09.905 --> 00:05:15.675
I found a secret entrance
when I scouted out the place earlier!

55
00:05:16.235 --> 00:05:18.175
A secret entrance?

56
00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:24.145
Hey! Here it is!

57
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:26.315
It's hidden by the grass,

58
00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:29.315
but it's just big enough
for someone to go through! See?

59
00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:30.815
Amazing, Genta-kun!

60
00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:35.365
A secret entrance...

61
00:05:35.365 --> 00:05:37.095
Conan-kun! Hurry up!

62
00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.115
Right...

63
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:41.475
It's open!

64
00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:45.445
It's too dark to see anything...

65
00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.035
It certainly is creepy...

66
00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:50.025
Hey... maybe we should go home...

67
00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.235
See, it's even starting to rain...

68
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:55.525
Don't be stupid! We didn't
come this far for nothing!

69
00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:57.945
You can go home by yourself if you want!

70
00:05:57.945 --> 00:05:59.005
You can't be serious!

71
00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:07.775
Lightning!

72
00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:09.025
Ayumi!

73
00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:23.785
Look closer! It's just
a sculpture of a demon!

74
00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:28.365
Aw, man! All I did was fall,
but now my arms and legs are all dirty!

75
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:32.755
Nobody's been here for a long time,
so the floor's covered with dust...

76
00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:35.965
Here's a washroom!

77
00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:38.675
Lucky!

78
00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:43.525
Walking around with you guys like this,

79
00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.735
it's almost like we're
in a role-playing game!

80
00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:47.855
Yeah! We're in a party!

81
00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:49.895
I'm a brave fighter, of course!

82
00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:52.235
I'm a cute girl warrior!

83
00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:54.565
I'm a gifted magician!

84
00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:55.815
I guess I'm a--

85
00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.115
You're a villager!

86
00:06:58.115 --> 00:07:00.905
But villagers aren't party members!

87
00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:03.775
But you're an important character--
you give us information!

88
00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:05.455
Yeah! It's the perfect role for you!

89
00:07:06.065 --> 00:07:08.615
Bah! Don't patronize me!

90
00:07:14.775 --> 00:07:18.295
What's the deal, you guys? Hiding
behind the villager, are you?

91
00:07:18.775 --> 00:07:20.895
Get moving, villager!

92
00:07:20.895 --> 00:07:22.255
Conan-kun! You can do it!

93
00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:39.355
I see. The door opened
by itself because of the wind.

94
00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:43.115
This is what most "ghosts"
turn out to be.

95
00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:46.655
You almost sound like a detective,
Mitsuhiko-kun!

96
00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:50.815
You guys wait here--
I need to use the restroom.

97
00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:52.315
Will you be alright by yourself?

98
00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:55.205
Of course! I have science
and logic on my side!

99
00:07:56.155 --> 00:07:58.695
Man, this house sure is huge!

100
00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:01.175
A really rich person
must've lived here!

101
00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:20.025
Ghosts can't possibly exist
in this scientific day and age!

102
00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:23.815
That was probably the sound of wind
blowing through a small hole

103
00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:26.155
or something...

104
00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:29.785
Alright! I'll check for myself!

105
00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:34.955
These stairs go into the basement...

106
00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:38.615
Those sounds are coming
from down there...

107
00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:39.925
Alright, then...

108
00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:42.525
Mitsuhiko-kun's taking a long time...

109
00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:44.315
It's been twenty minutes...

110
00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.845
Maybe he's going Number 2!

111
00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.775
The sound's getting louder...

112
00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:55.765
It's coming from that room!

113
00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:08.905
That was Mitsuhiko's voice!

114
00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:10.955
Wait, Conan-kun!

115
00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.915
There really is something
in this mansion!

116
00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:17.485
Hey, Mitsuhiko! Where are you?!

117
00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:20.735
Say something! Mitsuhiko-kun!

118
00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:22.775
Hey!

119
00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:25.115
Where could he have gone?!

120
00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:26.595
He wasn't in the bathroom, either...

121
00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:29.405
That scream was no joke!

122
00:09:29.405 --> 00:09:31.735
Something must've
happened to Mitsuhiko!

123
00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:33.015
Alright, then...

124
00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:36.615
You two hide in a nearby room!

125
00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:38.565
I'm going to look for Mitsuhiko!

126
00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:40.905
Listen to me! Don't leave
the room, no matter what!

127
00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:42.165
Hey! Conan!

128
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.315
Conan-kun!

129
00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:45.155
Something's not right!

130
00:09:45.155 --> 00:09:48.405
Supposedly no one's lived
here ever since the murder,

131
00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:51.115
so why isn't the water turned off?!

132
00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:54.065
There's also that room
with the open window!

133
00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:56.835
The room hadn't been damaged
by wind or rain at all!

134
00:09:56.835 --> 00:10:00.795
That means the window must've
been opened fairly recently!

135
00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:05.255
And then there's that secret entrance
that was built out of plain view!

136
00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:08.615
Someone's been coming into
and leaving this mansion!

137
00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:09.925
But who?!

138
00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:11.885
And what for?!

139
00:10:16.775 --> 00:10:19.695
Our moms must be worrying
about us right about now...

140
00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:21.935
It's already night outside...

141
00:10:22.195 --> 00:10:25.405
Conan sure is taking a long time...

142
00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:27.365
These aren't for you!

143
00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:31.985
Mitsuhiko-kun is probably
lost and hungry!

144
00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:33.325
Conan-kun too...

145
00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:36.525
These are for them! You can't have them!

146
00:10:36.525 --> 00:10:37.785
Fine...

147
00:10:42.065 --> 00:10:44.015
I smell food!

148
00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:46.815
It's coming from down there...

149
00:10:46.815 --> 00:10:48.495
I'm gonna check it out!

150
00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:52.155
No! Conan-kun said not to leave!

151
00:10:52.155 --> 00:10:53.265
I'll be right back!

152
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.225
Genta-kun!

153
00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:02.485
That's strange! There're no signs
of anybody anywhere!

154
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:04.185
Maybe there's really nobody here?!

155
00:11:08.985 --> 00:11:10.115
A photograph...

156
00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:14.945
Is this the mansion's owner
who was killed 5 years ago?

157
00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:18.075
And is that his wife
and son behind him?

158
00:11:18.485 --> 00:11:21.315
I thought that the killer
was never caught,

159
00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:24.495
and that the remaining
family members moved away...

160
00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:29.275
That was Genta's voice!

161
00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:31.595
Dammit! I told him to hide!

162
00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:38.515
Genta-kun? What's the matter?
Did something happen?

163
00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:46.025
Genta-kun! Stop trying to scare me!

164
00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:51.485
Wait! Those aren't Genta-kun's footsteps!

165
00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:54.405
Then whose are they?!

166
00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:07.065
Conan-kun!

167
00:12:07.065 --> 00:12:08.215
Don't make any sounds!

168
00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:14.345
Here they come!

169
00:12:58.446 --> 00:13:00.406
It's a ghost!

170
00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:02.816
No, look closer! It's a person!

171
00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:05.026
They're just taking something somewhere!

172
00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:06.136
But where to?!

173
00:13:09.986 --> 00:13:11.566
Wait, Conan-kun!

174
00:13:16.736 --> 00:13:17.816
They're gone!

175
00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:22.526
There aren't any rooms around here,

176
00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:23.946
...and straight ahead is a dead-end!

177
00:13:24.526 --> 00:13:26.196
So where did that person disappear to?!

178
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.326
I told you it was a ghost!

179
00:13:31.696 --> 00:13:34.526
The dust on the floor has a line in it!

180
00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:36.256
Wait a second! Maybe this is a--

181
00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:39.696
There's a door here.

182
00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:42.386
Yeah! That person just now
went down through it!

183
00:13:47.856 --> 00:13:50.976
No good! It's too much
for a kid to open!

184
00:13:51.356 --> 00:13:52.436
I know!

185
00:13:52.436 --> 00:13:55.406
I call these Retractable Suspenders.

186
00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:58.856
One push of a button and they retract
from their stretched-out state.

187
00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:01.906
They should work great
for tying up criminals!

188
00:14:02.196 --> 00:14:04.696
Yeah! I'll try using these!

189
00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:06.316
What are you going to do with them?

190
00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:07.866
Just watch and see!

191
00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:20.626
Awesome!

192
00:14:21.066 --> 00:14:23.026
A staircase to the basement!

193
00:14:23.026 --> 00:14:25.346
Maybe Mitsuhiko and Genta are down here!

194
00:14:34.986 --> 00:14:35.726
I see light!

195
00:14:51.196 --> 00:14:52.606
A prison cell!

196
00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:55.196
What's it doing here?!

197
00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:58.876
There's someone in there!
Look, on the bed!

198
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.856
Who is this guy?!

199
00:15:10.106 --> 00:15:11.096
Someone's coming!

200
00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:27.236
Another bad dream?

201
00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:28.486
You poor thing...

202
00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:33.456
But that was over 5 years ago--
forget about it already!

203
00:15:33.986 --> 00:15:38.626
No matter how much you suffer,
it still won't bring him back to life...

204
00:15:38.906 --> 00:15:40.566
Back to life?!

205
00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:44.086
Could she be referring to the
murdered owner of this house?!

206
00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:48.046
If so, then these two people are--

207
00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.476
Eat up.

208
00:16:00.736 --> 00:16:06.656
I'm not keeping you locked up
down here to make you suffer, you know!

209
00:16:06.656 --> 00:16:10.236
Akio! I'm doing this so
that you'll have a future!

210
00:16:10.816 --> 00:16:16.456
Aha, now I see the truth behind
this mansion and that murder!

211
00:16:33.306 --> 00:16:39.266
It sounds like we have some more rats
that snuck in with the other two...

212
00:16:39.526 --> 00:16:43.226
Show yourself.
There's no point in hiding!

213
00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:44.606
Come out!

214
00:16:45.856 --> 00:16:47.276
No point in hiding...

215
00:16:47.856 --> 00:16:50.406
You're the one who should
come out of hiding, ma'am!

216
00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:53.566
I found it in the study earlier...

217
00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:56.656
The photograph of you
and this house's owner,

218
00:16:56.656 --> 00:16:58.866
who was murdered 5 years ago.

219
00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:04.196
His appearance has drastically changed
in the 5 years he's lived down here,

220
00:17:04.196 --> 00:17:07.736
but the man standing next to
you in the picture is your son--

221
00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.256
the man in that prison cell!

222
00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:13.216
The mole below his eye was the
only thing that couldn't change.

223
00:17:13.656 --> 00:17:17.806
I thought something was strange
when I first entered the house.

224
00:17:18.066 --> 00:17:22.526
The family moved out so the
mansion should've been empty,

225
00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:23.736
but there was still running water.

226
00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:30.986
After all, nobody is so frivolous
as to continually pay the water bill

227
00:17:30.986 --> 00:17:32.366
for a house that no one lives in.

228
00:17:32.906 --> 00:17:36.986
And then there's that
discretely placed entrance.

229
00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:39.066
Compared to the age
of the surrounding walls,

230
00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:41.946
that wooden door was still new.

231
00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:45.316
My guess is that it was
built after the incident...

232
00:17:45.316 --> 00:17:48.696
...so that you could enter and leave
the mansion without being seen.

233
00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:53.196
But as for why it was necessary
to make the place look uninhabited,

234
00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:57.516
and why you needed to keep your son
locked up in the basement...

235
00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:02.316
...those questions were answered
by your conversation just now!

236
00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:04.936
Who are you?!

237
00:18:06.156 --> 00:18:08.936
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

238
00:18:09.316 --> 00:18:11.196
A detective?!

239
00:18:11.566 --> 00:18:15.196
There are two possibilities
that I can think of.

240
00:18:15.196 --> 00:18:18.526
The first is that the house's owner
was killed by you, his wife,

241
00:18:18.526 --> 00:18:21.666
and that you locked your son up
because he witnessed the murder.

242
00:18:22.196 --> 00:18:27.946
The second possibility is that it
was your son who killed your husband!

243
00:18:27.946 --> 00:18:29.656
Knowing that he was the killer,

244
00:18:29.656 --> 00:18:33.906
you decided to protect your son
by hiding the truth behind the murder.

245
00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:36.426
But the weight of what he had
done was too much for him.

246
00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:42.156
The moans coming from this mansion
were probably his deranged screams.

247
00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:47.396
Your son probably wanted to turn
himself in to atone for his crime.

248
00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:50.356
But you couldn't allow that to happen.

249
00:18:50.656 --> 00:18:54.946
Try to understand!
This is all for your sake!

250
00:18:56.656 --> 00:19:01.236
Yes. You didn't want your son
to be known as a criminal,

251
00:19:01.236 --> 00:19:05.006
so you chose to keep him concealed
here in absolute confinement.

252
00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:09.456
Judging from your conversation
just now and from your reaction,

253
00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:11.796
your husband's killer must have been--

254
00:19:11.796 --> 00:19:14.536
Shut up!

255
00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:18.676
Stop!

256
00:19:20.566 --> 00:19:24.316
Stop, Mom! He's exactly right!

257
00:19:24.316 --> 00:19:28.566
That's right! I was
the one who killed Dad!

258
00:19:32.196 --> 00:19:33.526
Akio!

259
00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.736
It happened on a spring night
5 years ago...

260
00:19:36.736 --> 00:19:39.986
I had just failed my
third college entrance exam...

261
00:19:40.986 --> 00:19:43.706
What? You failed another one?!

262
00:19:44.736 --> 00:19:46.666
You're an embarrassment to your family!

263
00:19:47.446 --> 00:19:50.086
You're pathetic!
You're a waste of a person!

264
00:19:50.526 --> 00:19:52.506
I was already very mentally anguished,

265
00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:55.006
so when I heard those words
come from my father...

266
00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:57.466
...I lost control of myself
for a split second!

267
00:19:58.196 --> 00:19:59.386
Akio!

268
00:20:00.026 --> 00:20:04.476
When I came to, I was holding a
blood-smeared candlestick in my hands,

269
00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:08.436
and my father was lying there
on the floor, nearly unrecognizable!

270
00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:13.026
Don't you worry! I'll protect you!

271
00:20:13.026 --> 00:20:14.396
Mom!

272
00:20:15.026 --> 00:20:17.946
The rest was just as you said.

273
00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:20.526
My mom made it look
like a robber killed him

274
00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:23.116
and then she stuck me in this cell.

275
00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:27.856
But I can't stand it any longer!
I can't live like this anymore,

276
00:20:27.856 --> 00:20:31.196
constantly haunted by
the murder of my own father!

277
00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.656
I want to confess my crime
so I can live with myself!

278
00:20:33.656 --> 00:20:35.466
Get a hold of yourself, Akio!

279
00:20:35.906 --> 00:20:38.906
Hang in there until the
statute of limitations runs out!

280
00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:42.636
If we keep quiet, nobody will ever know!

281
00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:47.726
Yes, if you remain in hiding like this,
you will be able to escape the police.

282
00:20:48.106 --> 00:20:51.106
But you'll never escape from the guilt!

283
00:20:52.486 --> 00:20:53.566
Ma'am.

284
00:20:53.566 --> 00:20:56.316
Do you intend to keep this
heavy weight on your son

285
00:20:56.316 --> 00:20:57.776
for the rest of his life?

286
00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:16.486
The night of terror came to an end,

287
00:21:16.486 --> 00:21:19.086
and bright sunlight lit up the mansion.

288
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.446
The two who disappeared during the night

289
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:24.816
were found sleeping amiably
in the grass outside.

290
00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.986
Apparently the woman had put them
to sleep with an anesthetic

291
00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:30.556
and threw them out of the house.

292
00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:34.976
That same day, the son and wife turned
themselves in to the authorities,

293
00:21:34.976 --> 00:21:39.566
and a baffling murder case came
to an end after 5 long years.

294
00:21:40.696 --> 00:21:44.906
Naturally, the four of us
were scolded by the grownups...

295
00:21:45.196 --> 00:21:48.986
I sure wish I was back in my normal body.

296
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:25.716
Another haunted house?!

297
00:23:25.716 --> 00:23:28.606
Yeah! Ayumi found another one!

298
00:23:28.606 --> 00:23:31.276
This one's on 2nd Street,
and it belonged to the Eto family!

299
00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.056
Eto?

300
00:23:32.486 --> 00:23:37.816
People living in the area say it's a
spooky mansion filled with weird books,

301
00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:41.986
and a boy who used to live there
by himself was eaten by some monsters!

302
00:23:42.606 --> 00:23:46.406
A boy who lived by himself in a
spooky mansion filled with books?

303
00:23:46.406 --> 00:23:48.946
2nd Street? Eto?

304
00:23:49.316 --> 00:23:52.316
Say, are you sure the name was Eto?

305
00:23:52.316 --> 00:23:55.666
Yeah! You write it with a
katakana "E" and a kanji "TO"!

306
00:23:58.126 --> 00:24:02.156
Okay! Let's get ready
to beat up some more ghosts!

307
00:24:03.606 --> 00:24:07.066
Wait! That's not "Eto"! That's "Kudo"!

308
00:24:07.066 --> 00:24:08.656
That's my house!

309
00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:10.816
Let's go, villager!
Let's go, villager!

310
00:24:19.486 --> 00:24:20.816
He's dead!

311
00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:22.356
We need to contact the police!

312
00:24:23.356 --> 00:24:26.316
This is the knife
they used during filming!

313
00:24:26.946 --> 00:24:30.826
Which means the killer
was someone on the staff!

314
00:24:30.826 --> 00:24:33.276
That's it!

315
00:24:33.276 --> 00:24:36.326
Now I know the truth
behind this incident!

316
00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:38.356
On the next Conan--

317
00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:41.196

318
00:24:57.982 --> 00:25:00.446
Next Conan's Hint:

319
00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:00.453
Next Conan's Hint:
Fu dog.

320
00:25:00.453 --> 00:25:02.355
Fu dog.
