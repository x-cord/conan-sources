1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:06,806
Oh, no. What have I done?

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,009
This is beyond just being careless.

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,119
Usually, I would've shouted for Ran to get it,

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,920
and things will be fine.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,125
But right now,
Yoko Okino is at my detective agency.

6
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,929
Even if my mouth is forced open,

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,232
there's no way I can say it.

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,503
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

9
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,304
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

10
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,806
An SOS signal from a locked room.

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,008
The truth of the incident is shown
by the playing cards.

12
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,612
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,814
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,022
"Yoko Okino And The Locked Room In The Attic
(Part 1)"

16
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,926
There's no way I can say it.

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,531
I can't say that we've run out of toilet paper!

18
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,100
That's it! I should use the phone.

19
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,804
If I can talk to Ran over the phone,

20
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,060
I shouldn't have to shout for it.

21
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,808
Hold on.

22
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,211
But if I'm not careful...

23
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,812
What?

24
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,715
There's no toilet paper,
so I should get you some?

25
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,918
Can't you shout more loudly?

26
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,750
Should I text her instead?

27
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,724
Huh? It's a text from Dad.

28
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,090
Mr. Kogoro's in the toilet, isn't he?

29
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,330
He said there was no toilet paper.

30
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,404
I can't. I have a bad feeling about this.

31
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,906
Now that it's come to this,

32
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:32,912
I can only ask
the clever but cheeky kid in glasses.

33
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,117
At this time,
Uncle Kogoro had no way of knowing

34
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:42,422
that this decision would guide him
to solve a difficult case.

35
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,825
(Two hours ago)

36
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,827
Hey, Dad.

37
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,429
Have you seen the buttercream sandwiches?

38
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,690
I put them in the fridge...

39
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,850
Buttercream sandwiches?
This is the last one.

40
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,000
What? You ate them?

41
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,507
Well, I was getting a bit hungry.

42
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,809
Was I not supposed to?

43
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,511
You weren't!

44
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,260
They were two days past the expiration date.

45
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,318
I should've thrown them out sooner.

46
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm sorry, Dad.

47
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,625
Don't worry about it!

48
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,027
Two days aren't going to make a difference.

49
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,170
Huh?

50
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,231
Dad would've nagged me about it by now.

51
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,500
Besides...

52
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,904
His desk is all nice and tidy.

53
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,900
And he's dressing up a little.

54
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,611
Could it be that he's cheating?

55
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,516
I think it's because of a client.

56
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,817
A client?

57
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:50,023
Uncle Kogoro is a huge fan of
the person who's coming.

58
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,826
Excuse me.

59
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,320
Thanks for your patience,

60
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,600
Yoko Okino!

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,201
It's okay.

62
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,303
Come on in.

63
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,506
Are you here by yourself?

64
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,607
Yes.

65
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:12,412
My manager suggested that
I don't get involved any more than I have,

66
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,514
but I couldn't help worrying about it.

67
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,217
That's why I came without him knowing.

68
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,219
I'm not used to going places by myself,

69
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,522
so I got lost and panicked.

70
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,725
Well, at least things worked out.

71
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,929
- Sorry?
- I mean, I'm glad you've made it.

72
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,970
Is black tea fine with you?

73
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,350
Sure.

74
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,002
Ran, go and make some.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,203
Okay.

76
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,107
So, it was at a vacation home in Karuizawa

77
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,009
while location scouting for a TV drama.

78
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,500
Were you there
because you're the main actress?

79
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,515
Yes. I was with the producer.

80
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,317
I said we were location scouting,

81
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,020
but really, we had to
choose between a few places.

82
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,522
We were just having a look in advance.

83
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,970
It was my first time in a dark role,
so I was excited.

84
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,131
What kind of role is it?

85
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm playing a ghost
that lives at the vacation home.

86
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,206
But you said in an interview

87
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,108
that your next role is as a detective.

88
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,810
The ghost is the detective.

89
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,013
Long ago,
the owner of the holiday home was killed,

90
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,715
and she now appears as a ghost every night.

91
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,016
In exchange for solving mysteries

92
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,519
that people who come to
the holiday home have,

93
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,224
she asks them to find
each of her scattered bones.

94
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,226
I'm not going to be able to watch that.

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,630
But there aren't any holiday homes
that fit the story.

96
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,620
That's when the producer, Wanya Heijima,
suggested to me...

97
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,004
( Wanya Heijima (39) )
There's an eerie holiday home...

98
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,706
( Wanya Heijima (39) )
where a woman went missing in real life.

99
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,207
Want to check it out?

100
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,500
That's what he said.

101
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,711
"In real life..."

102
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,360
That hurts.

103
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,314
The holiday home

104
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,618
actually belongs to the family
that Heijima's sister married into.

105
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,622
The missing woman is his sister.

106
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:08,027
When I went there with Heijima,

107
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:13,800
I saw right away that the house
had a sinister aura around it.

108
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,407
I meant to go home on that day,

109
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,709
but I ended up staying for a night

110
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,600
because I wanted to have a look around.

111
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,960
Were you alone with the producer?

112
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,450
No.

113
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,519
It just so happened that

114
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,000
Heijima's brother-in-law, Nukiyasu Baba,

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,220
( Nukiyasu Baba (46) )
Heijima's brother-in-law, Nukiyasu Baba,

116
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,400
his brother Fugo,

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,220
( Fugo Baba (44) )
his brother Fugo,

118
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,820
and Fugo's wife Himi came to escape the summer heat.

119
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,490
( Himi Baba (43) )
and Fugo's wife Himi came to escape the summer heat.

120
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,103
Then, we all had dinner.

121
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,307
The incident happened around midnight

122
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,008
when I was about to fall asleep in bed.

123
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,815
That really hurts.

124
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,360
I thought I heard someone moaning,

125
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,823
but then I heard footsteps from the hallway.

126
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,025
I was concerned about it, so I went out.

127
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,429
And I found drops of blood in the hallway.

128
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,132
I followed the trail of blood
and turned a corner...

129
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,703
And I saw...

130
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,010
What's wrong, Ran?

131
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,750
Don't scare me like that.

132
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,715
But it came out!

133
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,718
The ghost of the woman who disappeared!

134
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,810
That wasn't it. The trail of blood stopped.

135
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,530
Nobody was there, either.

136
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:51,130
Was there a door or a window
anyone could have escaped to?

137
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,800
Yes. There was only the bathroom door.

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,650
Of course, I turned on the lights
and looked into the bathtub.

139
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,650
But nobody was there.

140
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,511
While I was looking around,
everyone gathered to where I was.

141
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,315
Apparently, they couldn't find Nukiyasu,
the older brother.

142
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,150
So we decided to split up and look for him.

143
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,720
I said "split up",

144
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,523
but I was the only one
who could walk normally.

145
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,725
So, we split into two groups.

146
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,480
Was everyone else injured, then?

147
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,132
I see. I forgot to mention it.

148
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,901
Fugo, the younger brother,
dislocated his left wrist,

149
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,303
so it was bandaged up.

150
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,105
Himi is in a wheelchair due to a hernia.

151
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:37,250
Heijima sprained his right leg
and was on crutches.

152
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,712
I thought it would be dangerous
for anyone to be left alone

153
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,710
if a bad guy was lurking around.

154
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,850
I see.

155
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:47,960
So you split into groups of two to
look for Nukiyasu. Is that right?

156
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,323
But just as we were about to look for him,

157
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:56,028
this strange picture was sent to
Fugo's phone by Nukiyasu.

158
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,112
But just as we were about to look for him,

159
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:18,818
this strange picture was sent to
Fugo's phone by Nukiyasu.

160
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,024
Playing cards?

161
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,270
Are they hands in poker or blackjack?

162
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,931
But some of the hands
have the same cards in them.

163
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,432
So, I don't think that's it.

164
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,901
You're right.

165
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,107
Was the younger brother unable to figure it out?

166
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,208
He wasn't.

167
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,360
So we all thought it over
while looking for Nukiyasu.

168
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,560
I asked to have a copy of the picture,

169
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,817
but no one figured it out in the end.

170
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,421
Did you try calling or texting Nukiyasu?

171
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,524
Yes. Fugo tried calling him a few times.

172
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,328
But there was always a message saying
the phone was turned off.

173
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,930
Did you try looking outside the holiday home?

174
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,501
We did. Fugo and I went around
since we were able to walk.

175
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,003
We also searched the forest next to it,

176
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,705
but we couldn't find him at all.

177
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,409
Heijima and I couldn't leave the family alone,

178
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,212
so we cancelled our work commitments
and stayed at the holiday home

179
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,960
to continue the search.

180
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,717
The fourth morning
after we started looking for Nukiyasu,

181
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,619
Fugo remembered that

182
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:31,670
he used to play cards
with his brother in the attic.

183
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,970
Why in the attic?

184
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,529
Apparently, their parents were so strict

185
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,831
that they wouldn't buy any toys
for the brothers growing up.

186
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,800
Whenever they were at the holiday home,

187
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,102
they would sneak into the attic

188
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,520
and play without their parents knowing.

189
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,208
Fugo thought that Nukiyasu
could be in the attic.

190
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:58,417
But the stairs leading up to the attic
were locked from the inside,

191
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,970
so we were unable to get up there.

192
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,670
When we called the police,

193
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,725
we asked them to break into
the attic through the window,

194
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,726
and when they went inside...

195
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:34,120
They found Nukiyasu dead
with an arrow stuck to his back!

196
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,622
Hold on a second.

197
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,824
When you said the police
broke in through the window,

198
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,170
is it because the window was locked?

199
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,450
Yes.

200
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,632
So that means this is...

201
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,300
It's a locked-room murder.

202
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,500
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

203
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,010
That's right.

204
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,412
I was just about to say it myself!

205
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:06,418
A crossbow was found on
the ground near the holiday home.

206
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:11,624
But things like how the culprit
locked Nukiyasu in the attic,

207
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,270
or what the strange deck of cards
sent to his brother meant.

208
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:22,810
Why didn't Fugo alert the police
when he received the picture?

209
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,504
There were so many puzzling things.

210
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,406
So, please, Detective Mouri!

211
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,708
Please solve this mystery!

212
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,615
I've been so worried that I can't sleep.

213
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,219
Just leave it to me.

214
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,222
I, Kogoro Mouri, swear on my reputation
as a great detective...

215
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,350
Is something the matter?

216
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,601
Nothing.

217
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,005
I need to go to the toilet.

218
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,310
Was it because of
the buttercream sandwiches?

219
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm sorry, but I heard
your conversation earlier.

220
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,050
A locked-room murder.

221
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,730
Doesn't that sound interesting?

222
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,900
I see.

223
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,702
The pop idol Yoko Okino

224
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,205
went to the holiday home of
her producer's acquaintances

225
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,200
while location hunting for a TV drama.

226
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:39,612
She heard a moan around midnight
while she was in bed.

227
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,000
There was also the sound of
footsteps in the hallway,

228
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,619
so she went out to find a trail of blood.

229
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,122
She followed the trail of blood
and turned a corner,

230
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,225
but the trail of blood stopped
and no one was there.

231
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,828
There was only the bathroom door.

232
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,520
Of course, no one was in the bathroom.

233
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,701
According to the others,

234
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,904
Nukiyasu, the older brother,
was nowhere to be found.

235
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,409
So everyone split up to look for him.

236
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,611
The fourth morning after the search began,

237
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,413
the younger brother remembered that

238
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,417
he used to play with his brother in the attic

239
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,620
and thought he might be there.

240
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,124
But the stairs to the attic
were locked from the inside,

241
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,626
so nobody could get in.

242
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,628
When they called the police

243
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,932
to break into the attic through the window,

244
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,900
they found the older brother's body,

245
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,900
stabbed in the back with a crossbow arrow.

246
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:42,708
This established that someone
committed a locked-room murder.

247
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,500
Well, that's what I heard. Was that right?

248
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,713
Yes.

249
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,816
Even though it's described
as a locked-room murder,

250
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,217
if you consider the trail of blood

251
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,320
and the sound of footsteps in the hallway,

252
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,523
it's clear that the older brother

253
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,926
was shot by the culprit with a crossbow
and ran up to the attic.

254
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:07,032
It means that you have to figure out
why he didn't call out for help

255
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,401
and locked himself up in the attic.

256
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,705
And right after the older brother disappeared,

257
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,307
when everyone was just about to look for him...

258
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,717
Why didn't he call the police
or ask someone for help,

259
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:30,750
but sent his brother a very strange picture?

260
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,600
So, excuse me, but who are you?

261
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,990
I forgot to introduce myself.

262
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,201
I work at Iroha Sushi next door.
The name's Wakita.

263
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,004
I got a call from Master Kogoro
last night at the restaurant.

264
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:50,909
He asked if I could prepare
an extra special bento box for two

265
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,313
full of the freshest ingredients
for this afternoon.

266
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,614
I see.

267
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,216
He was looking to have sushi with Yoko

268
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,918
if she happened to be hungry.

269
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,222
But he didn't call back this morning,

270
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,725
so I got tired of waiting
and brought it in myself.

271
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,826
But...

272
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,528
I won't take anything!

273
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,931
I'll pay for it out of my salary.

274
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,980
By the way, where's Master Kogoro?

275
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,004
He went to the toilet just now.

276
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,007
Let's all have sushi, then.

277
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,308
Right.

278
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,711
I love sushi!

279
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,560
It looks delicious!

280
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,718
I added an extra portion for free.

281
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,920
I'll make us some green tea, then.

282
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,930
I'm certain those buttercream sandwiches
are the reason.

283
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,733
They did taste weird.

284
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,802
Is it my imagination,

285
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,305
or is the office getting a bit lively?

286
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,307
It's yummy!

287
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,210
It really is. Right, Conan?

288
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,411
Yeah.

289
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,013
That's an extra special set for you!

290
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,716
The medium-fatty tuna has just enough fat
that makes it exquisite!

291
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,620
That's from bigeye tuna!
It's in season right now.

292
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,323
But Master Kogoro is sure taking his time.

293
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:18,130
We don't want to keep you waiting,
so let's hear the details.

294
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,632
In that case,
do you have pictures of the people

295
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,801
who stayed with you at the holiday home?

296
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,360
It's hard for me to imagine
from your description alone.

297
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,600
That's what I thought, too.

298
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,108
Wait a second.

299
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,511
I think I have a picture of everyone.

300
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,450
There it is!

301
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:40,018
This picture was taken when we arrived there.

302
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,523
I'm not in it since I was the one who took it.

303
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,826
Who's who?

304
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,027
Let's see...

305
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,331
The one on the left with the crutches

306
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,901
is Nichiuri TV producer Wanya Heijima.

307
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,905
The one in the middle
is Heijima's brother-in-law

308
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,208
and the murder victim Nukiyasu Baba.

309
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,311
The tall one on the right with his arm in a sling

310
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,615
is Nukiyasu's younger brother, Fugo Baba.

311
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:15,120
And the woman in the wheelchair
is Himi Baba, Fugo's wife.

312
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,570
Everyone aside from the older brother
seems to be injured in some way.

313
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,829
That's right. I think it's just a coincidence, though.

314
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,100
The playing cards shown in the picture

315
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,103
had a few of the same number.

316
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,905
Was it mentioned why?

317
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,106
Yes.

318
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,309
They often went to the holiday home as a family

319
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,712
to escape the summer heat
since they were children.

320
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:45,217
They used to hide decks of cards in the attic

321
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,819
instead of carrying them in their luggage

322
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,722
so that they could play
without their parents finding out.

323
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:55,427
Every time they went,
they would buy another deck just in case.

324
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,830
There seemed to be five or six decks in the attic.

325
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,700
I wonder what he was trying to tell

326
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,202
with the various decks of cards.

327
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:08,707
I bet it must've hurt
with a crossbow arrow stuck to his back.

328
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,210
Speaking of playing cards, the late Nukiyasu

329
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,513
had a strange nickname for his brother.

330
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,214
What was it?

331
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,700
"Ace".

332
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,519
What's the matter with that left arm, Ace?

333
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,921
I hurt it while playing baseball
over the weekend.

334
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,424
Was he a pitcher or something?

335
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,526
I thought the same, so I asked him about it.

336
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,827
But he laughed.

337
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,129
I've been a tall guy ever since I was a kid,

338
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,532
so I've always been a catcher.

339
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,060
But I've never been a pitcher in my life.

340
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,904
That's what he said.

341
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,508
There seems to be a key to
deciphering the deck of cards,

342
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,111
but I don't have a clue.

343
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:50,015
Then, what was Mr. Nukiyasu's late wife like?

344
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,719
Heijima's older sister, you mean?

345
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,120
I've never met her,

346
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,222
but when I told him
that I'm consulting Detective Mouri

347
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:01,727
about the incident, he sent me this picture.

348
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:07,070
The woman in sunglasses
is Heijima's older sister, Hoka Baba.

349
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,002
(Hoka Baba)
She disappeared two summers ago.

350
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,850
(Hoka Baba)
Nukiyasu wanted to go with her to the holiday home,

351
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,604
Nukiyasu wanted to go with her to the holiday home,

352
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,507
but something urgent came up.

353
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:19,311
She was supposed to
come there alone before him.

354
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:24,916
When he came with Fugo and Himi,
she wasn't there.

355
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,319
They called the police to
search for her,

356
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,321
but nobody could find her.

357
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,823
Did she often wear sunglasses?

358
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,127
Yes. Heijima said
she was obsessed with them

359
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,229
and often wore them
before she disappeared.

360
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,132
But Fugo and his wife said

361
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,803
they never saw her wearing sunglasses
while in university.

362
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,406
When you said, "while in university..."

363
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:52,110
That's right. The three of them
were in university together.

364
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,713
In fact, they were together
all throughout their school years as well.

365
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,615
Hoka was Fugo's first love,

366
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:01,019
and she and Himi were best friends.

367
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,222
I see. In that case...

368
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:10,829
If Nukiyasu was the cause of
his wife Hoka's disappearance,

369
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:16,310
then all three of them
have a motive for killing him.

370
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,327
Was there anything else
you were concerned about?

371
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,180
I can't. I have a bad feeling about this.

372
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,250
I can't believe it was all an act.

373
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,650
No. I think he understood it
but pretended not to.

374
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,808
There's no way I don't know!

375
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,912
Well, when something
that's supposed to be there isn't,

376
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,014
of course, you'd be concerned.

377
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,916
Next Conan,

378
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:14,920
"Yoko Okino And The Locked Room In The Attic
(Part 2)"

379
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,004
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,750
"Mahjong"

381
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,509
- Sushi is the best!
- I can't bite into the squid.

382
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,910
And I still don't have toilet paper!
