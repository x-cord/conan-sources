"Shoddy Construction at the Airport Village"

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,887
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

3
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:35,820
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,587
An unexpected trick transcending time and space that confuses Haibara.

5
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,187
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,987
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,574
His name is Detective Conan!

"Ai Haibara is Held in Captivity"

9
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:43,162
Haibara was nowhere to be found.

10
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:46,107
If she went shopping she would've been through long time ago.

11
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,061
I wonder what happened?

12
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,861
If something happened,

13
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,829
it had to have happened on her way back.

14
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:00,162
-Maybe she was run over? -No way!

15
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:02,594
I can't imagine that happened to Haibara.

16
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:08,174
A railway crossing accident?

17
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:09,961
No way!

18
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:27,341
-A muffler? -It's so small!

19
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,075
It has nothing to do with Haibara, does it?

20
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:31,295
No.

21
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:35,161
It belongs to the kitten that liked Haibara a lot.

22
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,307
How cute.

"Naoshi, Mitsuru Higaki"

00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:51,239
Midoridai. Midoridai. There are places where the space between...

25
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,894
What are you looking at kitty?

26
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:57,627
-It's a terrarium. -Is there something there?

27
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,228
It come out.

28
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:04,662
Oh! It's an Indian Star Turtle.

29
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,008
What a beautiful pattern.

30
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:11,274
Wasn't there an import restriction on it?

31
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:13,507
No need to worry.

32
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,027
"Mitsuru Higaki (38)" -I bought it at a legitimate shop.

33
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:18,908
What a surprise.

34
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:21,262
Chiro seems to like you a lot.

35
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,741
Hey, kitty!

36
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:32,328
-Chiro, where are you? -In here!

37
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:39,328
-It fell. -I'm glad we found her.

38
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,274
No one seems to be home.

39
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:51,561
We went out of our way to bring the cat back, and yet...

40
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:55,075
It seems Haibara's not here either.

41
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,762
The curtains are closed too.

42
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,300
What's up?

43
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,328
I wonder if it's hungry...

44
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:09,328
So, all we got is one kitten?

45
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:14,474
I wonder where Haibara went?

46
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,674
Maybe she was kidnapped?

47
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:20,008
"I got the girl, so bring the cash!" Like so.

48
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:24,996
If so... Maybe the culprit thought this house was loaded?

49
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:29,562
Okay, I got it. Thanks, Officer Chiba.

50
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,629
There haven't been any reports in this area from this morning.

51
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:39,061
I'm sure she'll try to contact us if anything came up.

52
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:43,708
Haibara, everybody's worried!

53
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:44,995
Contact us!

54
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,794
I wonder what happened to me.

55
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:55,994
Where am I?

56
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,262
It's already this late?

57
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,829
I've been asleep for 5 hours.

58
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:14,294
Indian Star Turtle.

59
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:16,828
It's Ms. Higaki's house.

60
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,161
That's right, I...

61
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,928
Chiro?

62
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:39,708
Your muffler got stuck,

63
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:42,662
I'll remove it for you right away.

64
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,161
See. Stay still.

65
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,028
Ma'am?

66
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,728
Midoridai, Midoridai.

67
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:24,529

00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,660
Higaki? Don't tell me that...

71
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,195
I've got to calm down.

72
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,794
I've got to pull free somehow!

73
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,494
Thank you for the meal.

74
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,961
I'm full. I'm really full.

75
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,761
Why don't we try going over to the Higaki residence once more with her?

76
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,008
Nobody was there, you know.

77
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,174
Maybe they came home already, right?

78
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:01,641
True, it's better than just staying here.

79
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,528
-Let's go! -Yes.

80
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,695
It came off!

81
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,261
Help!

82
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:22,161
The culprit's still here!

83
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:52,820
Nobody's home after all?

84
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,219
What?

85
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,554
Yeah. I rang the bell six times but no answer.

86
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:06,087
Give me a break. Mrs. Higaki told me to come at this time and yet...

87
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:07,700
I've got no choice.

88
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,899
Can you tell her that I'll be back later, Chiro.

89
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,052
See you.

90
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,854
He tells the cat to relay the message and left.

91
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:20,520
It's Officer Chiba!

92
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:24,266
Oh, just a while ago

93
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,136
we got a lost and found that may be of some concern

94
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29,336
from the police box on Airport Blvd.

95
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,954
The Youth Detective Squad badge?

96
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:36,986
Right, a truck driver who was fixing a flat tyre in the area picked it up

97
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,086
and turned it in.

98
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:47,588
Everybody's worried!

99
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,654
Contact us!

100
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,554
"The Youth Detective Squad"

101
00:09:56,453 --> 00:10:00,367
It's pretty far. We've been driving for about an hour already.

102
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,421
Accurately, it's been 50 minutes!

103
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,500
It's the police box near the intersection of Airport Blvd.

104
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,100
We'll get there in about two or three minutes.

105
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,554
You mean she came this far? Haibara?

106
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,987
It's quite unthinkable.

107
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:21,667
It's near the airport and yet a new residential district's been built.

108
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,433
Seems like the selling point are convenience and complete sound proof.

109
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:27,880
There's the police box!

110
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,024
"The Airport Village"

111
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,381
What a big sign.

112
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:34,288
Practically all of them seems to have been sold.

113
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:35,754
This is it.

114
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,620
No doubt about, it's Ai's!

115
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:42,999
I'm sure that she was kidnapped and threw this out along the way!

116
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,467
To let us know where she is!

117
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:49,521
But we haven't even been contacted by the culprit yet,

118
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:52,854
so it's too early to conclude that this is a kidnapping case.

119
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:13,822
This is the key for the handcuffs?

120
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,220
Ma'am. Is the culprit here?

121
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,754
Is this the key for the handcuffs?

122
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:25,086
Ma'am, can you bend down?

123
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,387
Stay still okay?

124
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:52,920
Thank you, Ai. I'll untie you right away.

125
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,020
Police. Is anybody home?

126
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,421
This is the Mitsuru Higaki residence, isn't it?

127
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:12,720
What's wrong?

128
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:24,353
The fact is I'm here to check on things here on request of the HPD.

129
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,233
It's been quite a misfortune, hasn't it?

130
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,767
No, never mind me, but my husband, Naoshi...

131
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:32,454
Has the culprit who killed my husband been arrested?

132
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,886
No, unfortunately.

133
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:39,553
An investigator is heading over here from Hokkaido regarding this.

134
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:43,033
I don't know anything.

135
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,887
I was tied up right through in this house, you see.

136
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:50,620
Well, all I want to ask you is about Mr. Higaki's acquaintances.

137
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:54,154
Yes, if it's about that.

138
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:57,433
Talk about unlucky.

139
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,367
Are you feeling better?

140
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,921
Yes, but I'm sorry to have worried all of you.

141
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:06,899
No, it's great that you're safe.

142
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,266
Some shopping experience it was.

143
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,320
Is this a coincidence?

144
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,754
The lady really went through a terrible coincidence.

145
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:19,567
To think that her husband was killed while the house was being robbed.

146
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:23,388
Yes. I found out about the case on TV.

147
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,600
But, I couldn't move at all.

148
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,887
Just like Ai over there.

149
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:31,200
-Haibara. -What?

150
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,188
You said a terrible coincidence, right?

151
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,633
Do you really think so? You think that all that's a coincidence?

152
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:39,920
What?

153
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,354
Why did the robber do what the robber did to you back then?

154
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,400
If left as it is, people would've thought the resident wasn't home.

155
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,054
Besides, why were you put to sleep twice?

156
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,800
Did the robber stay that long in this house?

157
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,300
The robber was having trouble opening the safe.

158
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,420
-She's the one who said that, right? -Right.

159
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:12,954
When you were put to sleep the second time, what was she doing?

160
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,386
What?

161
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:19,121
I'm asking if you saw the robber and that lady at the same time.

162
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,620
Help!

163
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,453
The culprit's still here!

164
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:27,866
I couldn't have.

165
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,166
I was covered with a towel from right behind me

166
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:32,866
and my vision was blocked right away.

167
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:35,986
More so, I didn't have the composure to be worried about anybody else.

168
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,420
Not even a tinge! Don't tell me you think that lady is...

169
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,754
You suspect that she's playing both of the role, don't you, Edogawa?

170
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:50,419
-What? -That's ridiculous.

171
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:54,354
But why would she do something like that?

172
00:14:54,687 --> 00:15:00,121
Maybe she used me to establish her alibi for murder.

173
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:03,667
Robber and murder.

174
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:06,633
Haibara got messed up in it.

175
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:11,354
Maybe it was no coincidence, but actually a put-up-job.

176
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,500
Are you saying Chiro was used to set me up as a witness for her alibi?

177
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,633
If she made a round trip to Hokkaido

178
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,920
after putting you to sleep, she wouldn't be suspected.

179
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:27,433
-What if she set up a plan like that? -It can't be.

180
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,700
Because she couldn't have committed the crime.

181
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,587
It's only an hour and a half if you take a direct flight to Shin-Chitose.

182
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,487
From here to the airport. Just how long does it take?

183
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:43,276
If you take a car from here, it's an hour,

184
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,700
so all together it would take about two hours and a half!

185
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,533
If it's two hours and a half one way, then a round trip would take...

186
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:51,920
Five hours!

187
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,274
The time she had to wait for the victim to come to the airport

188
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:59,219
and time to kill him would also have to be calculated.

189
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,866
It would take at least five hours and a half.

190
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,186
No, but...

191
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,720
After I woke up, I saw the lady a little after 14:00.

192
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,667
I was only asleep at most only for five hours.

193
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:21,954
It also bothers me that your badge was found on Airport Blvd.

194
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,587
That's right, the door chime!

195
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,521
Somebody came to the door and rang the door chime.

196
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,488
It was about 14:30!

197
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:41,787
It came off!

198
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,899
It's back then!

199
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,353
Right, the liquor delivery!

200
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,521
Nobody's home after all?

201
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,186
What?

202
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,600
Yeah. I rang the bell six times but no answer.

203
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,800
Wait! Six times? I heard only two times.

204
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,467
And not successively but slowly!

205
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,188
What?

206
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,620
Just as I thought!

207
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:21,400
What do you mean?

208
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,666
The door chime and station announcement were all recording

209
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:26,800
that the culprit had set up beforehand.

210
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
If so, everything falls into place!

211
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:34,087
I sort of get the idea of what you're thinking now, Edogawa.

212
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:38,453
You think that there were two Higaki residences, right?

213
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:41,655
What?

214
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,300
What're you talking about?

215
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,667
I see.

216
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:48,274
There's not enough time because we're thinking a round trip

217
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,800
from here to Hokkaido was made.

218
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,267
But, if the place where Haibara woke up

219
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,587
was at another house near the airport then...

220
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,933
You mean the place that was on the sign!

221
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,133
The Airport Village near the airport?

222
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:05,754
If Ai was held captive in one of those houses, then...

223
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,467
The time to go to the airport won't have be considered!

224
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:11,754
It's two hours saved!

225
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:13,270
The explanation to the trick of giving the impression that

226
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:16,320
two houses seemed to be one is the turtle.

227
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:19,053
Because you can take the terrarium along!

228
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,933
At the same time that the liquor delivery man was asked to come,

229
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:25,453
the recorded chime is rung at the fake house!

230
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:31,254
I was put to sleep two times so that she could move me and the turtle.

231
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:36,700
But, how can you prove that there were two houses?

232
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,487
This is a big place.

233
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,999
The goal is right before our eyes! Can you remember anything else?

234
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,353
Well...

235
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,486
Chiro.

236
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,554
I'm glad I drank it all!

237
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:04,786
I wonder what that was.

238
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,320
The can that rolled turned to a different direction?

239
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,553
"Shoddy Construction at the Airport Village"

240
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,100
Yes. When I woke up again, that can didn't move at all.

241
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,721
I got it! That's got to be it!

242
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:29,100
Genta, lift up the edge of the table a bit, will you.

243
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,887
Okay.

244
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,354
-Like this? -Good. Watch.

245
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,319
See, it turned to another direction, right?

246
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:47,854
What does this have to do with Haibara's story?

247
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,866
This is what Edogawa's getting at!

248
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,467
"Plastic Bottles Roll Continuously Across the Floor"

249
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:55,354
The floor is like a slide.

250
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,533
We found out right away from the property developers list.

251
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,753
I'll send you the picture of this house.

252
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,420
It's true that you're unlucky.

253
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:19,474
To think that the house that you bought and renovated

254
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,854
was made under shoddy construction.

255
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:40,087
Was Officer Takagi at the Airport Village?

256
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:43,899
Shoddy construction is a crime, you see.

257
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,253
Officer Takagi just happened to be there.

258
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,455
Super good job, Youth Detective Squad!

259
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,587
Aye!

260
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,766
Her motive was really something plain and common,

261
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,987
a crime committed by an estranged wife.

262
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,933
Is that so?

263
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:30,887
Which means that she had her eyes on Ai to begin with?

264
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,734
Yes. It seems so.

265
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:34,766
Because Ai's intelligent and strong-willed.

266
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,533
She used to see Ai scold you a lot, Dr. Agasa,

267
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:40,987
and figured Ai may serve as a great witness.

268
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:45,353
I wonder if she used to scold me that much?

269
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:49,233
Well, will you please tell the members of the Youth Detective Squad

270
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:51,899
that the case was closed?

271
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:54,586
-Okay. -Bye, then.

272
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:02,420
Hey, Haibara.

273
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:06,288
What's up? Smiling like that?

274
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,520
Well...

275
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:12,286
-What? Tell me, tell me! -Well...

276
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,454
What? Really?

277
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,054
I'm glad!

278
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,533
-Shall we go then! -Yes!

279
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:22,987
Yes!

280
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,554
That Haibara is cheerfully laughing and running...

281
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,221
Hey!

282
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,187
-Wait! Tell me too! -It's a secret.

283
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,987
Hey, wait!

284
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:41,587
Seems like they found a foster home for Chiro and the turtle.

285
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:48,053
The owner maybe a culprit, but the pets aren't to blame for it.

286

"Next Episode"

287
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:58,420
Stay away! Stay back.

288
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,121
Cool it!

289
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:02,567
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

290
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:03,987
Darn!

291
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:10,822
This is a trace of sudden acceleration...

292
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:12,987
This is...

293
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:14,953
Just as I thought!

294
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,154
Next Conan, "A Troublesome Emergency Patient"

295
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,600

Thanks for everything.

298
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,633
I'd help you any day, anytime, Haibara.

299
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:45,920
Thank you...
