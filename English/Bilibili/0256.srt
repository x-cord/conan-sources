1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.440
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.440
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.640
The Matsue mystery is solved today.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.940
There are so many secrets in the lake.

5
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57.453 --> 00:01:59.753
"Matsue Castle"

9
00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.253
One autumn day,

10
00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:04.553
the three of us went on a trip to Matsue City in Shimane.

11
00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:06.753
At Matsue Lake Hotel, we meet a group of five people

12
00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:08.953
who have come to compose what is called linked verses group.

13
00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:10.953
The next day,

14
00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:14.253
one of their members, Mr. Gozo Ushikubo was found murdered

15
00:02:14.253 --> 00:02:17.353
on the Matsue Castle grounds.

16
00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:19.353
His index finger seems to be pointing to something

17
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:21.553
and we must find out what his dying message is.

18
00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:28.353
I'm absolutely positive one of those four killed him

19
00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:30.353
and we're going to find out at that poetry session!

20
00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:37.453
"The Linked Poetry Incident At Tamatsukuri In Matsue (Part 2)"

21
00:02:37.453 --> 00:02:41.453
"Tamatsukuri Spa" -Our haiku gathering will now begin.

22
00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:44.753
There will be a total of 14 poems this time

23
00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:46.753
for our linked verses composition.

24
00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:49.553
Also, to make it easier for Mr. Mouri who is a beginner,

25
00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:51.253
we'll do it with a word game style,

26
00:02:51.253 --> 00:02:53.553
using the last syllable of the previous word to start the new verse.

27
00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.453
A word game?

28
00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:56.453
Yes.

29
00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:58.453
There are only a few rules you have to follow.

30
00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:00.553
Other than that, it's pretty much anything goes.

31
00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:04.153
First, we start with a 5-7-5 poem for the opening

32
00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:09.653
then follow with a 7-7 poem, and another 5-7-5 and so forth.

33
00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:11.153
However, you have to be careful not to link your poem

34
00:03:11.153 --> 00:03:14.053
to the two poems before yours which is called "uchikoshi".

35
00:03:14.053 --> 00:03:16.953
After that, all you have to do is include the four seasons

36
00:03:16.953 --> 00:03:18.753
in some of the fourteen poems.

37
00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:20.853
In between, we'll include one poem referring to the moon,

38
00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:22.653
three love poems,

39
00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:24.953
the thirteenth poem will refer to flowers.

40
00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:26.453
And the closing poem will be a poem

41
00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:28.853
about Spring bringing it to a happy end.

42
00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:31.253
That's all you have to remember.

43
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.753
Sure.

44
00:03:32.753 --> 00:03:35.553
Hey, are you sure you can handle it?

45
00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:39.053
Well, let's just start and see.

46
00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:40.753
First is the opening poem.

47
00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.953
The poems you all wrote...

48
00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:44.553
Mr. Shiina's,

49
00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:48.053
"Even Gods will gather and gaze upon Deer's Window."

50
00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:49.553
Mr. Yagisawa's,

51
00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:53.453
"To the huge turtle, a mantis does raise its ax in reverence forsooth."

52
00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:54.853
Mizuki's,

53
00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:57.053
"Soft and gently where the sun shines upon

54
00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:58.953
the dancing autumn leaves."

55
00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:01.153
And now Mr. Ushikubo's poem,

56
00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:05.453
"Autumn surges, there's no sorrow in my life."

57
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.753
I think they are all good poems.

58
00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:10.353
But since this session is dedicated to Mr. Ushikubo,

59
00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:13.453
I'd like to use his poem as the opener.

60
00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.753
-Okay. -Okay.

61
00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.253
All right. Will someone continue for the "waki"?

62
00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:24.353
What is a "waki"?

63
00:04:24.353 --> 00:04:26.353
It's the second poem.

64
00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:29.553
Like hokku, it contains reference to the season.

65
00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:31.153
I'll go.

66
00:04:31.153 --> 00:04:34.953
Within the silence, I hear a nut falling from the tree.

67
00:04:36.153 --> 00:04:38.553
That's very good. You interpreted the opener very cleverly.

68
00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:41.253
All right. Why don't you go next, Mr Yagisawa?

69
00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:42.453
Okay.

70
00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:47.853
I wonder if dad will be able to do it.

71
00:04:49.453 --> 00:04:52.653
The guy is about as boorish as he can be.

72
00:04:57.553 --> 00:04:59.253
I'm done.

73
00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:02.953
Under the moonlight, Dracula comes to join me in verse.

74
00:05:05.353 --> 00:05:06.953
That's quite amusing.

75
00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:08.253
The use of Dracula,

76
00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:11.053
a very radical character is very stimulating.

77
00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:13.553
Is that kind of poem allowed?

78
00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:17.353
Yes, for the third poem, you can let yourself go.

79
00:05:17.353 --> 00:05:19.853
Let your imagination go wild.

80
00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.753
Let the imagination go wild?

81
00:05:23.953 --> 00:05:26.353
Ms. Mizuki, it's your turn.

82
00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:27.453
Okay.

83
00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:29.953
That text I see there seems to be made in Japan.

84
00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:35.853
I think it'd be better to use the word textbook instead of text.

85
00:05:35.853 --> 00:05:37.953
It's all right if you have an extra word.

86
00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:39.153
Okay.

87
00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.453
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes!

88
00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:44.653
Would you like to give it a try?

89
00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:45.653
Use the last syllable of the last word,

90
00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:47.153
so you'll have to start with a "pan" or "han" word.

91
00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:51.553
All right!

92
00:05:58.953 --> 00:06:01.053
Here goes!

93
00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:05.053
Catching the killer will prove to all that I am a great detective.

94
00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:12.153
Well, what do you think?

95
00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:13.753
Let's see.

96
00:06:13.753 --> 00:06:17.053
"Great detective" and "Dracula" do seem to belong to the same realm

97
00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:19.353
which would bring us back to the "uchikoshi",

98
00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:21.253
but I guess it's all night.

99
00:06:22.953 --> 00:06:25.553
All right, I'm next.

100
00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:31.253
What the future holds for us is what God alone knows for certain.

101
00:06:33.253 --> 00:06:35.253
Bravo, Ms. Reiko.

102
00:06:35.253 --> 00:06:38.753
You've subtly challenged the detective.

103
00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:41.553
Are you saying solving the case won't be so easy?

104
00:06:41.553 --> 00:06:43.653
All right, I'll go next.

105
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.253
"Ru"...

106
00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:49.153
Done!

107
00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:50.353
Human-like monkey,

108
00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:53.953
your face does remind me of the girl next to me.

109
00:06:55.453 --> 00:06:56.753
Funny, isn't it?

110
00:06:56.753 --> 00:06:59.153
The 7th syllable, "O" is the main point.

111
00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:01.453
Huh? What does he mean?

112
00:07:03.453 --> 00:07:05.353
Huh?

113
00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:06.553
Mr. Yagisawa.

114
00:07:06.553 --> 00:07:07.953
Here.

115
00:07:07.953 --> 00:07:09.953
I found it in the lobby just now.

116
00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:12.353
Gosh. I must have dropped it again.

117
00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:13.453
Thank you.

118
00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:14.953
Don't mention it.

119
00:07:18.753 --> 00:07:21.453
I see.

120
00:07:21.453 --> 00:07:23.853
You're all so very good!

121
00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:26.053
How's it going. Mr. Mouri?

122
00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:29.453
Well, not very good actually.

123
00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:31.553
Three more poems to go.

124
00:07:31.553 --> 00:07:34.753
We've got to do something soon.

125
00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:36.553
Hey, Ms. Mizuki.

126
00:07:36.553 --> 00:07:38.053
Didn't you say you wrote the first poem

127
00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:39.653
while you were looking at the autumn leaves

128
00:07:39.653 --> 00:07:42.253
at the rest area in the grounds of the samurai residence?

129
00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.653
Yes.

130
00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:45.253
That's strange.

131
00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:48.253
I went there just a little while ago.

132
00:07:48.253 --> 00:07:51.153
But I couldn't see the leaves from the rest area.

133
00:07:52.253 --> 00:07:53.453
Is that true, Conan?

134
00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:55.153
Yes.

135
00:07:55.153 --> 00:07:58.453
I probably saw the autumn leaves in another location.

136
00:07:58.453 --> 00:07:59.953
Another location?

137
00:07:59.953 --> 00:08:02.153
Where was that?

138
00:08:02.153 --> 00:08:03.853
Well...

139
00:08:04.853 --> 00:08:08.353
Is Ms. Mizuki the killer?

140
00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:11.753
If she isn't, why did she lie like that?

141
00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:21.953
This poem... Could it be...

142
00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:25.053
That means she's doing it for that person.

143
00:08:25.053 --> 00:08:28.453
But what did that dying message mean?

144
00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:40.253
So that's what it meant.

145
00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.853
But why did that person do something like this?

146
00:08:47.153 --> 00:08:48.453
I've got it!

147
00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:50.253
Now, I understand!

148
00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:53.353
Orders from Mr. Mouri for me?

149
00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:55.953
Yes. He said not to tell Detective Yasurai,

150
00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:58.053
and he wants you to investigate something.

151
00:08:58.053 --> 00:08:59.953
All right! I understand!

152
00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:07.553
If my deduction is correct,

153
00:09:07.553 --> 00:09:10.653
that person is the killer.

154
00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:22.361
I've got it!

155
00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:25.161
What do you mean?

156
00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:28.761
I know what Mr. Ushikubo's dying message is.

157
00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:31.661
He wasn't pointing to the bamboo.

158
00:09:31.661 --> 00:09:34.561
He was pointing to something beyond that.

159
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.761
Something beyond the bamboo?

160
00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:40.161
Past the shrubs around the walk way

161
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:43.161
and past Horikawa.

162
00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:44.261
That's right!

163
00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:46.261
It's the site of the samurai homes

164
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:48.461
where Ms. Mizuki went to compose her poem.

165
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:50.761
Which means the killer

166
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.061
is you, Ms. Mizuki!

167
00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:53.861
That's not true.

168
00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:00.861
Hey, Ms. Mizuki!

169
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.761
The 10th poem here, it's a love poem, right?

170
00:10:03.761 --> 00:10:05.361
And it's a one sided love.

171
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:06.361
Huh?

172
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:07.861
And another thing. Mr. Yagisawa.

173
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.661
During dinner, you were whistling, right?

174
00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:12.661
Oh, yes.

175
00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:15.461
So that's what it is!

176
00:10:15.461 --> 00:10:19.761
Mizuki is in love with Yagisawa.

177
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:22.961
I see. So that's why last night, she...

178
00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:25.161
What about last night?

179
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:29.161
Mr. Ushikubo said something cruel to Mr. Yagisawa last night.

180
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.361
Ms. Mizuki was watching them and she looked very worried.

181
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:34.461
Wait just a minute.

182
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:36.661
Are you saying...

183
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:38.761
Oh, I get it!

184
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:42.661
Ms. Mizuki, are you trying to protect Mr. Yagisawa?

185
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:48.161
What do you mean by that, Mr. Mouri?

186
00:10:48.161 --> 00:10:51.461
I mean that she was concerned about what happened

187
00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:54.261
between Mr. Ushikubo and Mr. Yagisawa last night,

188
00:10:54.261 --> 00:10:55.261
so she changed her plans

189
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:58.761
and went to Matsue Castle to see Mr. Ushikubo.

190
00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:02.461
But when she got there, she saw...

191
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.761
No, you're wrong!

192
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:12.261
I saw no such thing!

193
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:14.261
All I saw was...

194
00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:16.061
What did you saw?

195
00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:18.361
Ms. Mizuki.

196
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.761
Ms. Mizuki, I think it'd be better if you told the truth.

197
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:23.361
But, Ms. Reiko...

198
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:25.361
I agree with her.

199
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.761
I'm sorry if I sounded cocky.

200
00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:32.661
But if you really do love him,

201
00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:36.161
and if you really think he's special...

202
00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:42.761
At first, I had planned to go to Gessho Temple,

203
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:45.161
not Matsue Castle.

204
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:48.261
Because I was worried about Mr. Yagisawa.

205
00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:53.661
But the bus heading to Matsue Castle passed by

206
00:11:53.661 --> 00:11:56.561
and I saw Mr. Yagisawa in it.

207
00:11:59.161 --> 00:12:02.961
So I headed for Matsue Castle right away.

208
00:12:02.961 --> 00:12:06.261
But when I got to the walk way,

209
00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:09.661
Mr. Ushikubo was already dead.

210
00:12:09.661 --> 00:12:12.861
And at his fingertip, I found...

211
00:12:15.361 --> 00:12:18.561
After that, I rushed back to the samurai residences

212
00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:21.661
and sat in the rest area until I calmed down.

213
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:25.961
Then when it was time to meet back, I went back to the hotel.

214
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.661
Wait a minute.

215
00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:30.361
Sure, it's true I went to the castle.

216
00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:32.061
But I didn't kill him,

217
00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:33.761
and I didn't go to the walk way either.

218
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:35.961
Then, what part of the castle did you go to?

219
00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:38.561
To the Jouzan Inari Shrine.

220
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:41.661
That's where there's a lot of fox statues, right?

221
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:45.461
That's where Mr. Ushikubo told me to meet him.

222
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.361
About 30 minutes after I got to Gessho Temple,

223
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:52.261
I got an e-mail from Mr. Ushikubo on my phone.

224
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:55.661
It said "Come to the Jouzan Inari Shrine at Matsue Castle right now."

225
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:03.361
It was about 10:05 am when I got to the shrine.

226
00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:08.661
I waited about fifteen minutes, but he never showed up.

227
00:13:08.661 --> 00:13:12.261
So I tried calling his phone, but there was no answer.

228
00:13:12.261 --> 00:13:14.961
There was nothing I could do, so I went back to Gessho Temple

229
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.461
and composed the poem about the big turtle.

230
00:13:17.461 --> 00:13:21.961
Then, why was your eye medicine at the crime scene?

231
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:23.761
I don't know.

232
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.161
I'm telling you the truth detective!

233
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.261
If you don't believe me,

234
00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:29.861
check Mr. Ushikubo's phone.

235
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:33.361
We've already checked all the data on his phone.

236
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:36.661
But there's no record of any message to you like you claimed.

237
00:13:36.661 --> 00:13:38.461
That's impossible!

238
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.661
How about his spare phone?

239
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:44.461
Mr. Ushikubo said he always carried a spare in his bag.

240
00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:46.261
We have checked all his belonging,

241
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:48.661
but there was only one phone.

242
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.361
Mr. Yagisawa.

243
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:54.461
You stole Mr. Ushikubo's spare phone

244
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:58.161
and sent yourself that message, right?

245
00:13:58.161 --> 00:14:00.761
No, that's not true!

246
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:01.961
Detective Yasugi!

247
00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:05.561
-We have found the murder weapon! -What?

248
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:08.361
We found it in the lotus pond at Gessho Temple.

249
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.861
The nightstick was wrapped in this raincoat,

250
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:15.861
and the blood on it matched the victim.

251
00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:18.261
And this raincoat...

252
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:21.161
Yagisawa?

253
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.161
That settles it.

254
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:25.161
That's impossible.

255
00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:27.761
Come on! You can tell us all about it at the station.

256
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:30.861
Officer, it wasn't me.

257
00:14:30.861 --> 00:14:32.161
You're making a big mistake!

258
00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:33.861
Mr. Yagisawa!

259
00:14:52.661 --> 00:14:55.661
Oh, boy. What a poetry composing trip this has turned into.

260
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:00.261
Let's end today's session.

261
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:01.861
Good idea.

262
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.761
Excuse me, I have a poem I would like to contribute.

263
00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:13.761
You're starting with "chi" next, aren't you?

264
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:19.661
I'm finished!

265
00:15:19.661 --> 00:15:22.561
Yummy chocolate candy, hurry and give me some now.

266
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:27.361
No, that's not what you called linked verses!

267
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:29.061
No.

268
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.561
You associated chocolate candy with "ant trail", right?

269
00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:35.061
That's a very amusing poem befitting a child.

270
00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:37.061
The next one should be a flower poem.

271
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.261
Mr. Shiina, you do it.

272
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:42.361
Come on! Make a poem starting with "I" sound.

273
00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:44.061
Make it a pretty one!

274
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:47.061
All right, then!

275
00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:50.261
I'm done.

276
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:54.461
Someday, my daughter and I will go to a temple with flowers.

277
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.061
-What do you think? -How strange.

278
00:15:58.061 --> 00:15:59.461
It's really strange.

279
00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:04.661
That's the poem Pops read to me just a little while ago.

280
00:16:04.661 --> 00:16:06.061
Look.

281
00:16:10.861 --> 00:16:13.561
When did you write that, dad?

282
00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:15.061
Well, I...

283
00:16:17.461 --> 00:16:18.561
Matsue...

284
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.961
Tamatsukuri!

285
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:26.161
-Dad? -Ran.

286
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:29.961
The truth is, I didn't write that poem.

287
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:32.861
Mr. Tomonaga, the man we met in the lobby yesterday

288
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:36.761
from the brokerage firm wrote it.

289
00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:41.461
Mr. Ushikubo had written it down in his memo pad.

290
00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:43.561
Mr. Shiina.

291
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:48.161
You were convinced Mr. Ushikubo came up with it himself, right?

292
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:49.661
He was such a cruel man,

293
00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:53.161
so you couldn't forgive him for writing such a beautiful poem.

294
00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:56.361
That's why you tore it out of his memo pad, didn't you?

295
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:58.861
After you killed him, of course.

296
00:17:01.561 --> 00:17:06.361
Your poems had secret messages in them, right?

297
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.461
The seventh syllable in the seventh poem,

298
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:11.261
the ninth syllable in the ninth poem,

299
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:14.461
and the eleventh syllable in the eleventh poem.

300
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:18.461
"I'm the killer".

301
00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:24.061
That was your challenge to me.

302
00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:26.661
You secretly put messages in your poems

303
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:28.861
mocking both the police and me,

304
00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:31.361
you must have been enjoying yourself.

305
00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:34.461
Judging from your personality

306
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:36.061
and given the right conditions,

307
00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:38.561
I knew you would use the poem you stole from Mr. Ushikubo.

308
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:42.961
So, I had you pegged.

309
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:47.961
Because this is the kind of poem you like.

310
00:17:49.161 --> 00:17:51.961
My favorite poems are those with feelings,

311
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:54.361
like how a father feels for his daughter.

312
00:17:55.361 --> 00:17:58.061
The conditions were perfect.

313
00:17:58.061 --> 00:17:59.761
Then when Mr. Yagisawa was taken away

314
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:02.061
as the suspect in the murder,

315
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:04.261
the thirteenth poem was a flower poem

316
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:08.061
so I composed the previous poem setting things up for you.

317
00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:11.461
So that's why you told Conan to do the twelfth poem.

318
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:12.561
That's right.

319
00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:14.761
And just as I figured,

320
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.561
you used Mr. Ushikubo's poem

321
00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:21.861
because you were so sure that you have won.

322
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:26.161
The secret message in the poems was just a joke.

323
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:27.661
And about that poem,

324
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:30.761
Mr. Ushikubo showed it to me last night.

325
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:33.561
Besides, I have an alibi.

326
00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:34.661
An alibi?

327
00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:38.461
That's right. I just remembered that at about 10:05 am,

328
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:41.461
I saw a female attendant at the art museum

329
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:46.061
found the parents of a lost boy.

330
00:18:46.061 --> 00:18:51.461
You could have set up a video camera below the hedges there

331
00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:54.161
and see it on the tape.

332
00:18:54.161 --> 00:18:57.861
Conan found marks left behind by a tripod.

333
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:02.161
When you arrived at the art museum this morning,

334
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:05.361
you set a video camera up underneath the hedges.

335
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:07.061
Then you sent an e-mail to Mr. Yagisawa

336
00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:09.061
with Mr. Ushikubo's spare phone,

337
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:11.761
which you had stolen beforehand.

338
00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:17.761
Then, you went to Matsue Castle and killed Mr. Ushikubo.

339
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:21.261
After that, you put Mr. Yagisawa's eye medicine

340
00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:24.061
by Mr. Ushikubo's finger.

341
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:25.761
And went to Gessho Temple

342
00:19:25.761 --> 00:19:26.861
to get rid of the raincoat and murder weapon,

343
00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:29.461
then went back to the art museum for the video.

344
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.561
Finally, you came back to the hotel

345
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:34.061
pretending like nothing happened.

346
00:19:34.061 --> 00:19:37.061
That's a very interesting story. Mr. Mouri.

347
00:19:37.061 --> 00:19:38.561
I hate to disappoint you though...

348
00:19:38.561 --> 00:19:41.161
I have the evidence to prove it.

349
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:43.961
It's Mr. Ushikubo's dying message.

350
00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:49.361
He wasn't pointing to the bamboo or the samurai residence.

351
00:19:49.361 --> 00:19:52.061
He was making the number one.

352
00:19:52.061 --> 00:19:54.661
What's that supposed to mean?

353
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:58.961
Ran, what's the first poem in linked verses called?

354
00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:00.361
Hokku.

355
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:03.461
Now, Officer Tsubaki, give us the results from the lab.

356
00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:05.161
Yes, sir.

357
00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:06.761
This is Mr. Shiina's shoe.

358
00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:09.461
The left front hook on the left shoe

359
00:20:09.461 --> 00:20:11.261
is where we found a bloody fingerprint

360
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:13.961
which matched Mr. Ushikubo's right index finger and it was his blood.

361
00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:23.861
He was telling us to check your shoe in his dying message.

362
00:20:23.861 --> 00:20:29.261
You were probably so engrossed with his memo pad

363
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:33.161
that you didn't notice he touched your shoe, right?

364
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:36.461
I give up, Mr. Mouri.

365
00:20:36.461 --> 00:20:39.261
You're right. I killed him.

366
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:42.061
But what made you suspicious of me?

367
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:47.161
The first thing I found strange was last night's drawing of lots.

368
00:20:47.161 --> 00:20:50.361
Usually, the person who makes the lots will draw it last

369
00:20:50.361 --> 00:20:53.261
but you went second.

370
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:55.061
Since we're taking turns according to age,

371
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:56.161
so the next one is me.

372
00:20:57.061 --> 00:20:59.661
You rigged the drawing

373
00:20:59.661 --> 00:21:01.361
so that Mr. Ushikubo would pick a place

374
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.761
that would make killing him easy

375
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:07.061
and your place would be far away giving you an excellent alibi.

376
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:14.361
No wonder you're the country's best private detective.

377
00:21:14.361 --> 00:21:17.561
So, your motive for killing Mr. Ushikubo was...

378
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:21.161
I couldn't forgive him for lying

379
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.761
and cheating us out of our money.

380
00:21:22.761 --> 00:21:26.061
But that doesn't give you the right to pass sentence on him.

381
00:21:26.061 --> 00:21:28.161
Yes, I know that.

382
00:21:29.461 --> 00:21:31.461
I know that very well.

383
00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:35.461
I know only God can pass judgement on him.

384
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:44.961
I guess the God of Izumo brought you here to teach that to me.

385
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:19.561
I'm so happy for them.

386
00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:20.961
It looks like Mr. Yagisawa

387
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:23.361
feels the same for Ms. Mizuki.

388
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.261
It certainly does.

389
00:23:25.261 --> 00:23:27.061
By the way, Ms. Reiko.

390
00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:29.461
There is still one poem left for the linked verses.

391
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:33.461
All right, then. This one will express my gratitude to Mr. Mouri

392
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:37.161
and how I feel about Matsue City.

393
00:23:37.161 --> 00:23:41.361
Infamous Lafcadio Hearn smiles brightly and Spring arrives.

394
00:23:41.361 --> 00:23:43.061
That's a wonderful poem!

395
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:44.961
Isn't that right, dad?

396
00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:47.961
Lafcalio?

397
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:50.061
It's Lafcadio Hearn!

398
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.261
It's about Yakumo Koizumi.

399
00:23:52.261 --> 00:23:53.961
Koizumi...

400
00:23:58.461 --> 00:23:59.561
At this rate,

401
00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:02.461
Lafcadio Hearn, the spring of his amazement,

402
00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:03.761
would be more appropriate.

403
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.461
"Next Episode" -Why you do think...

404
00:24:08.461 --> 00:24:11.261
that thief chose this old shrine?

405
00:24:11.261 --> 00:24:14.361
Even if he did get the offering box open,

406
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:16.361
it doesn't look like there's anything inside, right?

407
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:21.561
What happened?

408
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:24.761
No way.

409
00:24:24.761 --> 00:24:26.561
No, if that's what it was,

410
00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:29.261
it would explain why it had to be that place.

411
00:24:29.861 --> 00:24:31.161
Next Conan,

412
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:35.182
"Strange Punishment"

413
00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:38.179
Next Conan's Hint:

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:40.079
"Offertory box"
