1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,740
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,640
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
The princess and the queen, the two moms.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,340
The key is in Pop's hands.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,940
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:50,368
Pops is asked to find the person

9
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:52,468
who is after the life of Mr. Mikio Fujieda

10
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:55,068
for a fee of 10 million yen.

11
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,868
He thinks this is an easy case

12
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,268
and holds a celebration party in advance, only to spend a lot of money.

13
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,168
He couldn't close the case, however,

14
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,968
and he is in debt of about 8 million yen.

15
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:05,068
He is shocked and takes to his bed.

16
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:08,268
Acting on behalf of pops,

17
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,068
Ran's mom goes to the client's place.

18
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,968
There, she happens to meet my mom.

19
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:21,968
And then, Mr. Mikio Fujieda is killed in a closed room.

20
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:31,968
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 2)"

21
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:40,768
Well, well. It's Eri.

22
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,768
And Yukiko, too.

23
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:47,168
What's the matter with you two?

24
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,268
I'm here for...

25
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,968
I'm here on behalf of my husband.

26
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:56,668
He got a request for finding a person living on the premises

27
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,968
that is after the life of Mr. Mikio Fujieda.

28
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,268
But how did he know

29
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:06,568
that the person is among the people on the premises?

30
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:10,168
These were placed under the pillow of Mr. Mikio Fujieda.

31
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:14,568
"Watch behind you! I'll send you to heaven."

32
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:17,168
So was this used bullet.

33
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,268
Who could have done a thing like that

34
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,868
except someone living in the house?

35
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,668
You could be right.

36
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:26,168
-The crime took place at about... -Hey.

37
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,268
-Wasn't it about 8 pm? -Yes.

38
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,268
It's when all of us were watching

39
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,568
the display of the surveillance camera.

40
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:34,868
I see.

41
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:38,468
Then suddenly, Mr. Fujieda stood up holding his hands up,

42
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,068
was shot and fell down to the floor.

43
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:43,068
We hurried to the room

44
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,668
and heard two gun shots from inside the room.

45
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:48,768
We broke the door, went inside the room,

46
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,168
and found this.

47
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,668
Inspector Megure!

48
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,968
We found the gun, sir.

49
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,368
Good!

50
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:02,568
The gun is a Colt Compact 45 automatic.

51
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,568
There were three cartridges beside the gun

52
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:07,168
and the number of cartridges coincides with the number of bullet wounds.

53
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:11,068
It seems that the culprit shot across this window

54
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,268
and hurried out of this place.

55
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:16,468
Then we have to consider the possibility of a culprit from outside.

56
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,768
But what is this?

57
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:19,868
This towel with a burn on it.

58
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,068
It is probably...

59
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,768
It was probably burnt when the culprit

60
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,468
wrapped the towel around the gun when firing,

61
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:25,968
and tried to hide the powder traces.

62
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:29,668
Or tried to muffle the gun shot but failed.

63
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,968
-Hey, ladies. -Officer Chiba, you go and find out

64
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,668
where and how the gun was obtained.

65
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:34,668
Yes.

66
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:36,768
Officer Takagi, you go and find out

67
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,468
if any suspicious person was around or seen.

68
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:39,568
Yes.

69
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:40,868
Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,568
And by the way...

71
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:45,468
Check the bullets in the body

72
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:48,968
against the bullet left under the pillow, please.

73
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,468
Now, Inspector, bring the lab people

74
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:53,868
and come with me to the living room.

75
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:57,568
We'll check the gun powder traces on all the people in the house,

76
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:58,768
and start questioning them.

77
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,768
Hey, Eri.

78
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,968
Come on, Inspector. Eri is trying her best.

79
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:07,168
-But... -For her, 10 million yen is at stake.

80
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,468
What?

81
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:10,868
Hey!

82
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,968
I wanna go to the toilet.

83
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:14,968
I need to...

84
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:16,568
Toilet!

85
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,968
Then, one by one, let's have each of you talk to the Inspector.

86
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,368
After Mikio was shot in the audio room,

87
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:28,868
for about 3 minutes until we found the dead body,

88
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:31,468
where were you all, and what were you all doing.

89
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:34,968
I went to my room to get the key

90
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,368
and ran to the audio room.

91
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:42,268
I called the police and an ambulance on the phone in my room

92
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:45,268
and I stayed in my room.

93
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:49,568
But you knew your husband was shot?

94
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:53,368
Still, there could be a man with a gun around!

95
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:54,768
Could be.

96
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:57,568
Besides, you know I was watching Mikio get shot and go down

97
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:00,868
on the display with the butler and the others?

98
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:02,868
If you must suspect someone, you can pick on Shigeru

99
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:06,068
because he went out of the monitoring room just before Mikio went down.

100
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:07,968
Did you leave?

101
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:08,968
I did.

102
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,768
I had to write the manuscript I was working on in my room.

103
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:14,568
But I stopped writing

104
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:17,368
and joined Eri and the others to go up to the audio room.

105
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:22,268
I heard the two gun shots in front of the room.

106
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:24,668
So I couldn't have possibly done it.

107
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:29,568
Did you hear any suspicious sound or something?

108
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:34,468
No. The sound of the classical music was so loud.

109
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,068
Excuse me, Inspector,

110
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:38,868
but do you mind if I sit down?

111
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,868
Of course not.

112
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,568
You can sit down, Mr. Ueki and everybody else.

113
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:47,368
I'd prefer to keep standing. It's easier on me.

114
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:48,468
Inspector Megure!

115
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,568
I caught a man loitering around the garden, sir.

116
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,568
-You did? -Hey! Come on up quick.

117
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,668
Oh, he is...

118
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:57,768
He is Mr. Doi, the gardener.

119
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,468
Gardener, is he?

120
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,068
He's been like this, sir.

121
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,368
He doesn't say anything, doesn't answer me.

122
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:09,468
Mr. Doi was at a place in the garden not very far from the audio room,

123
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:13,668
for at least 3 minutes after Mr. Fujieda was shot at 8 o'clock.

124
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,868
Mr. Doi was seen in the surveillance camera and on the display.

125
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,068
He was absorbed in gardening even after the incident

126
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,368
and just didn't come here.

127
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,268
Seeing is believing, they say.

128
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,768
Would you care to go

129
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,968
and take a look at the video of the surveillance camera?

130
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,268
I see.

131
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:32,968
He seems to be in the garden when he was shot.

132
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:37,268
But he disappeared right after it.

133
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:40,368
But the light is seen on the screen.

134
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:44,968
The light is flickering, and that means he is there.

135
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:48,868
But if there were cameras in all of the rooms,

136
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,668
we would be able to tell when, where, and who did what.

137
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:53,068
I wish we knew.

138
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:55,768
But these pictures tell you enough, don't they?

139
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,868
The chance of an outsider is breaking in is slight,

140
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,268
and the possibility that the crime was committed by an insider

141
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:00,768
is more likely.

142
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:01,768
How come?

143
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,368
There are so many cameras around,

144
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,568
but there is no picture of a suspicious person on any of them.

145
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,968
The crime was committed by a person

146
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:13,368
who knows precisely where the cameras are located, see?

147
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,468
I see.

148
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:18,468
So, we have four suspects to go.

149
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:19,468
When they commit the crime,

150
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:23,268
it seems that two of them are always together.

151
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,068
How about going after their motives?

152
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:29,368
Conan, you are very quiet today.

153
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,468
You usually get all excited over a case. What's come over you?

154
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:36,168
The two of them say so much

155
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,368
that there's not much left for me to say.

156
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,468
But this is a strange case.

157
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:44,968
The butler and Motoka were with us watching the display

158
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:46,868
when the first shot was fired.

159
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:49,768
But they have no alibi for the second and third shots.

160
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:53,668
Mr. Doi was not seen after the first shot except for the light.

161
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:56,368
Shigeru Fujieda has no alibi for the first shot,

162
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,068
but he was with us at the second shot.

163
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:03,168
This means, if the displayed image of the surveillance camera is a trick,

164
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,268
or if the second and third shots were part of a trick,

165
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:08,968
their alibis won't stand.

166
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,468
Two things worry me.

167
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,168
One is that the second shot

168
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,668
and the third shot were about 3 minutes apart,

169
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,868
and the other is that he inserted a bookmark into the book he was reading.

170
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:22,068
If he was being threatened with a gun pointed at him,

171
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,668
why did he do such a thing?

172
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:27,768
Who resented him?

173
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,768
Of the four people?

174
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,468
Yes.

175
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:34,068
Mr. Ueki, the butler, for sure.

176
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:36,568
He was ordered to clean the storage that was full of dust,

177
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:38,968
and he had a relapse of asthma.

178
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:44,268
But if I were Shigeru, I would've got angry.

179
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:47,468
I know the Master inherited this residence

180
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:50,968
but Shigeru has been living in this house since his childhood,

181
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:54,268
yet now he has to pay rent because he was told to pay.

182
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:57,868
The young mistress had no grudge on Master, I suppose,

183
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:01,168
but it's so obvious that she married for the inheritance.

184
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,768
I wouldn't be surprised if she is overjoyed about the master's death.

185
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:06,968
You could be right.

186
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:10,568
Mr. Doi, the gardener glared at the young Mistress the other day.

187
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,768
Of course, he would.

188
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,568
When she learned the master was going to rebuild this house,

189
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:15,368
she asked him to break down the garden

190
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,668
and turn it into a swimming pool.

191
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,168
What are you doing up there?

192
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,968
Excuse me, but the late Mistress cared much for the garden.

193
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:28,168
It has been most dear to her.

194
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,168
But...

195
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,268
That's enough. Leave right this minute.

196
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,468
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,868
Excuse me, but are you from Kouchi, Mr. Doi?

198
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:38,868
What?

199
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:41,468
I've been in Takajou town.

200
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:44,368
In Takajou town! What a coincidence.

201
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:46,068
I'm from Kami town.

202
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,068
Wow, from Kami!

203
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:51,768
When I was a small fry, I used to swim in the Kagami River.

204
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,068
You did, ma gal!

205
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:56,468
That river was the prettiest,

206
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,068
and that famous Ryoma Sakamoto

207
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,368
learned swimming in dat river, did ya know?

208
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,768
Is that Kouchi accent?

209
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:04,768
I wonder if Yukiko was born in Kouchi?

210
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,868
No. When she was an actress,

211
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,968
she played a role in Kouchi accent.

212
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,268
She learned the accent then.

213
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:14,768
She is a genius in playing and applying things like this.

214
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,868
That's what Shinichi used to tell me.

215
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:20,268
Is that so?

216
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:21,768
Good news?

217
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:26,668
Yes. He told me a very interesting thing.

218
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,268
He heard the gunshot several seconds

219
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:31,568
after he heard the glass crack.

220
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,468
What?

221
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,668
What does that mean?

222
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,868
Usually, the glass will crack at the same time as the gunshot?

223
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:38,868
I don't know.

224
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,668
The glass was cracked with a gun then the shot was fired?

225
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,768
But it bothers me, the sound of the cracked glass.

226
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:47,268
Naturally, it was before the first gunshot was heard, wasn't it?

227
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:51,568
He doesn't remember how many shots he heard.

228
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:53,268
He thought some naughty kids in the neighborhood

229
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:56,068
were making noise out of bamboo fireworks or something,

230
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,268
so he didn't care much about it.

231
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:02,168
I wonder it may have something to do with the hint Yusaku gave me.

232
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:04,268
Did you call your husband?

233
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,968
Yes, I did just a moment ago.

234
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,768
When I told him about the case,

235
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,368
he chuckled and told me.

236
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:15,768
He says, "Wrong road sign. Tell her that."

237
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,868
Tell her? Tell who?

238
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,368
Huh?

239
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,368
Of course, to you.

240
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,268
Oh, to me.

241
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:26,068
Should I be overjoyed?

242
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,568
Of course not.

243
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:29,768
I thought so.

244
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:40,848
Excuse me, Inspector,

245
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,448
but didn't you investigate enough already?

246
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,848
And besides, now you know it's impossible for us

247
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,348
to have committed the crime.

248
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:49,448
Inspector.

249
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:53,948
The neighbors say they have not seen any suspicious person.

250
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:55,148
I see.

251
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:58,848
And we don't know how the gun was obtained,

252
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,948
but the bullets used in the murder

253
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,448
were identical to the bullet that was used for making threats.

254
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:08,348
But there is one strange thing.

255
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:11,648
One of the bullets extracted out of the body

256
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:13,948
shows a streak on the surface of the bullet.

257
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:15,748
What does that mean?

258
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:17,148
Now I see.

259
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:21,548
-What? -Don't what me!

260
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,948
You look as if you alone know it all already.

261
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:26,148
Who cares because I do know it all.

262
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:29,048
Well, then, tell me all about it, Shinichi, dear.

263
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:31,348
Don't you call yourself the Night Baroness

264
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:34,148
and start a flashy action scene again, mom.

265
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,448
Don't worry. It's all right.

266
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,948
Tonight, I'll be cool and collected with no-frills action.

267
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:40,948
People!

268
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:43,648
It's past eleven o'clock already!

269
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,448
Will you do the rest of it tomorrow?

270
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,748
We are still investigating.

271
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,348
Investigating?

272
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:51,148
You have done all the investigating already and finished it!

273
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:52,648
I don't like to be deceived!

274
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:57,348
Yes, we have been deceived by the culprit.

275
00:13:57,348 --> 00:14:01,048
It was made to look as if Mr. Mikio Fujieda was threatened

276
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,848
with a gun from outside the window and shot.

277
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:08,248
But the culprit couldn't deceive the eyes of the detective.

278
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:17,648
Can't deceive the private eyes of this Baroness of Night!

279
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,148
Hey. Where did she get those lights?

280
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:24,348
Are you saying that...

281
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:26,148
You found out who the culprit is?

282
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:28,148
I surely did.

283
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:31,548
But how did the culprit deceive you?

284
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:34,948
The surveillance camera?

285
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:38,648
We have been deceived a lot earlier than that.

286
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:42,348
The culprit has already deceived us into thinking wrong

287
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,848
by showing us the two memo sheets and the used bullet.

288
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:49,048
The culprit put up a deceiving road sign

289
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:51,448
to make us think he was going to shoot a gun.

290
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:55,548
But Mr. Mikio was actually shot with a gun.

291
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,948
Did you notice, Inspector Megure?

292
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:01,748
Mikio was reading a book just before he was shot,

293
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:05,248
and he placed a bookmark into the book.

294
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:07,448
Yes, I remember.

295
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,348
Usually, you put a bookmark between the pages

296
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:10,548
when you finish reading the page,

297
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:15,448
not when you are threatened with a gun pointed at you.

298
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,948
You are right.

299
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,848
What would you do, Inspector,

300
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,648
if you finished reading a book and wanted to take a rest?

301
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:25,148
I'd turn my head or rub my shoulders.

302
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:27,448
Or stretch out and...

303
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:33,448
That's right. He just stood up and stretched.

304
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,448
Don't be a fool.

305
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,748
Right after that, Mikio fell to the floor, didn't he?

306
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:38,748
You don't go down right after stretching.

307
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:42,048
It's not the stretching that did it. Standing up did it.

308
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,448
It's rare, but some people stand up quickly

309
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:46,748
and feel faint or fall down.

310
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:50,348
But how could he have fainted at such convenient timing?

311
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:52,748
There is a drug that does it.

312
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:58,348
The name of the chemical is isop... isopro... isope?

313
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,348
Isoprotelenol, it is.

314
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:03,148
It is used for inducing faintness.

315
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:06,048
It is given to patients who have a tendency to faint easily,

316
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,848
and it's used for inducing feeling faint.

317
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,148
They are trying to find out what causes fainting.

318
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:13,048
I see. That drug made him faint

319
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:16,048
and made us believe that he held at gun point then shot.

320
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,648
Is that right?

321
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,348
Yes. What I wanted to say is that

322
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:21,748
he was not yet shot at that time.

323
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:25,348
But the culprit thought that it was not sufficient to fool us,

324
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:30,748
so added a word to make sure to mislead us.

325
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:33,148
He said, "The master is holding his hands up."

326
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:35,848
What? Don't tell me...

327
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:38,348
He had us taken in good.

328
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:39,448
Yeah.

329
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:40,948
You did really well, didn't you?

330
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,348
Mr. Souhachi Ueki, the butler.

331
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:45,048
Mr. Ueki knew well

332
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:47,648
that Mr. Fujieda drinks coffee while he reads a book.

333
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:51,648
And he stands up and stretches after reading.

334
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,748
This chemical is good for asthma

335
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,848
when you take a moderate amount of it.

336
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,248
Well, he made an alibi for himself

337
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,948
and then pretended to go and get the key to the audio room,

338
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:04,148
but he actually went to the room from outside,

339
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:09,048
and shot three bullets into Mr. Fujieda who was passed out,

340
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,948
to murder him.

341
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,948
But you heard two shots, didn't you?

342
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:18,248
Yukiko asked Mr. Doi and learned so a while ago.

343
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:20,748
Several seconds after the sound of the glass cracking,

344
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,748
he heard the shots.

345
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:27,948
And there was the loud sound of classical music played.

346
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,348
You understand, don't you?

347
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,848
I see.

348
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:33,748
It's a silencer!

349
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:36,548
He put a silencer on when he fired the first shot

350
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,748
so only the sound of glass cracking was heard.

351
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:44,648
And the silencer left a streak on the surface of the bullet.

352
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:49,148
Then he used a towel to hide the traces of gun powder.

353
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,548
Anyway, go find the silencer.

354
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,348
You don't need to.

355
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:57,048
Because the butler must still have it.

356
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,648
Probably in one of his socks.

357
00:17:58,648 --> 00:17:59,648
What?

358
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,748
Excuse me.

359
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:05,048
Inspector! I've found it, the silencer!

360
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:10,148
He hesitated to sit down, so it dawned on me.

361
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,148
Sitting down will make the hem of his pants go up

362
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:15,848
and it may show what he had concealed.

363
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:19,048
Hey. You have burn marks!

364
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,348
I can withstand the burn, sir.

365
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:24,848
It's nothing, if I can keep the garden for the late Mistress.

366
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:27,448
-The garden, you say? -Yes, sir.

367
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,348
The garden of the premises has been carefully maintained

368
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:34,048
since the madam was a little child.

369
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:38,048
I feel she is somewhere here with me.

370
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:43,548
I cannot forgive the master, who is a perfect stranger to the house,

371
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,248
to have everything done his own way.

372
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:47,748
Gosh!

373
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:50,248
So, it's you. You're the culprit.

374
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:54,048
All this time, I thought it was his brother, Shigeru.

375
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,648
Now, my share of inheritance has decreased.

376
00:18:57,548 --> 00:19:01,348
I hired a detective to get something on him,

377
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,748
but I made a big mistake!

378
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:03,848
Listen.

379
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:08,148
If Mr. Mikio Fujieda had no parents, brothers or sisters,

380
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,848
you would've gotten the entire share of inheritance.

381
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,648
No share goes to the brothers of a former wife.

382
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:13,848
Really?

383
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:16,148
Why, I got it all wrong!

384
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:19,748
But this is only if Mr. Fujieda left no will behind.

385
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:23,148
Anyway, I must ask for the amount of 10 million yen

386
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:25,248
for finding the culprit.

387
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,648
What? How can you?

388
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,048
Mikio got killed already!

389
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,348
The contract says

390
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:33,648
nothing about protecting Mr. Fujieda's life, as you can see.

391
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:36,248
See? Your signature and seal are here.

392
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:39,348
Okay.

393
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:42,748
With Mikio's inheritance, 10 million yen is small money.

394
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,548
I might add that until the inheritance is settled and finalized,

395
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,448
all the assets in the name of Mr. Fujieda's will be frozen,

396
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,848
so please pay me out of your private account.

397
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:53,948
I don't believe it!

398
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,548
You'd better. If you refuse to pay,

399
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:59,248
I will execute it by law to attach your property.

400
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,948
You understand, I hope?

401
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,748
Well, so it goes.

402
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:08,348
Afterwards, Mikio Fujieda's will was publicized as follows.

403
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:10,648
It said, "No inheritance will go to

404
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:12,348
those who were not able to protect my life.

405
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:14,248
The entire estate shall be donated to the country."

406
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,948
This has been carried out to the letter.

407
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,548
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The next day.

408
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,848
Here you are, dear.

409
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,448
After deducting your debt,

410
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,548
it comes down to one million and 943 thousand yen.

411
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,448
Now, you can thank me.

412
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:55,848
Don't you smell something?

413
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,848
Do you keep a pet or something?

414
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:02,848
A client of mine came this morning with a dog, and it did it.

415
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:09,848
By the way, it's been a long time, Yukiko.

416
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:13,348
Yeah. There's something that I want to ask you, Kogoro.

417
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,148
Hey, Eri. Come on and ask him.

418
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:18,648
No. You're the one who wanted to ask.

419
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:20,548
They want to know which one you chose

420
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,248
for the Miss Teitan High School Contest.

421
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:28,648
You mean the one that took place 20 years ago.

422
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,348
It's probably Eri

423
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,448
because they were in love with each other.

424
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,048
Surely it's Yukiko.

425
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:37,248
She was unbelievably beautiful, then.

426
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:40,048
It must be Eri, if I remember right.

427
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,548
Dear.

428
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:46,648
I was very ignorant of those festivities at that time

429
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:49,448
so I took the word "Miss" Teitan to mean mistake

430
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,848
and wrote the name of the one who I thought was a klutz.

431
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:53,948
What?

432
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:55,648
Then, if you knew what it really meant,

433
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:57,648
which one would you have chosen?

434
00:22:57,648 --> 00:22:59,048
Of course, it's Yukiko.

435
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:02,748
You don't have to ask me. She was utterly beautiful.

436
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:09,748
No! Eri was pretty, too, for a smart girl!

437
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:13,448
I'd like to tell you.

438
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:15,548
For the work Yukiko and I did for you this time,

439
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:19,048
we'll take 10 percent of the total, which is 1 million yen.

440
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,648
And for us, I have to get paid for the bills at the bars,

441
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,748
and be reimbursed for dad's advance allowance,

442
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:28,548
and the living expenses for this month and next month.

443
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:30,748
And laundering dad's pants.

444
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:32,348
Here is your change.

445
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:34,348
Hey.

446
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:37,948
It's only 4,382 yen in all.

447
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:41,248
Well, let's go out and have something delicious, Yuki.

448
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:42,748
Let's go, Eri.

449
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:45,248
Hey!

450
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,548
And which one won the contest?

451
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:51,048
It's marginal.

452
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,748
"Next Episode"

453
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:03,848
They were tailing us for quite some time.

454
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,248
Right, I thought so, too.

455
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:09,948
So, I was planning to take off as soon as the light turned red.

456
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,448
I wonder who they are?

457
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:22,648
Next Conan, "Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 1)"

458
00:24:23,016 --> 00:24:25,616
Together with Hanga.

459
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:26,616
Yeah, yeah.

460
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,216
A messy room!

461
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,716
This is bad, Conan! Summer vacation is almost over!

462
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,616
Second semester has already started.
