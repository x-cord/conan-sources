1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.810
A racing second hand, a shining comet!

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.160
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.900
Today's stage is a significant
hospital room! Find the case's virus!

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.580
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.780
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.909
"The Robber Hospitalization Case."

7
00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.139
I'm home-- Huh?

8
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:02.969
Weren't you going to
Okino Yoko's concert today, Dad?

9
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.809
Oh, Dad.
Socks! Socks!

10
00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.719
Be careful!
Necktie! Necktie!

11
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.179
Jacket! Jacket! Ticket! Ticket!

12
00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.719
And...

13
00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:25.849
...watch your step.

14
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.069
Please! Drop me off at
Okino Yoko-chan's concert hall!

15
00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.759
Today's her last day playing there.

16
00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:50.539
You broke your leg and you're
in an ambulance, not a taxi!

17
00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.839
Yoko-chan! Oww!

18
00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:56.959
Beika General Hospital

19
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.189
What a huge hospital!

20
00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.949
That's for certain...

21
00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.259
What room is he in?

22
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.789
I dunno. I'll go ask at the desk.

23
00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.429
He's in Room 503!

24
00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.389
Alright! Let's go!

25
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.469
Akabane Goemon Sekiguchi Daisaburo
Mori Kogoro

26
00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.389
How lame! Falling down some
steps and breaking a bone!

27
00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.509
Not to mention the cause
was an Okino Yoko concert!

28
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.229
You know you shouldn't
rush down stairs.

29
00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.179
Shaddup. I don't feel
like hearing that from you,

30
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.389
especially since you only
dropped by on your way to play.

31
00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.639
You found us out?

32
00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.059
Conan-kun's going to teach
us to play soccer in the park!

33
00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.949
Then get lost already.

34
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:08.719
Now, now, Mori-san. Does it
really matter if they only dropped by?

35
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.919
I had lots of visitors when I first
came here, but now I get none.

36
00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.339
You should be happy
that someone came to see you.

37
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.339
Right, neighbor?

38
00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.309
He sure isn't friendly...

39
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.639
He was carried in here a week ago.

40
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.349
Apparently, he was seriously
hurt in a car accident.

41
00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:36.059
Oh, Yoshio!
How rare it is to see you!

42
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.559
How's your back, Dad?

43
00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.719
Oh, it's much better now.

44
00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.889
Two weeks in the hospital because
of a bad back... how pathetic.

45
00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.529
Are you making sure to take your pills?

46
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.239
I forgot to take today's.

47
00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.249
You know that's no good.
You're diabetic, you know.

48
00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:00.919
Say, where's Yumi-chan?

49
00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.599
Did she not come with you?

50
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:17.059
O-Oh, Yumiko, she, uhh,
you know, went ice-skating with a friend.

51
00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.889
Oh, that's a shame. It would've
been nice to see my granddaughter.

52
00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.029
It can't be helped.
Yumiko just loves to play.

53
00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.149
What's yer problem?!

54
00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:33.179
N-Nothing!

55
00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:34.679
Quit starin' at me!

56
00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:36.279
S-Sorry!

57
00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:41.929
Say, have they caught the guys yet?

58
00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:46.679
You know, the guys who
robbed your bank last week.

59
00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:50.139
N-No, I hear they're still on the run.

60
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.759
In that case, why not speak
with Mori Kogoro-san there?

61
00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.889
Maybe he'll figure something out!

62
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.559
Hello.

63
00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:00.769
M-Mori? The famous detective?

64
00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:03.229
Yes!

65
00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:09.459
Oh, but all I did was
tremble in fear under a desk...

66
00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:10.699
How pathetic.

67
00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.539
Say! Are those the
guys from the criminal group

68
00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.959
that stole 100 million yen
and still hasn't been caught?!

69
00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:20.909
That's right. They stole
100 million in broad daylight,

70
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.379
without hurting anyone!

71
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:24.409
Beika Bank

72
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:25.709
They disabled the security in
advance and acted with precision,
Beika Bank

73
00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:29.539
They disabled the security in
advance and acted with precision,

74
00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.969
so their crime syndicate must
be quite a large organization.

75
00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:40.409
100 million yen?
Could that buy a boxed eel lunch?

76
00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.989
That could buy you anything!

77
00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:44.459
Using stolen money is bad!

78
00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:46.079
Y-Yeah, you're right!

79
00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.649
How many robbers were in the bank?

80
00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.069
L-Like I said, I was under
my desk, shaking, so...

81
00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:57.499
But the leader must've said to put
your hands up or something, right?

82
00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:04.569
Shut up! If you don't wanna die,
hit the floor and stay there!

83
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:08.759
Oh, well...

84
00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.409
Oh, Dad. I have things to do,
so I should be going.

85
00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:14.659
You're leaving?

86
00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.789
I'll see you later.

87
00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:19.869
Bring a present or something
next time you come!

88
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:20.589
Yeah.

89
00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:37.869
Excuse me.

90
00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:41.329
We're with the police.
You're Sekiguchi Yoshio-san, correct?

91
00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:43.289
Y-Yes. Why do you ask?

92
00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:45.749
We'd like to ask you a few things.

93
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:51.039
That man in the bed next to
your father was in a car accident.

94
00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.549
Has anyone come to visit him?

95
00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.749
I-I don't know. I only met him today.

96
00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:00.139
W-Well, I have things to do, so...

97
00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:10.899
My guess is that the robbers
probably escaped overseas in a boat.

98
00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.399
They're hiding out in
some mountains somewhere.

99
00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:18.119
Nah, they're probably on a shopping
spree with their stolen money!

100
00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:21.869
I doubt they'd immediately
use the money they stole.

101
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:24.079
Where could they be hiding?

102
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:30.959
There's still a good chance
the criminal group is nearby.

103
00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:34.289
A bank [ginko] robber
can only be nearby [kinko].

104
00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.049
Get it?!

105
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.709
Let's go.

106
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.809
Let's let him rest in peace.

107
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:44.269
What do you think,
Sekiguchi-san?

108
00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:45.149
Oh...

109
00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:50.069
And he was so full of energy earlier...

110
00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:51.949
Did he get tired out, I wonder?

111
00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:58.289
It wouldn't be nice to wake him up,
so our theory party is over.

112
00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:00.459
Aww, you're no fun.

113
00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.249
Conan. Okino Yoko-chan's
on a music show at 3:00,

114
00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:05.249
and I wanna watch it in the lobby.

115
00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:07.539
Could you get me a
wheelchair from downstairs?

116
00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:08.169
Sure.

117
00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:14.119
Living the hospital
life isn't all that bad!

118
00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:39.949
I can't... I just can't do it...

119
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:41.909
What's the problem?

120
00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:46.209
Don't tell me you're gonna
wimp out at this point?

121
00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:52.209
A-Are you aware that
Mori Kogoro is in that room?!

122
00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:55.499
Not to mention there are
police lurking outside the room...

123
00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:59.039
Forget about the cops.
I have that taken care of.

124
00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.679
And don't worry about the detective.

125
00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:06.329
He'll be gone from the room
before your 3:30 deadline.

126
00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:12.689
He's gonna watch some idol
TV show in the lobby at 3:00.

127
00:10:12.689 --> 00:10:16.609
Those brats are off
getting him a wheelchair.

128
00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:20.409
B-But I can't do it right
in front of my father!

129
00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:23.079
You gave him the sleeping pills, right?

130
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.439
Then there's nothin' to worry about.

131
00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:28.959
M-My daughter! Is Yumiko all right?!

132
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:33.279
Damn, you're annoying.

133
00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:43.619
Yeah? What's going on?

134
00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:44.349
His daughter?

135
00:10:44.909 --> 00:10:49.309
She's having a blast.
Should I put her on?

136
00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:51.769
Here.

137
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:52.659
Daddy?

138
00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:54.519
Y-Yumiko!

139
00:10:54.999 --> 00:10:58.539
I'm having lots of
fun with a nice lady here!

140
00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:01.489
Come get me when you're
done talking with the doctor, okay?

141
00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:02.949
Yumiko!

142
00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:07.969
Yumiko!

143
00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:09.709
Creampuffs

144
00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:12.209
Here. Here's his present.
Creampuffs

145
00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.119
You know what to do, right?

146
00:11:20.119 --> 00:11:24.659
Your chance to do it is before the
doctors make their rounds at 3:30,

147
00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.059
when surveillance isn't
so tight. Should be simple.

148
00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:34.039
B-But I've never killed anyone,
or even shot a gun before!

149
00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:38.659
Whoops! You'll only rouse
suspicion if you shout.

150
00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:45.039
Listen. Put the gun up to him
and pull the trigger. You can't miss.

151
00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:48.929
Grow some balls and shoot the guy.

152
00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:50.769
Then it'll all be over.

153
00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:53.079
B-But...

154
00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:59.509
You still got time. Freshen up
in the john and calm down first.

155
00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:01.169
Do it for your daughter.

156
00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.149
What took so long, Conan-kun?

157
00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:16.829
Geez! What were you doin'?!

158
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:20.099
Sorry! My stomach suddenly hurt, so...

159
00:12:20.099 --> 00:12:22.769
Did you remember to wash your hands?

160
00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:24.799
I don't feel like hearing that from you...

161
00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:29.179
So you're certain of it?

162
00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:33.019
Yes. The tire tracks from
the car used in the robbery

163
00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:36.599
match with the car Akabane was in.

164
00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:43.609
The robbers likely thought
Akabane was dead and left him behind.

165
00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:17.429
Just by coincidence,
Akabane is in Detective Mori's room.

166
00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:20.929
Oh? I hear he broke a bone...

167
00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:22.979
Yes. His right leg.

168
00:13:22.979 --> 00:13:24.989
Again?!

169
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:29.309
He broke that leg
not too long ago, too!

170
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.699
Talk about an unlucky guy.

171
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:34.469
Anyways, I'm heading
back to the station.

172
00:13:34.469 --> 00:13:38.769
When you deem he's fit enough
for questioning, haul him on over.

173
00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:41.079
Understood, Inspector!

174
00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:42.769
"I-Inspector"?!

175
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:47.839
T-This is my chance! He's not
here to keep watch over me!

176
00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:54.139
If I tell the inspector everything
here, he might be able to...

177
00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:56.219
U-Umm!

178
00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:59.809
Is something the matter?

179
00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:03.059
Y-Yes! A-Actually...

180
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:05.149
Quit screwing around.

181
00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:12.449
You heard my partner.
You're always under our watch.

182
00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:16.699
Any more funny business and
you'll be dealt with immediately.

183
00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:18.769
What is it?

184
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:23.719
Oh, it's nothing. He asked if I had
any medicine, since he feels ill.

185
00:14:23.719 --> 00:14:26.709
You should ask
doctors that, not policemen!

186
00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:29.219
Seriously!

187
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:06.039
How long does it take
to borrow a stupid wheelchair?!

188
00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:09.769
Conan suddenly ran off,
so we went looking for him!

189
00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:13.679
Damn you, Conan!
You're gonna get a Cobra Twist later!

190
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:20.349
Damn you, Conan!

191
00:15:20.349 --> 00:15:22.599
Push! Push! Push! Push!

192
00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:26.139
Oww!

193
00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:27.809
That's my line!

194
00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:31.599
What were you doing?!
Yoko-chan's show is about to start!

195
00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:33.769
You always run off!

196
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:36.519
Conan! Help push! I gotta get to the TV!

197
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.559
Sorry, sorry!

198
00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:41.099
It's all you guys' fault
if I miss Yoko-chan's singing!

199
00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:42.789
It hasn't even started yet!

200
00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:45.519
See!

201
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:47.749
I made it in time!

202
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:50.969
Hey. I need you guys to do something.

203
00:15:50.969 --> 00:15:51.859
Oh?

204
00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:54.719
What is it?

205
00:15:55.099 --> 00:15:56.929
Sure! Leave it to us!

206
00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:58.849
Just tell her that?

207
00:15:58.849 --> 00:15:59.679
Let's go!

208
00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:04.849
Hey! Hey! You're not gonna watch?!

209
00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:09.789
I can't do it. I'm up against a wall.
No one'll believe me now.

210
00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:13.239
3:24.

211
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:19.659
3:30 is the deadline. If I don't
do it before then, Yumiko'll be...

212
00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:24.409
Yumiko'll be thrown off that roof...

213
00:16:24.409 --> 00:16:26.479
Yeah. I have to do it.

214
00:16:28.099 --> 00:16:30.269
I have to, or she'll die!

215
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:33.469
He did say they'd take care
of things so I wouldn't be found out,

216
00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:36.379
and I'd only be killing a bank robber...

217
00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:38.679
Nobody would give a care if I--

218
00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:40.759
Don't do it.

219
00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:45.229
You've been asked to
kill that Akabane guy, right?

220
00:16:45.849 --> 00:16:48.939
Using the weapon
inside that creampuff box.

221
00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:51.099
How do you know that?!

222
00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:53.899
Shh! Don't look at me! They'll notice!

223
00:16:58.719 --> 00:17:00.149
How did you--

224
00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:01.739
That creampuff box.

225
00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:06.769
Your father can't have sweets-- he's diabetic.

226
00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:08.769
It was obvious something was up,

227
00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:11.749
given you're still in the hospital
with a box that can't be a present,

228
00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:16.719
especially after you said you
had to leave to take care of things.

229
00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:21.509
Plus, it's forbidden to use
cell phones inside hospitals.

230
00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:27.979
Yet strange men carrying them
are lurking around, watching you.

231
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:33.679
Your daughter's being held hostage
atop that department store, right?

232
00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:37.989
You mumbled her name
while glancing out the window,

233
00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:42.909
and someone there is looking
this way through binoculars.

234
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:45.349
I-I've been caught in a trap.

235
00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:48.599
I got a call to come
here with my daughter

236
00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:50.919
to discuss my father's condition...

237
00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:55.019
If you value your daughter's life,
you'll kill Akabane!

238
00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:57.099
If you wanna hate anyone,
hate the man who just happened

239
00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:00.429
to get stuck in the same
room as your old man!

240
00:18:00.769 --> 00:18:03.809
They plan to kill you, too.

241
00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:07.929
Immediately after you kill Akabane.

242
00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:11.929
They're those bank robbers, most likely.

243
00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:16.359
Their plan is to silence their partner
and place all the blame on you

244
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:21.599
by making it look like you worked
at the bank as a spy for them.

245
00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:23.319
Y-You can't be serious...

246
00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:29.749
That's the story, based on what
the inspector also said in the bathroom.

247
00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:35.269
The doctors will be making their rounds.
Please return to your rooms.

248
00:18:35.269 --> 00:18:38.509
O-Oh no! Three minutes left!
I have to go!

249
00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:42.389
Dammit! Doesn't look like Genta
and the others'll make it in time!

250
00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:45.349
And I don't know how
many of them are in here...

251
00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:47.139
Got no choice!

252
00:18:47.139 --> 00:18:51.059
Wow! Creampuffs!
Let me have one, mister!

253
00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:52.429
S-Stop!

254
00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:55.229
Huh? There's a gun inside!

255
00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.729
So cool!

256
00:18:56.729 --> 00:18:57.899
Watch out!

257
00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:00.739
That officer, too?!

258
00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:04.429
You know better than that, kid!

259
00:19:04.429 --> 00:19:06.409
Let me go!

260
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:17.589
H-Hey!

261
00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:24.139
What's going on?!

262
00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:27.849
It looks like they slipped on my ball!

263
00:19:28.599 --> 00:19:30.309
Crap! There's another one!

264
00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:36.729
Yeah? Did it go as planned?

265
00:19:36.729 --> 00:19:40.679
No! It failed!
Take the kid hostage and get--

266
00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:49.579
Hey! Hello?!

267
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:52.289
You dumbass! I'm down here!

268
00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:54.169
Look at the entrance to the hospital!

269
00:20:04.429 --> 00:20:06.589
Hey, lady...

270
00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:09.019
Yumiko-chan!

271
00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:11.889
Is there a Yumiko-chan here?

272
00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:14.929
Yeah, I'm Yumiko.

273
00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:18.359
So was this lady
the person you were with?

274
00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:22.769
She's out cold, but should
we tell her what Conan said too?

275
00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:23.809
Yeah.

276
00:20:23.809 --> 00:20:28.599
"The plan has failed! I'll contact
you later! Leave the kid and scram!"

277
00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:30.289
What do you think that means?

278
00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:35.299
Him, too?

279
00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:36.539
Daddy!

280
00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:40.169
Daddy! Daddy!

281
00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:42.639
Yumiko...

282
00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:45.599
Yumiko!

283
00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:49.639
Yumiko! Yumiko!

284
00:20:50.719 --> 00:20:52.349
That hurts, Daddy!

285
00:20:58.099 --> 00:20:59.389
Good for you!

286
00:20:59.389 --> 00:21:02.429
I contacted Inspector Megure
and told him to come here,

287
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.899
so you'll be all right if
you explain everything to him.

288
00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:09.119
C'mon! Let's go, Conan!

289
00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:11.699
Aren't you going to
teach us to play soccer?!

290
00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:13.239
Yeah!

291
00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:14.659
Wait, hold on!

292
00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:18.919
Just who are you?

293
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:22.879
Edogawa Conan. A detective.

294
00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:26.929
Let's go!

295
00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:29.429
What happened
to the ball, Conan-kun?

296
00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:04.989
Could you tell me what room
Mori Kogoro is in? He has a broken leg.

297
00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:05.699
Of course!

298
00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:08.939
Let's go! Let's go! Yoko-san!
Yoko-chan!

299
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:12.239
Yoko-chan! You're the best!

300
00:23:12.619 --> 00:23:14.119
Mori-san is in Room--

301
00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:17.489
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!
No, that's alright.

302
00:23:17.489 --> 00:23:21.709
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!

303
00:23:21.709 --> 00:23:25.669
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!

304
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:27.529
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!

305
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:29.629
Dad!

306
00:23:32.529 --> 00:23:36.989
I sprained my foot! Call a doctor!

307
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:38.659
Whatever!

308
00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:41.099
Doctor!

309
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:47.039
The Fox is out to kill you?!

310
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:52.659
Look out!

311
00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:54.499
Those are bullets! Stay down!

312
00:23:56.669 --> 00:24:00.119
Allow the great Mori Kogoro
to catch the deadly Fox

313
00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:03.669
that's given the police so much trouble!

314
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:07.299
Something's not right!
There's something more to this guy!

315
00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:13.209
On the next Conan... "The Traverse
of Terror Murder Case (Part 1)."
