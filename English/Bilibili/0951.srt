1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,770
Heave ho! Heave ho!

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,170
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,570
The steam locomotive's moving.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,570
It's always so cool.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,970
"Yujiro Tamaki (65)" -Oh, no. It's already 11 am.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,270
Hurry, kids.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,070
Okay!

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,970
Heave ho! Heave ho!

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,570
Amidst the whistling,

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,370
a case occurs at everyone's favorite used bookstore.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,970
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:21,319
-Right? -Yeah.

17
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,030
For example,

18
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,908
only 500 copies of this book were published in 1920.

19
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:30,120
There are currently many copies on the market,

20
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,705
but this one is in good condition.

21
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:33,331
I don't care what they are.

22
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,834
Will you buy all of them?

23
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:39,629
Excuse me, but are these books yours?

24
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,424
No, they belong to my husband.

25
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:45,719
Does your husband know you're selling them?

26
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,639
Seems you don't have his permission.

27
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,934
It's fine. He's in the hospital.

28
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,437
They're just taking up space.

29
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:58,231
What? Are you saying you won't buy them?

30
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,027
No. Personally, I'd very much like to purchase them.

31
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:06,114
But please get your husband's permission to sell them.

32
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,208
Pretty, aren't they?

33
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,209
Yeah.

34
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,712
I took them using my phone's camera.

35
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:22,422
They're very good.

36
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,133
What happened?

37
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,804
There was a little bug inside a book.

38
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,222
That's a silverfish.

39
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:33,141
A silverfish? What's that?

40
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:35,519
Silverfish, written using the characters for paper and fish.

41
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,814
They're bugs that like to eat the glue in the binding of books.

42
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,733
They're fish even though they're bugs?

43
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:44,319
Look closely at its body.

44
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,613
With its silver scale-like skin

45
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,616
and the way it wiggles its body to move, it looks like...

46
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:52,619
Now that you mention it, it does look like a fish.

47
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:55,413
How filthy. What should I do?

48
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:59,709
It's all right. They're easily dealt with.

49
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:04,005
You need this and some kind of paper.

50
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:07,008
Mr. Yujiro, use this.

51
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,635
Thank you.

52
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,220
Then you do this.

53
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,139
It smells good.

54
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:13,807
Smells like lavender.

55
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:18,812
Silverfish dislike the smell of herbs, especially lavender.

56
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:24,526
Simply place a lavender-scented piece of paper in the bookshelf,

57
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:27,320
and the silverfish will go away.

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,738
Amazing!

59
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:31,032
How informative.

60
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:33,243
I should try that at home.

61
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:39,124
Well, we should get going.

62
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:41,918
Thank you for coming.

63
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,927
"Ryosuke Sawada (35)" -Welcome. Sit wherever you'd like.

64
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,309
How much are these books worth?

65
00:04:57,309 --> 00:05:01,021
An appraisal? Let me see.

66
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:04,733
These are all rare books.

67
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,443
Excuse me.

68
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,820
Would they be worth 500,000 yen?

69
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,238
Don't be absurd.

70
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,615
It depends on their condition,

71
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,910
but all together they'd be worth over 200,000 yen.

72
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,620
That jerk...

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,415
I can't accurately appraise them without seeing them in person.

74
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,835
If possible, please bring them here.

75
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:27,631
I'll be waiting.

76
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,516
What a truly relaxing space.

77
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,518
"Ichiro Tamaki (35)" -Thank you for coming.

78
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:42,604
"Michiko Yoshikawa (27)" -Would you like another coffee?

79
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:44,940
I suppose I would.

80
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,317
Is Mr. Yujiro not here today?

81
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:49,319
He's in the back.

82
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,404
He's currently checking

83
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,823
and mending all the books he bought yesterday.

84
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:03,625
Hey, you came.

85
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,835
Are these books...

86
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,421
Yeah, they're Mizutani's books.

87
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,632
You bought the rare books, too?

88
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,342
No. Apparently

89
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:14,928
the husband asked that she not sell the rare books,

90
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:17,639
so I bought everything else.

91
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,307
Really?

92
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:23,103
Dad, someone named Mizutani is calling for you.

93
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,731
It's me.

94
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,109
What? Really?

95
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:32,529
No, nonsense.

96
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,740
I understand. I'll head there immediately.

97
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,534
Is something wrong?

98
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:39,619
The rare books were stolen.

99
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:41,204
What?

100
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:44,833
But why did she call you?

101
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:49,004
It seems she believes I stole them.

102
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:50,922
"Mizutani"

103
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:53,008
Hand over the books you stole!

104
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,010
Calm down.

105
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,720
Start by telling me what happened

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,805
when the books were stolen.

107
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:03,435
I went out for lunch with a friend today.

108
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:06,021
We finished eating around 1 pm.

109
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,107
I came home immediately and discovered

110
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:13,320
the window was broken and the books were missing.

111
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,739
You called the police, right?

112
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:16,823
Yes.

113
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:18,616
The police said it must've been a professional

114
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,618
based on how the window was broken.

115
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:23,121
I was at the store all day today.

116
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,041
I couldn't have stolen from you.

117
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,835
That confirms Mr. Yujiro's alibi.

118
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:30,337
We can't be sure yet.

119
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:32,922
He could've gotten someone to steal them.

120
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:35,342
I wouldn't do that.

121
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:38,136
Those books were at our house for nearly twenty years.

122
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:41,639
But the moment you appraised them, they were stolen.

123
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,808
How do you explain that?

124
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,143
Well...

125
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:50,315
She really suspected him.

126
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,734
I know.

127
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:56,529
Hey, let's catch the real culprit.

128
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,908
Now, now. Let the police handle the investigation.

129
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:02,243
-What? -What is it?

130
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,204
I can't find my phone.

131
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,705
It must be at the cafe.

132
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,415
Should we go back to get it?

133
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:10,835
Someone's probably still at the store.

134
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,837
Sorry. Could we do that?

135
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:20,804
I'm sorry, but the store is closed for...

136
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:24,015
You came to get some books appraised the other day.

137
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:26,935
I want to know their exact value.

138
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:30,814
Very well. Allow me to take a look.

139
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,403
These are truly good books.

140
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,737
They're in good condition.

141
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,740
You can get a good price for these.

142
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,702
Anyway, what a coincidence.

143
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:50,125
I just recently appraised the same book.

144
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,544
I wasn't expecting to appraise them two days in a row.

145
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:54,712
Oh, no.

146
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,345
Sir, where did you get these books?

147
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:05,432
What does it matter? Hurry up and appraise them.

148
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:08,935
You stole these from Mizutani's house, didn't you?

149
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,228
No!

150
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm sorry, but I'll be calling the police.

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,025
What? These are my books!

152
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,236
You can tell that to the police.

153
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,113
Wait.

154
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:21,448
Stop.

155
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:36,045
Did something happen?

156
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:37,630
Let's check it out.

157
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,218
Is it a case?

158
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:44,137
Mr. Yujiro.

159
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,515
Mr. Yujiro, are you hurt?

160
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,434
You kids again?

161
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:52,437
We came to the cafe next door to get something.

162
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:55,231
Then we saw the crowd.

163
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,942
This isn't my blood.

164
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,235
Then...

165
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:04,616
He's a suspect in this case.

166
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,409
What?

167
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:19,374
What's going on?

168
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:21,585
I called the police.

169
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,462
She discovered the body.

170
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:29,593
I clearly saw him standing next to the body.

171
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:33,680
Inspector Megure, we've identified the man.

172
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,766
The victim was Ryosuke Sawada, 35 years old.

173
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,978
He lives nearby and is unemployed.

174
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,688
What's the cause of death?

175
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:44,482
A cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the head.

176
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:47,986
The weapon is almost certainly this bloody rock

177
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,362
found at the crime scene.

178
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:50,989
Were there fingerprints on the weapon?

179
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,658
None. But...

180
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:54,868
What?

181
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:57,454
We found traces of hand cream on the weapon.

182
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,289
Hand cream?

183
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,373
Yes.

184
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:03,168
Come to think of it, I heard those who work with books

185
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:06,087
frequently apply hand cream to prevent chapped hands.

186
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:06,129
What does that mean?

187
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,840
Ayumi gave him that notepaper

188
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,427
at Mizutani's house to combat silverfish.

189
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:15,639
I noticed the same thing

190
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,934
and suspected he was the thief.

191
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:21,144
What thief?

192
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:22,354
This afternoon,

193
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,523
some rare books were stolen from Mizutani's house.

194
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,319
-Is that true? -Yes.

195
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:32,948
So the victim stole the books from Mizutani's house

196
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:34,616
and came here to sell them.

197
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:37,452
That's why I attempted to call the police.

198
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:40,830
But he rushed out of the store.

199
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,334
Later, he called me to tell me to come to the park.

200
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,628
I see.

201
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:47,629
What?

202
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,135
What is it, Conan?

203
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:56,638
Could you show me that phone again?

204
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,223
What?

205
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:00,016
You're hopeless.

206
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,142
Thank you.

207
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:07,023
I knew it.

208
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:10,735
The black stain in the photo isn't on the actual book.

209
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:13,530
Which means...

210
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,240
There's no scratch on the lens.

211
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,828
What's this?

212
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:21,246
A button?

213
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:23,415
Hey, wait.

214
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:25,041
What is it, Chiba?

215
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,544
There were signs the victim was involved in a struggle.

216
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:30,422
One of his buttons were missing.

217
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:32,924
That must be it.

218
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:35,844
Mr. Tamaki, how do you explain this?

219
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:41,433
We got into a bit of a tussle when I tried to call the police.

220
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,351
It's possible it came off then.

221
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:46,730
Why didn't you mention that?

222
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,939
Because...

223
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,027
Hello?

224
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:54,029
Yes.

225
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,615
Yes. Understood.

226
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:01,953
It was a match for the hand cream on the weapon.

227
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,913
What? No way.

228
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,333
You fought with the victim,

229
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:10,920
and your hand cream matched the cream found on the weapon.

230
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,424
Given all the circumstantial evidence,

231
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,051
Mr. Yujiro Tamaki,

232
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,428
could you come down to the station with us?

233
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:19,554
No way.

234
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:22,015
There must be some mistake.

235
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,433
What will you do?

236
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,935
At this rate, they really will arrest him.

237
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:29,647
I know, but I haven't found anything conclusive yet.

238
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:34,235
Oh, no. I left the water boiling.

239
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,613
It's fine. I'll turn it off.

240
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:40,742
Thank you.

241
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,418
Looks like you figured it out.

242
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,754
Yeah.

243
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,048
Wait one moment.

244
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:58,343
Mr. Yujiro isn't the culprit.

245
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,638
But the circumstantial evidence...

246
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:05,850
Hand cream is oil-based. It repels water.

247
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,853
If he held the weapon with a hand coated in cream,

248
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:10,438
and bludgeoned the victim,

249
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:13,233
the section the cream stuck to would repel water.

250
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,944
No blood would be on it.

251
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,446
But forensics reported that

252
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:20,740
there was cream found on the bloody section.

253
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,536
In other words, the cream was applied

254
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,538
after the victim was struck.

255
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,540
But why?

256
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,041
Isn't it obvious?

257
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:34,045
So the real culprit could frame Mr. Yujiro.

258
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:36,923
Who's the real culprit?

259
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:42,220
The real culprit is the other person involved in the book theft.

260
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,931
The other person?

261
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:50,145
Take another look at the picture on the victim's phone.

262
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:51,813
This is it.

263
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:56,317
See the dark spot on the photo?

264
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,613
You mean this?

265
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:04,325
But there's no stain on the actual book.

266
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,953
You're right. The actual book is clean.

267
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:11,124
In other words, the black spot was caused by a scratch

268
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,418
or stain on the lens.

269
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:18,131
However, I didn't find a scratch on the victim's phone lens.

270
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:20,842
In other words, a different camera

271
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:23,136
was used to take the photo.

272
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:28,850
I saw a photo with a similar dark spot in Mizutani's home.

273
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,728
You're right. You mean the pictures of the flowers.

274
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:35,231
Then the person who took this photo was...

275
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:39,152
Mizutani, could we take a look at your phone?

276
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,617
There's a scratch on the lens.

277
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:49,329
It proves Mizutani sent the photo of the rare books

278
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,750
to the victim and instructed him to steal them.

279
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,418
Well?

280
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:59,839
It's true. I had him steal them.

281
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,926
What? But why have your own books stolen?

282
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:07,347
To be precise, they aren't her books, but her husband's.

283
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:11,518
At first, she tried to sell the books while her husband

284
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,145
was in the hospital for some pocket money, but...

285
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:16,940
Mr. Yujiro declined to buy them.

286
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,650
Yes.

287
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,319
You're right about the book theft.

288
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,154
But the murder is different.

289
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:26,950
Or do you have evidence proving I killed him?

290
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,035
Your glasses.

291
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,245
My glasses?

292
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:33,039
When you went to turn off the stove,

293
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,750
the steam from the kettle hit your face.

294
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,629
Only one of your lenses fogged up.

295
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:44,217
Hand creams are sometimes used to prevent fogging.

296
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:49,222
When you applied the same hand cream as Mr. Yujiro's

297
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:53,017
to the weapon in order to frame him,

298
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:56,020
perhaps you accidentally got some of the cream

299
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,648
on one of your glasses lenses.

300
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,317
You're wrong!

301
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:04,028
If you applied the cream after striking him,

302
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:08,116
some blood should be mixed in with the cream.

303
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:11,119
If you carefully examine Mizutani's glasses,

304
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,745
I'm sure you'll find

305
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:16,124
traces of the victim's blood.

306
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:20,753
Mizutani, could we examine those glasses?

307
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,051
I did it.

308
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,928
I planned to have Sawada sell the books

309
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:32,348
and give him a bit of the money.

310
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:35,435
But when he learned the true value of the books,

311
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:38,313
he realized I was trying to cheat him.

312
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:40,523
He threatened to tell my husband everything

313
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:43,234
if I didn't give him more.

314
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,653
So you killed him to keep him quiet?

315
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:48,823
Yes. Even if I paid him a fair share,

316
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:51,826
he might continue to blackmail me.

317
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:54,746
Besides, if I paid him that much,

318
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,415
that would leave less for me.

319
00:17:57,415 --> 00:18:02,045
But why frame Mr. Tamaki?

320
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:05,923
If he'd just bought the books,

321
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:09,719
I wouldn't have needed him to steal them.

322
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:13,640
So I deliberately hid that paper in the books

323
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,933
when I had Sawada take them to be appraised.

324
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:20,229
I did it so he'd immediately realize he was the thief.

325
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:24,942
I calculated that they would get into a fight.

326
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:27,445
Then I brought Sawada to the park

327
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,739
and had him make the call.

328
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:32,617
I killed Sawada before Mr. Tamaki arrived

329
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:36,037
and called the police when he found the body.

330
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:39,248
I thought I'd gotten away with it.

331
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:10,715
"Class 1-B Seedlings"

332
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:12,717
What's this book?

333
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,553
It's our class anthology.

334
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:18,639
There aren't many of them, so it's definitely rare.

335
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:21,642
We think it might be valuable.

336
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:24,228
It's a good book,

337
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,814
but unfortunately, I can't assign a price to it.

338
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,649
What?

339
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,818
But if you become famous in a few years,

340
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:34,322
it'd be a different story.

341
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,949
Hold onto it until then.

342
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,534
Okay!

343
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,536
In five years, maybe?

344
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,330
Can you become famous in five years?

345
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,748
Sure you can.

346
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:47,251
"Next Episode" -Hey, wait.

347
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:50,630
This isn't a restaurant.

348
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:55,343
It's a bunny girl club.

349
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:58,638
There are black bunnies everywhere.

350
00:20:58,638 --> 00:21:00,348
I wouldn't have brought Conan

351
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:03,351
if I'd known it was this kind of place.

352
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:05,019
I'm fine.

353
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,441
Next Conan,

354
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:14,445
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 1)"

355
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:17,490
Next Conan's Hint:

356
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,367
"Bunny Girls"

357
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,202
Next week there's a 24-hour broadcast.

358
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:22,370
There's no Conan.

359
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,871
No Conan.
