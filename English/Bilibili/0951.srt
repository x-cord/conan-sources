1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,770
Heave ho! Heave ho!

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,170
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,570
The steam locomotive's moving.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,570
It's always so cool.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,970
"Yujiro Tamaki (65)" -Oh, no. It's already 11 am.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,270
Hurry, kids.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,070
Okay!

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,970
Heave ho! Heave ho!

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,570
Amidst the whistling,

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,370
a case occurs at everyone's favorite used bookstore.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,970
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,727
-Right? -Yeah.

17
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,427
For example,

18
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:40,327
only 500 copies of this book were published in 1920.

19
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:43,527
There are currently many copies on the market,

20
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,127
but this one is in good condition.

21
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,727
I don't care what they are.

22
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,227
Will you buy all of them?

23
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:53,027
Excuse me, but are these books yours?

24
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:55,827
No, they belong to my husband.

25
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:59,127
Does your husband know you're selling them?

26
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:03,027
Seems you don't have his permission.

27
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,327
It's fine. He's in the hospital.

28
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,827
They're just taking up space.

29
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:11,627
What? Are you saying you won't buy them?

30
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,427
No. Personally, I'd very much like to purchase them.

31
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:19,527
But please get your husband's permission to sell them.

32
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,627
Pretty, aren't they?

33
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:30,627
Yeah.

34
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:34,127
I took them using my phone's camera.

35
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,827
They're very good.

36
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,527
What happened?

37
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,227
There was a little bug inside a book.

38
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:43,627
That's a silverfish.

39
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,527
A silverfish? What's that?

40
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,927
Silverfish, written using the characters for paper and fish.

41
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:52,227
They're bugs that like to eat the glue in the binding of books.

42
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:55,127
They're fish even though they're bugs?

43
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,727
Look closely at its body.

44
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,027
With its silver scale-like skin

45
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:03,027
and the way it wiggles its body to move, it looks like...

46
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:06,027
Now that you mention it, it does look like a fish.

47
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,827
How filthy. What should I do?

48
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:13,127
It's all right. They're easily dealt with.

49
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:17,427
You need this and some kind of paper.

50
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:20,427
Mr. Yujiro, use this.

51
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:22,027
Thank you.

52
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,627
Then you do this.

53
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,527
It smells good.

54
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,227
Smells like lavender.

55
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:32,227
Silverfish dislike the smell of herbs, especially lavender.

56
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:37,927
Simply place a lavender-scented piece of paper in the bookshelf,

57
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:40,727
and the silverfish will go away.

58
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,127
Amazing!

59
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:44,427
How informative.

60
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,627
I should try that at home.

61
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:52,527
Well, we should get going.

62
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,327
Thank you for coming.

63
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,327
"Ryosuke Sawada (35)" -Welcome. Sit wherever you'd like.

64
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:10,727
How much are these books worth?

65
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:14,427
An appraisal? Let me see.

66
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:18,127
These are all rare books.

67
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,827
Excuse me.

68
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:22,227
Would they be worth 500,000 yen?

69
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,627
Don't be absurd.

70
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,027
It depends on their condition,

71
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:28,327
but all together they'd be worth over 200,000 yen.

72
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,027
That jerk...

73
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:33,827
I can't accurately appraise them without seeing them in person.

74
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:37,227
If possible, please bring them here.

75
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:41,027
I'll be waiting.

76
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:51,927
What a truly relaxing space.

77
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,927
"Ichiro Tamaki (35)" -Thank you for coming.

78
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,027
"Michiko Yoshikawa (27)" -Would you like another coffee?

79
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,327
I suppose I would.

80
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,727
Is Mr. Yujiro not here today?

81
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,727
He's in the back.

82
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,827
He's currently checking

83
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:07,227
and mending all the books he bought yesterday.

84
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,027
Hey, you came.

85
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:19,227
Are these books...

86
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:21,827
Yeah, they're Mizutani's books.

87
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:24,027
You bought the rare books, too?

88
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,727
No. Apparently

89
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,327
the husband asked that she not sell the rare books,

90
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:31,027
so I bought everything else.

91
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,727
Really?

92
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:36,527
Dad, someone named Mizutani is calling for you.

93
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,127
It's me.

94
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,527
What? Really?

95
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:45,927
No, nonsense.

96
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:49,127
I understand. I'll head there immediately.

97
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,927
Is something wrong?

98
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:53,027
The rare books were stolen.

99
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:54,627
What?

100
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:58,227
But why did she call you?

101
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:02,427
It seems she believes I stole them.

102
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,327
"Mizutani"

103
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,427
Hand over the books you stole!

104
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,427
Calm down.

105
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,127
Start by telling me what happened

106
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,227
when the books were stolen.

107
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,827
I went out for lunch with a friend today.

108
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,427
We finished eating around 1 pm.

109
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:22,527
I came home immediately and discovered

110
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,727
the window was broken and the books were missing.

111
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:29,127
You called the police, right?

112
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,227
Yes.

113
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,027
The police said it must've been a professional

114
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,027
based on how the window was broken.

115
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:36,527
I was at the store all day today.

116
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:39,427
I couldn't have stolen from you.

117
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:42,227
That confirms Mr. Yujiro's alibi.

118
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:43,727
We can't be sure yet.

119
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:46,327
He could've gotten someone to steal them.

120
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,727
I wouldn't do that.

121
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,527
Those books were at our house for nearly twenty years.

122
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:55,027
But the moment you appraised them, they were stolen.

123
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,227
How do you explain that?

124
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,527
Well...

125
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,727
She really suspected him.

126
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,127
I know.

127
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:09,927
Hey, let's catch the real culprit.

128
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:13,327
Now, now. Let the police handle the investigation.

129
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,627
-What? -What is it?

130
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:17,627
I can't find my phone.

131
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,127
It must be at the cafe.

132
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,827
Should we go back to get it?

133
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,227
Someone's probably still at the store.

134
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:26,227
Sorry. Could we do that?

135
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:34,227
I'm sorry, but the store is closed for...

136
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:37,427
You came to get some books appraised the other day.

137
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:40,327
I want to know their exact value.

138
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:44,227
Very well. Allow me to take a look.

139
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:49,827
These are truly good books.

140
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,127
They're in good condition.

141
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,127
You can get a good price for these.

142
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:58,127
Anyway, what a coincidence.

143
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:03,527
I just recently appraised the same book.

144
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,927
I wasn't expecting to appraise them two days in a row.

145
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:08,127
Oh, no.

146
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,727
Sir, where did you get these books?

147
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,827
What does it matter? Hurry up and appraise them.

148
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,327
You stole these from Mizutani's house, didn't you?

149
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:23,627
No!

150
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:26,827
I'm sorry, but I'll be calling the police.

151
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,427
What? These are my books!

152
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,627
You can tell that to the police.

153
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:33,527
Wait.

154
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:34,827
Stop.

155
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,427
Did something happen?

156
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,027
Let's check it out.

157
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,627
Is it a case?

158
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:57,527
Mr. Yujiro.

159
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,927
Mr. Yujiro, are you hurt?

160
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,827
You kids again?

161
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:05,827
We came to the cafe next door to get something.

162
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,627
Then we saw the crowd.

163
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:11,327
This isn't my blood.

164
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,627
Then...

165
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:18,027
He's a suspect in this case.

166
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:19,827
What?

167
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:29,227
What's going on?

168
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,427
I called the police.

169
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:34,327
She discovered the body.

170
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:39,427
I clearly saw him standing next to the body.

171
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:43,527
Inspector Megure, we've identified the man.

172
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:46,627
The victim was Ryosuke Sawada, 35 years old.

173
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:49,827
He lives nearby and is unemployed.

174
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,527
What's the cause of death?

175
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:54,327
A cerebral contusion caused by a blow to the head.

176
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:57,827
The weapon is almost certainly this bloody rock

177
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,227
found at the crime scene.

178
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:00,827
Were there fingerprints on the weapon?

179
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:03,527
None. But...

180
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:04,727
What?

181
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,327
We found traces of hand cream on the weapon.

182
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,127
Hand cream?

183
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,227
Yes.

184
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:13,027
Come to think of it, I heard those who work with books

185
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:15,937
frequently apply hand cream to prevent chapped hands.

186
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:15,994
What does that mean?

187
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:18,694
Ayumi gave him that notepaper

188
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:22,294
at Mizutani's house to combat silverfish.

189
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,494
I noticed the same thing

190
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:28,794
and suspected he was the thief.

191
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,994
What thief?

192
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:32,194
This afternoon,

193
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:35,394
some rare books were stolen from Mizutani's house.

194
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:39,194
-Is that true? -Yes.

195
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:42,794
So the victim stole the books from Mizutani's house

196
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,494
and came here to sell them.

197
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:47,294
That's why I attempted to call the police.

198
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:50,694
But he rushed out of the store.

199
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:54,194
Later, he called me to tell me to come to the park.

200
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,494
I see.

201
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:57,494
What?

202
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,994
What is it, Conan?

203
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:06,494
Could you show me that phone again?

204
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,094
What?

205
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:09,894
You're hopeless.

206
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:10,994
Thank you.

207
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,894
I knew it.

208
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:20,594
The black stain in the photo isn't on the actual book.

209
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:23,394
Which means...

210
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:25,094
There's no scratch on the lens.

211
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,694
What's this?

212
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,094
A button?

213
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,294
Hey, wait.

214
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,894
What is it, Chiba?

215
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,394
There were signs the victim was involved in a struggle.

216
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,294
One of his buttons were missing.

217
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:42,794
That must be it.

218
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:45,694
Mr. Tamaki, how do you explain this?

219
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:51,294
We got into a bit of a tussle when I tried to call the police.

220
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:53,194
It's possible it came off then.

221
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:56,594
Why didn't you mention that?

222
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:57,794
Because...

223
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,894
Hello?

224
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,894
Yes.

225
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:07,494
Yes. Understood.

226
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:11,794
It was a match for the hand cream on the weapon.

227
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,794
What? No way.

228
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:16,194
You fought with the victim,

229
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:20,794
and your hand cream matched the cream found on the weapon.

230
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:24,294
Given all the circumstantial evidence,

231
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,894
Mr. Yujiro Tamaki,

232
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,294
could you come down to the station with us?

233
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:29,394
No way.

234
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,894
There must be some mistake.

235
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:33,294
What will you do?

236
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,794
At this rate, they really will arrest him.

237
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,494
I know, but I haven't found anything conclusive yet.

238
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:44,094
Oh, no. I left the water boiling.

239
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,494
It's fine. I'll turn it off.

240
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:50,594
Thank you.

241
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,294
Looks like you figured it out.

242
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:02,594
Yeah.

243
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,894
Wait one moment.

244
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:08,194
Mr. Yujiro isn't the culprit.

245
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,494
But the circumstantial evidence...

246
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:15,694
Hand cream is oil-based. It repels water.

247
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:18,694
If he held the weapon with a hand coated in cream,

248
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:20,294
and bludgeoned the victim,

249
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:23,094
the section the cream stuck to would repel water.

250
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:25,794
No blood would be on it.

251
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,294
But forensics reported that

252
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:30,594
there was cream found on the bloody section.

253
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:34,394
In other words, the cream was applied

254
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:36,394
after the victim was struck.

255
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:38,394
But why?

256
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:39,894
Isn't it obvious?

257
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:43,894
So the real culprit could frame Mr. Yujiro.

258
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:46,794
Who's the real culprit?

259
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:52,094
The real culprit is the other person involved in the book theft.

260
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,794
The other person?

261
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:59,994
Take another look at the picture on the victim's phone.

262
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,694
This is it.

263
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:06,194
See the dark spot on the photo?

264
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,494
You mean this?

265
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:14,194
But there's no stain on the actual book.

266
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,794
You're right. The actual book is clean.

267
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:20,994
In other words, the black spot was caused by a scratch

268
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:23,294
or stain on the lens.

269
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:27,994
However, I didn't find a scratch on the victim's phone lens.

270
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,694
In other words, a different camera

271
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,994
was used to take the photo.

272
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:38,694
I saw a photo with a similar dark spot in Mizutani's home.

273
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:41,594
You're right. You mean the pictures of the flowers.

274
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:45,094
Then the person who took this photo was...

275
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:48,994
Mizutani, could we take a look at your phone?

276
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,494
There's a scratch on the lens.

277
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:59,194
It proves Mizutani sent the photo of the rare books

278
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:03,594
to the victim and instructed him to steal them.

279
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:05,294
Well?

280
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:09,694
It's true. I had him steal them.

281
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:12,794
What? But why have your own books stolen?

282
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:17,194
To be precise, they aren't her books, but her husband's.

283
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:21,394
At first, she tried to sell the books while her husband

284
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,994
was in the hospital for some pocket money, but...

285
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:26,794
Mr. Yujiro declined to buy them.

286
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,494
Yes.

287
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:31,194
You're right about the book theft.

288
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:32,994
But the murder is different.

289
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:36,794
Or do you have evidence proving I killed him?

290
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,894
Your glasses.

291
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:40,094
My glasses?

292
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:42,894
When you went to turn off the stove,

293
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:45,594
the steam from the kettle hit your face.

294
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:49,494
Only one of your lenses fogged up.

295
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:54,094
Hand creams are sometimes used to prevent fogging.

296
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:59,094
When you applied the same hand cream as Mr. Yujiro's

297
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:02,894
to the weapon in order to frame him,

298
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:05,894
perhaps you accidentally got some of the cream

299
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,494
on one of your glasses lenses.

300
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:11,194
You're wrong!

301
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:13,894
If you applied the cream after striking him,

302
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:17,994
some blood should be mixed in with the cream.

303
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,994
If you carefully examine Mizutani's glasses,

304
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:22,594
I'm sure you'll find

305
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:25,994
traces of the victim's blood.

306
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:30,594
Mizutani, could we examine those glasses?

307
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,894
I did it.

308
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:38,794
I planned to have Sawada sell the books

309
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:42,194
and give him a bit of the money.

310
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:45,294
But when he learned the true value of the books,

311
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:48,194
he realized I was trying to cheat him.

312
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,394
He threatened to tell my husband everything

313
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:53,094
if I didn't give him more.

314
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,494
So you killed him to keep him quiet?

315
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:58,694
Yes. Even if I paid him a fair share,

316
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:01,694
he might continue to blackmail me.

317
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,594
Besides, if I paid him that much,

318
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:07,294
that would leave less for me.

319
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:11,894
But why frame Mr. Tamaki?

320
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:15,794
If he'd just bought the books,

321
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:19,594
I wouldn't have needed him to steal them.

322
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:23,494
So I deliberately hid that paper in the books

323
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,794
when I had Sawada take them to be appraised.

324
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:30,094
I did it so he'd immediately realize he was the thief.

325
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:34,794
I calculated that they would get into a fight.

326
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,294
Then I brought Sawada to the park

327
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,594
and had him make the call.

328
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:42,494
I killed Sawada before Mr. Tamaki arrived

329
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:45,894
and called the police when he found the body.

330
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:49,094
I thought I'd gotten away with it.

331
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:20,594
"Class 1-B Seedlings"

332
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:22,594
What's this book?

333
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:25,394
It's our class anthology.

334
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:28,494
There aren't many of them, so it's definitely rare.

335
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:31,494
We think it might be valuable.

336
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,094
It's a good book,

337
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:36,694
but unfortunately, I can't assign a price to it.

338
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,494
What?

339
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:40,694
But if you become famous in a few years,

340
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:44,194
it'd be a different story.

341
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:46,794
Hold onto it until then.

342
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:48,394
Okay!

343
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,394
In five years, maybe?

344
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:52,194
Can you become famous in five years?

345
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,594
Sure you can.

346
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,094
"Next Episode" -Hey, wait.

347
00:23:57,094 --> 00:24:00,494
This isn't a restaurant.

348
00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:05,194
It's a bunny girl club.

349
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,494
There are black bunnies everywhere.

350
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:10,194
I wouldn't have brought Conan

351
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:13,194
if I'd known it was this kind of place.

352
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:14,894
I'm fine.

353
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:20,294
Next Conan,

354
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:24,294
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 1)"

355
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:27,337
Next Conan's Hint:

"Bunny Girls"

357
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,037
Next week there's a 24-hour broadcast.

358
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,237
There's no Conan.

359
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,737
No Conan.
