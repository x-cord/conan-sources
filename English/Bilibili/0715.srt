1
00:00:01.224 --> 00:00:05.424
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:08.624
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.924
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:14.124
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.324
With the whereabouts of the owner of the mansion still unknown,

6
00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:20.524
when the family takes a family photograph,

7
00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:22.024
the eerie owner of the mansion

8
00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.124
who wasn't supposed to be there was in it.

9
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:28.124
After that, everyone gets text mail from the owner

10
00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.224
asking them to gather in the dining room,

11
00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:31.924
where they witness the eerie figure of the owner

12
00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:35.424
floating in mid air and a monster flying through the sky.

13
00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:39.924
Then later, the second son's dead body is found.

14
00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:42.124
Moreover, the dead body of the oldest daughter

15
00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:43.524
is found in the forest

16
00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:46.224
and the remaining siblings wait for the break of dawn

17
00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:49.324
in each of their rooms. However...

18
00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:52.224
I'm sure the culprit is that person.

19
00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:53.524
Right, Kudo?

20
00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:54.824
Yeah.

21
00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:57.124
But we have no proof.

22
00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.624
How did that person go pass the gate

23
00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:03.324
and kill Kamiyo in the forest?

24
00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:08.024
Aim for a 100% solution.

25
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:10.224
Clear all mysteries and codes.

26
00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:12.224
The sharp deductions of the two

27
00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:14.224
shed light on the darkness of the vampire case.

28
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:15.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:17.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:20.524
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:10.462
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Four)"

32
00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:15.062
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:19.162
I was going to let her drink sake and calm her down

34
00:03:19.162 --> 00:03:21.062
but she seems to have fallen asleep

35
00:03:21.062 --> 00:03:22.462
so you can put it away already.

36
00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:24.162
Oh, is that so...

37
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:27.362
I'm sorry, after you brought it all this way...

38
00:03:27.362 --> 00:03:29.062
Oh, no problem.

39
00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:33.962
"Torakura Ruri (38), Asanobu's wife"

40
00:03:33.962 --> 00:03:36.962
How about you, Kishiharu? Would like some sake?

41
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.462
No, none for me.

42
00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:43.162
I'll go back to my room, lock the door and hit the sack.

43
00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:47.262
I've stopped drinking ever since Yoko's accident.

44
00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:48.562
-"Hinohara Hikaru (24), Household Maid" -I see.

45
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.762
I told you to get out!

46
00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:52.362
Johei.

47
00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:55.062
Leave me alone.

48
00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:56.262
Really, I tell you.

49
00:03:56.262 --> 00:03:58.862
I just wanted to comfort you.

50
00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:01.062
What's with you?

51
00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:04.462
Aren't you sad despite your older sister being killed?

52
00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:08.562
I guess so. But, she's only my half-sister.

53
00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:11.862
And she was a formidable love rival too.

54
00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:17.862
You mean you think that we were meant to be together after all.

55
00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:19.262
You gotta be joking!

56
00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:22.462
How cute!

57
00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:26.862
My, sake.

58
00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:27.962
May I have it?

59
00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:29.762
Oh, sure.

60
00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:33.562
I feel like drinking tonight, you see.

61
00:04:40.362 --> 00:04:43.362
-"Gunma Prefectural Police" -What? Another one since then?

62
00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:44.862
Has been killed?

63
00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:46.362
Are you serious, Heiji?

64
00:04:46.362 --> 00:04:47.362
Yeah.

65
00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:50.962
The gate guard heard the ringtone of a cell phone in the forest.

66
00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:53.362
I hope my daughter's okay?

67
00:04:53.362 --> 00:04:57.662
Of course. She's carefreely making pot sticks with Kazuha.

68
00:04:57.662 --> 00:04:58.762
Pot sticks?

69
00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.762
And? You haven't figure out who the culprit is yet?

70
00:05:01.762 --> 00:05:02.862
Yes...

71
00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:04.862
I know already!

72
00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:05.862
Yeah.

73
00:05:06.362 --> 00:05:09.562
That person's the only one capable of carrying out this trick!

74
00:05:09.562 --> 00:05:13.162
Then, hurry up arrest him and handcuff him!

75
00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:14.762
Handcuff.

76
00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:16.862
We can't.

77
00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:21.562
We've got no proof, and an unsolved trick still remains.

78
00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:24.262
Do you think anyone can go out of the gate

79
00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:26.062
without being seen by any one,

80
00:05:26.062 --> 00:05:31.162
strangle somebody then sneak back pass the gate again?

81
00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:32.362
Huh?

82
00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:35.462
Of course, sensors are set up on the fence,

83
00:05:35.462 --> 00:05:39.462
and if someone tries to go over it, they'd be caught immediately.

84
00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:40.962
The only time the gate guards left their post

85
00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:43.662
was when the tunnel collapsed.

86
00:05:43.662 --> 00:05:44.662
How about it?

87
00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.462
Maybe the culprit killed Kamiyo inside the fence,

88
00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:52.262
then threw her out and fled?

89
00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:53.362
Idiot!

90
00:05:53.362 --> 00:05:55.562
How much strength do you think the culprit will need?

91
00:05:57.862 --> 00:06:00.362
There's something on my knees.

92
00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:04.762
When I checked Kamiyo's body in the forest and got on my knees...

93
00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:05.962
But, what is this?

94
00:06:05.962 --> 00:06:07.962
This white crystallized substance.

95
00:06:07.962 --> 00:06:09.562
Mixed with mud.

96
00:06:10.762 --> 00:06:12.362
The feel of this...

97
00:06:12.362 --> 00:06:14.562
could it be salt?

98
00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:17.462
But, what would this be in a place like that?

99
00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:20.462
But, no matter how much you train using a barbell at a gym,

100
00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:21.962
it's impossible, don't you think?

101
00:06:21.962 --> 00:06:23.962
The corpse was tied to a pole, you know!

102
00:06:24.962 --> 00:06:26.162
Bar...

103
00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:27.362
Barbell?

104
00:06:29.462 --> 00:06:32.062
So, now we know for sure.

105
00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:36.862
The culprit's not a vampire with wings.

106
00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:38.262
Yeah.

107
00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:40.462
They're a demon all right...

108
00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:42.862
But they're more of a bloodthirsty killer!

109
00:07:15.062 --> 00:07:17.462
Mail from the owner?

110
00:07:17.462 --> 00:07:19.362
Come to the European room so that I can tell you

111
00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:22.662
what I was going to talk to you about in the morning but couldn't.

112
00:07:22.662 --> 00:07:26.262
Of course come here without being noticed by anyone.

113
00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:28.362
Hakuya Torakura.

114
00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:30.462
I wonder what it's about?

115
00:07:30.462 --> 00:07:34.962
Maybe he's fine and knows who the real culprit is?

116
00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:37.962
But, he sure looked like a vampire to me, though.

117
00:07:37.962 --> 00:07:39.362
Hikaru.

118
00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:45.162
I would like to talk to you for a minute.

119
00:07:45.162 --> 00:07:47.262
Okay.

120
00:07:52.962 --> 00:07:55.362
I'm really getting sleepy.

121
00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:57.762
Oh, no! It's already 5:00 in the morning.

122
00:07:57.762 --> 00:07:59.662
No good, we've got to go to sleep right away!

123
00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:03.362
Oh, the phone. It's from Heiji!

124
00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:06.062
What is it, Heiji? Are you hungry?

125
00:08:06.062 --> 00:08:08.762
There are still plenty of pot sticks, you know!

126
00:08:08.762 --> 00:08:09.762
Huh?

127
00:08:11.062 --> 00:08:14.062
Okay... okay.

128
00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.462
I got it!

129
00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:17.562
You can count on me!

130
00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:20.462
What did Hattori want?

131
00:08:20.462 --> 00:08:23.562
Ran, do you have a hairpin?

132
00:08:23.562 --> 00:08:24.562
Huh?

133
00:08:35.462 --> 00:08:37.162
Sir...

134
00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:39.362
Sir!

135
00:08:39.362 --> 00:08:40.962
This is Hikaru.

136
00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:44.162
I've come after reading the mail.

137
00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:46.462
Sir.

138
00:08:51.862 --> 00:08:53.062
With this...

139
00:08:53.062 --> 00:08:54.962
This is it!

140
00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:11.562
Uh...

141
00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:13.062
Are you all right?

142
00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:15.262
Don't come out!

143
00:09:15.262 --> 00:09:18.062
The only thing you need to help us with is your voice!

144
00:09:18.062 --> 00:09:19.462
Yes.

145
00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:20.762
Huh?

146
00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:22.662
He's gone.

147
00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.662
True.

148
00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.662
He's vanished.

149
00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.596
Darn.

150
00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.596
My body's stuck.

151
00:09:59.596 --> 00:10:00.996
Of course it is.

152
00:10:01.996 --> 00:10:05.796
That's the corridor that the owner made for Hikaru.

153
00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:08.696
Of course it wouldn't fit your body.

154
00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:11.696
Mr. Johei Hagawa?

155
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:18.096
The fact that the owner gave Hikaru clothes as gifts

156
00:10:18.096 --> 00:10:22.196
means that he knew her size.

157
00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:23.296
Right.

158
00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:25.596
The tragedy that occurred tonight, the serial killings

159
00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:28.196
was what the owner had entrusted Hikaru to execute.

160
00:10:28.196 --> 00:10:30.196
He texted Hikaru to come to the European room this morning

161
00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:34.796
so that he could explain all the tricks that were used up to now.

162
00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:36.696
But, you snatched everything from the side, didn't you?

163
00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:40.996
You saw the mail from the owner on Hikaru's cell phone

164
00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:45.796
that was being charged in the bathroom!

165
00:10:45.796 --> 00:10:48.096
It seems that Hikaru didn't see that mail

166
00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:50.996
until after noon today, you see.

167
00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:53.096
What makes you think it was me?

168
00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:57.196
Kishiharu who came before noon could've seen it too, right?

169
00:10:57.196 --> 00:10:59.096
The contents of the mail

170
00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:02.996
was for her to come to the European room after breakfast.

171
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.296
Even if he did see that mail before noon,

172
00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:08.296
he would think that the owner wouldn't be waiting already, right?

173
00:11:08.296 --> 00:11:10.596
And, even if that mail were to be unread,

174
00:11:10.596 --> 00:11:12.496
the two could've coincidentally met somewhere,

175
00:11:12.496 --> 00:11:14.896
and finished what they were going to talk about already.

176
00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:18.096
Or, he could've thought that the owner who was stood,

177
00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.696
decided to forget about it and go to sleep.

178
00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:21.796
If anyone were to have seen that mail

179
00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:24.196
and go to the European room,

180
00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:27.396
you and Kamiyo who were there since the night before,

181
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:28.996
were the only ones who would've gone.

182
00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:30.896
Since Kamiyo was killed,

183
00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:34.096
the only one left would be you!

184
00:11:34.096 --> 00:11:37.996
There's a possibility that the butler and maids also saw it but...

185
00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:39.896
being that the owner was trying to relay

186
00:11:39.896 --> 00:11:42.796
something so important by texting means that...

187
00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:45.396
he must've been convince that there is no one

188
00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:47.196
in this mansion who would do something so atrocious

189
00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:49.396
as to read another person's mail without permission.

190
00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:53.396
So, you, being concerned of what the talk was about

191
00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:56.896
snuck over to the European room and saw it.

192
00:11:56.896 --> 00:11:59.696
That the owner had cut off his own neck with the guillotine

193
00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:01.496
and died.

194
00:12:03.896 --> 00:12:06.896
I'm sure it was near the corpse of the owner, right?

195
00:12:06.896 --> 00:12:10.196
His cell phone, the key to the freezer

196
00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:12.796
and the switch to explode the tunnel

197
00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:15.496
with this plan of carrying out the serial killings.

198
00:12:15.496 --> 00:12:18.496
Stop talking like you saw me doing it!

199
00:12:18.496 --> 00:12:21.096
But this serial killing

200
00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:23.696
is something that cannot be carried out

201
00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:26.296
unless Hakuya cuts his neck off.

202
00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:28.996
One of them is the trick when he suddenly

203
00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:31.296
vanished from the coffin!

204
00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:34.896
If he did it on his own, it would've been easy but...

205
00:12:34.896 --> 00:12:37.496
if somebody did it using his corpse,

206
00:12:37.496 --> 00:12:40.796
it had to be done using only his head.

207
00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:46.096
We got to him as soon as we heard

208
00:12:46.096 --> 00:12:48.696
Kazuha and Ran scream.

209
00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:51.896
I'll bet you snuck over to the storeroom down stairs,

210
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.696
and retrieved the head of the corpse

211
00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:55.596
using the hidden corridor.

212
00:12:55.596 --> 00:12:57.596
The only thing that Kazuha saw that was real

213
00:12:57.596 --> 00:12:59.296
was probably just the head,

214
00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:01.196
and as to his clothes, you probably stuffed something inside

215
00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:03.596
to make it look real.

216
00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:05.396
If his body was real too,

217
00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:07.696
when you pulled his body out of the coffin,

218
00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:11.096
it'd have swayed and made noises.

219
00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:13.896
You then used the remote controller

220
00:13:13.896 --> 00:13:16.196
to unlock the lid of the coffin,

221
00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.596
and while everyone was taken aback in surprise

222
00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:19.596
about Hakuya's body having vanished.

223
00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:21.396
You took Hakuya's head over to the closet

224
00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:25.396
where the family picture was going to be taken, didn't you?

225
00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:28.596
In order to come up with that psychic picture that was taken.

226
00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:32.696
There is a bar in the closet to hang clothes on to begin with

227
00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:35.096
so it's easy to hang his head on it too.

228
00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:36.796
You came later than everyone to the coffin room

229
00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:40.196
because you had to do all this, right?

230
00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.896
That psychic picture.

231
00:13:42.896 --> 00:13:46.296
Since you were beside the magic mirror,

232
00:13:46.296 --> 00:13:47.996
you could've positioned yourself

233
00:13:47.996 --> 00:13:51.896
so that Kamiyo wouldn't be reflected in the mirror too.

234
00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:54.596
Back then, if you had the remote controller

235
00:13:54.596 --> 00:13:57.996
to light up Hakuya's face that was in the closet,

236
00:13:57.996 --> 00:14:00.296
by using the right timing.

237
00:14:00.296 --> 00:14:03.096
It would've been possible for you to make Hakuya's face

238
00:14:03.096 --> 00:14:04.996
emerge on the mirror!

239
00:14:05.796 --> 00:14:07.796
And the last trick was

240
00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:09.996
when Hakuya appeared by the dining room window

241
00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:12.596
hanging upside down!

242
00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:14.496
A strange shadow?

243
00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:23.296
You waited for Asanaobu at the smoking room,

244
00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:26.396
waited for a chance to cut open his artery

245
00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:28.296
and killed him then.

246
00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:30.496
You pulled a fishing line through the hinge

247
00:14:30.496 --> 00:14:31.996
of the sliding storm shutter of the smoking room

248
00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:35.396
and hung down both ends of the line to the dining room below.

249
00:14:35.396 --> 00:14:38.296
You tied Hakuya's head onto one end of the line

250
00:14:38.296 --> 00:14:42.296
then hooked the other end to the frame of the window, right?

251
00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:43.796
By doing this, when the window was opened,

252
00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:46.796
the line would come off and his head would fall down.

253
00:14:47.296 --> 00:14:48.896
Hold it!

254
00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:52.596
When I opened the window, the head vanished above, didn't it?

255
00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:56.596
If that was only his head,

256
00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:59.996
maybe somebody was upstairs and pulled it up?

257
00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:01.596
Convex lens.

258
00:15:02.296 --> 00:15:04.796
The upper right pane of that window alone

259
00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:07.796
was made of convex lens, just like a magnifying glass.

260
00:15:07.796 --> 00:15:09.596
If through that lens depending on the angle,

261
00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.696
the object looks upside down.

262
00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:16.696
That's why although it fell down, it looked like it went up!

263
00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:19.596
Moreover, the three panes below the convex lens

264
00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:21.596
are ordinary glass.

265
00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:24.396
Of course, if the head looked as if it fell down,

266
00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:25.696
the trick won't work.

267
00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:29.296
That's why this trick couldn't have been done by anyone

268
00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:31.996
other than you, who blocked the view of the lower three panes

269
00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:34.396
with your own body at the time.

270
00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:37.796
The head finally fell into the pot that was together

271
00:15:37.796 --> 00:15:40.796
with the planters on the veranda outside the window.

272
00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:44.596
When we went to look afterwards, that jar was placed aside

273
00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:47.696
and Hakuya's head was still inside.

274
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.296
Well, we wouldn't have realized this, unless Hikaru

275
00:15:50.296 --> 00:15:53.396
told us that she saw the silhouette of Hakuya's head

276
00:15:53.396 --> 00:15:55.996
through the curtains

277
00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:57.796
during the flash of lightning come from below.

278
00:15:57.796 --> 00:16:01.996
The big bird that we saw outside the window right after was...

279
00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:03.696
A plane with flapping wings!

280
00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:07.296
If you left it on the roof outside of the smoking room

281
00:16:07.296 --> 00:16:09.496
and started its motor by a remote

282
00:16:09.496 --> 00:16:12.596
just before opening the window...

283
00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.996
It'd fly away in the sky just as you open the window

284
00:16:14.996 --> 00:16:17.696
and that was your setup.

285
00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:20.096
Well, as to the plane, I'm sure we'll find it

286
00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:21.696
somewhere in the forest later.

287
00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:25.696
Then what about Honey who killed in the forest?

288
00:16:25.696 --> 00:16:28.196
Are you saying that I did that too?

289
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:30.696
The gate guard only left the post for an instant

290
00:16:30.696 --> 00:16:33.296
but Honey was tied to a pole, wasn't she?

291
00:16:33.296 --> 00:16:35.796
How could I do something like that

292
00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:37.296
when I never once left the mansion?

293
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:39.996
The wheels made of ice!

294
00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:44.096
On both ends of the pole that Kamiyo was tied on,

295
00:16:44.096 --> 00:16:47.296
you attached wheels of ice onto it like barbells.

296
00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:49.396
Then, while the gate guards

297
00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:51.896
were distracted by the explosion of the tunnel,

298
00:16:51.896 --> 00:16:55.396
you rolled it down from the stairs right in front of the gate.

299
00:16:56.296 --> 00:16:59.696
The corpse while getting its fingertips all jammed up,

300
00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:00.696
went pass the gate,

301
00:17:00.696 --> 00:17:03.596
bumped into the trees and stopped in the forest!

302
00:17:03.596 --> 00:17:06.596
All you had to do after that was, wait for the ice to melt,

303
00:17:06.596 --> 00:17:08.596
ring Kamiyo's cell phone

304
00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:11.796
and make the gate guards find her corpse.

305
00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:15.696
It's humid tonight and it was also raining.

306
00:17:15.696 --> 00:17:18.596
On top of that it seemed you mixed salt into the ice

307
00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:20.596
to make it melt faster too!

308
00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:25.696
By the way, you made the ice wheels using the locked freezer!

309
00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:29.696
You stood a can of laver in the center of a toy pool

310
00:17:29.696 --> 00:17:32.796
then partitioned them with a sheet of paper or something

311
00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:34.896
to make two wheels, didn't you?

312
00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:38.096
You took the ice wheels from the freezer

313
00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:41.396
then rolled them over to the stairs so...

314
00:17:41.396 --> 00:17:43.696
the flour that Ran and Kazuha spilled on the floor

315
00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:47.196
wiped off leaving a track just the width of the wheels behind.

316
00:17:47.196 --> 00:17:49.596
Gosh, these kids have the nerve

317
00:17:49.596 --> 00:17:51.696
to line up such nonsense despite no proof.

318
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.596
You've got the proof, don't you?

319
00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:59.396
You didn't delete Hakuya's mail from Hikaru's cell phone

320
00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:02.096
because you wanted to frame her later.

321
00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:04.196
Hey.

322
00:18:04.196 --> 00:18:06.696
That's why in order to shut Hikaru up,

323
00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:09.296
we figured you'd be luring her out somewhere.

324
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:11.196
"To Hikaru"

325
00:18:11.196 --> 00:18:17.396
Together with this murder plan sheet that he made!

326
00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:22.696
That's the proof, Mr. Johei Hagawa.

327
00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:24.796
On this plan sheet it says

328
00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:27.896
to call Mr. Hagawa over to the European room, kill him,

329
00:18:27.896 --> 00:18:32.596
then lock the room and leave.

330
00:18:32.596 --> 00:18:34.096
Just as written on the plan sheet, you acted out

331
00:18:34.096 --> 00:18:36.096
being called over to the European room by Hikaru,

332
00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:37.296
and wanted everybody to think that

333
00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:41.796
you killed her in self defense because she attacked you.

334
00:18:41.796 --> 00:18:45.296
So, if you placed the plan sheet next to Hikaru's corpse

335
00:18:45.296 --> 00:18:47.196
and called everybody over,

336
00:18:47.196 --> 00:18:50.596
that would complete the scenario that you counter-attacked

337
00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:53.796
the killer who was planning to kill you!

338
00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:55.296
Darn.

339
00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:57.496
How'd these brats get to all this...

340
00:18:57.496 --> 00:19:00.096
It would've worked out well otherwise.

341
00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:03.296
We thought there was something fishy about you

342
00:19:03.296 --> 00:19:04.796
ever since you insisted on

343
00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:07.696
having the blood stain on the coffin checked more carefully.

344
00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:09.196
Why?

345
00:19:09.196 --> 00:19:10.696
That blood was the blood that dripped

346
00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:12.696
when I put the head into the coffin.

347
00:19:12.696 --> 00:19:15.396
The police investigated and concluded that

348
00:19:15.396 --> 00:19:17.096
it wasn't Hakuya's blood!

349
00:19:17.096 --> 00:19:19.196
The police goofed on it, didn't they?

350
00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:20.996
The blood spot we found at the coffin back then,

351
00:19:20.996 --> 00:19:24.996
was it really of type AB?

352
00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.296
More than that, I think that

353
00:19:26.296 --> 00:19:29.296
you should check that blood a bit more carefully.

354
00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:31.196
Like for DNA.

355
00:19:31.196 --> 00:19:33.896
Hakuya probably had cancer.

356
00:19:33.896 --> 00:19:36.196
In the final stages, it's possible that

357
00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:38.196
the blood type of the person changes.

358
00:19:38.196 --> 00:19:40.596
If the person has blood type A, he could become blood type AB.

359
00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.796
If blood type O, then type B.

360
00:19:42.796 --> 00:19:46.096
Being able to say that, this is a mistake to begin with...

361
00:19:46.096 --> 00:19:50.896
you have to be the one who put Hakuya's head into the coffin.

362
00:19:50.896 --> 00:19:54.696
Well, your blood type also changed because of this plan sheet.

363
00:19:54.696 --> 00:20:00.596
It seems to have changed into the blood of a ruthless killer.

364
00:21:26.196 --> 00:21:28.696
My dear daughter?

365
00:21:28.696 --> 00:21:30.496
The beginning of that plan sheet,

366
00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:32.996
did it begin with the line, "My dear daughter"?

367
00:21:32.996 --> 00:21:36.096
Yeah. It seems that he lied to the butler

368
00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:38.596
who he figured was kenn, though.

369
00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:40.496
There's no mistake about it because

370
00:21:40.496 --> 00:21:44.396
a will and DNA certificate were found in his room.

371
00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:48.996
You mean he tried to make his real daughter commit a serial crime?

372
00:21:48.996 --> 00:21:50.196
That's right.

373
00:21:50.196 --> 00:21:52.096
After putting fangs on his teeth

374
00:21:52.096 --> 00:21:53.796
and making everyone believe that

375
00:21:53.796 --> 00:21:56.796
he did all this after turning into a vampire.

376
00:21:58.596 --> 00:22:00.296
His motive was to avenge the death of Yoko

377
00:22:00.296 --> 00:22:02.596
who was supposed to become his bride.

378
00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:06.396
It seems that Mr. Hagawa is talking his mouth off.

379
00:22:06.396 --> 00:22:09.296
Saying that the maid Ms. Shimizu, Kamiyo,

380
00:22:09.296 --> 00:22:13.696
Asanobu and himself schemed the accident that lead to Yoko's death.

381
00:22:13.696 --> 00:22:15.696
Which means that the murder of Ms. Shimizu

382
00:22:15.696 --> 00:22:17.596
that occurred six months ago...

383
00:22:17.596 --> 00:22:20.596
Was committed by Hakuya.

384
00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:25.096
It was written on the will that he sucked her blood.

385
00:22:25.096 --> 00:22:28.296
But since he was a doctor, he probably

386
00:22:28.296 --> 00:22:30.396
made her drink a drug to inhibit blood coagulation,

387
00:22:30.396 --> 00:22:32.796
then inserted a catheter into her artery

388
00:22:32.796 --> 00:22:34.796
and drained her blood.

389
00:22:34.796 --> 00:22:39.096
Besides, Hakuya probably tied Ms. Shimizu to the pole

390
00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:43.096
to camouflage the ice wheel trick.

391
00:22:43.096 --> 00:22:47.896
But, if Hikaru was the one who got to see the plan sheet first...

392
00:22:47.896 --> 00:22:50.196
Things would've been okay.

393
00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:52.996
This is what was written at the end of the plan sheet.

394
00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:56.296
"But if you decide to forgive everything and everyone,"

395
00:22:56.296 --> 00:22:59.496
"please burn this plan sheet along with the blaze of revenge"

396
00:22:59.496 --> 00:23:01.996
"that's been haunting me from deep within."

397
00:23:01.996 --> 00:23:05.796
I'm sure that Hikaru would've chosen to do just that!

398
00:23:05.796 --> 00:23:07.996
I bet.

399
00:23:07.996 --> 00:23:11.996
But, that guy called Hagawa is totally absurd.

400
00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:13.196
The nerve of him to kill his lover, Kamiyo,

401
00:23:13.196 --> 00:23:15.196
just as the plan sheet had it, seeing through the fact that

402
00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:16.996
Mina would want to get back together with him again,

403
00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:19.796
and that he would eventually get hold of the money.

404
00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:24.096
Well, there is no denying he was a foolish man.

405
00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:28.196
The least you can do is take good care of her.

406
00:23:28.196 --> 00:23:30.396
Women can be scary, you know.

407
00:23:30.396 --> 00:23:33.196
Huh, what on earth are you talking about?

408
00:23:38.996 --> 00:23:40.596
Wait.

409
00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:48.196
That smell...

410
00:23:48.196 --> 00:23:50.196
I wonder how many pot sticks they ate.

411
00:23:52.596 --> 00:23:57.696
The fact is, a letter like this was delivered to me.

412
00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:00.796
Mr. Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

413
00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:01.796
Huh?

414
00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:08.296
You can't trust anybody.

415
00:24:08.296 --> 00:24:13.296
But, I can trust the boy who saved my life.

416
00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:18.496
Next Conan,

417
00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:22.096
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 1)"

418
00:24:37.296 --> 00:24:39.696
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:39.696 --> 00:24:42.196
"Spoon"

420
00:24:42.196 --> 00:24:43.196
Good work, Kudo!

421
00:24:43.196 --> 00:24:45.296
After the pot sticks, it's okonomiyaki in Osaka.

422
00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:47.096
I mean, I wanna eat pot sticks.
