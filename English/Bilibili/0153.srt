1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:02,666
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:04,566
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,666
This episode features Sonoko in her natural state.

4
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:08,666
Danger, romance and fate awaits.

5
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,266
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,266
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,566
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,879
"Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story (Part 1)"

9
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,479
"Izu"

10
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:16,379
Perfect!

11
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,279
Sonoko, what in the world are you taking?

12
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:21,279
If it's a close up of your rear as you fixed your bathing suit,

13
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,779
a real close up!

14
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,179
It's eye catching!

15
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,479
Why did you take a shot like that?

16
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,179
It's obvious, isn't it?

17
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,679
When Shinichi gets back,

18
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,279
I'm going to show it to him!

19
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,779
What?

20
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,179
I'm sure he'll be thrilled!

21
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,279
You're nuts!

22
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,879
Shinichi would not be pleased by those pictures!

23
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,379
Conan, you agree with me don't you?

24
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,079
What?

25
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,179
Yes.

26
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:49,079
What does a kid know?

27
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,579
Good grief. I wish I were back to normal!

28
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,379
Sonoko, what's wrong with you?

29
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,879
You've been acting so mean lately!

30
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,379
Don't mind me.

31
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,579
I'm just jealous.

32
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,879
What? But, why?

33
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,779
Was it something I did?

34
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,679
Do you know why?

35
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:10,179
Do you know why we came here for these three days and two nights?

36
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:13,379
To look for guys, as always, that is your motive, isn't it, Sonoko?

37
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,479
That's right!

38
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,679
And this time, I've got my girl-next-door act perfect!

39
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,279
What?

40
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,079
What do you mean by that?

41
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,579
Whenever we travel,

42
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,579
we always stay at my family's vacation home or some fancy hotel.

43
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,079
"Gosh, The likes of her are beyond my reach!"

44
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,679
To relieve the fears of such men,

45
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:37,279
I deliberately picked this rundown inn for us this trip!

46
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,879
So that is what this is all about.

47
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,879
What a waste of energy.

48
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,079
And still...

49
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,479
Sonoko...

50
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,979
In the train coming over here,

51
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,679
at the fireworks display site near the inn last night,

52
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:57,379
and even here on the beach today...

53
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,979
All the guys that have come up to us,

54
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:04,279
every one of them were after you, Ran!

55
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,679
I don't think that's true...

56
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,479
Never mind, forget it!

57
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,779
I took some candid shots of you in your underwear.

58
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,679
I'll just show those to Shinichi too!

59
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,779
What?

60
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,179
Hold on!

61
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:16,879
Sonoko, wait!

62
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,079
I'll never forgive you if you do that!

63
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:23,779
I was just kidding...

64
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,379
I didn't take those pictures!

65
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,779
Sonoko, you little...

66
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,179
Good grief. She was lying.

67
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,979
Hey, ladies.

68
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,479
Are you free?

69
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,379
"Tadahiko Michiwaki" -How about having lunch with me?

70
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,079
Of course, it'll be my treat!

71
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,779
Yes! I'll be happy to...

72
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,579
I bet you're after Ran too. Aren't you?

73
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,079
-What? -Go ahead, take her!

74
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,579
She's at her prime!

75
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,679
Sonoko!

76
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,379
But don't try anything funny!

77
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,779
She's already got a boyfriend!

78
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,479
No. The one I was asking out...

79
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,079
was you.

80
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,479
You're kidding!

81
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,079
Isn't that great, Sonoko!

82
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,079
How exciting!

83
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,279
I don't believe it!

84
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,579
There is no way someone would pick Sonoko.

85
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,979
Something's fishy here.

86
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,079
There's got to be a catch somewhere!

87
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,879
But there is no sense worrying about it.

88
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,679
Shall we go?

89
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,979
I'll just stay here with Conan for a while longer.

90
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,979
"House of Sea"

91
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,279
So you're a student at Beika University!

92
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,979
Ran's father graduated from there!

93
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,279
Yes, that's right

94
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,579
I don't understand.

95
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,579
She always looking for guys

96
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,079
but when she's with one, she's so uptight.

97
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,279
So what brings you here to Izu?

98
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,679
I'm just getting over breaking up with my girlfriend.

99
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,379
She shattered my heart.

100
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,579
I felt so lost and was looking at the ocean.

101
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,579
Then I saw an angel.

102
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,079
If my instincts are correct,

103
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,779
you're going to turn out to be my savior.

104
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,679
Your savior...

105
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,279
Here's your beer! Sorry for keeping you waiting.

106
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,679
Thanks...

107
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,979
"Makoto Kyougoku" -Sir, please don't drop

108
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,879
your cigarette ashes on the floor!

109
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,679
It makes cleaning up harder!

110
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,779
Sure thing.

111
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,279
What a rude waiter.

112
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,779
Hey. Haven't we seen that waiter somewhere before?

113
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,579
Of course, we have.

114
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,579
His father owns the inn we're staying at!

115
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,679
I heard he comes back during the summer break to help out.

116
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,779
How do you know all this?

117
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,279
He was staring at us from the doorway

118
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,379
so I asked someone working at the inn!

119
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,779
Then I wonder why he's working here?

120
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,479
It's probably under the same management!

121
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,879
The Kawara Inn where we're staying...

122
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,379
So, you're staying at the Kawara Inn?

123
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,279
Yes, that's right.

124
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,879
Oh, my... That is so close to the hotel I'm staying at!

125
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,179
How about it then?

126
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,379
Why don't we all have dinner tonight

127
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,979
at that fancy restaurant on the beach,

128
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,679
I'll pick you up in my car!

129
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,879
Really? Are you sure?

130
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,179
On one condition, you bring your camera!

131
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,379
-What? -What? Why's that?

132
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,679
I just heard from one of the locals,

133
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:40,379
something happened on the beach close to the restaurant.

134
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,079
Like what?

135
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,779
Yes. It was almost a year ago to this date.

136
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,879
A young girl with long brown hair was murdered,

137
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,779
she'd been stabbed in the abdomen.

138
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,279
-Murdered? -Murdered?

139
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,579
Yes. It seems like she was attacked

140
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:59,179
while on her way to that restaurant

141
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,479
but there were no witnesses

142
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,079
and the case is still being investigated!

143
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,979
A year's gone by since the incident,

144
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,279
the customers have forgotten the incident

145
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,079
and business at the restaurant is booming, but...

146
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,379
There's one problem,

147
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,379
the girl seems to have taken a liking to the restaurant,

148
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,479
she still appears there even now.

149
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,679
She what?

150
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:26,079
Photos taken in the restaurant show her grotesque figure!

151
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,179
What a lie...

152
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,979
That's why I wanted to test the rumor

153
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,579
and see if such a picture'd turn out!

154
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,579
What do you think?

155
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:40,579
I still have about ten shots left...

156
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,779
No way! Don't you dare take your camera!

157
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,579
But if we showed it to Shinichi,

158
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,079
he could probably figure it out.

159
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,079
Besides, I'm going to show him

160
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,779
the other pictures I told you about are in this camera.

161
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,179
Listen to me!

162
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:56,779
That good will it does to show him pictures of someone unidentifiable!

163
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,279
With his deductive powers,

164
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,479
I'm sure he'll be able to figure out who it is in a snap.

165
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,579
Good grief!

166
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,279
Deductive powers?

167
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,779
This girl's boyfriend is a detective!

168
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,779
Oh, really?

169
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,379
By the way, what kind of photos are you talking about?

170
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,379
Wait until you hear...

171
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,779
Sonoko!

172
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,879
Here is your order! Fried noodles!

173
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,479
Customers are lining up so please eat fast!

174
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,479
That is it with that guy.

175
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,179
Does he have a grudge against us or something?

176
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,279
"Shoji Terabayashi"

177
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,379
Let's not go to that restaurant.

178
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,179
It's just too spooky.

179
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,879
Don't worry!

180
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,479
It's just a rumour.

181
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,579
Besides, a whole year's gone by since it happened!

182
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,679
If she did appear there as a ghost,

183
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,679
I'm sure she's grown tired of the place by now.

184
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,179
Hey, did you hear?

185
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,479
They found another one in the woods along the railroad tracks!

186
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,479
Another what?

187
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,979
A body!

188
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,979
Another girl with long brown hair's been murdered!

189
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,479
I'm going to have a look!

190
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,079
Conan, don't go!

191
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,679
Conan!

192
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,979
Good grief, he's so curious.

193
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,579
"Officer Yokomizo" -She's been stabbed in the abdomen.

194
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,879
Just like the victim last year.

195
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,579
Yes. This victim also seems to be a tourist.

196
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,279
By the way, what's the estimated time of death?

197
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,579
Let's see.

198
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,179
Sometime between 8 to 9 pm last night.

199
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,579
About the time the fireworks display ended.

200
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:44,579
What?

201
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,179
Isn't that about the time we passed here last night?

202
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,979
Yes, I think so.

203
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:53,479
That's scary.

204
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,879
Don't be silly. No one would attack you, Sonoko!

205
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,979
But look! I have brown hair too!

206
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:05,179
Can you guarantee I won't be the next victim?

207
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:09,079
I don't want to die in a place like this.

208
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,179
I haven't done any of the things I want to yet.

209
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,679
Sonoko.

210
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,279
Don't worry.

211
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,779
I'll protect you while we're here in Izu!

212
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,679
By the way, I think it'll be best to eat at a different restaurant.

213
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,579
You're right. And no cameras either!

214
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,479
I agree!

215
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,179
I'll pick you up at 7.

216
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,079
Wait for me in front of the inn!

217
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,579
Okay.

218
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,879
That man...

219
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,579
I'm sure he was at the beach side concession just now.

220
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,279
I'll see you later then.

221
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,679
All right! I'll be looking forward to tonight!

222
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,779
-Let's change and go back. -Okay.

223
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,779
Hey!

224
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,579
Why if it isn't Ran and Sonoko!

225
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:02,279
I didn't know you were in Izu.

226
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,179
Yes, we came to do some swimming.

227
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,179
So Detective Mouri is with you too?

228
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:10,179
No. Only the three of us came on this trip.

229
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:12,279
Three?

230
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,879
Hello.

231
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,179
So you're the one who is guarding these two ladies?

232
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,579
Stay on your toes.

233
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,179
Yes, sir!

234
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,279
And you two be careful too!

235
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,979
There has been a terrible crime.

236
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,879
Yes. We'll be careful.

237
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,079
I'll be going then!

238
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,479
Give Detective Mouri my regards.

239
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,679
I will!

240
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,679
He hasn't changed at all.

241
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,279
He's still energetic but somehow unreliable.

242
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,979
If your father were here,

243
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:48,579
he'd solve the crime in no time.

244
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:54,379
Trust me. Officer Yokomizo is more reliable than Pops Kogoro.

245
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,679
Oh, no! It's starting to rain!

246
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,179
I wish he'd come soon.

247
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,179
Patience, don't be so anxious!

248
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,379
Heroes always arrive late!

249
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,179
Stop that! You're embarrassing me.

250
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,579
What'd he put this umbrella here?

251
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,579
Does he mean we can use it?

252
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:39,079
Maybe he has a crush on you, Sonoko.

253
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,279
What?

254
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,879
Why, Sonoko... Aren't you the popular one!

255
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,479
For goodness sakes, he's so gloomy!

256
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:49,179
You're right. After all, you have Michiwaki, Sonoko!

257
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,179
Ran, stop. You're embarrassing me...

258
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,679
Oh, no! I left my purse in the room.

259
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,879
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

260
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,979
Okay.

261
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,279
What's the matter, Ran?

262
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:13,679
That guy wearing the glasses...

263
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,579
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.

264
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,479
Yes. Probably in this inn.

265
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,979
No. Not here.

266
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:23,279
Somewhere else...

267
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:33,979
Are you sure?

268
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,179
Yes...

269
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,679
Where?

270
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,279
Where did you see him, think, Ran!

271
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,579
Ran!

272
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,969
Sonoko, what's keeping you?

273
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,769
Don't tell me you're changing your clothes...

274
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,769
Sonoko! What happened?

275
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:26,269
A man attacked and ran out through the window!

276
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:27,369
What?

277
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:33,669
Darn it! He got away.

278
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,769
I was so scared!

279
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,469
Why would someone attack you?

280
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,969
I don't know.

281
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,769
When I opened the door to this room,

282
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,869
that man was going through our things,

283
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:46,769
I was going to scream but he grabbed me!

284
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,869
Going through their things?

285
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:50,669
He probably wanted to steal our underwear!

286
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:51,669
The pervert!

287
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,569
What did he look like?

288
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:54,769
You saw his face, didn't you?

289
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,069
I didn't have a chance!

290
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,769
Besides, the room was dark

291
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,669
and I was so scared that I nearly fainted.

292
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:04,069
But, how'd you know it was a man, Sonoko?

293
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:06,769
While we were struggling, I bit him!

294
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,469
Right on his hairy upper arm!

295
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,869
Nice going...

296
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:14,669
What's going on?

297
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,769
What are you doing in the dark?

298
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,369
Michiwaki...

299
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,969
My car engine had problem on the way

300
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:24,369
so I ran over, sorry I'm late.

301
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,869
But how'd you know this was our room?

302
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,069
You weren't waiting at the entrance

303
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,069
so I asked the clerk.

304
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,269
His shirt's wet...

305
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,169
And his pants are splattered with dirt.

306
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,669
Could it be...

307
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,969
Michiwaki, can you take your shirt off?

308
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:41,969
What?

309
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,369
I want to see your upper arm.

310
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,369
Conan.

311
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:48,169
I don't know what's going on

312
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,969
but is there something on my arm?

313
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,669
Nothing?

314
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,769
There's no sign of Sonoko's bite.

315
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,769
Satisfied now, kid?

316
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,169
Is something wrong here, folks?

317
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,369
He's bandaged.

318
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,669
That happened to your arm?

319
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,969
Oh, this. A guest got drunk and bit me the other night.

320
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,369
When was that?

321
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,869
Please answer me!

322
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,069
I don't think he's the one.

323
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,169
The man who attacked me was pretty hairy.

324
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,469
You were attacked?

325
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:25,169
Yes! A man came in through that window

326
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,069
and was searching through our things.

327
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,669
Sonoko just happened to come back to the room

328
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,369
and she was attacked!

329
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:31,569
But it seems he got away empty handed

330
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:35,169
because Conan and I arrived!

331
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,069
It was probably just a thief or something.

332
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,969
It happened once before.

333
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,169
It happened before?

334
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,569
Why didn't you warn us?

335
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,269
I did.

336
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,969
Didn't I tell you to secure the storm shutters.

337
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,569
Besides, it's quite late

338
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:57,069
and look how you're dressed.

339
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:02,369
Your belly button's showing.

340
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,569
Besides, you don't even look good in that...

341
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:05,769
How dare you!

342
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,069
This is my favorite outfit!

343
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,669
Don't worry. You look good in anything.

344
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:14,069
Whether it's a yukata or a bathing suit.

345
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,769
What do you think you're doing?

346
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,169
I'm moving you into another room.

347
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,969
We have another room available.

348
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,669
But if you prefer to spend the night

349
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,469
in a room a stranger broke into,

350
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:28,669
that I'll be fine with me.

351
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:30,169
No...

352
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,669
And I suggest you forget about going out tonight,

353
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,769
have dinner in our dining room.

354
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,269
Your assailant may be waiting out there for you.

355
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,969
What do you think, Ran?

356
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,869
Let's have dinner here.

357
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,569
Hey, the food here is pretty good.

358
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,969
If we'd known before, we should've had dinner here last night.

359
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,469
If you had made reservations,

360
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:05,869
we could've prepared an even fancier seafood dinner for you.

361
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:09,769
Of course, this meal would be on the house.

362
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,069
But in exchange...

363
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,369
We'd appreciate you didn't go telling people that

364
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,569
a thief runs around our inn.

365
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:19,769
All right... I won't tell anyone!

366
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:23,369
That there's a knife wielding underwear thief in this place!

367
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:24,769
He had a knife?

368
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,069
What?

369
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,169
That's right!

370
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,069
Some might seeped in through the crack of the door

371
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,869
and I caught a glimpse of it.

372
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,469
The blade of the knife flashed!

373
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:39,169
Don't tell me it's the same guy who killed the girl they found in woods

374
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,269
near the railroad tracks this afternoon

375
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,769
and the girl with long brown hair was also found stabbed

376
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:49,969
in the abdomen here in Izu last year.

377
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:54,569
But if it is, why's he after Sonoko?

378
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,369
Because she has brown hair?

379
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,569
That's ridiculous!

380
00:19:58,569 --> 00:19:59,869
Wait a minute.

381
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,069
The guy who attacked Sonoko

382
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:05,069
was going through the luggage!

383
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,769
What could have been in those bags

384
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:11,169
that had anything to do with the murder?

385
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,569
A camera!

386
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:16,969
Could there be a picture in it of the crime?

387
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:18,269
Sonoko!

388
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,769
Did the man who attacked you take your camera?

389
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,269
It was still in my bag!

390
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,369
But the back of the camera was open.

391
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:27,369
Then did he get the film?

392
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,669
It wasn't there in the first place!

393
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,969
I took all 36 shots,

394
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,769
so this afternoon I brought it to be developed

395
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,369
so I could look at them during dinner tonight.

396
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,269
See! They've been developed!

397
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:41,569
Well then. May I have a look?

398
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,269
-Go ahead. -Wait a minute!

399
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,669
Don't worry!

400
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,369
I took your pictures out. It's with me.

401
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:52,669
Sonoko, you sneak! You made me scared!

402
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,569
Do you know these people?

403
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,669
You sure took a lot of pictures of couples.

404
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,769
She took those before she met you.

405
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,369
She was in a very foul mood.

406
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:04,869
She took those while making fun of them!

407
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,569
Ran...

408
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,069
That's strange.

409
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,269
Nothing looks out of the ordinary

410
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,669
and the victim's not in any of them either.

411
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,169
Besides...

412
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:19,769
Although we passed the spot where it happened last night,

413
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,569
Sonoko didn't take any pictures there.

414
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,469
So why did the killer think she took a picture that night

415
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:31,169
that would incriminate him?

416
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,569
I don't understand.

417
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:41,069
Something she said at the beach concession bothers me though.

418
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:42,769
With his deductive powers,

419
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,069
I'm sure he'll be able to figure out who it is in a snap.

420
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:50,869
"House of Sea" -If the killer was at the concession then,

421
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:51,869
But...

422
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,969
would that consent make him misunderstand?

423
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:56,369
Hey, ladies.

424
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,769
You said you were leaving tomorrow afternoon, didn't you?

425
00:21:58,769 --> 00:21:59,969
Yes.

426
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:03,569
Then, shall we go to that haunted restaurant in the daytime?

427
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,069
-What? -Yes. Let's go!

428
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:07,469
It's not scary in the daytime!

429
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:09,269
All right, but no camera!

430
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,069
Yes, I know!

431
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:19,269
It might be my imagination but it feels like somebody is watching us.

432
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,369
And the guy in the glasses

433
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:24,869
that Ran says she saw somewhere bothers me too.

434
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,569
Then there's the man who attacked Sonoko.

435
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:32,869
Was he really just some small-time thief?

436
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:08,369
"Next Episode"

437
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,169
The side brake is disengaged!

438
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,769
Sonoko, wake up! Sonoko!

439
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,069
It's that guy again!

440
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,969
Oh, no! Sonoko is in danger!

441
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,369
Next Conan,

442
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:33,390
"Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story (Part 2)"

443
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:36,171
Next Conan Hint:

444
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,271
"Bite mark"

445
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:40,471
-In next episode... -Sonoko finally found a boyfriend!

446
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,471
-I'm so happy! -Just being happy isn't enough.
