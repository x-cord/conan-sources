1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,690
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,470
Conan's logic works great on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,520
Today's case is Shinigami
Jinnai and his devious crime!

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,430
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,010
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,970
His name?

7
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,879
The Shinigami Jinnai Murder Case.

8
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:49,059
I am coming for the foul Kuroda Kenzo.
-Shinigami Jinnai

9
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,959
Wicked lawyer Kuroda Kenzo!

10
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,919
I'm here to send you to Hell!

11
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,389
Help!

12
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,599
It's time!

13
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:31,189
Shinigami Jinnai- A New Challenge

14
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:42,989
Does he usually fall asleep
in the first five minutes?!

15
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,449
Really, now!

16
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,919
We were lucky to see an early
screening and you fall asleep!

17
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,849
I couldn't help it!
I was up all night working!

18
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,379
You mean drinking!

19
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,279
But the movie wasn't that great.

20
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,299
Really? I liked it...

21
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:05,469
Well, I guess this
series is getting stale...

22
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,269
It's Shinigami Jinnai's actor,
Nanjo Hayato!

23
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,979
Nanjo Hayato (42)- Movie Actor

24
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,449
Excuse me...

25
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,779
Aren't you the famous
Mori Kogoro-san?

26
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,969
Yes, I'm Mori Kogoro,
the great detective!

27
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:31,379
I'm Nanjo Hayato's wife.
Nanjo Miyuki (37)- Nanjo's Wife

28
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,799
Nice to meet you!
That was a great movie!

29
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,169
Gimme a break...

30
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,389
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about...

31
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,519
Right in here, Detective Mori.

32
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,229
This is quite a nice office!

33
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,139
No, we couldn't find anywhere new...

34
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:55,879
Here you are.

35
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,719
Satomi-san.

36
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,699
This is Mori Kogoro-san,
the famous detective.

37
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:00,759
Yoshino Satomi (28)- Nanjo's Manager

38
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,849
I'm Nanjo Hayato's manager,
Yoshino Satomi (28)- Nanjo's Manager

39
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:03,949
Yoshino Satomi.
Yoshino Satomi (28)- Nanjo's Manager

40
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:06,659
Satomi-san. Show it to him...

41
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,009
But, ma'am!

42
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,909
Just show it to him.

43
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,929
Alright...

44
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,039
What the...

45
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:22,339
- "I am coming for Nanjo Hayato tonight.
- Shinigami Jinnai"

46
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,799
A warning from Shinigami Jinnai?!

47
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,729
It was in the office mailbox this morning.

48
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,759
Did you take it to the police?

49
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,929
No...

50
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:32,229
There's no need.

51
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,689
It's obviously a prank!

52
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,899
But, Honey!

53
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,179
I told you not to do anything!

54
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,859
Sorry, but I must ask you to leave.

55
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:46,829
But, Nanjo-san! Your wife
is this worried about you...

56
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:53,059
Even if the letter is real,
I'll protect myself!

57
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,539
But, still!

58
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,309
Anyway, I'm busy! Get out!

59
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,379
Yoshino-kun.
You can leave for today, too.

60
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,719
Behind me is the
office of Nanjo Hayato,

61
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:14,679
who has received a death
threat from Shinigami Jinnai.

62
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,259
It's just past 9:00.

63
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,399
Will Shinigami Jinnai
appear as warned?

64
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,059
The famous Mori Kogoro-san
is also present,

65
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,869
so the tension is high!

66
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:32,869
Hello. I'm the great Mori Kogoro.

67
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:35,419
What're you doing?

68
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:39,249
OK, we're done! Take a short break!

69
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:43,679
Everything will be all right.

70
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:49,179
The culprit can't make a
move as long as we're here!

71
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:50,809
Now, now, Mori-san.

72
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,189
There's no need to get excited;

73
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,889
Ohno Tadao (45)- TV Director
There's no need to get excited;

74
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,229
he's not gonna show.
Ohno Tadao (45)- TV Director

75
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,099
What do you mean?

76
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,439
It's obvious that Nanjo did
this just to promote the movie!

77
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,649
How dare you say that?!

78
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:06,949
Please, calm down, ma'am!

79
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,059
I'll go buy something to drink!

80
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:11,199
Let's go, Conan-kun!

81
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:21,639
Huh? Isn't that Satomi-san,
his manager?

82
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,379
You're right! I guess
she didn't go home yet...

83
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,479
What do you think she's doing?

84
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,059
She could watch the office from there!

85
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,099
She's probably worried too!

86
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,889
Let's go, Conan-kun!

87
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,009
So Nanjo-san's the
only one here this late...

88
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,979
Hey, where's Ohno-san?

89
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,459
He went to the bathroom...

90
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,949
What do we do next?

91
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,509
I'll go look for him...

92
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:53,479
What is it?

93
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,719
Over there!

94
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:00,629
Shinigami Jinnai!

95
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,959
Hey! Get the camera!

96
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,379
Give yourself up!

97
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,559
Damn! I lost him!

98
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,519
Nanjo-san's in danger!

99
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,519
Crap!

100
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,029
Satomi-san! Why are you here?!

101
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,469
I was in that burger shop
when I saw Shinigami Jinnai

102
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,739
run inside the building!

103
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,349
What?!

104
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,869
Dammit!

105
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:40,789
No you don't, Conan-kun!

106
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:41,789
But...

107
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,639
Conan-kun! Was that--

108
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,099
The culprit's still on the 7th floor!
I just saw his shadow!

109
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,059
Alright!

110
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,539
Damn, what's this tape for?!

111
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,559
Vinyl tape?

112
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,599
So the killer disappeared
from the scene, Mori-kun?

113
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
Yeah, Inspector.

114
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,389
The windows are all
locked from the inside,

115
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:51,509
and the elevator and the stairs
are the only way off the 7th floor.

116
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:55,989
But he was gone when we rushed in.

117
00:08:55,989 --> 00:09:00,039
And you're certain
that nobody left the building?

118
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:04,749
Yes, we and the reporters
were out front the whole time...

119
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:07,169
But what about the emergency stairs?

120
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,339
Inspector.

121
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,559
The emergency stairs here meet
up with the 1st-floor elevator

122
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,759
and lead to the same exit.

123
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,229
I watched the emergency stairs,
but nobody used them.

124
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:27,149
So the killer just
disappeared like smoke...

125
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,059
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

126
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,509
Doesn't it seem strange?

127
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,639
We saw the killer standing at
the window when the lights came on.

128
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,869
But the light switch is by the door.

129
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,109
How exactly did he turn the lights on?

130
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,709
That is strange...

131
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:53,639
Why did the killer turn the lights
on after murdering Nanjo-san?

132
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,669
And--

133
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,719
Why on earth did the killer
leave this vinyl tape behind?

134
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,059
Most likely so we would
trip and get tangled up in it,

135
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,889
allowing him to make his getaway.

136
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,729
But you're the only
one who tripped on it!

137
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:20,329
Nanjo-sama, please look over the article.
An article check request...

138
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:24,389
10:03 pm. Just before
he was murdered...

139
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,719
Just about the time Shinigami
Jinnai appeared in the park...

140
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,789
But isn't this--

141
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:29,789
Alright, you!

142
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,249
Don't touch that!

143
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,679
That's an interview that's being
published in a magazine next week.

144
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,179
Nanjo-san was waiting
for it to arrive tonight.

145
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,559
Let go of me!

146
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,599
Inspector! This shady
character was lurking about!

147
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:48,849
How rude! I'm no shady character!

148
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,309
Ohno-san! Where have you been?!

149
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,059
I returned from the bathroom
to find everyone gone,

150
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,109
so I was looking around the park!

151
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:59,239
So it was you
who killed my husband!

152
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:01,389
What are you talking about?!

153
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:06,709
Come to think of it, you're
the only one without an alibi!

154
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,009
You were still bitter about
the accident three years ago...

155
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,169
...so you killed him!

156
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,769
That's insane!

157
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,469
What is she referring to?

158
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:21,929
I work on an entertainment show now,

159
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,219
but I was once a movie director.

160
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:31,219
Until the accident three years ago during
the filming of Shinigami Jinnai...

161
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:36,569
The designated stuntman
never showed up that day...

162
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,029
We have no choice.
We'll do it without him.

163
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:42,469
I dunno, Nanjo. It's too dangerous!

164
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,989
You can handle it, right, Kitano?

165
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:45,009
Kitano Hiroyuki (28)- Movie Actor

166
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,179
Up-and-coming actors need
Kitano Hiroyuki (28)- Movie Actor

167
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,719
to be able to do this much.
Kitano Hiroyuki (28)- Movie Actor

168
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,309
Yeah...
Kitano Hiroyuki (28)- Movie Actor

169
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,259
Yeah...

170
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:51,959
Director! I'll do it!

171
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,469
But...

172
00:11:54,469 --> 00:12:02,719
Kitano-kun had agreed, so filming
began upon Nanjo's insistence.

173
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:06,559
The car flipped over and exploded.

174
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,809
Kitano-kun was killed.

175
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:15,439
I took full responsibility
and gave up the director's chair.

176
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,469
I did resent Nanjo.

177
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:24,279
But there's someone who resented
him much more right there!

178
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,889
After all, she was Kitano-kun's lover!

179
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,409
Is this true?!

180
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,219
Yes. Kitano Hiroyuki was my lover.

181
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:40,919
I worked for the same agency
as a 2nd-rate action movie actress.

182
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:47,469
Yes, it was a terrible accident!
But I don't blame Nanjo-san for it!

183
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:53,849
Satomi-san was out front with
us when Nanjo-san was killed!

184
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:00,899
Oh yeah! I caught Shinigami
Jinnai on tape in the park!

185
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,239
What?! So that should show--

186
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,099
There's a VCR on the 6th floor!

187
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,469
I'll go set it up!

188
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,809
Come to think of it, why did
the killer show himself in the park?

189
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:17,139
The same with the window locks--
there must be some reason!

190
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,999
It came from downstairs!

191
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,009
Come on!

192
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,009
The stairs are faster!

193
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,889
Shinigami Jinnai just--

194
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,179
What?!

195
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:49,801
And when you got off the elevator,
the emergency exit was open.

196
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:57,031
Then Shinigami Jinnai came
out of the office, fired, and ran off?

197
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,741
Yes...

198
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:03,171
That's odd. It's exactly one
hour since Nanjo-san was killed.

199
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:08,211
Did he hide in the building and
avoid police detection the whole time?

200
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,591
And why did he shoot, anyway?

201
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,511
Satomi-san was alone.
Running off would've been far safer

202
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:17,511
than firing and attracting attention!

203
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:18,221
Inspector.

204
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:21,551
We finished examining
the murder scene.

205
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,671
Good work. Did you find the bullet?

206
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:29,271
No. It probably flew outside
through the emergency exit.

207
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:33,241
In which case,
finding it will be difficult.

208
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:36,701
Inspector. The video's all set.

209
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,881
Let's have a look.

210
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,671
Why's this one by itself?

211
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:49,131
It's still warm.

212
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:52,091
And it's not rewound!

213
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,841
Could it be?!

214
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:57,301
You shouldn't touch
other people's things.

215
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:59,511
I'm sorry!

216
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:07,011
Aha! I've figured out
the killer's trick!

217
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,011
But I need more proof!

218
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,071
That's it! That fax!

219
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,951
Hey, Conan! Where're you going?

220
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,801
Just as I thought!

221
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,421
No question about it!
That person is the killer!

222
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,831
Hey! Conan! Quit running around!

223
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:28,131
Look at this!

224
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:33,341
Huh? This is just that fax...

225
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,551
What's so big about it?

226
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:39,671
Hello?

227
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,011
Right.

228
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,461
Inspector.

229
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:43,781
It's Mori-san.

230
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:44,811
Thanks...

231
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,801
Hello? Mori-kun?

232
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:49,771
What?! You solved the mystery?!

233
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:53,051
Yes. The killer didn't disappear.

234
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,491
He was never there in the first place!

235
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,511
What?! What does that mean?

236
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:05,051
It means Nanjo-san was already
dead when we got to the building.

237
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:09,591
But Conan-kun and the others
saw the killer in the window!

238
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:12,781
That was a trick the killer set up.

239
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:13,881
Trick?!

240
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:19,221
I'll demonstrate it for you.
Have everyone come back upstairs.

241
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:23,211
Please bring some vinyl
tape and fishing line as well.

242
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,511
Vinyl tape and fishing line?

243
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,521
It seems everyone's here, so I'll begin.

244
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:33,341
First, after murdering Nanjo-san,

245
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:36,011
the killer cut the lights
and placed the vinyl tape

246
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:40,491
on the window in a zigzag manner
to create the shape of a person.

247
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,961
Next, he affixed the
fishing line to the area

248
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:52,551
between the elevator
and the outer door.

249
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:59,381
He then wrapped the line around
the light switch in the office,

250
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:03,801
and tied the end to
the tape roll on the window.

251
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:09,731
All that remained was for
someone to call the elevator down...

252
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:21,361
The light made it look
like someone was in the room.

253
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,551
The tape came undone
when the line was pulled,

254
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:27,291
making it look like
the person was crouching.

255
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:32,551
When pulled far enough, the tape
roll caught on the elevator,

256
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,091
and then the line snapped,
leaving the roll behind.

257
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:39,551
But what about the gunshot?

258
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:44,011
That was a cassette tape recording.

259
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,511
A cassette tape?

260
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:49,931
Yes. The killer shot Nanjo-san
with a silencer-equipped gun,

261
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:54,761
set up the elevator trick,
took the stairs to the 6th floor,

262
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:58,901
and put a tape with a
gunshot on it in the stereo.

263
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:04,491
There'd be no way to make
certain the gunshot was heard below...

264
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:09,091
The killer added fifteen minutes of
silence to the start of the tape

265
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:14,091
and used that time to appear
in the park as Shinigami Jinnai

266
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:17,011
and lure us to the building.

267
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:24,011
The killer then met up and heard
the gunshot with us to create an alibi.

268
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,931
Hold on a second!
Does that mean the killer is--

269
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:31,711
Yes! The only one capable
of pulling off this trick...

270
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,481
...was you, Yoshino Satomi-san!

271
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,691
But what was the second gunshot for?

272
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:41,801
The second gunshot
wasn't meant to happen.

273
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:47,661
Yoshino-san didn't realize the
stereo was set on auto-rewind.

274
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:55,541
As it was a 60-minute tape, the same
gunshot rang out one hour later!

275
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,921
When you went
downstairs to set up the VCR,

276
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,091
you probably recovered the fishing line!

277
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:04,341
Then the gunshot suddenly played!

278
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:12,051
Surprised, you quickly hid
the tape and came up with a lie.

279
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,731
There's no proof!

280
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,171
But there is.

281
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:19,191
Inspector. Have a look at the faxes.

282
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,111
Alright...

283
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:25,281
One of the pages
should have bloodstains on it.

284
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:30,551
That fax came in just as
the murder was taking place.

285
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:31,741
Here it is!

286
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:35,551
In other words, the time
on the page with bloodstains

287
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,211
is the real time
Nanjo-san was murdered.

288
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:41,171
9:59 pm.

289
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:45,011
We heard the gunshot at around 10:15.

290
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:49,261
That makes it fifteen minutes before then.

291
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:56,231
There should be a gunshot
on that tape you took from Conan.

292
00:19:56,231 --> 00:20:00,131
Plus, Shinigami Jinnai
could move so nimbly in the park

293
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:04,341
because you used to
be an action movie actress.

294
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:09,091
You're right. I killed Nanjo-san.

295
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:13,451
To get revenge on him for
killing Hiroyuki three years ago!

296
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,911
But that was an accident...

297
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,551
I thought so too at first!

298
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,011
But then I found Hiroyuki's diary.

299
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,591
The week before the accident,

300
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:28,881
there was talk of him replacing
Nanjo as Shinigami Jinnai!

301
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:35,351
I joined Nanjo's agency as a manager
to learn the truth about his death!

302
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:41,131
And then a month ago,
Nanjo got drunk and divulged everything!

303
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:47,091
Hey, Yoshino. Remember
that kid who died three years ago

304
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:49,281
during the filming of Shinigami Jinnai?

305
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:53,991
Yes. Didn't he get in an accident
while doing his own stunt?

306
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,051
Accident, huh...

307
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,011
Accident, indeed...

308
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:01,011
Here's something interesting.

309
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:07,011
I lied to the stuntman
so he wouldn't come that day.

310
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:12,681
The kid was a beginner but
thought he could steal my role!

311
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,601
You know what this is?

312
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,761
No. What is it?

313
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,561
My good luck charm.

314
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,271
A bolt that keeps a
car's front wheels in place.

315
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:27,981
What?! That means--

316
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:32,301
That's right! He didn't wait
for an accident to happen!

317
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,701
He killed Hiroyuki himself!

318
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,751
I wrote the letter to
use the media as an alibi.

319
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:45,131
When I advised using it to promote
the movie, Nanjo readily agreed.

320
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,421
The rest was as you said.

321
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,671
Shinigami Jinnai versus
Detective Mori Kogoro.

322
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:31,361
Looks like Shinigami
Jinnai lost completely.

323
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:34,381
Of course he did!

324
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:37,821
The word "unsolvable"
isn't in Mori Kogoro's dictionary!

325
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:41,841
And who do you
have to thank for that?

326
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:47,091
Darn it! We'll just
have to bust it down!

327
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,971
Eh?!
Eh?!

328
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:56,681
None of their things came out positive?!
None of their things came out positive?!

329
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:03,181
The one behind this manipulated
the victim in this empty office

330
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:04,531
and poisoned him!

331
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:07,651
As if by magic!

332
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,681
On the next Conan--

333
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,891
The Finance Company President Murder Case.

334
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:16,794
Next Conan's hint:

335
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,194
Toilet.
