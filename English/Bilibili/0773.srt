1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,640
Before I became Conan Edogawa,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,140
I was brought to Beika Aquarium by Ran

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,940
in order to carry out a project entitled

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,940
"The great coincidental two lovers meet again

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,340
at the aquarium lovey-dovey project",

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,740
in an attempt to bring an end to the separation of her parents.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,940
But, there...

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,140
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,040
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,940
Cell phone movies at the underwater spiral corridor.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,940
A queer subject relays the truth.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,540
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:30,835
"Shinichi Kudo Aquarium Incident (Part 2)"

16
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:31,635
"Beika Aquarium"

17
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:33,735
"Beika Aquarium" -I panicked!

18
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,535
"Kanoko Nakagiri (27), Customer" -I was picked up by him

19
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:38,235
"Kanoko Nakagiri (27), Customer" -only last week.

20
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:42,035
I smelled something fishy.

21
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:45,735
I thought it best not to get involved.

22
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,935
Wearing a mini skirt, smelling of perfume

23
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,435
and about 5'4".

24
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:51,835
See?

25
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:56,335
Then, you're the one who came to this aquarium with the victim?

26
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,435
Yes.

27
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:59,435
When I told him I liked dolphins

28
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:02,235
he invited me to come to this aquarium with him.

29
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,035
Then, you saw the dolphin show too, didn't you?

30
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:08,235
Yes! Together with him.

31
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,535
But, after he left for the restroom,

32
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,935
he didn't come back.

33
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:15,035
The dolphin show finished.

34
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:18,135
So I went looking around for him thinking to give it to him,

35
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:20,135
but was I shocked out of my wits!

36
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,035
Because he was collapsed on the floor bleeding.

37
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,535
What shocked me even more was after that...

38
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:30,635
The call that came in on his cell phone.

39
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,235
The people around him seem to have been making a fuss

40
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:35,335
saying that there was a stabbing incident

41
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:37,335
so I decided to ignore it.

42
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,835
I thought that maybe the one who called

43
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:44,835
was the one who stabbed him and was coming after me too.

44
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,435
Why did you think they'd come after you?

45
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,935
Because he was talking sneakily on his cell phone

46
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,835
about things that sounded dangerous.

47
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:55,535
Like, I'll get the dough ready for sure or whatever.

48
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,135
Could it be that you're suspecting me if so, you're wrong.

49
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:01,835
I have movie to prove it too, you know!

50
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:04,735
The one that I took at the dolphin show a while ago.

51
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,735
The viewers in front are drenched!

52
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,535
This is funny.

53
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:15,935
The show ended at 12 pm sharp!

54
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:21,135
-His corpse was found before 12, right? -Yes.

55
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,035
I was recording the dolphin show to the end

56
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,535
and the voice that's recorded is mine too!

57
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:29,135
This will serve as an alibi, no?

58
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:31,535
True.

59
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:36,835
The victim was Mr. Shumoto?

60
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:40,035
What is your relationship with the victim?

61
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:42,035
"Naho Ojiro (26), Customer" -He was my ex-boyfriend.

62
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,335
It's already been a year since we split, though.

63
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:48,535
Then, why did you ignore his call?

64
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:52,335
Because he kept bugging me to reconcile time and again so...

65
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,835
I was dating today too.

66
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:58,135
That's why I had my cell phone switched off.

67
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:59,235
Then...

68
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:03,035
you were with your date right through?

69
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,335
Yes.

70
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,735
This is him.

71
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:10,135
You can ask him if you need to.

72
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:13,735
But, testimonies of lovers don't...

73
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:14,735
Come to think of it.

74
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,235
Just about the time the incident occurred,

75
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:20,035
I was taking a movie.

76
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,535
Really?

77
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:28,235
It's been about 10 minutes already

78
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:30,235
but nothing's happening.

79
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:32,535
It's after this...

80
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:35,635
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

81
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,035
-We're in the movie. -Quick!

82
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,835
-No joke. -Shinichi.

83
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:39,935
What was that?

84
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,635
This is his voice.

85
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,735
Something seems to have happened.

86
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:48,335
Do you want to go look?

87
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,535
No, no. I don't want to get involved.

88
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:55,435
This indeed seems to be a movie that you took.

89
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:59,135
And why was Mr. Shumoto here?

90
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:03,135
It seems he was on a date with his girlfriend.

91
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:07,235
Then, maybe he just called

92
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:09,435
because he wanted to introduce her to me.

93
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,935
"Beika Aquarium"

94
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:15,335
You must be the one going with Ms. Naho Ojiro?

95
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:18,735
Yes. How do you know?

96
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:21,235
She just told me a while ago.

97
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,335
She also told me that the one who was killed here today

98
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:25,935
used to be her ex-boyfriend.

99
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:26,935
What?

100
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,735
"Kohdai Jinbei (28), Customer" -Naho's ex-boyfriend was killed?

101
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,135
Really?

102
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:35,335
You know him too, don't you?

103
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:38,935
No way. It's a first.

104
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:43,435
But, your mail address was also in his cell phone

105
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,435
and you ignored the text mail that I sent you a while ago too, didn't you?

106
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:48,235
Yeah, you mean the mail that said,

107
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:50,535
"Contact me right away?"

108
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:54,535
Since it was the same as the crank mail that I got before,

109
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,135
I deleted it.

110
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:58,335
I get a lot of those recently.

111
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,535
"If you want to hear my secret, click here."

112
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:03,535
It were sexually provoking mails.

113
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:07,135
Was the sender Naho's ex-boyfriend?

114
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,235
Yes.

115
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:10,535
By the way, at the time of the crime,

116
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:14,535
it seems you were also taking movies like she was.

117
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,835
Yeah.

118
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,935
Maybe...

119
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,635
You mean this?

120
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:25,935
Ran, go back to the entrance and get the staff for me!

121
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,835
Quick!

122
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:30,535
What was that?

123
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,235
Something seems to have happened.

124
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:34,335
Do you want to go look?

125
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:36,635
No, no. I don't want to get involved.

126
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:38,335
Right.

127
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:43,935
Of course even before this, the movie was taken without interruption.

128
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:48,035
Because we were both planning to upload the movie on the blog later.

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,535
Inspector Megure.

130
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:54,135
There were other viewers who filmed the dolphin show,

131
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,735
so we checked them against what Ms. Nakagiri took

132
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,635
and found there were no discrepancies.

133
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,435
I see.

134
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:05,635
Why of all places did the perpetrator choose that tunnel

135
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,635
as a place to commit the crime?

136
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:10,135
If it were the corridor where the normal fish tanks are lined out,

137
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,135
it's dark so the other people

138
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:14,435
can only make out the silhouette of the perpetrator.

139
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:17,735
Why did the perpetrator deliberately choose such a bright tunnel?

140
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:23,035
Ran, lend me your cell phone.

141
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,435
I forgot to bring mine.

142
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:26,835
Okay.

143
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,235
Don't break it.

144
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:31,035
Because I finally got Dad to buy it for me.

145
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:34,235
Sorry, but will you please look the other way?

146
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,435
Hey, what's with you? What?

147
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,335
Just what are you up to?

148
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:40,535
What do you mean what?

149
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,135
I'm wondering if that tunnel holds any meaning...

150
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:44,335
Well, of course.

151
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,735
Because no matter where you look

152
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,635
there's nothing more but all kinds of fishes,

153
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:50,935
and it's as if you're at the bottom of sea!

154
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:53,935
Like I said...

155
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:57,035
It's romantic like a dating spot...

156
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:59,435
Shinichi?

157
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,035
I see.

158
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,135
That's why the perpetrator chose that place.

159
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,935
He chose this place because he wanted to replicate the ocean,

160
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,435
and this place is exactly that!

161
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,535
Hey, just what do you mean?

162
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:16,435
All the others have gone home,

163
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:19,535
and yet why are we the only ones here?

164
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,035
I showed it to you, didn't I?

165
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:22,535
The movie to prove my alibi.

166
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,935
You saw mine too, didn't you?

167
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,635
Mine too.

168
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:29,735
Yes, we did see it.

169
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,035
There's just one person that took a queer movie.

170
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,235
A movie that practically confesses

171
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,935
that the person is a murderer.

172
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:46,035
I hope you're not going to say that it's the dolphin show that I took?

173
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,435
The movie you took was terrible.

174
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,035
The images were blurred

175
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,035
and the voices were cracked,

176
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:54,935
that it wasn't worth watching.

177
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,935
I couldn't help it. Because I...

178
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:59,135
Right.

179
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,935
It's only natural

180
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,635
because you're an amateur.

181
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,435
On the contrary,

182
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:08,235
the movie that Mr. Jinbe took was fantastic!

183
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:09,835
He had taken a great shot of the shark

184
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,735
that was swimming gracefully.

185
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:15,335
Am I going to end up being the perpetrator because of it?

186
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:20,035
No, you're probably just used to taking movies.

187
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:24,335
You wanted to upload the movie onto your blog too.

188
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,235
The movie in question is...

189
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,935
the one that your girlfriend,

190
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,835
Naho Ojiro took!

191
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,803
This is that movie.

192
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:52,803
This was taken by Mr. Jinbe

193
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,103
and the one on this side was taken by Ms. Ojiro.

194
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:58,203
Don't you notice anything?

195
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,303
What do you mean?

196
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:01,603
Mine is taken sideways

197
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,503
and hers is taken vertically.

198
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:10,503
Yes. Normally, if you want to film a fish that is long sideways,

199
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,303
you would take it sideways, like Mr. Jimbei, wouldn't you?

200
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:16,903
In order to get the entire body into the frame.

201
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:20,603
However, Ms. Ojiro took the movie vertically.

202
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:23,303
Just as expected, the shark that was in her movie,

203
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:26,403
framed out in no time at all.

204
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:32,503
I wasn't interested in taking the shark.

205
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:35,603
That's not the only thing that's strange.

206
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:39,303
When somebody is taking pictures of something,

207
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:45,003
it's common sense to try to avoid interrupting the cameraman.

208
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:47,503
Like in this movie taken by Mr. Jinbe

209
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:50,503
But, in Ms. Ojiro's movie,

210
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:52,503
nobody seems to give a care,

211
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,803
and they are interrupting left and right.

212
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,303
It's almost as if they're not aware

213
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:01,303
that she's even taking a picture.

214
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,803
That's because...

215
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,403
It's only natural that they're not aware

216
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:08,803
because she had her cell phone...

217
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,603
inside his knitted cap, here,

218
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,603
while taking the movie!

219
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,703
Even if a white cell phone were to be stuck into a white knitted cap,

220
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:23,503
unless you take a good look, it's quite inconspicuous.

221
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:28,503
Placed this way, she gets to take movies as if she were behind him.

222
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:33,403
That's why she chose the tunnel of this fish tank!

223
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,703
The front and back are full of fish,

224
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:37,203
no matter what the shot,

225
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:40,503
there is some kind of fish in the frame of the camera.

226
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,903
But, if he had something like that in his cap,

227
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:44,203
you'd think he'd notice, right?

228
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:48,403
She probably said there's something on your cap

229
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,303
and made him take it off once,

230
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,903
buried the cell phone into the knitted cap,

231
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:53,203
then put it back on him again.

232
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:58,403
You can remove the cell phone in the wink of an eye.

233
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,803
There was a part in her movie that was blurred, wasn't there?

234
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,803
That's when she removed it.

235
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:07,503
But people tend to move their faces unconsciously,

236
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:10,003
so I wonder if it's possible for someone to take something so fixed.

237
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:12,303
That can be explained.

238
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:13,503
Because he...

239
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:20,203
He hurt his neck and head neck braces on,

240
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:24,303
so his head was more or less set in place.

241
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,703
How do you know about my braces?

242
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:29,503
When I called out to you from the side,

243
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:33,603
you turned your body and all towards me.

244
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:34,903
And even when watching the movie,

245
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:38,903
you brought the cell phone right up in front of your face.

246
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,803
That's why I thought that you hurt your neck

247
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:43,503
and couldn't look down.

248
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,803
Which means that while she was letting him take the movie,

249
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,703
Ms. Ojiro went to commit the crime.

250
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,603
Yes. She had it set to see the victim at this tunnel,

251
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:56,403
and after rendering him unconscious with a stun gun,

252
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,903
she went on to pierce his heart with a knife and stab him to death.

253
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,203
Then, she went back to Mr. Jinbe

254
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:04,403
to retrieve the cell phone.

255
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,603
But, it's a miracle nobody saw her.

256
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:11,203
She was probably dressed so that it wouldn't hurt being witnessed.

257
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,303
If she removes her jacket and lifts her skirt up,

258
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:14,703
then wear a cap or something,

259
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:16,503
she'd look like a different person.

260
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,303
Once she gets out of the bright tunnel,

261
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:19,803
that rest is practically all dark.

262
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:23,803
This way, changing clothes wouldn't be a problem.

263
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:25,903
But however, it's too bad...

264
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:29,103
there was just one thing you couldn't change.

265
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,703
Yes. It's this glove.

266
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:35,903
It's reversible

267
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:39,303
so it seems that you're wearing it inside out to hide the fact...

268
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:45,803
See, just as I thought,

269
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,803
the blood of the victim is on the fingertips of your right hand.

270
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:51,803
How'd you know?

271
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,803
The picture you took with him that you showed me.

272
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,903
Judging from what you're wearing, I know you took it today.

273
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,003
But, the color of your gloves were different.

274
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:04,203
People normally don't bring two different gloves with them.

275
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:08,603
Besides, that picture is what you took using your right hand.

276
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:12,303
You handed the Inspector your cell phone with your right hand.

277
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,003
You are apparently right-handed

278
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:17,603
But, after taking off your glove,

279
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,903
you worked your cell phone with your left hand.

280
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,403
Putting all these together,

281
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:25,903
with the fact that a bit of blood

282
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:29,703
was on the inside of the bag of the convenience store,

283
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:32,003
that the perpetrator used to stab the victim.

284
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:35,703
Simple summing up leads me to my conclusion.

285
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:38,203
Let's have forensics check the blood then.

286
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,703
If you're going to check, I'd like you to do it fast.

287
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,403
I'm dying to wash the blood of that guy off of me

288
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,403
as soon as I possibly can you see.

289
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:50,403
So, you killed him after all, Naho?

290
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:52,903
Yes, I did.

291
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:55,803
He threatened to distribute indecent pictures of me

292
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:57,903
over the net because I dumped him.

293
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:05,103
That guy said that he sent several to your cell phone too.

294
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:08,903
So, that's where that indecent text mail came from...

295
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,903
Right.

296
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:15,003
If you opened it you would've found an indecent picture of me.

297
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:18,103
It seems though, that you deleted it without opening it.

298
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,803
How'd he get my mail address?

299
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:24,403
When I went over to his house to tell him that I wanted to split.

300
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:27,803
That guy when I went to the restroom,

301
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:31,003
seems to have looked through my cell phone.

302
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,003
He told me, "If you don't want me sending your indecent pictures

303
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:37,003
to your boyfriend, work place and family, pay me.

304
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:40,003
I'm up to my neck with debt."

305
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:46,603
That's why I decided to distribute his blood instead.

306
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,603
But, I goofed.

307
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:54,803
If I didn't turn my glove inside out because I got blood on it,

308
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:57,603
I may have been able to get away with it.

309
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:58,603
No.

310
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:03,403
It was obvious even if you didn't turn your gloves inside out.

311
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:06,803
In the movie that Mr. Jinbe took,

312
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:09,903
you wore gloves on both hands.

313
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,003
You used your left hand to work the cell phone

314
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:15,503
and back then your gloves were the knitted kind.

315
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:19,003
It's hard to work a smart phone unless your hands are bare

316
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:22,403
That just goes to show and serves as proof

317
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:26,803
that you needed gloves to do what you were trying to carry out.

318
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:29,403
It's a simple deduction.

319
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,203
I think that it's better to call the whole thing

320
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,003
about the lovey-dovey re-encounter project off,

321
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:39,703
because of this incident that happened here at this aquarium.

322
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,003
I guess so.

323
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:47,203
Oh, no. It's raining.

324
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:48,803
Let's run home then.

325
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:51,203
Hey, I told you not to run.

326
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,703
But, why?

327
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:56,503
My cell phone!

328
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,603
No.

329
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:02,603
Why was my cell phone in my hood?

330
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,103
Sorry.

331
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,903
I was thinking of where the perpetrator put the cell phone

332
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:07,903
to take the movie

333
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:11,103
and forgot that I hid it in your hood.

334
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,703
So, what are you going to do about it?

335
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,503
Dad just bought it for me.

336
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,103
Don't cry.

337
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:20,903
I'll buy you a new one someday.

338
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,503
You're the pits. Really!

339
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,103
Nothing good happens when I'm with you!

340
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:27,403
Even when I went to the States,

341
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,603
all I did was run into crimes.

342
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:32,303
Okay, then...

343
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:36,203
Tropical Land! I'll take you there!

344
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,203
Tropical Land?

345
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,303
What's with that happy sounding place?

346
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,103
I hear they're going to be making it in Tokyo.

347
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:48,903
I'm sure that no crimes can happen at an amusement park.

348
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:53,303
I don't mind going if you're treating me to everything.

349
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:57,103
Why don't we go and you treat me

350
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,103
if I win the Tokyo Karate Championship?

351
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,703
Hey, hold it.

352
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:03,203
You were the runner up last year

353
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:05,203
and didn't the Senior upper classman that won the championship

354
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:08,003
quit the club already?

355
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,703
You promised, okay!

356
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:15,903
I don't get much of an allowance.

357
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:18,603
And if you're getting me a cell phone,

358
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:20,103
make sure you get me the sea cucumber man

359
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:22,903
that they sell at the Beika Aquarium too.

360
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:24,903
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,603
I was half joking

362
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:53,803
and yet he really went out and bought it for me.

363
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:59,003
But, I wonder how he really felt about me back then.

364
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,703
I wonder if he...

365
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:03,903
Oh, no.

366
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,603
"Heart pounding" -I'm getting this unstoppable urge to want to ask him.

367
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,603
Shinichi's cell phone?

368
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,803
"Incoming call, Ran Mouri"

369
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,803
From Ran?

370
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,803
Shinichi?

371
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:20,903
Ran.

372
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:24,103
Where do you think I am now?

373
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:27,303
I'm at the Beika Aquarium where I came with you before.

374
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,803
Yeah. That place where the stabbing took place.

375
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:33,503
By the way,

376
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:36,203
I have something I want to ask you about.

377
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:38,903
Back then, did you... you know, Shinichi..

378
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:41,503
What did you think of...

379
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,503
Oh, you mean that?

380
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,603
When I told you not to run, right?

381
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:49,003
That's not it?

382
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:52,803
Oh, yes. Well, that too but...

383
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:56,103
Right, that was sort of bugging me too.

384
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:57,303
Back the you said

385
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,603
that all you were doing was checking the mail from your mother

386
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:02,203
and didn't respond to Sonoko's mail, right?

387
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:04,903
Moreover, you were using your left-hand then.

388
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:08,003
You probably hurt your right hand,

389
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:11,703
so you couldn't do something complex as to respond to a mail.

390
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:14,003
Since you didn't take off your glove,

391
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,703
you must've had a bandage on your hand.

392
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,003
But, since you were all excited saying

393
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,203
that you were going to win the championship,

394
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:24,103
you probably just sprained your finger or something.

395
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:27,203
Right, I got hurt during karate practice.

396
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:29,803
But, what does that have to do with telling me not to run?

397
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:33,603
It's because with a finger like that you could never...

398
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,703
hook on your bra.

399
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:43,203
After all, you only have the kind that have hooks in the back.

400
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:48,303
How do you know something like that?

401
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:51,503
My seat was right behind yours,

402
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,103
so each time you bent forward,

403
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:54,603
I couldn't help but see it.

404
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,403
I can't picture you asking that goofy detective,

405
00:22:57,403 --> 00:23:00,603
Dad of yours to hook it on.

406
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,403
Sonoko had a cold.

407
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:03,903
And it's hard to believe you would go all the way to your Mom

408
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:06,803
just to ask her to do it for you.

409
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:10,103
In other words, you weren't wearing a bra back then...

410
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:11,903
You may not know it,

411
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:14,803
but if you run without a bra, your boobs will sway to no end

412
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,503
and the Cooper's ligaments that support your breasts will stretch

413
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:20,103
causing your breast to start sagging.

414
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:21,403
Idiot!

415
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:24,203
I use them, the ones called sports bras!

416
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,503
Oh, right!

417
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:30,103
I forgot that she used them at the school club activity.

418
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:32,803
And when it comes to the bras with hooks behind,

419
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:35,003
all I have to do is hook it up after bringing it in front like this

420
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:38,603
and spin it around like this.

421
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:41,503
Just what do you think you're making me say, stupid!

422
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:44,903
I hung up.

423
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:49,903
So, what did she call me for anyway?

424
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:52,503
"Next Episode"

425
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:53,803
This is "Anxiety."

426
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,603
What is the meaning of this?

427
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,503
The car that was in front of us with the "Scream" in it,

428
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:02,003
suddenly went off route and disappeared!

429
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:05,803
It's like a three-panel cartoon.

430
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:09,703
It's about the "Scream" drawn by Munch being stolen, right?

431
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:11,703
How do you know?

432
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:14,003
This was a crime!

433
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:17,103
Next Conan,

434
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:21,303
"Munch's Scream Disappears"

435
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:39,303
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,403
"Car navigation"

437
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:42,603
Pretty sunflower!

438
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:43,603
How selfish.

439
00:24:43,603 --> 00:24:44,603
The next time's at the theater.

440
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:46,103
Prepare to have it out, great detective!
