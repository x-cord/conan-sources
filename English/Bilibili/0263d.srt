1
00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:05.745
You know, Heiji.

2
00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:07.645
You keep talking about a killer,

3
00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:10.145
but this doesn't look like anything else except suicide.

4
00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:11.545
All right, take a look at this.

5
00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:13.845
Look on Ms. Katagiri's right side.

6
00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.045
It's faint because it's wet, but you can still see it.

7
00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.845
There are 2 or 3 strange marks.

8
00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:21.545
You're right! There is strange marks here.

9
00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.045
And there're all the same.

10
00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:25.745
Isn't that blood?

11
00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:27.845
Yes, probably from the victim.

12
00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:29.345
From the victim?

13
00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:33.045
That's right. Ms. Katagiri died from a blow to the head,

14
00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.045
but she didn't get it when she fell

15
00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.645
and hit her head on the bridge girder.

16
00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.845
Someone might have hit her on the head with something hard.

17
00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:44.945
Causing blood to splatter onto the killer

18
00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:48.545
and the blood got on her when the killer picked her up.

19
00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:50.545
What I'm saying is

20
00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:53.045
when Kazuha and Ran saw her on the bridge,

21
00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:54.745
she was already dead.

22
00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:56.745
Another thing. The figure you saw

23
00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:58.345
suddenly burst into flames and fell into the moat,

24
00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:00.045
that's why you came to the wrong conclusion

25
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:02.145
and assumed it was a suicide.

26
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.345
But when she burst into flames,

27
00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:06.745
it looked like she was struggling in pain.

28
00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:10.345
Yes, that's right. She was definitely alive.

29
00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.045
That's what you thought you saw.

30
00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.045
It was very dark, you didn't get a good look, did you?

31
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.345
Yes, but...

32
00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:19.545
Well anyway, those guys seem suspicious to me.

33
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.045
I've got to find those three guys who were on the same tour

34
00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.645
as the two deceased people and question them.

35
00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:27.545
Are you talking about us?

36
00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.345
We came back right away just like you told us to

37
00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:30.745
and noticed the big commotion.

38
00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:34.045
It looks like the crowd's getting bigger.

39
00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.045
What happened here?

40
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.745
What? I don't believe it!

41
00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:43.145
Ms. Katagiri fell from the bridge while burning up?

42
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.145
From this Gokuraku Bridge?

43
00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:46.145
Yes.

44
00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:48.445
But why would she commit suicide by setting herself on fire?

45
00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:51.445
It hasn't been officially declared a suicide yet.

46
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.245
That's why we need you to answer few questions.

47
00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:56.245
First off, you fellows and Ms. Katagiri left this area,

48
00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:57.545
where did you go

49
00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:01.245
and what were you doing before coming back.

50
00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:04.745
I went to get something to eat at a small restaurant near here.

51
00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:06.245
I did the same.

52
00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:08.545
Only I went to a different restaurant.

53
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.645
I went back to the hotel in Nanayari

54
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:15.045
where we're all staying and changed my clothes.

55
00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:17.845
So you were with Ms. Katagiri, weren't you?

56
00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:20.545
Yes, until we got back to the hotel.

57
00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:22.045
If I'd known something like would happen,

58
00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:24.045
I should have stayed with her the whole time.

59
00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:28.045
But why did Mr. Kato and Ms. Katagiri choose fire?

60
00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.845
It's almost as if someone ordered them to do.

61
00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:33.345
Ordered?

62
00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:37.245
That reminds me, Mr. Wakisaka.

63
00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:41.745
You were playing the role of Nobunaga, weren't you?

64
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.145
Yes.

65
00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:45.645
That means, if you ordered them to do something,

66
00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:47.845
they'd have to obey, wouldn't they?

67
00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:48.845
Well, in that case,

68
00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:51.545
Fukushima who could assume Nobunaga's role for 3 minutes

69
00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:53.545
-could also have done it, too. -What?

70
00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:57.845
I played Ieyasu, so that leaves me out of the picture.

71
00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:01.145
So one of you must have done it.

72
00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:04.445
Their duty was to entertain Nobunaga,

73
00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:06.445
not to take orders!

74
00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:08.445
Besides, no one would obey an order

75
00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:10.645
to set themselves on fire.

76
00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:13.345
And another thing. Ms. Katagiri played Nene,

77
00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:15.345
that was just a supervisory role.

78
00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:18.645
Also, when the first member of our party died,

79
00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.245
we wouldn't be so callous as to continue our role playing game!

80
00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:24.645
Yes, I see what you mean.

81
00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:26.045
Inspector Otaki.

82
00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:30.045
We've found another piece of pottery on Ms. Katagiri's body.

83
00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:31.945
What, again?

84
00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:36.945
I wonder why they all had pieces of pottery like this.

85
00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.945
And we found this photo, too.

86
00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:43.745
The young couple in the right corner...

87
00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:46.145
Isn't that Mr. Kato and Ms. Katagiri?

88
00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:51.245
You're right. So they knew each other from before.

89
00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:54.445
But who are the other three people?

90
00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.745
Oh, that's Hirano.

91
00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:00.645
Here, that's him.

92
00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:01.745
You're right.

93
00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:04.145
He looks really young, but I think that it's him.

94
00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.745
And who's this Hirano character?

95
00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:09.445
He planned this tour.

96
00:04:09.445 --> 00:04:13.745
We got all together because of Hirano's home page.

97
00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.845
He suggested we all go on a trip.

98
00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:21.045
He came up with the idea of the role playing game, too.

99
00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:22.945
Unfortunately, just before we were leaving on the trip,

100
00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.745
something important came up and he couldn't make it.

101
00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:27.245
I see.

102
00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:29.145
So the man planned this trip

103
00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:32.645
resulting in strange deaths, isn't in attendance?

104
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:35.845
Are you absolutely sure Ms. Katagiri didn't commit suicide?

105
00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:39.245
Yes. Well, we can't say for sure just yet.

106
00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:44.345
Well, if the killer is using this tour to commit murders,

107
00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:47.245
the first thing we should do is talk to Mr. Hirano.

108
00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:49.645
All you have to do is

109
00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:53.145
access "Legend of the Lord of Gold" home page.

110
00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:00.445
-That's him. -Huh?

111
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:03.445
When Ms. Katagiri burned and fell from the bridge,

112
00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:07.045
that's who the suspicious person behind Ran and Kazuha was.

113
00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:09.545
Yes, I thought so too,

114
00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:11.545
but there's something I don't understand.

115
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:15.145
The killer called Ms. Katagiri out to the bridge, killed her

116
00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:17.745
then tied a rope around her and propped her against the railing

117
00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:19.545
and waited in the distance for someone to come by

118
00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:21.945
when the moment was right, the killer pulled the rope

119
00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:24.745
and she fell into the moat, that set up is easy.

120
00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:26.845
But to set her on fire at just the right time

121
00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:29.545
make it look like she was writhing in pain as she fell,

122
00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:31.645
that's not as easy thing to do.

123
00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:33.445
Another thing bothers me, too.

124
00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:37.545
That strange blood stain on her side.

125
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:41.245
I'm pretty sure that's from blood that was on a zipper.

126
00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:46.645
But none of those three wore clothes with a zipper.

127
00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:47.945
There has to be a reason the killer would

128
00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:49.845
go to the trouble of changing into that kind of outfit

129
00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:53.445
then calling Ms. Katagiri out to the bridge.

130
00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:05.345
I know what it is.

131
00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:06.345
Yeah.

132
00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:09.745
Now we know why the killer wore a special outfit that has a zipper.

133
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:14.145
The question now is, who used that trick.

134
00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:18.645
Well, anyone of those three could have.

135
00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.645
Hey, Heiji. Let's go already.

136
00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:23.245
It's getting windier, too!

137
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:26.945
My umbrella!

138
00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:36.045
Hey, Hattori.

139
00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:37.945
I think we...

140
00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:40.645
I think we made a big mistake.

141
00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:48.545
Oh, my umbrella's ruined.

142
00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:51.745
Well, you can always buy a cheap one from that store nearby.

143
00:06:53.945 --> 00:06:56.345
Huh? Where's Heiji?

144
00:06:56.345 --> 00:06:58.445
He took Conan and went off somewhere.

145
00:06:58.445 --> 00:07:00.045
They probably figured out who the killer is.

146
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.345
Huh?

147
00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:05.545
He was positively glowing.

148
00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:16.545
Gosh. They couldn't have gone so far,

149
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:18.045
but I don't see them.

150
00:07:18.045 --> 00:07:21.045
It's no use! Only one of them is at the hotel.

151
00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:23.445
The other two haven't returned yet.

152
00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:26.845
There might be another murder.

153
00:07:26.845 --> 00:07:30.045
After the first and second cases are investigated thoroughly,

154
00:07:30.045 --> 00:07:34.445
the trick is bound to be exposed.

155
00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:37.745
So the killer's got to finish the job by tonight.

156
00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:40.145
Where could they have gone?

157
00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:43.645
Over there! That's Mr. Kasuya!

158
00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:47.445
It doesn't look like he's heading back to the hotel.

159
00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:51.445
It looks like he's going to finish things.

160
00:07:51.445 --> 00:07:53.645
Okay! I'll let the police know.

161
00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:56.545
Stop. If the police come,

162
00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:59.445
there's bound to be a commotion and he might get away.

163
00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.245
Let's you and me open this one up on our own.

164
00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.645
I'm talking about the door to the truth.

165
00:08:08.245 --> 00:08:09.545
Wait, Hattori!

166
00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:36.845
That old man went into a suspicious looking warehouse.

167
00:08:36.845 --> 00:08:39.445
Hattori, don't you feel something?

168
00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:41.945
I get this weird feeling we're being watched.

169
00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:47.145
Hey, what're you doing? We're going in!

170
00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:48.745
Okay.

171
00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:01.045
It's so dark here, I can't see a thing.

172
00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:03.145
He's over there.

173
00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:05.245
It looks like he's going up.

174
00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.945
Kudo, that tranquilizer you've got in your watch,

175
00:09:07.945 --> 00:09:10.545
-get it ready. -Yeah, I know.

176
00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:16.245
Hey, Kudo. What's wrong?

177
00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.945
You need to go to the toilet?

178
00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:23.245
Oh, no. I'm going to lose sight of him if I don't get moving.

179
00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:25.145
Listen, Kudo. When you finish using the toilet,

180
00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:27.245
catch up with me right away.

181
00:09:38.908 --> 00:09:43.008
Hattori is giving us a tour of Osaka Castle

182
00:09:43.008 --> 00:09:44.408
when we meet up with a strange tour group

183
00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:46.508
who are fans of Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

184
00:09:48.608 --> 00:09:50.408
One of their members,

185
00:09:50.408 --> 00:09:52.908
Mr. Kato burst into flames on the roof of the tower and fell off.

186
00:09:55.608 --> 00:09:57.708
Written on the scroll he had on him

187
00:09:57.708 --> 00:10:00.108
was the word "dragon" and the drawing of a gourd.

188
00:10:00.108 --> 00:10:02.608
They indicated where the treasure of Hideyoshi,

189
00:10:02.608 --> 00:10:04.108
the so called Lord of Gold, was hidden.

190
00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:10.908
And before Mr. Kato's death was ruled a suicide or murder,

191
00:10:10.908 --> 00:10:12.708
another death occurs

192
00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:15.808
right in front of Ran and Kazuha.

193
00:10:15.808 --> 00:10:18.508
Ms. Katagiri died after setting herself on fire

194
00:10:18.508 --> 00:10:20.308
and falling off the Gokuraku Bridge.

195
00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:28.708
Hattori and I noticed the strange blood stain on her clothes

196
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:31.108
and realized that this was a murder.

197
00:10:32.308 --> 00:10:34.308
Later, we followed Mr. Kasuya

198
00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:36.408
into a suspicious looking warehouse.

199
00:10:38.908 --> 00:10:40.108
He's over there.

200
00:10:40.108 --> 00:10:42.208
It looks like he's going up.

201
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.908
Kudo, that tranquilizer you've got in your watch,

202
00:10:44.908 --> 00:10:47.908
-get it ready. -Yeah, I know.

203
00:10:51.408 --> 00:10:53.308
Hey, Kudo. What's wrong?

204
00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:54.908
You need to go to the toilet?

205
00:10:56.408 --> 00:11:00.208
Oh, no. I'm going to lose sight of him if I don't get moving.

206
00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:02.108
Listen, Kudo. When you finish using the toilet,

207
00:11:02.108 --> 00:11:04.108
catch up with me right away.

208
00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:30.008
Hey, sorry to make you wait.

209
00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:31.208
Wakisaka.

210
00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:33.008
No problem.

211
00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:35.108
Did you bring it with you?

212
00:11:35.108 --> 00:11:38.308
It's over there. Inside that box.

213
00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:40.408
I see, good!

214
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.308
But there's so much stuff in here

215
00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:46.408
and it's so dark, I can't make anything out.

216
00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:49.408
I put a flashlight on the side of the box.

217
00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:51.708
Why don't you use it?

218
00:11:52.308 --> 00:11:53.808
Here it is!

219
00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:58.008
Use that and you'll be able to find what you're looking for.

220
00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.808
The tiger scroll.

221
00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:01.408
I wouldn't turn it on if I were you.

222
00:12:03.108 --> 00:12:06.108
You'll be burnt to a crisp if you do.

223
00:12:07.008 --> 00:12:12.008
Just like Mr. Kato on Osaka Castle's tower.

224
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:15.008
Isn't that right, Mr. Wakisaka?

225
00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:20.208
You mean both Ms. Katagiri and Mr. Kato were...

226
00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:24.908
That's right. Mr. Wakisaka killed them.

227
00:12:24.908 --> 00:12:28.308
He used the same trick he used on you.

228
00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:29.508
He lured the three of you out

229
00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:32.408
by saying that he'd found the tiger scroll.

230
00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:34.908
It was easy with Mr. Kato.

231
00:12:34.908 --> 00:12:37.508
All he had to do was tell him that

232
00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:41.408
he hid the scroll under one of the tiles on the roof of the tower.

233
00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:42.708
in order to climb out on the roof,

234
00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:44.608
you'd avoid going in the afternoon

235
00:12:44.608 --> 00:12:47.008
when a lot of people would be around and wait until night.

236
00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:49.908
Going out there at night is fine, but without a light,

237
00:12:49.908 --> 00:12:52.108
you wouldn't be able to tell which tile it was under.

238
00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:54.608
Mr. Kato had no other choice,

239
00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:55.808
so he took the lighter he had out

240
00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:58.208
and lit it so he could look around.

241
00:12:58.208 --> 00:13:03.008
He saw a flashlight just lying there as if waiting to be found.

242
00:13:03.008 --> 00:13:05.808
Mr. Wakisaka had left it there earlier.

243
00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:12.508
It was rigged to explode when it was switched on.

244
00:13:12.508 --> 00:13:14.308
I see.

245
00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:16.508
So you're saying Mr. Kato chose to use the flashlight

246
00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.408
which was handier,

247
00:13:18.408 --> 00:13:22.008
but when he turned it on, it exploded.

248
00:13:22.008 --> 00:13:23.108
That's right.

249
00:13:23.108 --> 00:13:26.208
The flashlight exploded into tiny pieces

250
00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:30.208
and the lighter with his fingerprints on was left on the roof,

251
00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:33.708
making it look like he set himself on fire.

252
00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:37.608
That would explain the dry mark

253
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.608
that was left under the lighter.

254
00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:42.708
You wouldn't get that kind of mark

255
00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:44.508
unless you put a lighter on a round shaped mark.

256
00:13:44.508 --> 00:13:46.508
Besides, we found a burnt battery

257
00:13:46.508 --> 00:13:48.708
on the ground near the castle.

258
00:13:50.008 --> 00:13:53.008
But how did he kill Ms. Katagiri?

259
00:13:54.308 --> 00:13:56.708
According to the girls who witnessed it,

260
00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:59.708
when she set herself on fire,

261
00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:02.508
there was no one else around.

262
00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.408
And she was writhing in pain,

263
00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.708
as she fell into the moat.

264
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:10.308
And all she had in her hand as a lighter.

265
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.208
Suicide is the only conclusion.

266
00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:16.208
I don't blame you for thinking like that.

267
00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:18.808
But it wasn't her that set herself on fire

268
00:14:18.808 --> 00:14:20.108
and fell into the moat.

269
00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:24.708
It was Mr. Wakisaka.

270
00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:27.008
What?

271
00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:30.308
After the crowd that was gathered near the tower left

272
00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:35.008
and people walking around thinned out around the bridge,

273
00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:38.708
he called her out after making her change into a coat.

274
00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:42.908
Then he killed her by striking her with a hard object,

275
00:14:42.908 --> 00:14:45.908
then he threw her into the moat.

276
00:14:45.908 --> 00:14:48.408
Her body floated on the water

277
00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:51.708
and he poured kerosene on her, setting the stage.

278
00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:54.008
All he had to do was wait for someone to pass the bridge

279
00:14:54.008 --> 00:14:56.408
then set fire to his coat,

280
00:14:56.408 --> 00:14:57.608
and pretend to writhe in pain

281
00:14:57.608 --> 00:14:59.408
dropping the lighter into the moat,

282
00:14:59.408 --> 00:15:02.608
the lighter would set fire to Ms. Katagiri's body floating in the moat.

283
00:15:02.608 --> 00:15:04.208
After that, he jumped into the moat

284
00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:06.208
and dove underwater.

285
00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:09.108
The only thing visible would be

286
00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:13.708
Ms. Katagiri's body burning in the water.

287
00:15:15.008 --> 00:15:16.708
What you're saying is, even when her body

288
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.808
was lifted out of the water and examined,

289
00:15:19.808 --> 00:15:22.208
the injury on her head which was the actual cause of her death,

290
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.408
would appear to have been a result of her hitting her head on the girder

291
00:15:24.408 --> 00:15:26.408
because the witnesses would testify

292
00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:31.908
that she set fire to herself and fell from the bridge.

293
00:15:31.908 --> 00:15:32.908
That's right.

294
00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:34.808
But it only went as smoothly as it did

295
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:38.208
because those girls happened to pass by at just the right moment.

296
00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.408
If a lot of time had passed before anyone had walked by,

297
00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:43.808
the time of death would be off, wouldn't it?

298
00:15:43.808 --> 00:15:44.808
Not really.

299
00:15:44.808 --> 00:15:48.408
Because Mr. Wakisaka had already prepared a witness.

300
00:15:48.408 --> 00:15:49.808
It was mere coincidence

301
00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:51.708
that Kazuha and Ran saw what happened first,

302
00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:55.208
it appears the intended witness ran away from the scene though.

303
00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:58.608
Don't tell me that it was...

304
00:15:58.608 --> 00:16:00.708
It was Mr. Fukushima.

305
00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:03.308
He didn't know anything about the incident,

306
00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:06.608
but when he heard a burning body fell into the moat,

307
00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:09.308
he immediately said it was suicide.

308
00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:10.908
Think about it.

309
00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:12.008
If someone were going to commit suicide

310
00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:13.508
by setting themselves on fire,

311
00:16:13.508 --> 00:16:16.708
they wouldn't jump into water. It would put the fire out.

312
00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:19.808
It would be natural to assume that you'd jump into the water

313
00:16:19.808 --> 00:16:22.508
only if someone else set fire to you, isn't that right?

314
00:16:22.508 --> 00:16:24.908
What he said proves that he witnessed her

315
00:16:24.908 --> 00:16:27.308
jumping into the moat after setting herself on fire.

316
00:16:27.308 --> 00:16:29.008
Judging by the events of the day,

317
00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:30.608
all a person would have to do is disguise their voice

318
00:16:30.608 --> 00:16:32.508
pretending to be the police and call him out to the bridge,

319
00:16:32.508 --> 00:16:35.608
he would have gone there right away.

320
00:16:35.608 --> 00:16:38.008
But it's awfully strange.

321
00:16:38.008 --> 00:16:39.408
After what happened,

322
00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:42.008
Mr. Wakisaka's hair and clothes weren't all that wet.

323
00:16:42.008 --> 00:16:43.108
And if by chance something went wrong,

324
00:16:43.108 --> 00:16:44.408
he could have been seriously burned.

325
00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:48.708
He was wearing a dry suit

326
00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:51.308
under his coat over his clothes.

327
00:16:52.808 --> 00:16:54.508
If he wear to put the hood on before setting fire to himself,

328
00:16:54.508 --> 00:16:56.408
he wouldn't get burned,

329
00:16:56.408 --> 00:16:58.508
and neither his hair or his clothes would get wet

330
00:16:58.508 --> 00:17:00.708
so he could swim underwater.

331
00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:01.808
Until he got far away from the bridge

332
00:17:01.808 --> 00:17:03.808
then climb up the stone wall,

333
00:17:03.808 --> 00:17:06.908
and after he hid the dry suit and coat somewhere,

334
00:17:06.908 --> 00:17:08.408
he went and joined the crowd

335
00:17:08.408 --> 00:17:10.708
so as not to draw suspicion to himself.

336
00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:14.208
Incidentally, both the flammable fleece Mr. Kato wore,

337
00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:19.008
and Ms. Katagiri's coat were given to them by you, right?

338
00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:22.108
You probably told them that it would be easy for them

339
00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.408
to spot each other when they snuck off to meet in secret.

340
00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:28.008
Did you know there was blood on Ms. Katagiri's coat?

341
00:17:28.008 --> 00:17:30.008
Her blood splattered on your clothes

342
00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:32.108
and then you got it on her.

343
00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:35.508
It got on her when you carried her.

344
00:17:36.408 --> 00:17:39.008
They were shaped like the zipper on a dry suit

345
00:17:39.008 --> 00:17:42.508
and the edge of that badge you have on your chest.

346
00:17:42.508 --> 00:17:43.508
Which means that

347
00:17:43.508 --> 00:17:47.008
if we were to check that Nobunaga badge you're wearing,

348
00:17:47.008 --> 00:17:50.108
we'll have the proof to nail you.

349
00:17:50.108 --> 00:17:52.908
But why did he want to kill me and the other two?

350
00:17:52.908 --> 00:17:55.108
You three weren't the only ones.

351
00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:58.808
He killed the man who planned this trip, Mr. Hirano too.

352
00:17:58.808 --> 00:18:03.308
I asked a professor I know to access Mr. Hirano's home page,

353
00:18:03.308 --> 00:18:05.908
he found that Mr. Hirano had been putting new entries on a daily basis

354
00:18:05.908 --> 00:18:08.208
but he stopped 3 weeks ago.

355
00:18:08.808 --> 00:18:11.808
Remember that burnt body they found in the outer moat recently?

356
00:18:11.808 --> 00:18:13.608
That was probably...

357
00:18:13.608 --> 00:18:15.608
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:18:15.608 --> 00:18:20.208
I killed Hirano, Kato and Katagiri

359
00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:23.108
in dedication to my grandfather Masakiyo

360
00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:26.108
who loved Hideyoshi and was killed for it.

361
00:18:26.108 --> 00:18:28.208
Your grandfather?

362
00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:30.708
You saw the picture, didn't you?

363
00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:33.108
The old man in the middle holding the scroll open

364
00:18:33.108 --> 00:18:35.208
was my grandfather.

365
00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:38.408
He always used to tell me

366
00:18:38.408 --> 00:18:40.908
about the scroll he'd found

367
00:18:40.908 --> 00:18:43.908
and about the clues to Hideyoshi's treasure.

368
00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:46.708
He told me he wanted to give up looking for the treasure

369
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:50.708
and donate the scroll to the country.

370
00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:52.908
But the others didn't agree

371
00:18:52.908 --> 00:18:55.508
and they began to argue about it.

372
00:18:55.508 --> 00:18:59.708
Then 13 years ago, he told us he was going to Osaka

373
00:18:59.708 --> 00:19:01.908
to try and convince the others to agree with him,

374
00:19:01.908 --> 00:19:04.308
and he never came back.

375
00:19:04.308 --> 00:19:09.208
You mean the burnt body they found in the moat 13 years ago...

376
00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:12.508
Was my grandfather. He was killed by his partners.

377
00:19:12.508 --> 00:19:16.608
Grandfather found that piece of pottery along with the scroll

378
00:19:16.608 --> 00:19:19.408
but he didn't tell the others about it.

379
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.508
That photo was the only clue I had

380
00:19:21.508 --> 00:19:24.208
as to who his partners were,

381
00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:26.508
so I had a hard time finding them.

382
00:19:26.508 --> 00:19:28.708
And I never imagined that one of them

383
00:19:28.708 --> 00:19:31.108
would change how they looked.

384
00:19:32.308 --> 00:19:36.608
You mean that old man on the left is...

385
00:19:40.108 --> 00:19:41.308
That's me.

386
00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:44.908
Something happened, and I had to change my appearance.

387
00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:46.908
Ms. Katagiri seemed to suspect

388
00:19:46.908 --> 00:19:50.208
that I was a member of their former group.

389
00:19:54.008 --> 00:19:55.308
I don't care what happens to me,

390
00:19:55.308 --> 00:19:57.908
but are you going to kill Mr. Wakisaka too?

391
00:19:57.908 --> 00:20:01.008
You'll never find out where the treasure is.

392
00:20:01.008 --> 00:20:05.608
I assume you haven't brought the tiger scroll with you.

393
00:20:05.608 --> 00:20:08.308
I've already found out where Mr. Wakisaka lives

394
00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:10.608
I'll just tear his house apart.

395
00:20:10.608 --> 00:20:13.108
Both of you move to the back, quickly!

396
00:20:13.108 --> 00:20:16.208
Pick up that flashlight and turn it on.

397
00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:18.608
I'm going to have you two fall to the ground.

398
00:20:18.608 --> 00:20:21.208
It's going to look like the killer and the teenage detective

399
00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:24.408
fell to their deaths while engulfed in flames.

400
00:20:24.408 --> 00:20:28.108
By the way, before you die, answer my question.

401
00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:31.608
How did you figure out Mr. Wakisaka was the killer?

402
00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:35.608
Anyone could have used that trick you just explained.

403
00:20:35.608 --> 00:20:38.008
What tipped you off?

404
00:20:38.908 --> 00:20:40.508
Why should I tell you?

405
00:20:40.508 --> 00:20:42.408
It was the umbrella.

406
00:20:44.708 --> 00:20:48.108
In Mr. Kato's last moment, he grabbed hold of an umbrella,

407
00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:50.208
it was his dying message.

408
00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:53.808
He was indicating Nobunaga's standard, the golden umbrella.

409
00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:59.008
That's how he knew Mr. Wakisaka was the killer.

410
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.408
You little brat! When'd you get up there?

411
00:21:01.408 --> 00:21:03.108
Get down here!

412
00:21:03.108 --> 00:21:06.208
Or I'll fill your friend here with holes!

413
00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:07.608
No! Don't come down there!

414
00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:09.608
I guess I don't have a choice.

415
00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:11.008
You idiot!

416
00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:13.208
What a good little boy.

417
00:21:18.308 --> 00:21:20.608
You're Heizo Hattori!

418
00:21:22.008 --> 00:21:23.708
Dad?

419
00:21:23.708 --> 00:21:26.808
You may have changed how you looked 13 years ago

420
00:21:26.808 --> 00:21:28.208
but it seems like you can't change

421
00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:31.008
that sick voice or that warped personality.

422
00:21:35.408 --> 00:21:38.508
You're under arrest for possession of an illegal weapon

423
00:21:38.508 --> 00:21:40.908
and for attempted murder!

424
00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:45.008
Also for the five robbery murders you committed

425
00:21:45.008 --> 00:21:48.008
because you failed to find the treasure.

426
00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:50.408
You're going to pay for what you did!

427
00:21:50.408 --> 00:21:52.308
Robbery murders?

428
00:21:52.308 --> 00:21:53.608
I don't know what you're talking about!

429
00:21:53.608 --> 00:21:55.908
No use pretending!

430
00:21:55.908 --> 00:21:58.708
We've get your voice on tape, on the spur of the moment,

431
00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:00.508
the victim recorded it on his answering machine,

432
00:22:00.508 --> 00:22:02.408
and we've also got your handprint on the telephone

433
00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:05.108
when you hung it up!

434
00:22:05.108 --> 00:22:07.708
There's no sympathy for those who turn against their friends.

435
00:22:07.708 --> 00:22:09.508
If you don't want to get hurt...

436
00:22:09.508 --> 00:22:12.008
Come along quiet like and let us put these cuffs on you!

437
00:22:24.508 --> 00:22:28.808
So the case that spanned 13 years

438
00:22:28.808 --> 00:22:33.408
was personally solved by the head of Osaka's prefectural police

439
00:22:33.408 --> 00:22:36.208
while we watched in wonder,

440
00:22:36.208 --> 00:22:38.908
it all happened in a blink of an eye.

441
00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:26.208
You must feel good about this.

442
00:24:26.208 --> 00:24:28.108
You sent each of us a piece of that pottery

443
00:24:28.108 --> 00:24:31.008
and baited us with all that talk of the tiger scroll,

444
00:24:31.008 --> 00:24:34.308
you knew that would make us join the tour.

445
00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:39.108
You succeeded in avenging your grandfather with one blow.

446
00:24:39.108 --> 00:24:40.108
And on top of that,

447
00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:44.708
your family's got Hideyoshi's treasure all to themselves.

448
00:24:45.808 --> 00:24:49.308
That was no treasure map.

449
00:24:49.308 --> 00:24:50.808
What do you mean?

450
00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:54.208
This is what was written on the tiger scroll.

451
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:55.908
"This is to certify that I have received

452
00:24:55.908 --> 00:24:58.908
the 1,000 items depicted on the dragon scroll.

453
00:24:58.908 --> 00:25:00.408
From Kajisuke."

454
00:25:00.408 --> 00:25:04.408
Kajisuke? Isn't he the thief who was after Hideyoshi's gold,

455
00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:07.708
the one who went down into the Kinmeisui well?

456
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:08.908
That's right.

457
00:25:08.908 --> 00:25:12.808
Kajisuke left that letter intending it be a joke.

458
00:25:12.808 --> 00:25:18.108
Then why didn't that grandfather of yours tell us?

459
00:25:18.108 --> 00:25:20.708
He couldn't.

460
00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:22.108
Not to his friends who were so excited

461
00:25:22.108 --> 00:25:24.408
about finding the treasure,

462
00:25:24.408 --> 00:25:28.908
especially not to you who had invested so much money in the project.

463
00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:34.608
That's ridiculous.

464
00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:50.108
What? We were bait?

465
00:25:50.108 --> 00:25:53.408
Yes. This is what your father said.

466
00:25:53.408 --> 00:25:55.308
Sorry, Conan.

467
00:25:55.308 --> 00:25:58.708
But his men are all pros, they can spot a cop a mile away.

468
00:25:58.708 --> 00:26:00.408
In order to solve this case as quickly as possible,

469
00:26:00.408 --> 00:26:04.408
I thought it'd be best just to have Heiji followed

470
00:26:04.408 --> 00:26:08.108
because he always takes chances.

471
00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:09.308
So now you know.

472
00:26:09.308 --> 00:26:11.208
So he hit me to get me mad

473
00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:14.208
because he knew I'd take the risks?

474
00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:15.308
Yeah.

475
00:26:15.308 --> 00:26:19.108
He said he knew a lot of Mr. Kasuya's accomplices were coming here.

476
00:26:19.108 --> 00:26:21.508
Because you need a lot of men

477
00:26:21.508 --> 00:26:23.308
to transport 1,000 golden gourds.

478
00:26:23.308 --> 00:26:25.508
But before I was got into trouble,

479
00:26:25.508 --> 00:26:27.108
Inspector Otaki, who was staking things out,

480
00:26:27.108 --> 00:26:29.208
took me into protective custody.

481
00:26:29.208 --> 00:26:32.008
Hold it a second! You said stake out,

482
00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:34.908
does that mean dad knew Mr. Wakisaka was the killer?

483
00:26:34.908 --> 00:26:37.808
Yeah. When he questioned the people on the scene

484
00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:39.108
and found out Mr. Kato had grabbed the umbrella,

485
00:26:39.108 --> 00:26:42.708
he had someone follow Mr. Wakisaka.

486
00:26:42.708 --> 00:26:45.908
That beady eyed sneak of a father.

487
00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:48.608
If he ever tries something like this again,

488
00:26:48.608 --> 00:26:50.108
I'm going to stick my finger in his ear

489
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.708
and rattle it around so he can't talk!

490
00:26:53.908 --> 00:26:55.308
Ouch!

491
00:26:55.308 --> 00:26:58.908
Shizu, can't you be do it a little gently?

492
00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:01.108
Don't complain.

493
00:27:01.108 --> 00:27:04.208
I'm paying you back for putting Heiji through so much.

494
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:09.052
"Next Episode" -The point is where and what you were doing

495

during the time the crime was committed.

496
00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:14.552
I don't remember anything.

497
00:27:14.552 --> 00:27:17.352
Do you remember him?

498
00:27:17.352 --> 00:27:19.552
I'm sure I've seen this guy.

499
00:27:19.552 --> 00:27:23.952
Kogoro Mouri is Attorney Kisaki's husband, isn't he?

500
00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:25.152
Yes.

501
00:27:25.152 --> 00:27:27.852
This is getting to be quite interesting.

502
00:27:27.852 --> 00:27:30.552
Wait a sec. If so...
