1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.966
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.966
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.266
The children are playing baseball and the ball flies into a house.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.766
Where objects are toppled upside down and a man is killed.

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.466
Something about his room is not right!

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.066
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.966
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.060
Sensei!

10
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.060
Yeah.

11
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.760
Hi, Editor Shimaki.

12
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.260
What do you mean, "Hi, Shimaki"?

13
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.460
And what is it you want?

14
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.560
Just what're you talking about, Sensei?

15
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.760
Just joking, I'm just joking.

16
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.560
Please, come on.

17
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.860
You want the manuscript, don't you?

18
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.860
Yes! Yes, Manda Sensei.

19
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.560
Please stop joking with me and give it to me,

20
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260
I'm really in a fix.

21
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.860
Yeah.

22
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.060
The printers are saying they can only wait for another two hours.

23
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.860
Yeah. Two hours is more than enough.

24
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.460
Two hours?

25
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.260
All I have left to do is to write the final plot,

26
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.760
then write the epilogue, so it's no big deal.

27
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.160
Really?

28
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.560
Yes, really. Please trust me.

29
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.060
You've know me for a long time, haven't you?

30
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.760
Hey, Nobel.

31
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.560
Please watch Sensei so that he doesn't run out on me!

32
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm counting on you!

33
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.760
If he tries to run away, you can go ahead and bite him.

34
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.560
Okay, I'll be waiting at that elevator hall.

35
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.060
So, let me know when you're done!

36
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.060
Okay.

37
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.460
I know.

38
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.760
"Result of the Tumble (Part 1)"

39
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.860
Yes, in another two hours.

40
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.960
Yes, he says it'll be finished.

41
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.960
Yes, Sensei himself is saying so, therefore, please...

42
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.560
I think he'll be done too.

43
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.760
Yes, please don't worry, I'll make sure he writes it.

44
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.860
Teitan Elementary School 1st grade Class B,

45
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.160
"Towel Prince" Genta Kojima, facing a no-hit no run.

46
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.860
Two-out and bases loaded! Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya is doing just great.

47
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.060
Here goes the first pitch.

48
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.060
I got him.

49
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.860
I did it.

50
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.760
We're counting on you, Edogawa.

51
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.060
What do you mean you're counting on me? Hey.

52
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.760
The ball! The ball!

53
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.060
All right!

54
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.860
You can count on me.

55
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.760
I won!

56
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.160
Conan's fantastic.

57
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.360
If this were soccer, yes.

58
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.660
Take the ball with your glove because this isn't soccer.

59
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.260
Conan, don't tell me you're making light of baseball?

60
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
He's right, Conan!

61
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.960
Play like you should, come on.

62
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.060
Sorry. Sorry.

63
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.460
I can't help it, can I?

64
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.760
It's just a habit from playing soccer

65
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.660
that legs respond faster than my hands.

66
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.860
Sensei?

67
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.160
I've been waiting for you. I was really looking forward to seeing you.

68
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.660
Manda Sensei.

69
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.360
What's with that outfit of yours?

70
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.260
Don't tell me you disguised yourself as a bellboy

71
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.660
and escaped from the hotel again?

72
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.060
You never learn, do you?

73
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.760
Yeah.

74
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.660
Because I was confined.

75
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.060
This is the fastest, easiest way to get free.

76
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.860
No one notices me this way.

77
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.560
Nobel is with you.

78
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.860
Nobel! Nobel!

79
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.660
Oh, that a boy.

80
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.560
It's me!

81
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.760
If neither of us, you or me aren't around,

82
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.760
he may go berserk and hurt himself badly.

83
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.960
Huh?

84
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.460
Never mind that,

85
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.260
is it ready? The manuscript.

86
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.060
Yes. I finished it six hours ago.

87
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.860
What? Six hours ago?

88
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.060
But when I called you from the hotel a while ago,

89
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.860
you said you needed a little more time, didn't you?

90
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.760
I was kind of enjoying your panicky voice that I lied to you.

91
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.060
Please don't be offended.

92
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.460
Hey, hey. Haramoto!

93
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.660
I mean, it's really no big deal, is it?

94
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.860
Because I'm going through quite a bit of stress

95
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.060
ghost writing for you too.

96
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.960
Of course, in return I will get paid a lot.

97
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.560
So, I don't really have any complaints.

98
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.560
Here you go!

99
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.860
Here's the manuscript!

100
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.660
I wrote a happy ending to it just like you wanted me to.

101
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.060
Thank you.

102
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.960
Did you tell them about me already?

103
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.760
After I hand this over to them, I'm going to meet the editor

104
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.660
to discuss about the next series at my place.

105
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.660
After all that's done, I'll bring the editor over here.

106
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.460
Really? Thank you.

107
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.060
I'm really happy.

108
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.560
Well, if you make your debut, it might be time for me to retire.

109
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.060
Don't worry about it.

110
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.860
I'll continue ghost writing for you.

111
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.360
What I'll be writing are detective stories that you don't write!

112
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.860
The writing style is also different!

113
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.460
Different writing style?

114
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.760
The fact is, it's almost done!

115
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.960
My debut story!

116
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.260
You can look through it if you like.

117
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
It's written in a style so different from yours.

118
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.660
But, with this, I get to join the circle of novelists.

119
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.160
If I become a selling novelist,

120
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.560
I'll get to collect a lot more different things.

121
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.060
Come to think of it, you're a collector, aren't you?

122
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.960
Yes. I've always liked collecting all kinds of things

123
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.160
since my childhood.

124
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.360
But, the thing I want most now is...

125
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.860
the prize awarded to new writers, the Akutayama Award.

126
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.960
You're one of the judges too, aren't you, Sensei?

127
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.860
So I'll be able to win the award, won't I?

128
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.860
Unless I get this award,

129
00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.160
I won't be able to collect other awards later on!

130
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.260
Oh, talking about collecting, I finally found the thing I was lacking!

131
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.660
Oh.

132
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.760
It really feels good after all to have the entire collection.

133
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.460
Well, I'm really happy for you!

134
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.060
"In the middle of writing, don't enter!"

135
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.960
Come on, Nobel, let's go home.

136
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.860
Nobel?

137
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.660
Nobel? Nobel?

138
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.660
Where are you, Nobel?

139
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.160
Come on out!

140
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:12.360
Nobel?

141
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.960
Where are you?

142
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.460
My, God.

143
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.960
Quick. Quick, to the hotel.

144
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.460
Sensei. Manda Sensei.

145
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.760
I've got to get back to the hotel quickly.

146
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.760
Sensei? Sensei?

147
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.060
My alibi won't work...

148
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.160
Sensei, Manda Sensei.

149
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.660
What shall I do?

150
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.060
Sensei? It's two hours already!

151
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.560
What shall I do?

152
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.360
Sensei.

153
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.560
Manda Sensei.

154
00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:01.069
Sensei, Manda Sensei.

155
00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:06.669
Huh?

156
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:09.769
Sensei?

157
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:11.869
Talk about noisy.

158
00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:15.169
I finished writing it a while ago, and I'm just checking it now!

159
00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:16.869
Oh, I see!

160
00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:18.069
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:22.269
I think it's quite a good piece myself, so rest assured.

162
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:23.369
Here you go.

163
00:12:23.369 --> 00:12:24.769
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:27.969
Thank you. Thank you for finishing!

165
00:12:27.969 --> 00:12:31.569
By the way, where's Nobel?

166
00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:34.069
He always comes to the door.

167
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:36.369
Where is he?

168
00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:41.969
Oh, he's in the carry bag asleep.

169
00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.169
In the carry bag?

170
00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:46.969
I guess so.

171
00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:50.669
I'll go back to the editor's room and check on the manuscript.

172
00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.169
Oh, then why don't you do it here in this room,

173
00:12:53.169 --> 00:12:57.069
and send the data to the printers from here?

174
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:58.969
Wouldn't that be faster?

175
00:12:58.969 --> 00:13:03.569
And while they're doing the printing, you can come to my house

176
00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:06.669
and we can talk over arrangements for the next series.

177
00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:09.569
Oh, no. Because the next series you'll be writing

178
00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:11.369
is still some time away so...

179
00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:14.469
I'm sure you'll like it.

180
00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:18.569
The next series is something I've never written on about yet.

181
00:13:20.869 --> 00:13:23.269
A mystery?

182
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:26.369
You who specialize in historical novels?

183
00:13:26.369 --> 00:13:28.669
Are you joking?

184
00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:31.069
No, I'm not joking. I'll bet I surprised you.

185
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:32.869
I've wanted to try writing a mystery novel at least once,

186
00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:35.069
from some time ago.

187
00:13:35.869 --> 00:13:37.969
I see.

188
00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:39.869
That's something to look forward to.

189
00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:42.869
I'd like to see it soon myself too.

190
00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:44.969
Yes, yes.

191
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:49.969
Sensei, please tell me more in detail about this.

192
00:13:49.969 --> 00:13:53.369
Well, I already decided on the character of the detective.

193
00:13:53.369 --> 00:13:56.369
I'll talk more about it when we get to my house.

194
00:13:56.369 --> 00:14:00.969
What? Don't keep me in suspense, and tell me about it.

195
00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:02.869
Well, well.

196
00:14:02.869 --> 00:14:06.269
Nobel sure is quiet, isn't he?

197
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:08.369
Is he okay?

198
00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:11.269
Yeah, I guess.

199
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:15.169
He was running around all afternoon, so I think he got tired.

200
00:14:15.169 --> 00:14:17.269
Don't worry.

201
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:18.769
I guess so.

202
00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:32.969
Wait here a while, will you?

203
00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:36.469
It's a little messy so I'll go clean up a bit.

204
00:14:36.469 --> 00:14:39.169
Oh, okay. I'll wait.

205
00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:44.969
Nobel!

206
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:48.369
Nobel! Nobel!

207
00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:54.069
Nobel!

208
00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:04.069
You're back, good boy.

209
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:08.869
Perfect.

210
00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:14.569
The perfect crime has been established.

211
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:16.969
Right, Nobel?

212
00:15:20.869 --> 00:15:22.169
What was that?

213
00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:30.469
What that sound just now?

214
00:15:30.469 --> 00:15:36.069
It seems as if the glass or something of the house opposite here cracked.

215
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.469
It seems like the ball of the children who were playing baseball

216
00:15:38.469 --> 00:15:40.669
hit the window and struck it.

217
00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:41.969
What?

218
00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:45.869
Gee.

219
00:15:45.869 --> 00:15:48.269
Genta, you really fly the ball too far.

220
00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:51.969
Well, I can't help it because it flew away.

221
00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:54.969
Tell the ball where to go then.

222
00:15:54.969 --> 00:16:00.069
But it's strange, no one is answering.

223
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:03.169
Maybe the ball hit the head of the owner of this house

224
00:16:03.169 --> 00:16:04.469
and he passed out or something?

225
00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:06.469
What?

226
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:08.069
Even if that were to be the case,

227
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:11.269
we have no way of knowing unless we go inside.

228
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:13.169
-My... -Huh?

229
00:16:15.369 --> 00:16:16.869
Hey, wait a moment.

230
00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:18.569
Haibara?

231
00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:21.869
It's open after all.

232
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:25.069
Excuse me!

233
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:27.769
But, it's more like we're intruding.

234
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:31.969
The room that the ball went inside is...

235
00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:34.169
Hey, Conan!

236
00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:36.269
Are you sure it's okay that we're stepping into the house like this?

237
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:39.469
Conan! We'll be caught for trespassing.

238
00:16:39.469 --> 00:16:41.369
Conan!

239
00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:43.269
Haibara!

240
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:47.369
Let's say we have no other choice. How's that?

241
00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:49.669
We're entering!

242
00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.269
Excuse me?

243
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:55.369
Is anybody home?

244
00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:57.569
Excuse me.

245
00:16:57.569 --> 00:17:00.269
We're not suspicious people.

246
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:03.669
Huh? Something about this room is strange.

247
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:06.869
Yes. Something sure feels strange.

248
00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.069
I wonder what it is.

249
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.569
Can't you tell just by looking?

250
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.269
Over there!

251
00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:17.869
The mini cars, dolls and books that are lined on the shelf

252
00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.269
are almost all toppled and upside down.

253
00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:21.769
Why?

254
00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:24.169
Don't tell me...

255
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:27.269
it's because my ball flew inside here?

256
00:17:28.869 --> 00:17:31.369
Maybe because of that,

257
00:17:31.369 --> 00:17:35.069
there was a warp in space and a supernatural phenomenon occurred.

258
00:17:36.069 --> 00:17:40.769
Mitsuhiko, something's not right and besides there is no warp.

259
00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:43.169
The ball that Genta hit...

260
00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:44.669
I'm not going to let you beat me.

261
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:49.069
Here goes Genta! Hit this ball if you can.

262
00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.269
No matter what kind of ball it is...

263
00:17:54.469 --> 00:17:56.269
-Edogawa! -Conan!

264
00:17:56.269 --> 00:17:58.269
Huh? What?

265
00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:01.369
Oh no! This is a big one!

266
00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:05.169
Genta really hit the ball hard.

267
00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:21.569
The ball just coincidentally happened to go through

268
00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:23.669
the open window of this house, so...

269
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:26.169
But the sound of something cracking was heard, right?

270
00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:28.969
Maybe the ball hit a flower vase or something that was in the room

271
00:18:28.969 --> 00:18:30.969
-and cracked it. -What?

272
00:18:30.969 --> 00:18:33.269
You really think so?

273
00:18:33.269 --> 00:18:36.369
What shall I do if I hit something super expensive?

274
00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:40.769
I used up all the allowance I got for New Year's too.

275
00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:43.269
Well, the price and all of the object that was hit,

276
00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:46.469
we have no choice but to ask the person who lives here, right?

277
00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:47.469
"In the middle of writing, don't enter!"

278
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.269
I'm sure the ball flew into that room.

279
00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:57.069
That is...

280
00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:00.769
only if the person living here...

281
00:19:05.469 --> 00:19:09.569
is able to talk.

282
00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:24.369
How about it?

283
00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:27.669
Well, unfortunately...

284
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:32.069
From looks of rigor mortis, he seems to have been dead for an hour or two.

285
00:19:32.069 --> 00:19:37.269
The cracked pieces that are scattered around the corpse shows that

286
00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:40.169
he was probably hit on the back of the head with a flower vase.

287
00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:44.269
Don't tell me that

288
00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:48.769
the ball that I hit struck the flower vase that was on the shelf

289
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:54.969
and hit that man on the head?

290
00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:56.569
Genta.

291
00:19:56.569 --> 00:20:00.369
Oh no, what shall I do?

292
00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:03.369
What shall I do?

293
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:04.569
Idiot.

294
00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:07.969
You hit the ball just a while ago.

295
00:20:07.969 --> 00:20:10.069
Not an hour or two ago, right?

296
00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:13.269
What shall I do? What shall I do?

297
00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:18.269
Besides, your ball seems to have cracked the flower vase over there.

298
00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:21.769
Genta, I'm glad!

299
00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:23.469
Saved!

300
00:20:23.469 --> 00:20:27.869
Which means someone attacked him from behind?

301
00:20:27.869 --> 00:20:30.969
Yeah, he was hit from behind with the flower vase!

302
00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:33.969
When he was looking into the drawer of the desk!

303
00:20:33.969 --> 00:20:38.869
How can you tell he was looking into the drawer?

304
00:20:38.869 --> 00:20:41.269
See, the border between the drawer and the desk,

305
00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:43.869
it's bent out of shape and tilted, right?

306
00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:46.269
When he was hit from behind,

307
00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:47.769
he fell towards the drawer

308
00:20:47.769 --> 00:20:49.969
and it serves as evidence that his body pushed against it!

309
00:20:49.969 --> 00:20:51.469
People usually open the drawer

310
00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:54.269
when they want to look for something in the drawer

311
00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:57.169
or take something out of it!

312
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:58.169
I see.

313
00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:00.069
Just great, Conan.

314
00:21:00.069 --> 00:21:02.669
The thing that bothers me is the room next door.

315
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:06.469
Yeah. The books, mini cars and dolls that are on the shelf

316
00:21:06.469 --> 00:21:09.469
have almost all toppled and are upside down.

317
00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:14.169
If the killer did that, what did the killer intend to do?

318
00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:15.769
Hey!

319
00:21:17.869 --> 00:21:22.169
Just what are you children doing?

320
00:21:22.169 --> 00:21:24.269
Mr. Haramoto?

321
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:27.869
Is that Mr. Haramoto lying on the floor there?

322
00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.569
Hey, Mr. Haramoto?

323
00:21:29.569 --> 00:21:33.569
Haramoto? Mr. Haramoto?

324
00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:36.969
Just what are you doing? Hurry and call the police and ambulance.

325
00:21:36.969 --> 00:21:40.069
Yes, sir, right away.

326
00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:43.469
Come on, children, out of this room!

327
00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:45.269
Yes, sir.

328
00:21:47.069 --> 00:21:49.669
It's a kitty cat.

329
00:21:50.869 --> 00:21:53.569
I wonder where it came in from.

330
00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:54.769
Hi, kitty.

331
00:21:56.469 --> 00:21:58.869
Don't touch my cat!

332
00:22:04.769 --> 00:22:07.369
Hurry. Out, out!

333
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:10.669
When the police arrive, make sure you explain what happened.

334
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:12.669
He doesn't have to talk in that tone of voice.

335
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:14.069
You're right.

336
00:22:14.069 --> 00:22:16.069
Okay?

337
00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:18.169
Yeah. Okay.

338
00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:07.769
By the way, I think it's about time that you realize.

339
00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:12.269
Yes, because there are stranger things in the room on this side.

340
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:13.869
The shelf, shelf!

341
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:18.869
The dolls, mini cars and books are all upside down!

342
00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:20.269
Why?

343
00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:24.469
I see.

344
00:24:24.469 --> 00:24:26.669
The one who turned everything upside down isn't Mr. Haramoto

345
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:27.969
but the killer.

346
00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:33.469
Next Conan, "Result of the Tumble (Part 2)"

347
00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:51.069
Next Conan's Hint:

348
00:24:51.069 --> 00:24:53.369
"Unfinished manuscript"

349
00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:54.669
This is my unfinished manuscript.

350
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:55.969
Genta, it's completely white.

351
00:24:55.969 --> 00:24:58.069
Didn't I tell you that it was unfinished?
