1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,640
We came to enjoy staying at a pension on a southern island,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,240
and ran into actor Mr. Yuya Miyasaka

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,240
who was shooting a promotion video with his staff.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,140
Ever since he got caught for an assault case a year ago,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,940
Mr. Miyasaka's popularity had been on a downfall.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,940
The promotion video was being made to regain his popularity.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,440
However, since he forced his staff to do unreasonable stunts,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,040
and at times got violent with them,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,640
discontent was growing among the staff.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,940
Mr. Miyasaka's ex-girlfriend

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,940
as well as the co-starring actress, Ms. Saeko Akimoto

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,340
seems to have ill feelings

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,940
against the relationship between him and make-up artist, Miki Kitagawa.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,440
And a crime was committed along with the coming of the storm.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,040
Mr. Miyasaka was killed

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,040
in his room in the pension by someone.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,940
A murder is committed in a pension closed off

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,240
because of violent wind and rain.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,940
The culprit is unmistakably in here!

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Like the fog clears.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,240
Let's see through love and crime as well.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,140
The uncomfortable something that Conan feels at the scene of the crime.

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,340
The truth that was recorded on the video camera.

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,040
His name is Detective Conan.

27
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:52,823
"Promotion Video Filming (Part 2)"

28
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:03,923
"Mitsuo Okita (23), Camera Assistant"

29
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:10,023
"Shingo Takayama (28), Cameraman" -Hey.

30
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,023
Just how long do we have to stay in this room?

31
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,623
"Osamu Kurohashi (43), Pension Owner" -Until the police arrive.

32
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,323
"Keiko Kurahashi (38), Osamu's Wife" -If we all stay in the same room,

33
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,123
the culprit won't be able to get away.

34
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,923
"Saeko Akimoto (25), Actress" -Get away?

35
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,123
Where on earth can you get away to

36
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,823
on an isolated island in the storm?

37
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:28,023
"Yamamoto Eiji (21), Assistant Director" -I'm not the culprit,

38
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:30,423
so I don't have to run.

39
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:34,023
"Kitagawa Miki (22), Make-up Artist"

40
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,723
I'm going back to my room.

41
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:40,323
If you want to suspect me as being the culprit, suit yourself.

42
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,023
Rather than that, is the police really going to come?

43
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,523
Mr. Takayama,

44
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:51,323
you really seem concerned about the police, don't you?

45
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,023
Don't tell me that you're...

46
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,423
The culprit?

47
00:03:57,923 --> 00:03:58,923
What's the big deal?

48
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:02,023
I just asked because the police is late getting here!

49
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:05,023
Done with the recording of testimonies!

50
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:08,323
I'm leaving too!

51
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:14,523
It's even more suspicious because he's acting so upset.

52
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:17,423
May I go back to my room too?

53
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,223
Me too, then.

54
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:27,823
If all the four without alibis have left this room,

55
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:32,523
there's no reason why we should be here anymore, is there?

56
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,223
Excuse me.

57
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,423
Everybody's gone.

58
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:48,123
I'm sort of hungry.

59
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:51,423
Of course you're hungry, it's already this late.

60
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:54,823
I'll bring some dishes I can get ready right away and bring them here.

61
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:57,123
Awesome!

62
00:04:57,123 --> 00:05:00,923
I wonder if that man named Mr. Takayama is the culprit after all?

63
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:03,423
Well, I wonder about that.

64
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:07,523
He did look as if he was afraid of the police though.

65
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:09,523
That uncomfortable feeling that something wasn't right

66
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,623
when I saw Mr. Miyasaka's body.

67
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:14,323
I can't helped being bothered about it.

68
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,023
I've got no choice.

69
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,223
If I can't watch the video that was taken,

70
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:22,723
I'll just have to go back to the scene of the crime again and confirm.

71
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,923
I don't have my wallet.

72
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:29,823
I may have dropped it in Mr. Miyasaka's room when I went in a while ago.

73
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:30,823
Huh?

74
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:32,823
How do you know that you didn't drop in other place

75
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:36,123
rather than Mr. Miyasaka's room?

76
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,823
I've got this feeling.

77
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:43,123
Don't do that to me.

78
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:46,223
Okay, I'll go get it for you, then.

79
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:48,823
I'll go with you!

80
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:01,023
You wait here.

81
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:10,323
Poor thing,

82
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,023
the knife is stabbed so deeply into him.

83
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:29,823
Oh, no.

84
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:37,223
He's completely cold...

85
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:43,323
I found my wallet over here!

86
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:46,523
So you found it?

87
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,823
Strange.

88
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,823
The uncomfortable feeling of something being wrong

89
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,623
when I first saw him is gone.

90
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:55,923
Was it just my imagination?

91
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:58,223
We're eating...

92
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,223
It's good!

93
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,823
It sure is good.

94
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:07,623
I'm glad.

95
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:10,423
I wonder if Conan found his wallet?

96
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,823
Miki!

97
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:16,923
I just don't feel comfortable, just the two of us.

98
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:18,923
Could I stay here with you?

99
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:21,623
Sure. Dinner's ready too.

100
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:23,823
Come here next to me.

101
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,223
Thank you.

102
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:30,023
Miki, what's the matter?

103
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,123
I just saw

104
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:34,523
Mr. Takayama run by outside the window.

105
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,423
In this storm?

106
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,123
It can't be!

107
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:41,023
So, Mr. Takayama was the culprit after all!

108
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:43,323
I see. He got scared that the police would come

109
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:45,423
and decided to run for it!

110
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:51,123
Hey, you guys?

111
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,723
Mr. Kurahashi!

112
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,923
What's the matter?

113
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,823
Did something happen?

114
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,523
The culprit fled!

115
00:07:58,523 --> 00:07:59,623
The culprit?

116
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,523
Mr. Takayama!

117
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,023
Miki saw Mr. Takayama

118
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:07,223
outside the window fleeing!

119
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:17,223
Are you sure he went in this direction?

120
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:18,223
Yes.

121
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:21,123
He went running eastward.

122
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:24,323
But, there's a cliff ahead and it's a dead end.

123
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:34,123
Hey, Mr. Takayama!

124
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:35,423
Hey!

125
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:38,523
Mr. Takayama!

126
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:42,623
This is...

127
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:47,523
Mr. Takayama.

128
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:06,723
They're exhausted and all fell asleep.

129
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:10,423
After Mr. Miyasaka, now Mr. Takayama is dead.

130
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:14,223
He was probably fleeing and couldn't see in the dark,

131
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:17,323
so slipped and fell over the cliff.

132
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,923
How stupid can he get.

133
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,523
But, at least it's good that we know who the culprit was, now.

134
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,023
So, the case is closed.

135
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:33,523
But I wonder if Mr. Takayama was really the culprit?

136
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,623
Of course, there's no mistake about it!

137
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,223
Can you think of another reason

138
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,723
why someone would go bursting out on a stormy night like this?

139
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:43,223
But, he should've known that even if he went bursting out,

140
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,023
there is no way off this island, right?

141
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:46,823
Well...

142
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:51,623
Let's say that Mr. Takayama was the culprit,

143
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:55,323
the story fits into place too well for him to coincidentally lose his life.

144
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,923
Maybe Mr. Takayama was also killed.

145
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,323
In other words,

146
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:03,423
we haven't cleared off the list of suspects yet, have we?

147
00:10:03,423 --> 00:10:05,723
Since Mr. Takayama is dead,

148
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,823
you probably want to say that the three of us,

149
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:11,423
that is, Mr. Okita, Yamamoto and I are the suspects, right?

150
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,423
I'm not the culprit!

151
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:15,923
I'll show you proof of it right now!

152
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:20,323
I'll show you the video that I took when I went to Mr. Miyasaka's room!

153
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:21,323
If you watch this,

154
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:24,823
it should show you that I didn't kill Miyasaka.

155
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,923
Is he going to play that video?

156
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:30,923
I'm sorry, but as I mentioned before, I can't bear watching that video.

157
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,323
Yeah, Mr. Miyasaka's dead body is taken.

158
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:37,123
But, it's to prove that I'm innocent!

159
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:40,423
I'm sorry but if you can't bear watching it, keep your eyes closed!

160
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,170
Okay, I'm going to play it.

161
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,270
I'm Okita, in charge of the behind-the-scenes.

162
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,670
I'm going to charge into Mr. Miyasaka's room from now.

163
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,170
This is Mr. Miyasaka's room.

164
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,270
So, I wonder what Mr. Miyasaka is doing right now?

165
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,770
The door is slightly opened.

166
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,170
There's something stuck between the door.

167
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,570
It looks to be a bottle of foundation.

168
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,770
Okay, I'm going inside.

169
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,070
What's wrong?

170
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,870
Mr. Takayama, Mr. Miyasaka is...

171
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,170
Miyasaka! No way?

172
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,070
Okita! Go get everybody!

173
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,770
Yes, sir!

174
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,170
How about it?

175
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,470
When I went there, Mr. Miyasaka was already dead!

176
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,470
Now, you know I didn't do it, right?

177
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,670
Which means

178
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,170
that either Saeko or Mr. Yamamoto did it.

179
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,470
Hey! Cut out saying weird stuff like that!

180
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,770
She's right! I didn't do it!

181
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,970
I've finally figured out what was bothering me.

182
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,670
Conan.

183
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,170
I got go to the restroom.

184
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,470
Sonoko? Don't tell me that...

185
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,170
What's going on?

186
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,170
When Sonoko dances this dance,

187
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,170
she turns into a great detective called the Deduction Queen!

188
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,470
Deduction Queen?

189
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,670
Maybe we've been making a big mistake.

190
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,670
Mr. Okita, I'm sorry to trouble you

191
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,870
but will you show us the video one more time?

192
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,070
Yeah.

193
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,870
Please show us the part where Mr. Miyasaka's dead body is displayed.

194
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,770
I think it's just about here.

195
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,970
Mr. Yamamoto,

196
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,570
are you sure that there's no mistake

197
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,570
about this knife being the prop that was used?

198
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,970
Yes. I think so.

199
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,270
Please take a good look at it.

200
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,270
Doesn't something look wrong?

201
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,570
Something wrong?

202
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,870
The coke stain's not there!

203
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,370
True!

204
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,270
There's no stain on the handle of the knife.

205
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,270
Hold it.

206
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,870
When I went to look for Conan's wallet a while ago,

207
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,870
I took another good look at the dead body...

208
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,770
and I'm sure that the handle of the knife was stained with coke!

209
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,070
Yes.

210
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,970
This means that there were two knives.

211
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,470
What?

212
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,870
Two knives?

213
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,070
Wait, then what?

214
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,570
Do you mean that after he was stabbed once,

215
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,570
he was stabbed again with another knife?

216
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,870
Why would anybody do something like that?

217
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,870
And besides, if so, then when was the knife

218
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,870
stabbed into him a second time?

219
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,070
The room is auto locked and the door was locked.

220
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,370
Nobody could've gotten inside unless with the master key!

221
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,070
But, the door can be opened from inside the room.

222
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,470
From inside the room?

223
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,370
But, only Mr. Miyasaka's body was in the room.

224
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,870
What if Mr. Miyasaka wasn't dead yet then?

225
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,070
What is your remark based on anyway?

226
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,270
My remarked is based on the

227
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,670
existence of that bottle of liquid foundation.

228
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,170
The bottle of liquid foundation

229
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,070
that was stuck between the door of Mr. Miyasaka's room.

230
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,370
It's much too unnatural that it was left

231
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,970
standing upside down stuck between the door.

232
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,370
Don't you sense there was something intentional here?

233
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,270
Intentional?

234
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,370
A liquid foundation bottle left standing upside down?

235
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,470
Liquid foundation bottle standing upside down...

236
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,470
Candid!

237
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,170
Exactly! He was going to make a candid camera video

238
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,370
and surprise everyone by pretending to be dead.

239
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,270
It's most likely that the first knife

240
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,370
that was stabbed into him without the coke stain on.

241
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,370
It was a fake knife with no sharp tip to it.

242
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,870
The blood was paint that's usually used when shooting films

243
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,170
that was spread over the body.

244
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,170
He was planning to make a candid camera video

245
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,670
by making us find him that way and shocking us.

246
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,870
Mr. Miyasaka would surely come up with something like that.

247
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,970
No,

248
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,070
this is something that the culprit conned Mr. Miyasaka into doing.

249
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,070
The culprit wanted to use it to kill him.

250
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,870
However, Mr. Miyasaka did something

251
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,070
that was not included in the culprit's plan.

252
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,870
Mr. Miyasaka who was totally unaware

253
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,270
that he was really going to be killed.

254
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,370
Playfully put the bottle of foundation where it was.

255
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,570
That, although unintentionally turned out to be his dying message.

256
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,770
By the way, he needed an accomplice

257
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,170
to work out this liquid foundation thing.

258
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,770
An accomplice?

259
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,570
Come to think of it, back then...

260
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,070
He's got no pulse.

261
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,270
It's too late.

262
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,370
Mr. Takayama was the one who confirmed Mr. Miyasaka's death.

263
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,870
So, could it be that he was the accomplice?

264
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,870
So, it wasn't a coincidence

265
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,670
that he appeared at just the right timing.

266
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,770
What's wrong?

267
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,070
Okita! Go get everyone!

268
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,670
He did so, to keep me away from Mr. Miyasaka.

269
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,570
Then, Mr. Takayama is the culprit after all?

270
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,670
No.

271
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,670
Mr. Takayama couldn't have killed Mr. Miyasaka.

272
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,570
Because the crime was committed not after the video was recorded

273
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,570
and we returned to the room

274
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,470
after hearing that Mr. Miyasaka was dead.

275
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,470
But between the time we left Mr. Miyasaka's room

276
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,070
and Mr. Kurahashi went inside the room the second time.

277
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,970
During that time, we were all in the lobby.

278
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,370
With the exception of one person.

279
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,670
Yes.

280
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,670
The one who could've committed the crime at that time...

281
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,970
Miki, I think you should go back to your room and rest.

282
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,270
All right.

283
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,270
Excuse me.

284
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,370
Is none other than you, Miki!

285
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,770
When you told Mr. Miyasaka and Mr. Takayama

286
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,470
about your candid camera video plan,

287
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,670
they both though it was interesting and agreed to it.

288
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,870
So, just as you planned,

289
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,370
since we thought that Mr. Miyasaka was murdered,

290
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,970
we sealed the room off.

291
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,470
After everyone left, you went back to Mr. Miyasaka's room.

292
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,270
Then, Mr. Miyasaka who was still alive opened the door

293
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,870
and let Miki in.

294
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,670
If it went according as planned,

295
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,270
they were both going to appear before everyone

296
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,070
and disclose what happened.

297
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:16,170
But, this time, he was stabbed in the chest with one blow.

298
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,570
After lying the dead body in exactly the same position as before,

299
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,870
Miki left the room.

300
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,070
The door is auto locked, so it will lock itself as before.

301
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,970
This way, you acquired a definite alibi for you alone.

302
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,670
Then, you mean Mr. Takayama was...

303
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,170
Mr. Takayama probably thought it strange

304
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,670
that Mr. Miyasaka didn't appear to disclose the trick.

305
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,670
I guess you all noticed that he seemed jittery and bothered.

306
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,770
If Mr. Takayama finds out that Mr. Miyasaka was really killed,

307
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,470
Miki's alibi trick would be revealed.

308
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,670
That's why she called Mr. Takayama out to the cliff.

309
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,670
Then she comes back to the lobby looking as if nothing had happened.

310
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,570
She lies and says she saw Mr. Takayama fleeing

311
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,070
and tried to set him up as the culprit.

312
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,370
It's not a lie! I really saw him!

313
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,470
There's no way you could've seen him.

314
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,170
Because even if you were to look outside in the dark

315
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,270
from this brightly lit lobby,

316
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,570
only the reflection of the inside of this room

317
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,170
would be seen on the window,

318
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,270
and nothing outside can possibly be in view!

319
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,670
Don't just sit there, say something!

320
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,470
I did it.

321
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,870
Miki!

322
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,370
No.

323
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,470
I was a nameless actress in the past.

324
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,870
One day, I received a really big role

325
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,070
as a guest on a drama that Miyasaka was starring in.

326
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,870
I went right away to report this

327
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,270
to my only relative, my grandmother.

328
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,870
She was ill in bed, but was very happy for me,

329
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,370
and was looking forward to the day

330
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,670
the program would be aired.

331
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,570
However...

332
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,670
Takayama and Miyasaka got drunk and were arrested for assault,

333
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,570
so the drama was cancelled.

334
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,670
The part that I acted wasn't aired

335
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,170
and my grandmother passed away.

336
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,170
If those two didn't cause that incident,

337
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,470
I would've been able to show her my performance.

338
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,870
Ever since then, I never landed a big part.

339
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,770
And I gave up pursuing my acting career...

340
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,370
Just to think that

341
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,870
it was all due to Miyasaka and Takayama getting into trouble,

342
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,370
I couldn't forgive them.

343
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,970
And yet, those guys...

344
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,270
I'm not going to have my acting career go down the drain

345
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,770
just because of that stupid incident!

346
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,170
I'm going to go back to being a star again!

347
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,670
To think that the guy who shows no act of repentance

348
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,970
what so ever gets to continue being an actor as if nothing happened

349
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,670
while I had to give up mine

350
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,370
is just not right!

351
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,370
That's why...

352
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,970
Enough of your spoiled talk!

353
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,970
In the world of acting things are known not to go well.

354
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,870
Nevertheless, we all clench our teeth and give it all we got.

355
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,770
You can't land a good role before you haven't worked hard enough for it.

356
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,670
Whether you decide to give it up or not is all up to you.

357
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,670
And yet, you not only blame it on somebody else,

358
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,870
you go as far as to kill them.

359
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,270
So much for acting spoiled!

360
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,070
After police investigation,

361
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,670
the fake knife was found in Miki's room.

362
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,270
Oh, no. I over slept.

363
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,170
Hey I'm still here!

364
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,770
Hey, don't leave me behind.

365
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,370
Candid camera succeeds!

366
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,770
No joke!

367
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,770
"Next Episode" -That guy is the stalker?

368
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,270
Yep, he came yesterday and the day before yesterday too.

369
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,670
If he falls from that height, he's going be critically hurt.

370
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,470
He was probably using your practice for something.

371
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,070
How dare he use Ayumi for something like that!

372
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,370
Right! Let's get the culprit at all costs!

373
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,870
Next Conan,

374
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,958
"The Flower Clock Knows"

375
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:23,397
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:24,897
"Paint"

377
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,597
Flower clocks are nice.

378
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:27,997
Let's go get something to eat.

379
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:29,797
That's what you call a stomach clock.
