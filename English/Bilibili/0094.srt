1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,680
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,000
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,710
Today is the legendary Snow Woman!
A heart-chilling and sad case!

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,090
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,050
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,670
His name?

00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,359

Genbee Ski Lodge

9
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,609
Though my body may die,

10
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:57,039
know that my spirit will
someday be revived with the snow!

11
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,589
Love of the Snow Woman - To Be Continued

12
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,299
It's always such a powerful show!

13
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:13,969
W-What's this?

14
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,439
It's a mechanical doll.

15
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,929
Have some tea!

16
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,189
A doll, huh?

17
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,519
It's really well-made!

18
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:29,489
That's a rare thing you have!

19
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:30,869
The previous owners of this place left it behind.

The previous owners of this place left it behind.

21
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,249
Were you watching
the Snow Woman on TV?
Lodge Owner
Genbee's Wife

22
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,409
Were you watching
the Snow Woman on TV?

23
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,559
Yes!

24
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,399
She was really scary!

25
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:43,169
But Snow Women aren't for real!

26
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:45,229
That's not true!

27
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:49,469
This area is famous for
its Snow Woman sightings!

28
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:53,929
Who knows, maybe she'll
even show up tonight!

29
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,769
Good evening!

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,609
Kinoshita Akiko (26) Actress
Are we really staying here, Yoko?

31
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,479
How is this a "great inn"?
Kinoshita Akiko (26) Actress

32
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,109
Asanuma Yoko (26) Actress
But there's no other place to stay,

33
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,189
and the bus already left!
Asanuma Yoko (26) Actress

34
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,109
Welcome!

35
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,119
Hello! I made a
reservation the other day!

36
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,019
Yes, yes! Kinoshita Akiko-san
and Asanuma Yoko-san, yes?

37
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,039
Thank you for coming all this way!
Your skis have already arrived!

38
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,759
What?! Did you just say
"Kinoshita Akiko-san"?!

39
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,519
Whoa! It's really you!

40
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,729
I was just watching
"Love of the Snow Woman" on TV!

41
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:39,639
Hey! It's Kinoshita Akiko-san,
the actress! In the flesh!

42
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,729
I'm Mori Kogoro, the detective!

43
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:51,109
Oh! That scene where you throw
yourself into the lake was amazing!

44
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,159
You fell straight for
the lake, like, "Whoosh!"

45
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:57,689
It was actually Yoko
who did that dive, not me.

46
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,829
I'm a stuntwoman.

47
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,619
Oh, so you act out dangerous
scenes in the place of main actors?

48
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:11,859
Yoko is my exclusive stuntwoman.
My double, you could even say!

49
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:16,339
Umm, where might the
restroom be? It's so chilly outside...

50
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,179
Oh, the restroom is--

51
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,889
At the far end of
the hall, on the left.

52
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,649
Does our room have
a view of a persimmon tree?

53
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,919
Yes, just as you requested!

54
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,279
Let's hit the hay, Conan-kun.

55
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:37,859
Yeah.

56
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:42,559
Say, Ran-neechan. Yoko-san
said this is her first time here, right?

57
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:45,709
So how did she know
where the bathroom was?

58
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:50,519
Oh, you're so curious
about everything, Conan-kun!

59
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,009
Aren't bathrooms usually
always in the same general area?

60
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,769
Especially in older buildings like this!

61
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,349
I hope the weather is clear tomorrow!

62
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,119
T-The Snow Woman!
Conan-kun! The Snow Woman!

63
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,119
What? The Snow Woman?

64
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,249
There's no one out there.

65
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:31,169
That can't be! I saw her!

66
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,919
What's all the commotion?

67
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,049
Dad! I saw the Snow Woman!

68
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,009
The Snow Woman?!

69
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,689
No one's out there.

70
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,689
You were just so
afraid of the Snow Woman

71
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,439
that a pile of snow
looked like her to you!

72
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,359
Really? It was just my imagination?

73
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:03,769
Yes! I'll be back tomorrow evening!

74
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,229
So I'd like to schedule
a body massage and a facial!

75
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,149
Great! Thank you!

76
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,289
Akiko-san. Don't forget these.

77
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:13,709
Oh, right!

78
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,679
You almost look like a bank robber gang!

79
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,439
Actresses can't afford to be sunburned.

80
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,019
Move! Look out!

81
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:35,859
Coming through!

82
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,699
Oh! There's Yoko-san and Akiko-san!

83
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,359
Mountain weather sure changes fast.

84
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,679
This snow came out of nowhere.

85
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,679
Oh, Yoko-san! Are you by yourself?

86
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:12,899
Yes. Akiko-san wanted
to ski for a little bit longer.

87
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,649
Akiko-san sure is full of power!

88
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,899
No, she pretends to be full of energy...

89
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,689
...but she's actually not well.

90
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:24,319
See you later!

91
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,869
Akiko-san not being well...
Is she sick somehow?

92
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,329
Yeah. I'm concerned.

93
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,519
I'm back!

94
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,799
Has Yoko returned yet?

95
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,799
Yes! Just now!

96
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,669
Do you suppose she caught a cold?

97
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,269
You're a real life-saver!

98
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,899
Not at all!

99
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,899
That was a delicious meal!

100
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,449
Akiko-san was coughing.
Is she all right?

101
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:07,619
Yes. She doesn't seem
to have an appetite, though.

102
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,579
She's resting now.

103
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,039
Miss! Can we use the bath?

104
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,499
Yes, go right ahead!
You have it to yourselves until 8:00!

105
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,409
Okay!

106
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,769
You can take a bath
after 8:00, Ran-chan!

107
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,429
And you have the
men's bath all to yourselves!

108
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,559
Akiko-san. Are you all right?
You really should see a doctor.

109
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,019
Yes, I'll do that.
I think I'll get out for now.

110
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,729
Okay. I think I'll stay in a little longer.

111
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,899
Mori-san! Are you there?

112
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,699
Yes!

113
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:50,489
What do you say to
having an after-bath drink?

114
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,659
I-I'd love to!

115
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,169
Oh, so they're making it into a play?

116
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,309
Yes! It received such critical acclaim!

117
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,359
Just like on TV, Akiko-san's
going to play the main character!

118
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,639
I assume you're going to be in it too?!

119
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,359
Yes, but of course!
Please come and watch!

120
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,309
Here!

121
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,359
Of course I'll go to see you!

122
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,269
Oh, I guess there
wasn't very much in here.

123
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:23,309
Hey, Conan. Go bring us some beer.

124
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,199
It's already 10:00.
The owners are asleep now.

125
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,869
I have some whiskey in
my room, if you'd prefer that!

126
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,359
Oh, uhh...

127
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:33,689
Let's drink a little more!
I'll go get it!

128
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,359
Dad!

129
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,229
Oh, come on!

130
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,859
Let's have fun tonight!

131
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,729
Oh? What about the whiskey?

132
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:54,649
Actually, it's apparently at
the bottom of Akiko-san's suitcase,

133
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,439
so she said she'll
bring it to us in a bit.

134
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,209
Akiko-san will?

135
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,399
Oh! Is that her?

136
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,859
Oh, I'll go check.

137
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,399
Thanks--

138
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,569
Not yet?

139
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:15,269
No, still not yet.

140
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:17,559
Oh! I think that is her now!

141
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,559
Thanks, Akiko-san!

142
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,149
The whiskey's here!

143
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:32,519
I had so much fun!

144
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,189
Me too!

145
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,979
Well, Ran-san.
Go on ahead to the bath.

146
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:40,399
I'm going to check on
Akiko-san real quick first.

147
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:41,409
Okay!

148
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,309
Huh?

149
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,649
What is it?

150
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:55,689
I don't seem to remember that
doll being there when I looked earlier.

151
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,619
But it's there.

152
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,039
Uh oh! Did I drink a little too much?

153
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,409
Where could Yoko-san be?

154
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,379
T-That's...

155
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,339
...the Snow Woman!

156
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,679
You saw her?

157
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,889
I really did! She was
wearing a white kimono!

158
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,599
Mori-san! It's terrible! It's Akiko-san!

159
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,769
What about her?

160
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,899
Look at this! It's Akiko-san's will!

161
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:25,899
Will?!

162
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,029
She was gone when I returned to our room!
Will

163
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,859
I checked around the building,
but I couldn't find her!

164
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,869
Then, when I checked
our room closer, I found that!

165
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,289
Akiko-san has lung cancer?!

166
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:43,789
I don't know! But her strange
coughing had her worried, too!

167
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,459
She says her father
suffered from the same illness...

168
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,919
I heard he died of lung cancer...

169
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:55,729
She may have been
secretly worried she had cancer too.

170
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,969
"I want to die as the Snow Woman..."

171
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:04,019
Then the Snow Woman I saw just now...?!

172
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,939
It might've been Akiko-san!

173
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
Yoko-san. Contact the police right away.

174
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,359
It's very cold out! We need to
find Akiko-san as quickly as possible!

175
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,489
Right!

176
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,649
Alright! We're going out to
search, too! Get ready right away!

177
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:20,409
Right!

178
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:24,859
But, mister! Akiko-san made
a beauty salon appointment!

179
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,669
Would someone committing suicide
really schedule an appointment?

180
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:30,129
She probably decided to kill
herself in the spur of the moment!

181
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,719
Akiko-san!
Hey!

182
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,579
Please say something!

183
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,429
Akiko-san!

184
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,059
Akiko-san!

185
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,519
The next morning,

186
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:54,319
Akiko-san was found dead,
wearing her Snow Woman costume.

187
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:06,709
Akiko-san! Akiko-san!

188
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,209
I guess there's no doubt
she is Kinoshita Akiko-san.

189
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,649
Thank you for your hard work.

190
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,019
And you are?

191
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,139
I'm Mori Kogoro, a detective.
I was staying in the same lodge.

192
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,449
Oh! You're that famous detective?
Detective Kawada, Mikkamachi Police

193
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:22,359
Oh! You're that famous detective?

194
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:25,189
I'm Kawada, of the Mikkamachi Police.

195
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:29,859
Actually, there was a sedative
bottle lying next to Akiko-san.

196
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:35,529
Akiko-san brought the
whiskey after 10:00 pm.

197
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,449
Meaning she committed suicide after then.

198
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:42,949
I think the Snow Woman
I saw was probably Akiko-san.

199
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:46,659
This is how the scene
looked when we found her.

200
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,209
What the--?! Could it be?!

201
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,189
Since this was a suicide,

202
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:58,929
help from the Great Detective
Mori probably won't be needed.

203
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,339
Signs that someone climbed up!

204
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,409
What are you doing, Conan-kun?

205
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:24,769
Say. Where is the previous
owner of this lodge now?

206
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,399
Huh? The previous owner?

207
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,859
He lives in the next village over now.

208
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:32,539
Why do you ask?

209
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,009
There's something I'd like to ask him.

210
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,339
Huh?

211
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,729
This was no suicide! It was a murder!

212
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:44,179
And the killer was that person!

213
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,799
I'm going to send the body
off for mandatory autopsy now.

214
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,299
Though it's pretty clear it's a suicide.

215
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,759
Oh no!

216
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:05,349
You must not take that body away!

217
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,279
Kinoshita Akiko-san's death
was a murder, not a suicide!

218
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,629
Mori-san! What evidence do
you have it was a murder?!

219
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,129
Detective Kawada.

220
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,539
Look closer at the photographs
from when her body was found.

221
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,419
Akiko-san's hair is inside
the collar of the kimono.

222
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:33,169
A person seeking out death
wouldn't wear clothes so brazenly.

223
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,379
Someone changed her clothes.

224
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,839
W-Who?!

225
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,389
It was you, Asanuma Yoko-san!

226
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:46,799
Mori-san! You know Akiko-san
wasn't in a normal state of mind!

227
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,939
I doubt she worried about her
hair when putting on the kimono!

228
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,899
Detective Kawada.
Please look at the photographs.

229
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:58,819
It appears her body was
buried quite deeply in the snow.

230
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:05,419
The snow started yesterday around
5:00 pm and ended around 8:00.

231
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:08,829
If Akiko-san had killed
herself after 10:00 last night,

232
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,749
her body wouldn't have
been buried in that much snow.

233
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:17,049
And one other thing.
Look closely at Akiko-san's face.

234
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,219
She has a foundation on to prevent sunburn.

235
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:24,799
Would someone at night,
and someone about to commit suicide,

236
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,139
really put such a foundation on?

237
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,769
Yes, she does have foundation on!

238
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:36,299
Akiko-san was most likely given
the sedative without her realizing it.

239
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,739
And no one else but you
could have done that, Yoko-san!

240
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,999
But, Mori-san! You all
saw Akiko-san last night!

241
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:49,459
What we saw was
you acting as Akiko-san.

242
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,959
Acting?! What do you mean?!

243
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,469
You were the one
who invited Akiko-san skiing

244
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:57,919
and booked a room here.

245
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,169
Why did you choose this place?

246
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,849
Because it would be easiest
to play two people at once here.

247
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:07,129
Two people at once?

248
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:10,309
You and Akiko-san share similar stature.

249
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:16,379
After killing her, you needed
to make it appear she was still alive.

250
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:19,029
That's why you chose this lodge.

251
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:21,989
But isn't this Yoko-san's first time here?

252
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,379
Yoko-san.

253
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:28,169
You worked here part-time one
winter during your student days.

254
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:31,209
The previous owner
remembered your name.

255
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:38,169
Yesterday, you gave her
the sedative to knock her out.

256
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,299
You then put her in her Snow
Woman outfit and left her outside.

257
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,599
Lucky for you, it had just started to snow.

258
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,559
But what you didn't count on
was the snow stopping soon after.

259
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,029
Ran. The Snow Woman you
saw our first day here was Yoko-san.

260
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,049
She covered herself with a white
kimono to keep from standing out

261
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,989
as she went to hide another kimono.

262
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:07,549
There were two Snow Woman outfits:

263
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:11,409
one for Akiko-san and one
for Yoko-san, the stuntwoman.

264
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,879
She buried one of
them in the snow in advance.

265
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:18,459
Then, the following day,
yesterday evening to be precise,

266
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:22,589
she put it on the sleeping Akiko-san.

267
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:30,309
Then you returned here
as if nothing had happened.

268
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,389
But Akiko-san came back, too!

269
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:38,669
You disguised yourself as her
as soon as you returned to your room.

270
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,169
To make it seem like the
dead Akiko-san was still quite alive.

271
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:47,329
You climbed to the roof via the
persimmon tree outside your window.

272
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,669
As a stuntwoman,
that would be simple to do.

273
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:56,629
You then put on Akiko-san's
ski boots, which you had hidden,

274
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:59,799
and returned with her skis.

275
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:06,719
You also played the role of two
people for us in the open-air bath.

276
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:11,219
You, if anyone, can
imitate Akiko-san's voice.

277
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:15,769
The final touch was the
Snow Woman that Ran saw from the bath.

278
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,169
You were pretending to be
Akiko-san as she strode off to die,

279
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:24,699
to make it look like
she had committed suicide

280
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:29,619
and that she had still
been alive at that point.

281
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,579
Then what about the
whiskey she brought us?

282
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:39,839
Yes, that was another act of yours.
We never saw Akiko-san's face.

283
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,719
But I received the whiskey!

284
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:48,299
If Akiko-san was dead,
just who brought the whiskey?!

285
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:52,969
You chose this lodge
for one other reason:

286
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:55,629
the mechanical doll.

287
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,979
You went to get the whiskey.

288
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:01,439
But you had the
mechanical doll bring it.

289
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:07,199
Then, when I went to look,

290
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:09,969
the doll was nowhere to be seen.

291
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,799
But it wasn't my imagination;

292
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,129
the doll was actually behind me.

293
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,169
Thanks, Akiko-san!

294
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,259
You later returned
the doll to its platform

295
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,799
when pretending to use the restroom.

296
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,139
In other words, you used
the doll to fill in for Akiko-san.

297
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:41,609
Akiko-san's fingerprints
should be missing from the bottle.

298
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:48,649
And that's more proof than
anything that she no longer existed.

299
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:57,119
I... I drugged Akiko-san... and killed her.

300
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:01,379
I also wrote the will.

301
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:05,129
The part about her father's death was true,

302
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,669
but there was nothing wrong with her at all.

303
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,129
Then why?

304
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:13,879
I was always being outdone by her.

305
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:17,259
I made it to the final audition
of my very first drama role,

306
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,639
and lost to Akiko-san!

307
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,099
It was always the same ever since!

308
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,589
I would always lose to
her in the final audition!

309
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,879
She went on to become a star,

310
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,109
while all I ever heard was,

311
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:36,629
"You look like Kinoshita Akiko.
We don't want a copycat show."

312
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:42,469
When I thought I'd always be her
double as long as she was around...

313
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,629
It's the Snow Man! The Snow Man!

314
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:49,409
Oh! It's you, Sachiko-san!

315
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,539
The old guy fell asleep along the way?!

316
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:02,669
But he was awake until
9:00, chatting with Sachiko-san!

317
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:04,259
Her alibi is airtight!

318
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:07,469
Wait a minute!

319
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,499
On the next Conan:
"Kogoro's Date Murder Case."
