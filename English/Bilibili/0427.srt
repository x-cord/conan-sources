1
00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.467
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:04.367
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:05.767
A composed and intelligent girl.

4
00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.367
On the 4th grader who resembles Haibara!

5
00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.267
An unexpected accident closes in.

6
00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.667
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.467
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.367
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:10.777
Yaiba Kick!

10
00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:12.077
See? I look like him, don't I?

11
00:02:12.077 --> 00:02:13.977
Yeah, you look just like him!

12
00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:16.377
Genta, stop talking and clean up!

13
00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:24.077
Stop! So you've come, mole monster!

14
00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.577
Masked Yaiba!

15
00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:27.677
Hey! Genta Kojima!

16
00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:30.477
Yes!

17
00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:31.877
Hey, Genta.

18
00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:34.877
Stop playing and let's finish cleaning.

19
00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:38.377
If you don't cut it out, I'm going to tell the teacher!

20
00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:41.977
Although my appearance is that of an elementary school student...

21
00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:47.477
even the teacher doesn't get me nervous.

22
00:02:50.377 --> 00:02:52.677
Genta!

23
00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:55.877
Well, peacefulness is best I guess.

24
00:02:59.577 --> 00:03:01.977
Let's finish up quickly!

25
00:03:04.677 --> 00:03:06.577
Bad news...

26
00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:18.077
Bad news.

27
00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:19.577
It hurts.

28
00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:21.377
Are you all right, Mitsuhiko?

29
00:03:21.377 --> 00:03:24.277
What's the rush?

30
00:03:24.277 --> 00:03:26.577
A case!

31
00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:28.377
-A case? -A case?

32
00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:31.277
A 4th grade girl disappeared!

33
00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.377
-Disappeared? -Disappeared?

34
00:03:33.377 --> 00:03:34.577
Yes.

35
00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:38.777
Actually, her big sister and my big sister are classmates.

36
00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:39.777
When I was small,

37
00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:43.377
she used to come over to my house with her big sister to play.

38
00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:46.577
That's how I got to know her.

39
00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:50.077
But I suddenly got a call from her yesterday

40
00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:54.077
and we promised to walk home together today.

41
00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:56.977
So I went to her classroom a while ago...

42
00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:01.677
and was told that she didn't come to school today.

43
00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:04.277
Maybe she caught a cold?

44
00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.077
That couldn't be!

45
00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:09.677
I called her house, but no one answered.

46
00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:12.277
And besides, she...

47
00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:14.877
She told me that she wanted to ask us to do something,

48
00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:16.277
so to please bring everyone along too

49
00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:18.777
and go home together no matter what!

50
00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:22.477
Everybody? You mean the Youth Detective Squad?

51
00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:23.577
Yes.

52
00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:26.277
She said she'd let me know the details on the way home.

53
00:04:26.277 --> 00:04:29.277
She sounded really troubled and concerned.

54
00:04:29.277 --> 00:04:33.277
What is her name and what is she like?

55
00:04:33.277 --> 00:04:37.177
She's in 4th grade, Class A. Her name is Shoko Amemiya

56
00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:38.777
and she has brown hair.

57
00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:39.977
Brown hair?

58
00:04:39.977 --> 00:04:41.577
That is a bit curly.

59
00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:44.477
A bob cut.

60
00:04:44.477 --> 00:04:45.677
Yes.

61
00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:48.477
She looked a lot like Haibara!

62
00:04:54.977 --> 00:04:56.277
It can't be...

63
00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:04.977
"Super Secret School Zone (Part 1)"

64
00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:08.377
Hi! Did you finish cleaning up?

65
00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:10.877
Ms. Kobayashi...

66
00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:13.977
Oh, boy.

67
00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:14.977
And?

68
00:05:14.977 --> 00:05:17.377
What's the school side saying?

69
00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:19.577
Were they contacted by her family?

70
00:05:19.577 --> 00:05:21.377
Well...

71
00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:23.277
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:23.277 --> 00:05:26.877
It's about Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade Class A.

73
00:05:26.877 --> 00:05:29.477
Oh, Shoko Amemiya.

74
00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:33.377
She was scheduled to be absent to begin with today.

75
00:05:33.377 --> 00:05:36.177
She has to attend a funeral for an uncle who lives in Kyushu.

76
00:05:36.177 --> 00:05:38.377
But on her way home yesterday,

77
00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:42.077
she said that she was coming to school today and won't be absent.

78
00:05:42.077 --> 00:05:45.077
So I was worried, too.

79
00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:48.977
Maybe she changed her mind and decided to go today after all.

80
00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:51.377
Her homeroom teacher, Mr. Hirayama,

81
00:05:51.377 --> 00:05:54.077
was also saying that he thinks so, too.

82
00:05:54.077 --> 00:05:55.877
Mr. Hirayama?

83
00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:57.777
Was there a teacher by that name?

84
00:05:57.777 --> 00:06:00.077
I never heard of him.

85
00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:05.477
It's no wonder you don't know him because he's still new.

86
00:06:05.477 --> 00:06:08.477
He came in place of the teacher that got into a traffic accident.

87
00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:12.477
Traffic accident?

88
00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:15.477
Well, I guess she'll be addressing all of you

89
00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:18.177
this coming Monday during morning assembly.

90
00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.277
Ms. Kobayashi.

91
00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.977
When did that traffic accident happen?

92
00:06:21.977 --> 00:06:24.277
This past Monday.

93
00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:27.277
Two days after their attempted assassination incident.

94
00:06:27.277 --> 00:06:32.177
Were you able to get in touch with her parents who went to Kyushu?

95
00:06:32.177 --> 00:06:34.577
I'm sure we'll be able to soon.

96
00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:36.877
We made a call to the home in Kyushu

97
00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:40.277
and the people there told us that her family should be arriving by sundown.

98
00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:43.277
Okay, I'm going to lock up,

99
00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:45.377
so you children go on home.

100
00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:47.477
Okay, will do...

101
00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.877
After we stop off at 4th grade class A.

102
00:07:30.377 --> 00:07:31.977
Even a dorky cap like this

103
00:07:31.977 --> 00:07:35.077
looks nice when a really cute girl wears it. See.

104
00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:37.377
Give it back to me!

105
00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:39.577
Let's see...

106
00:07:39.577 --> 00:07:41.777
So putting together the opinion of the class,

107
00:07:41.777 --> 00:07:46.477
Shoko Amemiya is smart, good in all subjects, reticent and calm.

108
00:07:46.477 --> 00:07:48.377
On the other hand, when the time comes when she needs to say something,

109
00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:50.277
she is straightforward.

110
00:07:50.277 --> 00:07:52.777
Although she is thought by some boys to be distasteful,

111
00:07:52.777 --> 00:07:54.877
she was quite popular with girls.

112
00:07:54.877 --> 00:07:57.177
She sounds just like Ai!

113
00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:02.077
But in Haibara's case, she's also popular among boys.

114
00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:03.177
Thank you.

115
00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:04.177
Not at all.

116
00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:07.277
By the way, Haibara,

117
00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:09.877
why were you wearing a cap?

118
00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:11.777
That's Conan's cap, isn't it?

119
00:08:13.977 --> 00:08:17.777
It's good sometimes, don't you think?

120
00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:20.277
Yes, very boyish!

121
00:08:20.277 --> 00:08:21.677
It looks awesome!

122
00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:27.477
What I'm asking is why are you wearing Conan's cap, Haibara?

123
00:08:27.477 --> 00:08:30.777
Is there some kind of regulation that says she can't wear Conan's cap?

124
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.077
Well...

125
00:08:34.777 --> 00:08:37.477
If that girl had the same kind of personality as Ai,

126
00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:38.677
it's very unlikely that she would've been deceived by a weirdo

127
00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:40.877
and kidnapped.

128
00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:42.077
The possibilities remaining

129
00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:44.677
are that she got involved in some sort of accident or maybe...

130
00:08:44.677 --> 00:08:47.977
The new teacher that came is one of their members

131
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:50.777
and abducted her after mistaking her for me.

132
00:08:50.777 --> 00:08:54.077
Idiot! Not much time has passed since then.

133
00:08:54.077 --> 00:08:55.777
They're working too fast.

134
00:08:55.777 --> 00:08:58.977
It's pretty slow for those people

135
00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:01.077
if they figured out

136
00:09:01.077 --> 00:09:04.577
that you're the one who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

137
00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.077
Besides, this cap

138
00:09:06.077 --> 00:09:10.377
is a protection in case that's what happened, isn't it?

139
00:09:10.377 --> 00:09:12.777
Yeah. But if so,

140
00:09:12.777 --> 00:09:14.877
why would it be the 4th grade homeroom teacher?

141
00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:17.477
True. It is quite strange.

142
00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:18.677
If it were them,

143
00:09:18.677 --> 00:09:21.677
they would probably come directly into class.

144
00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.877
But what bothers me

145
00:09:23.877 --> 00:09:26.477
is her suspicious actions these past few days.

146
00:09:26.477 --> 00:09:27.677
Yeah.

147
00:09:27.677 --> 00:09:31.877
She seems to have avoided her friends after school and walked home alone.

148
00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:36.577
Her friends say that she never told them the reason either.

149
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:41.077
Maybe she sensed some kind of danger.

150
00:09:41.077 --> 00:09:42.677
No way.

151
00:09:42.677 --> 00:09:45.877
If she did feel that someone was after her,

152
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:49.377
the more she would've stuck around her parents and friends.

153
00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:51.877
She would've gone to Kyushu, too.

154
00:09:51.877 --> 00:09:53.577
Yes. That's true.

155
00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:55.477
It would be a different story

156
00:09:55.477 --> 00:10:00.777
if she's the type that would keep all her worries to herself though.

157
00:10:00.777 --> 00:10:02.677
Like somebody I know.

158
00:10:02.677 --> 00:10:04.277
Talk for yourself.

159
00:10:04.277 --> 00:10:05.977
Haibara!

160
00:10:05.977 --> 00:10:07.877
Conan!

161
00:10:07.877 --> 00:10:10.277
This way, this way!

162
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:12.577
"Amemiya"

163
00:10:12.577 --> 00:10:16.277
This is Shoko Amemiya's house.

164
00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:20.277
There were no traces of an accident here either.

165
00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:22.477
I wonder where she went?

166
00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:26.777
Maybe she's playing hooky and playing TV games at home?

167
00:10:26.777 --> 00:10:29.277
She's alone at home today, right?

168
00:10:34.777 --> 00:10:36.277
No one seems to be home.

169
00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:40.977
I think we can get inside.

170
00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:44.577
I came here before,

171
00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.777
and saw where the key is hidden!

172
00:10:50.777 --> 00:10:52.677
I found it.

173
00:10:52.677 --> 00:10:54.677
I don't think we should...

174
00:10:54.677 --> 00:10:58.477
Yeah, we shouldn't go inside without permission.

175
00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:01.577
Please excuse me.

176
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.177
This is Mitsuhiko.

177
00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:05.777
I'm not a thief.

178
00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:08.077
Hello!

179
00:11:08.077 --> 00:11:11.377
Nobody home?

180
00:11:11.377 --> 00:11:12.777
I'm coming in.

181
00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:21.177
Is it the girl to the very right?

182
00:11:21.177 --> 00:11:22.577
Yes, that's right!

183
00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:23.877
True!

184
00:11:23.877 --> 00:11:26.977
She does look a little like Ai.

185
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:28.177
Talking about alike,

186
00:11:28.177 --> 00:11:31.677
I think there was one other thing she had in common with Haibara.

187
00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:35.777
Don't tell me that her voice resembled Haibara's, too?

188
00:11:35.777 --> 00:11:37.077
Oh, no.

189
00:11:37.077 --> 00:11:38.877
Her voice didn't sound like Haibara's,

190
00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:41.677
nor did she make sarcastic remarks.

191
00:11:41.677 --> 00:11:43.277
Well, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:49.977
Maybe she came home!

193
00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:01.877
Who are you all?

194
00:12:01.877 --> 00:12:04.577
Who are you?

195
00:12:04.577 --> 00:12:11.177
I'm Shoko Amemiya's teacher at Teitan Elementary School.

196
00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:12.577
My name is Bungo Hirayama.

197
00:12:12.577 --> 00:12:13.777
I see.

198
00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:15.177
You're her teacher.

199
00:12:15.177 --> 00:12:16.977
You scared us out of our wits!

200
00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:22.677
Huh? You have a wound by your right eye.

201
00:12:22.677 --> 00:12:25.677
Yeah, I fell off the stairs this morning.

202
00:12:26.777 --> 00:12:29.577
Your glasses are out of place.

203
00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:32.877
The hinges of these glasses are broken.

204
00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.477
I wonder if we can really rely on this teacher.

205
00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:38.477
By the way, who are you children?

206
00:12:38.477 --> 00:12:40.277
Do you live in this neighbourhood?

207
00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:45.277
We're students at Teitan Elementary where you teach!

208
00:12:45.277 --> 00:12:46.977
We're in 1st grade, Class B!

209
00:12:49.577 --> 00:12:51.777
But what are you all doing here?

210
00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:55.377
We're doing the same thing as you, Mr. Hirayama.

211
00:12:55.377 --> 00:12:58.577
We got worried about her and came to look for her.

212
00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:01.377
You know, Shoko Amemiya in 4th grade.

213
00:13:03.577 --> 00:13:06.277
I knew where the house key was,

214
00:13:06.277 --> 00:13:09.877
so we came inside on our own to confirm whether she was home.

215
00:13:09.877 --> 00:13:10.977
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:10.977 --> 00:13:13.377
But nobody's home.

217
00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:14.777
I see.

218
00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:17.577
Then maybe she went to Kyushu after all.

219
00:13:17.577 --> 00:13:22.377
Did Shoko say she was going to stay here alone today?

220
00:13:22.377 --> 00:13:23.677
Yeah.

221
00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:28.177
But she mentioned yesterday that she was going to eat breakfast and dinner

222
00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:29.977
at her neighbour, Mitsuike's house.

223
00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:31.877
Then I'm sure she's there!

224
00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:34.277
Okay, let's go then.

225
00:13:34.277 --> 00:13:35.277
Let's go!

226
00:13:35.277 --> 00:13:36.577
-Genta, wait. -Wait.

227
00:13:36.577 --> 00:13:37.677
To Mrs. Mitsuike's house.

228
00:13:56.224 --> 00:13:59.524
Shoko Amemiya didn't come?

229
00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:02.424
No, she's coming over tonight.

230
00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:04.524
I saw her heading off for school early this morning

231
00:14:04.524 --> 00:14:06.524
with her school bag on her back.

232
00:14:06.524 --> 00:14:08.024
It's an incident after all!

233
00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:09.524
What shall we do?

234
00:14:09.524 --> 00:14:11.624
Is something the matter with Shoko?

235
00:14:11.624 --> 00:14:15.224
Shoko Amemiya didn't come to school today.

236
00:14:16.724 --> 00:14:19.024
Didn't you get a call from school?

237
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.424
Well...

238
00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:23.524
I went out shopping with some women in this neighbourhood

239
00:14:23.524 --> 00:14:26.224
and just got home a while ago.

240
00:14:26.224 --> 00:14:30.524
Besides, my husband is at work so nobody was home.

241
00:14:30.524 --> 00:14:32.324
That's why I'm not sure if the school called or not.

242
00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:34.224
But it really bothers me.

243
00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:39.524
Shoko's family is in Kyushu to attend her grandfather's funeral.

244
00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:42.224
I wonder why only she decided to stay behind

245
00:14:42.224 --> 00:14:45.724
and have Mrs. Mitsuike take care of her.

246
00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:48.624
I'm not sure. I don't know why,

247
00:14:48.624 --> 00:14:52.224
but it seemed that she cried and begged her parents

248
00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.524
saying that she didn't want to go.

249
00:14:54.524 --> 00:14:56.424
Cried...

250
00:14:56.424 --> 00:14:58.124
When I saw her this morning,

251
00:14:58.124 --> 00:15:00.724
it looked like she didn't have much sleep, too.

252
00:15:00.724 --> 00:15:02.924
Maybe she got into a fight with her parents?

253
00:15:02.924 --> 00:15:05.924
Did you notice anything else then?

254
00:15:05.924 --> 00:15:07.924
Something aside from the usual.

255
00:15:07.924 --> 00:15:11.924
Well, I called out to her and said, "You're going out early today."

256
00:15:11.924 --> 00:15:15.724
Then she answered, "I'm going to the convenience store on the corner."

257
00:15:15.724 --> 00:15:17.324
Convenience store?

258
00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:20.424
She got into a fight with her parents and left home after all!

259
00:15:20.424 --> 00:15:21.624
I see.

260
00:15:21.624 --> 00:15:24.824
She wanted to get food at the convenience store!

261
00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:26.224
Oh, no.

262
00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:29.924
But she doesn't look like a student who would run away from home.

263
00:15:29.924 --> 00:15:31.524
Who are you?

264
00:15:31.524 --> 00:15:33.024
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:37.024
I'm Mr. Hirayama, Shoko Amemiya's homeroom teacher.

266
00:15:37.024 --> 00:15:39.624
Oh, the new teacher.

267
00:15:39.624 --> 00:15:41.524
Yes, I'm just substituting

268
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:45.124
until the teacher who got into a traffic accident recovers though.

269
00:15:45.124 --> 00:15:48.724
If 30 minutes go by and you get no contact from me,

270
00:15:48.724 --> 00:15:49.924
please call the police!

271
00:15:51.524 --> 00:15:53.524
I promise I'll find her!

272
00:15:55.424 --> 00:15:57.824
Who are you?

273
00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:59.124
Conan Edogawa.

274
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:02.224
We're the Youth Detective Squad...

275
00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:03.224
Here we go!

276
00:16:03.224 --> 00:16:04.424
Yeah...

277
00:16:07.524 --> 00:16:10.424
The elementary school student, Shoko Amemiya?

278
00:16:10.424 --> 00:16:11.724
I'm not sure.

279
00:16:11.724 --> 00:16:14.824
I just started working here as the manager just the other day,

280
00:16:14.824 --> 00:16:17.824
so I don't know the names and faces of the children in this neighbourhood.

281
00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:19.724
I can show you how she looks like.

282
00:16:21.124 --> 00:16:22.424
She looks like this!

283
00:16:26.524 --> 00:16:28.524
This girl came early in the morning!

284
00:16:28.524 --> 00:16:29.924
-Really? -Really?

285
00:16:29.924 --> 00:16:33.024
Mitsuhiko, when did you take a picture like that?

286
00:16:33.024 --> 00:16:35.624
When we went into her house a while ago.

287
00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:39.924
I took a picture at the front entrance with this cell phone!

288
00:16:39.924 --> 00:16:43.024
And? Do you remember what she bought?

289
00:16:43.024 --> 00:16:44.524
I think it was...

290
00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:47.324
A plastic bottle of fruit juice,

291
00:16:47.324 --> 00:16:49.424
a carton of milk,

292
00:16:49.424 --> 00:16:53.024
and a small carry around cutter knife.

293
00:16:53.024 --> 00:16:55.924
Juice, milk and a cutter knife?

294
00:16:55.924 --> 00:16:59.224
She'll get hungry buying only things to drink, won't she?

295
00:16:59.224 --> 00:17:01.924
I wonder if she was planning to make something at school

296
00:17:01.924 --> 00:17:05.424
because she also bought a cutter knife?

297
00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:08.924
Well, now we know that she wasn't planning to run away from home.

298
00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:11.924
Anything else that bothered you about her?

299
00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:15.124
Well, come to think of it,

300
00:17:15.124 --> 00:17:20.124
she was at the kitchen goods corner for a while.

301
00:17:20.124 --> 00:17:22.924
I asked her, "Are you looking for something?"

302
00:17:22.924 --> 00:17:26.324
But she didn't say anything and left to go to another corner.

303
00:17:30.524 --> 00:17:33.424
What was she going to buy?

304
00:17:33.424 --> 00:17:35.524
Maybe toothpicks?

305
00:17:35.524 --> 00:17:39.224
Dad always tells me to go buy some.

306
00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:42.724
It's not something you buy before going to school!

307
00:17:42.724 --> 00:17:46.124
I mean she's not going to school with a toothpick in her mouth, right?

308
00:17:46.124 --> 00:17:50.024
If it's about that girl, I told those children about her a while ago.

309
00:17:50.024 --> 00:17:51.624
I see.

310
00:17:51.624 --> 00:17:55.124
We'd better be careful of that teacher.

311
00:17:56.224 --> 00:18:00.124
He's acting like he's a nice man in front of us,

312
00:18:00.124 --> 00:18:02.224
but the instant we walked away,

313
00:18:02.224 --> 00:18:04.724
he was glaring with a dreadful look on his face.

314
00:18:04.724 --> 00:18:06.924
Yeah. I guess so.

315
00:18:06.924 --> 00:18:09.024
What do you mean, "I guess so"?

316
00:18:09.024 --> 00:18:12.724
Either way, our top priority now is to look for the girl called Shoko!

317
00:18:15.024 --> 00:18:16.224
Oh, my!

318
00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:17.424
It's you guys!

319
00:18:18.824 --> 00:18:20.324
Officer Yumi!

320
00:18:20.324 --> 00:18:22.524
The lady that rides the mini police motorbike!

321
00:18:22.524 --> 00:18:24.824
What are you all doing here?

322
00:18:24.824 --> 00:18:27.124
Your house is way on the other side, right?

323
00:18:29.624 --> 00:18:31.224
I see.

324
00:18:31.224 --> 00:18:35.224
Before Shoko Amemiya's whereabouts became unknown,

325
00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:39.124
the last place she stopped over at was this convenience store.

326
00:18:39.124 --> 00:18:43.124
Yep. Did you get any reports at the police

327
00:18:43.124 --> 00:18:47.124
of suspicious people or a traffic accident?

328
00:18:47.124 --> 00:18:49.624
We didn't get even one today yet.

329
00:18:49.624 --> 00:18:52.524
But we did get a load of reports of illegal parking.

330
00:18:52.524 --> 00:18:54.124
What's illegal parking?

331
00:18:54.124 --> 00:18:55.724
People parking their cars and motorbikes

332
00:18:55.724 --> 00:18:57.724
in places they're not supposed to park.

333
00:18:57.724 --> 00:18:59.424
It's a bad thing to do!

334
00:18:59.424 --> 00:19:02.024
I'm on my way to check on illegal parking.

335
00:19:02.024 --> 00:19:04.924
Then why did you stop over at this convenience store?

336
00:19:04.924 --> 00:19:06.624
Did you get hungry?

337
00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:07.924
No!

338
00:19:10.324 --> 00:19:12.224
I came to buy a mask!

339
00:19:12.224 --> 00:19:14.024
Do you have a cold, Officer Yumi?

340
00:19:15.124 --> 00:19:17.924
I have to go to three place now,

341
00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:20.324
but all three places require me to wear masks.

342
00:19:20.324 --> 00:19:22.924
Does it smell terrible or something?

343
00:19:22.924 --> 00:19:24.624
Yes, in two of the places.

344
00:19:24.624 --> 00:19:27.124
They're near a trash dump.

345
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.324
There are people who threw their garbage

346
00:19:28.324 --> 00:19:30.524
regardless of what day of the week it is

347
00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:33.424
and it's become a feeding place for crows.

348
00:19:33.424 --> 00:19:35.424
The smell of the garbage

349
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:38.224
that the crows have scavenged is so stink and smelly

350
00:19:38.224 --> 00:19:41.424
that it's probably better to give a ticket for illegal disposing of trash

351
00:19:41.424 --> 00:19:42.924
before issuing a ticket for illegal parking.

352
00:19:42.924 --> 00:19:44.724
What about the other two places?

353
00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:47.124
The second place is a warehouse,

354
00:19:47.124 --> 00:19:49.524
and I don't know if it's the dust or what,

355
00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:52.224
but every time I go there I can't stop sneezing.

356
00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:55.924
I went there yesterday too, but ended up with a runny nose.

357
00:19:55.924 --> 00:19:58.924
When I went there before I was just fine though.

358
00:19:58.924 --> 00:20:00.324
And the other place?

359
00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:05.424
It's near the house where my ex-boyfriend in my university days lives.

360
00:20:05.424 --> 00:20:07.124
I really don't want to see him

361
00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:08.924
because I sort of brushed him off in a ruthless way.

362
00:20:08.924 --> 00:20:10.824
You're going to cover your face with the mask?

363
00:20:10.824 --> 00:20:13.524
Was he such a bad person?

364
00:20:13.524 --> 00:20:16.824
No, he was pretty handsome,

365
00:20:16.824 --> 00:20:19.424
but too childish.

366
00:20:20.424 --> 00:20:24.124
Who cares about my ex-boyfriend at a time like this?

367
00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:27.124
You're the one who started talking about him.

368
00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:32.124
Well, those three places have Pachinko parlours and game centres nearby,

369
00:20:32.124 --> 00:20:35.524
so many customers who could not park their cars and motorbikes

370
00:20:35.524 --> 00:20:37.724
in the parking lot park their vehicles on the street!

371
00:20:37.724 --> 00:20:39.224
Do you guys understand?

372
00:20:39.224 --> 00:20:40.424
Yes...

373
00:20:40.424 --> 00:20:42.724
The problem for now

374
00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:45.124
is the girl whose whereabouts is unknown.

375
00:20:45.124 --> 00:20:49.624
Will you please contact the police department and check one more time

376
00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:52.324
whether there was an accident or something like that.

377
00:20:52.324 --> 00:20:53.324
Okay.

378
00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:06.024
There are no traffic accidents in this vicinity here after all.

379
00:21:06.024 --> 00:21:08.724
Then I wonder where she went.

380
00:21:08.724 --> 00:21:10.424
Ai, do you have any idea?

381
00:21:11.724 --> 00:21:17.324
If she was like you, maybe you can tell where she went.

382
00:21:17.324 --> 00:21:18.624
I wonder...

383
00:21:18.624 --> 00:21:21.224
Come to think of it, Mitsuhiko you said

384
00:21:21.224 --> 00:21:25.024
that the girl and Haibara had one more thing in common?

385
00:21:25.024 --> 00:21:29.824
I'm trying to remember really hard what it was too, but...

386
00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:32.124
You're eating at a time like this?

387
00:21:33.224 --> 00:21:34.724
What's the big deal?

388
00:21:34.724 --> 00:21:37.224
I used my head, so I got hungry.

389
00:21:42.024 --> 00:21:43.724
Oh, that's right.

390
00:21:45.224 --> 00:21:47.424
Come to think of it, that girl went outside the store

391
00:21:47.424 --> 00:21:50.324
and drank the fruit juice that she bought on the spot.

392
00:21:50.324 --> 00:21:51.924
She swallowed it down in a gulp.

393
00:21:53.724 --> 00:21:56.624
She must've been really thirsty.

394
00:21:56.624 --> 00:21:58.924
But the store's near her house.

395
00:21:58.924 --> 00:22:04.624
She bought fruit juice in a PET bottle, a milk carton and a cutter knife.

396
00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:08.824
She then stops over at the kitchen goods corner.

397
00:22:10.324 --> 00:22:12.524
Her personality resembles Haibara.

398
00:22:16.024 --> 00:22:17.724
Maybe...

399
00:23:44.824 --> 00:23:46.324
"Next Episode"

400
00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:47.724
-Conan? -Conan?

401
00:23:52.724 --> 00:23:54.224
Just as I thought.

402
00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:58.024
Hey, are you sure she's in a place like this?

403
00:24:04.924 --> 00:24:08.724
Could it be that Shoko was run over by a car?

404
00:24:08.724 --> 00:24:14.824
Next Conan, "Super Secret School Zone (Part 2)"

405
00:24:15.609 --> 00:24:17.609
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:19.809
"Predisposed to allergy"

407
00:24:22.209 --> 00:24:24.509
What kind of allergy do you have, Genta?
