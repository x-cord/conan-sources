is now commencing with boarding procedures.

3
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:12,638
What are you about to start,

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:13,941
Mr. Thief?

5
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:15,375
Let's see...

6
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:19,243

Hidden in there

10
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:29,787
was the mystery behind the star sapphire

11
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:32,352
and Kid's true motive.

13
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:33,698
And then...

14
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:40,417
A locked-room murder suddenly took place
in the flight we're on!

15
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,032
Kid might have blended in

16
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,854
among all these passengers.

17
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,155
The culprit is you!

00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:57,334
It's going to crash!

21
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:58,537
This is an emergency!

22
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,501
Do you copy?

23
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,954
Is this also Kid's doing?

24
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:03,960
Or is it...

25
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:09,113
We need to solve

26
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:11,451
this suspenseful locked-room murder
10,000 feet up in the air!

27
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:17,530
Absolute despair!

28
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:19,041
Is this our fate?
