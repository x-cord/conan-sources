1
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.440
"Murderer Shinichi Kudo"

2
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040
Hey, are you all right, Conan?

3
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.840
I'm fine.

4
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.240
I drank the cold medicine that Dr. Agasa gave me.

5
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.440
But, your voice sounds terrible.

6
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.540
I think it's better we head back

7
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.140
and I take care of you at home.

8
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140
He'll be just fine.

9
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.240
That wonder drug that was given to the brat a while ago,

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.240
will soon cure him.

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240
What wonder drug?

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.840
Hey, don't tell me it's that Chinese liquor called Baikaru

13
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
that you brought with you

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.440
when you first visited my detective agency?

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440
No, no.

16
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.440
It's medicine that's way more effective than liquor.

17
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.940
Right, boy?

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.740
I wonder if the person

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.440
that we're going to see is really okay.

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.340
"Mr. Heiji Hattori" -Because it said in the letter

21
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.040
that he wanted to talk to Shinichi.

22
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.840
Isn't the person going to be disappointed

23
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.540
if he finds that Shinichi's not with us?

24
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.540
Really?

25
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.940
Yes, something about that person

26
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.040
finding that Shinichi made a mistake in deducing

27
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.040
a murder case that he solved a year ago.

28
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.540
So the person wants to meet him and talk about it.

29
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.940
That's why, in consideration of that mistake in deduction,

30
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.740
we're going to reinvestigate the case and reveal the truth.

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.440
Well, I mailed Shinichi.

32
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.340
So he just might decide to show up.

33
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.640
Shinichi might come?

34
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.640
But, why would the guy send the letter to you?

35
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.740
Of course because I'm Shinichi's best friend.

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.240
Well, even if he did try to contact me by mail or phone,

37
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.440
I'm not living here now anyway.

38
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.740
So, he probably got impatient

39
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.940
and decided send mail to high school detective Heiji Hattori,

40
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.840
since he's in the same profession.

41
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.640
But, what's this about a mistake in deduction?

42
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.740
If I'm not mistaken the sender was...

43
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.940
It's a letter from a man called Makoto Okuda

44
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.240
who lives in a place called East Okuho Village

45
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840
on the outskirts of Okuho-cho.

46
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
You know him, don't you?

47
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.740
Yes. I think it's the young man who helped us

48
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.240
when we investigated the murder case

49
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.140
that occurred in that village.

50
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.040
Do you have a cold?

51
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.040
Well, I'll take the letter that's addressed to you

52
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.540
that's enclosed together with mine when I go over,

53
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.540
so read it well, okay?

54
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.240
"Shinichi Kudo" -I'll bet it's filled with foul remarks

55
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.040
about your deduction,

56
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.440
but it'll be great stimulus to get rid of that cold of yours.

57
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.440
The only case I can recall

58
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.540
that occurred in East Okuho Village is...

59
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.140
A mistake in deduction?

60
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.840
It sure bugs me.

61
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.940
A crisis is gracefully revived.

62
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

63
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.140
Shinichi loses his memory and is not himself.

64
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.240
He cannot deduce the case together with Heiji.

65
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

66
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

67
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

68
00:04:57.037 --> 00:05:02.237
"Murderer Shinichi Kudo"

69
00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.437
What? His whereabouts is unknown?

70
00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:07.637
Are you serious?

71
00:05:07.637 --> 00:05:08.737
"Residents Division" -Yes.

72
00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:11.937
A missing persons search was out for him six months ago.

73
00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:15.537
Well, Makoto always wanted to go to the city anyway.

74
00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:16.537
"Makoto Okuda (19)" -The villagers say

75
00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:19.337
that he probably left home for the city

76
00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:21.937
and is part-timing or something there.

77
00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:25.437
And? What do you want with Makoto Okuda?

78
00:05:25.437 --> 00:05:28.337
I got a letter from him last week.

79
00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:30.037
It said that he wants to talk

80
00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:31.637
about the deduction mistake that was made by Shinichi Kudo

81
00:05:31.637 --> 00:05:33.537
when he solved a murder case

82
00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:35.937
that occurred in this village a year ago.

83
00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:37.837
Who?

84
00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.037
He asked me to bring Shinichi Kudo.

85
00:05:46.537 --> 00:05:47.937
What this?

86
00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:50.137
Liar!

87
00:05:51.137 --> 00:05:54.337
You're friends of that liar, right?

88
00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:55.537
Liar?

89
00:05:55.537 --> 00:05:57.337
Hey, Sonny.

90
00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:59.337
At any rate,

91
00:05:59.337 --> 00:06:02.337
if you want to know about the case, go to the village police box.

92
00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:05.537
We have nothing to tell you people.

93
00:06:07.537 --> 00:06:10.437
What the heck did that high school brat detective do anyway?

94
00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:13.437
Ran, haven't you heard anything from Shinichi?

95
00:06:13.437 --> 00:06:14.437
No.

96
00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:17.337
Where's Conan?

97
00:06:17.337 --> 00:06:20.737
That brat said that he'd head off for the inn ahead of us.

98
00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:23.137
I guess his cold got worse.

99
00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:25.637
I'm going back to the inn too then.

100
00:06:25.637 --> 00:06:27.737
I don't want to leave him there alone.

101
00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:29.837
Well, I guess the truth is he didn't want to go there

102
00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:33.837
and have to face me pointing out his deduction mistake.

103
00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:38.437
Dear Mr. Shinichi Kudo,

104
00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:42.237
I've found evidence that there was a mistake in your deduction.

105
00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:45.537
I suggest that we should talk things out just the two of us,

106
00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:47.437
so you can save face as a detective.

107
00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:49.437
I'd like to see you at the mountain hut

108
00:06:49.437 --> 00:06:51.137
where we both first ran into each other.

109
00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:52.637
Makoto Okuda.

110
00:06:59.237 --> 00:07:01.937
Excuse me.

111
00:07:04.037 --> 00:07:06.137
The cold medicine that doctor got me

112
00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:08.537
isn't making me feel better at all.

113
00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:12.437
Are you Shinichi Kudo?

114
00:07:14.137 --> 00:07:15.737
His voice is changed.

115
00:07:15.737 --> 00:07:16.837
Who is it?

116
00:07:22.437 --> 00:07:23.937
The door is locked.

117
00:07:23.937 --> 00:07:27.237
Hey, wait! Hey!

118
00:07:27.237 --> 00:07:28.637
Darn, my throat...

119
00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:31.137
I've lost my voice because of this cold.

120
00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:33.837
The window...

121
00:07:35.337 --> 00:07:36.537
and door as well...

122
00:07:39.037 --> 00:07:40.837
I've got to find an escape route.

123
00:07:44.737 --> 00:07:46.437
This thing I'm feeling...

124
00:07:46.437 --> 00:07:47.537
It can't be...

125
00:07:49.137 --> 00:07:52.137
Doctor, did you see the bottle of medicine

126
00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:54.237
that I had way inside the drawer?

127
00:07:54.237 --> 00:07:57.537
You mean that cold medicine.

128
00:07:57.537 --> 00:07:59.637
The container was that of cold medicine,

129
00:07:59.637 --> 00:08:01.637
but the content is the medicine that I made.

130
00:08:01.637 --> 00:08:02.637
What?

131
00:08:02.637 --> 00:08:05.237
Don't tell me you drank it?

132
00:08:05.237 --> 00:08:07.437
No. Well...

133
00:08:12.537 --> 00:08:14.437
Bummers.

134
00:08:14.437 --> 00:08:17.037
I've got to get out of here fast.

135
00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:21.937
What? It was a prototype anecdote for APTX 4869?

136
00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:25.737
Yes, that's right.

137
00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.837
I made it thinking to secretly try it on him

138
00:08:27.837 --> 00:08:30.537
when he comes to spend the night here next time.

139
00:08:30.537 --> 00:08:31.737
That medicine was the miracle drug

140
00:08:31.737 --> 00:08:34.037
that could maybe change his body that had become that of a child

141
00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:37.237
to the body of a high school student that it used to be.

142
00:08:37.237 --> 00:08:39.337
You've got to call him quick.

143
00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:41.937
If he transforms into his original body in front of everyone,

144
00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:43.437
we can't afford that to happen.

145
00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:08.337
Conan is not back at the inn yet?

146
00:09:08.337 --> 00:09:10.937
No. I asked a villager

147
00:09:10.937 --> 00:09:12.237
and was told that he saw a boy wearing glasses

148
00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:15.437
go into the forest alone.

149
00:09:15.437 --> 00:09:18.537
Then, why don't you call him on his cell phone?

150
00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:19.637
"Out of service"

151
00:09:19.637 --> 00:09:20.837
No good.

152
00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:22.837
This place is out of service range.

153
00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:24.937
What the heck is he doing?

154
00:09:24.937 --> 00:09:27.337
And Conan has a cold too.

155
00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:29.937
That troublemaker.

156
00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:31.537
Sorry, officer.

157
00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:34.137
We'll go to the site of the murder later.

158
00:09:34.137 --> 00:09:36.737
Okay, see you later then.

159
00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:43.837
Conan!

160
00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:45.837
Where are you?

161
00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:48.337
Come on out!

162
00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:49.637
Don't tell me that he...

163
00:09:49.637 --> 00:09:52.137
that something was written on that letter addressed to him,

164
00:09:52.137 --> 00:09:54.937
and he was summoned to go to some strange place?

165
00:09:54.937 --> 00:09:57.037
Hey, did you hear about it?

166
00:09:57.037 --> 00:09:58.137
What's up?

167
00:09:58.137 --> 00:10:01.237
A stark naked man was afloat in the lake.

168
00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:02.937
Yes. I heard.

169
00:10:02.937 --> 00:10:05.837
My mom just took a blanket over.

170
00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.437
Hey.

171
00:10:07.437 --> 00:10:09.737
It wasn't an elementary school kid, was it?

172
00:10:09.737 --> 00:10:11.037
No.

173
00:10:11.037 --> 00:10:12.237
It was a young man,

174
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.937
probably a high school student or something.

175
00:10:13.937 --> 00:10:16.237
-High... -High school student?

176
00:10:21.437 --> 00:10:22.737
Over there, over there.

177
00:10:22.737 --> 00:10:25.137
It's that man wrapped in a blanket.

178
00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:44.637
Shinichi?

179
00:10:44.637 --> 00:10:45.937
Shinichi!

180
00:10:48.437 --> 00:10:50.937
Why? Why are you here, Shinichi?

181
00:10:52.837 --> 00:10:54.637
Shinichi...

182
00:10:55.837 --> 00:10:59.337
Is that my name?

183
00:10:59.337 --> 00:11:00.837
Shinichi?

184
00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.378
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

185
00:11:21.378 --> 00:11:25.178
You're the high school detective of the East, Shinichi Kudo.

186
00:11:25.178 --> 00:11:28.478
Talking funny like that isn't making anybody laugh.

187
00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:29.878
Detective?

188
00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:32.878
Don't tell me that Shinichi...

189
00:11:32.878 --> 00:11:34.878
Lost his memory?

190
00:11:34.878 --> 00:11:36.878
I don't know

191
00:11:36.878 --> 00:11:40.878
who I am or where I am.

192
00:11:45.378 --> 00:11:47.878
Shinichi?

193
00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:52.078
Hey, isn't this the guy, Shinichi Kudo?

194
00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:54.678
If so, we shouldn't have rescued him.

195
00:11:54.678 --> 00:11:56.478
Hey, watch your mouth.

196
00:11:56.478 --> 00:11:59.978
Could you lend me something to wear?

197
00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:02.578
I don't seem to have any clothes on.

198
00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:05.678
Okay. I'll lend you my clothes.

199
00:12:05.678 --> 00:12:08.278
Talk about a voice hoarse from a cold.

200
00:12:08.278 --> 00:12:10.878
Just like Conan.

201
00:12:10.878 --> 00:12:13.878
That's right, we've got to find Conan quick.

202
00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:16.378
No, I don't think we need to worry about him.

203
00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:23.478
Well, the thing is...

204
00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:26.278
What?

205
00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:28.678
He took the train and left for home?

206
00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:30.278
All by himself?

207
00:12:30.278 --> 00:12:31.278
Yes.

208
00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:32.678
I'd completely forgotten that he told me so

209
00:12:32.678 --> 00:12:36.578
before we went to the town office.

210
00:12:36.578 --> 00:12:38.078
He said he didn't want his cold to get worse,

211
00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:40.078
so he wanted to go on home.

212
00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:44.178
But, there's nobody back at the office.

213
00:12:44.178 --> 00:12:45.478
I'm sure that he told me

214
00:12:45.478 --> 00:12:47.878
that he was going to stay over at old man Agasa's place

215
00:12:47.878 --> 00:12:49.278
or something.

216
00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:51.978
What's your problem talking like that?

217
00:12:51.978 --> 00:12:55.278
I said I just simply forgot.

218
00:12:56.778 --> 00:13:00.078
At any rate, this place is out of service range,

219
00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:02.678
so if we want to check on the whereabouts of that brat,

220
00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:05.678
we've got to go back to the inn where there's a phone.

221
00:13:05.678 --> 00:13:07.578
We're taking this troublesome detective brat

222
00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.578
that forgot everything with us too.

223
00:13:11.978 --> 00:13:14.578
Forget about trying to put sense back into him.

224
00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:17.478
I'm sure he met the you know what in the forest.

225
00:13:18.478 --> 00:13:21.078
-You know what of the forest? -What a scare, scare...

226
00:13:21.078 --> 00:13:23.278
Hey, hold it you!

227
00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:26.378
What do you know about the forest?

228
00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:50.678
You look pretty good in Heiji's clothes.

229
00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:53.078
Don't you think so, Ran?

230
00:13:53.078 --> 00:13:54.278
Where's Ran?

231
00:13:54.278 --> 00:13:57.378
It seems that Ran's more worried about the glasses brat

232
00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:00.778
than that high school detective.

233
00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:04.078
What? You gave me the wrong medicine?

234
00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.878
Don't tell me you gave me the medicine

235
00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:09.678
that the little lady made at the school festival?

236
00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:11.878
Yes, that's right.

237
00:14:11.878 --> 00:14:14.478
It's the antidote for APTX 4869

238
00:14:14.478 --> 00:14:17.178
that shrunk Shinichi's body.

239
00:14:17.178 --> 00:14:18.878
In other words, it's a drug that will return his body

240
00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:20.978
to that of a high school student that he originally was.

241
00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:24.678
I mistook that drug that Ai made for cold medicine

242
00:14:24.678 --> 00:14:27.278
and carelessly gave it to you.

243
00:14:27.278 --> 00:14:29.078
I mean gramps, careless is not the word for it.

244
00:14:29.078 --> 00:14:30.078
By the way,

245
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:33.078
is it true that Shinichi has lost his memory?

246
00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:36.078
Yes, it seems he doesn't remember anything.

247
00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:39.878
Well, I guess it's better for him that way, though.

248
00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.478
I mean with his original body from here on now,

249
00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:44.978
it'll be more convenient for him and all I guess.

250
00:14:44.978 --> 00:14:46.678
Stupid.

251
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.978
That drug is only a prototype.

252
00:14:48.978 --> 00:14:50.978
There may be a slight discrepancy

253
00:14:50.978 --> 00:14:54.578
but the longest the effect will continue is more or less 24 hours.

254
00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:55.978
Twenty four hours?

255
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.878
You've got to make sure he regains his memory by then

256
00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.278
or else we're in big trouble.

257
00:15:00.278 --> 00:15:01.978
Why? If it's his memory,

258
00:15:01.978 --> 00:15:04.778
we can work on it slowly after he becomes small again.

259
00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:07.278
What are you saying?

260
00:15:07.278 --> 00:15:09.878
If two people get amnesia at the same time,

261
00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:12.278
no matter how dense, it'll be more than obvious

262
00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.578
that the two are one and the same.

263
00:15:14.578 --> 00:15:16.578
Especially her.

264
00:15:16.578 --> 00:15:17.678
True.

265
00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:18.878
If that should happen,

266
00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:21.578
I'm sure she'll find out

267
00:15:21.578 --> 00:15:26.178
what's going on no matter what.

268
00:15:26.178 --> 00:15:28.178
About who made him drink the drug and for what.

269
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.678
I wonder if she'd be able to hold the truth

270
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:33.078
that she finds out about all within herself?

271
00:15:33.078 --> 00:15:35.378
Well, in order not to corner her

272
00:15:35.378 --> 00:15:38.778
into a dangerous predicament like we're in,

273
00:15:38.778 --> 00:15:41.078
will you please bring him back here

274
00:15:41.078 --> 00:15:43.378
before he turns back into a child again?

275
00:15:43.378 --> 00:15:45.978
I'll take care of everything else here.

276
00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:47.878
Okay, you can count on me.

277
00:15:47.878 --> 00:15:51.678
Heiji, what's all the whispering about?

278
00:15:51.678 --> 00:15:53.178
Please put me on the phone.

279
00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:55.178
They hung up.

280
00:15:55.178 --> 00:15:56.578
What?

281
00:15:56.578 --> 00:15:59.678
Well, I was told that he drank medicine

282
00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:01.678
and is fast asleep so not to worry.

283
00:16:01.678 --> 00:16:03.378
Okay.

284
00:16:03.378 --> 00:16:06.478
Okay then, let's eat dinner too and hit the sack right away.

285
00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:09.178
After all, we've got to back to Beika-cho tomorrow.

286
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.778
I thought we were going to take it easy

287
00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:13.178
and stay for 2 nights and three days?

288
00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:14.678
The schedules been changed.

289
00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:17.578
We've got to get Kudo to a doctor as soon as possible, right?

290
00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:22.478
Let's take Shinichi to that murder site too then.

291
00:16:22.478 --> 00:16:24.778
He may just remember something.

292
00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:26.778
What the heck are you talking about?

293
00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:28.978
Wait.

294
00:16:28.978 --> 00:16:30.778
Maybe she's got a point there.

295
00:16:46.164 --> 00:16:48.264
My god, what a mess!

296
00:16:48.264 --> 00:16:50.764
The entire house is messed up.

297
00:16:50.764 --> 00:16:52.864
"Officer Shiroyama (46)" -The room was left as is, since the incident,

298
00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:55.664
in keeping with his wishes.

299
00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:56.864
His?

300
00:16:56.864 --> 00:16:58.664
Daiki who was staying over at a relative's house

301
00:16:58.664 --> 00:17:04.064
and escaped disaster on the night of the incident a year ago.

302
00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:06.964
He's the brat that we ran into at the town office.

303
00:17:06.964 --> 00:17:10.164
Then, the two people who are in the picture on both sides of him are...

304
00:17:10.164 --> 00:17:14.564
Daiki's parents who died because of that incident.

305
00:17:14.564 --> 00:17:18.964
He's Mr. Takinori Hinohara, who was the village head back then

306
00:17:18.964 --> 00:17:22.164
and his wife, Shoko.

307
00:17:22.164 --> 00:17:24.764
Mr. Hinohara was a very cheerful person

308
00:17:24.764 --> 00:17:27.164
"East Okuho Village Office" -and was liked by all the villagers.

309
00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:31.664
He served as village head for more or less 20 years or so.

310
00:17:31.664 --> 00:17:34.664
Therefore, that disaster that struck a year ago

311
00:17:34.664 --> 00:17:37.664
really broke the hearts of the villagers.

312
00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:40.364
And this is the aftermath of the incident?

313
00:17:40.364 --> 00:17:42.464
These black footprints.

314
00:17:42.464 --> 00:17:44.464
Yes. This is...

315
00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:47.164
the blood of Mrs. Hinohara who was stabbed part way down the stairs

316
00:17:47.164 --> 00:17:48.664
and stepped on by the murderer

317
00:17:48.664 --> 00:17:50.464
which after he seems to have walked around the room

318
00:17:50.464 --> 00:17:53.564
with his shoes on, leaving footprints behind.

319
00:17:53.564 --> 00:17:55.264
How terrible.

320
00:17:55.264 --> 00:17:59.164
These shoe prints continue on quite a long way

321
00:17:59.164 --> 00:18:01.164
over to that veranda.

322
00:18:04.964 --> 00:18:07.564
It sure is a spacious veranda.

323
00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:12.264
The shoe prints return back from here.

324
00:18:16.364 --> 00:18:17.764
I see.

325
00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:22.264
So, the village head was made to fall over from here.

326
00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:23.564
And? What about the murder weapon,

327
00:18:23.564 --> 00:18:25.464
or was anything taken?

328
00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:28.764
The knife that was the murder weapon wasn't found in the house,

329
00:18:28.764 --> 00:18:32.264
but the jewelry and antiques were gone.

330
00:18:32.264 --> 00:18:35.864
The only thing left behind were the bloody shoe prints.

331
00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.564
The same shoe prints were found going from the back door

332
00:18:38.564 --> 00:18:43.164
to the asphalt outside and then back.

333
00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:46.364
Are you sure that those were the only shoe prints?

334
00:18:46.364 --> 00:18:47.364
Yes.

335
00:18:47.364 --> 00:18:50.464
It was raining until the day before the incident

336
00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:52.864
and the ground was muddy, you see.

337
00:18:52.864 --> 00:18:56.664
Which means that the armed robber after killing Mr. and Mrs. Hinohara,

338
00:18:56.664 --> 00:19:00.764
made off with the jewel and valuables in the house

339
00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:03.864
and fled by car.

340
00:19:03.864 --> 00:19:06.964
And? Who did Kudo say the murderer was?

341
00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:10.364
Don't tell me that he branded an innocent citizen

342
00:19:10.364 --> 00:19:12.864
to be the armed robber.

343
00:19:12.864 --> 00:19:14.864
No, well the thing is...

344
00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:18.064
Double suicide.

345
00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:22.864
Shinichi Kudo there deduced this case to be

346
00:19:22.864 --> 00:19:27.064
a forced double suicide that Mr. Hinohara committed.

347
00:19:27.064 --> 00:19:28.964
Forced double suicide?

348
00:19:31.764 --> 00:19:34.364
By the way, who are you, young lady?

349
00:19:34.364 --> 00:19:35.764
I'm the classmate of Makoto

350
00:19:35.764 --> 00:19:39.364
who was staying over at this house after his parents passed away.

351
00:19:39.364 --> 00:19:42.564
See, he's in that picture over there too,

352
00:19:42.564 --> 00:19:44.264
behind the village head.

353
00:19:45.264 --> 00:19:46.864
Hold it.

354
00:19:46.864 --> 00:19:49.464
Makoto, you mean Makoto Okuda?

355
00:19:49.464 --> 00:19:51.064
"Moegi Hikawa (19)" -Yes, that's right.

356
00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:52.964
He, Makoto Okuda, discovered the corpses

357
00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:55.964
and was the first to be suspected of being the murderer.

358
00:19:55.964 --> 00:19:57.964
Well, on the day the murder was committed,

359
00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.264
Makoto was staying over at a hotel in the city

360
00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.964
to take the entrance exam for a university,

361
00:20:01.964 --> 00:20:04.464
so he was cleared immediately.

362
00:20:04.464 --> 00:20:05.964
And let me ask you,

363
00:20:05.964 --> 00:20:08.164
where's that Makoto now?

364
00:20:09.264 --> 00:20:11.064
He's the one who sent a letter asking for me to bring Kudo here

365
00:20:11.064 --> 00:20:14.864
because he found that Kudo had made a mistake in deduction.

366
00:20:14.864 --> 00:20:16.064
Yet his whereabouts are unknown?

367
00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:17.364
What the heck is going on?

368
00:20:17.364 --> 00:20:19.564
His whereabouts are not unknown.

369
00:20:21.164 --> 00:20:24.764
He's probably been killed.

370
00:20:24.764 --> 00:20:26.064
What?

371
00:20:26.064 --> 00:20:27.464
Just what do you mean?

372
00:20:27.464 --> 00:20:31.564
The people of this village say that Makoto is part-timing in the city,

373
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.464
but since he was adopted by this family,

374
00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:35.764
he probably inherited a huge.

375
00:20:35.764 --> 00:20:39.964
So, you're saying that somebody who wanted to take that money from him.

376
00:20:39.964 --> 00:20:41.564
Yes. It's unthinkable

377
00:20:41.564 --> 00:20:46.364
that Makoto would not get in touch with anyone for half a year.

378
00:20:46.364 --> 00:20:49.764
Besides, the one who killed him

379
00:20:49.764 --> 00:20:51.464
is probably that thing in the forest.

380
00:20:51.464 --> 00:20:52.864
That thing in the forest?

381
00:20:54.664 --> 00:20:59.564
If so, who for what reason sent me a letter like that?

382
00:20:59.564 --> 00:21:03.064
What the heck is Kudo's deduction blooper?

383
00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:06.364
The motive for Mr. Hinohara committing forced double suicide

384
00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:08.564
was because his doctor declared that he had cancer

385
00:21:08.564 --> 00:21:10.864
and he was full of despair.

386
00:21:10.864 --> 00:21:12.064
The problem arose

387
00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:16.364
when Mr. Kudo publicized the truth a year ago.

388
00:21:16.364 --> 00:21:17.564
Who are you?

389
00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:19.564
"Misato Kawauchi (36)" -I'm a reporter for Tohto News,

390
00:21:19.564 --> 00:21:21.064
Misato Kawauchi.

391
00:21:21.064 --> 00:21:22.464
I'm sorry,

392
00:21:22.464 --> 00:21:25.364
I helped myself in because the door wasn't locked.

393
00:21:25.364 --> 00:21:27.864
And? So, what was the problem?

394
00:21:27.864 --> 00:21:28.864
Some days later,

395
00:21:28.864 --> 00:21:31.964
a nurse at the hospital let it out with a slip of her tongue.

396
00:21:31.964 --> 00:21:34.864
She told him that although he did have cancer, the tumor was benign

397
00:21:34.864 --> 00:21:37.164
and it would be completely cured with surgery.

398
00:21:37.164 --> 00:21:39.664
Hearing this, the he seemed very happy.

399
00:21:39.664 --> 00:21:40.964
What?

400
00:21:42.364 --> 00:21:44.564
Hey, Kudo. What the heck is going on?

401
00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:45.564
Explain.

402
00:21:45.564 --> 00:21:47.264
Kudo.

403
00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.264
I don't know... I don't know anything.

404
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:52.464
I don't know what's going on.

405
00:21:52.464 --> 00:21:53.764
Kudo.

406
00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:01.364
I see.

407
00:22:01.364 --> 00:22:03.164
I finally got it.

408
00:22:03.164 --> 00:22:07.464
I understand now why the villagers don't like this detective kid.

409
00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:08.564
Yes.

410
00:22:08.564 --> 00:22:10.864
He's a horrendous villain who disgraced the village head

411
00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:13.964
who was loved by everyone.

412
00:22:13.964 --> 00:22:15.364
But, how frightening.

413
00:22:15.364 --> 00:22:16.764
If that's true it means that the murderer

414
00:22:16.764 --> 00:22:19.964
is still out there somewhere, right?

415
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:21.964
There's a rumor going around among the villagers

416
00:22:21.964 --> 00:22:25.864
saying it's that you know who in the forest that's done it.

417
00:22:25.864 --> 00:22:28.064
Hey, I heard that just a while ago.

418
00:22:28.064 --> 00:22:29.264
But what the heck is it about?

419
00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:31.164
Is there something in the forest?

420
00:22:31.164 --> 00:22:34.564
It's folklore that's been relayed for generations in this village.

421
00:22:34.564 --> 00:22:36.064
Folklore?

422
00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:37.464
I remember frequently being told the folklore

423
00:22:37.464 --> 00:22:39.164
when I was a child too.

424
00:22:39.164 --> 00:22:41.464
I was told not to look at its eyes if I run into in the forest.

425
00:22:44.164 --> 00:22:46.664
That if you don't look away, you'll be cursed

426
00:22:46.664 --> 00:22:49.664
and become prey to Death.

427
00:22:51.464 --> 00:22:53.664
Death?

428
00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:59.964
What is it, Ran?

429
00:22:59.964 --> 00:23:01.064
It's nothing.

430
00:23:01.064 --> 00:23:03.764
I just felt a bit weird.
