1
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:04,332
Friday the 13th.

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:08,532
On that day, a man died.

3
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:12,132
He was FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

4
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:17,032
Back then, when he intervened with the Black Organization's plan

5
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:19,832
of assassinating Mr. Yasuteru Domon,

6
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:21,332
he took custody of one of the people of the Organization,

7
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:24,332
a woman announcer called Rena Mizunashi.

8
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:26,332
However, she turned out to be a CIA agent

9
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,532
who managed to sneak into the Organization.

10
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,032
Although we deceived the Organization

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,432
that tried to get her back,

12
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:38,232
and succeeded in sneaking her back into the organization again.

13
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:42,432
In order to prove her innocence,

14
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:45,432
she was ordered to shoot Shuichi Akai to death.

15
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:51,032
He was summoned to come see her at Raiha Pass and...

16
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:02,232
I didn't think I was going to end here.

17
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:05,032
I'm surprised too

18
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,132
that everything worked out so smoothly.

19
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:24,432
As such, the FBI has driven into the Organization.

20
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:28,432
A steel wedge that was never to be removed.

21
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:32,032
A large wound that was never to be erased

22
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:34,832
was also carved into their hearts.

23
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,032
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

24
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,732
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

25
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:44,232
The Detective Squad and a band of robbers.

26
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,232
The bank falls into panic with the FBI.

27
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,732
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,632
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:49,632 --> 00:01:52,532
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:43,005
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Clamorous"

31
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:47,905
Give me a break, boss.

32
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:51,405
I'm already past the age of celebrating birthdays.

33
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,405
Don't be like that.

34
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:56,205
We're just going to have a sip to drink.

35
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,105
But...

36
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,705
No need for concern, Camel.

37
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,005
We just want an excuse to go take a break

38
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:06,805
since investigation of the Organization's taking so long.

39
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:10,105
It's your treat of course, isn't it, James?

40
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,205
Yeah.

41
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:14,205
Now that we know, we'd better go choose good liquor!

42
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,805
Hey... nothing too expensive now.

43
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:29,705
A new member of the Organization has started moving.

44
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:32,705
He's good at gathering information, very observant,

45
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,905
and has great insight.

46
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:36,205
He is dreadfully good at probing,

47
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,705
and his code name is...

48
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:38,705
Bourbon.

49
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:43,005
It's been a while since I got that information from Rena Mizunashi

50
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,905
who snuck back into the Organization.

51
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,205
He hasn't shown up at all yet.

52
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,305
That detective-like guy.

53
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:52,205
Nope.

54
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,505
Bourbon's target is probably that girl

55
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,805
who is called Sherry by the Organization.

56
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:00,205
Judging from the chain of events till now,

57
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:03,405
it's no wonder if the Organization thinks

58
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,305
that we the FBI are involved with her.

59
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,905
Therefore, I was thinking that

60
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,405
he would try getting in touch with us somehow.

61
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:13,105
I guess so.

62
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,105
Because in the past, we used a wire-tap

63
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,305
like the one that girl set up,

64
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:18,805
and lured the Organization

65
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:20,905
over to the Mouri Detective Agency too,

66
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,105
and we, the FBI ambushed them there and attacked them.

67
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,705
Although it seems that the one who actually set up the wire-tap

68
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:30,305
was that boy called Conan Edogawa.

69
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:32,105
Come to think of it,

70
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:33,805
he liked that liquor too, didn't he?

71
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,905
-Huh? -Mr. Akai.

72
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,905
He was also the one who shot at the guys

73
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,305
from a building 700 yards away

74
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:44,605
after luring them out, wasn't he?

75
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:49,305
Huh? It wasn't him?

76
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,505
Yeah... I mean, it was, but...

77
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:54,005
If Mr. Akai were around,

78
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,305
we wouldn't have to be afraid of this guy called Bourbon.

79
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,205
We're not afraid!

80
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:01,005
We're just waiting for the Organization

81
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:03,105
to get impatient enough to make their move!

82
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:05,905
Besides, Shuichi Akai is already dead!

83
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:09,405
Don't you mention that name ever again!

84
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,405
I'll see you guys back at the car.

85
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,005
Oh, yes, madam.

86
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,405
Be more considerate, will you?

87
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:21,805
Because to her,

88
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:25,105
Mr. Akai was not just another FBI agent.

89
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,305
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,805
Huh? You're going to go steady?

91
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,905
You mean with a member of the Organization

92
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:42,305
that you mentioned the other day named Ms. Akemi Miyano?

93
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:43,705
Yeah.

94
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:46,205
So, I'd like to end my relationship with you.

95
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,705
Wait, Shu!

96
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:49,905
You're going with her

97
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,505
in order to investigate the Organization, right?

98
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,205
I don't see why we have to end our relationship.

99
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,405
It just means that it's an Organization that I have to crush,

100
00:06:56,405 --> 00:07:00,605
even if it means sacrificing you to do so.

101
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:04,205
I'm not a lover man who's capable

102
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,705
of loving two women at the same time, you see.

103
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,405
That would've been okay with me.

104
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:14,405
To be able to work together with you was enough for me.

105
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,905
But why, Shu?

106
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,005
Why did you have to...

107
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,305
leave so soon...

108
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:30,405
Shu?

109
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,505
Wait up.

110
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,005
Shu, wait.

111
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,905
Shu...

112
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,305
No doubt about it.

113
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,305
That's Shu.

114
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:50,405
But, he's supposed to dead.

115
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,205
Don't tell me he's another man who just resembles him?

116
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,905
I've got to go and make sure.

117
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:58,205
I've got to meet him and make sure.

118
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:04,605
What's up?

119
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:08,205
I don't remember parking my car over here.

120
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,505
Oh well...

121
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,505
Don't tell me you saw someone from the Organization?

122
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,505
It's nothing like that.

123
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:18,105
I just got lost.

124
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:20,505
Did you get to buy good liquor?

125
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:25,505
No, I couldn't use my credit card at that shop.

126
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,405
I didn't have any yen on hand either.

127
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:30,205
I hate to do this to you,

128
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,905
but could you pay the bill for us?

129
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:35,105
What? I was thinking of withdrawing money today,

130
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:36,805
so my wallet's empty.

131
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,305
Is that so...

132
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,805
I'll go to a nearby bank then,

133
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,305
so please wait for me at the shop we just went to.

134
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,305
Yeah, thanks.

135
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:50,105
No...

136
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:51,705
I'm sure that he's someone else.

137
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,405
That was just an illusion,

138
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:54,405
it wasn't Shu.

139
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:59,405
"Teito Bank"

140
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,605
Mitsuhiko, you're going to deposit

141
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,305
all of your New Year's allowance.

142
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:07,405
Yes, because my parents made a bank account for me the other day.

143
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,205
You said that you got a lot.

144
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:12,105
Don't you think it's a waste?

145
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,305
I've got sound judgment.

146
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,905
Then, what did you do with your allowance, Genta?

147
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:19,605
I'm having Mom keep all of it for me.

148
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:22,105
She told me that she'd keep it for me

149
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,005
until I find something expensive that I want.

150
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,705
And... did she ever buy something for you?

151
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,705
Come to think of it, no.

152
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,105
She'd always say that it's too extravagant

153
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,405
or something like that.

154
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,505
Genta's mother's pretty shrewd.

155
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,905
Well, she could be saving it for the time

156
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:40,305
when you fall ill of a serious illness or something.

157
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,805
That's the same as putting the money in your bank account.

158
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:45,105
I'm going to get all the money

159
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:47,105
that I have her keeping for me back.

160
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,605
-Hey... -Besides, I never get sick.

161
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:56,205
It's hurt... my stomach suddenly...

162
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:58,305
Are you all right, Genta?

163
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:01,105
Are you sure you didn't eat something that you shouldn't have?

164
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:04,305
I had two servings of curry rice for lunch.

165
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,605
But, when I went to get you a while ago,

166
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,405
you had kinako around your mouth, right?

167
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:10,605
After I ate the curry,

168
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:12,605
I wanted to eat something sweet,

169
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,705
so I grilled the rice cake that was in the refrigerator

170
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:16,005
and made kinako mochi.

171
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,105
I ate four of that.

172
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:21,805
Then, I started craving for something salty next.

173
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,605
So, I put soy sauce on them,

174
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,005
and ate three of them wrapped with seaweed.

175
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,605
You just ate too much.

176
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,705
I tell you, Genta.

177
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,405
I'll go to a nearby pharmacy

178
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,205
and get you some stomach medicine then.

179
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,205
Go to the bathroom

180
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:37,405
and let out what you have to.

181
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,405
Okay.

182
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,405
I'm sure that all his allowance will disappear

183
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:44,905
just paying for his food bills.

184
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:46,205
You can say that again.

185
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:50,705
-Wasn't that... -Your teacher, Jodie?

186
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,605
She didn't notice us.

187
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,605
Maybe she had something on her mind?

188
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,105
Excuse me, miss,

189
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,305
when using the ATM,

190
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:12,405
please refrain from using your cell phone.

191
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,205
This is to prevent swindling cases that have been increasing lately.

192
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:18,305
Cell phone...

193
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,505
Just like you said,

194
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,205
his fingerprints were found on that cell phone

195
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:25,605
together with yours and Conan's.

196
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:29,105
The fingerprints of the man who burnt to death just a while ago.

197
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:35,005
Right. He died.

198
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,705
You told yourself over and over again.

199
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,405
And yet...

200
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:41,605
to see an illusion like that?

201
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:44,405
I've had enough.

202
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,705
I never want to go through what I went through back then.

203
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,705
Yes, just like being shot right through the chest with a bullet.

204
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:55,305
What was that?

205
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:03,205
Lock the entrances and exits and close the shutters!

206
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,905
All of you, gather in one spot!

207
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,005
"Restroom"

208
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,805
What's going on? That sound...

209
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,605
I sure was loud.

210
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,505
A gunshot. Don't tell me...

211
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,505
Hey, is anything wrong?

212
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,305
Genta, stay as you are.

213
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,505
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, you two stay here too.

214
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,905
I'll go check things out.

215
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:24,305
Oh, Conan!

216
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,305
Hey! Get over here quick, and sit down!

217
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:41,805
Get it?

218
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,905
Hurry it up if you don't want to get hurt.

219
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,105
Listen!

220
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,705
If you're here with a friend or with somebody accompanying you,

221
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:49,705
stay together!

222
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:52,705
Stay with your friends or the person you came with?

223
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,905
Huh?

224
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,305
Is anything the matter?

225
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:03,005
Well, the door is locked.

226
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,905
Besides, things don't look right inside.

227
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,205
Even the shutters closed!

228
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:11,205
What's going on?

229
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:15,405
Hey, what's going on?

230
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:18,005
Don't tell me that...

231
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,305
This is a bank robbery?

232
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:26,205
Okay! Hurry and put the cell phones

233
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,105
that you have inside this bag!

234
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,605
I remember that I experienced something like this

235
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,105
in the past too.

236
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:39,305
Right. That bus jack.

237
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:43,805
But back then...

238
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,505
you were there, Shu.

239
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:51,005
Hey. You foreign lady over there.

240
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,005
Don't you understand Japanese?

241
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:56,105
No, I do, a little bit.

242
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:58,905
Then, get your cell phone out, hurry and sit down.

243
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,705
Okay...

244
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:03,705
Sorry.

245
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,605
Shu...

246
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,405
Shu...

247
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,644
Shu.

248
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:32,644
Are you Shu?

249
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,344
You're Shu, aren't you?

250
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:35,544
Tell me that you're sure!

251
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,744
Can't you tell who I am?

252
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:43,144
Can't you talk?

253
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:48,944
A burn mark...

254
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,744
Don't tell me that...

255
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:54,644
you escaped from that burning Chevy?

256
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,044
You must've lost your memory and ability to talk

257
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:58,644
from the shock back then.

258
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,344
Hey!

259
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:03,444
What's all the fuss about, foreign lady?

260
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,344
Hurry up and put your cell phone inside this bag!

261
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,544
Okay...

262
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,644
Hey, you too! Hurry up, out with it!

263
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,644
Darn, you wanna get blasted away or what?

264
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,644
No... he can't talk

265
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,344
because a shock from accident!

266
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:23,644
The burn marks, they proof!

267
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,544
He cannot talk,

268
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:31,044
so I think he can't use the phone even if he has it.

269
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,244
Okay...

270
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,344
Just sit still right there!

271
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:37,244
Hey, you next!

272
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:38,844
Okay.

273
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:42,644
Either way I've got to take him to everybody at the FBI

274
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,844
and help him get his memory back.

275
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,144
I have to ask him about how he made it out alive

276
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:50,244
and the burnt body remains in the Chevy.

277
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:53,044
In order to do so, I guess I have no choice

278
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:55,344
but to take care of these robbers first.

279
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:58,644
Hey, is the head of this branch here?

280
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,444
Okay, get over here.

281
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,544
Hurry it up!

282
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:05,544
Yes, sir.

283
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,344
No need to panic.

284
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:08,944
All I need you to do

285
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,144
is put all the cash in this case over here.

286
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,544
Easy, huh?

287
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,944
By myself?

288
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:15,944
Yeah.

289
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:18,944
You seem to know the details of where the money is.

290
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,844
Okay, next, all those with nobody or no acquaintances with them!

291
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,144
Stand there on the spot!

292
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:31,344
You guys come get this masking tape!

293
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,344
Tape the eyes and mouths

294
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,944
of those with somebody or acquaintances with them,

295
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:37,344
then tie their hands behind them with the tape.

296
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,644
They may be easy on the people

297
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,244
if know them even a bit.

298
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,844
Here!

299
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:46,344
Of course I'll tie you guys up later myself.

300
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:05,644
That...

301
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,544
I'm sorry, I'm sticking the tape on you.

302
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:10,044
Oh! Before that...

303
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:12,444
please let me go to the restroom!

304
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,744
I'm going to leak!

305
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:17,344
The foreign lady again...

306
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,644
Please!

307
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,544
Okay.

308
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,544
But, first I'm going to cover your eyes, mouth

309
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,244
and tie your hands before you go.

310
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,344
Okay, thank you.

311
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:36,744
Hey! Hurry up and walk!

312
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:39,644
"Restroom"

313
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,344
Stop!

314
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:47,544
Oh well, I guess I can let her use the men's room.

315
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,244
There's nobody here and it can't be seen.

316
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,144
Get in!

317
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,344
Okay, let me know when you finish.

318
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:11,044
I see, with both hands tied,

319
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:13,344
you can't pull down your panty.

320
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,944
I got no choice then.

321
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:36,344
Just as would be expected of an FBI agent on duty.

322
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,744
You're pretty good.

323
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,844
What brings you all here?

324
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:43,044
We all came along with Mitsuhiko

325
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,044
because he wanted to deposit money into his account.

326
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:46,244
But, Genta came down with a stomachache,

327
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:47,844
so we took him to the men's room.

328
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:50,244
Then, we heard a loud bang.

329
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,744
So we stayed hiding in the men's room.

330
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:56,144
My stomach's okay already, though.

331
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:58,744
And? How many robbers are there?

332
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,044
Five of them.

333
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,644
They're all armed with guns.

334
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:04,644
So, they're after the money?

335
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,744
Yes, they were saying to put the cash

336
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:08,744
in the case that they brought.

337
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,744
Something smells fishy.

338
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:14,644
They divided the customers by the friends and acquaintances.

339
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,044
And when collecting the cash,

340
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,444
they made the branch manager do it alone.

341
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:20,244
Besides, for some reason,

342
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,244
they were all concerned about the time.

343
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,244
Time?

344
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:25,644
They seem concerned,

345
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:30,044
but it's no problem if I take them all alone and beat them up.

346
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,444
Hang in there, Jodie!

347
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:33,944
Victory is yet to come!

348
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:35,944
It's okay.

349
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:37,844
You don't need to do anything.

350
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:46,944
I got worried, so I came by to check things out.

351
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,644
And here he is like this.

352
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,544
No good, he's completely passed out.

353
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,544
It'll be a pain carrying him, though.

354
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,344
We don't have that much time.

355
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:57,244
Let's take off his mask and jacket

356
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:59,544
and seat him on the toilet seat.

357
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:01,344
It'll look like a customer who was hiding in the toilet

358
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:04,444
got hit by the robber, right?

359
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,444
Hey, hold the other end!

360
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:09,644
Okay.

361
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:12,444
But, I wonder who that lady is.

362
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,544
Beats me.

363
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:21,844
Well, who cares who she is at this point

364
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,944
because they're all going to blow up.

365
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:26,344
That's true...

366
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:44,144
What shall we do? Jodie got caught.

367
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:47,144
We've got no choice, but to beat them up ourselves.

368
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:50,544
But, they've got five on their side.

369
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:52,744
No, four.

370
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,544
"Teito Bank"

371
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:13,144
Really bad, something really bad happened.

372
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:16,044
We surrounded the bank entirely.

373
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:19,444
And? Did the robbers make any demands?

374
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,044
Nothing yet.

375
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:22,844
I see.

376
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:29,244
Strange.

377
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,444
Huh?

378
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:32,044
At this point,

379
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,844
it's usual that the robbers use the hostages as their shield

380
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:37,744
and demand ways to make it out of the bank.

381
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,844
That's true.

382
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,744
I'm sure they'll give in soon and come out.

383
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,944
Besides, they have no way out anyway.

384
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,344
I wonder about that.

385
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:51,544
I got a look inside before the shutter closed

386
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:55,044
and saw several guys armed with guns wearing masks.

387
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:57,644
In order to raid a bank dressed like that,

388
00:21:57,644 --> 00:22:00,044
they would've had to arm themselves, get into a large vehicle,

389
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,544
parking it right beside the bank

390
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:04,844
and stampede in at once.

391
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:07,144
Being as well prepared as they are,

392
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:09,444
they take the money, yet don't split right away,

393
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:11,244
but rather make no demands,

394
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:13,144
and are still keeping themselves locked up in there.

395
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:14,644
Isn't it strange?

396
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:18,144
Maybe there's something more to this.

397
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:19,744
Maybe they already have a way thought out,

398
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:23,244
out of there splitting with the money and all.

399
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,344
"Next Episode"

400
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,344
What a fox.

401
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:15,044
A bank robbery is never worth it.

402
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:17,044
All you do is lose out.

403
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:20,044
They're saying something about not having enough time.

404
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,944
In the first place, why isn't this guy wearing a mask?

405
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,744
Don't tell me that...

406
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,544
The contents in the case...

407
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:30,344
is probably a bomb.

408
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,144
A Bomb...

409
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,544
Next Conan,

410
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:36,893
"The Detective Squad vs. The Band of Robbers: Silence"

411
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:54,555
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:56,655
"Hostage"

413
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,355
It's finally show time for us!

414
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:00,355
But, first, I've got to eat eels over rice.

415
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:01,543
Hey...
