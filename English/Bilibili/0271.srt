1
00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.624
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:06.024
What does the cross mean?

4
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:07.824
It's a coded case!

5
00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.424
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:11.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.537
I think I've seen him before.

9
00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:04.137
I know I've seen him.

10
00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:06.437
But where did I meet him?

11
00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:09.637
That man in the black knit hat.

12
00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:15.637
And what is this thing I'm feeling?

13
00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:18.737
This uneasiness that I feel like something is gonna break

14
00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:21.337
if I try to remember what it was.

15
00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:25.037
Yeah, at that time...

16
00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:26.537
and that time?

17
00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:34.437
It's the same bad feeling

18
00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:36.037
-Ran... -I felt back then.

19
00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:37.337
Ran!

20
00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:39.937
Hey, Ran!

21
00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:42.137
Ran!

22
00:02:42.137 --> 00:02:44.737
My gosh.

23
00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:46.237
What? Sonoko.

24
00:02:46.237 --> 00:02:47.537
Why are you so slow?

25
00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:50.237
Hey! Ms. Mouri!

26
00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:54.037
Have you been paying attention to my lecture, Ms. Mouri?

27
00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:56.937
Yeah. Yes!

28
00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:59.637
Okay, then, Ms. Mouri.

29
00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.137
Do you have any idea what that mark

30
00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:04.237
on the blackboard means?

31
00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:05.437
What?

32
00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:07.237
Well...

33
00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:09.337
Cross-mark.

34
00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:12.637
Oh, no, maybe it's the letter X". I think?

35
00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:20.437
Ran, that means...

36
00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.037
Time's up!

37
00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:29.337
Ms. Mouri, think about it

38
00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:32.537
and give me an answer by the next class!

39
00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:35.237
Find out exactly what that means.

40
00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:37.437
It pays for a lady like you

41
00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:40.537
to know what the cute mark is!

42
00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:41.837
Okay?

43
00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:43.337
Yes.

44
00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:52.737
"Hide, Hurry up and Abbreviate it (Part 1)"

45
00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:56.337
"X"?

46
00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:59.237
Is there any special meaning?

47
00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:01.437
Yeah! Ms. Jodie, our teacher,

48
00:04:01.437 --> 00:04:05.237
mentioned it at the end of today's class,

49
00:04:05.237 --> 00:04:07.537
saying that it was a cute mark.

50
00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:09.737
Ran! No way! Impossible!

51
00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:11.337
You can't get the right answer

52
00:04:11.337 --> 00:04:12.937
from this snot nosed kid!

53
00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:15.737
But, as you know,

54
00:04:15.737 --> 00:04:18.337
Conan sometimes knows about the strangest things.

55
00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:20.037
Yeah, true.

56
00:04:20.037 --> 00:04:24.637
X...

57
00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:29.137
In algebra, X represents an unknown quantity.

58
00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:30.237
Or, it can mean a problem,

59
00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.837
something unknown, or an unnamed thing.

60
00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:35.937
X-ray means radiograph.

61
00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:39.237
X rating means no one under 18 is admitted.

62
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.937
X day is a variable day

63
00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:43.737
when people think something is going to happen.

64
00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:48.137
Wait, if it is the cross,

65
00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:51.337
the X means wrong or censored print.

66
00:04:51.337 --> 00:04:54.137
One X can also mean that the person has been divorced once.

67
00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:56.037
Right, right.

68
00:04:56.037 --> 00:04:59.237
She said that it paid for a woman to know the mark.

69
00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:00.437
What?

70
00:05:00.437 --> 00:05:02.537
A woman?

71
00:05:02.537 --> 00:05:03.937
That reminds me.

72
00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.437
My mother used to write a series of crosses

73
00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:06.837
at the end of the letter.

74
00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:09.737
Like, XXX.

75
00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:14.237
But she never told me what it meant even if I asked her.

76
00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:15.637
But, Sonoko,

77
00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:18.237
don't you think that Ms. Jodie's way of teaching has changed?

78
00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:19.537
Yeah, yeah!

79
00:05:19.537 --> 00:05:23.837
She used to be too serious and boring before.

80
00:05:23.837 --> 00:05:27.537
But now, she teaches us casual English too

81
00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:29.237
and I like it.

82
00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:31.737
Hi! Remember this, flattery is not going to

83
00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:35.137
get you better grades!

84
00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.937
Ms. Jodie?

85
00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:40.437
Ms. Mouri! Did you figure out what "X" means?

86
00:05:40.437 --> 00:05:43.937
No, not at all.

87
00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:48.237
Right! How about asking Shinichi about it by e-mail?

88
00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:49.437
If you get the right answer,

89
00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:52.337
I'll give you my sweet "X".

90
00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:53.737
What?

91
00:05:53.737 --> 00:05:55.737
My sweet X!

92
00:05:55.737 --> 00:05:57.637
Oh, that's a good idea!

93
00:05:57.637 --> 00:05:58.637
What?

94
00:05:58.637 --> 00:05:59.737
You think so too, don't you?

95
00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:00.837
What was that?

96
00:06:00.837 --> 00:06:03.137
What does X mean anyway?

97
00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:06.737
X...

98
00:06:06.737 --> 00:06:08.037
But...

99
00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:10.837
Aren't you heading in the opposite direction from your apartment?

100
00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:12.237
Yes, now that you mentioned it.

101
00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:16.337
Hey! There's something I want to ask you two.

102
00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:18.037
Will you come with me?

103
00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:22.037
X...

104
00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:24.737
Cross?

105
00:06:24.737 --> 00:06:26.137
What?

106
00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:28.937
Are you asking if we are being sexually harassed?

107
00:06:28.937 --> 00:06:31.037
-You mean us? - You mean us?

108
00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:32.937
Oh, yes!

109
00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:36.137
There are many girls of Teitan high School

110
00:06:36.137 --> 00:06:39.837
who being sexually harassed on the trains and buses.

111
00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:42.137
We've never been harassed, have we?

112
00:06:42.137 --> 00:06:43.737
Yes.

113
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:47.937
And even if such a pervert tries to molest me

114
00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:51.137
then Ran will bust him up with her karate skills!

115
00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:53.237
Oh! You're her bodyguard!

116
00:06:53.237 --> 00:06:54.837
No...

117
00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:58.737
But still be careful!

118
00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:04.037
Maybe the guy will follow you all the way home

119
00:07:04.037 --> 00:07:07.437
waiting for a chance to get to you.

120
00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:13.737
He may be a super scary and demon-like stalker.

121
00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:16.737
If such a man is creeping around near my home,

122
00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:19.137
the guard will grab and throw him out immediately.

123
00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:22.537
I also haven't seen such a man around my neighborhood.

124
00:07:22.537 --> 00:07:23.837
Right, Conan?

125
00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:25.237
What?

126
00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:26.737
Yeah.

127
00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:27.737
Okay, then.

128
00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:29.337
If you see any suspicious person,

129
00:07:29.337 --> 00:07:34.337
please call me at once.

130
00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:36.037
-Call you? -Call you?

131
00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:41.937
Yes! Japanese people still underestimate the stalker.

132
00:07:41.937 --> 00:07:44.837
If you call me, I'll give that guy

133
00:07:44.837 --> 00:07:47.937
a good scolding, American style.

134
00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:50.637
What?

135
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:54.237
A suspicious man is waiting in ambush for you?

136
00:07:54.237 --> 00:07:56.637
"Norihisa Kisugi (50)" -Where are you now?

137
00:07:56.637 --> 00:07:59.637
At the building where the coffee shop is.

138
00:07:59.637 --> 00:08:02.537
I said a suspicious man but...

139
00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:03.937
he may well be the man in question

140
00:08:03.937 --> 00:08:06.437
who I have been checking on.

141
00:08:06.437 --> 00:08:08.837
"Katsunori Chujo (43)" -When he meets me,

142
00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:11.237
he'll probably say,

143
00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:13.937
"I'll pay you double the reward you're getting,"

144
00:08:13.937 --> 00:08:17.237
"so please let me go."

145
00:08:17.237 --> 00:08:19.937
Yeah, listen, let's make a deal.

146
00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:21.737
Okay!

147
00:08:21.737 --> 00:08:22.837
I'll pay you triple!

148
00:08:22.837 --> 00:08:24.237
No, quadruple!

149
00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.337
So, please hurry and come over here now

150
00:08:26.337 --> 00:08:28.837
and give me the guy's name and the evidence.

151
00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:31.537
It's a deal. I'll be right over!

152
00:08:31.537 --> 00:08:36.437
He can't pay me four times, so I guess he'll give it up.

153
00:08:36.437 --> 00:08:37.537
Sorry, but that's the story.

154
00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:41.437
No offense, Mr. Man-in-question.

155
00:08:49.837 --> 00:08:51.737
Hey... I won't change my mind

156
00:08:51.737 --> 00:08:53.237
even if you follow me around.

157
00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:55.837
You're finished at any rate.

158
00:08:55.837 --> 00:08:57.737
Because...

159
00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.837
all the details of your evil doings

160
00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:01.737
are contained in this envelope.

161
00:09:13.837 --> 00:09:14.937
No.

162
00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:17.137
What's going on?

163
00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:19.137
Is it a black out?

164
00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:22.837
Oh, the lights turned on again.

165
00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:25.237
Oh, what a scare.

166
00:09:25.237 --> 00:09:26.937
It can't be helped, Sonoko,

167
00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:28.937
because you've experienced a blackout

168
00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:30.437
in a building before...

169
00:09:35.937 --> 00:09:39.837
Hey! It's right in front of this shop!

170
00:09:39.837 --> 00:09:42.937
It is! I wonder what happened.

171
00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:58.037
Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki,

172
00:09:58.037 --> 00:10:00.437
call the police and an ambulance!

173
00:10:00.437 --> 00:10:01.537
Yes!

174
00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.637
What?

175
00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:10.337
Something was written on the envelope he's holding.

176
00:10:10.337 --> 00:10:13.437
Circle, Cross, Triangle?

177
00:10:13.437 --> 00:10:14.637
What's this?

178
00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:32.786
A thrust with a knife into his abdomen.

179
00:10:32.786 --> 00:10:35.186
Yes. The murdered victim is

180
00:10:35.186 --> 00:10:38.386
Mr. Katsunori Chujo, 43 years old.

181
00:10:38.386 --> 00:10:39.986
Judging from a name card he carried,

182
00:10:39.986 --> 00:10:42.186
he is the director of a private detective agency.

183
00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:43.786
Oh, a detective.

184
00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:45.886
But what I don't understand is

185
00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:49.086
this bizarre dying message.

186
00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:53.586
No... It's a dying message!

187
00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:56.186
Your...

188
00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:59.386
Hi, I'm Jodie Saintemillion!

189
00:10:59.386 --> 00:11:04.586
Nice to see you again, inspector.

190
00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:06.386
Before you correct his English,

191
00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:09.586
improve your Japanese first!

192
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.186
But you're the type who really gets involved

193
00:11:12.186 --> 00:11:14.186
in all sorts of cases, aren't you?

194
00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:15.386
Yes!

195
00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:19.486
But I'm still no match for them!

196
00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:23.686
Oh, you're also here, Ran and Sonoko!

197
00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:26.586
When we were in that coffee shop,

198
00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.186
the power suddenly went out.

199
00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:30.086
And just after the lights turned on again,

200
00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:32.186
we heard a woman scream.

201
00:11:32.186 --> 00:11:34.486
Then, we came here and saw the man.

202
00:11:36.386 --> 00:11:37.886
Blackout?

203
00:11:37.886 --> 00:11:40.686
Yes, the blackout was caused by a mistake

204
00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:44.386
made by an electrician during maintenance.

205
00:11:44.386 --> 00:11:47.486
And the blackout lasted only fifteen seconds or so.

206
00:11:47.486 --> 00:11:49.286
So, the murderer,

207
00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:53.586
taking advantage of this coincidence.

208
00:11:53.586 --> 00:11:59.386
Meanwhile, Mr. Chujo, just before dying,

209
00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.986
left the odd dying message.

210
00:12:04.586 --> 00:12:06.286
But, what's this?

211
00:12:06.286 --> 00:12:08.386
This circle, the cross and the triangle.

212
00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:11.586
They are symbols often used for unprintable words.

213
00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:16.286
Is it possible that this could be someone's name?

214
00:12:16.286 --> 00:12:18.186
I have a feeling that

215
00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:19.986
I've seen those symbols somewhere before!

216
00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:20.986
What?

217
00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:23.586
What? What did you say?

218
00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:25.286
Where did you see them?

219
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.086
Please remember, Ms. Jodie!

220
00:12:31.786 --> 00:12:33.586
The controller!

221
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:38.586
Those symbols are on the Japanese PC game controller.

222
00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:42.186
Did it help you at all?

223
00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:46.186
Oh, yeah. I remember this teacher is a PC gamer.

224
00:12:46.186 --> 00:12:47.786
Inspector Megure!

225
00:12:47.786 --> 00:12:49.786
The victims cell phone log shows that someone called him

226
00:12:49.786 --> 00:12:51.186
30 minutes ago.

227
00:12:51.186 --> 00:12:52.186
What?

228
00:12:52.186 --> 00:12:53.786
30 minutes ago!

229
00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:55.886
That's about the time when he was killed!

230
00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:58.086
So then why don't you return the call?

231
00:12:58.086 --> 00:12:59.086
What?

232
00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:00.686
Oh, yeah.

233
00:13:21.386 --> 00:13:22.886
You are the one

234
00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:26.586
who called Mr. Chujo 30 minutes ago, right?

235
00:13:26.586 --> 00:13:28.686
Oh, no... I just...

236
00:13:28.686 --> 00:13:30.086
Hey!

237
00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:32.686
He might be the guy who was calling back then.

238
00:13:34.586 --> 00:13:37.786
I heard this guy talking about something suspicious!

239
00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:39.186
Let's see.

240
00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.886
He said, I'll pay four times as much

241
00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.586
so come here immediately or something like that.

242
00:13:43.586 --> 00:13:46.786
Can you help me make sense of it?

243
00:13:46.786 --> 00:13:50.086
I understand. I'll tell you everything!

244
00:13:50.086 --> 00:13:52.386
I'll explain everything. I promise.

245
00:13:54.686 --> 00:13:57.786
So your company hired a private detective

246
00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:00.286
to conduct its own internal investigation.

247
00:14:00.286 --> 00:14:01.686
That's right.

248
00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:03.086
Last month, we discovered that

249
00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:05.886
an employee has secretly been embezzling money

250
00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:07.986
from our company.

251
00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:09.886
So, an executive ordered me to find out

252
00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:13.186
who it was before informing the president of the mess.

253
00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.686
Where is your company?

254
00:14:15.686 --> 00:14:19.986
Our company occupies the 8th to 11th floor of this building.

255
00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:21.586
I see.

256
00:14:21.586 --> 00:14:23.086
You got a call from the private detective

257
00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:25.386
that he tracked down the embezzler.

258
00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:27.986
So, you tried to avoid meeting him in your office

259
00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:30.686
and arranged to meet him at this cafe.

260
00:14:30.686 --> 00:14:33.186
But as he didn't show up

261
00:14:33.186 --> 00:14:34.686
at the appointed time,

262
00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:36.986
you called him, right?

263
00:14:36.986 --> 00:14:38.386
Yes.

264
00:14:38.386 --> 00:14:42.886
As the envelope Mr. Chujo was holding was empty,

265
00:14:42.886 --> 00:14:44.886
I think the embezzler and the murderer

266
00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:47.086
are the same person?

267
00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:49.686
Yeah. It's quite possible that

268
00:14:49.686 --> 00:14:51.386
the embezzler killed the private investigator

269
00:14:51.386 --> 00:14:54.586
and then ran inside into one of the offices upstairs.

270
00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:59.086
But, do you have any idea who the embezzler is?

271
00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:00.386
Oh, no.

272
00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:02.986
Last week, the private investigator

273
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.786
gave me an interim report that

274
00:15:05.786 --> 00:15:09.186
included a list of suspicious employees.

275
00:15:09.186 --> 00:15:11.886
Here is the list!

276
00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:13.786
Inspector Megure!

277
00:15:13.786 --> 00:15:17.686
Geez, it'll take a bit of doing to check them all.

278
00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:23.586
There are 58 suspects.

279
00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:25.486
The only clues so far

280
00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:28.286
are the symbols, a circle, a cross and a triangle.

281
00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:30.486
How intriguing.

282
00:15:35.786 --> 00:15:37.786
Inspector Megure!

283
00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:40.686
The fingerprints of Mr. Chujo,

284
00:15:40.686 --> 00:15:42.286
who was stabbed to death,

285
00:15:42.286 --> 00:15:43.986
were detected on the symbols written with blood.

286
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:46.086
Oh, I see!

287
00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:49.086
As we expected, the blood was Mr. Chujo's

288
00:15:49.086 --> 00:15:51.386
and it also hasn't been long since he wrote them.

289
00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:52.486
So, there's almost no doubt

290
00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:56.286
that he wrote the circle, cross and triangle,

291
00:15:56.286 --> 00:16:02.186
as a clue or a dying message

292
00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:04.886
to identity the murderer.

293
00:16:04.886 --> 00:16:05.986
Good.

294
00:16:09.286 --> 00:16:11.886
Also it seems that Mr. Chujo was stabbed

295
00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:13.886
before the black out.

296
00:16:13.886 --> 00:16:15.686
Before the blackout?

297
00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:19.486
Yes. According to a witness,

298
00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:24.586
the lights went out after a man in a coat stabbed Mr. Chujo.

299
00:16:24.586 --> 00:16:27.286
The spot where he was stabbed is around here,

300
00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.886
just in front of the escalator.

301
00:16:28.886 --> 00:16:34.086
The blackout started while the two scrambled for his envelope.

302
00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:35.386
When the lights came back on,

303
00:16:35.386 --> 00:16:38.586
Mr. Chujo's body moved to the escalator

304
00:16:38.586 --> 00:16:40.486
and was crouched there.

305
00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:42.686
The man in the coat approached him,

306
00:16:42.686 --> 00:16:45.486
pulled something like a document out of the envelope

307
00:16:45.486 --> 00:16:48.886
and ran up the stairs!

308
00:16:48.886 --> 00:16:54.286
So then, Mr. Chujo wrote the circle, cross and triangle here

309
00:16:54.286 --> 00:16:57.286
around the bottom of the escalator.

310
00:16:57.286 --> 00:17:00.586
Yes. He probably wrote them during the blackout.

311
00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:04.286
You mean, Mr. Chujo tried to hold on tight to the envelope

312
00:17:04.286 --> 00:17:06.886
in order to keep it from being stolen,

313
00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:10.486
but the killer managed to get it after all.

314
00:17:10.486 --> 00:17:12.086
So, he died in that position

315
00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:16.386
and was brought to the top by the escalator.

316
00:17:16.386 --> 00:17:21.486
But why didn't the witness scream right then and there?

317
00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:26.086
The witness thought they were filming a suspense drama.

318
00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:28.386
Anyway, it is almost certain that

319
00:17:28.386 --> 00:17:31.286
the murderer is the embezzler!

320
00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:32.286
So, all we have to do now is

321
00:17:32.286 --> 00:17:37.386
figure out what the circle, cross and triangle means

322
00:17:37.386 --> 00:17:40.186
and from this list of 58 suspects,

323
00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:43.786
Find out which one it refers to.

324
00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:46.286
Don't you think that the X on the envelope

325
00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:47.986
represents the multiplication symbol?

326
00:17:47.986 --> 00:17:49.386
And the circle, cross, and triangle

327
00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:53.186
represent a mathematical formula?

328
00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:56.086
But, why does it have to be a circle, cross and triangle?

329
00:17:56.086 --> 00:17:57.386
If the equation is written,

330
00:17:57.386 --> 00:17:59.286
the culprit could destroy the evidence,

331
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:02.286
so the culprit camouflaged it by using a circle, cross and triangle!

332
00:18:02.286 --> 00:18:06.386
I see. So, the murderer must be a mathematician!

333
00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:10.586
Is there an employee who excels at mathematics in your company?

334
00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:12.186
No. We primarily focus on recruiting

335
00:18:12.186 --> 00:18:17.686
those who are adept at different languages.

336
00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:22.186
If it were triangle, circle and square,

337
00:18:22.186 --> 00:18:23.786
it would look like Oden,

338
00:18:23.786 --> 00:18:27.686
Hey, maybe the cross stands for that "X"?

339
00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:30.286
You know. The cute "X" mark

340
00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:31.986
that Ms. Jodie mentioned in class!

341
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.086
-What? -What?

342
00:18:35.786 --> 00:18:36.986
No...

343
00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:39.786
No... It's definitely not that X.

344
00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:43.886
Do you mean the mark

345
00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:47.286
the girls often put at the end of letters?

346
00:18:47.286 --> 00:18:48.786
Oh, yes!

347
00:18:48.786 --> 00:18:50.286
Officer Takagi!

348
00:18:50.286 --> 00:18:53.586
Do you know the meaning of that X?

349
00:18:53.586 --> 00:18:57.586
I see. So, you must often get those kinds of letters.

350
00:18:57.586 --> 00:19:00.486
Well... No. Only on rare occasions.

351
00:19:03.386 --> 00:19:06.286
So, what is the meaning of the X then?

352
00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:09.186
It has absolutely nothing to do with

353
00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:11.686
the circle, cross and triangle in this case.

354
00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.786
Hey, maybe it's not just a circle, cross and triangle,

355
00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:17.486
but another message!

356
00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:19.186
What?

357
00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:20.886
Look carefully and closely.

358
00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:23.886
At the edge of the envelope on the left side of the circle mark.

359
00:19:23.886 --> 00:19:26.286
There's a blood stain!

360
00:19:26.286 --> 00:19:29.086
I think there was something else

361
00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:31.086
besides the circle, cross and triangle.

362
00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:34.586
Oh, we've already noticed it too.

363
00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:38.086
But there was no matching trace of blood left anywhere.

364
00:19:38.086 --> 00:19:40.986
Well, did you check the you-know-where too?

365
00:19:40.986 --> 00:19:43.186
The steps of this escalator.

366
00:19:45.486 --> 00:19:46.886
This escalator isn't running right now,

367
00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:49.386
but when the body was found, it was moving.

368
00:19:49.386 --> 00:19:50.886
So another character written with blood

369
00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:52.586
must be hidden behind the escalator!

370
00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:54.886
That makes sense.

371
00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:57.186
But since the escalator was moving for quite some time,

372
00:19:57.186 --> 00:19:58.286
don't you think the mark

373
00:19:58.286 --> 00:19:59.986
might have been completely wiped out by now?

374
00:19:59.986 --> 00:20:01.586
No problem!

375
00:20:01.586 --> 00:20:04.486
The blood will emit light like magic

376
00:20:04.486 --> 00:20:06.686
if a chemical called mineral or something

377
00:20:06.686 --> 00:20:08.186
is sprayed on the spot!

378
00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:09.686
Right, Officer Takagi?

379
00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:11.186
Oh, yeah.

380
00:20:11.186 --> 00:20:14.386
The luminol solution can detect traces of blood.

381
00:20:14.386 --> 00:20:18.286
Since the victim wrote that while crouching,

382
00:20:18.286 --> 00:20:21.286
it should be easy to tell which step it was

383
00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:25.286
because it would emit light brighter than any other steps!

384
00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:27.586
That's right.

385
00:20:27.586 --> 00:20:29.386
And, just one more thing.

386
00:20:29.386 --> 00:20:31.686
What is it?

387
00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:32.886
What's the meaning of the X?

388
00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:34.186
What?

389
00:20:34.186 --> 00:20:38.586
You know, the one you guys talked about earlier.

390
00:20:38.586 --> 00:20:40.286
I think it's a bit too early for a kid like you

391
00:20:40.286 --> 00:20:41.886
to understand something like that yet.

392
00:20:41.886 --> 00:20:45.786
Officer, could you check on this?

393
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:48.986
Inspector Megure! We've found a coat,

394
00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:51.486
a hat and a pair of gloves that are probably the culprits.

395
00:20:51.486 --> 00:20:53.586
I see.

396
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.386
Those belongings had been left in a bathroom

397
00:20:55.386 --> 00:20:58.586
on the fifth floor that is rarely used,

398
00:20:58.586 --> 00:21:00.386
but the document that had been stolen

399
00:21:00.386 --> 00:21:01.786
from the victim weren't found there.

400
00:21:01.786 --> 00:21:06.186
Then, have you checked the suspects alibis?

401
00:21:06.186 --> 00:21:08.486
Yes, Sir! We split up and checked them out.

402
00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:09.586
At the time of the incident,

403
00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:10.886
many employees were either taking a nap

404
00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:13.286
or out for supper alone.

405
00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:15.086
So, we could confirm the alibis of

406
00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:18.986
only 27 out of the 58 on the list.

407
00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:23.486
Here are the names of the 31 people without alibis!

408
00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:27.586
We're still searching for the stolen document,

409
00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:30.986
concentrating heavily on the floors from 8 to 11,

410
00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:32.986
but haven't found them yet.

411
00:21:32.986 --> 00:21:36.286
Okay, then you continue to search for it!

412
00:21:36.286 --> 00:21:38.686
Yes, Sir!

413
00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:42.186
We've narrowed the list down to 31 suspects.

414
00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:44.986
Yet, that circle, cross and triangle are the only clues we have.

415
00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:46.686
Unless we find another character

416
00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:50.386
from the step of the escalator...

417
00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:52.386
Inspector, we've found another character written with blood!

418
00:21:52.386 --> 00:21:55.386
What! What character is that?

419
00:21:55.386 --> 00:21:57.486
Inspector, it's a...

420
00:21:57.486 --> 00:22:00.586
What is this about?

421
00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:02.486
A square?

422
00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:04.686
It also looks like a Kanji character, mouth

423
00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:07.386
or "ro" in the Katakana alphabet.

424
00:22:07.386 --> 00:22:10.086
But judging from the previous circle, cross and triangle,

425
00:22:10.086 --> 00:22:11.486
is most likely to be a square.

426
00:22:13.486 --> 00:22:15.486
Well... I'm more confused than ever now.

427
00:22:15.486 --> 00:22:18.686
As it's shape matches with the trace of blood on the envelope,

428
00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:22.586
this was definitely written by Mr. Chujo.

429
00:22:25.786 --> 00:22:27.586
Isn't that square...

430
00:22:27.586 --> 00:22:31.686
a little bigger than the other circle, cross and triangle?

431
00:24:05.386 --> 00:24:08.486
"Next Episode" -Hello... Inspector Chiba?

432
00:24:08.486 --> 00:24:10.686
Where are you now?

433
00:24:10.686 --> 00:24:12.186
Yeah.

434
00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:13.586
All right! Just hold on.

435
00:24:13.586 --> 00:24:15.286
I'll be right up.

436
00:24:18.786 --> 00:24:21.986
Dr. Agasa said it's okay to abbreviate something sometimes,

437
00:24:21.986 --> 00:24:24.886
particularly when you're in a hurry.

438
00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:27.886
Hide it. Hurry it up and abbreviate it.

439
00:24:27.886 --> 00:24:29.286
Is that it?

440
00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:31.286
Next Conan,

441
00:24:31.286 --> 00:24:35.307
"Hide, Hurry up and Abbreviate it (Part 2)"

442
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:38.304
Next Conan Hint:

443
00:24:38.304 --> 00:24:40.204
"Square"
