1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.740
I went to the hotel where Sera is residing with Ran and Sonoko.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.940
On our way back home,

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.740
there is a murder on the floor below us.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.340
-"Keigo Hiura (48)" -Maybe it has something to do with that fax.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.940
We got a fax this morning saying,

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.440
"If you don't make his assistant quit, you're going to pay for it."

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.040
Why didn't you tell me that?

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.840
You had all the time in the world to tell me, didn't you?

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.940
I see.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.940
The killer is...

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.440
That guy.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.840
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

14
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040
The contents of the novel close in on the case.

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040
Who's that girl that resembles Sera?

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.540
His name is Detective Conan.

19
00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:43.211
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 2)"

20
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:46.411
It's Takagi.

21
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:49.911
I've got something I'd like to confirm with you.

22
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:50.911
What?

23
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:54.111
The caps of the shampoo and hair conditioner are gone?

24
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:55.511
You mean in the victim's room?

25
00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:56.811
Yes.

26
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.411
They're the amenity goods that came in the bathroom.

27
00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:03.911
I looked in the drain but couldn't find them either.

28
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.811
We just went into the front door, you know?

29
00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:10.111
Then, were you the ones who knocked the table over too.

30
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.111
Table?

31
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.511
The room was virtually untouched,

32
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.511
but for some reason only the table was knocked over.

33
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.111
And, the beer can that was thought to have been on top of it,

34
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.611
was found in the suitcase of the victim

35
00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:27.511
and her clothes were drenched with beer.

36
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:29.711
What kind of suitcase was it?

37
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.211
A pretty big one.

38
00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:36.011
Although there wasn't much stuff in it.

39
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:37.711
What was in it?

40
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:43.111
Besides her clothes, cosmetics, a tablet and knapsack.

41
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:44.611
Oh, right.

42
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:48.711
There was an old postcard in the pocket of the knapsack too.

43
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:49.811
Old...

44
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.311
Postcard?

45
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.411
Yes.

46
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:54.511
It was postmarked 20 years ago.

47
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:57.311
The sender was Mr. Hiura.

48
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.611
It said, "It's quite a cute story.

49
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.811
When I write this kind of story,

50
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:06.411
I'd like to use your name as the heroine's."

51
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:09.211
But the receiver's name wasn't Chiaki Minazuki,

52
00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:11.411
but rather, Jun Ota.

53
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.011
Jun Ota?

54
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:17.211
That's the name of the heroine of the serialized novel,

55
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:20.811
"Telephone, Sea, and I" that Mr. Hiura is writing now!

56
00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:21.911
Is that so?

57
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:22.911
Yes!

58
00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:25.411
What kind of story is it?

59
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:30.111
Well... One day the heroine picks up

60
00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:31.811
an old worn out cell phone on the beach.

61
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.611
But for some strange reason

62
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.111
that cell phone was a new model

63
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.811
that she was planning to buy next week.

64
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:43.011
While she was staring at the cell phone in wonder,

65
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.511
she suddenly gets text mail

66
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.011
saying, "How old are you?"

67
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.811
Sounds dangerous.

68
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.211
Right? The heroine thought so too

69
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.611
and texted him back saying, "I'd never give out private info, stupid."

70
00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:00.311
"Your way of writing tells me that you've just entered high school.

71
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.511
How nostalgic." Is what he texted back.

72
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.811
After that he guesses many things correctly.

73
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.111
He prophesizes the results of the soccer

74
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:08.711
and baseball games of that day correctly.

75
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:11.611
Don't tell me that's...

76
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:12.711
Right!

77
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.711
Somebody sent the heroine's future cell phone to her

78
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:17.811
using a time warp device!

79
00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:20.411
Time warp device?

80
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.611
Yes! To put it easier, a time machine!

81
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:28.711
When the heroine knows that something terrible will happen in future,

82
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.911
she gradually changes the future little by little to prevent it!

83
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.211
It sounds a bit interesting.

84
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:36.811
You think so too, don't you?

85
00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:40.111
And, the heroine asks every chance she gets.

86
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:41.911
"Who are you?

87
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:45.011
What's your connection to me?"

88
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.611
But, the answer is always the same,

89
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:49.611
"Telephone, Sea, and I".

90
00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:53.211
Just what's that supposed to mean?

91
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:56.211
The heroine couldn't figure it out either

92
00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.811
but she finally seems to have figured the meaning out recently.

93
00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:01.011
She returns this answer to him.

94
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:03.811
"Telephone, Sea, and I".

95
00:06:03.811 --> 00:06:04.911
What?

96
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:08.811
The answer is finally going to be disclosed next week in the last episode.

97
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.511
I really can't wait any longer!

98
00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:16.111
That Mr. Hiura sure is daring.

99
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:18.311
Even in his ultra tight situation,

100
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:22.411
he invited the editors, who were keeping watch over him, into his room,

101
00:06:22.411 --> 00:06:25.711
treat them to a meal, and coaxed them.

102
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:27.611
If I were in his situation,

103
00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:30.211
I'd probably shave my head bald

104
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:32.811
and apologize asking for extra time.

105
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:38.111
Well, in his case, he's already shaved.

106
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.211
Hey, did that Mr. Hiura already return to his room?

107
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:46.711
No. After all he is one of the suspects too,

108
00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:48.611
so until the forensics finish their investigation,

109
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:51.611
I'm having him wait in front of his room.

110
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.711
Then, he should still have it on him.

111
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.511
Have what?

112
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.411
A mistake that he failed to correct.

113
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.911
A typo in completing the alibi trick.

114
00:07:15.687 --> 00:07:17.887
Hey! Enough already!

115
00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:20.587
How long is it going to take you to check my room?

116
00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:22.687
You're not going to find anything!

117
00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:26.487
The corpse was found in her room right below here.

118
00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:30.387
She was killed at around 3:30 pm, wasn't she?

119
00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:33.187
At that time I was in this room right through,

120
00:07:33.187 --> 00:07:36.887
and I even have somebody who can testify to that!

121
00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:38.887
Tell them too, will you?

122
00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:41.087
Yes.

123
00:07:41.087 --> 00:07:43.887
It's true that we were eating here

124
00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:47.587
in Mr. Hiura's room between 3 pm to 4:30 pm.

125
00:07:47.587 --> 00:07:50.887
During that time, Mr. Hiura was taking a bath,

126
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.687
and although he didn't eat with us,

127
00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:57.087
there's no doubt that he didn't leave this room!

128
00:07:57.087 --> 00:08:02.587
We were eating at that table that faces the front door.

129
00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:04.487
But, if it was the room right below,

130
00:08:04.487 --> 00:08:08.087
by using a rope, you could use the veranda to.

131
00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.787
Don't be ridiculous.

132
00:08:09.787 --> 00:08:12.487
This is the 30th floor, you know.

133
00:08:12.487 --> 00:08:14.687
I'm no James Bond,

134
00:08:14.687 --> 00:08:16.387
I'm just an ordinary novelist.

135
00:08:16.387 --> 00:08:18.987
I could never carry out a stunt like that!

136
00:08:18.987 --> 00:08:22.787
Besides, you can see the veranda from the table too, isn't it?

137
00:08:22.787 --> 00:08:24.587
True.

138
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:29.087
If you insist on taking up any more of my private time,

139
00:08:29.087 --> 00:08:32.387
then, explain it to me, how did I get out of this room

140
00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.787
at the time of the crime and how did I return?

141
00:08:35.887 --> 00:08:39.487
You had no need to go out nor return!

142
00:08:43.787 --> 00:08:47.187
Because you invited the victim into this room,

143
00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:49.987
and killed her here!

144
00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:52.487
He invited the victim into this room?

145
00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:54.587
What're you talking about?

146
00:08:54.587 --> 00:08:56.887
If Minazuki came to this room,

147
00:08:56.887 --> 00:08:59.287
one of the editors would've noticed, right?

148
00:08:59.287 --> 00:09:00.987
They all know what she looks like too!

149
00:09:00.987 --> 00:09:03.387
Hey, she didn't come, did she?

150
00:09:03.387 --> 00:09:04.987
No.

151
00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:07.187
But...

152
00:09:07.187 --> 00:09:10.587
There were many people who brought deliveries, right?

153
00:09:10.587 --> 00:09:11.987
Yes.

154
00:09:11.987 --> 00:09:15.687
If Ms. Minazuki was dressed like a delivery person,

155
00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:18.087
and changed her hairstyle and all,

156
00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:21.187
I think I'd be deceived.

157
00:09:21.187 --> 00:09:23.887
That maybe the case

158
00:09:23.887 --> 00:09:27.587
but they all left after we paid them.

159
00:09:28.887 --> 00:09:33.187
Then what about that wine that's on the table?

160
00:09:33.187 --> 00:09:35.587
If a decanter was ordered,

161
00:09:35.587 --> 00:09:39.287
it wouldn't be strange for that person to go inside the room, right?

162
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.387
Come to think of it,

163
00:09:41.387 --> 00:09:42.787
there was a person who delivered wine

164
00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:45.487
and was asked to bring a decanter.

165
00:09:45.487 --> 00:09:47.387
If I remember correctly, she was a bell girl who wore glasses

166
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:50.387
and had her hair bunched up behind.

167
00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:52.087
A bell girl?

168
00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:56.187
Did you see that bell girl leave the room?

169
00:09:56.187 --> 00:09:57.687
Oh, no.

170
00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:59.887
Because I was too busy eating.

171
00:09:59.887 --> 00:10:03.087
Right. That was his purpose!

172
00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:06.987
When you were watching him from outside the room,

173
00:10:06.987 --> 00:10:08.987
you were carefully checking

174
00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:13.187
the number of people going in and out of the room, right?

175
00:10:13.187 --> 00:10:18.787
Because Mr. Hiura may disguise himself as a deliveryman and flee.

176
00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:22.687
But, if all of you who were watching him were invited into his room,

177
00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:24.987
you wouldn't be that particular about the number of people.

178
00:10:24.987 --> 00:10:26.687
Because so it didn't matter how many people came,

179
00:10:26.687 --> 00:10:32.887
as long as Mr. Hiura didn't leave and go out the front door.

180
00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:34.287
That's why you weren't really concerned

181
00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:37.287
even if the bell girl brought the wine

182
00:10:37.287 --> 00:10:40.887
and went inside the room, but never came out!

183
00:10:40.887 --> 00:10:44.987
Then, are you saying that the bell girl was Ms. Minazuki?

184
00:10:44.987 --> 00:10:50.187
Yes! While the editors were eating in the living room,

185
00:10:50.187 --> 00:10:52.987
he had instructed to take a bath,

186
00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:54.787
and killed her

187
00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.487
in the bathroom.

188
00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:03.487
He probably chose the bathroom

189
00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:07.687
because then she would take off the bell girl's clothes on her own.

190
00:11:07.687 --> 00:11:11.287
Since the corpse was dressed in a bathrobe that are easy to put on.

191
00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:15.787
But why did the victim disguise herself as the bell girl?

192
00:11:15.787 --> 00:11:18.087
Since she's the assistant, she should've just walked right in.

193
00:11:18.087 --> 00:11:20.987
That's because she was being hassled with the lover's scandal thing.

194
00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:25.687
If the editors who were on guard see her going into the room,

195
00:11:25.687 --> 00:11:28.487
who knows what they'll write the next time around?

196
00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:31.987
That's why he probably asked her to do so.

197
00:11:33.187 --> 00:11:36.887
Quite an interesting trick.

198
00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:41.187
If I ever have a chance to write a mystery novel,

199
00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:44.487
I'd like to use it for reference.

200
00:11:44.487 --> 00:11:47.387
Tell me one thing.

201
00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:49.487
Just how did I move that body

202
00:11:49.487 --> 00:11:53.987
from this room to the room below?

203
00:11:56.587 --> 00:12:00.487
I left the room at around 5:30 pm!

204
00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:05.287
That's 30 minutes before the bell boy found the corpse in the room below!

205
00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:08.087
Was a carrying the body back then?

206
00:12:08.087 --> 00:12:09.487
No.

207
00:12:09.487 --> 00:12:12.087
The only thing you were holding was your wallet.

208
00:12:12.087 --> 00:12:16.187
After I left the room to the time the bell boy screamed,

209
00:12:16.187 --> 00:12:18.087
where and what were you doing?

210
00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:20.287
I was in front of your room,

211
00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:25.287
reading the completed part of the manuscript.

212
00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:29.187
It's too bad, I can't write your mystery story.

213
00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:31.787
There are too many loopholes.

214
00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:34.087
Oh, yes!

215
00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.687
It's about time.

216
00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:38.387
Officer Takagi. Do it, will you?

217
00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:41.187
Takagi?

218
00:12:41.187 --> 00:12:43.187
Inspector Megure!

219
00:12:43.187 --> 00:12:46.487
Just now something fell from the floor above to the veranda.

220
00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:47.987
What?

221
00:12:47.987 --> 00:12:49.787
The veranda?

222
00:12:52.787 --> 00:12:54.187
This is...

223
00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:56.787
A suitcase!

224
00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:59.487
Why would something like this fall from above.

225
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.187
Oh, Inspector!

226
00:13:01.187 --> 00:13:04.487
Please open that suitcase over there!

227
00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:07.987
What's going on here?

228
00:13:14.887 --> 00:13:17.587
Two bags of rice?

229
00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:19.787
One bag is 30 kg.

230
00:13:19.787 --> 00:13:21.687
Together they total 60 kg.

231
00:13:21.687 --> 00:13:24.587
Just about the weight of one human.

232
00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:27.687
Don't tell me that corpse was put in a suitcase.

233
00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:32.087
Yes! It's scary to use a rope to go down yourself

234
00:13:32.087 --> 00:13:34.487
but it's easy to slide a rope through the handle of a suitcase

235
00:13:34.487 --> 00:13:37.587
with a corpse inside it and suspend it, right?

236
00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:38.787
If you use a swinging reaction,

237
00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:42.687
you can swing the suitcase onto the inside of the veranda below.

238
00:13:42.687 --> 00:13:44.487
The rope that is passed through the handle,

239
00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:48.487
can be retrieved by pulling on one side if it isn't tied!

240
00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:52.187
If so, the suitcase that was in the victim's room

241
00:13:52.887 --> 00:13:55.987
was brought there to use for moving the corpse.

242
00:13:55.987 --> 00:13:58.887
The knapsack that was in the suitcase

243
00:13:58.887 --> 00:14:00.987
was probably what her belongings were in.

244
00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:02.487
The contents were removed,

245
00:14:02.487 --> 00:14:03.887
and only the knapsack was put into the suitcase!

246
00:14:04.387 --> 00:14:05.887
I see.

247
00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:10.387
In other words, Mr. Hiura secretly sneaks the victim into the room first,

248
00:14:10.387 --> 00:14:12.387
then kills her in the bathroom.

249
00:14:12.387 --> 00:14:14.587
He shoves her into the suitcase naked,

250
00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:19.287
and waits for the editors to finish eating and leave the room.

251
00:14:19.287 --> 00:14:21.687
Then, he lowers the suitcase with her corpse inside

252
00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:24.587
to her room right below.

253
00:14:24.587 --> 00:14:28.387
After this, he hands the manuscripts that were already completed to begin,

254
00:14:28.387 --> 00:14:32.287
one after the other to the editors who were guarding him.

255
00:14:32.287 --> 00:14:35.087
Then, at about 5:30 pm, he says that he's going to think of

256
00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:38.787
how to complete the last page while going out to get cigarettes.

257
00:14:38.787 --> 00:14:41.387
He finally uses the room key

258
00:14:41.387 --> 00:14:43.587
that he stole from the victim to go into her room,

259
00:14:43.587 --> 00:14:45.087
puts the bathrobe on her

260
00:14:45.087 --> 00:14:47.887
and lies her down by the front door.

261
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:48.987
At 6 pm sharp,

262
00:14:48.987 --> 00:14:53.187
the bellboy who was told to deliver the champagne

263
00:14:53.187 --> 00:14:56.887
will find the corpse there!

264
00:14:56.887 --> 00:14:59.687
The beer was spilled on the inside of the suitcase

265
00:14:59.687 --> 00:15:02.687
is used to camouflage any traces of wetness and smell

266
00:15:02.687 --> 00:15:05.187
since he rushed to put the corpse into the suitcase

267
00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:07.587
when her hair was still wet.

268
00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:09.087
I guess he wanted to mask the smell of shampoo

269
00:15:09.087 --> 00:15:11.487
and the suitcase being wet.

270
00:15:11.487 --> 00:15:15.487
But, why didn't he at least dry her hair before putting her inside?

271
00:15:15.487 --> 00:15:17.187
He should've at least had time for that.

272
00:15:17.187 --> 00:15:19.987
He couldn't have!

273
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:24.587
Because if that man makes a sound using a hair dryer,

274
00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:26.387
it would be strange!

275
00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:27.887
I see.

276
00:15:27.887 --> 00:15:29.787
His head is shaved.

277
00:15:29.787 --> 00:15:32.987
Mr. Hiura, took the caps of the shampoo and hair conditioner

278
00:15:32.987 --> 00:15:37.087
from the bathroom of the victim for the same reason.

279
00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:40.387
He probably wanted to replace the caps

280
00:15:40.387 --> 00:15:43.187
since after the victim used them,

281
00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:44.987
she threw the caps down the drain or something.

282
00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:48.987
Because you probably don't use shampoo and stuff.

283
00:15:48.987 --> 00:15:52.387
So, maybe you still have them with you.

284
00:15:52.387 --> 00:15:55.187
The caps of the shampoo and hair conditioner.

285
00:15:57.087 --> 00:16:01.187
Unless you threw them away somewhere on your way here.

286
00:16:05.287 --> 00:16:07.487
Well, even if you did throw them away,

287
00:16:07.487 --> 00:16:11.087
it would be in the trash can of the elevator hall of the floor below,

288
00:16:11.087 --> 00:16:14.487
where the bell girl outfit in a bag was also found.

289
00:16:14.487 --> 00:16:16.687
What? How did he take it there?

290
00:16:16.687 --> 00:16:19.687
Wasn't he empty-handed when he left the room'

291
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.687
He was wearing the outfit

292
00:16:21.687 --> 00:16:24.987
under his clothes that he's wearing now.

293
00:16:24.987 --> 00:16:27.387
He took the outfit off at the landing of the stairs,

294
00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.587
put it in a bag and disposed of it,

295
00:16:29.587 --> 00:16:32.087
before the corpse was found.

296
00:16:32.087 --> 00:16:35.087
So, we should be able to find

297
00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:37.387
the victim's and Mr. Hiura's perspiration,

298
00:16:37.387 --> 00:16:39.587
fragments of skin and fingerprints

299
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:41.987
on the bell girl outfit.

300
00:16:50.987 --> 00:16:54.087
It's really hard to dispose of when needed,

301
00:16:54.087 --> 00:16:57.987
I was scared that somebody may be watching.

302
00:16:57.987 --> 00:17:00.887
Then, you admit to committing the crime?

303
00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:02.287
Yes.

304
00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:06.387
I sent a blackmail fax too, to try to get away with it but...

305
00:17:06.387 --> 00:17:10.187
I guess mysteries are not my cup of tea, after all.

306
00:17:10.187 --> 00:17:12.687
But, why did you kill her?

307
00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:13.987
She was an efficient assistant

308
00:17:13.987 --> 00:17:17.487
and you said that thanks to her you were able to make a comeback!

309
00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:20.187
Yes. Exactly.

310
00:17:20.187 --> 00:17:22.287
Now that I've lost her,

311
00:17:22.287 --> 00:17:24.787
I probably can't write a single line.

312
00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:26.987
Then why?

313
00:17:26.987 --> 00:17:29.287
Don't tell me that she was really your lover

314
00:17:29.287 --> 00:17:31.587
and she pressured you to get a divorce?

315
00:17:31.587 --> 00:17:33.387
Just the opposite.

316
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.587
No matter how many times I approached her,

317
00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:38.787
her answer was always,

318
00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:41.287
"Your wife will scold you."

319
00:17:42.087 --> 00:17:44.487
She took a bath this time too,

320
00:17:44.487 --> 00:17:49.687
because I told her, who was in a bell girl outfit, that she smelled.

321
00:17:49.687 --> 00:17:52.787
-"Telephone, Sea and I" -She came to my room

322
00:17:52.787 --> 00:17:56.087
to talk about the novel.

323
00:17:56.087 --> 00:18:00.387
The last scene of "Telephone, Sea, and I".

324
00:18:00.387 --> 00:18:04.487
Then... She's the one who actually wrote that novel after all

325
00:18:04.487 --> 00:18:06.087
Yes.

326
00:18:06.087 --> 00:18:07.587
That's right.

327
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.787
It's a story that she mainly thought up.

328
00:18:10.787 --> 00:18:13.687
The original material came from an old fan letter too,

329
00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:16.587
so it's more her work than mine at this point.

330
00:18:16.587 --> 00:18:18.087
Fan letter?

331
00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:19.387
Yes.

332
00:18:19.387 --> 00:18:20.787
When I was cleaning,

333
00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:24.287
an old letter that was written by an elementary school student came out.

334
00:18:24.287 --> 00:18:28.387
And, I arranged the story that was enclosed with the letter

335
00:18:28.387 --> 00:18:30.487
by using the name of the sender of that letter,

336
00:18:30.487 --> 00:18:34.287
Jun Ota, as the heroine.

337
00:18:34.287 --> 00:18:37.487
It was since I had told her about this

338
00:18:37.487 --> 00:18:40.987
that she told me that she wanted to decide on the title herself

339
00:18:40.987 --> 00:18:46.087
and also began revising in detail the things that I wrote.

340
00:18:46.087 --> 00:18:50.787
It's true that the novel turned out to be fantastic thanks to her

341
00:18:50.787 --> 00:18:53.687
but, I couldn't understand

342
00:18:53.687 --> 00:18:58.087
why she got so involved in the work.

343
00:18:58.087 --> 00:19:00.687
No matter how many times I asked her,

344
00:19:00.687 --> 00:19:05.487
all she did was smile and say, "you'll eventually find out".

345
00:19:05.487 --> 00:19:10.687
That's when the magazine wrote the scoop scandal of us being lovers.

346
00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:12.687
So I was convinced.

347
00:19:12.687 --> 00:19:15.887
This woman was out to take away my family, my position,

348
00:19:15.887 --> 00:19:18.687
my fame, my money, my everything,

349
00:19:18.687 --> 00:19:21.587
and ready to totally ruin me!

350
00:19:21.587 --> 00:19:24.187
But, why would she do something like that?

351
00:19:24.187 --> 00:19:25.887
I wonder.

352
00:19:25.887 --> 00:19:28.787
I used to fool around a lot when I was young

353
00:19:28.787 --> 00:19:31.787
so she might have held a grudge against me for something.

354
00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:38.387
Well, to be honest, I'm relieved that I was arrested.

355
00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:41.487
I was going to disclose the meaning of

356
00:19:41.487 --> 00:19:44.387
"Telephone, Sea, and I" on the last page

357
00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:48.387
but I killed her before I could ask her about it.

358
00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:49.687
"I love you".

359
00:19:49.687 --> 00:19:51.487
What?

360
00:19:51.487 --> 00:19:55.287
-"Telephone, Sea, I" -Read it backwards, I, Sea, Tel.

361
00:19:55.287 --> 00:19:57.387
If you change it to Japanese phonetics,

362
00:19:57.387 --> 00:20:01.587
you'll get "I Love You".

363
00:20:01.587 --> 00:20:03.887
In other words, the person who sending the cell phone over

364
00:20:03.887 --> 00:20:06.587
from the future in a time machine,

365
00:20:06.587 --> 00:20:10.687
could've been that the heroine's lover or husband.

366
00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:15.087
It couldn't be some childish code like that.

367
00:20:15.087 --> 00:20:16.787
It can't be helped!

368
00:20:16.787 --> 00:20:20.287
It's a code that was thought up by a child to begin with, you see.

369
00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:25.087
In the same way, when you read Chiaki Minazuki,

370
00:20:25.087 --> 00:20:28.087
Minazuki means June in English

371
00:20:28.087 --> 00:20:30.487
and the word "Aki" in Chiaki means autumn.

372
00:20:30.487 --> 00:20:33.587
Read it backwards and you get "June Autumn".

373
00:20:33.587 --> 00:20:36.287
It sounds a lot like Jun Ota, doesn't it?

374
00:20:36.287 --> 00:20:39.587
No... No way...

375
00:20:39.587 --> 00:20:43.487
I see. Jun Ota is her pen name.

376
00:20:43.487 --> 00:20:46.287
If you decipher the code, "Telephone, Sea, and I",

377
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.487
it's obvious you'd be able to figure it out too.

378
00:20:48.487 --> 00:20:50.887
Oh, no.

379
00:20:50.887 --> 00:20:52.987
No way.

380
00:20:56.187 --> 00:21:02.087
If so, maybe all she wanted was for you to grant her dream.

381
00:21:02.087 --> 00:21:07.087
The childhood dream that she entrusted in you.

382
00:21:07.087 --> 00:21:09.187
In the best way possible.

383
00:22:31.587 --> 00:22:34.387
I love you...

384
00:22:34.387 --> 00:22:36.187
I see.

385
00:22:36.187 --> 00:22:39.087
The person who texted her was her future lover.

386
00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:42.087
Yes. Sera said so!

387
00:22:42.087 --> 00:22:45.587
But, it could be that he was a stalker too?

388
00:22:45.587 --> 00:22:47.087
No way!

389
00:22:47.087 --> 00:22:50.787
Don't say things like that and crush my dreams!

390
00:22:56.687 --> 00:22:58.687
What's wrong, Conan?

391
00:22:58.687 --> 00:23:00.087
Oh, no.

392
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:02.187
It's nothing.

393
00:23:07.287 --> 00:23:08.987
A wiretap.

394
00:23:10.287 --> 00:23:13.987
The stuff that's on the tip of the bow of his glasses.

395
00:23:13.987 --> 00:23:15.787
Have to be careful.

396
00:23:15.787 --> 00:23:17.787
A type I've never seen before.

397
00:23:18.987 --> 00:23:21.087
Judging from the size of the battery,

398
00:23:21.087 --> 00:23:23.987
it operates only for a very short time.

399
00:23:25.387 --> 00:23:28.087
This form and this performance...

400
00:23:28.087 --> 00:23:30.087
Quite interesting.

401
00:23:31.187 --> 00:23:33.987
How about it? Do you like him?

402
00:23:33.987 --> 00:23:36.987
I'm far from trusting him yet, though.

403
00:23:36.987 --> 00:23:40.887
But, if he gets impatient and asks about me,

404
00:23:40.887 --> 00:23:42.787
tell him this,

405
00:23:46.187 --> 00:23:49.987
I'm your younger sister from another domain.

406
00:23:51.787 --> 00:23:54.087
We all came to Kanazawa.

407
00:23:54.087 --> 00:23:59.587
So, you want to challenge the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

408
00:23:59.587 --> 00:24:01.487
I'll accept the challenge.

409
00:24:03.887 --> 00:24:05.987
Thief!

410
00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:12.787
Don't you noticed anything?

411
00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:16.787
Next Conan,

412
00:24:16.787 --> 00:24:20.887
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kanazawa Part)"

413
00:24:36.287 --> 00:24:38.387
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:38.387 --> 00:24:40.887
"Shoulder bag".

415
00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:42.587
We're all going to Kanazawa next week.

416
00:24:42.587 --> 00:24:43.787
I'm looking forward to going to Kaga Hot Springs

417
00:24:43.787 --> 00:24:44.887
Don't cause any incidents, okay.

418
00:24:44.887 --> 00:24:45.987
Yes, sir.
