1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,340
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
Tonight, we solve the case involving the super car.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,840
No one's ever seen anything like it before.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,399
We have come to the Izu Highlands after winning first prize

9
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,399
in the neighborhood association's drawing

10
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,699
which was a one night's stay in a hotel here.

11
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,399
The owner of the hotel turns out to be a real car buff

12
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,299
and a historic car show is opening at the hotel the following day.

13
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,199
The guests that show up though, all have had their valuable cars

14
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,999
taken away by the owner through deceitful methods.

15
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,299
That night, the owner of the hotel goes for a late night drive

16
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,599
and the next morning,

17
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,699
he is found dead in the driver's seat of his car!

18
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:37,299
"The Super Car's Trap (Part 2)"

19
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,899
What do you think, doctor?

20
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,199
The cause of death is probably

21
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,699
carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the exhaust fumes.

22
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,699
And I see no other external injuries.

23
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:02,899
The estimated time of death is between 9.00 am and 10.00 am.

24
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:05,299
That's right, he was still alive

25
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,699
when I called him on his cellular a little past 9.00 am.

26
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,299
You talked to him?

27
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,299
How did he sound?

28
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,499
He sounded like he was in pain and he said

29
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:16,299
"Where am I?" and "It's pitch dark",

30
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:19,199
gibberish like that.

31
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,399
I guess the carbon monoxide was making him delirious.

32
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:26,599
That means he must've died right after you called.

33
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,399
Excuse me, Detective Yokomizo,

34
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:34,199
doesn't that mean Mr. Teraizumi was here way before 9.00 am?

35
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,199
Of course, you nincompoop!

36
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,799
By the way, Mr. Mouri.

37
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,999
About the window on the driver's side,

38
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:42,599
why do you think it's slightly open?

39
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,699
Survival instinct!

40
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,199
The exhaust fumes were suffocating him

41
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,599
and he must've opened it in desperation.

42
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,199
But why did he die then?

43
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,999
Because by the time he got the window open,

44
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,099
it was too late.

45
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,999
What is this?

46
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:08,199
It breaks off straight across.

47
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,499
Hey, you there.

48
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,299
You shouldn't be wandering around here!

49
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,999
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,199
I was just wondering what this black stain was.

51
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,699
That's coal tar, it's made when fuel is imperfectly combusted.

52
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,799
It dripped out of the muffler.

53
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,399
It happens a lot in these old cars.

54
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,299
Gee, but it looks so shiny and new.

55
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,999
Yeah, it's been polished so good,

56
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,899
there's hardly any fingerprints on it.

57
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,299
What is it? Is something wrong?

58
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:42,299
It seems this car's been in an accident lately.

59
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,699
There's a crack in the left head lamp

60
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,799
and we found some fibers in it.

61
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,699
A crack and fibers...

62
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,099
Well, here we are.

63
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,399
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

64
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,599
Let's start right away,

65
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,099
which of you is Mr. Sagara, the one who first discovered the body.

66
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,799
That's me.

67
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:06,599
Will you give us the details of how you found the body?

68
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,899
"Shinsuke Sagara (37)" -I got back from my morning drive

69
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,099
"Car Repair Factory Manager" -a little past 10.00 am

70
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,999
and I was just about to park my car in the parking lot

71
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:16,399
when I nearly crashed into the Dino.

72
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,799
You see, the fog hadn't lifted yet.

73
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:21,099
And when look in the car,

74
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,499
I saw Mr. Teraizumi slumped in the driver's seat.

75
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,999
Is there anything else you noticed?

76
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,299
Now that you mention it,

77
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:31,599
I saw all these other people all gathered near the parking lot.

78
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,799
That was my fault.

79
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,899
What do you mean, Ran?

80
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,899
Ran let out this loud scream that scared us,

81
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,499
so we all ran out to see what was up.

82
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:42,799
The fog was so thick I couldn't see

83
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:46,299
and when the security guard called out to me, it scared me.

84
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:47,699
I see.

85
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,199
By the way, about the late Mr. Teraizumi,

86
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,099
we assume he returned from his drive

87
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,999
and sat in his car with the engine running

88
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,599
and died from carbon monoxide inhalation.

89
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,499
Does anyone know why he would sit in his car

90
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,599
with the engine running?

91
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,999
"Zenkichi Kuroiwa (45)" -The truth is, Mr. Teraizumi loved that car

92
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:11,599
"Hotel Manager" -more than anything, why just yesterday...

93
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,799
Sir, the other cars are already in their places.

94
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,799
Why don't you take yours there now?

95
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,699
Hold it, just one minute, don't rush me.

96
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,999
I want to spend tonight with "my friend"!

97
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,499
Once it's on display,

98
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:28,899
I won't be able to take it for a spin whenever I feel like it.

99
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,199
I guess that's why he couldn't tear himself away from his beloved car

100
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,599
after he got back from his drive.

101
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,399
I see, and then he must have fallen asleep.

102
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,399
Mr. Teraizumi was really looking forward

103
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,499
to the opening of the show room today.

104
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,799
I feel so sorry for him.

105
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,799
You can stop the charade now, Mr. Kuroiwa.

106
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:53,299
Tell us the truth, you're relieved he's dead, aren't you?

107
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,499
What are you talking about?

108
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,099
I know all about it,

109
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,799
Mr. Teraizumi was just about to lay you off.

110
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,799
You were being laid off? Is that true?

111
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,999
Yes, it is true.

112
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,699
But I didn't hate him!

113
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,899
Not like these men here!

114
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,499
What do you mean by that?

115
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,799
They all hated him!

116
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,199
They had their precious cars taken away by Mr. Teraizumi

117
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
when they couldn't repay their debts.

118
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,999
And don't forget the threatening letter!

119
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,699
A threatening letter?

120
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,499
Oh, that was nothing but a prank.

121
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,899
"Don't open the show room or you'll be sorry."

122
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,799
But this could mean his death was a murder.

123
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,699
A murder?

124
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,699
How can kill you someone by carbon monoxide poisoning?

125
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,299
But you see, Mr. Mouri...

126
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:44,499
Detective Yokomizo?

127
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,399
Mr. Kogoro always says that

128
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,399
the most important thing is everyone's alibi, isn't that right?

129
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,699
Yes, you're right, Conan.

130
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,699
Well, does anyone have anything to say?

131
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,199
"Ichirou Ootake (55)" -When that private detective over there

132
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,499
Jouji Kameoka (40) -called Mr. Teraizumi,

133
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:57,599
he was still alive, wasn't he?

134
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
We were all with that detective after that.

135
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,899
That's right, the only ones missing

136
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,299
were Mr. Sagara and Suguro over there.

137
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,299
Eh? Are you talking about me?

138
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:12,999
"Hisashi Suguro(28)" -Oh come on, the only time I left everyone

139
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,599
is to prepare for the opening ceremony

140
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,399
and that was for only five minutes, from 10.00 am to 10.05 am.

141
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,999
That's when we heard Ran scream

142
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,199
and we all ran out into the parking lot.

143
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,699
I couldn't have killed him in just five minutes!

144
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,499
You're right about that.

145
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,299
Mr. Sagara, you stated that you were out for a drive.

146
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:40,699
That's right and it was Mr. Sagara who found Mr. Teraizumi dead!

147
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,699
Mr. Sagara! Don't tell me it was you.

148
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:45,399
No, you're wrong! It wasn't me!

149
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,499
I was on the veranda yesterday

150
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,799
and I heard Mr. Sagara talking on the telephone.

151
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,699
Don't worry about it! I'll take care of it!

152
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,499
The opening ceremonies at 3.00 pm tomorrow afternoon.

153
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,199
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

154
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,999
That's right, don't worry.

155
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:06,099
We're going ahead as scheduled, understand?

156
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,099
Do you want to explain, Mr. Sagara?

157
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,899
The truth is, I borrowed some money from a friend.

158
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:17,899
You borrowed money?

159
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,599
Yes. I was going to repay Teraizumi and get my car back

160
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,799
but I figured paying him back wasn't good enough,

161
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,399
I was going to throw the money on his face at the opening ceremony

162
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,599
and put his nose out of joint.

163
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:34,799
That's why I rushed to Tokyo last night to get the money.

164
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,499
If you call my friend, he'll confirm my story.

165
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:43,699
It seems everyone has an alibi.

166
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:46,899
It must have been an accident after all.

167
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,799
Excuse me, detective.

168
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,599
I'd like to put the Dino on display, in memory of Mr. Teraizumi.

169
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,099
Yes, you're right.

170
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,599
We're done inspecting the crime scene,

171
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,699
I guess it'll be all right.

172
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,799
Thank you very much!

173
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,799
If it wasn't Mr. Sagara, I wonder...

174
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,999
Last night, he...

175
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,299
Mr. Kuroiwa, excuse me.

176
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,199
Huh? What is it?

177
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,199
That guy from the crime lab just told me that

178
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,999
the Dino's headlight cover was cracked.

179
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,599
Eh? Is that true? It wasn't there yesterday,

180
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,599
and if Mr. Teraizumi hit something,

181
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:30,299
he'd have made a big fuss and have it get it fixed right away.

182
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,199
I knew it.

183
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:36,899
Mr. Teraizumi hit something when he got back from his drive.

184
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,399
But how did the killer commit the murder?

185
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,799
What was that? Are you sure about that?

186
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,299
Yes, I checked the parking lot a little before 10.00 am

187
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,999
but Mr. Teraizumi's car wasn't there.

188
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,199
But the fog was very thick, maybe you overlooked it.

189
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:59,599
No, I'd never make that mistake.

190
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:02,199
There was another car parked in his space.

191
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,099
Another car?

192
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:07,299
Yes. I didn't get a good look because of the fog,

193
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,499
but I think it was gray.

194
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,399
And I'd never heard that engine before

195
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,099
so I know it wasn't one of our regular guest.

196
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,799
Then the car's engine was running.

197
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,899
Yes, and I'd recognize Mr. Teraizumi's car engine any day.

198
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,099
What does all that mean?

199
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,899
Detective Yokomizo.

200
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,099
Please come with me.

201
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,699
What's up?

202
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:29,999
That's it!

203
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,099
Excuse me, Mr. Noda, at that time, just by chance...

204
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,099
What? Mr. Sagara did what?

205
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:37,299
Yes, he said he'd repaid the money he owed

206
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,999
so he was taking his car back right now.

207
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,299
Darn, we've already got our hands full!

208
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,799
-Let's go! -Yes, sir!

209
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,099
How'd you know that, kid?

210
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,899
So I'm right!

211
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,999
Yes, you sure are, kid!

212
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,699
Now I know everything!

213
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,499
I know why the tar was broken off straight across

214
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:03,199
and why that gray car was in the parking lot!

215
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,099
And I've solved the mystery of the cracked headlight and the fiber!

216
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,799
I have all the answers now.

217
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,899
He's the killer!

218
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,488
Stop it, Mr. Sagara!

219
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,588
You can't do this!

220
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,288
What do you mean?

221
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:25,588
I just paid the money back, didn't I?

222
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,788
I'm taking my car back no matter what you say!

223
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,688
Wait a minute, Mr. Sagara!

224
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,588
What's going on here?

225
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,988
I'm glad you're here.

226
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,988
Mr. Sagara insists on leaving with his car.

227
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,888
We can't allow that.

228
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:44,588
You have to stay here until we've cleared everyone.

229
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:47,688
What do you mean, wasn't it an accident?

230
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,988
Well, it appears it may not have been.

231
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,888
Did you find something?

232
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,788
When the security guard Mr. Noda

233
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,988
checked the parking lot a little before 10.00 am,

234
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,688
instead of Mr. Teraizumi's car,

235
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:03,988
he claims that he saw a gray car parked in his spot.

236
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,888
What? That means...

237
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,688
Oh boy. Here we go again...

238
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,388
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

239
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,088
Mr. Mouri...

240
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:16,288
I've finally figured everything out, Detective Yokomizo.

241
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:20,188
What you just said confirmed it all.

242
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:21,788
What do you mean?

243
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:25,188
Mr. Teraizumi's death was not an accident.

244
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,488
It was pre-meditated murder!

245
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,588
Detective Yokomizo,

246
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:37,288
before I start explaining how the crime was committed,

247
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,588
I'd like you to prepare something.

248
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:42,088
I understand. What do you need?

249
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,888
First, could you call Mr. Noda, the security guard here?

250
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,488
-Go on. -Yes, sir!

251
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:49,388
And another thing,

252
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:52,788
I need a large vinyl sheet if possible.

253
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:56,888
One like the kind they use to cover cars.

254
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,288
A car cover.

255
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,088
If it's one of those, Suguro,

256
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:04,788
your car in the parking lot is always covered, isn't it?

257
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,588
Yes.

258
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:10,888
You have one? Do you mind lending it to us?

259
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:13,588
Sure, no problem.

260
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:25,188
Now that everything is ready, let us begin.

261
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:28,788
When Mr. Teraizumi got back from his drive,

262
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:30,688
the killer used a sleeping drug to put him to sleep,

263
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:33,288
then put him behind the wheel of the Dino

264
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,688
and left him there with the engine running.

265
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:39,288
That leaves me out.

266
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:43,288
When I left for Tokyo,

267
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:46,988
Mr. Teraizumi wasn't back yet!

268
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,888
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

269
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,488
What?

270
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:55,388
No one saw Mr. Teraizumi return.

271
00:14:55,388 --> 00:15:00,088
So can you prove he didn't get back before you left?

272
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,388
How dare you?

273
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:03,088
Just calm down.

274
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:05,188
Let me remind you, Mr. Mouri,

275
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:06,888
when Mr. Noda, the security guard

276
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,888
made his rounds shortly before the body was found,

277
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:13,588
he claims Mr. Teraizumi's car was not in the parking lot.

278
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:16,388
But in truth, it was already there

279
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:19,388
when Mr. Noda checked the parking lot.

280
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:22,888
He's already stated there was a gray car in that space.

281
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:27,488
And that car was Mr. Teraizumi's!

282
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,388
What was that?

283
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:33,088
But still... Mr. Noda said the engine wasn't Mr. Teraizumi's.

284
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,588
Yes.

285
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:38,088
That engine wasn't Mr. Teraizumi's Dino.

286
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:40,388
It was another car!

287
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,288
All right, Detective Yokomizo,

288
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,788
turn the ignition on.

289
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:47,588
All right.

290
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:48,688
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,388
Mr. Mouri, the engine's running.

292
00:15:57,388 --> 00:16:00,388
Okay, how about it, Mr. Noda?

293
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:04,488
It's not the same,

294
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,888
that's not the car I heard in the parking lot.

295
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:09,188
Now, Detective Yokomizo,

296
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:14,188
could you cover the Dino with that cover?

297
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,188
This cover?

298
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,288
Yes.

299
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,688
All right. Mr. Noda,

300
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,888
listen very carefully.

301
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:23,988
All right.

302
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:37,288
This is it! This is the engine I heard!

303
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,888
Are you sure?

304
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:42,688
But why cover the car?

305
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:45,488
I've got it! That's why the window...

306
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:49,388
That's right! That's why the window was down

307
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:52,888
so that the exhaust fumes would enter the car!

308
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:58,188
After the killer put Mr. Teraizumi to sleep,

309
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:00,288
he lowered the window

310
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:03,388
then covered the car

311
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,888
and anchored it down securely

312
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:09,688
so that the fumes wouldn't escape.

313
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:11,788
Does everyone remember

314
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:16,188
Mr. Teraizumi's last words over the telephone?

315
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,088
Hello, Mr. Teraizumi?

316
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:27,688
It's me, Mouri. Where are you?

317
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,788
Where am I?

318
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:32,188
It's... it's pitch black.

319
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:35,288
Pitch black?

320
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,388
I've got it!

321
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:41,488
Mr. Teraizumi said it was dark because the car was covered!

322
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,688
That's right.

323
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:49,288
And the exhaust fumes trapped under the cover

324
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,088
entered the car through the open window

325
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,988
causing him to die of carbon monoxide poisoning.

326
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,688
Then the killer waited until the right moment,

327
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,388
returned to the car and took the cover off

328
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:04,288
leaving us with what he thought to be the perfect crime.

329
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:09,388
But then something the killer didn't anticipate occurred!

330
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,088
And what was that?

331
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:17,888
One, Mr. Noda saw the car with the cover on!

332
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,288
It was coincidence

333
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:23,188
that you went to the parking lot at that time, wasn't it?

334
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:26,588
Yes, Mr. Kuroiwa had asked me to look for Mr. Teraizumi,

335
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,988
that's why I went there.

336
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:32,088
The second thing was Ran's scream.

337
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:34,088
Huh, my scream?

338
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:39,188
Yes, I'm sure the killer had gone to take the cover off,

339
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:42,888
but when Ran screamed, he got scared

340
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,188
and forgot to close the window!

341
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:48,788
Which means, that the killer

342
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,488
is the person who arrived last to where Ran was.

343
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:03,088
Suguro, it was you!

344
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,288
Suguro...

345
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,688
You can't be serious.

346
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:15,588
Just because I arrived late when your daughter screamed,

347
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,188
don't make me out to be the killer.

348
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:21,488
Suguro, explain the stain on your trousers.

349
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:27,888
The stain is from the wine you spilled on them last night.

350
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:29,988
That's right,

351
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:34,988
but when you brought the room service order to our room...

352
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:38,988
I'm very sorry about ruining your pants earlier.

353
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:43,388
No problem, it was nothing. I changed right away.

354
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:47,388
So why did you change back into a pair of stained trousers?

355
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,488
That's none of your business.

356
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,688
The head lamp on Mr. Teraizumi's car

357
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:57,888
was cracked and some fiber was stuck to it!

358
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:00,888
When Mr. Teraizumi returned,

359
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:04,588
you stopped his car and it accidentally hit your knee

360
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:08,388
and it tore your trousers, didn't it?

361
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:12,988
You're just making everything up.

362
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:16,988
Mr. Noda, when you saw the strange car in the parking lot,

363
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:19,888
why didn't you check it out?

364
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:24,088
Well, Suguro told me to check the front entrance.

365
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,388
He's lying!

366
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:28,488
Please check under Suguro's car cover,

367
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:31,388
look at the part that goes over the muffler,

368
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:35,588
you should find some black liquid on it!

369
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,988
Some time has past, hasn't it?

370
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:43,588
I found it! A black stain just like you said, Mr. Mouri!

371
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,588
At the scene of the crime,

372
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:49,788
we found stains from the tar that flowed out of the Dino's muffler.

373
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:53,388
It looked like it was cut off straight across,

374
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:56,788
as if it had been blocked off!

375
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,688
I'm sure when we have it analyzed,

376
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:02,288
we'll find the composition of the stains are identical.

377
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,788
What have you got to say, Katssuro?

378
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:07,388
Are you going to insist you're innocent?

379
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:15,088
Okay, you got me! I killed Teraizumi!

380
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:18,988
That Dino was once my car.

381
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:22,588
But he cheated me out of it!

382
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:25,688
You killed him over something like that.

383
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:27,588
Something like that?

384
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:31,688
Don't put me in the same boat as those rich good for nothings!

385
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:34,388
That car was about to be scrapped when I got it,

386
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:37,188
I sacrificed my food money and worked hard on it

387
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:39,088
to get it looking like it does now.

388
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,488
And then Teraizumi comes along and...

389
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:16,188
Getting there was so much fun

390
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:20,288
but when it comes time to leave, all the fight's gone.

391
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:23,088
Like they say, getting there is half the fun but leaving is horrible.

392
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:24,288
I guess we should have take

393
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:27,188
the "eat all you can Shabu shabu" dinner after all.

394
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:32,688
Hey dad, maybe we should have asked Detective Yokomizo to drive us.

395
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:40,788
That rat! He didn't even offer!

396
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,888
Are you coming down with a cold, sir?

397
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,688
I don't know, I suddenly felt a chill.

398
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:49,688
Take care of yourself.

399
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:51,088
I've never caught a cold

400
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:52,288
Really?

401
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:57,288
I'm never going to help you again!

402
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:03,788
Even Eri's crazy about younger guys these days.

403
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:06,688
"Next Episode" -Mom!

404
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:08,688
I can't find dad!

405
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:12,188
He's not in our room or in any of the other 3 people's rooms!

406
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,288
What's going on?

407
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:22,988
Dad?

408
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:28,509
Next Conan, "Kogoro Mouri, Suspect (Part 1)"

409
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,406
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:33,606
"Chain lock"

411
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,506
No one wants to get involved in the fracas of the next episode.

412
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:38,506
Dad, I don't believe, I just can't...
