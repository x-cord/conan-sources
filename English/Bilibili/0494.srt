1
00:00:01.524 --> 00:00:03.524
In order to confirm whether Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke's older sister

2
00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.924
are one and the same person,

3
00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:07.824
we go and visit the Okudaira residence

4
00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.524
where his mother used to work as a housekeeper.

5
00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:12.024
We get hold of Eisuke's mother's belongings,

6
00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:13.524
including a mother-child booklet.

7
00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:16.224
From these things and Mrs. Okudaira,

8
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.824
we find out that Rena and Eisuke's older sister

9
00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:19.824
are two different people.

10
00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.924
In the meantime, at the Okudaira residence,

11
00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:23.624
a year ago, the oldest son of this family, Tango

12
00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:26.124
had been killed by someone

13
00:00:26.124 --> 00:00:27.824
and a year later today,

14
00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:31.324
the head of this household, Kakuzo is also found dead.

15
00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:34.024
At his feet, a blood smeared book with the title,

16
00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:37.224
"Murderer from the Land of the Dead" is found.

17
00:00:38.324 --> 00:00:42.324
At any rate, if this is a dying message,

18
00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:49.324
your husband Kakuzo

19
00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:55.524
had to have been killed by one of you in this house.

20
00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.224
Sizzling hot suspense.

21
00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:18.724
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

22
00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.624
The case is finally solved!

23
00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.924
Who is the murderer from the Land of the Dead?

24
00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:24.224
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:25.924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:28.124
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.980
"Red and Black Crash: Hades"

28
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.880
I guess I'll start by asking you some questions!

29
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.080
Before he was found,

30
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.580
where was your husband and what was he doing?

31
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.280
Oh, yes.

32
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.280
I showed Detective Mouri to the living room,

33
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.880
and after that...

34
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.580
I was planning to show him the pool but,

35
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.480
it started to rain

36
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.380
so I left that up to Kikuyo

37
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.480
who just happened to come back from shopping,

38
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.780
and went to serve my husband his coffee.

39
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.280
Where did you go shopping?

40
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880
I went to the supermarket in the neighborhood

41
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.280
to get some cream to put inside Mr. Okudaira's coffee.

42
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.980
Oh, I have the the receipt I received too.

43
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.080
See.

44
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.680
I see.

45
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.580
And, how was Mr. Okudaira when you took him the coffee?

46
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.280
I was going to take it to him,

47
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.480
but the coffee server that was supposed to be in the kitchen was gone.

48
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.280
Oh, the coffee server that was supposed to be in the kitchen was gone,

49
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.880
and here instead?

50
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.780
I left to go shopping leaving the coffee server in the kitchen, though.

51
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.280
Which means, that between the time you, Kikuyo left to go shopping

52
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.980
and while Mrs. Okudaira was with me,

53
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.280
somebody put a sleeping drug inside the coffee server

54
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.580
that was left in the kitchen,

55
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.480
and you took it to your husband.

56
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.780
What? I didn't do it!

57
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.180
I was cleaning Tango's car, and after I finished,

58
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.380
I went to the living room where everyone was.

59
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.880
That was when I heard the vase crack.

60
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.880
He was definitely with us when we heard the crack.

61
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.080
I see.

62
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.580
And who's Tango?

63
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.680
He is Mr. Okudaira's oldest son

64
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.080
who was killed here by the pool a year ago.

65
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.380
I was summoned here to unravel the case of a year ago.

66
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.580
I see.

67
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.780
But, that man was really looking forward to hearing Pop's deduction!

68
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.580
See! It's written on this memo sheet,

69
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.980
deduction show of the Sleeping Kogoro from 4:00 pm today.

70
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.780
Ow, ouch.

71
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.080
I tell you brat, going around sniffing around again.

72
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.380
In other words,

73
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.080
Mr. Okudaira was hoping that the incident of a year ago

74
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.380
would be solved at about sundown today,

75
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.780
and was trying to gather everyone in this house.

76
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.980
If so, the more it is unlikely that he committed suicide.

77
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.880
I guess you can say so.

78
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.180
This is...

79
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.880
a trace that it was wet.

80
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.880
Coffee?

81
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.380
The table top is clean.

82
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.880
There is no trace of coffee having spilt.

83
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.680
This means...

84
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.380
My god, though. What is with this stack of books?

85
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.680
Was he going all out cleaning out the room or something?

86
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.980
No, the large books that my husband ordered arrived today

87
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.180
and he moved the other books

88
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.880
to make space for the books that newly arrived.

89
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.680
I see and... where are those large books?

90
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.380
Well...

91
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.980
It's that book over there.

92
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.780
It sure is large.

93
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.680
But, why is the book that just arrived on the floor near the door?

94
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.680
Maybe the culprit put it there for some reason?

95
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.780
Like to carry out some kind of trick or something.

96
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.280
You're Eisuke Hondo, if I remember correctly?

97
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.580
What brings you here?

98
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.180
Yes, my mother used to work as a housekeeper here.

99
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.980
I got a call saying that her belongings were found

100
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.380
so I came to get then.

101
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.980
Your mother passed away?

102
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.580
Yes, about ten years ago.

103
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.180
A picture of her back then is...

104
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.880
Oh, I tripped by the pool and changed clothes.

105
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.180
I put those clothes in the washing machine a while ago.

106
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.180
There was no picture in the pockets.

107
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.980
What?

108
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.380
Don't tell me you dropped it when you tripped a while ago.

109
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.080
My mother's picture.

110
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.580
Be careful.

111
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.780
Yes, I know.

112
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.680
Gee, I told you to be careful!

113
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.180
Ouch.

114
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.180
Here. I'll hold the picture for you.

115
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.680
Oh, thanks! Please do.

116
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.480
I see, so that's the story.

117
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.080
Oh, don't lose the picture, okay?

118
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.680
Don't worry! I wrapped it in my handkerchief and put it away!

119
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.880
Here, tissue paper. Your face is soiled.

120
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.880
Oh, thank you.

121
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.180
We've got to do something about you being such a blooper.

122
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.080
Or else your sister will be shocked when you found her.

123
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.780
It's all right.

124
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.780
But, nothing's new about me being unlucky so,

125
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.280
I think that in my older sister's eyes,

126
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.380
Eisuke equals an unreliable younger brother.

127
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.180
I see. So, that's the story.

128
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.580
Conan? Where are you going?

129
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580
To Pop's!

130
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.780
Did you find something out again?

131
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.780
Yeah, I sure did.

132
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.580
I've figured out who the ruthless killer is.

133
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.580
The killer from the Land of the Dead!

134
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.980
This is undoubtedly a dying message

135
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.080
left behind by Mr. Okudaira.

136
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.180
The meaning is Greek.

137
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.480
I'm sure it's just coincidental.

138
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.480
It could be that he just bit his lip right before he died

139
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.480
because he was really vexed,

140
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.880
and the blood that dripped just happened to look like a message.

141
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.580
Just a coincidence.

142
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.080
If that book is a dying message,

143
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.180
does that mean that the killer is among us here after all?

144
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.980
No, your husband committed suicide.

145
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.180
Please think it over well.

146
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.180
When the housekeeper and steward

147
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.380
heard the vase crack rushed over to the room,

148
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.180
and was about to open the door

149
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.780
when Mr. Okudaira shouted from inside.

150
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.780
This means he was still alive at that time.

151
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.580
Moreover, when they did open the door,

152
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.780
they say that his body was still swaying,

153
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.980
so there's probably no mistake in thinking that he committed suicide.

154
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.980
As for the vase, he didn't want anyone else to have it,

155
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.080
so he cracked it before he killed himself.

156
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.180
Then, what did he use as a steps tool?

157
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.780
He probably stacked the books that are scattered all over the floor up

158
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.780
and used them as a step stool...

159
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.280
Is Mr. Mouri all right?

160
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.480
Yes, most probably.

161
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.980
It's finally come.

162
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.780
Yes, I've finally realized

163
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.980
by my own words, "stack the books up."

164
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.480
I've figured out the truth about

165
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.080
the ruthless trick that was carried out in this room.

166
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.380
As well as the fact that the killer who committed the murder

167
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.780
is among the three who are here too.

168
00:11:13.533 --> 00:11:15.833
You're saying that Mr. Okudaira did not commit suicide

169
00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:18.433
but was killed?

170
00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:20.933
Right, Inspector Megure.

171
00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:22.933
As usual, he's saying the exact opposite

172
00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:24.633
of what he just said a while ago.

173
00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.833
Let's carry out the trick

174
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:29.533
that made Mr. Okudaira's death look like suicide.

175
00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:30.933
Officer Takagi!

176
00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:33.933
First of all, please put that cart right under the place

177
00:11:33.933 --> 00:11:35.633
where Mr. Okudaira is suspended in air.

178
00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:37.133
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:45.233
Then stack up the books that are scattered around about a meter high

180
00:11:45.233 --> 00:11:46.933
and sit on it.

181
00:11:46.933 --> 00:11:48.433
You want me to sit on it?

182
00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:51.133
Oh, and make sure the books stay in place.

183
00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:54.433
Oh, okay.

184
00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:08.133
I'm sitting down on it.

185
00:12:08.133 --> 00:12:11.333
Then, Inspector Megure, please close the door

186
00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:13.433
and line the remaining books up lengthwise

187
00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:16.833
from the tires of the cart to the door.

188
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:23.133
Like this?

189
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:29.533
Yes. Then, please put the large book in the foreground of the door.

190
00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:30.833
That one?

191
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.533
Because the book that was closest to the door

192
00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:35.933
when the body was found was that one.

193
00:12:35.933 --> 00:12:38.133
All done.

194
00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:43.733
Well, this is the way the rope was put around Mr. Okudaira's neck.

195
00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:47.133
Now all that was needed to be done was for someone to open the door.

196
00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:50.033
It... it's heavy.

197
00:12:50.033 --> 00:12:53.833
But, if you open the door exerting a bit of strength,

198
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.933
the books will be pushed by the door and move.

199
00:12:55.933 --> 00:12:57.333
The book will in turn push the cart,

200
00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.033
and Mr. Okudaira who is on top of the stack of books

201
00:12:59.033 --> 00:13:01.433
on the moving cart will lose balance

202
00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:04.133
and slide down from the stack of books.

203
00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:06.833
And, Mr. Okudaira's body

204
00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:08.733
would be hanging with the rope around his neck

205
00:13:08.733 --> 00:13:11.333
like when you found him.

206
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.633
I see.

207
00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:15.833
But, no matter if he was made to sit on the stack of books,

208
00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:17.033
he could've removed the rope that was around his neck

209
00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:18.433
with both his hands, no?

210
00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:22.233
But, glue was stuck on to the part connecting the rope,

211
00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:24.533
so that it wouldn't come off easily.

212
00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:28.733
But, didn't you remove that rope when you were getting the body down?

213
00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:31.333
Yes, if Mr. Okudaira took his time and went about it carefully,

214
00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:34.833
he may have been able to remove it without losing his balance.

215
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.433
But, it seems he couldn't do so.

216
00:13:37.433 --> 00:13:40.033
He wasn't able to use both his hands.

217
00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:41.533
Couldn't use both hands?

218
00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:45.233
But, there were no traces of the hands being tied on the corpse.

219
00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:49.033
More accurately, I would say both his hands were full.

220
00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:51.033
Just what do you mean?

221
00:13:51.033 --> 00:13:54.733
He was holding the vase he treasured

222
00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:57.833
with both hands behind his back.

223
00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:07.033
Please look at the mouth of the vase that is on the floor.

224
00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:09.233
As proof that he was made to hold the vase

225
00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:11.333
until both his hands started to perspire

226
00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.233
the vase is a bit glossy, isn't it?

227
00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:14.633
True.

228
00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:17.033
But, no matter how much the vase meant to him,

229
00:14:17.033 --> 00:14:20.033
won't he let it go if he's life is in danger?

230
00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:23.233
If he lets go, what would happen to the vase?

231
00:14:23.233 --> 00:14:25.133
It would fall to the floor and crack.

232
00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:27.433
What'll happen to the vase if it cracks?

233
00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.533
Of course a loud sound will be heard and...

234
00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:33.233
I get it! If a loud sound is heard, someone will run over,

235
00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.233
the door would be opened and he would be hung.

236
00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:42.633
Yeah. That's why Mr. Okudaira shouted, "Don't open the door!"

237
00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:44.133
I see!

238
00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.633
But, how did the killer get out of the room

239
00:14:46.633 --> 00:14:48.633
after setting up the trick?

240
00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:50.433
Well, please take a look.

241
00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:52.533
Hey, Conan, do it.

242
00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:54.433
Okay, I got it.

243
00:14:55.433 --> 00:14:57.933
First, you open the door,

244
00:14:57.933 --> 00:15:01.933
then you lean the book against the door that is open,

245
00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:03.933
sneak out of the space between the door

246
00:15:03.933 --> 00:15:06.433
and close the door gently.

247
00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:11.233
So, that's how!

248
00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:15.133
This way, it can be made to look like suicide.

249
00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:19.133
But it's still difficult to track the killer down.

250
00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:20.333
True.

251
00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:22.233
Then, can you figure out

252
00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:25.433
why only the book in front of the door is large?

253
00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:26.833
What do you mean why?

254
00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:30.033
The killer had to open a large space using the large book

255
00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:33.433
in order to get through the door.

256
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.433
And, that killer is...

257
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:43.533
you, housekeeper Kikuyo, isn't it?

258
00:15:43.533 --> 00:15:45.933
No way, Kikuyo couldn't have!

259
00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:51.333
But, Kikuyo was out shopping for milk to put in the coffee at that time.

260
00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:53.733
She probably went to buy it after committing the murder.

261
00:15:53.733 --> 00:15:55.833
As for the coffee, probably knowing that she would be asked to serve it,

262
00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:58.733
she prepared it beforehand.

263
00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:05.233
Yes. Kikuyo put a sleeping drug in the coffee

264
00:16:05.233 --> 00:16:07.033
and put Mr. Okudaira to sleep

265
00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:10.333
after letting him sit on the stack of books that she piled up.

266
00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:14.433
She then put the rope around his neck, gluing on the connecting part

267
00:16:14.433 --> 00:16:16.533
then abruptly woke him up,

268
00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:19.733
after which she made him hold the vase on his hands behind his back.

269
00:16:19.733 --> 00:16:22.133
She threatened him saying that if he didn't hold the vase,

270
00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:23.733
it would drop right away, crack, the books would collapse,

271
00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.333
and the rope would eventually choke him to death.

272
00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:28.633
She then leaves the room in the way I explained a while ago,

273
00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:31.133
rushed over to the room when the sound of the vase cracking was heard

274
00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:33.133
and forced the door open.

275
00:16:33.133 --> 00:16:36.233
At the same time, in order to conceal her trick,

276
00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:38.033
she pretended to stop Mrs. Okudaira

277
00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:42.233
by tripping over the books on the floor.

278
00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:45.533
It sure is a well prepared and ruthless way of killing someone.

279
00:16:45.533 --> 00:16:48.833
Yes, he didn't have a chance, if he got tired and dropped the vase,

280
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:51.433
he dies, neither could he call someone for help.

281
00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:55.133
Yes, this ruthless murder method is exactly the same

282
00:16:55.133 --> 00:16:57.333
as the method of murder that was committed here

283
00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:59.633
at the pool a year ago, of Tango, his son,

284
00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:04.033
who was drowned to death by the killer!

285
00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:07.433
Are you saying that there was a trick to that murder too?

286
00:17:07.433 --> 00:17:10.433
Yes. Only the pool trick was simpler

287
00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:14.033
because all that needed to be done was to tie both his legs and hands,

288
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:18.033
cover his mouth with masking tape and throw him into the pool.

289
00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:21.133
-Throw him inside? -What trick involved is there?

290
00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:24.633
His son's height was almost the same as Eisuke.

291
00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:26.333
The water stain left in the pool

292
00:17:26.333 --> 00:17:30.233
was at just about the position of where Eisuke's eyebrow is,

293
00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:33.533
so if he tiptoed, he could keep his nose out of the water.

294
00:17:33.533 --> 00:17:35.333
The killer probably told Tango,

295
00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:39.933
"If you can hold on for an hour, I'll drain the water of the pool out."

296
00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:41.733
I see, if so,

297
00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:44.233
the son probably tried to keep standing on tiptoe with all his might,

298
00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:47.233
while the killer establishes an alibi.

299
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.933
If he is left as is, he is bound to get tired eventually and drown.

300
00:17:50.933 --> 00:17:53.833
Yeah. Tango was into body building,

301
00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:56.133
so even if he wanted to make his body float,

302
00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:59.233
he couldn't because his muscles were too heavy.

303
00:17:59.233 --> 00:18:02.233
Isn't that right, Kikuyo?

304
00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:06.033
You mean the murderer of the case one year ago

305
00:18:06.033 --> 00:18:07.133
is also the housekeeper?

306
00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:08.433
Yeah, most probably

307
00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:11.833
because the method of making the victim suffer till he dies

308
00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:13.933
is much too similar.

309
00:18:13.933 --> 00:18:17.833
But, you don't have proof that Kikuyo is the murderer, do you?

310
00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:21.133
Mr. Segawa and I could've used that method to kill them too.

311
00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.433
Right.

312
00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:26.233
I think that the greater also serves the smaller.

313
00:18:26.233 --> 00:18:30.633
And besides, if what was found is my husband's dying message,

314
00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:32.233
how does the "Yomi" (Land of the Dead) and the hiragana "ko

315
00:18:32.233 --> 00:18:34.133
connect to Kikuyo?

316
00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:36.133
That's not the hiragana "ko"

317
00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:37.633
but rather, the mathematical symbol meaning equal!

318
00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:39.633
What that message is saying

319
00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:42.133
is that "Yomi" (Land of the Dead) equals "Meido" (Hades).

320
00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:44.033
And so, that lead us to "Maid" (Pronouced as Meido in Japanese).

321
00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:46.933
Therefore, the housekeeper.

322
00:18:48.933 --> 00:18:53.533
Moreover, there is more conclusive evidence than this dying message.

323
00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:57.733
It's inside the right pocket of Kikuyo's apron!

324
00:18:57.733 --> 00:18:59.033
Kikuyo.

325
00:18:59.033 --> 00:19:02.233
You took the tissue that Mrs. Okudaira blew her nose with

326
00:19:02.233 --> 00:19:04.733
and put it in your left pocket, didn't you?

327
00:19:04.733 --> 00:19:08.333
You took the receipt from the supermarket out of the same pocket

328
00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.533
and put it back in there again.

329
00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:11.633
Most people would never put a receipt

330
00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:15.233
that is deemed important in the same pocket with trash in it.

331
00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:19.733
Then, it dawned on me that maybe in your right pocket,

332
00:19:19.733 --> 00:19:20.933
you had something inside that

333
00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:24.233
you didn't want the officers to find out about.

334
00:19:24.233 --> 00:19:25.733
Excuse me.

335
00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:30.733
Inspector! There's a handkerchief

336
00:19:30.733 --> 00:19:33.133
with what looks to be a coffee stain on it.

337
00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:34.933
She gave Mrs. Okudaira who was crying

338
00:19:34.933 --> 00:19:38.433
a piece of tissue paper, instead of her handkerchief.

339
00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:41.833
Although there was a trace of coffee under the table,

340
00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:44.233
the tabletop was clean.

341
00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:47.133
Your husband probably spilt the coffee with sleeping drug in

342
00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:48.233
when drinking it.

343
00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:49.533
She probably wiped the spill with the handkerchief

344
00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:52.933
and still has it in her right pocket.

345
00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:56.433
Okay, send that handkerchief to the forensic section.

346
00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:58.833
If they detect the substance of a sleeping drug on it,

347
00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:01.733
-that will serve as proof. -Yes, sir.

348
00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:04.833
But why, Kikuyo?

349
00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.133
Why would you do something like that?

350
00:20:06.133 --> 00:20:07.433
It probably has something to do

351
00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:10.633
with the accident involving the steward two years ago.

352
00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:13.433
I think that the reason has something to do with Tango

353
00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:16.233
who stopped riding his car around that time.

354
00:20:16.233 --> 00:20:20.033
Nobody's driven his car for two years, right?

355
00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:21.433
No.

356
00:20:21.433 --> 00:20:24.033
Nobody could've ridden it.

357
00:20:24.033 --> 00:20:28.933
Because Tango ran someone over with it.

358
00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:32.433
Back then, Tango was driving a foreign made car

359
00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:36.233
that the previous steward was driving to take Mr. Okudaira places.

360
00:20:36.233 --> 00:20:38.433
After having taken the car out without permission,

361
00:20:38.433 --> 00:20:41.633
he drove around to his heart's content, then ran over a person.

362
00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:43.133
He went crying on his father's shoulder,

363
00:20:43.133 --> 00:20:44.533
who was outraged at the previous steward

364
00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:46.433
for urging Tango to turn himself in.

365
00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:51.633
And two years ago today, his car went over the cliff.

366
00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:56.933
Don't tell me that the accident...

367
00:20:56.933 --> 00:20:59.133
Tango, who I drowned in the pool told me

368
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.233
that he cooperated with his father and got the previous steward drunk,

369
00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:07.033
then made the car over the cliff in order to keep him from talking

370
00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:11.133
as well as to hide the scratch on the car.

371
00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:14.433
Then, you mean, my older brother was killed?

372
00:21:14.433 --> 00:21:16.533
That's why you chose the day

373
00:21:16.533 --> 00:21:19.433
that the previous steward died and killed the two.

374
00:21:19.433 --> 00:21:23.033
How did you find out that it wasn't an accident?

375
00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:27.033
Although the car went over the cliff, he didn't have his gloves on.

376
00:21:27.033 --> 00:21:32.433
He always wore those gloves when he drove,

377
00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:36.233
because I gave it to him as a gift.

378
00:21:48.633 --> 00:21:50.133
Hey, Ran!

379
00:21:50.133 --> 00:21:52.533
We're heading home!

380
00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:54.933
Where the heck is she?

381
00:21:54.933 --> 00:21:59.533
I saw your daughter and the others by the bathroom just a while ago.

382
00:22:00.933 --> 00:22:03.033
Bathroom?

383
00:22:03.033 --> 00:22:04.933
Darn!

384
00:22:04.933 --> 00:22:05.933
Hey.

385
00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:09.933
I tell you! I off my guard about things like this!

386
00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:12.833
Hey, come off it, what a thing to do out of the blue like that!

387
00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.433
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.333
Darn you!

389
00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:20.133
Hi.

390
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.033
What're you doing?

391
00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:26.433
His clothes got dirty so he was changing back to his original clothes.

392
00:22:26.433 --> 00:22:29.733
But, he starting taking them off right in front of me.

393
00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:33.733
But, I used to change in front of my older sister all the time.

394
00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:44.633
Don't tell me he's...

395
00:24:10.633 --> 00:24:13.533
The whereabouts of Eisuke Hondo is unknown?

396
00:24:13.533 --> 00:24:19.733
I hear he found a clue to his father who used to work for the Company.

397
00:24:19.733 --> 00:24:23.033
Don't tell me that aside from the Men in Black,

398
00:24:23.033 --> 00:24:27.233
even the Company is looking for Rena Mizunashi?

399
00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:29.933
The hands of a global organization is closing in on Rena Mizunashi,

400
00:24:29.933 --> 00:24:31.433
who continues to sleep!

401
00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:35.733
Next on Detective Conan,

402
00:24:35.733 --> 00:24:40.033
"Red and Black Crash: Coma"

403
00:24:55.633 --> 00:24:57.633
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:57.633 --> 00:24:59.833
Seven children.

405
00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:01.133
Seven children remind me of the children's song about crows.

406
00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:03.633
-Crows are black. -Black brings to mind the Organization.
