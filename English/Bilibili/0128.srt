1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:03,582
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:05,682
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:07,682
Conan's target finally appears.

4
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:09,782
It smells of a serious crime.

5
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,382
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:13,382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,382
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:59,895
"The Black Organization: One Billion Yen Robbery Case"

9
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,895
Thanks for waiting, Conan.

10
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:17,495
Was the money for detective services deposited?

11
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,695
Yes! Plenty of it.

12
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:23,995
It's even too much that it filled up the entire book.

13
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:25,195
All right!

14
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,895
Let's eat lunch out some place before go home, then.

15
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:30,395
It's been awhile since I've had a drink from day time.

16
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:32,495
Dad.

17
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:35,095
We're talking about lunch.

18
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:39,095
I'll go get this savings book changed for a new one.

19
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:42,395
Gosh. What a hopeless drunkard.

20
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,695
The counter is...

21
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:47,595
What a beauty!

22
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:50,895
-Miss. -Yes!

23
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,195
Would you help this handsome and attractive man

24
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:57,095
change his savings book to a new one?

25
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,395
I'm very sorry, sir.

26
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,595
Please get yourself a number over there,

27
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,595
then please have a seat and wait your turn.

28
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:09,395
Right, we should all wait our turn.

29
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:10,595
Yes.

30
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,995
I'll be right back.

31
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,995
I've got to get a number, a number.

32
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,195
Miss.

33
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:20,095
Oh, Conan.

34
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,395
What's wrong?

35
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:24,395
You seem to be concerned and looking at the clock.

36
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:30,195
I'm a bit busy, so I was hoping that it would be lunch time soon.

37
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:32,095
I'll see you later, Conan.

38
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:35,595
Is she somebody you know, Conan?

39
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,295
Yes, her name is Masami Hirota

40
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:41,095
and she is a new employee who just came here a while ago.

41
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,095
She is usually much kinder.

42
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:50,195
She... she left.

43
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,895
No way.

44
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:57,095
Ran, I think he's going to be in here for quite some time,

45
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,495
so I'll wait outside.

46
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:00,995
Okay, be careful of cars.

47
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,295
It's the parking lot of the bank...

48
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,195
I wonder what that sound was.

49
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,895
They're robbing the armored cash!

50
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,295
There are two robbers.

51
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:29,795
One of them are armed with a shotgun

52
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:32,395
and the other with a gun.

53
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,195
What about the other security guards?

54
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,795
Are they dead?

55
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,895
I can't tell from here.

56
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,695
Conan?

57
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:45,395
What are you doing in a place like this?

58
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,295
We're going home.

59
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,295
Help! It's a robbery!

60
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:55,195
What's with that car?

61
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,095
They're bank robbers!

62
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:58,495
-What? -Ran.

63
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,695
Please call the police.

64
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,795
Hey, Conan!

65
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:01,995
Get an ambulance too,

66
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,495
because there seems to be some people who are hurt!

67
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:06,095
Ran, notify the bank first.

68
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,495
I'll go and check on the people who are hurt.

69
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:08,695
Okay!

70
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,895
Darn it! Talk about high speed.

71
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,395
It's as if we're having a car race.

72
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:20,195
I can barely keep up with them!

73
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,095
Great! A railway crossing!

74
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,595
All right, then!

75
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,595
What the...

76
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:33,395
They are going to run the crossing?

77
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,895
Darn it! I'm not letting them get away!

78
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,395
They got away.

79
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,695
What?

80
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:10,495
One billion yen was stolen?

81
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,795
That's right. All the cash that was supposed to be delivered

82
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,895
from the main bank to all the branches were stolen.

83
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:18,895
One billion...

84
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:23,795
Conan, you're sure of the license plate number you just gave me?

85
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,895
Yes, I'm sure.

86
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:30,195
There are two of them armed with shotgun and a gun.

87
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:34,695
Well, fortunately, the security guard wasn't seriously hurt.

88
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,395
The armored truck stopped,

89
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,395
so we were getting ready to unload the cash.

90
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:41,095
That's when we were suddenly attacked by the robbers...

91
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:49,695
Mr. Koyama? Mr. Murata?

92
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:52,995
Hey, driver! Is somebody there?

93
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,495
Since I got no response from the driver,

94
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:02,995
I thought they were killed

95
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:05,895
and had no choice but to open the door.

96
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:08,895
Strange. I'm sure that back then I...

97
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:12,295
After hearing the gun and the window cracked,

98
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,395
ran right over to the entrance of the parking lot

99
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:16,395
and looked around.

100
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,995
At that time, they were already loading the cash out of the truck.

101
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:24,495
He shouldn't have had any time to call the driver.

102
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,395
You understand too, don't you?

103
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,395
I really had no other choice.

104
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:30,295
Excuse me, sir.

105
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:32,895
You sure are lucky, sir.

106
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:34,695
Huh? Why am I lucky?

107
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:39,295
Because the window of the armored truck is smoked

108
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:41,395
so that you can't see anything from the outside, right?

109
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,395
Right.

110
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,395
The bullet that was fired through that smoked window,

111
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,595
and yet it didn't hit you.

112
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,195
Besides, the bullet hit the coin bag,

113
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,695
so it didn't bounce back at you.

114
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:53,695
You had to either be really lucky

115
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:55,895
or had planned where to place the coin bag

116
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:59,695
and where to hide beforehand, right?

117
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,395
Don't be ridiculous.

118
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:07,295
This is still just a possible deduction.

119
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:09,895
But...

120
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:11,395
Ms. Hirota!

121
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:14,995
Where were you at a time like this?

122
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,995
I'm sorry, I changed shifts and went out for lunch.

123
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:21,095
Talk about the young girls nowadays...

124
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,795
Just what time do you think it is?

125
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,195
Is your watch broken or something?

126
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:29,895
There is one other possibility.

127
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:32,795
Inspector Megure!

128
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,795
What's up, Officer Takagi?

129
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:39,395
There was a report that what looked to be the runaway van was found.

130
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,495
What? Where?

131
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,695
By the riverbed of the Teimutsu River,

132
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:45,995
beside the TR railway bridge.

133
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,895
Okay, let's head off right away.

134
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,595
Come with me too, Mr. Mouri.

135
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,795
Sure!

136
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,895
Ran, you take Conan and go on home.

137
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,195
Okay.

138
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,295
Let's get going then.

139
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:04,095
Conan?

140
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,595
Gosh, he's gone again.

141
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:14,795
So, what's the story, Officer Tome?

142
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,795
Oh, Inspector Megure.

143
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,495
I just took a quick look,

144
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,895
but the fingerprints the runaway van have been wiped off clean.

145
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,095
What other clues are left?

146
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,795
Well, as for pretty large sized clues,

147
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:29,595
there are three cases in the bed of the truck.

148
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:32,495
But there are no fingerprints on them either, and...

149
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:34,995
Hey, bring me the stuff we found a while ago!

150
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:38,295
This was thrown out on the driver's seat.

151
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,795
Oh, thanks.

152
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,395
Take a look at this.

153
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:43,595
These are...

154
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,195
A mask and gloves.

155
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:50,695
Well, although I'm pretty sure we can't expect any prints on them either.

156
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,295
So you're here too, sonny.

157
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:53,395
Sonny?

158
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:54,895
Hello, Officer Tome!

159
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:58,495
Hey! I thought I told you to go on home with Ran!

160
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:02,395
There's something on the inside of the mask.

161
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,395
On the inside of the mask?

162
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:08,695
What's this pink colored soil?

163
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:11,195
This pink color is...

164
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,995
But why?

165
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,295
Okay, then.

166
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:15,495
I'm borrowing this for a while!

167
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,795
Hey!

168
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,595
Just as I thought.

169
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:22,795
It hurts!

170
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,195
You don't "It hurts" me!

171
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,395
What do you think you're doing with the important clues?

172
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,095
That's enough!

173
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:34,195
So, the case started off as an ordinary the others.

174
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:39,195
However, this is no ordinary case of robbery.

175
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:43,495
It didn't take me long to prove that my hunch was right.

176
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:48,384
What? The robber the other day was killed?

177
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:52,384
Yes, a former racer, Jiro Kaizuka was found shot to death in bed.

178
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:58,484
Former racer? No wonder the van was so fast.

179
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,384
How did they figure out that he was the robber?

180
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,284
A memo of the blueprint of the bank,

181
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:06,584
the schedule of the armored cash transport truck,

182
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:12,184
as well as a map of the get away route was found in his room.

183
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:15,084
Furthermore...

184
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:20,084
another person was killed last night with same gun he had.

185
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,584
-What? -Huh?

186
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,784
The security guard, Kishii.

187
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:28,084
Huh? Which means that Mr. Kishii was also a member of the group?

188
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:31,184
I'm sure he was an accomplice.

189
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,484
He liked gambling and seemed to have a lot debts.

190
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,984
He probably played the role of being frightened

191
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:40,584
into opening the rear of the armored truck from the inside.

192
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:43,484
The rear door of an armored truck

193
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,584
cannot be opened unless from the inside.

194
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:52,984
Does that mean that the two were maybe killed by the other robber?

195
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,284
Probably.

196
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,784
Because the money that was stolen is gone.

197
00:12:56,784 --> 00:13:01,184
The other robber probably killed the two to take all the money.

198
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,384
It seems that Inspector Megure

199
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:05,084
is going to check in on things on that line.

200
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,084
But I'm sure that it's only a matter of time before they are caught.

201
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,484
What do you mean?

202
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:14,684
Pink colored lipstick was found in Kaizuka's room.

203
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:16,584
Lipstick?

204
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:17,784
It matched the color

205
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:21,084
that was found on the mask that the robbers left behind.

206
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:22,384
Moreover...

207
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,184
It also matched the color

208
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:27,784
that bank employee Ms. Masami Hirota is using, right?

209
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,584
Conan.

210
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:33,084
One of the her colleagues testified

211
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:38,184
that it matched the color of lipstick she is using.

212
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,484
She left the bank saying she was going out lunch,

213
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:46,384
so I'm sure she went to the back door and joined them.

214
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:49,484
But why would a bank employee do something like that?

215
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:51,384
I don't know.

216
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:56,784
But she has already quit the bank.

217
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:59,084
She handed in a resignation this morning.

218
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,684
What?

219
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:05,884
She started working for this bank only half a year ago.

220
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,184
What do you mean?

221
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:08,584
She just snuck into the bank to check thinks out

222
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:10,284
before committing the crime.

223
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,984
It's more natural if you think of it that way.

224
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:16,084
Well, I guess that how it is.

225
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:17,584
I'm sure...

226
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:20,484
I'm sure things took place on the whole.

227
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,684
But there is still one question left.

228
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:26,984
I wonder if she would really make her lipstick rub off.

229
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:31,084
After all, she spent a half a year to check the bank out.

230
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:37,284
Besides, the lipstick on the mask was situated too low

231
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:40,384
that the chin would be there and not the lips.

232
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:41,884
And above all...

233
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:45,984
It would've smelled of make-up if she wore the mask,

234
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:48,384
but there was no such smell on it.

235
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:53,084
What if someone schemed this all

236
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,284
and is trying to frame her up as the robber?

237
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,584
Oh, no.

238
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,384
Conan, where are you going?

239
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:02,484
Let him be, let him be.

240
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:06,284
Hello, this is Inspector Megure.

241
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:08,184
Oh, Mr. Mouri.

242
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,184
Ms. Masami Hirota's address?

243
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:13,384
We've already checked her place out.

244
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,884
Yes, I know.

245
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:18,184
But I have something I'd like to confirm.

246
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:28,184
Here it is. It's this room!

247
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:30,084
Let's see...

248
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:52,384
If my deduction is right, Ms. Masami is in danger.

249
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,584
I wonder if... if there's some clue somewhere.

250
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:05,984
The outlet is blocked off by the leg of the desk.

251
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:10,184
No, maybe it's deliberately blocked off.

252
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,484
Could it be that...

253
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,284
This is...

254
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:21,284
This is a key to a coin locker.

255
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:26,284
This is probably where the stolen money is hidden.

256
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:37,984
Don't go, Ms. Masami Hirota.

257
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,884
If you go, you'll be killed.

258
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,684
Thank you.

259
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:49,184
But I'm sorry, Gonan.

260
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,384
Wait!

261
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,884
Darn it, there's nobody here.

262
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:06,284
There she is!

263
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,184
It's Ms. Masami!

264
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:11,884
Okay, I'll use this transmitter and my suspenders.

265
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,984
Stick on it, please.

266
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:19,384
Go for it!

267
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:21,884
All right!

268
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:30,484
Okay, she's started off!

269
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,184
I won't let you get away!

270
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:38,284
There's no doubt that she is being used by someone.

271
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:42,184
But who on earth is pulling the strings behind her?

272
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,384
Where are you? Come out here!

273
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:14,084
Good work.

274
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,684
Masami Hirota.

275
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:17,884
Or rather...

276
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:20,684
Akemi Miyano!

277
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,784
May I ask you a question?

278
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:25,184
Why did you kill those two?

279
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:29,984
That's the way we do things.

280
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,784
Now, hand over the cash.

281
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:36,384
It's not here. I have it in another place.

282
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,684
What?

283
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,384
Before I give it to you, get my sister!

284
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,084
Bring my sister here!

285
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,484
You promised, didn't you?

286
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:43,884
That when this job is over,

287
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:47,984
you will let me and my sister out of this organization!

288
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:50,684
There's no deal here.

289
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:56,584
Because she's an indispensable brain to the organization.

290
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,284
Your sister, unlike you,

291
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,784
is a necessity to the organization.

292
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,584
Which means that you didn't intend to...

293
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,684
Come on, this is your last chance.

294
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,384
Tell us where the money is.

295
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:11,684
Don't be silly.

296
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,984
If you kill me, the whereabouts of the cash will be unknown forever.

297
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:17,284
You're the one who's being silly.

298
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:20,984
We already know that you have the key to the coin locker.

299
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:25,284
Besides, this is your last chance.

300
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,284
A gunshot?

301
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:31,584
That way!

302
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:49,784
Ms. Masami!

303
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,984
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. Masami!

304
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:58,684
Conan...

305
00:19:58,684 --> 00:20:00,084
How did you know I was here?

306
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:03,884
I stuck a transmitter onto your car.

307
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,384
I was sure that you were coming to see

308
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:08,884
these people who were pulling the strings from behind the scene.

309
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:12,184
Darn it! If I only explained everything to you back then!

310
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:14,484
Who are you?

311
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,084
Edogawa...

312
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,084
Or rather,

313
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,284
Shinichi Kudo, a detective.

314
00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:24,984
Shinichi Kudo...

315
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:28,084
So, you're him.

316
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:31,184
That's right. I've heard rumors about you.

317
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:35,584
The two men that I hired were killed.

318
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:38,784
And me too, by the organization...

319
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:42,184
Organization?

320
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:45,584
It's a large, mysterious organization.

321
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,984
The only thing that one who is on the bottom of the line knows

322
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:50,684
is that the color of this organization is black.

323
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:51,984
Black?

324
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,284
Yes.

325
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,084
The people of the organization favor wearing that color.

326
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,684
Black clothes as black as a crow.

327
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:09,284
May ask you to do me a last favor?

328
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:12,984
Here.

329
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,084
This is the real key.

330
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,984
The one they took is fake.

331
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:21,084
It's for the coin locker at the east side of Beika Station.

332
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,284
Please, before they realize what's going on.

333
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:31,384
I don't ever want to be used by them again.

334
00:21:31,384 --> 00:21:34,984
I'm counting on you, Little Detective.

335
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:55,484
Hello.

336
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:59,084
I'd like to speak to Inspector Megure of the 1st Division.

337
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:35,184
Since the only fingerprints found on the gun were hers,

338
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,784
it was concluded that she committed suicide

339
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,484
thinking she could not get away.

340
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:43,584
The one billion yen that was robbed was safely collected,

341
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:45,884
and it looked to be that the case was close.

342
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:51,884
But no, it's not over at all!

343
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:54,984
I will never forgive those guys.

344
00:23:54,984 --> 00:23:57,784
I'll nab then for sure with these very hands of mine.

345
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,084
Definitely.

346
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,084
Definitely!

347
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:20,884
"Next Episode"

348
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:22,284
This...

349
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:24,984
This is a 7.62mm bullet!

350
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:26,684
Full Metal Jacket!

351
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,284
Next Conan,

352
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:33,305
"The Stadium Indiscriminate Threatening Case (Part 1)"

353
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,786
Next Conan's Hint:
