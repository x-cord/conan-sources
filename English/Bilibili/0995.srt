1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.400
Due to a misunderstanding,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.450
Kyogoku-san accidentally knocked
out a stuntman filming a TV drama.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.000
He was recruited to fill
in for the stuntman, but...

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.830
While filming, actor Tokuzono-san
fell to his death.

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.120
Tokuzono Saiya (34)
Actor
While filming, actor Tokuzono-san
fell to his death.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.670
Tokuzono Saiya (34)
Actor

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.870
The police arrived, and as their
investigation progressed...

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.760
Odori Daisaku (48)
Assistant Director

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.190
Sorry.

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.100
This is an inappropriate time
for me to laugh about the past.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.250
Only four people besides
Ran-san's group are visible.

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.780
And we can't see the fourth floor.

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.490
Odori Daisaku
Found the culprit [music]

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.830
Find the question that solves the mystery!

15
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.110
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

16
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.210
Sera relentlessly pursues the truth!

17
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.290
Three high school girls demonstrate
their mystery-solving skills!

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.910
Always determining the one truth

19
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.720
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

20
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.220
his name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:57.888 --> 00:02:58.348
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy
(Part Three)

22
00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:01.598
"Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy, Part Three!"
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy
(Part Three)

23
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.898
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy
(Part Three)

24
00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:10.078
And if we can't figure that out,
we can't make any progress.

25
00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:11.248
Right, Conan-kun?

26
00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:15.838
Rather, Kudo Shinichi-kun?

27
00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:17.538
Well, yeah.

28
00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:29.168
Wh-What are you talking about?

29
00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:31.218
D-Don't tease me.

30
00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:33.098
Look closely.

31
00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:34.888
See? I'm a child.

32
00:03:36.298 --> 00:03:40.308
Shinichi-niichan is a high
school student, so he's tall.

33
00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:43.388
But I'm this short. Really, really short.

34
00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:50.018
Yeah, that's what an ordinary
person would think.

35
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:57.668
But my mom went to see my dad in London,

36
00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:04.088
and I saw her return as a young girl.

37
00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:09.048
And I believed the key
to solving that mystery

38
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:12.308
was this boy who caught my eye.

39
00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:15.548
I'm Holmes' apprentice.

40
00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:21.218
If you refuse to admit it,
then it can't be helped.

41
00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:24.808
I'll go talk to the girls again.

42
00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:25.728
Huh? What?

43
00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:27.518
Hey, wait.

44
00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:37.948
Is there a kid who hangs out with Conan-kun
who seems mature for their age?

45
00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:39.838
There is one.

46
00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:44.118
They're even more mature than we are.

47
00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.968
What's their name?

48
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:49.968
It's M-Mitsuhiko.

49
00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:50.748
What?

50
00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:56.758
Mitsuhiko knows a lot for a
first-year grade school student.

51
00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:59.238
That boy with the freckles?

52
00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:02.638
He certainly seems smart, but
he's not as smart as you, is he?

53
00:05:03.918 --> 00:05:05.058
Conan-kun.

54
00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:06.928
Do you have a minute?

55
00:05:06.928 --> 00:05:07.648
Huh?

56
00:05:07.998 --> 00:05:12.478
You were nearby when Odori-san was
poisoned and collapsed, right?

57
00:05:12.658 --> 00:05:13.828
Yeah.

58
00:05:13.828 --> 00:05:17.108
Could you give the Inspector a
detailed account of the incident?

59
00:05:17.338 --> 00:05:18.698
What? Right now?

60
00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:19.858
Yeah.

61
00:05:19.858 --> 00:05:24.798
He wants to confirm if
Odori-san poisoned himself.

62
00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:26.038
What? Um...

63
00:05:26.668 --> 00:05:30.968
I'm kind of, uh...

64
00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.058
I'm in a tough spot right now.

65
00:05:33.058 --> 00:05:33.458
What?

66
00:05:33.658 --> 00:05:36.918
And besides, I don't know that I'd be useful.

67
00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:38.298
There you go again.

68
00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:40.478
You're not acting like your usual self.

69
00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:41.318
Gotcha.

70
00:05:41.318 --> 00:05:42.328
Hey, wait.

71
00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:44.168
I'm borrowing him for a bit.

72
00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:45.848
You can do it, Conan-kun.

73
00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:48.498
Come on, stop struggling.

74
00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:53.608
So, do you know any other kinds who
are strangely mature for their age?

75
00:05:53.848 --> 00:05:56.978
It's got to be Ai-chan, right?

76
00:05:56.978 --> 00:05:59.108
Yeah, Haibara Ai.

77
00:05:59.578 --> 00:06:02.068
She lives at Professor Agasa's house.

78
00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:04.238
She's more than just mature.

79
00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:06.118
She's got a totally cool personality.

80
00:06:06.828 --> 00:06:08.178
Haibara Ai.

81
00:06:09.158 --> 00:06:11.748
She's the girl I met on
the Bell Tree Express.

82
00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:16.868
What's going on?

83
00:06:16.868 --> 00:06:21.388
First Mitsuhiko-kun was sneezing earlier,
and now you're sneezing, Ai-kun?

84
00:06:21.388 --> 00:06:23.398
Are you okay, Ai-chan?

85
00:06:23.398 --> 00:06:26.038
Yeah. I just felt a chill.

86
00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:28.328
Maybe someone's talking about you.

87
00:06:28.328 --> 00:06:29.718
It's probably a cold.

88
00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:31.398
That's not good.

89
00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:33.898
I'll get you some cold medicine. Wait here.

90
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:39.498
I'm next.

91
00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:45.158
I wish I could've gone to see
a movie with Conan-kun, too.

92
00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:47.418
The Azengers, right?

93
00:06:47.418 --> 00:06:50.458
Apparently Kamen Yaiba
is teaming up with them.

94
00:06:50.638 --> 00:06:55.368
Sonoko-san was going on a date at the
same time, so it couldn't be helped.

95
00:06:55.368 --> 00:06:58.338
Apparently that cool girl went with them.

96
00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:00.808
Sera Masumi-san, right?

97
00:07:00.808 --> 00:07:04.598
She seems kind of similar to Ai-chan.

98
00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:07.648
Maybe I'm the only one who thinks that.

99
00:07:07.648 --> 00:07:10.228
Who knows?

100
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:11.848
I found it.

101
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.978
It's the cold medicine.

102
00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:15.478
Now this is no good.

103
00:07:15.928 --> 00:07:18.738
It's way past the expiration date.

104
00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:19.128
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Co.

105
00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:20.988
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Company, huh?
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Co.

106
00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:22.858
No wonder it's old.
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Co.

107
00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:24.928
Shirohato Pharmaceutical Company?

108
00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:26.728
I've never heard of them.

109
00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:32.168
They used to be famous for their
cheap but effective medicines.

110
00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.708
They were a pretty big company, too,

111
00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:39.168
but for some reason they suddenly went under.

112
00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:42.048
They went bankrupt 25 years ago.

113
00:07:42.198 --> 00:07:42.918
What?

114
00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:47.308
It happened because a larger
company attempted to acquire them,

115
00:07:47.308 --> 00:07:49.178
but it didn't go well.

116
00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.298
Y-You know a lot about them.

117
00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:53.808
Yeah, after all,

118
00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:57.878
30 years ago, my father worked as a member

119
00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:01.338
of that pharmaceutical company's R&D team.

120
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:09.338
But the company went bankrupt, and my
parents were forced to become GPs instead.

121
00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:12.668
Since they were renting out their
old home to an acquaintance,

122
00:08:12.668 --> 00:08:15.298
they opened a small clinic elsewhere.

123
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:20.588
That same group kept trying to recruit
them even after they became GPs.

124
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.498
My father kept turning down their offers,

125
00:08:23.498 --> 00:08:26.388
but something made them join their lab.

126
00:08:27.888 --> 00:08:29.938
This isn't very interesting, is it?

127
00:08:29.938 --> 00:08:31.128
Could you forget what I said?

128
00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:33.848
I'm actually curious to
know what happened next.

129
00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:36.528
My late sister told me about it.

130
00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:38.578
I don't know anymore either.

131
00:08:39.688 --> 00:08:42.498
There's no way I could ever tell them.

132
00:08:44.108 --> 00:08:48.618
At that lab, my parents were
forced to create the drug

133
00:08:48.948 --> 00:08:53.368
that turned Kudo-kun and I into children.

134
00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.588
How many times do I have to tell you?

135
00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:04.228
The director just handed him his shake.

136
00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:06.758
The two didn't talk much.

137
00:09:07.288 --> 00:09:12.328
They intended to discuss who'd
fill in for Tokuzono-san,

138
00:09:12.328 --> 00:09:15.818
but because I interrupted them,
they tabled the discussion.

139
00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:18.258
Damn it.

140
00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:22.398
I need to keep an eye on them so Sera
doesn't ask any weird questions.

141
00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:26.698
Did he hand him any food, like a snack?

142
00:09:26.698 --> 00:09:29.318
He was walking around with ramune candies.

143
00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:31.628
He didn't hand him anything.

144
00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:34.788
Odori-san received a message
on his phone, though.

145
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:39.208
What? But there wasn't a phone
among Odori-san's belongings.

146
00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:41.458
That's right.

147
00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:47.488
But I'm pretty sure the footage of Tokuzono-san's
fall captured Odori-san holding a phone.

148
00:09:47.488 --> 00:09:49.048
Check the footage again.

149
00:09:49.048 --> 00:09:50.028
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:56.798 --> 00:09:57.248
Right here.

151
00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:58.128
Hey, we're not ready ye—
Right here.

152
00:09:58.128 --> 00:09:58.728
Hey, we're not ready ye—

153
00:10:00.738 --> 00:10:03.438
See? Odori-san is holding a phone.

154
00:10:03.678 --> 00:10:04.388
Huh?

155
00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:07.348
Did you notice something, Conan-kun?

156
00:10:07.348 --> 00:10:08.918
Y-Yeah.

157
00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:11.948
Hold on. I'll write it down.

158
00:10:14.508 --> 00:10:15.198
Huh?

159
00:10:15.638 --> 00:10:18.328
I left the cap off, so
it won't write anymore.

160
00:10:25.108 --> 00:10:27.958
I see. It's the cap.

161
00:10:43.704 --> 00:10:45.864
Your car is ready, Jinmei-san.

162
00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:47.354
Thanks.

163
00:10:47.354 --> 00:10:48.444
Sir.

164
00:10:48.444 --> 00:10:49.284
Yeah.

165
00:10:49.444 --> 00:10:49.584
Tomioka Shigematsu (50)
Director

166
00:10:49.584 --> 00:10:52.914
Officers, would it be all right if we left?

00:10:52.914 --> 00:10:53.534
Officers, would it be all right if we left?

168
00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:58.794
Tokuzono-chan fell from the fourth floor
because of a practical joke device.

169
00:10:59.004 --> 00:11:01.044
Odori-kun pranked him.

170
00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:02.674
In other words, it was an accident.

171
00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:02.984
Hoegi Yota (26)
AD

172
00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:06.254
His light-hearted joke caused
an unexpected accident.
Hoegi Yota (26)
AD

173
00:11:06.254 --> 00:11:07.554
His light-hearted joke caused
an unexpected accident.

174
00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:08.344
Since poison wasn't found
in Odori-san's shake or cup,

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:12.374
Since poison wasn't found
in Odori-san's shake or cup,

177
00:11:12.374 --> 00:11:14.254
he must have poisoned himself, right?

178
00:11:14.594 --> 00:11:14.614
Aburai Hideka (26)
Makeup Artist

179
00:11:14.614 --> 00:11:17.904
He felt responsible for the
accident and committed suicide.
Aburai Hideka (26)
Makeup Artist

180
00:11:17.904 --> 00:11:18.014
Aburai Hideka (26)
Makeup Artist

181
00:11:18.974 --> 00:11:19.854
Right?

182
00:11:19.854 --> 00:11:22.644
You won't find anything by
keeping us here any longer,

183
00:11:22.644 --> 00:11:26.814
and Hideka-chan and I need
to head to my gravure shoot.

184
00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:28.024
No.

185
00:11:28.024 --> 00:11:30.434
If they're allowed to leave,
they'll destroy the evidence.

186
00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:36.954
But Sera's more interested in
investigating me than solving the case.

187
00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:38.704
I don't have a choice.

188
00:11:39.894 --> 00:11:43.254
Sonoko-neechan, I need to talk to you.

189
00:11:44.994 --> 00:11:47.114
What is it, kid?

190
00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:50.214
Who's Kyogoku-no-niichan's manager?

191
00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:51.344
What?

192
00:11:51.614 --> 00:11:57.634
Apparently a TV station producer wants
to talk to him about his acting debut.

193
00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.644
Really?

194
00:11:58.924 --> 00:11:59.824
Yeah.

195
00:11:59.824 --> 00:12:02.194
He's waiting behind that car.

196
00:12:02.194 --> 00:12:03.404
Got it.

197
00:12:03.404 --> 00:12:06.004
I'll go hear what he has to say.

198
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:11.654
Huh?

199
00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:24.044
Looks like I don't have a choice.

200
00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:34.054
Sera-chan seems distracted, so why don't
I solve this serial murder case instead?

201
00:12:34.214 --> 00:12:37.104
Yes! It's Sonoko the Detective Queen!

202
00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:38.954
Detective Queen?

203
00:12:41.634 --> 00:12:42.974
I see.

204
00:12:42.974 --> 00:12:46.314
When Detective Mori isn't
around, he uses her.

205
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.634
Makoto-san.

206
00:12:48.694 --> 00:12:52.404
Could you keep people away from me so
they can't interfere with my deduction?

207
00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:53.674
Got it.

208
00:12:54.194 --> 00:12:55.484
Excuse me.

209
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:56.614
What? Hey, wait.

210
00:12:56.934 --> 00:12:58.494
Serial murder?

211
00:12:58.954 --> 00:12:59.994
What do you mean?

212
00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:05.254
First, there's actor Tokuzono-san's
fall to his death.

213
00:13:05.774 --> 00:13:10.804
Everyone gathered to film the action
scene in the classroom where he fell.

214
00:13:11.564 --> 00:13:15.574
The crew went on break, and everyone on
the fourth floor returned to the first floor.

215
00:13:15.574 --> 00:13:19.724
Later, Makoto-san headed up to the fourth
floor ahead of the others for his stunt.

216
00:13:20.054 --> 00:13:22.854
AD Hoegi-san was still down below.

217
00:13:23.274 --> 00:13:26.334
Tokuzono-san came to the
fourth floor before him.

218
00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:30.354
Tokuzono-san said he couldn't
find his favorite phone

219
00:13:30.354 --> 00:13:32.364
and called it using another one.

220
00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:36.334
Because there wasn't a scratch on the phone,

221
00:13:36.334 --> 00:13:38.634
we know it wasn't dropped by accident.

222
00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:41.594
It was placed outside the window
to lure Tokuzono-san out there.

223
00:13:42.034 --> 00:13:43.124
And then...

224
00:13:44.884 --> 00:13:49.294
From the beginning, the police assumed the
phone had been tampered with in some way.

225
00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:54.194
If a loud ringtone were set to
sound when a certain number called,

226
00:13:54.194 --> 00:13:57.514
the culprit could have startled Tokuzono-san.

227
00:13:57.714 --> 00:14:00.404
But that number would remain
in the phone's call history,

228
00:14:00.404 --> 00:14:04.264
and more than anything, nobody
heard a loud noise at that time.

229
00:14:04.714 --> 00:14:06.374
The only sound anyone heard

230
00:14:06.374 --> 00:14:11.154
was the quiet fluttering Makoto-san
heard on the fourth floor.

231
00:14:11.464 --> 00:14:13.274
You mean the toy butterfly.

232
00:14:13.474 --> 00:14:14.394
Yes.

233
00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:19.064
The practical joke device found in
Odori-san's belongings flew then.

234
00:14:19.574 --> 00:14:21.734
The phone was unscathed

235
00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:25.784
because it had to be place carefully
on top of the butterfly.

236
00:14:27.514 --> 00:14:30.334
Tokuzono-san hated bugs.

237
00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:33.804
But Tokuzono-san immediately
letting go of his phone,

238
00:14:33.804 --> 00:14:37.424
which meant it remained
unscratched, was unexpected.

239
00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:39.924
So, who set it up?

240
00:14:40.184 --> 00:14:44.444
Since Odori-san was hiding it,
doesn't that mean it was him?

241
00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:49.154
The butterfly flew inside through
the fourth floor window by chance.

242
00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:54.474
Odori-san entered the classroom after
the fall and secretly took it with him.

243
00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:58.324
That's how he determined the
method used by the culprit.

244
00:14:58.704 --> 00:15:01.354
Right, Detective Queen?

245
00:15:01.354 --> 00:15:02.704
Y-Yes.

246
00:15:02.934 --> 00:15:07.954
Odori-san was killed because he tried to use
that as evidence to threaten the culprit.

247
00:15:08.184 --> 00:15:09.904
You're saying that not only
was it not Odori-kun's prank,

248
00:15:09.904 --> 00:15:12.584
but it also wasn't the
reason he killed himself?

249
00:15:12.854 --> 00:15:18.344
While checking the footage of
Tokuzono-san's fall, Odori-san laughed.

250
00:15:18.944 --> 00:15:24.194
Odori-san laughed because he saw
a certain person from the footage.

251
00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:27.874
Decisive evidence of the
true culprit's guilt.

252
00:15:31.204 --> 00:15:32.654
Look closely.

253
00:15:32.654 --> 00:15:36.864
There's someone behaving strangely
even though a person just fell.

254
00:15:43.634 --> 00:15:44.644
That's right.

255
00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:47.244
They took no notice of Tokuzono-san's fall

256
00:15:47.544 --> 00:15:49.984
and kept staring up at the fourth floor.

257
00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:55.504
Makeup artist Aburai Hideka-san,
you're the culprit.

258
00:15:57.434 --> 00:16:00.734
You were watching to see where
the practical joke device went.

259
00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:05.014
You intended to retrieve it while
everyone was distracted by Tokuzono-san.

260
00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:09.004
But unfortunately, it flew
inside the classroom.

261
00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:12.064
Kyogoku-kun, you didn't see it?

262
00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:16.064
No, but I feel like I heard
the fluttering the whole time.

263
00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:20.354
You decided to kill Odori-san
after he threatened you.

264
00:16:20.714 --> 00:16:25.364
Odori-san's phone was
missing from his belongings

265
00:16:25.364 --> 00:16:27.324
because you swiped it to
hide your conversation.

266
00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:31.074
You can't expect me to sit
quietly and listen to this.

267
00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:35.024
If Hideka-chan is the culprit,
then how did she poison him?

268
00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:40.214
There wasn't poison in
Odori-san's shake or his straw.

269
00:16:40.524 --> 00:16:43.844
Aburai-san used that straw to poison him.

270
00:16:44.224 --> 00:16:47.454
She removed the straw's tip,
made a vertical cut in it,

271
00:16:47.454 --> 00:16:50.284
and attached it to another straw like a cap.

272
00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:54.854
Aburai-san coated the cap
with poison beforehand

273
00:16:55.154 --> 00:16:57.354
and said she couldn't
take her allergy medicine

274
00:16:57.724 --> 00:17:00.954
so the AD would go buy drinks.

275
00:17:01.364 --> 00:17:05.864
Naturally, she had already confirmed that
the nearby shop would have the right shake.

276
00:17:06.114 --> 00:17:11.874
Then she pretended to help distribute
drinks and swiped the straw she needed.

277
00:17:12.184 --> 00:17:17.374
All that was left was to give
Odori-san the straw with the cap.

278
00:17:18.084 --> 00:17:21.474
After killing him, she waited for
an opportunity to remove the cap,

279
00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:25.954
creating the mysterious murder in which
no poison would be found anywhere.

280
00:17:26.304 --> 00:17:29.054
Then show us the proof.

281
00:17:30.344 --> 00:17:34.894
Aburai-san, did you take
your allergy medicine?

282
00:17:35.094 --> 00:17:36.144
What?

283
00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:39.774
It's dangerous to carry a poisoned
cap around against your bare skin.

284
00:17:39.774 --> 00:17:43.944
If it were me, I'd roll it up
and hide it inside a capsule

285
00:17:43.944 --> 00:17:46.154
after committing the crime.

286
00:17:46.434 --> 00:17:48.374
That's what you did, isn't it?

287
00:17:48.374 --> 00:17:51.674
And because you hid it
among the other capsules,

288
00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:54.344
you can't take them anymore.

289
00:17:54.944 --> 00:17:57.744
If that capsule were found,
that would prove it was you.

290
00:17:58.194 --> 00:17:59.424
There was just one problem.

291
00:17:59.424 --> 00:18:02.754
Shakes typically come with straight straws.

292
00:18:02.754 --> 00:18:05.674
It would be immediately
obvious if one had a cap.

293
00:18:05.914 --> 00:18:08.324
In other words, that trick...

294
00:18:09.774 --> 00:18:10.684
Yes.

295
00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:15.414
It was insurance in case I failed to kill
Tokuzono-san using the practical joke device.

296
00:18:15.414 --> 00:18:17.754
It wasn't meant for Odori-san.

297
00:18:18.374 --> 00:18:21.314
Tokuzono-san doesn't drink shakes.

298
00:18:21.654 --> 00:18:24.434
I was lucky that nobody found
the straw type suspicious

299
00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:28.234
because the director handed
Odori-san his shake.

300
00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.874
Then it really was you?

301
00:18:31.474 --> 00:18:33.134
But why?

302
00:18:33.134 --> 00:18:35.334
Was it because of Nishibe?

303
00:18:36.784 --> 00:18:37.594
Yes.

304
00:18:38.824 --> 00:18:44.294
Tokuzono-san's prank reminded
him of how he hurt Jinmei-san.

305
00:18:44.294 --> 00:18:46.344
He didn't get any sleep that night.

306
00:18:47.024 --> 00:18:50.654
But the next day, he said he was
heading to the filming location.

307
00:18:50.654 --> 00:18:54.824
He said he'd cause more trouble
if he didn't go and took his car.

308
00:18:57.254 --> 00:19:00.524
I spent so much time wondering
if I should kill him.

309
00:19:00.524 --> 00:19:05.604
I kept telling myself that more
than one thing caused the accident.

310
00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:06.864
But...

311
00:19:07.094 --> 00:19:11.114
Unlike you ADs, us actors can't be replaced.

312
00:19:13.454 --> 00:19:16.384
After hearing those words
today, I made up my mind.

313
00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:21.544
I had to make him apologize to
Nishibe-kun in the afterlife.

314
00:19:23.854 --> 00:19:24.674
What?

315
00:19:27.144 --> 00:19:28.344
Hey, open the door.

316
00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:30.094
Open the door, Aburai-san.

317
00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:42.134
Huh?

318
00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:48.984
Sera-chan!

319
00:19:50.194 --> 00:19:51.194
Crap.

320
00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:55.734
Is she trying to kill herself by
crashing into the school building?

321
00:20:00.674 --> 00:20:01.924
Nishibe-kun.

322
00:20:02.764 --> 00:20:04.094
Just wait.

323
00:20:04.094 --> 00:20:07.134
I'm on my way.

324
00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:14.934
Huh?

325
00:20:18.704 --> 00:20:19.434
What?

326
00:20:24.304 --> 00:20:26.524
R-Ran-san, hurry!

327
00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:44.244
You idiot.

328
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.404
I was trying to kill myself
so I could join Nishibe-kun.

329
00:20:47.404 --> 00:20:49.334
Why did you stop me?!

330
00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:54.474
To save you from earning any more guilt.

331
00:20:54.844 --> 00:20:56.614
What guilt?

332
00:20:56.614 --> 00:20:59.094
I was just trying to kill myself.

333
00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:02.624
Lives don't belong to anyone.

334
00:21:03.694 --> 00:21:06.864
They're something precious that
should never be taken away.

335
00:21:10.944 --> 00:21:15.124
It's something I picked
up from my friend's mom.

336
00:22:48.044 --> 00:22:49.424
Hideka-chan.

337
00:22:51.164 --> 00:22:54.634
I know this isn't the right time to say this,

338
00:22:54.814 --> 00:22:58.104
but she looked incredible just now.

339
00:22:59.104 --> 00:23:02.224
She reminds me of a young Fujimine Yukiko.

340
00:23:03.684 --> 00:23:06.304
Maybe I'll scout her.

341
00:23:08.254 --> 00:23:10.604
You should talk to him first.

342
00:23:11.254 --> 00:23:15.054
He stopped a car from speeding
into a building by himself.

343
00:23:15.054 --> 00:23:15.944
Yeah.

344
00:23:15.944 --> 00:23:17.904
It's the birth of two new stars.

345
00:23:22.714 --> 00:23:24.944
And so, the case was solved,

346
