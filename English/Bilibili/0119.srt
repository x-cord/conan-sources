1
00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:04.468
Encounters are mysterious!
But the world is even more so!

2
00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:06.628
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:10.178
Today is finally Masked Yaiba!
Inside the costume is an incident!

4
00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:11.888
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:13.848
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:16.058
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.501
"The Masked Yaiba Murder Case."

8
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:05.551
Oh? You're eating out today, Conan-kun?

9
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:09.641
Yeah, I'm meeting them
in front of this shrine at 6:00.

10
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:12.271
You're so lucky. Is it eel?

11
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:16.271
No, I think a good curry
restaurant opened up near here.

12
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.671
I love curry!

13
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.151
Let's eat, too!

14
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.191
I want a jumbo fried shrimp curry!

15
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:25.741
Geez, you guys...

16
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.791
The Laser Police!

17
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:38.751
Laser Police?

18
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:42.171
The police squad in Masked Yaiba!

19
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:46.341
H-Hi, kids. Are you fans of Masked Yaiba?

20
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.041
I love Masked Yaiba!

21
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:52.851
Does this mean they're
filming Masked Yaiba at this shrine?!

22
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:55.311
Oh, no, it's not like that...

23
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:57.521
This gun's so cool!

24
00:02:57.521 --> 00:02:58.601
Don't touch that!

25
00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:01.791
Sorry!

26
00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:06.751
This gun is important for
fighting monsters, so only I can touch it.

27
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.151
Bye!

28
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.821
What's the big deal?

29
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:15.871
Conan-kun! Been waiting long?

30
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:19.081
No, I just got here.

31
00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:24.491
What's with you guys?

32
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:26.621
They want to eat curry with us!

33
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:27.511
What?!

34
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.741
Oh, come on! The more the merrier!

35
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:33.991
And who's gonna pay for 'em?

36
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:35.911
You.

37
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:40.191
Oh, but call your moms first,
so they won't worry!

38
00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:41.701
Okay!

39
00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:45.531
Geez!

40
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:49.781
What kind of parents are they,
all saying, "That would be great!"?!

41
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.491
Look!

42
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.241
It's Masked Yaiba!

43
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:02.961
Yaiba Kick!

44
00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:05.471
Awesome! Awesome!

45
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:06.571
So cool!

46
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:07.881
This is like a dream!

47
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:13.841
First the Laser Police, and now
Masked Yaiba? What's with today?

48
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:18.991
Oh! Aren't you Mori Kogoro-san,
the great detective?!

49
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:20.561
Yes, that's me...

50
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:25.521
Wow! This is incredible!
I'm a big fan! Let me shake your hand!

51
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:29.231
Look! He's shaking
hands with Masked Yaiba!

52
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:34.161
No, I'm not the real Masked Yaiba.

53
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:35.411
Tsutsumi Yasuyuki (21) Jonan University, Law Dept.

54
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:37.451
I'm Tsutsumi Yasuyuki,
Tsutsumi Yasuyuki (21) Jonan University, Law Dept.

55
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.371
and I'm a member of a college fan club.
Tsutsumi Yasuyuki (21) Jonan University, Law Dept.

56
00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:43.871
He's right! He isn't Masked Yaiba!

57
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:46.591
Yes, the real one
looks a lot more handsome.

58
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.051
Sorry for disappointing you.

59
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.761
Then that other person was also...

60
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.371
Say! Want to come to a party?

61
00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:57.821
Party?

62
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:01.931
Our fan club is having a costume party!

63
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.111
Wow! That sounds like fun!

64
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:05.101
I'd love to go!

65
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:06.911
Go! Go!

66
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.771
Now I won't have
to pay for their food!

67
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:12.491
You're invited too, Mori-san!
There'll be beer, too!

68
00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:16.201
B-Beer?! I'd love to! I'd love to!

69
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:19.081
Now you won't have to pay for your beer!

70
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.471
The party is in the basement of this mansion!

71
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:26.201
Look at all the monsters!

72
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.501
Even Monkeyshroom
and Pork-n-Bones are here!

73
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:31.461
The Mole Alien, too!

74
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:34.681
Mori-san. Let me introduce you.

75
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:41.321
This is our club's president,
Saotome Madoka-san. This is her house.

76
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.141
Are you a college student?

77
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:43.781
Yes! I'm in my third year studying literature!

78
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.821
Saotome Madoka (21) Shirakaba Women's College
Yes! I'm in my third year studying literature!

79
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:50.111
It's an honor to speak with the great Mori-san!
Saotome Madoka (21) Shirakaba Women's College

80
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:51.821
It's my pleasure!

81
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:56.781
I can recount my humble exploits
anytime you want, day or night!

82
00:05:57.281 --> 00:06:00.491
Do you know who
she's dressed up as?

83
00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:02.621
Yeah! Natsume Rei, right?

84
00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:04.751
Correct! You must tune in a lot!

85
00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:08.461
Have you ever watched
Masked Yaiba, Mori-san?

86
00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:13.711
I'd really like to, but I'm so
busy with work that time of day...

87
00:06:13.711 --> 00:06:16.431
More like drinking that time of day...

88
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:20.571
Masked Yaiba is really a young
man who sells hot dogs at the park

89
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:24.141
with Natsume Rei,
his childhood friend!

90
00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:28.121
Each time an incident occurs,
he rushes there on his motorcycle

91
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:31.361
and fights the
evil bad guys and aliens!

92
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.031
But Natsume Rei doesn't
know his secret identity!

93
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:40.741
So he's always ditching work
to rush off on his motorcycle!

94
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:45.701
Even so, Natsume Rei
forgives him with gentle feelings!

95
00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:49.921
For some reason,
I somehow know how that feels...

96
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:55.381
Come to think of it, that does
sound kind of like me and Ran...

97
00:06:55.701 --> 00:07:00.321
Okay, everyone! Let's go to
the tables! We have some juice!

98
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:01.721
Yay!

99
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.281
What about me, Madoka-san?

100
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:06.781
She loves kids.

101
00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:09.691
Oh, I wish I could be a kid again!

102
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:13.151
I wish I could be an adult again!

103
00:07:17.281 --> 00:07:20.071
Hey there, Honda! You're late!

104
00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:20.491
Yeah, sorry. It took longer than I thought.

105
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:23.871
Honda Osamu (21) Jonan Univ., Engineering Dept.
Yeah, sorry. It took longer than I thought.

106
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:28.501
He's that other guy. I guess
he is a member of the fan club.

107
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:31.411
Huh? Why're you dressed like that?

108
00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:33.671
I thought I'd change things up a bit.

109
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:39.571
What a shock. You've only ever
dressed as Masked Yaiba before.

110
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:43.431
Oh, yeah! This is Mori Kogoro-san,
the famous detective!

111
00:07:44.491 --> 00:07:45.891
M-Mori?

112
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:52.121
He's Honda Osamu. He's in his
third year of engineering at Jonan U.

113
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.491
He's only been in the club half a year,

114
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.031
but he's a very
passionate Masked Yaiba fan!

115
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:02.991
That gun wouldn't
happen to be real, would it?

116
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:06.371
Don't be silly! It's only
a model! See for yourself!

117
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:11.081
I bet it's well-made!
He's a real gun fanatic!

118
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.591
The texture and weight are impressive...

119
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:23.741
The bullets are all blanks.
The barrel is plugged too, of course.

120
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:24.801
Indeed.

121
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:30.731
Mori-san! Won't you
come and tell us a story?

122
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:33.691
Yes, Madoka-san! Right away!

123
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.621
What a nice reply.

124
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:36.651
Yes.

125
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:38.891
Come over to the tables, too!

126
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:39.581
Okay!

127
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:44.571
Honda!

128
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:53.871
I've had enough! Get ready, Honda! I'm gonna kill you!
Mishima Katsuji (21) Toto University, P.E. Dept.

129
00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:58.091
Mishima-kun?!

130
00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:01.301
W-Wait, Mishima! What did I ever do?!

131
00:09:01.821 --> 00:09:04.471
I can't stand you anymore!

132
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:07.181
Calm down, Mishima! Let's talk it over!

133
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:10.221
Shut up! Die!

134
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:15.521
Honda-kun!

135
00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:22.361
No!

136
00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.321
Stop, Conan-kun!

137
00:09:23.321 --> 00:09:24.741
Mishima!

138
00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:37.791
What the hell?!

139
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:50.011
What?!

140
00:09:57.821 --> 00:09:59.441
A bulletproof vest...

141
00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:03.551
Wearing this saved me...

142
00:10:04.991 --> 00:10:05.601
Honda!

143
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:07.611
Honda-kun! Are you okay?!

144
00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:08.931
Don't move!

145
00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:16.291
There's no burn mark on his temple!

146
00:10:16.871 --> 00:10:22.321
Come to think of it, he kept the
gun away from his head when he shot.

147
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.761
Why?

148
00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:30.411
The deceased is
Mishima Katsuji-san, age 21.

149
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:33.241
A third year student at Toto U.'s
physical education department.

150
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:34.431
Inspector.

151
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:37.561
This was a genuine suicide.

152
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:42.071
After all, we all witnessed it.

153
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:48.241
Still... this is a rather odd sight...

154
00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:54.661
The Laser Police always wear
these vests when fighting monsters,

155
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:58.371
so I bought one
from a security store.

156
00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:01.071
So, convinced he'd killed you,

157
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:04.911
Mishima-san then
shot himself in the head?

158
00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:08.841
But why would he try to kill you?

159
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:11.161
That's because...

160
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:12.991
Inspector.

161
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:16.931
Honda-kun and Mishima-kun
were actually very good friends.

162
00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:19.101
So what happened?

163
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:24.281
About ten days ago,
when we had gathered to plan this party,

164
00:11:24.281 --> 00:11:27.991
Mishima-kun got mad at an
off-hand comment by Honda-kun

165
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.321
and stormed out.

166
00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:33.621
What did you say to him?

167
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:38.201
I told him, "Your motorcycle is lame."

168
00:11:38.201 --> 00:11:39.541
That's it?!

169
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:44.001
That's absurd! Nobody would
be driven to murder because of that!

170
00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:47.871
No, it's not as crazy as it sounds.

171
00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:52.971
He was especially obsessive
about Masked Yaiba, even among us.

172
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:56.561
He spent half a year
remodeling a normal motorcycle

173
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:59.431
into a Masked Yaiba motorcycle.

174
00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:04.691
So I can understand why making
fun of it would make him mad.

175
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.071
I see...

176
00:12:07.071 --> 00:12:09.651
I guess that's the
only way to explain it.

177
00:12:09.651 --> 00:12:15.871
His explanation seems truthful enough.
But something bugs me!

178
00:12:15.871 --> 00:12:18.911
There's something
about this incident!

179
00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:23.991
Inspector Megure.
The gun was a modified model gun.

180
00:12:23.991 --> 00:12:27.911
The bullet in the bulletproof
vest was also made by hand.

181
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:30.091
Thank you.

182
00:12:30.531 --> 00:12:34.051
Was Mishima-san
knowledgeable about guns at all?

183
00:12:34.371 --> 00:12:36.661
I don't believe so.

184
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:41.521
He once asked me the difference
between automatics and revolvers.

185
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:45.611
Come to think of it, do all
Masked Yaiba members...?

186
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:52.321
Hey, what characters
in Masked Yaiba carry guns?

187
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:56.281
Only the Laser Police carry guns, duh!

188
00:12:56.701 --> 00:12:59.201
Masked Yaiba himself doesn't?

189
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:03.411
Conan-kun! Masked Yaiba
has no need for guns!

190
00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:05.501
He always fights with his bare hands!

191
00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.241
I thought so!

192
00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:12.221
Still, that leaves
too many things unclear...

193
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:16.431
It sure is shocking to see
something like this happen, though.

194
00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:21.601
That's for sure. I guess TV dramas
aren't entirely fiction after all.

195
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:25.401
Dramas? Acting?

196
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:34.071
All the mysteries connect now!

197
00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:37.371
This was a murder!

198
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.090
If my theory is correct,
it solves all the mysteries.

199
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.960
Damn... Committing
a murder right in front of me...

200
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.400
Unforgivable!

201
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.590
Proof! I need to find undeniable proof!

202
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.450
That's it! As I recall--!

203
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.170
Genta! Let me borrow your
Detective League badge for a minute!

204
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.440
Huh? Mine?

205
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.790
Mori-san did?

206
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:19.070
Yeah... he asked me to get it examined
right away. Says it's urgent.

207
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.550
Inspector, I'd like to
take Honda to the hospital...

208
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.880
Oh, right.

209
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.020
Even with the bulletproof vest on,
he was shot from close range.

210
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.570
He could have a cracked rib.
Let's drive him there right away.

211
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.820
Huh? W-Why--?

212
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.950
Not so fast, Inspector.

213
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.870
Please wait until later
to take him to the hospital.

214
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:54.210
Allow me to solve the mystery
of this detestable murder for you.

215
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.340
What're you talking about, Mori-kun?

216
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.630
Didn't Mishima-san commit suicide?

217
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.510
No... this was a bonafide murder.

218
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.970
Plotted by a certain
someone from the start.

219
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.350
Come again?!

220
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.510
This someone suggested to Mishima-san

221
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.770
that they act out a little play
to surprise everyone at the party.

222
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.480
Act?

223
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:27.210
In it, Mishima-san would pretend
to shoot someone, then kill himself.

224
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:33.210
To lay the groundwork for this,
they had a fake argument beforehand.

225
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.500
Yes... that someone was you,
Honda Osamu-san!

226
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.220
What?

227
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.420
First, you modified two
model guns of the same type

228
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.210
and prepared two types of bullets.

229
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:59.560
One type was a real lead bullet.
The other was an empty "blank."

230
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.780
You initially gave Mishima-san
the gun with the blanks.

231
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.840
Today, before the party began,
you met him at the Beika Shrine

232
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.920
and switched his gun
with the gun with real bullets...

233
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.960
Probably by saying
you were doing final checks.

234
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.920
Then the gun on Honda-san's
hip is Mishima-san's?!

235
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.970
No, wait. Wasn't the
barrel of that gun plugged?

236
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:37.260
Plus, the gun with
real bullets wasn't plugged...

237
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.940
Wouldn't Mishima-san have noticed?

238
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.760
No... the gun he handed
Mishima-san wasn't plugged.

239
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.460
He plugged it after the switch,

240
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.120
so he wouldn't
rouse suspicion after the fact.

241
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.590
Honda-san dressed
up as a Laser Police member

242
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.370
instead of his usual
choice of Masked Yaiba

243
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.960
because it wouldn't seem
strange for a Laser Police member

244
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.880
to carry a gun and
wear a bulletproof vest.

245
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.130
When Mishima-san jumped down,

246
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.970
you moved as if taking
us out of harm's way,

247
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.730
but it was actually to make
you an easier target for him.

248
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.010
B-But, Mori-san!

249
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:25.400
Wouldn't Mishima know something
was up if a real bullet came out?

250
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.420
He and Honda-san
had probably done rehearsals

251
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.820
in which he would pretend to be
hit the same time the gun sounded.

252
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.120
So, after seeing Honda-san
being "hit" this time,

253
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.630
Mishima-san believed it was
just like it was during rehearsal.

254
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.340
It's your so-called "autosuggestion."

255
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:50.010
But do you have any evidence
that he didn't commit suicide?

256
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.550
If you were to kill yourself by
putting a gun to your head and firing,

257
00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.140
burn marks would be left on your head.

258
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.090
However, there were none on Mishima-san.

259
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.050
Even with blanks,
it still produces a small flame.

260
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.880
Which is why he held the
gun slightly away from his head,

261
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.030
to prevent being burned.

262
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.910
You can't be sure about that!
He was a weird guy!

263
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.050
Then allow me to show you some proof.

264
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.120
Examiner!

265
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:28.050
Another set of fingerprints not
belonging to the late Mishima-san

266
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.460
was found on this gun.

267
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.970
They also match the
child's fingerprints on this badge.

268
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.020
Oh! That badge!

269
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.390
That's Genta-kun's!

270
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.550
Which means...

271
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.380
...I'm the killer?

272
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.170
Genta-kun! When did you
touch Mishima-san's gun?!

273
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.110
I-I didn't!

274
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.380
Yes.

275
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.320
If Genta didn't touch Mishima-san's gun,
how did his prints get on it?

276
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.300
The answer to that is... Conan!

277
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.880
Right!

278
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.840
Honda-san.

279
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.260
You ran into us at the Beika Shrine
before coming here, right?

280
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.670
And then Genta...

281
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.090
This gun's so cool!

282
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.550
Don't touch that!

283
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.260
H-He touched it then?

284
00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.550
The fact you had Mishima-san's gun then

285
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.000
is evidence that
you switched your guns later!

286
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.190
Honda-kun...

287
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.400
Mori-san. When did
you start to suspect me?

288
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:38.090
Tsutsumi-san said that
you were a real gun aficionado.

289
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.620
Yet, you had a plugged gun.
That seemed odd to me.

290
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:51.550
I see. Plugging the gun to be
extra safe proved to be my downfall...

291
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:55.550
Mishima...
killed my kid brother!

292
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.050
Two years ago, my brother Hiroshi
was heading to a friend's house

293
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.600
with a Masked Yaiba signboard
To Hiroshi-kun

294
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.560
that he won in a magazine contest.

295
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.360
Wait! Give it back!

296
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.560
Hiroshi died two days later.

297
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:30.290
His final words were,
"Get Masked Yaiba to catch him..."

298
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.840
I joined a number of Masked Yaiba
fan clubs to gather information

299
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.220
and figure out who stole it!

300
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.810
Then, half a year ago...

301
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.890
...Mishima finally
showed me that signboard!

302
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.650
He said his older brother
had won it and given it to him!

303
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.530
But he doesn't have
a brother named Hiroshi!

304
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.030
So then you got your revenge on him?

305
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.920
Inspector, it's not
discussed in the TV drama,

306
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.750
but Masked Yaiba has a back
story in which his sister was killed.

307
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:15.710
I joined fan clubs to kill the person
who drove my brother to death,

308
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.470
but at some point, I began
to feel just like Masked Yaiba.

309
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.390
You and Masked Yaiba are nothing alike!

310
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.130
Masked Yaiba doesn't fight for revenge!

311
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.310
Yeah! He fights for justice!

312
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.380
Yes, the children are right.

313
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:41.280
It's a shame you were that
wrong about Masked Yaiba all along.

314
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.600
Oh! Yoko-chan's on
a music show starting at 7:30!

315
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.060
Oh, but we're watching
Masked Yaiba at 7:30.

316
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.770
What?! We never watch that junk!

317
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.390
We decided to watch it starting tonight!

318
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:46.180
After all, Masked Yaiba fights for justice!
We gotta support him!

319
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.490
Right, Conan-kun?

320
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.850
Don't be stupid!
What about Yoko-chan?!

321
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.410
What about her?

322
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.620
S-She's sings for me!

323
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.890
This old guy's gonna live a long life...

324
00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.200
T-That was President Yamazaki!

325
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.670
What's this sticky stuff?!

326
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.630
So it was a completely locked room...

327
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.160
This might not have been an accident!

328
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.850
It's possible it was a murder
plotted by one of these people!

329
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.620
On the next Conan--

330
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.830
"The Honey Cocktail Murder Case."
