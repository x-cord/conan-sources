1
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,824
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:18,524
happy new year!

3
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:22,224
On behalf of the Conan family,

4
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:26,424
I would like to thank you the viewers out there

5
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:29,224
from the bottom of our hearts for your support,

6
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:33,024
which has enabled us to make it to 2016.

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:37,724
This year also marks the 20th anniversary

8
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:41,524
since the first airing of Detective Conan.

9
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:44,124
As a token of our appreciation for these 20 years,

10
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:47,824
we have prepared many special plans.

11
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:50,224
Our first,

12
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,624
is bringing you one-hour specials over a period of two weeks!

13
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:58,624
We're sure that you'll enjoy both part one and part two.

14
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,824
Most appropriate for this program,

15
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:06,224
a super duper fantastic special guest is here.

16
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,624
I am Ebizo Ichikawa.

17
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:17,224
"Ebizo Ichikawa XI"

18
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:22,724
And now, for the first part of our two-part New Year Special,

19
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:28,524
which we present to you

20
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:35,524
for your enjoyment.

21
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,724
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

22
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,824
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

23
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:46,624
In the gorgeous world of Kabuki,

24
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,824
the legendary mask attracts a case.

25
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:50,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,424
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:40,254
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 1)"

29
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,454
Over here, Mitsuhiko!

30
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,754
There!

31
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:46,354
Hey!

32
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:47,954
Watch where you kick the ball!

33
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,554
You darn!

34
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:52,954
What? That was my best shot today!

35
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:55,154
You're supposed to pass! -What are you doing?

36
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:59,054
I wonder why boys love to play with balls so much.

37
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,154
Beats me.

38
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,654
Mitsuhiko! No trap! Volley!

39
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:09,254
Here goes!

40
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,754
You never fail to amuse me.

41
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,354
Brake oil.

42
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,154
There's a railroad crossing up ahead!

43
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,054
Contact them!

44
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,554
Yeah.

45
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,454
Idiot!

46
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,554
Oh, no.

47
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:34,054
"Toto Paper Recycling Plant"

48
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:49,954
The brakes have apparently been rigged.

49
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,754
"Takuya Hosoo (47)" -I understand,

50
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:54,354
"HO Trading President" -but I'm busy today.

51
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,554
Let's go to the station so we can hear you out, shall we?

52
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:04,454
I'm sorry, but I really don't have the time.

53
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,654
May I open the trunk?

54
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:11,954
-Hey, brat! -Conan!

55
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:16,154
Why the heck!

56
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:19,354
I'm so sorry that something like this happened

57
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:21,354
all because I wasn't watching.

58
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,854
I'm always telling him to live his life

59
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:27,154
without causing trouble to others,

60
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,454
but he doesn't listen, you see. This brat...

61
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:34,954
I mean, this boy. Please forgive him.

62
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:37,754
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

63
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:40,454
He dashed out to the street on his skateboard,

64
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:42,354
that's why the car got into an accident, right?

65
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:47,654
No. This boy stopped my car that went berserk.

66
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:49,654
Is that so?

67
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:53,254
But Sonoko told me she happened to be watching,

68
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,554
so she called me.

69
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:57,854
Sonoko! Where are you, Sonoko?

70
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:02,054
The car was in fact rigged so that the brakes wouldn't work.

71
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,354
What? That's attempted murder.

72
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:07,154
We've got to preserve the crime site

73
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,854
and call forensics immediately.

74
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,454
We're doing that now.

75
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:13,254
Oh, I see!

76
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:15,254
Sonoko!

77
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:17,954
Brat! You did it!

78
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:21,154
Jumping to conclusions again.

79
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:24,554
Well, right after he dashed out,

80
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,054
I heard the crash.

81
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,854
So I thought he finally showed his true self.

82
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,154
I wonder how she sees me.

83
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:35,454
You're President Suzuki's daughter?

84
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,854
Mr. Hosoo?

85
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:38,354
You know each other?

86
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,954
My dad's a great fan of Kabuki,

87
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:44,454
so I've met him many times at the closing party after the show.

88
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:46,854
He's from the world of Kabuki?

89
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:50,854
You don't look to have any connection with the world of Kabuki.

90
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:54,654
I've had meals with Ebizo several times for that matter, you know?

91
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,154
-No joke. -Together?

92
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:59,154
Ebizo? Is that sushi shop good?

93
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,154
Talk about ignorant.

94
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:01,754
What're you talking about, Dad?

95
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:04,254
She's talking about Mr. Ebizo Ichikawa.

96
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,754
The Sushi Shop is in Ichikawa?

97
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,554
Pops Kogoro, cut it out already.

98
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,954
Pops Kogoro?

99
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:15,054
Are you by chance, Mr. Kogoro Mouri,

100
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:16,554
the great detective?

101
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:21,354
Yes. I am the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

102
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:22,654
Can I be of help?

103
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:23,954
What a coincidence.

104
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:27,854
Ebizo actually is a great fan of yours, Mr. Mouri.

105
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,454
Is that so?

106
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:31,654
But you see,

107
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:35,154
I've never been to that Sushi Shop.

108
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,554
The brakes?

109
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:46,554
It wasn't broken?

110
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:49,454
The police are investigating it now.

111
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:52,954
I'll probably have to go over later too.

112
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:55,354
But I've got to deliver this first.

113
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:56,854
"Hitoshi Takahashi (40), Hosoo's secretary" -You were the last one

114
00:08:56,854 --> 00:09:00,654
-in the garage last night, weren't you? -Yes.

115
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:03,654
Didn't you notice anything strange back then?

116
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,454
Like what?

117
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:09,454
Like seeing a suspicious character and such.

118
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:12,654
No, I would've noticed if there were.

119
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,354
"There is no performance today"

120
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,554
"Yoshiyuki Yabusaki (57), President"

121
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:40,354
Mr. Hosoo, I've been waiting for you.

122
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:42,954
I've brought an acquaintance along with me.

123
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,554
I hope you don't mind.

124
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:46,154
Sure, of course.

125
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,854
I'm Yabusaki, the president.

126
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,754
Hi. Nice meeting you.

127
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,354
The president... You mean of a bank?

128
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:56,254
In the world of Kabuki,

129
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:59,554
the person who manages all the actors is called the president.

130
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:02,454
Wow, little lady knows a lot.

131
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:05,854
-This seems a bit off. -All right.

132
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:09,254
I need to do a voice check.

133
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:12,354
Everyone's gathered here.

134
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:16,354
Oh, how joyous!

135
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,054
Ebizo!

136
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:24,454
What's this performance called?

137
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:28,054
-Kabuki Juhachiban Nanatsunomen (Seven Masks). -Is the lighting too bright?

138
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,254
-I think it's good. -Seven Masks?

139
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,754
In 1742,

140
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:35,954
Ebizo the Second performed in,

141
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,254
but it wasn't shown to the public much.

142
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,154
What kind of story is it?

143
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:44,154
In recent years, it was performed in 1893 and 1983.

144
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,554
And seven years ago,

145
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:48,054
Ebizo himself performed it, you see.

146
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,554
The setting is at General Major Yoshida's residence.

147
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:53,654
The mask maker Akaemon Gagoze.

148
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,754
That's Ebizo's role, by the way,

149
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,054
is being awaited by Princess Sakura.

150
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,154
Who's Princess Sakura?

151
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,854
Before that, who's Akaemon?

152
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:02,754
Akaemon arrives and...

153
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:03,854
Answer me.

154
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:05,654
He takes the masks out of the five boxes,

155
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,854
and dances a dance that corresponds to each mask.

156
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:09,354
The five masks?

157
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:11,554
What? Oh, found it.

158
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:14,054
The old man, (Shiofuki) the clown,

159
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,854
(Hannya) female demon, (Uba) the old woman,

160
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,754
and lastly, (Buaku) looks like a man from India.

161
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,354
These all symbolize evil.

162
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:22,254
And, the Kumehira... Whatever.

163
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,454
In any case, he's the enemy.

164
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:26,454
When that guy goes in to steal the family heirloom,

165
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:29,354
Akaemon who is wearing the mask of Buaku appears.

166
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,654
Whatever saemon is surprised

167
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:35,154
and the box with the masks closes and doesn't open.

168
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:37,054
That's what's written there, right?

169
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:39,054
Shut up, kid.

170
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:41,354
At any rate, it's an incredible play, right?

171
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:44,554
If it's called Seven Masks, why are there only five boxes?

172
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:47,054
Yes, I wish you'd be quiet too, Pops!

173
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:49,854
Seven Masks is a difficult play.

174
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,454
Difficult?

175
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:53,754
Yes. I heard that the only script left

176
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,554
was burned in the Edo Era.

177
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:59,654
"Seven Masks" -There were no such things as copy machines back

178
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:02,454
and neither are there any handwritten copies left.

179
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:05,754
Which means the story that exists today is...

180
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:08,854
It's what's been handed down by word of mouth,

181
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,054
so it's probably a bit different from the original.

182
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,254
Who cares, so long as it's good.

183
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:16,054
It's not like anybody saw the first performance, right?

184
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:18,354
I mean it was the Edo period, you know.

185
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:22,854
That's why Ebizo decided to create a modern version of the Seven Masks.

186
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:25,954
And I'm really putting my all into it.

187
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,454
My god. I won't bite you.

188
00:12:30,454 --> 00:12:32,754
Mr. Hosoo, I've been waiting for you.

189
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:35,054
Ebizo! I'm Sonoko!

190
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,254
Sonoko... Which one?

191
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:41,254
Sonoko Suzuki.

192
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:43,954
Oh, yeah.

193
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:46,254
No way.

194
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:48,354
I'm sorry, I'm late.

195
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,554
Here it is.

196
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:50,754
-Ebizo... -Let's go over there.

197
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,954
-Will you all come too, then? -Sonoko.

198
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,154
This is it?

199
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:55,454
The two-faced mask.

200
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:56,854
The genuine?

201
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,354
Gets me nervous.

202
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:01,954
Who will open it?

203
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:03,954
Of course, who else

204
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:06,754
"Shinnosuke Iwami (29), Playwright" -but you, Ebizo.

205
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,054
"Eiji Kaneko (37), Cameraman" -Hold it. I want to change the angle.

206
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:14,054
Hey, be careful.

207
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,954
Yes.

208
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,354
I'll open it.

209
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,554
This is...

210
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,154
It's very beautiful.

211
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:27,554
It's a miracle.

212
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,854
Beautiful.

213
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,354
This angle.

214
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:47,254
This two-faced mask is...

215
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,366
Depending on what angle you look at it from,

216
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,166
its facial expression changes.

217
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,566
It sure is fantastic.

218
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,666
This mask was made in the Kamakura Era,

219
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,066
but it's unknown who made it.

220
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,666
However, it was found that this was created

221
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,966
with the exact same lumber that was used

222
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:13,866
during the reconstruction of the Great Buddhist Hall in Todaji Temple

223
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,766
between 1185 to 1195.

224
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:17,966
In other words,

225
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:20,466
it was made from the wood that was left over

226
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:22,966
after making the Great Buddhist Hall.

227
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:25,166
So wood has DNA.

228
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:29,466
The president bought back what had crossed over to a collector abroad.

229
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,166
How... how much did you buy it for?

230
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,466
Billions.

231
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,166
Takahashi!

232
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,166
Who cares about the price?

233
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:41,166
Japanese cultural assets going overseas is a problem.

234
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:45,366
Mr. Hosoo showed me the two-faced mask some time ago,

235
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:48,766
so I decided to use it in my play this time.

236
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:52,866
The program is Kabuki Juhachiban The Seven Masks, right?

237
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:56,866
Ebizo, why did you decide to do the Seven Masks?

238
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,266
Conan!

239
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,766
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,366
I'm Ran Mouri.

241
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,166
Trying to get him to get to know you!

242
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,366
Quiet, Dad!

243
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,666
Conan? Ran Mouri?

244
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,566
Dad?

245
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:18,766
Which means, you must be Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

246
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,966
I brought him here because I heard that you were a big fan of his.

247
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,566
I'm delighted!

248
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,266
Why...

249
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:30,466
It's hard to believe that Ebizo is a fan of Pops.

250
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,366
There...

251
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:36,066
I'm a super mystery fan.

252
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,766
When I went to perform in London,

253
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:40,966
I went to Baker Street every chance I had.

254
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,366
I've always respected and admired

255
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:47,166
the deductive skills of the Sleeping Kogoro.

256
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,766
Yes. All the admiration is quite a problem, you see.

257
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,566
Pops, your Japanese doesn't sound right.

258
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,566
Conan.

259
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:58,266
-I know about you too. -Yes?

260
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:02,466
I remember clearly when you beat Thief Kid!

261
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,866
I'm sure you'll be a great detective in the future too.

262
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,066
Wow! I hope so.

263
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,866
About your question a while ago...

264
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:14,566
Of why I chose the Seven Masks.

265
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:15,666
Yes.

266
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,166
People possess many aspects, don't they?

267
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:25,166
I want to express kindness, anger, envy and so forth.

268
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,666
In other words, I guess the mystery human beings.

269
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,066
That's wonderful.

270
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,766
We'll be going over to the practice hall now.

271
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:36,166
Mr. Mouri, would all of you like to come too?

272
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,766
We'd like to excuse ourselves.

273
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,466
We'd really love to.

274
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,666
Okay...

275
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,066
Ran, he's going to faint.

276
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,166
Interesting!

277
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,666
Let me take this, then.

278
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,466
Is the practice hall in another building?

279
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,966
No, it's in this Kabukiza on the upper floor.

280
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,566
It's here.

281
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,866
"Practice Hall"

282
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,666
The floor is sparkling.

283
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,366
-Good morning. -Good morning...

284
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:19,266
I'm going to go put this in the locker.

285
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,966
Yeah, thanks.

286
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:28,366
-Good morning. -Good morning.

287
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,866
Are there guests over today?

288
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:41,866
It's the great Detective Kogoro Mouri.

289
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,966
Kogoro Mouri, you mean the Sleeping Kogoro?

290
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:47,366
What brings the great detective here?

291
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,066
Was there a murder?

292
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:52,166
Cut it out. He's just here to watch.

293
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,666
Turn towards me, then stand up.

294
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,766
Yes, sir. Do I say my lines after that?

295
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,666
Yeah, after you've braced yourself standing up.

296
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,666
And this line here.

297
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,966
I'd like you to threaten me a bit more.

298
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,966
You were kind just now, weren't you?

299
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,566
Yes, sir. I'll think about it.

300
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:13,966
Does the story of Kabuki keep getting newer?

301
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,466
Do you know the star system?

302
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:17,866
The most important thing in Kabuki

303
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,866
is to bring out the actor's skill and attractiveness

304
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,866
to make it a true Ebizo performance.

305
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,866
We work on the script and performance together too.

306
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,066
So, everything is always new.

307
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,666
Brand new.

308
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,066
Of course, it's done by

309
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:34,366
maintaining the traditional ways of the Ichikawa school.

310
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,866
President.

311
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:41,066
Don't get in the way of the actors.

312
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,166
I'm no amateur.

313
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,566
Hey... It's too late for that.

314
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,866
I'm already this involved.

315
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,466
Don't be stingy and tell me.

316
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,166
Oh, boy. Like always,

317
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,966
it's not for me to decide.

318
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,966
Is it Mr. Mouri?

319
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:02,066
Megure here.

320
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,866
In... Inspector!

321
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:06,066
I just got it from forensics.

322
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:09,366
There were several prints found in the car.

323
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,166
-Are you sure it's okay? -Shouldn't I?

324
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,166
No, please go on ahead.

325
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,666
So the brake hose was...

326
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,866
If it was deliberately tampered with,

327
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:22,666
it was to commit murder.

328
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,366
It's most natural to think so.

329
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:27,266
I'd like to check the garage of his residence.

330
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,266
If you're with him, please bring him over.

331
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,066
Roger, boss.

332
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,666
Mr. Hosoo. I was contacted by the police.

333
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,066
And they told me they'd like to talk to you at your residence.

334
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,366
-Hurry, to the hospital! -Are you all right?

335
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:43,666
Iwami? What's the matter?

336
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,666
He suddenly started suffering.

337
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,766
Anyway, we'll rush him over to the hospital.

338
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,566
Good. Takahashi, take our car.

339
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,566
Yes, sir.

340
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,366
Maybe it was too much of a burden for Iwami.

341
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:57,966
He may be an up-and coming playwright,

342
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:02,166
but it's impossible for him to rewrite a new Kabuki version of Seven Masks.

343
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,166
I'm the one who chose Iwami.

344
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,866
I believe in his gift.

345
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,166
I see. I'm sorry.

346
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,766
As you can see, let's call it a day.

347
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:16,766
-Yes, sir. -Yes.

348
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,066
-Good work. -Have a nice day.

349
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,966
Conan.

350
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:21,966
Did you become interested in Kabuki?

351
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:25,466
Yes, I'm really interested.

352
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,166
Won't you like to come again, Conan?

353
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,166
Yes, I'd like to come again.

354
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,266
Is it okay, Ebizo?

355
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:33,966
Sure.

356
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,666
Come over again.

357
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:42,466
He is indeed Ebizo the 11th.

358
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,466
He's in a class of his own.

359
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,066
I was at the office last night

360
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:55,466
finished talking over arrangements and went home.

361
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,766
Did you ride the same car, back then?

362
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:01,166
Yes, my secretary Takahashi drove, though.

363
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,966
I'll stop over at Ebizo's before going to work tomorrow.

364
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:16,766
So, use the van, will you?

365
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,666
Okay.

366
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,966
Whenever I go home by car,

367
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:24,466
it's Takahashi's job to clean the interior and then leave.

368
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,566
How long did Mr. Takahashi stay after that?

369
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,466
I was in my study,

370
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:32,066
so I have no idea when Takahashi left.

371
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,966
No goodbyes?

372
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,466
How about the security camera?

373
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:39,266
The camera over there shows this place.

374
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,166
-Everything's recorded? -Of course.

375
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,966
May we take a look at it?

376
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,766
Please come this way.

377
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:48,066
It's saved on the hard disk,

378
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:51,366
so there are 72 hours left on all 10 cameras.

379
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:52,866
Conan.

380
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:56,166
Let's go home because we should keep out of the way.

381
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,666
I thought so.

382
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:04,266
This is sure a gorgeous house.

383
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,666
I'd like to live in it.

384
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,466
Cleaning up will be hassle, Ran.

385
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:09,566
Right.

386
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:12,666
I know nobody'll be around to help me anyway.

387
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,166
A convenience store.

388
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,366
If over there...

389
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,666
If I were to live there,

390
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,166
I would need a maid to help me clean.

391
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,366
You're still thinking about it?

392
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:34,966
Hello? Yes, I'm awake.

393
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:38,566
You called because you thought I was, right?

394
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,166
Yes. I got it.

395
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,866
I'll check on it for you.

396
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:46,566
I'll be fine. I got ways to do it.

397
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,766
Stop bugging me.

398
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:51,666
Don't you want the information?

399
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,366
I've already done that.

400
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,666
What about the cameraman?

401
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:59,266
Okay.

402
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,566
Got it. The playwright too.

403
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:04,866
I'll send it to your smartphone by morning.

404
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,766
Just what're you talking about?

405
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,566
I'm not interested.

406
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:10,366
Yes, goodnight.

407
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,366
"Ebizo"

408
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,966
What shall I wear?

409
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,666
Good morning.

410
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,266
President, good morning.

411
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,466
You're early.

412
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,666
We've got practice from morning today,

413
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,766
so I've got a lot to do before the props come in.

414
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:38,366
Pretty tough day then.

415
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:39,866
What the...

416
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,366
What... what's wrong?

417
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:44,566
It's gone!

418
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:49,166
The two-faced mask that I left in here is gone!
