1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
Dad.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
Are you sure this is the right road?

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
Yeah.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,940
Don't tell me you're lost?

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,340
Shut up. Rural roads are too dark to begin with!

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,140
Dad! In front!

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,340
Gosh! Who parked in a place like this?

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,540
I'll get the guy!

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,840
Come on, Dad. Cut it out.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,640
Pops, over there!

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,540
No good, she's dead.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,940
This is...

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
A dying message?

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,140
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,840
are slashed by the light of deduction.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,340
An unexpected reaction to text mail

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,640
disclose the full picture of the alibi trick.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,740
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:58,894
"The Mail of Happiness Brings Misfortune"

22
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:07,394
The victim is Ms. Nana Hirose, age 27.

23
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:10,394
She is an insurance lady who lives nearby.

24
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,194
It seems that she was attacked

25
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,594
when she dropped by after work in this park.

26
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,694
The cause of death is strangulation of the carotid artery.

27
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:20,394
The perp seems to have choked her many times

28
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:23,594
to make sure she died.

29
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:26,994
She had many strangulation marks on her neck, you see.

30
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:30,294
And what was the estimate time of death?

31
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,294
Between 22:00 and 22:30.

32
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:36,294
It was just slightly earlier than when we arrived here.

33
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:39,194
Are you sure you didn't witness anything?

34
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,494
No, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:44,294
If we witnessed anything, we would've told you long ago.

36
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,794
I guess so. But no need to worry.

37
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:51,894
The victim made sure she wrote a dying message, you see!

38
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,794
The perp is someone whose name begins with

39
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,894
the katakana character "na".

40
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:58,894
Come to think of it, the name of the victim

41
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:00,094
is also "nana" written in Katakana.

42
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,994
I get it! The perp is herself!

43
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,594
In other words, she committed suicide!

44
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:07,694
I'm sure the victim had a dual personality.

45
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:12,794
But there's something strange about it.

46
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,994
Besides, this smell...

47
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:19,994
No, Conan. Don't go near the corpse.

48
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:24,294
There's a strange smell coming from this lady's clothes.

49
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:26,194
What?

50
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,294
True.

51
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,594
It smells like gunpowder.

52
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:32,894
Why don't you have forensics check on it?

53
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,394
I was just thinking that.

54
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:36,694
Huh? Her hair's wet

55
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,394
and a bit of her make-up has come off.

56
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:41,094
I was just about to check on that, too.

57
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,794
Nana!

58
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,494
Nana! Please let me go!

59
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,994
Nana!

60
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,894
-Who is it? -I wonder.

61
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:51,394
He looks to be an acquaintance of the victim, though.

62
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,394
"Osamu Samon (27)" -I'm Osamu Samon.

63
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:01,494
I'm an elementary school teacher and teach Japanese.

64
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:04,694
And what is your connection with the victim Ms. Hirose?

65
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:06,394
Yes.

66
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,794
She and I were engaged.

67
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:11,294
I see.

68
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:12,994
Then, do you know if there were any changes

69
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:15,494
that you noticed about Ms. Hirose?

70
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:20,294
The thing is, I was supposed to have dinner with Nana tonight,

71
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:24,194
but I got this text mail from Nana.

72
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:25,794
"I'm going to be a bit late.

73
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:29,694
I'm going to be seeing Migita at the park. Nana."

74
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,694
Mail receipt is at 21:45.

75
00:05:32,694 --> 00:05:35,694
A little before her estimated time of death.

76
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:38,694
Who's this "Migita" person?

77
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:41,994
The man who was going with Nana before me.

78
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:44,294
Migita was trying to get Nana back

79
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:46,594
and persistently bugging her.

80
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:49,194
That's why... maybe...

81
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,794
I see! I get it!

82
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:53,794
Mr. Samon.

83
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,394
The name Migita, is it written "migi" meaning right,

84
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:56,394
as in right and "hidari" left?

85
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:59,894
Then followed by the next kanji character, "ta" meaning field?

86
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,294
Yes, that's correct.

87
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:03,794
In other words,

88
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,894
the victim did not write the katakana character "na".

89
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:08,894
Rather, she tried to write the kanji character "migi"

90
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:11,794
but died before doing so.

91
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:15,094
I see! Just as would be expected of you, Mr. Mouri!

92
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:22,094
At any rate, let's go to Migita's place.

93
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:24,294
Please let me go with you.

94
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,094
No, but...

95
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,194
Please. No matter how small,

96
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:30,994
I'd like to help out with the investigation.

97
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:32,794
I've got no choice.

98
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:36,094
Promise me that you won't get in the way of the investigation, then.

99
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,694
I understand.

100
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,894
Are they your students?

101
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,094
That's right.

102
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:51,594
They held a wedding party for me today.

103
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,494
What good students.

104
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:54,794
Yes.

105
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,894
I don't know what to say to them, too.

106
00:06:59,194 --> 00:07:00,794
Did you notice?

107
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:01,894
That's correct.

108
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:05,594
My name is written "Samon" in kanji.

109
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:08,094
So, it also could be a part of the dying message.

110
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:14,194
Yes, of course, I've already noticed that

111
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:17,094
you could be a suspect, too.

112
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:21,794
"Migita Bookstore"

113
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:23,194
Huh?

114
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,394
"Toshihiko Migita (32), Bookstore Owner" -Nana was killed?

115
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:26,694
Is that true?

116
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:31,094
Yes, at the park that she was scheduled to see you at tonight.

117
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:32,294
Cut out the joke!

118
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,894
I wasn't scheduled to see her at all!

119
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:37,994
But, what's with this mail?

120
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,994
I have no idea.

121
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,694
She probably used it as an excuse

122
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,294
to go see another man or something.

123
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,294
That's not the only thing.

124
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:49,694
The victim left behind a dying message.

125
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:56,494
The victim tried to write your name Mr. Migita

126
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:59,594
and died in the process.

127
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:02,694
No, it's doesn't necessarily have to be so.

128
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:06,194
Maybe it's true that Nana tried to write the character "migi".

129
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:11,094
But it could be "na" written in katakana

130
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:12,694
or the kanji character "dai"

131
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:15,194
or it could even be "inu".

132
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,394
-True. -Right, right.

133
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:20,494
Even if you were to try to write his name "Samon",

134
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:21,894
it would turn out this way, wouldn't it?

135
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:24,694
Oh my, true.

136
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:25,894
In the first place,

137
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:28,494
it was impossible for me to commit the crime.

138
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:31,194
Because I've got a perfect alibi.

139
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:39,294
I was working all night here.

140
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:42,494
I'm sure I can prove that using the surveillance camera.

141
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:45,994
I think it's right around here.

142
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:48,394
I'm glad I had it installed.

143
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,494
It's true that he's displayed on the surveillance camera right through.

144
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:52,994
He's gone!

145
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:59,094
But he came back right away.

146
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:01,294
I mean, I gotta go to the john too, you know.

147
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:04,094
I mean, that brings on confusion.

148
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:10,194
I see.

149
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:13,094
So, the only time you, Mr. Migita, went out of view of the camera

150
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,294
was when you went to the restroom.

151
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,594
From here to the site of the crime,

152
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:21,294
even if you were to go by car, it would take about 2 hours round trip.

153
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,494
It would have been impossible for him to commit the crime.

154
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,094
So now you know.

155
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:29,494
I have a perfect alibi, you see.

156
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:33,094
It's true that at first glance, it looks to be a perfect alibi,

157
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,394
but what happened a while ago?

158
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:36,994
I see.

159
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:41,594
So, the perp is you, Mr. Samon!

160
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,294
Why?

161
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:46,194
There's no reason for me killing Nana, is there?

162
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:50,394
To begin with, I didn't even get to see Nana today!

163
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,594
Then, do you have an alibi?

164
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:53,994
Well...

165
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:57,594
It's possible that you made that mail up

166
00:09:57,594 --> 00:10:00,994
to frame Mr. Migita, too.

167
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,494
No way.

168
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:07,194
No. The dying message points to Mr. Migita.

169
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:09,094
Besides, that image...

170
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,494
But just that, wouldn't serve as evidence.

171
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,894
What's this?

172
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,594
This is maybe...

173
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:39,328
"Migita Bookstore"

174
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:43,928
Anyway, we'll get the details from you at the station.

175
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,228
Why? I didn't do it.

176
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,628
Yes, yes, all perps say that!

177
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:51,328
No, I...

178
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,428
Let's go, let's.

179
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:55,828
No...

180
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,728
Oh, my...

181
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,728
Don't tell me that...

182
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,628
You've become the Sleeping Kogoro!

183
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:08,228
Dad?

184
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:11,928
The person that the dying message of the victim is pointing to

185
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,128
is not Mr. Samon.

186
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:16,728
Mr. Migita, it's you.

187
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,228
How can you say something like that?

188
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,228
Mr. Mouri.

189
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,428
It's true that it's hard to tell

190
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:26,828
whether the perp wanted to write "migi" or "hidari".

191
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:28,528
The thing is you can tell...

192
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:31,428
-Hey, Conan. -Yes.

193
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,728
Mr. Samon, this.

194
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:37,328
You're an Elementary School teacher, aren't you?

195
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,728
Will you please write the character "migi" here

196
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:41,328
so that everyone can see?

197
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:42,528
Yeah.

198
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,128
So the character "migi" is written in the stroke order

199
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:51,728
of the first tapered part "no" followed by the horizontal line.

200
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,928
Please look at the part where the tapered line

201
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,928
and the horizontal line intersects.

202
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,128
It is obvious that

203
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:04,728
horizontal line was written after the tapered line.

204
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:07,728
That's true.

205
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,828
It is neither the katakana character "na" nor "hidari".

206
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,628
The way the character is written, the stroke order shows that

207
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:14,928
it is written in this order only when writing the character "migi".

208
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:18,028
Only that can't possibly serve as proof.

209
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,028
Besides, did you forget?

210
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:22,428
I've got a perfect alibi.

211
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:23,928
That's right.

212
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:27,428
Mr. Migita was displayed on the surveillance camera right through.

213
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,328
It's true he was there

214
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,828
while the surveillance camera was operating.

215
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:32,328
What?

216
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,228
Right. We all have the stereotyped idea

217
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:39,928
that a surveillance camera is continuously operating.

218
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,928
Mr. Migita used this to his advantage.

219
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,528
Back then, when you said you went off to use the restroom,

220
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:49,128
you switched off the surveillance camera.

221
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,728
Then, you went to the scene of the crime

222
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,828
in 10 minutes on your scooter

223
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,228
and killed Nana.

224
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:05,228
Mr. Migita then returns in 10 minutes

225
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:09,028
and switches the surveillance camera back on,

226
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:12,028
sitting within the visual range of the camera.

227
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,428
In that way,

228
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,528
you actually made the image look to be one continuous take

229
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:22,328
although you were gone for more than 20 minutes.

230
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:24,328
The surveillance camera of this store

231
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:27,228
is the type that doesn't display time.

232
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,428
So, it would be easy to make up a story.

233
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:31,928
Then, it was you after all who...

234
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:34,028
Where's the proof?

235
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:37,028
Where's the proof to support that I did something like that?

236
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:40,328
It's all right. Please come in.

237
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:46,028
He's a student who lives nearby.

238
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,828
Please tell us what you witnessed.

239
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,928
Yes, sir.

240
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:53,628
It was around 22:30.

241
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:55,528
The program that I wanted to watch was about to start,

242
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:57,128
so I was about to switch on the TV.

243
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,928
Then...

244
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:13,128
I see. It's true that it was 22:30 tonight.

245
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:16,128
It was probably somebody driving under the influence of alcohol.

246
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:18,828
I'm sure we can find it if we look around this vicinity.

247
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:23,028
It's a white car with a broke headlight.

248
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,128
I'm sure that there was a pretty loud noise

249
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,828
echoing through inside the store, too.

250
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:29,028
However, in the image we just saw,

251
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:31,828
there was no part where you seemed to notice anything.

252
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,428
Why?

253
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:36,628
Because the scene from that time span is missing.

254
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:39,428
22:30 is the time when the crime was committed.

255
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:44,528
Mr. Migita, you weren't in this store at that time.

256
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,328
Darn it!

257
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:50,028
I thought I totally deceived everyone and yet...

258
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,828
It's your hair!

259
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:54,128
My hair?

260
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,328
Your naturally curly hair that you had

261
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,228
until you left to go to the restroom,

262
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:01,828
when you came back was flattened out.

263
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:05,628
Just as if you had worn a helmet or something.

264
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:08,128
When I saw that,

265
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:10,428
I realized what your trick was about.

266
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,928
She... Nana's to blame.

267
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,928
"I'm happy." -She kept sending me images like this

268
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:20,028
"I got engaged." -to get on my nerves.

269
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,528
Darn it!

270
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,428
Moreover, that woman had the nerve to say

271
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,628
she didn't do anything like that.

272
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:35,028
She dare made fun of me!

273
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,828
Just as I thought. The rest is...

274
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:44,128
Yes?

275
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:47,428
Huh? Gunpowder residue?

276
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:48,728
It's okay, okay already,

277
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:51,528
because we've already arrested the perp.

278
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,328
Good work.

279
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,728
Maybe gunpowder residue

280
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,728
was detected on the clothing of the corpse?

281
00:15:57,728 --> 00:16:00,028
Huh? I'm amazed, you know!

282
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,928
Okay! Everything fit in now.

283
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,028
Are you talking about

284
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,328
the thing that is detected when a gun is fired?

285
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:10,228
-Yes. -Hey! I didn't use a gun!

286
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,028
I know,

287
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,628
because the victim's cause of death was strangulation.

288
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:18,128
But why was there gunpowder residue on her?

289
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,528
It must be some kind of mistake.

290
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:23,228
I don't think it has anything to do with the case.

291
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:26,528
Oh, well.

292
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,928
Okay, Mr. Migita, let's go to the station.

293
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:30,728
Wait a minute, please.

294
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,828
The case isn't over yet.

295
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,628
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

296
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,828
The perp is right here.

297
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:40,928
Yes, of course Mr. Migita is the perp

298
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:44,228
that is for allegedly trying to kill Nana, right?

299
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:46,328
Alleged homicide?

300
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,228
-Then... -Yeah.

301
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,128
The real perp is another person!

302
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,428
Huh?

303
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,728
The real perp who killed Ms. Nana Hirose is...

304
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:56,028
That is...

305
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:59,328
Mr. Osamu Samon, you, is it not?

306
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:04,528
Detective. I'm not trying to protect him or anything,

307
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,128
but I killed Nana with my very hands.

308
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,428
Right!

309
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,028
Besides, the stroke order of the dying message

310
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,228
points to Mr. Migita, didn't you say?

311
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:16,628
The stroke order is the very thing that is indicating

312
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:19,928
that the one who wrote the dying message is not Nana,

313
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,728
-but Mr. Samon. -What?

314
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:25,328
First, for that dying message...

315
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,928
It's unthinkable that Nana would've written it.

316
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,228
As far as I've read her mails,

317
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:35,928
she always wrote Mr. Migita's name in katakana characters.

318
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:39,228
So, I wonder if she, at the verge of dying

319
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:42,328
would suddenly write his name in kanji characters.

320
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:45,328
I see. It is unnatural.

321
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:48,128
But even so, you can't say that I wrote it.

322
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:51,928
No. The possibility that you did is extremely high!

323
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,228
What?

324
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:54,828
Please recall the stroke order

325
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:59,128
of when Mr. Migita wrote the kanji character "migi"

326
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:02,628
and the stroke order of when Mr. Samon who is a teacher,

327
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:05,728
wrote the word.

328
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:08,028
But I know what I did...

329
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,528
Let me give you an orderly explanation.

330
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,428
First of all, Mr. Samon's plan was

331
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,628
to keep sending Mr. Migita obnoxious mails

332
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,628
from Nana's smart phone to start with.

333
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,928
Mr. Samon, who was aware of Mr. Migita's personality,

334
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:24,128
and his distorted love for her worked it out

335
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:28,928
so that Mr. Migita would attempt to kill her.

336
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:31,128
How unpleasant.

337
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,528
How can you say something like that?

338
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,428
The writing style.

339
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,928
The writing style?

340
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:39,528
In the mail that Nana herself had written,

341
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:42,128
there are no punctuation marks,

342
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:46,928
and at the end of the mail, she always inserts her name "Nana."

343
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,828
But in the mail that was written to get Mr. Migita angry

344
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,128
there were punctuation marks,

345
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:54,628
but no signature "Nana."

346
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:56,528
The writing style that a person usually uses

347
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,728
cannot be changed that easily.

348
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:01,428
Just like a person's stroke order.

349
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:04,628
It's apparent that someone else wrote it.

350
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:08,128
And the plan actually worked out.

351
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:09,828
As you had figured out it to be,

352
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:11,628
Mr. Migita who was angered with the hate

353
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:15,628
that built up inside of him, killed her.

354
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,928
At the park you went to confirm the chain of events,

355
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:20,528
when you found Nana lying on the ground,

356
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,928
I'm sure that you were convinced

357
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,828
that your scheme worked out.

358
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:29,728
However, something you didn't expect happened.

359
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,928
When Mr. Migita left the crime scene,

360
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:35,628
she was probably still just in a temporary state of apparent death.

361
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:38,328
Nana revived.

362
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:41,728
Back then, Nana in order to wash the soil off her face,

363
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,928
washed her face using the water from the faucet.

364
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:45,428
The face of the corpse was wet

365
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:48,328
and her make-up was removed because of this.

366
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:52,128
Then, immediately afterwards, she was finished off

367
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:54,328
by you.

368
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,528
Furthermore, you used the finger of the corpse

369
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,428
and tried to write the word "Migita" on the ground.

370
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:01,928
However, while you were in the process,

371
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:04,128
you noticed us approaching

372
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:07,028
and had no choice but to leave the scene.

373
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,128
This is the truth of what happened.

374
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:15,328
It's true that everything falls into place,

375
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,728
but all you mentioned is circumstantial evidence.

376
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:19,528
You have no concrete evidence.

377
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:21,428
I've got concrete proof.

378
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,628
Huh?

379
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:26,428
The gunpowder residue that was found on the clothes of the corpse.

380
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,328
Gunpowder residue?

381
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,228
Why was gunpowder residue found at the site

382
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,628
when no gun was used?

383
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,528
The answer was found in the image inside your smart phone.

384
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,228
Just what do you mean?

385
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:42,328
In the image you were being congratulated

386
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,328
with a lot of party crackers.

387
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,028
As you can tell from what sounds to be the sound of gun fire,

388
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:51,428
the party crackers leave gunpowder residue behind when used.

389
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:54,828
And this gunpowder residue that was left on your clothes back then

390
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,828
also ended up being on Nana's clothes

391
00:20:56,828 --> 00:21:00,028
when you strangled her to death.

392
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:02,328
I'm sure that investigation will show

393
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,528
that the same gunpowder residue that was on her clothes,

394
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:10,428
would also be found on your clothes, too.

395
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,128
Can you explain this?

396
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:13,328
Why would the same gunpowder residue be found

397
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,028
on both your clothes and Nana's

398
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:17,928
when you didn't even see her?

399
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,628
How ironic.

400
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,828
To think that the children congratulating me

401
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,028
would serve as proof...

402
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,928
But, why did you kill Nana?

403
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:33,728
You two looked so happy together.

404
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:37,128
Your motive was that Nana had called off the engagement, no?

405
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:38,728
How do you know?

406
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:40,528
The ring.

407
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:42,028
You're wearing an engagement

408
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:44,028
on the middle finger of your right hand.

409
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:47,828
But there was no ring on Nana's finger.

410
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,928
That's when I realized

411
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:53,428
that your feelings for her were just a one-sided thing.

412
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,728
I couldn't take it.

413
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:59,928
As long as Nana was alive,

414
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:03,728
I would continue to keep feeling miserable.

415
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,628
I just couldn't bear the thought.

416
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:36,028
I hope we're really supposed to take a right here?

417
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,228
I think so.

418
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:40,128
If you say so, I'm sure we should go left.

419
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,228
How rude!

420
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:43,528
It's a right, go right! It's definitely a right!

421
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,928
No, it's a left. Definitely a left, left it is.

422
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,528
-Go right! -A left!

423
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,228
Who cares which way it is.

424
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,928
I just want to get home quickly.

425
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:55,628

All's fine if I get to see Yoko!

440

Whatevers.
