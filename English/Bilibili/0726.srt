1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.440
Dad.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.440
Are you sure this is the right road?

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.940
Don't tell me you're lost?

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.340
Shut up. Rural roads are too dark to begin with!

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.140
Dad! In front!

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.340
Gosh! Who parked in a place like this?

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.540
I'll get the guy!

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.840
Come on, Dad. Cut it out.

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.640
Pops, over there!

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.540
No good, she's dead.

12
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.940
This is...

13
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.440
A dying message?

14
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.140
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

15
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.840
are slashed by the light of deduction.

16
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.340
An unexpected reaction to text mail

17
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.640
disclose the full picture of the alibi trick.

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.740
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:58.894
"The Mail of Happiness Brings Misfortune"

22
00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:07.394
The victim is Ms. Nana Hirose, age 27.

23
00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:10.394
She is an insurance lady who lives nearby.

24
00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:13.194
It seems that she was attacked

25
00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:15.594
when she dropped by after work in this park.

26
00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:18.694
The cause of death is strangulation of the carotid artery.

27
00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:20.394
The perp seems to have choked her many times

28
00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:23.594
to make sure she died.

29
00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:26.994
She had many strangulation marks on her neck, you see.

30
00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:30.294
And what was the estimate time of death?

31
00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.294
Between 22:00 and 22:30.

32
00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:36.294
It was just slightly earlier than when we arrived here.

33
00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:39.194
Are you sure you didn't witness anything?

34
00:03:39.194 --> 00:03:41.494
No, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:44.294
If we witnessed anything, we would've told you long ago.

36
00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:46.794
I guess so. But no need to worry.

37
00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:51.894
The victim made sure she wrote a dying message, you see!

38
00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:53.794
The perp is someone whose name begins with

39
00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:55.894
the katakana character "na".

40
00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:58.894
Come to think of it, the name of the victim

41
00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:00.094
is also "nana" written in Katakana.

42
00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:02.994
I get it! The perp is herself!

43
00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:04.594
In other words, she committed suicide!

44
00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.694
I'm sure the victim had a dual personality.

45
00:04:08.794 --> 00:04:12.794
But there's something strange about it.

46
00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:16.994
Besides, this smell...

47
00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:19.994
No, Conan. Don't go near the corpse.

48
00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:24.294
There's a strange smell coming from this lady's clothes.

49
00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:26.194
What?

50
00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:28.294
True.

51
00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:29.594
It smells like gunpowder.

52
00:04:29.594 --> 00:04:32.894
Why don't you have forensics check on it?

53
00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:34.394
I was just thinking that.

54
00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.694
Huh? Her hair's wet

55
00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:39.394
and a bit of her make-up has come off.

56
00:04:39.394 --> 00:04:41.094
I was just about to check on that, too.

57
00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:42.794
Nana!

58
00:04:42.794 --> 00:04:45.494
Nana! Please let me go!

59
00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:46.994
Nana!

60
00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:48.894
-Who is it? -I wonder.

61
00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:51.394
He looks to be an acquaintance of the victim, though.

62
00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:58.394
"Osamu Samon (27)" -I'm Osamu Samon.

63
00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:01.494
I'm an elementary school teacher and teach Japanese.

64
00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:04.694
And what is your connection with the victim Ms. Hirose?

65
00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:06.394
Yes.

66
00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:09.794
She and I were engaged.

67
00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:11.294
I see.

68
00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:12.994
Then, do you know if there were any changes

69
00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:15.494
that you noticed about Ms. Hirose?

70
00:05:15.494 --> 00:05:20.294
The thing is, I was supposed to have dinner with Nana tonight,

71
00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:24.194
but I got this text mail from Nana.

72
00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:25.794
"I'm going to be a bit late.

73
00:05:25.794 --> 00:05:29.694
I'm going to be seeing Migita at the park. Nana."

74
00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:32.694
Mail receipt is at 21:45.

75
00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:35.694
A little before her estimated time of death.

76
00:05:35.694 --> 00:05:38.694
Who's this "Migita" person?

77
00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:41.994
The man who was going with Nana before me.

78
00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:44.294
Migita was trying to get Nana back

79
00:05:44.294 --> 00:05:46.594
and persistently bugging her.

80
00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:49.194
That's why... maybe...

81
00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:52.794
I see! I get it!

82
00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:53.794
Mr. Samon.

83
00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:55.394
The name Migita, is it written "migi" meaning right,

84
00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:56.394
as in right and "hidari" left?

85
00:05:56.394 --> 00:05:59.894
Then followed by the next kanji character, "ta" meaning field?

86
00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:02.294
Yes, that's correct.

87
00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:03.794
In other words,

88
00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:06.894
the victim did not write the katakana character "na".

89
00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:08.894
Rather, she tried to write the kanji character "migi"

90
00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:11.794
but died before doing so.

91
00:06:11.794 --> 00:06:15.094
I see! Just as would be expected of you, Mr. Mouri!

92
00:06:19.294 --> 00:06:22.094
At any rate, let's go to Migita's place.

93
00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:24.294
Please let me go with you.

94
00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:26.094
No, but...

95
00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.194
Please. No matter how small,

96
00:06:28.194 --> 00:06:30.994
I'd like to help out with the investigation.

97
00:06:30.994 --> 00:06:32.794
I've got no choice.

98
00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:36.094
Promise me that you won't get in the way of the investigation, then.

99
00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:37.694
I understand.

100
00:06:44.894 --> 00:06:46.894
Are they your students?

101
00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:48.094
That's right.

102
00:06:48.094 --> 00:06:51.594
They held a wedding party for me today.

103
00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:53.494
What good students.

104
00:06:53.494 --> 00:06:54.794
Yes.

105
00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:57.894
I don't know what to say to them, too.

106
00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:00.794
Did you notice?

107
00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:01.894
That's correct.

108
00:07:01.894 --> 00:07:05.594
My name is written "Samon" in kanji.

109
00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:08.094
So, it also could be a part of the dying message.

110
00:07:11.194 --> 00:07:14.194
Yes, of course, I've already noticed that

111
00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:17.094
you could be a suspect, too.

112
00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:21.794
"Migita Bookstore"

113
00:07:21.794 --> 00:07:23.194
Huh?

114
00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:25.394
"Toshihiko Migita (32), Bookstore Owner" -Nana was killed?

115
00:07:25.394 --> 00:07:26.694
Is that true?

116
00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:31.094
Yes, at the park that she was scheduled to see you at tonight.

117
00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:32.294
Cut out the joke!

118
00:07:32.294 --> 00:07:34.894
I wasn't scheduled to see her at all!

119
00:07:34.894 --> 00:07:37.994
But, what's with this mail?

120
00:07:37.994 --> 00:07:39.994
I have no idea.

121
00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:42.694
She probably used it as an excuse

122
00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:44.294
to go see another man or something.

123
00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:46.294
That's not the only thing.

124
00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:49.694
The victim left behind a dying message.

125
00:07:49.694 --> 00:07:56.494
The victim tried to write your name Mr. Migita

126
00:07:56.494 --> 00:07:59.594
and died in the process.

127
00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:02.694
No, it's doesn't necessarily have to be so.

128
00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:06.194
Maybe it's true that Nana tried to write the character "migi".

129
00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:11.094
But it could be "na" written in katakana

130
00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:12.694
or the kanji character "dai"

131
00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:15.194
or it could even be "inu".

132
00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.394
-True. -Right, right.

133
00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:20.494
Even if you were to try to write his name "Samon",

134
00:08:20.494 --> 00:08:21.894
it would turn out this way, wouldn't it?

135
00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:24.694
Oh my, true.

136
00:08:24.694 --> 00:08:25.894
In the first place,

137
00:08:25.894 --> 00:08:28.494
it was impossible for me to commit the crime.

138
00:08:28.494 --> 00:08:31.194
Because I've got a perfect alibi.

139
00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:39.294
I was working all night here.

140
00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:42.494
I'm sure I can prove that using the surveillance camera.

141
00:08:44.294 --> 00:08:45.994
I think it's right around here.

142
00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:48.394
I'm glad I had it installed.

143
00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.494
It's true that he's displayed on the surveillance camera right through.

144
00:08:51.494 --> 00:08:52.994
He's gone!

145
00:08:56.094 --> 00:08:59.094
But he came back right away.

146
00:08:59.094 --> 00:09:01.294
I mean, I gotta go to the john too, you know.

147
00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:04.094
I mean, that brings on confusion.

148
00:09:08.794 --> 00:09:10.194
I see.

149
00:09:10.194 --> 00:09:13.094
So, the only time you, Mr. Migita, went out of view of the camera

150
00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.294
was when you went to the restroom.

151
00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:18.594
From here to the site of the crime,

152
00:09:18.594 --> 00:09:21.294
even if you were to go by car, it would take about 2 hours round trip.

153
00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:24.494
It would have been impossible for him to commit the crime.

154
00:09:24.494 --> 00:09:26.094
So now you know.

155
00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:29.494
I have a perfect alibi, you see.

156
00:09:29.494 --> 00:09:33.094
It's true that at first glance, it looks to be a perfect alibi,

157
00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:35.394
but what happened a while ago?

158
00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:36.994
I see.

159
00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:41.594
So, the perp is you, Mr. Samon!

160
00:09:41.594 --> 00:09:43.294
Why?

161
00:09:43.294 --> 00:09:46.194
There's no reason for me killing Nana, is there?

162
00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:50.394
To begin with, I didn't even get to see Nana today!

163
00:09:50.394 --> 00:09:52.594
Then, do you have an alibi?

164
00:09:52.594 --> 00:09:53.994
Well...

165
00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:57.594
It's possible that you made that mail up

166
00:09:57.594 --> 00:10:00.994
to frame Mr. Migita, too.

167
00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:02.494
No way.

168
00:10:02.494 --> 00:10:07.194
No. The dying message points to Mr. Migita.

169
00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:09.094
Besides, that image...

170
00:10:09.094 --> 00:10:11.494
But just that, wouldn't serve as evidence.

171
00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:26.894
What's this?

172
00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.594
This is maybe...

173
00:10:37.728 --> 00:10:39.328
"Migita Bookstore"

174
00:10:39.328 --> 00:10:43.928
Anyway, we'll get the details from you at the station.

175
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.228
Why? I didn't do it.

176
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:49.628
Yes, yes, all perps say that!

177
00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:51.328
No, I...

178
00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:53.428
Let's go, let's.

179
00:10:53.428 --> 00:10:55.828
No...

180
00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:02.728
Oh, my...

181
00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:04.728
Don't tell me that...

182
00:11:04.728 --> 00:11:06.628
You've become the Sleeping Kogoro!

183
00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:08.228
Dad?

184
00:11:08.228 --> 00:11:11.928
The person that the dying message of the victim is pointing to

185
00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:14.128
is not Mr. Samon.

186
00:11:14.128 --> 00:11:16.728
Mr. Migita, it's you.

187
00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:20.228
How can you say something like that?

188
00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:22.228
Mr. Mouri.

189
00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:23.428
It's true that it's hard to tell

190
00:11:23.428 --> 00:11:26.828
whether the perp wanted to write "migi" or "hidari".

191
00:11:26.828 --> 00:11:28.528
The thing is you can tell...

192
00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:31.428
-Hey, Conan. -Yes.

193
00:11:31.428 --> 00:11:33.728
Mr. Samon, this.

194
00:11:33.728 --> 00:11:37.328
You're an Elementary School teacher, aren't you?

195
00:11:37.328 --> 00:11:38.728
Will you please write the character "migi" here

196
00:11:38.728 --> 00:11:41.328
so that everyone can see?

197
00:11:41.328 --> 00:11:42.528
Yeah.

198
00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:49.128
So the character "migi" is written in the stroke order

199
00:11:49.128 --> 00:11:51.728
of the first tapered part "no" followed by the horizontal line.

200
00:11:56.228 --> 00:11:57.928
Please look at the part where the tapered line

201
00:11:57.928 --> 00:11:59.928
and the horizontal line intersects.

202
00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.128
It is obvious that

203
00:12:01.128 --> 00:12:04.728
horizontal line was written after the tapered line.

204
00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:07.728
That's true.

205
00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:10.828
It is neither the katakana character "na" nor "hidari".

206
00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:12.628
The way the character is written, the stroke order shows that

207
00:12:12.628 --> 00:12:14.928
it is written in this order only when writing the character "migi".

208
00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:18.028
Only that can't possibly serve as proof.

209
00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:20.028
Besides, did you forget?

210
00:12:20.028 --> 00:12:22.428
I've got a perfect alibi.

211
00:12:22.428 --> 00:12:23.928
That's right.

212
00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:27.428
Mr. Migita was displayed on the surveillance camera right through.

213
00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:29.328
It's true he was there

214
00:12:29.328 --> 00:12:30.828
while the surveillance camera was operating.

215
00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:32.328
What?

216
00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:36.228
Right. We all have the stereotyped idea

217
00:12:36.228 --> 00:12:39.928
that a surveillance camera is continuously operating.

218
00:12:39.928 --> 00:12:42.928
Mr. Migita used this to his advantage.

219
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:46.528
Back then, when you said you went off to use the restroom,

220
00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:49.128
you switched off the surveillance camera.

221
00:12:51.828 --> 00:12:53.728
Then, you went to the scene of the crime

222
00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:55.828
in 10 minutes on your scooter

223
00:12:55.828 --> 00:12:58.228
and killed Nana.

224
00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:05.228
Mr. Migita then returns in 10 minutes

225
00:13:05.228 --> 00:13:09.028
and switches the surveillance camera back on,

226
00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:12.028
sitting within the visual range of the camera.

227
00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:15.428
In that way,

228
00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:18.528
you actually made the image look to be one continuous take

229
00:13:18.528 --> 00:13:22.328
although you were gone for more than 20 minutes.

230
00:13:22.328 --> 00:13:24.328
The surveillance camera of this store

231
00:13:24.328 --> 00:13:27.228
is the type that doesn't display time.

232
00:13:27.228 --> 00:13:29.428
So, it would be easy to make up a story.

233
00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:31.928
Then, it was you after all who...

234
00:13:31.928 --> 00:13:34.028
Where's the proof?

235
00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:37.028
Where's the proof to support that I did something like that?

236
00:13:37.028 --> 00:13:40.328
It's all right. Please come in.

237
00:13:42.428 --> 00:13:46.028
He's a student who lives nearby.

238
00:13:46.028 --> 00:13:49.828
Please tell us what you witnessed.

239
00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:50.928
Yes, sir.

240
00:13:50.928 --> 00:13:53.628
It was around 22:30.

241
00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:55.528
The program that I wanted to watch was about to start,

242
00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:57.128
so I was about to switch on the TV.

243
00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.928
Then...

244
00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:13.128
I see. It's true that it was 22:30 tonight.

245
00:14:13.128 --> 00:14:16.128
It was probably somebody driving under the influence of alcohol.

246
00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:18.828
I'm sure we can find it if we look around this vicinity.

247
00:14:18.828 --> 00:14:23.028
It's a white car with a broke headlight.

248
00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.128
I'm sure that there was a pretty loud noise

249
00:14:25.128 --> 00:14:26.828
echoing through inside the store, too.

250
00:14:26.828 --> 00:14:29.028
However, in the image we just saw,

251
00:14:29.028 --> 00:14:31.828
there was no part where you seemed to notice anything.

252
00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:33.428
Why?

253
00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:36.628
Because the scene from that time span is missing.

254
00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:39.428
22:30 is the time when the crime was committed.

255
00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:44.528
Mr. Migita, you weren't in this store at that time.

256
00:14:45.628 --> 00:14:47.328
Darn it!

257
00:14:47.328 --> 00:14:50.028
I thought I totally deceived everyone and yet...

258
00:14:50.028 --> 00:14:52.828
It's your hair!

259
00:14:52.828 --> 00:14:54.128
My hair?

260
00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:56.328
Your naturally curly hair that you had

261
00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:58.228
until you left to go to the restroom,

262
00:14:58.228 --> 00:15:01.828
when you came back was flattened out.

263
00:15:01.828 --> 00:15:05.628
Just as if you had worn a helmet or something.

264
00:15:05.628 --> 00:15:08.128
When I saw that,

265
00:15:08.128 --> 00:15:10.428
I realized what your trick was about.

266
00:15:13.328 --> 00:15:15.928
She... Nana's to blame.

267
00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:17.928
"I'm happy." -She kept sending me images like this

268
00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:20.028
"I got engaged." -to get on my nerves.

269
00:15:20.728 --> 00:15:22.528
Darn it!

270
00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:30.428
Moreover, that woman had the nerve to say

271
00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:32.628
she didn't do anything like that.

272
00:15:32.628 --> 00:15:35.028
She dare made fun of me!

273
00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.828
Just as I thought. The rest is...

274
00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:44.128
Yes?

275
00:15:44.128 --> 00:15:47.428
Huh? Gunpowder residue?

276
00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:48.728
It's okay, okay already,

277
00:15:48.728 --> 00:15:51.528
because we've already arrested the perp.

278
00:15:51.528 --> 00:15:53.328
Good work.

279
00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:55.728
Maybe gunpowder residue

280
00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:57.728
was detected on the clothing of the corpse?

281
00:15:57.728 --> 00:16:00.028
Huh? I'm amazed, you know!

282
00:16:00.028 --> 00:16:02.928
Okay! Everything fit in now.

283
00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:04.028
Are you talking about

284
00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:06.328
the thing that is detected when a gun is fired?

285
00:16:06.328 --> 00:16:10.228
-Yes. -Hey! I didn't use a gun!

286
00:16:10.228 --> 00:16:12.028
I know,

287
00:16:12.028 --> 00:16:14.628
because the victim's cause of death was strangulation.

288
00:16:14.628 --> 00:16:18.128
But why was there gunpowder residue on her?

289
00:16:18.128 --> 00:16:20.528
It must be some kind of mistake.

290
00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:23.228
I don't think it has anything to do with the case.

291
00:16:24.628 --> 00:16:26.528
Oh, well.

292
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.928
Okay, Mr. Migita, let's go to the station.

293
00:16:28.928 --> 00:16:30.728
Wait a minute, please.

294
00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:32.828
The case isn't over yet.

295
00:16:32.828 --> 00:16:35.628
Just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

296
00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:37.828
The perp is right here.

297
00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:40.928
Yes, of course Mr. Migita is the perp

298
00:16:40.928 --> 00:16:44.228
that is for allegedly trying to kill Nana, right?

299
00:16:44.228 --> 00:16:46.328
Alleged homicide?

300
00:16:46.328 --> 00:16:48.228
-Then... -Yeah.

301
00:16:48.228 --> 00:16:50.128
The real perp is another person!

302
00:16:50.128 --> 00:16:51.428
Huh?

303
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:54.728
The real perp who killed Ms. Nana Hirose is...

304
00:16:54.728 --> 00:16:56.028
That is...

305
00:16:56.028 --> 00:16:59.328
Mr. Osamu Samon, you, is it not?

306
00:17:00.628 --> 00:17:04.528
Detective. I'm not trying to protect him or anything,

307
00:17:04.528 --> 00:17:07.128
but I killed Nana with my very hands.

308
00:17:07.128 --> 00:17:08.428
Right!

309
00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:11.028
Besides, the stroke order of the dying message

310
00:17:11.028 --> 00:17:13.228
points to Mr. Migita, didn't you say?

311
00:17:13.228 --> 00:17:16.628
The stroke order is the very thing that is indicating

312
00:17:16.628 --> 00:17:19.928
that the one who wrote the dying message is not Nana,

313
00:17:19.928 --> 00:17:22.728
-but Mr. Samon. -What?

314
00:17:22.728 --> 00:17:25.328
First, for that dying message...

315
00:17:25.328 --> 00:17:28.928
It's unthinkable that Nana would've written it.

316
00:17:28.928 --> 00:17:30.228
As far as I've read her mails,

317
00:17:30.228 --> 00:17:35.928
she always wrote Mr. Migita's name in katakana characters.

318
00:17:35.928 --> 00:17:39.228
So, I wonder if she, at the verge of dying

319
00:17:39.228 --> 00:17:42.328
would suddenly write his name in kanji characters.

320
00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:45.328
I see. It is unnatural.

321
00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:48.128
But even so, you can't say that I wrote it.

322
00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:51.928
No. The possibility that you did is extremely high!

323
00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:53.228
What?

324
00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:54.828
Please recall the stroke order

325
00:17:54.828 --> 00:17:59.128
of when Mr. Migita wrote the kanji character "migi"

326
00:17:59.128 --> 00:18:02.628
and the stroke order of when Mr. Samon who is a teacher,

327
00:18:02.628 --> 00:18:05.728
wrote the word.

328
00:18:05.728 --> 00:18:08.028
But I know what I did...

329
00:18:08.028 --> 00:18:10.528
Let me give you an orderly explanation.

330
00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:12.428
First of all, Mr. Samon's plan was

331
00:18:12.428 --> 00:18:14.628
to keep sending Mr. Migita obnoxious mails

332
00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:17.628
from Nana's smart phone to start with.

333
00:18:19.128 --> 00:18:20.928
Mr. Samon, who was aware of Mr. Migita's personality,

334
00:18:20.928 --> 00:18:24.128
and his distorted love for her worked it out

335
00:18:24.128 --> 00:18:28.928
so that Mr. Migita would attempt to kill her.

336
00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:31.128
How unpleasant.

337
00:18:31.128 --> 00:18:32.528
How can you say something like that?

338
00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:35.428
The writing style.

339
00:18:35.428 --> 00:18:36.928
The writing style?

340
00:18:36.928 --> 00:18:39.528
In the mail that Nana herself had written,

341
00:18:39.528 --> 00:18:42.128
there are no punctuation marks,

342
00:18:42.128 --> 00:18:46.928
and at the end of the mail, she always inserts her name "Nana."

343
00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:49.828
But in the mail that was written to get Mr. Migita angry

344
00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:51.128
there were punctuation marks,

345
00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:54.628
but no signature "Nana."

346
00:18:54.628 --> 00:18:56.528
The writing style that a person usually uses

347
00:18:56.528 --> 00:18:58.728
cannot be changed that easily.

348
00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:01.428
Just like a person's stroke order.

349
00:19:01.428 --> 00:19:04.628
It's apparent that someone else wrote it.

350
00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:08.128
And the plan actually worked out.

351
00:19:08.128 --> 00:19:09.828
As you had figured out it to be,

352
00:19:09.828 --> 00:19:11.628
Mr. Migita who was angered with the hate

353
00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:15.628
that built up inside of him, killed her.

354
00:19:15.628 --> 00:19:17.928
At the park you went to confirm the chain of events,

355
00:19:17.928 --> 00:19:20.528
when you found Nana lying on the ground,

356
00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:22.928
I'm sure that you were convinced

357
00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.828
that your scheme worked out.

358
00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:29.728
However, something you didn't expect happened.

359
00:19:29.728 --> 00:19:31.928
When Mr. Migita left the crime scene,

360
00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:35.628
she was probably still just in a temporary state of apparent death.

361
00:19:35.628 --> 00:19:38.328
Nana revived.

362
00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:41.728
Back then, Nana in order to wash the soil off her face,

363
00:19:41.728 --> 00:19:43.928
washed her face using the water from the faucet.

364
00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:45.428
The face of the corpse was wet

365
00:19:45.428 --> 00:19:48.328
and her make-up was removed because of this.

366
00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:52.128
Then, immediately afterwards, she was finished off

367
00:19:52.128 --> 00:19:54.328
by you.

368
00:19:54.328 --> 00:19:56.528
Furthermore, you used the finger of the corpse

369
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:59.428
and tried to write the word "Migita" on the ground.

370
00:20:00.328 --> 00:20:01.928
However, while you were in the process,

371
00:20:01.928 --> 00:20:04.128
you noticed us approaching

372
00:20:04.128 --> 00:20:07.028
and had no choice but to leave the scene.

373
00:20:08.528 --> 00:20:11.128
This is the truth of what happened.

374
00:20:12.228 --> 00:20:15.328
It's true that everything falls into place,

375
00:20:15.328 --> 00:20:17.728
but all you mentioned is circumstantial evidence.

376
00:20:17.728 --> 00:20:19.528
You have no concrete evidence.

377
00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:21.428
I've got concrete proof.

378
00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:22.628
Huh?

379
00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:26.428
The gunpowder residue that was found on the clothes of the corpse.

380
00:20:26.428 --> 00:20:28.328
Gunpowder residue?

381
00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:31.228
Why was gunpowder residue found at the site

382
00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:33.628
when no gun was used?

383
00:20:33.628 --> 00:20:37.528
The answer was found in the image inside your smart phone.

384
00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:39.228
Just what do you mean?

385
00:20:39.228 --> 00:20:42.328
In the image you were being congratulated

386
00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:44.328
with a lot of party crackers.

387
00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:47.028
As you can tell from what sounds to be the sound of gun fire,

388
00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:51.428
the party crackers leave gunpowder residue behind when used.

389
00:20:51.428 --> 00:20:54.828
And this gunpowder residue that was left on your clothes back then

390
00:20:54.828 --> 00:20:56.828
also ended up being on Nana's clothes

391
00:20:56.828 --> 00:21:00.028
when you strangled her to death.

392
00:21:00.028 --> 00:21:02.328
I'm sure that investigation will show

393
00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:05.528
that the same gunpowder residue that was on her clothes,

394
00:21:05.528 --> 00:21:10.428
would also be found on your clothes, too.

395
00:21:10.428 --> 00:21:12.128
Can you explain this?

396
00:21:12.128 --> 00:21:13.328
Why would the same gunpowder residue be found

397
00:21:13.328 --> 00:21:15.028
on both your clothes and Nana's

398
00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:17.928
when you didn't even see her?

399
00:21:20.128 --> 00:21:22.628
How ironic.

400
00:21:22.628 --> 00:21:24.828
To think that the children congratulating me

401
00:21:24.828 --> 00:21:27.028
would serve as proof...

402
00:21:27.028 --> 00:21:29.928
But, why did you kill Nana?

403
00:21:29.928 --> 00:21:33.728
You two looked so happy together.

404
00:21:33.728 --> 00:21:37.128
Your motive was that Nana had called off the engagement, no?

405
00:21:37.128 --> 00:21:38.728
How do you know?

406
00:21:38.728 --> 00:21:40.528
The ring.

407
00:21:40.528 --> 00:21:42.028
You're wearing an engagement

408
00:21:42.028 --> 00:21:44.028
on the middle finger of your right hand.

409
00:21:44.028 --> 00:21:47.828
But there was no ring on Nana's finger.

410
00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:49.928
That's when I realized

411
00:21:49.928 --> 00:21:53.428
that your feelings for her were just a one-sided thing.

412
00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:57.728
I couldn't take it.

413
00:21:57.728 --> 00:21:59.928
As long as Nana was alive,

414
00:21:59.928 --> 00:22:03.728
I would continue to keep feeling miserable.

415
00:22:03.728 --> 00:22:06.628
I just couldn't bear the thought.

416
00:23:33.428 --> 00:23:36.028
I hope we're really supposed to take a right here?

417
00:23:36.028 --> 00:23:38.228
I think so.

418
00:23:38.228 --> 00:23:40.128
If you say so, I'm sure we should go left.

419
00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.228
How rude!

420
00:23:41.228 --> 00:23:43.528
It's a right, go right! It's definitely a right!

421
00:23:43.528 --> 00:23:45.928
No, it's a left. Definitely a left, left it is.

422
00:23:45.928 --> 00:23:47.528
-Go right! -A left!

423
00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:49.228
Who cares which way it is.

424
00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:50.928
I just want to get home quickly.

425
00:23:52.028 --> 00:23:55.628

426

All's fine if I get to see Yoko!

440

Whatevers.
