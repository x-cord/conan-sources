1
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:05,735
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:08,685
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:11,685
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,685
Today's case is on location
for a TV drama!

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:18,475
No matter how good an actor is,
there is always only one truth!

6
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:56,152
The TV Drama Murder Case.

7
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,402
Beika Shrine

8
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,902
No...

9
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:26,042
I never meant to kill you!

10
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,932
Cut!

11
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:34,052
Okay! That's it for this scene!

12
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,762
That was some fine acting, Yoko!

13
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,232
Filming a TV drama is interesting,
don't you think?

14
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:40,982
Yeah!

15
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:42,572
Popular Idol Okino Yoko (21)

16
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,112
Thank you!
Popular Idol Okino Yoko (21)

17
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:46,782
Leading Man Nachi Shingo (23)

18
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:51,032
As if the great leading man
Nachi Shingo would ever mess up!
Leading Man Nachi Shingo (23)

19
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:54,192
Yoko-chan! You must be exhausted!

20
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,572
Thank you, Mori-san!

21
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,732
What an amazing performance that was!

22
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:02,252
I'm absolutely certain that this drama
will go down as a masterpiece!

23
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:06,342
But only because you helped
supervise the mystery writing!

24
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,402
That's right!

25
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:10,572
We have with us the
famous detective who's known

26
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:11,922
as the modern-day Akechi Kogoro!

27
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:14,892
This drama's going to be a smash hit,
no doubt about it!

28
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,652
Well, I suppose I did help a lot!

29
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,392
He's on top of the world now...

30
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:28,322
This goes here,
and this goes like this...

31
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,282
Way too easy...

32
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:31,442
Hey, you!

33
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,152
Don't be touching my things!

34
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:35,532
I'm sorry, Nachi-san!

35
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,202
I wasn't paying
close enough attention to him...

36
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:42,982
Well, I guess I can forgive him
if it's for a cute girl like you...

37
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,332
Thank you!

38
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:46,792
Bah. What a smooth talker.

39
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:51,152
You're into matchstick puzzles,
Nachi-san?

40
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:55,302
Yes, leading men like me
prefer intelligent hobbies.

41
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:59,102
Oh, is that so?

42
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,692
Continuity Checker Mamegaki Taeko (24)
Nachi-san! Good work today!

43
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:03,682
Here's a towel!
Continuity Checker Mamegaki Taeko (24)

44
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,982
Oh! Thank you!

45
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:09,322
Say, would you have dinner
with me tonight?

46
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:10,992
Sorry, I can't!

47
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:12,442
Oh, come on!

48
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,572
She can't.

49
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:17,532
She and this kid are
getting hitched next month.

50
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,782
Ain't that right, Shimazaki?

51
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:19,862
Assistant Director Shimazaki Yuji (26)

52
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:21,732
Yeah...
Assistant Director Shimazaki Yuji (26)

53
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:22,502
Assistant Director Shimazaki Yuji (26)

54
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,652
Really?! Congratulations!

55
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:27,422
Thanks!

56
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:31,132
They only seem like flowers
before you marry them.

57
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,262
You don't know it's an illusion
until it's too late.

58
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,882
What?!

59
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:37,972
No, Yuji-san!

60
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,812
He always has something bad to say!

61
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:45,732
It's just what people say.
I'm not necessarily talking about you.

62
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:48,172
Don't get so upset.

63
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,782
It's my watch's alarm.

64
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:57,532
Cool sound, huh? I bought it
last month when I went to America.

65
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,122
Guess you don't care.

66
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,542
See you chumps later.

67
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,642
What a jerk...

68
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:11,032
One, two, three...

69
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:13,362
Are they finished filming?

70
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,672
Yes, Grandfather.

71
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,762
Make sure to clean everything up
before you leave.

72
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,392
Especially things like that.

73
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:23,902
We will, Grandfather!

74
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:25,192
I leave it in your hands.

75
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:30,192
Your grandfather is
the shrine keeper here?!

76
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,402
Yes, this shrine is where I grew up.

77
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,362
Hey, Ran-neechan...

78
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:38,862
Didn't your friend ask you
to get Nachi Shingo's autograph?

79
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:40,612
I forgot!

80
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:41,642
Where is he?!

81
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,402
Already went to change clothes.

82
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:44,332
Oh no!

83
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,282
Wait a sec, Ran-neechan!

84
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:49,252
Cut the crap!

85
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,362
That's Nachi-san's voice...

86
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:53,112
Do you even have any proof?!

87
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:54,552
Of course I do.

88
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:59,232
If you want these photos and negatives,
you know what to do.

89
00:05:59,232 --> 00:05:59,882
Money?!

90
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,392
What's the matter?

91
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,642
No, nothing at all!

92
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:15,822
Mori-san. We'll be staying
at this inn tonight.

93
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,612
How about a nice bath and a drink?

94
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,902
Sounds good to me!

95
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,362
Give me a break, Dad...

96
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:25,232
Ran-san and Conan-kun should come too!

97
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,032
Sure!

98
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:28,402
What a crappy-looking inn!

99
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:31,872
A leading man such as me would
never stay in a place like this!

100
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:35,212
This constant talk about being
a leading man is really annoying...

101
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:38,882
I'll be staying at the Teitan Hotel.

102
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,632
Wait, Nachi-san!

103
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,882
He's hopeless...

104
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:50,562
Drink up, Mori-san!

105
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:53,272
Sorry for the wait!

106
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:55,152
Hey, Anzai! Where you goin'?

107
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:57,982
The camera doesn't
keep itself tuned up, you know.

108
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:00,442
What an unfriendly fellow.

109
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:05,032
Yuji-san. I need to take care
of something at home...

110
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:07,792
Okay. Hurry back.

111
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,542
You don't need make-up, Ran-san!
You're still young!

112
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,192
That's Shimazaki-san!

113
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:24,192
Hey, Shimazaki! Get me some
cigarettes while you're out.

114
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,412
Sure thing!

115
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:30,362
Say, Ran-san! Let's go
to the convenience store!

116
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:33,942
But isn't it a bad idea for
an idol to walk outside at night?

117
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,862
I'll be fine!

118
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:39,902
Nobody'll recognize me if I change
my hairstyle and wear a hat!

119
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,612
I saw them changing!

120
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,612
Yoko-san. Are you really
sure this is okay?

121
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,262
Of course!

122
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,622
It looks like Anzai-san's
going out too...

123
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:59,732
You worry too much, Ran-san!

124
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,152
Huh?

125
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,012
Taeko-san...

126
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,802
Taeko-san?

127
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,072
Taeko-san!

128
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:08,572
Oh, Ran-san!

129
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,352
Is something the matter?

130
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,182
No...

131
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,562
I wonder what that was about...

132
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,132
She looked like she had seen a ghost...

133
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:23,132
Thank you!

134
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,322
See? I told you we'd be fine!

135
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,412
You were right! They didn't
recognize you at all!

136
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,282
Who was that?!

137
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,652
Don't tell me it was an offering thief!

138
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:44,922
There's someone on the ground!

139
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:49,642
Anzai-san!

140
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,312
He's dead! Call the police!

141
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:55,812
Hurry!

142
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,732
Right!

143
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:05,612
Even if the victim's hat
fell off when he collapsed,

144
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,282
how did his vest come off?!

145
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:13,502
This is the knife they
used during filming!

146
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:18,482
Which means that the killer was
someone on the filming crew!

147
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,182
Shinto Statue

148
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:32,012
This is a dying message
the victim left behind!

149
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,032
"Shinto Statue?"

150
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,192
Is this a clue to who did it?!

151
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:45,572
You saw someone suspicious before
you found the body, correct?

152
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:50,072
Yes. But it was too dark to even
tell if it was a man or a woman.

153
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:52,032
And that was around 10:30.

154
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:55,572
That means the murder
took place between 10:00

155
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:59,232
and when the victim left the inn at 10:30.

156
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:03,612
Inspector. This case is surprisingly simple.

157
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:04,822
How's that?

158
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:10,552
First off, the murder weapon was
used during the show's filming.

159
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,512
Second, "Shinto Statue" clearly
refers to the Shinto Shrine.

160
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:16,722
From these two facts alone...

161
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,432
...the killer must be you,
Mamegaki Taeko-san!

162
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:22,312
Nonsense! Taeko would never kill anyone!

163
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:27,282
Taeko-san. You were gone for nearly
an hour during the party, correct?

164
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:30,732
I needed to get something at home...

165
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,692
Our house is behind the shrine.

166
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,232
Can anyone verify that you were there?

167
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:38,542
Grandfather was out at the time,
so I was the only one there...

168
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:44,172
But Taeko-san came back just
as Anzai-san left the inn!

169
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,232
What?!

170
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:49,882
After she came back, she stayed
in the hall the whole time...

171
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,342
That means she couldn't
possibly have killed him.

172
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:55,682
Get a hold of yourself, will ya?!

173
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,732
Any fingerprints on the murder weapon?!

174
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,062
No. But it looks like
someone wiped them away.

175
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,652
That's weird!

176
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,692
If the killer had time to wipe
the fingerprints off,

177
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,772
why not run off with
the murder weapon instead?!

178
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:12,752
Did anyone among you leave the inn
between 10:00 and 10:30?

179
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,662
Um... I went to buy cigarettes.

180
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:19,942
When was this?

181
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:20,732
Let me think...

182
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,292
9:45!

183
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:25,692
I happened to look
at my watch just then!

184
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,252
And when did you return?

185
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,612
About 30 minutes later.

186
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:32,062
Which would be 10:15?

187
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:32,722
Yes.

188
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:34,942
Tell me, Nachi-san.

189
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:37,572
I hear you were the only one who
decided to stay at the Teitan Hotel

190
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,682
instead of this inn.

191
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:44,652
My pride as a leading man wouldn't
let me stay in such a hovel!

192
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:48,612
Where were you between
10:00 and 10:30?

193
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,322
I was in the hotel bar until 10:00.

194
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,012
Plenty of people can vouch for me.

195
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,112
I'm asking about after that!

196
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:57,152
I was in my hotel room.

197
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:58,572
Can anyone verify this?

198
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,742
I was by myself, so no!

199
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:04,672
The killer's someone
on the filming crew...

200
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:09,092
Our only clue is the phrase "Shinto Statue,"
which the victim wrote...

201
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:12,462
Taeko-san is the one most closely
connected to Shinto statues...

202
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:17,682
But she returned to the inn
just as the victim was leaving it.

203
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,472
Come to think of it...

204
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:22,772
...why was she so surprised then?!

205
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:27,442
Shimazaki-san went to buy
cigarettes at 9:45

206
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:29,982
and returned to the inn at 10:15.

207
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,702
More than enough time
to commit the murder.

208
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,282
But it was 10:30 when we saw
the person at the shrine.

209
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:37,902
Shimazaki-san was back
at the inn by then.

210
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:43,252
Nachi-san has no alibi after 10:00--
he could have done it as well.

211
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:45,692
It sounded like he was being
blackmailed by the victim,

212
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:48,212
so in terms of motive,
he's the most suspicious.

213
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:52,152
And Nachi-san was most likely
the one we saw in the shadows!

214
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:56,052
Inspector! We found these
in the victim's room!

215
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:03,352
Nachi-san... This is you leaving
a hotel with a woman...

216
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,772
That's the actress Hagiyama Ritsuko!

217
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,232
But she's married!

218
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,732
Photographic evidence
of your infidelity...

219
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:14,972
Now that you mention it!

220
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:16,952
Do you know something, Ran?!

221
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:22,122
I saw Anzai-san trying to
blackmail Nachi-san earlier!

222
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:24,532
Blackmail?!

223
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,582
So you are the killer!

224
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,572
I already told you, I didn't do it!

225
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,902
If I killed him, then what the hell
does "Shinto Statue" mean?!

226
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:34,172
You sure that's not
one of your nicknames?

227
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,422
You idiot!

228
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:41,142
No leading man like me would
have a crappy nickname like that!

229
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:45,022
What exactly does this
"Shinto Statue" mean?!

230
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,072
Wait a second!

231
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:51,192
Why would he go through the
trouble of writing it down?!

232
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:53,192
He was killed right
in front of a Shinto statue--

233
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:55,572
all he had to do was point at it!

234
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,612
There was no need to write it out!

235
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:00,132
What's this?!

236
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,330
Do you even have any proof
that I was here?!

237
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,090
Huh? This writing is weird!

238
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,180
This character isn't drawn right!

239
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,050
That lousy kid's at it again!

240
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,700
How many times do I have to--

241
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,440
This man was an adult, but he
couldn't even write katakana right!

242
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,520
What did he draw wrong?

243
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,440
You're supposed to write
this part here all in one stroke.

244
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,150
But he wrote it using two.

245
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,740
What now?!

246
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,450
You're right...

247
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,200
He did the same with
the last character too!

248
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,700
What?!

249
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,380
What if these incorrect strokes were
actually lines that were added later?!

250
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,790
"Leading man"?!

251
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,090
The only leading man
around here is Nachi Shingo!

252
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,850
It looks like some definitive
proof has shown itself.

253
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,700
No! It wasn't me!

254
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,740
I'll admit that I was supposed
to meet Anzai here at 10:30,

255
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,150
but when I showed up,
he was already dead!

256
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,080
Enough of this tomfoolery!

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,330
It's the truth! He really
was dead when I got here!

258
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,700
I was about to run away, but then
I saw "leading man" written there...

259
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,450
So I added some vertical lines like
in the matchstick puzzles that I do!

260
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,870
If you're not the killer, then why
did the victim write "leading man"?

261
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,330
Hell if I know!

262
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,700
Wait a minute!

263
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,160
It's not normal for someone
to fake a dying message

264
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,380
but not come up with a fake alibi!

265
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,090
Maybe the real killer altered
the message to say "leading man"!

266
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,850
Could this be what I think it is?!

267
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,950
It couldn't have been that person!

268
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,070
What's that?!

269
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,990
There's no blood on this watch!

270
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,120
Aha! That's it!

271
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,490
Now I know the truth behind this case!

272
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,250
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

273
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,750
Listen to how pathetic you sound,
Mr. Leading Man!

274
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,700
You can give us the details
down at the station.

275
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,760
Not so fast!

276
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,770
Inspector Megure.
Nachi-san is not the murderer.

277
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,230
Come again?!

278
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,600
The reason being that the murder
took place before 10:00!

279
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,490
That's impossible!

280
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,160
What are you talking about, Dad?

281
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,790
We saw Anzai-san leave
the inn around 10:00!

282
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,200
We even heard his watch alarm go off!

283
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,660
Inspector. Have a look
at the victim's wristwatch.

284
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,160
His watch?

285
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,000
His entire left arm is covered in blood,

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,540
but there's none at all on his watch.

287
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,000
You're right!

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,790
In other words, someone removed
the watch from the body

289
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,470
after the victim was killed!

290
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,930
Someone removed his watch?

291
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,990
This particular person wanted to
make it look like the murder happened

292
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,910
later than it actually did.

293
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,870
So the killer came up with the idea
of taking the watch back to the inn

294
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,370
and setting the alarm off
in the victim's room.

295
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,780
But it would cause problems if blood
dripped off it on the way back,

296
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,200
so the killer wiped the watch clean.

297
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,160
That means the person
we saw at the inn was--

298
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,200
That's right. That wasn't Anzai-san.

299
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,710
The person who set the alarm
off in Anzai-san's room

300
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,340
put his vest and hat on and left
the inn disguised as Anzai-san himself.

301
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,340
This person rushed back to the shrine,

302
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,970
put the watch back on the dead body,

303
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,060
and then dropped the hat and vest nearby!

304
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,770
Then the killer wrote "leading man"
to make Nachi-san look guilty!

305
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,240
If the killer wanted
Nachi-san to look guilty,

306
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,370
why not just write "Nachi"?!

307
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,230
That would have been a much
more effective way of fooling us!

308
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,490
The killer couldn't write "Nachi."

309
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,120
The reason being that the victim
had already written something

310
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,620
that identified the murderer.

311
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,080
Something that identified the murderer?

312
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,240
That's right.

313
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,080
"Leading man" was actually a
single word that the victim wrote,

314
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,920
with extra strokes added in later.

315
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,540
Then what was the
original word the victim wrote?!

316
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,090
It was "Mame."

317
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,470
Mamegaki Taeko-san.
You're the murderer.

318
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,180
Nonsense! She would never!

319
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,790
It couldn't be!

320
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,290
But Mori-san!

321
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,360
Taeko-san returned to the inn just as
the person disguised as Anzai-san left!

322
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,450
It was me! I killed Anzai-san!

323
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,240
I was the one who dressed up as him!

324
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,570
But the word "Mame"
wasn't written there!

325
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,870
Shimazaki-san. You were indeed
the one who dressed up as him,

326
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,540
but you cannot possibly be the killer.

327
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,740
See the huge spray of blood
around the body?

328
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,750
The killer must have been covered
in a lot of blood as well.

329
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,960
But there's not even a single
drop on your clothes.

330
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,160
The only person who had time
to change clothes and wash off the blood

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,010
was Taeko-san!

332
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,160
No! I killed him!

333
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,580
Yuji-san. It's over.

334
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,350
Taeko!

335
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,330
It's just as you said, Mori-san.

336
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,440
I killed Anzai-san.

337
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,820
Taeko-san!

338
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,650
No way!

339
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,450
I take it you didn't know Shimazaki-san
had dressed up as him?

340
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,580
No.

341
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,240
So I was really shocked when
I saw Anzai-san at the front door...

342
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,170
I had no idea what was going on anymore.

343
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,330
But why, Taeko-san?!

344
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,130
Taeko-san. Anzai was blackmailing
you too, wasn't he?

345
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,120
Yes.

346
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,790
When I was in high school,
I turned rebellious for a short time

347
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,660
after my parents died in an accident.

348
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,540
I stopped going to school and started
hanging out with the wrong crowd...

349
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,700
Anzai was one of them.

350
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,540
Grandfather.

351
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,710
Remember when everyone
was in an uproar

352
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,240
after that expensive statue was stolen
from the shrine storehouse?

353
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,620
Yes...

354
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,870
That was my fault.

355
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,080
After I mentioned it to Anzai,
he immediately went and stole it...

356
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,910
What?!

357
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,790
Why didn't you tell me?!

358
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,870
I tried to!

359
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,540
But Sugiyama-san, who was
in charge of the storehouse,

360
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,330
felt responsible for it
and killed himself!

361
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,140
I was too scared to say anything
after seeing that!

362
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,240
After that, I quit hanging
around Anzai and the others,

363
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,870
and I started taking school
seriously again.

364
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,150
I had nearly managed to suppress
the memories of that detestable event!

365
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,290
All I wanted was to marry Yuji-san
and start a happy family!

366
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,370
But then he showed up!

367
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,080
And then he tried to blackmail you.

368
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,330
Yes.

369
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,950
He said that since
I had been an accomplice,

370
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,370
I was just as responsible
for Sugiyama-san's suicide!

371
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,340
He told me over and over!

372
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,340
I felt that if something wasn't done,
he would ruin our marriage!

373
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,540
I was supposed to pay Anzai
some money here at 9:30 tonight.

374
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,350
But instead, I brought a knife
and threatened Anzai back!

375
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,290
I told him never to show
his face around me ever again!

376
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,110
He got mad and rushed for me...

377
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,400
...and then the knife
just happened to--

378
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,200
I never meant to kill him!

379
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,490
You seemed strange when you left,
so I pretended to go buy cigarettes.

380
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,160
When I got to the shrine,
Anzai was dead,

381
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,160
and the word "Mame" was
written in blood next to him.

382
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,790
I figured you were
the one who killed him,

383
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,330
so I tried my hardest
to alter all the evidence!

384
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,700
I wiped the fingerprints off the knife,

385
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,870
and took Anzai's watch back to the inn!

386
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,330
The rest is exactly as Mori-san deduced.

387
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,330
I should've just gotten rid
of that writing in blood!

388
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,860
But then I remembered how he threatened
Nachi-san earlier this evening,

389
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,870
so I made "Mame" say
"leading man" instead!

390
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,040
I'm so sorry, Yuji-san! Forgive me!

391
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,000
Taeko!

392
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,290
This door was locked!

393
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,490
He may have killed himself!

394
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,950
Nope. This was a murder!

395
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,120
You're in the way again?!

396
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,370
Look closely at the doorway!

397
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,420
The murderer is among the seven of you!

398
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,580
On the next Conan--

399
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,970
The Luxury Liner Murders, Part 1.

400
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:00,330
Next Conan's Hint:

401
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:00,332
Next Conan's Hint:
A piece of bread.

402
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,189
A piece of bread.
