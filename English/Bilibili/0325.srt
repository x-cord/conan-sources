1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,140
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,740
This is an eerie 3-part story.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,540
The map of the fires are trying to tell us something.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:45,667
"Red Horse In The Fire (Case)"

9
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:50,167
So, that was when I told that lady to back off.

10
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,467
I told her to give in,

11
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:56,667
that she had no chance of winning this game.

12
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:00,867
But it's all thanks to Pops.

13
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,567
Because he solved the hidden message that Heiji had put in the code

14
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:06,167
and saved us.

15
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,367
What?

16
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:13,667
-We... -Well, let bygones be bygones!

17
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,167
Pops, your glass is empty.

18
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,867
Here, have another shot.

19
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,067
You're the one who brought the subject up.

20
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,767
But that lady was really the pits.

21
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,567
She tried to burn us to death.

22
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,267
Burn you to death?

23
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,967
She was going to set fire to her own house

24
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,767
and tell the court that somebody who held a grudge on her

25
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,067
set fire to her house,

26
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,967
didn't make it out of the house in time and burned to death.

27
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,667
Well, that sure was dangerous.

28
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,067
If worse came to worse, it could've been blamed on

29
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,267
the arsonist that's been causing panic in this area.

30
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,867
An arsonist?

31
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,267
From the start of this year,

32
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:53,067
there have been a series of arson cases.

33
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:56,467
A series, which means that the method of arson is the same?

34
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,067
No. There's no similarity in the method of arson,

35
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:03,667
but there's always this one thing left at the site of the fire.

36
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,967
A doll of a red horse.

37
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,367
A red horse?

38
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,867
I see.

39
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:15,567
The arsonist is hinting on the code word of the police "Red horse".

40
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,767
What?

41
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,167
The arsonist is probably making fun of the police

42
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,567
and provoking the police,

43
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:25,867
"I'm the arsonist. Catch me if you can."

44
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,567
Well, but it's fortunate that

45
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:32,367
nobody died in the three arsons committed so far.

46
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:37,667
And? Are the three cases connected in any way?

47
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:41,667
Well, it seems that these three cases are not connected at all.

48
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,467
The addresses are scattered, too.

49
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:46,967
The first one was at Rizencho 1-chome,

50
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:50,267
the second at Toriyacho 2-chome

51
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:53,067
and the third at Okuhocho 3-chome.

52
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,667
Which means the next arson will be in the 4-chome area somewhere.

53
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,067
Yeah.

54
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:03,567
If the arsonist is setting fire at random, it's possible,

55
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:07,667
so the police is keeping an eye on the 4-chome area within town.

56
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,967
But there are so many 4-chomes all over the place.

57
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:14,467
But I know of a house that may be a target.

58
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,067
What?

59
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,067
I was asked by Mr. Kusukawa a while ago

60
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,167
to go over to a person's house

61
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,067
to take over investigation of a suspicious person

62
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,667
that was seen late at night loitering around a house

63
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,267
near Haidocho 4-chome.

64
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,867
Well, I don't really have anywhere to go this holiday,

65
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:34,467
so I'll take Pops and this kid go to that person's house tomorrow.

66
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,467
Okay, kid?

67
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,867
You can take dad, but not Conan.

68
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:39,967
What?

69
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,067
Excursion?

70
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:47,067
We may be able to get a clue to the serial arsonist

71
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,667
and you're going to go hand in hand on an excursion, you brat?

72
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,567
What's the big deal? He's only a kid.

73
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:57,167
But I wonder if the weather's going to be okay. It's still raining.

74
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,967
It'll be fine, because of this!

75
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,767
This sunny boy doll always cleared the weather

76
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,467
for Shinichi's important soccer matches.

77
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,967
Ran, you make me so jealous!

78
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,267
Well, it's hard going to root for him in the rain besides.

79
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:16,167
That's why it's most likely going to be a fine day tomorrow, Conan.

80
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,567
Yes.

81
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,267
"Mouri Detective Agency"

82
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,767
Strange.

83
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:52,067
The odds of the rain clearing used to be 100%.

84
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:55,167
Maybe you didn't wish hard enough, Ran.

85
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,667
Because it's not for Shinichi.

86
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,767
Don't be ridiculous! That's not true!

87
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,867
Huh? Strange.

88
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,267
When we hung it out last night,

89
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,167
it was facing out towards the window.

90
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,167
Well, it can't be helped.

91
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:14,167
The weather depends on the mood of the sun.

92
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,067
Don't tell me that he...

93
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:21,767
Your sunny boy doll's starting to take effect now?

94
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,167
Well, too bad.

95
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,767
The heavens are going to punish you one of these days.

96
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:31,567
We'll do some more shopping and go home.

97
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,867
Heiji and Pops, work hard at your detective job!

98
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,067
Yeah.

99
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,567
Let's go, Conan.

100
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,467
Those two really get along well, don't they?

101
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,767
Kazuha, don't tell me that you're jealous of Conan?

102
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,667
That's not it!

103
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,567
And? What time and where in 4-chome?

104
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,467
What? Let's see.

105
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,967
Haidocho 4-chome at the Moromizu residence at 16:00.

106
00:06:56,367 --> 00:07:01,267
Don't worry, because Pop's agency is not on 4-chome.

107
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,967
I see.

108
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,667
"Morozumi" -There! Here it is!

109
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,967
But we're 30 minutes late for the appointment.

110
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,067
What should we do?

111
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,667
It's only 30 minutes.

112
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,167
Mr. Kusukawa told me not to be late

113
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,367
because this person's really fussy about time.

114
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:21,267
Hello.

115
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,867
I don't need any!

116
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,667
Please leave!

117
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,267
I'm going to call the police if you don't!

118
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:36,167
So like I told you, I'm not here to sell anything to you.

119
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,367
"Takanori Genda (42)" -I just brought some catalogs of

120
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:42,467
the hanging scrolls and vases that we sell in our store.

121
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,267
I've been telling you for a while now.

122
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:47,667
I'm not interested in dusty junk like that!

123
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,567
Then I'll leave our catalog and a key holder

124
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,767
that will bring about good business,

125
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:55,667
so please stop by at our shop when you feel like it.

126
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,767
No need to worry. I'm not so hard up for money

127
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,967
that I have to rely on something like that!

128
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,467
Go on! And leave right this minute!

129
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,867
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

130
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,167
And? Now, what's with all of you?

131
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:21,167
Well, we're detectives here in place of Mr. Kusukawa.

132
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,367
Never mind that case already.

133
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,867
It seems to have been my imagination.

134
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,367
What?

135
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,767
Hey. What's the story?

136
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,367
It can't be helped

137
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,667
because Mr. Kusukawa was confined from 3 days ago.

138
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,967
But, isn't it strange to say that it was just her imagination

139
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,067
when she was troubled enough to hire a detective?

140
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,867
Yeah. I swear there's something fishy about that lady.

141
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:00,667
Hello.

142
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,967
You're early today, Sensei.

143
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:06,667
See! I did just as you told me.

144
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,267
"Misao Soga (45)" -From Feng Shui's point of view,

145
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:10,967
it is very good to decorate ceramic ware,

146
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,367
which is said to be great for any direction,

147
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,767
at the front door of the house that is the entrance of good luck.

148
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,467
Well, let's talk inside.

149
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,167
He's just a teacher of Feng Shui.

150
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,667
May I help you?

151
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,467
Nothing really.

152
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,867
Talk about a lot of make-up.

153
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,567
Hey, what's with you?

154
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,867
I thought I told you not to come here anymore, Keiko!

155
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,067
Don't get angry at me, Ryoko.

156
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,267
I've been unlucky this month.

157
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,267
So, I wonder if you can spare 100,000 yen...

158
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,867
No, 50,000 yen will do.

159
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,467
If you're unlucky, why don't you do something about it

160
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:46,967
with your own fortune-telling?

161
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,367
She's a fortune-teller.

162
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:02,167
Gosh. Two hours have passed already.

163
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,667
Waiting in a place like this is going to get us nowhere.

164
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,767
But the man that just went in hasn't come out yet.

165
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,167
I'll go check inside.

166
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,167
Hey!

167
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,567
Hey, you!

168
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,167
He seems to be looking for something.

169
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,367
Yeah.

170
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,667
Too bad.

171
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,667
It's not there, no matter how hard you look.

172
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:48,167
It's a video tape that is proof of our relationship,

173
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,767
so of course I hid it someplace very special in this house.

174
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,267
I'm keeping it as a guarantee that you will divorce your wife

175
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,567
and marry me instead, Sensei.

176
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,767
My husband will be coming home soon.

177
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:05,267
You're going drinking with your college friends, aren't you?

178
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:08,167
You may relax on the sofa till then.

179
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:21,167
Really, I don't understand adults, honestly.

180
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,767
It's scary because even your relationship with your wife

181
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:26,067
who you've been living separately from all these years seem to look better.

182
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,367
Be quite.

183
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,367
Hey.

184
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,867
Isn't that guy from before?

185
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,167
Who?

186
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,367
I wonder what he's doing.

187
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,567
He's probably working overtime because he can't fill his quota.

188
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,667
It seems her husband's finally come home.

189
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,267
I'm home.

190
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,667
Oh, my. Hello, dear.

191
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,767
Hello, Morosumi.

192
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,767
-Soga, you're here already. -Yeah.

193
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,767
"Akira Morosumi (45), Psychiatrist" -Let me use the bathroom.

194
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,167
Can you get the engine running while you're waiting?

195
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:09,567
No. If you're going out drinking, walk.

196
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,267
Okay.

197
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,767
And would you like to come along too, for a change?

198
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,567
No thank you, because I can't drink.

199
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,667
I also want to watch the soccer game that will be aired at midnight,

200
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,867
so I'd like to take a short nap, too.

201
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,467
Really? Too bad.

202
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,267
The conversation that the two men would have over drinks

203
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,767
drew some interest, but...

204
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,467
How long do you intend to stay fooling around out there?

205
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:35,767
Hurry up and come on home!

206
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:40,967
We got a call from Ran, so we decided to head on home.

207
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,067
But...

208
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,467
Hey, Heiji! Just what do you think you're doing?

209
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,767
I went out of my way to make dinner for you,

210
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,767
and it's all cold already!

211
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,567
Where are you now?

212
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,267
The Morosumi residence where I accepted the work of the detective.

213
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,567
What?

214
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,667
You just said you're headed home because you finished the job!

215
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,467
Yeah, that's what we were planning to do,

216
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,567
but we passed a fire engine on the way back.

217
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,467
We got concerned and headed back to the residence

218
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,767
and found it blazing outrageously.

219
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:10,767
What?

220
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,367
The Morosumi residence...

221
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:24,389
Hey, this way! Hurry!

222
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,689
Ryoko...

223
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,289
Ryoko...

224
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:38,189
It seems like that woman didn't escape in time.

225
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:41,289
Gosh. If we just kept watching,

226
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,589
this wouldn't have happened.

227
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,589
But isn't it strange?

228
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,689
Those two went out to drink, right?

229
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,589
Not even an hour has past yet,

230
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:52,989
and I wonder why they came back?

231
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:54,589
True.

232
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,289
Maybe they had a premonition of some kind?

233
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,789
See, mommy? It came after all, didn't it?

234
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,089
A red horse that causes fire.

235
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,789
What?

236
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:08,689
Hey, kid. How come you knew that a red horse was coming?

237
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:10,389
Because I saw it.

238
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,289
When and where?

239
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,889
Hey, who are you people?

240
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,789
You really saw it?

241
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,989
I'm not lying! It was only the shadow of the horse, but...

242
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,789
-Shadow? -Yes.

243
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:26,189
It was when I was watching Kamen Yaiba in the living room.

244
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:29,089
When Yaiba's first song started,

245
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:31,189
it suddenly got bright outside,

246
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:34,089
so I looked outside and was surprised.

247
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,489
A shadow of a horse about this big was on the curtain!

248
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:40,789
Which way is your house?

249
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:44,389
On the right of the burning house? Or, on the left?

250
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,789
To the right.

251
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,989
Hey!

252
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,889
A horse!

253
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,189
By the window, there's a red horse!

254
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:06,189
Which means that the room that boy was watching TV in, is this room.

255
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,889
Yeah. The shadow of the horse showed up on this curtain.

256
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,789
Kaimen Yaiba starts at 7:30 pm.

257
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,489
If it got bright during the opening of the program

258
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,889
and the shadow was reflected...

259
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,989
The arsonist set fire and put the horse in place a little

260
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,789
after 7:30 pm.

261
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:28,389
Yeah. At least we know that the arsonist

262
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,989
was near this window about that time.

263
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:37,089
So, the horse set the fire after all, right, mommy?

264
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,189
Two hours later,

265
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,389
the fire that took the life of Ryoko Morosumi

266
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:47,889
was finally extinguished.

267
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,189
Will you let me in just for a minute?

268
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:54,689
No way.

269
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:58,289
Then, will you at least tell me where the fire first broke out?

270
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,489
No way.

271
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,689
What's the big deal giving out a little info?

272
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:05,789
I can't do what I can't do, even if it's for you, Mr. Mouri.

273
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,389
Hey, hey. The scene of a fire

274
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:10,589
is not territory for the homicide division, is it?

275
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,489
Old man fire of the 1st division?

276
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,789
Hey, Mouri!

277
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:18,289
How dare you call your former superior old man fire!

278
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,189
Former superior?

279
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,689
Inspector Yuminaga of the Metropolitan Police

280
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,789
Arson Investigation Division section 1.

281
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:28,689
I thought you belonged to the homicide division?

282
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:32,689
I used to be in the arson division for a little while.

283
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,789
You sure caused me a lot of agony.

284
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,889
Every time there's a fire, you claim that it's arson

285
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,589
and go out to the scene of the fire,

286
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,289
and step all over the personal effects left there.

287
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,389
God knows how many complaints I got of you from the fire department.

288
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,789
Right?

289
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,289
The same goes for you, too.

290
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:53,089
This fire is undoubtedly arson.

291
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,989
The red horse was found at the site of this fire, too.

292
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,489
We checked it out with the forensic officers

293
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,089
and found that it was a perfect match with the other three horses.

294
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,989
But Mr. Yuminaga, isn't there a possibility

295
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:07,989
that somebody who saw the incident in the newspaper or something

296
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,889
tried copying?

297
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:11,389
You idiot!

298
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,089
How can you make the exact same horse

299
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,089
by just seeing it in the papers?

300
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,789
That plastic horse is made of the same mold,

301
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,889
and is not sold anywhere,

302
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:26,289
so the arsonist probably took fun in making it himself.

303
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:29,389
The arsonist was probably having fun challenging the police,

304
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,789
but somebody has been killed this time.

305
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,389
So, the fun's over.

306
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,489
And where did the fire start?

307
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,289
Who's this boy here? Your assistant?

308
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,689
Yes, well, sort of.

309
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:47,489
The fire started in the hut beyond the right side of the house.

310
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:51,189
The storeroom with the window where the red horse was placed.

311
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:54,189
There were traces of kerosene poured on the floor.

312
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,089
So, the arsonist probably poured the kerosene in

313
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,989
from the open window and set fire.

314
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:04,589
There were a lot of strange footprints by the window of the room

315
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,889
in the foreground of the storeroom.

316
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,889
If we check the footprints carefully,

317
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,289
I'm sure we'll at least get to grab the tail of the arsonist.

318
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,089
Well, the thing is...

319
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,989
What?

320
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:22,389
Your footprints are mixed up in the footprints there?

321
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,889
I'm actually here

322
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,889
because I was asked to come here by Mrs. Ryoko Morosumi,

323
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:30,989
the victim who died of the fire.

324
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:33,489
She asked me to come check on a suspicious person

325
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,589
who was doing something around her house late at night.

326
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,389
But the lady said that it was just her imagination

327
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:40,889
and told us to leave,

328
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,389
so we were watching her for a while.

329
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:48,489
Then a strange character who seemed to be a Feng Shui Sensei came by,

330
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,589
so having no other choice, we went into her yard

331
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,489
and looked inside through the window

332
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:54,589
and saw a pretty bad scene.

333
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:56,389
Pretty bad scene?

334
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:59,989
It seems that this man was having an extra-marital affair with Ryoko,

335
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,389
and was ransacking the rooms looking for the video

336
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:04,889
that was evidence of their affair!

337
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:10,289
That act of yours sounds more than pretty bad to me.

338
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:14,689
Well, but I guess I'll have to take molds of your shoes later.

339
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:17,089
Don't tell me you think that we're suspects?

340
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,289
You idiot!

341
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,589
It's to discriminate your footprints with the arsonist's!

342
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,689
I see.

343
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,889
And? Is that man that had an affair with her,

344
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:29,289
the only one that came by the house?

345
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,789
No, four people came in all.

346
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,389
That man who had the affair and Ryoko's husband.

347
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,389
Ryoko's older sister who seems to be a fortune-teller.

348
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:43,289
A timid guy who came and left a catalog of his store with her.

349
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:49,389
But the Sensei of Feng Shui and Ryoko's husband are not arsonists.

350
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,389
According to the testimony of the kid next door,

351
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:56,589
the red horse was placed by the window at exactly 7:30 pm.

352
00:19:56,589 --> 00:20:00,689
The Sensei and her husband went out to drink at about 7:20 pm.

353
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:02,289
So, the two couldn't have done it.

354
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,489
And we were contemplating for about 5 minutes

355
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:08,089
whether to follow the two or not.

356
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,589
But at that time, there was no smoke nor fire at all.

357
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,489
The only concern is why those two came back so early

358
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,989
despite having gone drinking.

359
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:20,389
That's because a neighbor called the husband's cell phone

360
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:23,389
and told him there was a fire.

361
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:29,689
Which leaves the older sister who is a fortune-teller and the timid man.

362
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,089
Talking of fortunetelling,

363
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,689
there's a floor in the building of Haido Station

364
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,989
where fortune-tellers gather.

365
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:39,489
Then, the lady may be there.

366
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,989
-Let's go! -What? Yeah.

367
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:46,089
What? Ryoko died?

368
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,689
Are you serious?

369
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:50,089
Yes.

370
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,189
What a stupid child.

371
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:55,789
I warned her time and again to be careful

372
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,389
because I saw signs of disaster by fire in her!

373
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,289
Our father's funeral is not finished yet,

374
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,389
still why is everybody crossing over like this?

375
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,689
If you will excuse me asking,

376
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:11,089
where were you at around 7:30 pm?

377
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,389
I was here!

378
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,089
Right?

379
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:18,189
Yes. We are all under contract

380
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:21,589
to start fortune-telling from 7:30 pm.

381
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:24,289
I'm so sorry.

382
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:35,089
The only one left is the timid man.

383
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:39,389
Do you remember any characteristics of that man?

384
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:42,089
Well, his height was about 160 centimeters,

385
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:45,489
and he was wearing round glasses. He seemed to be in his forties.

386
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:49,189
I think he's an antique shop owner or something.

387
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:51,689
Since he was going around passing out catalogs,

388
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,289
I think his shop is somewhere nearby.

389
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:59,689
Mr. Yuminaga, does it ring a bell?

390
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,889
No.

391
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,489
It can't be.

392
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,589
He couldn't have.

393
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,189
"Next Episode" -The four red horses

394
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:48,489
that were found at the serial arson sites.

395
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:50,089
I wonder why only the horse left at the first site

396
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:52,489
is burnt black like this?

397
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:54,089
Rabbit?

398
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:55,589
Don't tell me that...

399
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:57,789
Hey. Isn't this Guan Yu?

400
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,189
But, what a flashy colored horse he's riding.

401
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,389
Well, this is the Red Rabbit Horse.

402
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:07,289
It's a super horse said to be able to run a thousand miles in a day.

403
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:13,389
