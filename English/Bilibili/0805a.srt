1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.325
Okay.

2
00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:02.925
At the start of the new year,

3
00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:06.425
I got caught up in an unexpected case.

4
00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:11.325
It all started when I saved a car that went out of control.

5
00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:12.725
The owner of the car,

6
00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:15.125
"Takuya Hosoo (47), HO Tradings President" -Takuya Hosoo, was a wealthy man

7
00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:16.825
who ran a trading company.

8
00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:17.825
He was on his way to deliver

9
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:20.425
a culturally significant two-faced mask that he owned

10
00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.525
to a certain individual.

11
00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:25.225
The person he was delivering the mask to

12
00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.325
was the currently most popular Kabuki actor,

13
00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:30.125
"Ebizo Ichikawa XI" -Mr. Ebizo Ichikawa.

14
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.725
Ebizo who was friends with Mr. Hosoo,

15
00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:37.125
had decided and was supposed to use that mask in his February performance.

16
00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:41.425
However, the two-faced mask that was entrusted to President Yabusaki

17
00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:44.725
was stolen by someone.

18
00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:48.825
Moreover, Mr. Hosoo's secretary, Mr. Hitoshi Takahashi,

19
00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:51.825
"Hitoshi Takahashi (40), Hosoo's secretary" -was found dead in his car.

20
00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.425
Beside him, the case that had the two-faced mask inside it

21
00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:57.525
was found empty.

22
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.225
There are several suspects.

23
00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:03.625
"Shinnosuke Iwami (29), Playwright" -Mr. Shinnosuke Iwami, the playwright,

24
00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.625
"Eiji Kaneko (37), Cameraman" -Mr. Eiji Kaneko, the cameraman,

25
00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:09.525
"Yoshiyuki Yabusaki (57), President" -Mr. Yoshiyuki Yabusaki, the president

26
00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.125
and Ms. Yukari Shioji, an accountant

27
00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.625
"Yukari Shioji (32), Accounting secretary" -working at Mr. Hosoo's company.

28
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.625
I naturally started my search for the perp.

29
00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.125
But was attacked by someone in an alley in Ginza.

30
00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:30.525
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

31
00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:32.725
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

32
00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.725
The whereabouts of the mask and Conan.

33
00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:36.925
A graceful finale on the Kabuki stage!

34
00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:38.425
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:40.325
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.325
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:28.447
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 2)"

38
00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:44.747
Where is this?

39
00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:51.047
I'm fine.

40
00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:52.747
There's nothing wrong with me.

41
00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:57.847
A basement somewhere.

42
00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:03.247
That's a boiler?

43
00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:07.247
If it's that big, this must be the B2 or B3 floor.

44
00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:22.547
This is...

45
00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:24.747
a building that's being demolished!

46
00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:28.147
My cell phone is gone.

47
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:34.947
No good.

48
00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.247
Darn.

49
00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:47.047
What? The can opener?

50
00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:48.647
You were saying something about snacks to go with your beer

51
00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:51.547
and ate the canned salmon, right?

52
00:04:51.547 --> 00:04:53.547
Canned salmon?

53
00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:55.247
I ate it.

54
00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:56.847
Hold it, there!

55
00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:59.347
I didn't use the can opener!

56
00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:01.647
All the cans are pull tops now, right? Pull tops!

57
00:05:01.647 --> 00:05:03.247
What're you going to open?

58
00:05:03.247 --> 00:05:06.047
What... A tuna can.

59
00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:10.147
A tuna can. Those cans are all pull tops, aren't they?

60
00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:13.247
You mean they have tuna cans that aren't pull tops?

61
00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:16.947
But these cans were three for 58 yen.

62
00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:19.947
What? 58 yen?

63
00:05:19.947 --> 00:05:22.247
Are you sure it's really tuna?

64
00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:23.347
Forget it!

65
00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:26.247
I'm sure you'll get a stomachache if you eat something like that!

66
00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:28.947
Thank you so much for waiting.

67
00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:30.947
Right! Now I remember!

68
00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:32.547
That glasses kid!

69
00:05:33.647 --> 00:05:34.947
Canned peaches?

70
00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:37.247
That brat. I told him to give me a piece

71
00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:39.847
and he had the nerve to say no.

72
00:05:39.847 --> 00:05:42.247
Okay. I'll ask him then.

73
00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:47.147
Really tough, isn't it? Such a long meeting.

74
00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:49.247
Four hours.

75
00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:53.247
With the other side being foreign, I sure need a lot of time.

76
00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:55.747
Just going through all the papers and with so many of pages,

77
00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:57.647
it's really time consuming.

78
00:05:57.647 --> 00:06:00.247
Besides, they're all written in English.

79
00:06:01.447 --> 00:06:03.847
Could I have you look through these too?

80
00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:06.847
"Receipt" -Yes, of course.

81
00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:19.147
Gee.

82
00:06:29.247 --> 00:06:30.347
Okay.

83
00:06:45.247 --> 00:06:47.247
If it weren't for this body,

84
00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:49.147
I wouldn't have been able to make it out.

85
00:06:51.947 --> 00:06:53.047
It stopped.

86
00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:58.847
Okay! Let's get it done by today.

87
00:06:58.847 --> 00:07:01.847
After dinner, we'll start again at 19:00!

88
00:07:01.847 --> 00:07:04.947
Yeah! Roger!

89
00:07:11.847 --> 00:07:14.647
This is the power supply room.

90
00:07:24.247 --> 00:07:25.547
Lucky!

91
00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:33.847
While I'm still lucky. I guess I'll...

92
00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:37.347
Are you returning to the practice hall?

93
00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:43.847
Yes, because Ebizo says he wants to talk to the staff and us.

94
00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:45.847
He wants to talk to you?

95
00:07:48.847 --> 00:07:50.647
Is it okay?

96
00:07:50.647 --> 00:07:53.947
I brought you the can opener, but is it okay for us to eat with you?

97
00:07:53.947 --> 00:07:57.347
This is actually dinner for Conan, right?

98
00:07:57.347 --> 00:07:59.247
You still can't connect to his phone?

99
00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:02.547
This super delicious!

100
00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:05.247
Tuna salad and tuna spaghetti.

101
00:08:05.247 --> 00:08:07.047
All tuna.

102
00:08:07.047 --> 00:08:09.447
Today is supposed to be tuna day.

103
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:12.547
-You mean the tuna festival. -What's the tuna festival?

104
00:08:12.547 --> 00:08:14.447
Is the cell phone ringing?

105
00:08:14.447 --> 00:08:18.547
Yeah. It kind of concerns me.

106
00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:20.147
True.

107
00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:22.247
I wonder if I should call Shinichi.

108
00:08:22.247 --> 00:08:24.547
-I don't think it'll do. -What?

109
00:08:24.547 --> 00:08:27.447
If he has his GPS function on, then...

110
00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:28.847
You can tell where he is?

111
00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:30.447
Of course.

112
00:08:32.747 --> 00:08:34.747
If he went to the sushi shop in Ichikawa all by himself,

113
00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:36.347
I'll never forgive him.

114
00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:38.347
You're really stuck on that, aren't you?

115
00:08:38.347 --> 00:08:39.747
Ai, not yet?

116
00:08:39.747 --> 00:08:41.647
Haste makes waste.

117
00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:44.247
Okay, his GPS is on.

118
00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:46.647
Found him!

119
00:08:46.647 --> 00:08:48.147
-Where? -Ginza.

120
00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:49.747
A sushi shop in Ginza?

121
00:08:49.747 --> 00:08:51.647
Forget the sushi shop already.

122
00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:53.247
An alley in three-chome.

123
00:08:53.247 --> 00:08:55.347
Why is he in a place like that?

124
00:08:56.447 --> 00:08:58.447
Strange. He's not moving.

125
00:08:58.447 --> 00:09:00.047
I wonder if he dropped it.

126
00:09:00.047 --> 00:09:01.947
If so, he would at least call, right?

127
00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:04.047
-Because he's not a kid. -What?

128
00:09:04.047 --> 00:09:06.447
-Let's go! -Yes, let's go!

129
00:09:06.447 --> 00:09:08.847
Okay, let's hurry and finish eating.

130
00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:10.047
-Later! -Later!

131
00:09:10.047 --> 00:09:13.347
Oh, boy. You don't have to all come at me that way.

132
00:09:25.447 --> 00:09:27.747
I did it!

133
00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:30.747
Getting out from inside is easy.

134
00:09:30.747 --> 00:09:31.947
Huh?

135
00:09:33.347 --> 00:09:35.447
Hey! No joke!

136
00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:42.447
It's crushed from above.

137
00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:55.647
Anybody, please notice!

138
00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:02.247
Okay! Let's get started!

139
00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:10.547
Hey!

140
00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:13.147
Somebody!

141
00:10:13.147 --> 00:10:16.047
Hey!

142
00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.699
I'm sure you already know about it,

143
00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:32.599
but the two-faced mask that we borrowed from Mr. Hosoo had been stolen.

144
00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:38.499
Moreover, Mr. Takahashi, Mr. Hosoo's secretary has passed away.

145
00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:43.099
The playwright, Mr. Iwami, has also been hospitalized.

146
00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:45.699
The most unsuspicious one

147
00:10:45.699 --> 00:10:48.699
is in fact the most suspicious.

148
00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:50.699
Yes? Did you say something?

149
00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:52.599
It's nothing.

150
00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:56.899
I intended to entertain the audience

151
00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:01.499
with a new interpretation of the Kabuki Juhachiban The Seven Masks.

152
00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:05.399
But what I started has resulted as such

153
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:08.099
and it's causing me much pain.

154
00:11:08.099 --> 00:11:12.399
However, I can't let that hold me back after I've come this far!

155
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:15.799
I'll need to turn this performance into a success no matter what!

156
00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.199
I'm counting on all of you!

157
00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:20.099
Yes...

158
00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:21.599
Ebizo.

159
00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.999
Iwami?

160
00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:26.199
Are you okay being discharged from the hospital?

161
00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:28.999
Knowing that all of you are doing all you can,

162
00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:32.099
I can't be staying in the hospital.

163
00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:34.299
I won't run anymore.

164
00:11:35.599 --> 00:11:37.499
The most unsuspicious one

165
00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:39.499
is in fact the most suspicious.

166
00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.499
In this new performance,

167
00:11:41.499 --> 00:11:43.099
all the four actors besides me

168
00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:46.099
will change into modern clothes in an instant.

169
00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:47.999
It's the part where I mention that

170
00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:51.599
the karma of people hasn't changed, be it in the past or present.

171
00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:54.599
Iwami, please think up a good dialog.

172
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:55.799
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.999
Everyone, may I have your attention please?

174
00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:01.099
Inspector Megure.

175
00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:05.399
Is it really here?

176
00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.099
Definitely.

177
00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:09.899
I wonder why Conan came to a place like this.

178
00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:13.699
There are just a bunch of bars if we go through here, you know.

179
00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.999
You mean he can drink now?

180
00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:18.099
We're not allowed to drink!

181
00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:19.799
It's grown-up taste, right?

182
00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:21.799
Try ringing his cell phone.

183
00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:23.299
Okay.

184
00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:28.999
Is it ringing?

185
00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.999
Yes, it's ringing.

186
00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:33.299
I don't hear anything.

187
00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:35.999
He could have it set to vibe of manner mode.

188
00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:37.799
Quiet, everybody.

189
00:12:40.099 --> 00:12:41.899
There you are.

190
00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:44.599
Did you find the kid?

191
00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:45.899
What's this about?

192
00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:52.999
-Here? -I hear it!

193
00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:54.499
Conan!

194
00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:57.099
Found it!

195
00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.199
Why is it in a place like this?

196
00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:02.699
Maybe he was duped by a fox.

197
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.399
Please stop it, Sonoko!

198
00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.899
Let's hurry and look for him!

199
00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:09.299
Ask Inspector Megure and the others for help.

200
00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:11.099
What?

201
00:13:11.099 --> 00:13:15.099
It's obvious that he's got messed up in something.

202
00:13:15.099 --> 00:13:16.899
Everybody, take out your badge.

203
00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:19.299
Split up and keep calling Conan!

204
00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.099
-Let's go, Sonoko. -Where to?

205
00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:30.699
Okay.

206
00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:38.899
I wonder how much battery's left.

207
00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:46.299
The car nor the case,

208
00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:51.499
neither had prints other than that of Mr. Hosoo and Mr. Takahashi.

209
00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:56.599
The perp wanted to get a hold of the mask bad enough to commit murder.

210
00:13:56.599 --> 00:14:00.299
If only I had stored it more carefully...

211
00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:02.399
No, not true.

212
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:05.499
There are three thinkable patterns.

213
00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:09.899
One, Mr. Takahashi steals the two-faced mask

214
00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.699
and tried to sell it to a third party.

215
00:14:12.699 --> 00:14:14.899
However, he was killed by that person

216
00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:16.899
and the mask was stolen.

217
00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.999
If so, why did the perp have to

218
00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:24.699
make Mr. Takahashi's death look like a suicide?

219
00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:27.199
It's strange that the perp would go through

220
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.699
the trouble of doing all that was done, isn't it?

221
00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:33.399
Is this guy just trying to confuse me?

222
00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.699
Excuse me?

223
00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:38.399
Well, deductions are never perfect.

224
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.599
Pattern number two!

225
00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:43.699
The perp thought that he could make money and stole the mask.

226
00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:46.299
"Takuzo Minowa (55), Security guard" -I... I didn't steal it.

227
00:14:46.299 --> 00:14:49.999
Mr. Mouri is not referring to you, Mr. Minowa.

228
00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:54.499
The perp who thought that the mask was worth money

229
00:14:54.499 --> 00:14:58.899
contacted Mr. Takahashi asking him to buy the mask back.

230
00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:02.599
And after receiving the money, killed him!

231
00:15:02.599 --> 00:15:04.999
After all, his face has been disclosed.

232
00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:06.799
Besides, in order to put the blame on Mr. Takahashi,

233
00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:08.199
he framed the suicide.

234
00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.899
But then, why go to Mr. Takahashi? He made contact, right?

235
00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:13.399
If he wanted to make money off the mask,

236
00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:16.599
shouldn't he have gone to Mr. Hosoo to have it bought back?

237
00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:21.099
He's countering me every chance he has after all.

238
00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:23.499
Which means...

239
00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:26.299
Did such an individual try to get in touch with you?

240
00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:28.399
No, not at all.

241
00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:32.899
You may be the perp.

242
00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:35.499
So, the possibility of suicide has been totally erased?

243
00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:37.499
I would say so.

244
00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:42.599
So he's trying to switch the crime he committed over to suicide now.

245
00:15:42.599 --> 00:15:44.399
There were traces that the inside of the car

246
00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:47.799
as well as the engine room had been cleanly wiped.

247
00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:48.899
Right.

248
00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:51.499
A person contemplating to commit suicide

249
00:15:51.499 --> 00:15:54.599
wouldn't think of wiping off his prints, would he?

250
00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:56.299
True.

251
00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:58.799
True, my butt!

252
00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:00.999
He dug his own grave.

253
00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.499
Ran.

254
00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.699
Dad, big trouble!

255
00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:10.199
I'm busy right now.

256
00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:12.899
Talk to me about the can opener after I get home.

257
00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:13.899
It's not that.

258
00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:17.399
It's not the can opener. We're looking for Conan!

259
00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:19.699
What about the glasses kid?

260
00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:22.999
What? He's missing?

261
00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:25.399
Is that something unusual?

262
00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.199
Maybe he's just taking his time in the john or something?

263
00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:29.399
Excuse me!

264
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.099
Who?

265
00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:35.799
Yes. Ichikawa...

266
00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.299
You mean you're Ebizo!

267
00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.899
Okay, I'll be right over.

268
00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.299
What seems to be the matter?

269
00:16:44.299 --> 00:16:48.099
It seems that Conan went missing around the four-chome area.

270
00:16:48.099 --> 00:16:49.999
Conan?

271
00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:52.199
This is my turf,

272
00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:53.599
so I'll go look for him.

273
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.199
Now I'm sure.

274
00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:01.399
Those who commit crimes

275
00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:04.699
are most likely to act as if they're cooperating.

276
00:17:06.499 --> 00:17:08.199
Cooperate?

277
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.999
Act as if?

278
00:17:14.263 --> 00:17:17.263
"Iwai Bridge"

279
00:17:17.663 --> 00:17:20.663
Let's presume that he's been abducted.

280
00:17:20.663 --> 00:17:22.363
I'm sure this is in some way

281
00:17:22.363 --> 00:17:25.763
connected to the case of the two-faced mask being stolen.

282
00:17:25.763 --> 00:17:28.163
Will you show me the cell phone that you found?

283
00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:29.363
Yes.

284
00:17:32.763 --> 00:17:37.363
The last incoming call was at 16:05 from you Ran.

285
00:17:37.363 --> 00:17:40.063
He said that he was at Kabukiza at that time.

286
00:17:40.063 --> 00:17:42.363
So we missed each other.

287
00:17:42.363 --> 00:17:44.663
Then right after that,

288
00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:46.163
he called somebody at 16:08.

289
00:17:46.163 --> 00:17:47.863
"Call history" -Since there's no name,

290
00:17:47.863 --> 00:17:49.963
he must've entered the number manually.

291
00:17:49.963 --> 00:17:51.663
I tried calling it,

292
00:17:51.663 --> 00:17:53.463
but the phone seems to be switched off.

293
00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:55.163
You're...

294
00:17:55.163 --> 00:17:57.063
I'm Ai Haibara,

295
00:17:57.063 --> 00:18:00.363
adviser for the same detective squad that Conan is in.

296
00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:02.363
-Conan's... -Adviser?

297
00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:05.363
-That's one hell of a job. -Somebody who gives advice to the leader.

298
00:18:05.363 --> 00:18:07.963
Ai's voice kind of sounds sweeter than usual.

299
00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:10.863
I see! In my contacts?

300
00:18:10.863 --> 00:18:13.563
It's hard to tell just by looking at the number, though, right?

301
00:18:13.563 --> 00:18:16.163
I used to be able to remember all the numbers before, but now...

302
00:18:16.163 --> 00:18:19.163
I'll enter the number.

303
00:18:19.163 --> 00:18:21.263
Then, push here last.

304
00:18:21.263 --> 00:18:23.263
"Eiji Kaneko" -It's Kaneko!

305
00:18:23.263 --> 00:18:26.563
Mr. Kaneko... The cameraman?

306
00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:29.763
I got the staff together just a while ago,

307
00:18:29.763 --> 00:18:31.463
but he wasn't there.

308
00:18:34.063 --> 00:18:35.763
There!

309
00:18:40.763 --> 00:18:43.063
If I can widen this...

310
00:18:47.263 --> 00:18:48.663
I'll make it!

311
00:18:55.363 --> 00:18:56.863
Darn!

312
00:18:57.963 --> 00:19:00.163
Let's go to Kaneko's residence.

313
00:19:00.163 --> 00:19:01.963
Where is it?

314
00:19:01.963 --> 00:19:04.763
President Yabusaki should know where it is.

315
00:19:07.163 --> 00:19:08.263
Edogawa?

316
00:19:08.263 --> 00:19:09.363
Conan?

317
00:19:09.363 --> 00:19:10.363
You guys!

318
00:19:10.363 --> 00:19:12.863
You've come for me after all!

319
00:19:12.863 --> 00:19:15.163
Look for a building that's being demolished!

320
00:19:17.063 --> 00:19:18.563
There's one nearby.

321
00:19:20.863 --> 00:19:23.163
The basement of the building that's being demolished.

322
00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:27.663
Edogawa? Where are you? Which building?

323
00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:29.863
-Conan! -No good, it's been cut off.

324
00:19:29.863 --> 00:19:31.563
I heard the basement of a building!

325
00:19:31.563 --> 00:19:33.263
He said it's nearby.

326
00:19:34.463 --> 00:19:37.563
A building under construction nearby...

327
00:19:37.563 --> 00:19:39.663
That's it!

328
00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:42.563
Will someone go tell Mr. Mouri and the others about this?

329
00:19:42.563 --> 00:19:44.163
They should be at Kabukiza!

330
00:19:44.163 --> 00:19:46.163
Go Mitsuhiko.

331
00:19:46.163 --> 00:19:47.863
You go, Genta.

332
00:19:47.863 --> 00:19:49.963
I'm worried about Conan!

333
00:19:49.963 --> 00:19:51.963
Then, let's decide with this!

334
00:19:51.963 --> 00:19:54.063
Stone, paper, scissors!

335
00:19:54.063 --> 00:19:56.663
There...

336
00:19:59.163 --> 00:20:01.363
Why me?

337
00:20:07.963 --> 00:20:09.263
Over there?

338
00:20:09.263 --> 00:20:10.263
I'll stop them!

339
00:20:10.263 --> 00:20:13.163
Okay, good pace.

340
00:20:13.163 --> 00:20:14.963
Hey. You!

341
00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:18.963
Hey! Stop!

342
00:20:20.063 --> 00:20:21.263
What?

343
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:22.263
What's that?

344
00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.763
An earthquake?

345
00:20:23.763 --> 00:20:26.163
Oh, you're Ebizo.

346
00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:27.163
In the basement!

347
00:20:27.163 --> 00:20:28.363
There's somebody in the basement!

348
00:20:28.363 --> 00:20:29.963
What?

349
00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:31.863
This way.

350
00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:35.763
Conan!

351
00:20:35.763 --> 00:20:37.563
Over here!

352
00:20:37.563 --> 00:20:38.663
There he is!

353
00:20:38.663 --> 00:20:40.363
Oh, watch out!

354
00:20:41.463 --> 00:20:44.163
-Are you there? -Yes!

355
00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:46.663
I've come to rescue you, buddy!

356
00:20:48.063 --> 00:20:50.263
Ebizo...

357
00:20:50.263 --> 00:20:52.063
This doesn't move?

358
00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:53.663
The frame is crushed,

359
00:20:53.663 --> 00:20:55.663
so it'll take something more than a person to move it.

360
00:20:55.663 --> 00:20:56.963
Get me a wire!

361
00:20:56.963 --> 00:20:58.763
We'll do it.

362
00:20:58.763 --> 00:20:59.863
Never mind!

363
00:20:59.863 --> 00:21:02.463
Just put the hook through here and wind it!

364
00:21:02.463 --> 00:21:03.463
If something happens,

365
00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:05.563
we'll have the whole nation coming after us.

366
00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:08.063
-Conan! -Ran?

367
00:21:08.063 --> 00:21:11.063
Are you all right? I hope you're not hurt.

368
00:21:11.063 --> 00:21:13.263
Yes, I'm fine.

369
00:21:13.263 --> 00:21:16.663
Don't worry.

370
00:21:16.663 --> 00:21:19.663
Thanks, Ran.

371
00:21:19.663 --> 00:21:22.563
Conan, pass this under the door.

372
00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:24.463
Pass this through the space over to this side.

373
00:21:24.463 --> 00:21:25.963
Okay!

374
00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:27.363
Great.

375
00:21:28.363 --> 00:21:30.563
Step back a bit, okay?

376
00:21:30.563 --> 00:21:32.363
Okay!

377
00:21:32.363 --> 00:21:35.663
Okay. Pull slowly!

378
00:21:35.663 --> 00:21:37.463
Boss! No good!

379
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.563
The second floor will fall!

380
00:21:40.563 --> 00:21:42.263
Wind it!

381
00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:45.063
Support it!

382
00:21:45.063 --> 00:21:48.163
-Masa! To the right! -Roger!

383
00:21:58.563 --> 00:21:59.863
Conan.

384
00:21:59.863 --> 00:22:01.363
Ebizo.

385
00:22:13.563 --> 00:22:16.263
Honestly, that was really close.

386
00:22:16.263 --> 00:22:17.663
Really?

387
00:22:17.663 --> 00:22:20.363
You look to be saying it was still too soon to come for you.

388
00:22:20.363 --> 00:22:22.563
That would be an outright lie.

389
00:22:25.163 --> 00:22:27.263
-Conan! -Conan!

390
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.763
Later with all of that!

391
00:22:29.763 --> 00:22:33.163
Just get out of here because it's dangerous.

392
00:22:33.163 --> 00:22:37.363
Ebizo and all you others, hurry and come this way.

393
00:22:37.363 --> 00:22:40.563
Really. What a tough guy.
