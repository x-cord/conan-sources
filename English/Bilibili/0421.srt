1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.140
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.940
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.340
Let's meet once in 10 years.

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.240
The first promise, a smeared postcard.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.840
This is Dr. Agasa's love story.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:12.545
"Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 1)"

10
00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.745
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

11
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:20.145
What kind of letter is it?

12
00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:23.545
A letter in a postcard size envelope.

13
00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:31.145
I guess we've got no choice

14
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:32.445
but look for it all together.

15
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:35.245
What was the letter about, Dr. Agasa?

16
00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:38.145
It was an invitation to the wedding

17
00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:40.745
of an acquaintance doctor's son's wedding.

18
00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.745
If I remember correctly the R.S.V.P. postcard was enclosed

19
00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.145
and the deadline for answering it was today.

20
00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.545
You should have kept it carefully.

21
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:51.445
Absolutely.

22
00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:53.545
Will you stop barking up the wrong tree?

23
00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:56.545
You're all to blame for the letter getting lost too,

24
00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:58.645
since you came over to play games last night

25
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.145
and messed the place up.

26
00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:04.445
That's true.

27
00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:08.345
By the way, you look sleepy as usual.

28
00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:11.145
Bug you?

29
00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:14.545
I guess you can't help being sleepy

30
00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:17.145
since you get up early and go to school with Ayumi

31
00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:19.045
to look in on the rabbits at school.

32
00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:22.345
How come you know?

33
00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:24.245
Were you watching us?

34
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.545
I saw ginkgo leaves on the hair of you both.

35
00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:36.545
That rabbit hut is by the gingko tree lined street

36
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:37.945
behind the school yard, isn't it?

37
00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:39.145
That's about the only place,

38
00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:40.545
you can find gingko trees around here.

39
00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:43.445
Moreover, the girls were making a fuss

40
00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:45.745
over the rabbit looking sick yesterday.

41
00:03:45.745 --> 00:03:47.745
Cool.

42
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:52.645
Then, would you please hurry and look for the letter, Mr. Detective?

43
00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:54.345
Let's see.

44
00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:57.245
Dr. Agasa has a habit of putting letters

45
00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:59.345
and postcards that he finishes reading on the TV set,

46
00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.345
so behind the set is a likely place for it to be.

47
00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:02.745
But you've probably already looked there.

48
00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:06.245
There are a lot of things down here.

49
00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:08.045
See. This much.

50
00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.745
No joke?

51
00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:12.145
That's the first place you should've looked.

52
00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:16.945
Talk about a lot of things down here.

53
00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:18.045
Let's see.

54
00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:20.645
New Year's cards, midsummer greeting cards, and...

55
00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:23.645
Goodness. A driver's license renewal notice too.

56
00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:28.045
Oh My. They're all stuff that I thought I lost.

57
00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.345
Oh. What cute handwriting.

58
00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:32.645
"To Mr. Agasa" -This postcard must've been written

59
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:33.645
by a child.

60
00:04:33.645 --> 00:04:34.645
"Mr. Hiroshi Agasa"

61
00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:36.545
Oh, this is the one.

62
00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.145
Yeah! Here it is, Dr. Agasa!

63
00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:41.545
Dr. Agasa?

64
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.545
What? Have you found something good?

65
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.045
What?

66
00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:52.745
Say, that's the postcard written by a child that we saw a while ago.

67
00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:55.645
-Well... -Could it be a love letter?

68
00:04:55.645 --> 00:05:00.245
No, it's a card I received from my friend long ago.

69
00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.345
It was 40 years ago.

70
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.145
40 years ago?

71
00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:07.545
Which means that this is something back

72
00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:09.345
from when you were in the 6th grade?

73
00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:10.345
Yeah.

74
00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:14.245
It was the first day of school after summer vacation.

75
00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:18.145
I took a different road from the usual

76
00:05:18.145 --> 00:05:21.145
because I was late for school.

77
00:05:21.145 --> 00:05:22.845
Then, I saw a girl,

78
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:26.245
who was an under classman standing stalled and looking pale.

79
00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:28.745
She was a cute girl with big round eyes

80
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.645
that could be seen from the cap that she wore quite deeply.

81
00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.845
It seems that she was scared of the barking dog

82
00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:37.145
and was stalled because of it.

83
00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:40.145
Well, a person named Mr. Noi owned a big dog,

84
00:05:40.145 --> 00:05:43.045
and it was also well-known in the neighborhood

85
00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:45.045
so I guess it couldn't be helped.

86
00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:48.445
She looked so scared, despite hiding behind me

87
00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:52.045
when passing by the dog, that I asked her why.

88
00:05:52.045 --> 00:05:53.545
She told me that she had been bitten by a dog

89
00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.345
that she had when she was little,

90
00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:58.645
and that she had become to hate animals since then.

91
00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:04.245
I felt sorry for her plight,

92
00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:06.145
so I took her to the place of an acquaintance

93
00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:09.345
named Mr. Chono who kept a hamster.

94
00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:11.845
She was scared at first,

95
00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:15.245
but she seemed to get used to as the days went by.

96
00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:19.345
After two months, she turned into an animal lover.

97
00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:23.945
She could even laugh when passing in front of Mr. Noi's dog.

98
00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:28.645
So, you and that girl went to school together every day, right?

99
00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:31.345
Yeah, I guess so.

100
00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:34.645
Only during fall of that year, though...

101
00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:36.345
Only during fall?

102
00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:40.145
Right. On a rainy morning at the end of November,

103
00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:42.845
I was waiting like always in front of the Mr. Noi residence

104
00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:45.845
for her to come but,

105
00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:49.045
no matter how long I waited she didn't show up.

106
00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:50.745
Worried that she may have caught cold or something

107
00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.845
I went to her house after school

108
00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.645
too check things out but,

109
00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:59.045
the lady next door told me she had moved that morning.

110
00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:02.045
She moved?

111
00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:03.745
Without telling you?

112
00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:06.345
She could've at least said goodbye.

113
00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:07.545
No.

114
00:07:07.545 --> 00:07:09.445
She probably...

115
00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:12.745
She probably couldn't even if she wanted to.

116
00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:16.845
Goodbye, is a sad word

117
00:07:16.845 --> 00:07:19.045
that pricks the heart like a needle.

118
00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:20.945
It can't be.

119
00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:25.945
But, it's too sad leaving without saying a word.

120
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:29.145
No, she did thank me.

121
00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:33.645
I found that postcard in the mailbox of my house that day.

122
00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:39.745
But, there isn't any stamp on the postcard.

123
00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:43.545
She probably put it in the mailbox of your house herself,

124
00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:44.645
just before she moved.

125
00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:47.045
And? What's written on it?

126
00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:48.145
Oh...

127
00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:50.245
Thank you for the three months.

128
00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:53.245
It was a lot of fun being with you.

129
00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:54.645
I don't like goodbye, so I want to say,

130
00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:55.845
let's meet again.

131
00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:57.445
10 years later, on this day,

132
00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:01.145
before the sun sets at that memorable place.

133
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:03.745
If I can't see you then, 10 years after that will do.

134
00:08:03.745 --> 00:08:06.245
I'll wait for you even if I grow to be a grandmother.

135
00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:08.845
Come see me if you have the time.

136
00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:11.945
To Hiroshi Agasa who I like, like, like very much.

137
00:08:11.945 --> 00:08:15.745
November 24th, 4th grade, class A,

138
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.545
Kinoshita...

139
00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:19.345
The words are smeared that I can't read it.

140
00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:22.445
It probably got wet in the rain

141
00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:24.645
when she was putting it in the mailbox.

142
00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:27.745
And, did you get to see her? Ms. Kinoshita.

143
00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:32.045
No, I don't know where that memorable place is you see...

144
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.545
Hey, hey...

145
00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:37.945
But... Isn't November 24th today?

146
00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:41.145
And it's exactly 40 years ago...

147
00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:43.545
Maybe that girl...

148
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:46.045
She is waiting for you there today too!

149
00:08:46.045 --> 00:08:49.845
But, if Dr. Agasa can't remember the place.

150
00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:53.445
So... I'm sorry...

151
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:55.045
Really...

152
00:08:55.045 --> 00:08:59.545
You've always been dense when it came to things like this from before.

153
00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:04.545
Hey, maybe it's the place where that scary dog was?

154
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:07.845
I see. The place where you first met each other.

155
00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:10.845
I thought so too, so I went there 10 years later

156
00:09:10.845 --> 00:09:12.745
and waited for her there for a long time,

157
00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:14.345
but no one came.

158
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.045
Then, what about the house of the person who had the hamster?

159
00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:19.545
I went to his house 20 years later,

160
00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:22.345
one day before and spent the night there.

161
00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:25.745
Too bad, she didn't show up though.

162
00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:29.145
I'm sure she was waiting elsewhere.

163
00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:32.045
You never got a letter from her after that?

164
00:09:32.045 --> 00:09:34.645
No. She had the address of my parent's home,

165
00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:37.845
but my parents moved to the country too so.

166
00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:41.145
Then, why don't you write her?

167
00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:43.045
I don't know her address or her name,

168
00:09:43.045 --> 00:09:44.945
so I can't even if I wanted to.

169
00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:46.745
What? You don't know her name?

170
00:09:46.745 --> 00:09:50.845
I think you can easily get it at the grade school you went to?

171
00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:52.845
Of course, I thought of asking her.

172
00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:54.945
But I figured I could see her 10 years later anyway,

173
00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:56.945
so I didn't.

174
00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:57.945
That's right!

175
00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.545
You went to Teitan Elementary school too, didn't you, Dr. Agasa?

176
00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:02.545
Then, maybe we can give them a call?

177
00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:05.745
Oh, but there's no school today,

178
00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:08.245
so only the custodian is there.

179
00:10:08.245 --> 00:10:09.945
Besides, if by chance you're able to find out

180
00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:11.945
what her name and address are,

181
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.145
and if you fortunately are able to get in touch with her

182
00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:18.145
and see her, maybe all you'll be doing is hurting her feelings?

183
00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:22.645
Dr. Agasa didn't know what place she thought was important,

184
00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:26.245
and the fact that he made her wait meaninglessly

185
00:10:26.245 --> 00:10:27.945
for 40 years is going to be revealed.

186
00:10:29.745 --> 00:10:31.745
I don't think you need to take it that far.

187
00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:37.545
That is, only if she's waiting there today.

188
00:10:37.545 --> 00:10:41.245
Then, Dr. Agasa's going to have to remember the place

189
00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:42.845
and go see her after all.

190
00:10:42.845 --> 00:10:48.545
But, it's already been 40 years, so remembering is...

191
00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:51.545
But we've got clues.

192
00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:53.245
Clues?

193
00:10:53.245 --> 00:10:54.245
"To Mr. Agasa" -See,

194
00:10:54.245 --> 00:10:55.445
"The Hint Is: Animal" -below the name of the addressee,

195
00:10:55.445 --> 00:10:57.645
you can see a row of numbers, right?

196
00:10:57.645 --> 00:11:01.745
"The Hint Is: Animal" -This could be a code that indicates the place.

197
00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:05.545
-Really. -But, what does it mean?

198
00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:10.745
4163, 33, 6, 0.

199
00:11:10.745 --> 00:11:13.745
It says here that the hint is an animal.

200
00:11:13.745 --> 00:11:16.245
Hey, Dr. Agasa, what does this mean?

201
00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:17.545
Well...

202
00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:20.445
If you knew, you would've met her already, right?

203
00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:21.945
I'm ashamed.

204
00:11:21.945 --> 00:11:23.845
But, maybe you can solve it, Conan.

205
00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:25.545
Nope, I don't have the slightest idea.

206
00:11:25.545 --> 00:11:27.045
I see.

207
00:11:27.045 --> 00:11:31.445
Hey, if she's only waiting till sundown,

208
00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:34.745
you only have about four hours left.

209
00:11:34.745 --> 00:11:37.445
Then, I guess we have no choice but to go to Sleeping Kogoro

210
00:11:37.445 --> 00:11:40.345
and have him decipher the code.

211
00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:46.045
Pops is at the joint live concert of Yoko Okino and Misa Nakayama,

212
00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:47.145
so he's not in now.

213
00:11:47.145 --> 00:11:48.145
What?

214
00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:49.745
Misa?

215
00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:51.145
Did you remember something?

216
00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:53.945
The first name of the person called Kinoshita.

217
00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:57.245
I sort of think her name was something like that.

218
00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:59.845
Hey, if Sleeping Kogoro's not around,

219
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:03.345
maybe we should ask Sonoko?

220
00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:08.245
Right. She was bragging that she solved a case the other day too.

221
00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:10.845
Sonoko's not around either.

222
00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:13.845
She's out with Ran since this morning standing in line

223
00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:16.245
to buy a brand-name handbag that's going on sale just today.

224
00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:19.245
Besides, if I can't solve it,

225
00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:21.945
those two wouldn't be able to solve it either.

226
00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:23.645
Oh, it's the one that's on sale

227
00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:28.045
in commemoration of Fusae Campbell's visit to Japan.

228
00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:29.545
Fusae?

229
00:12:29.545 --> 00:12:32.845
It could've been that sort of name too.

230
00:12:33.845 --> 00:12:35.145
No, wait... Misae...

231
00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:37.545
No, or was it Fusako?

232
00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:43.345
I wonder what's so good about that leaf-patterned handbag.

233
00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:44.945
It' s expensive, isn't it?

234
00:12:44.945 --> 00:12:47.345
The "Fusae Brand" handbag are not leaf-patterned, those are ginkgos.

235
00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:49.445
They're the trademark of the "Fusae brand".

236
00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:52.645
And, not all the items are that expensive.

237
00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:57.245
That brand has a number of reasonably priced items too.

238
00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.245
A number?

239
00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:02.045
Will you show it to me, Conan?

240
00:13:02.045 --> 00:13:03.845
What's up, Ayumi?

241
00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:06.145
Hey, maybe this code

242
00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:09.745
has something to do with the number of animals at our school.

243
00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:16.345
Well, there are six rabbits, chickens, society finches and pigeons.

244
00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:19.045
All the birds added together make a total of 33 birds, right?

245
00:13:19.045 --> 00:13:20.345
Then, what about the zero?

246
00:13:21.345 --> 00:13:23.045
That's the number of turtles

247
00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:24.745
that died during summer vacation.

248
00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:27.945
No way.

249
00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:29.445
When I was in elementary school,

250
00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.745
the turtle was still alive and kicking,

251
00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:36.745
and the only animal other than that were the chickens.

252
00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:41.145
Besides, the first numbers 4163 are unexplained, right?

253
00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:43.045
Oh, that's right.

254
00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:47.445
But, turtles live long, don't they to be alive for 40 years?

255
00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:50.245
No, that's actually the 3rd turtle,

256
00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:52.645
and it's rumored that each time a turtle dies,

257
00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:54.445
a new one is brought over from the zoo.

258
00:13:54.445 --> 00:13:56.845
That's true.

259
00:13:56.845 --> 00:13:58.945
A graduate of Teitan Elementary school,

260
00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:01.545
and the first head of the Tohto Zoo,

261
00:14:01.545 --> 00:14:03.945
Mr. Yoichirou Kobata,

262
00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:06.145
in hopes of wanting the children to live

263
00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:09.845
a long life gave the turtle to the school as a gift.

264
00:14:09.845 --> 00:14:12.245
They say that turtles live a million years too.

265
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:17.045
Dr. Agasa, what did you just say?

266
00:14:17.045 --> 00:14:18.645
Turtles live a million years?

267
00:14:18.645 --> 00:14:22.945
No. The name of the first head of Tohto Zoo.

268
00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.045
He said, Kobata...

269
00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:26.645
Mr. Yoichirou?

270
00:14:26.645 --> 00:14:28.245
"Four" -Yo... (In Japanese 4)

271
00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:29.245
"One, Six" -Ichirou... (1 and 6)

272
00:14:29.245 --> 00:14:30.945
"Three" -San... (means Mr.)

273
00:14:30.945 --> 00:14:32.545
-That's it! -That's it!

274
00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:33.845
Hey, hey...

275
00:14:33.845 --> 00:14:34.945
Oh, boy.

276
00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:45.366
"Tohto Zoo"

277
00:14:57.266 --> 00:14:59.866
Hey, look good and hard.

278
00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:03.866
Yes. She's sure to be here somewhere.

279
00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:06.066
Dr. Agasa's first love.

280
00:15:06.066 --> 00:15:08.266
We'll get her for sure.

281
00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:09.666
-Yeah! -Yeah!

282
00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:13.866
Hey. I never said she was my love.

283
00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:15.266
It's so obvious.

284
00:15:23.266 --> 00:15:26.766
Well, even if I were to believe what they said

285
00:15:26.766 --> 00:15:29.466
about 4163 being Mr. Yoichirou.

286
00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:32.866
The connection with 33, 6, and 0 that comes after that is not solved...

287
00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:36.266
Pandas are cute after all.

288
00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:37.466
Yeah.

289
00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:39.766
I'd like to have one.

290
00:15:39.766 --> 00:15:41.266
Hey, you guys...

291
00:15:41.266 --> 00:15:44.766
Hey, I wonder what that number is?

292
00:15:44.766 --> 00:15:48.466
See, the number that is written on the name plate of the animals.

293
00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:55.466
The numbers are probably designated to categorize the animals.

294
00:15:55.466 --> 00:15:57.866
But the numbers are picked too much at random.

295
00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:01.566
The numbers are designated in the order

296
00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:03.866
in which the animals came into the zoo.

297
00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:07.766
Therefore, the panda was the 58th animal that was put in here.

298
00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:11.166
Then, which animal is the 33rd?

299
00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:13.166
If I remember correctly, I think it was a donkey?

300
00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:14.266
Donkey?

301
00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:15.466
I get it.

302
00:16:15.466 --> 00:16:17.166
"Mr. Yoichirou" -The 33rd animal that...

303
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:19.366
"33rd animal" -Yoichirou put in the zoo...

304
00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:20.566
"Donkey" -Was a donkey!

305
00:16:22.766 --> 00:16:24.266
That's it!

306
00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:28.366
Hey! The zero hasn't been figured out yet.

307
00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:29.566
Hurry up, hurry up!

308
00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:31.166
-Yes! -Yes!

309
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.366
They've been switched on.

310
00:16:36.966 --> 00:16:40.566
Number 33, number 33, number 33.

311
00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.066
Donkey, donkey, donkey.

312
00:16:43.066 --> 00:16:45.966
Woman, woman, woman.

313
00:16:45.966 --> 00:16:48.166
"33, Donkey"

314
00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:52.266
Number 33!

315
00:16:52.266 --> 00:16:53.366
Donkey!

316
00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:54.366
Woman!

317
00:16:55.366 --> 00:16:57.166
-Found her! -Found her!

318
00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.566
Hey, you guys...

319
00:16:58.566 --> 00:17:01.266
There she is. There she is.

320
00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:02.266
No joke?

321
00:17:06.466 --> 00:17:09.366
She's wearing a hat so it's probably her, right?

322
00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:11.366
Let's try asking her then.

323
00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:12.766
Hey.

324
00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.866
-Excuse me. -Excuse me.

325
00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:24.866
Aren't you?

326
00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:28.866
Oh, Mr. Hiroshi Agasa?

327
00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:32.166
It's been a long time.

328
00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:35.566
Yes, 40 years, is it?

329
00:17:35.566 --> 00:17:38.466
You sure lost a lot of hair.

330
00:17:38.466 --> 00:17:40.166
No.

331
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:42.966
Then, don't tell me that

332
00:17:42.966 --> 00:17:44.866
this grandmother is...

333
00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.866
the one with the big round eyes...

334
00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.966
Of 40 years ago...

335
00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:51.766
Your first love?

336
00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:56.766
I guess this is a typical case of time beautifying all things.

337
00:17:56.766 --> 00:18:00.066
But don't you think she looks a bit too old?

338
00:18:00.066 --> 00:18:03.266
When Dr. Agasa was in the 6th grade,

339
00:18:03.266 --> 00:18:05.666
she was in the 4th grade, right?

340
00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:09.366
If so, she should be around 49 or 50 years old.

341
00:18:10.566 --> 00:18:13.366
Maybe she went through a lot of hard times.

342
00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:14.466
I guess so.

343
00:18:14.466 --> 00:18:16.366
Well then, see you then.

344
00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:18.866
Yeah. Take care.

345
00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:21.966
Hey... Are you done already?

346
00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:23.866
She's your first love, isn't she?

347
00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:26.866
No... She's Mrs. Noi.

348
00:18:26.866 --> 00:18:27.866
I told you about her, didn't I?

349
00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:29.566
She's the owner of the big dog

350
00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:32.666
that used to bark a lot on our way back from school.

351
00:18:32.666 --> 00:18:35.466
The grand-dog of that dog seems to have died last month,

352
00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:39.166
and she got lonely so she came to the zoo.

353
00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:40.266
What?

354
00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:41.966
Wrong person.

355
00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:45.266
I thought she was a bit too old.

356
00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.566
But, how strange.

357
00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:52.066
If the place you are to meet her is the code 4163,

358
00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:54.266
it's about the head of the zoo,

359
00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:56.766
Mr. Yoichirou Kobata, and,

360
00:18:56.766 --> 00:19:00.466
if three, three designates the 33rd animal that came here,

361
00:19:00.466 --> 00:19:02.366
and if six is a donkey,

362
00:19:02.366 --> 00:19:05.466
she supposed to be waiting here.

363
00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:06.866
I told you, right?

364
00:19:06.866 --> 00:19:09.466
That the last zero hasn't been solved yet.

365
00:19:09.466 --> 00:19:14.666
And? Can't you remember anything else that would could be a hint?

366
00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:18.566
Nothing other than that her eyes were big

367
00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:21.966
and that her last name was Kinoshita.

368
00:19:21.966 --> 00:19:25.766
And also that she liked to take care of the chickens at school.

369
00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.266
She had freckles on her cheeks,

370
00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:31.566
and for some reason always wore her cap deeply over her head.

371
00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:33.466
That's about it.

372
00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:35.866
Always?

373
00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:38.866
Yeah. On the way to school and back.

374
00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:42.266
Of course I think she took it off during class, though.

375
00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:44.266
I wonder if there was a reason for her wearing the cap?

376
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.966
She wasn't bald.

377
00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:49.066
She was probably a very shy girl.

378
00:19:49.066 --> 00:19:51.666
Then we have no choice but to figure out

379
00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:53.666
the code and find the place after all.

380
00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:58.866
Let's say that 4163 is this zoo.

381
00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:02.766
The problem is the number three, three, six and zero.

382
00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:04.566
"Mimimure" -Mimimure...

383
00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:05.966
"Mimiroku" -Mimiroku...

384
00:20:06.966 --> 00:20:10.166
Hey, maybe it's about an owl?

385
00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:14.066
If it's an owl, the numbers would be three, three, two, nine.

386
00:20:14.066 --> 00:20:15.766
"Sasarokuwa" -Sasarokuwa...

387
00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:17.566
"Sasarokure" -Sasarokure...

388
00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:18.866
"Sasamu" -Sasamu...

389
00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:21.466
Flying squirrel (Musasabi)!

390
00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:24.466
How silly. Then it would be the same as before.

391
00:20:24.466 --> 00:20:26.666
The meaning of zero is not solved, is it?

392
00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:30.066
No. Not really.

393
00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:31.866
It says on the postcard,

394
00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:36.366
let's meet before the sun sets, right?

395
00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:38.566
Flying squirrels are nocturnal animals

396
00:20:38.566 --> 00:20:40.166
that move about only at night.

397
00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:42.266
In other words, before the sun sets it is asleep in its nest,

398
00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:44.166
and the number of flying squirrels

399
00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:47.166
that meet the eyes of the zoo comers is...

400
00:20:48.266 --> 00:20:49.266
Zero!

401
00:20:49.266 --> 00:20:51.366
Is zero flying squirrels.

402
00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:56.366
But, are there animals at the zoo that you only get to see at night?

403
00:20:56.366 --> 00:20:57.466
Stupid.

404
00:20:57.466 --> 00:21:01.666
Cages are set up indoors in most zoos

405
00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:04.166
so that nocturnal animals can also be viewed.

406
00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:06.666
Okay, let's go then.

407
00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:07.866
-Yeah! -Yeah!

408
00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:10.066
"Nocturnal Animals Building"

409
00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:11.566
Really...

410
00:21:11.566 --> 00:21:13.466
It's full of nocturnal animals.

411
00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:17.866
But, it's full of bats and snakes that it's kind of eerie.

412
00:21:17.866 --> 00:21:18.866
Yes.

413
00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:22.066
Let's see. Flying squirrels, flying squirrels.

414
00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:28.766
There they are!

415
00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:30.166
The flying squirrels!

416
00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:33.966
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

417
00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:38.766
She seems to be waiting for someone.

418
00:21:38.766 --> 00:21:42.966
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

419
00:21:42.966 --> 00:21:45.866
See. You're meeting her after 40 years,

420
00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:47.366
so go do your thing.

421
00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:48.366
Yeah.

422
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.366
"Next Episode" -Then, don't tell me that...

423
00:23:48.366 --> 00:23:49.666
It can't be that...

424
00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:50.766
Blonde?

425
00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:52.566
As for memories about her,

426
00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:57.066
I will keep it untouched and beautiful as it used to be within my heart.

427
00:24:02.766 --> 00:24:04.266
I see, so that's it.

428
00:24:05.266 --> 00:24:07.566
I got it, Dr. Agasa.

429
00:24:07.566 --> 00:24:10.066
The memorable place that she's waiting for you.

430
00:24:11.066 --> 00:24:16.466
Next Conan, "Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 2)"

431
00:24:17.434 --> 00:24:19.634
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:19.634 --> 00:24:21.834
"Blonde"

433
00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:23.034
Ai's first love is?

434
00:24:23.034 --> 00:24:24.034
Dr. Agasa.

435
00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:25.034
Just joking.
