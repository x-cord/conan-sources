1
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Look, look!

2
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,800
There's a dinosaur.

3
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,700
Fine!

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Just in a blink of an eye and he's gone.

5
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,300
Take it, you must be thirsty.

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Thank you.

7
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh no! Only three minutes left!

8
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,000
What's wrong, Shinichi?

9
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,300
Great! We made it.

10
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,200
Where is this? Just an ordinary square.

11
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,800
Just wait and see.

12
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,700
10.

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,000
9.

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
8.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,300
7.

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,700
6.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,900
5.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,900
4.

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,100
3.

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
2.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,700
1.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,500
The fountain here sprays every two hours.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,300
I remember you love this feeling the most, right?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,100
Shinichi.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
This is my gift to you to celebrate your victory
in the karate competition.

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,900
You must cherish this gift.

28
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,200
Come on, this is no big deal, all right?

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,300
It's a rainbow.

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,200
Great, let's drink to that.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,700
Okay.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,700
You look so funny.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,100
(Detective Conan   Captured in Her Eyes)

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,000
I am high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,800
When I went to the amusement park
with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,

36
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
I witnessed a suspicious transaction made by a man in black.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I was too preoccupied with watching at that time,

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,500
and didn't notice another accomplice approaching from behind.

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,400
He made me take the poison by force.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
When I woke up,

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
my body became smaller.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,100
If those guys knew that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,630
not only would my life be in danger,

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,600
but I would also endanger my families and friends around me.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,300
At the suggestion of Professor Agasa,
I concealed my true identity.

46
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,300
When Ran asked for my name,

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
I came up with the name of Conan Edogawa.

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
In order to collect information about those guys,

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,700
I moved in with Ran whose father is a detective.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,500
Detective Mouri!

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,300
Please talk about the logic of your deduction this time.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,800
Actually, I don't remember much.

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,700
Of course he doesn't remember. Because every time,

54
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,500
I would use Stun-Gun Wristwatch to make him unconscious,

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,300
and then use Voice-Changing Bowtie

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,700
to solve the case with Uncle Mouri's voice.

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,800
Both are invented by Professor Agasa.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,100
Nice to meet you.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,600
In addition, the Professor also invented

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,800
Turbo Engine Skateboard,

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
Criminal Tracking Glasses,

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Power-Enhancing Kick Shoes

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,800
and all kinds of unique gadgets.

64
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,000
Neither Ran nor Uncle Mouri realized my true identity.

65
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
The only ones who know about this are Professor Agasa,

66
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,500
Heiji Hattori, a high school detective from Kansai,

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,000
and Ai Haibara, my classmate.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
She used to work with those men in black.

69
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,300
When she escaped from the organization,

70
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,100
she took the same drug as me.

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,700
After that, her body has also become smaller.

72
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
Black Organization remains a mystery,

73
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,600
but now between Ran and me,

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
there is a thick and tall barrier.

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Although my body is smaller, my mind is still flexible.

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
I am the famous omniscient detective.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,100
Only one truth will prevail!

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Fountain?

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah. The rainbow emerged afterwards was really beautiful, right?

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Yeah, right.

81
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,300
Come on, why does she always remember those boring things?

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's go back to Tropical Land later.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
We haven't been there since that day.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,600
That's because I've become smaller since that day.

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,400
When should we go?

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,500
Well...

87
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,300
I don't know if Conan-kun is home.

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,700
Yes, I don't know either.

89
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,400
It would be bad if he's not home.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Sorry, Ran.

91
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,500
I have a case to handle.

92
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,700
I'll call you later. Bye.

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Wait a minute, Shinichi.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Fine!

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,700
Case, case, case...

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
A jerk who only cares about cases!

97
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Conan-kun definitely can't guess the right answer this time!

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
I wish I could have seen him admit defeat earlier.

99
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,400
Conan-kun admitted defeat.

100
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,300
I admit defeat. I am a loser.

101
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,300
What are you three smirking at?

102
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Conan-kun.

103
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,300
You're just in time.

104
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,200
We were just about to go find you.

105
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,100
We came up with an ultimate IQ quiz!

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,200
IQ quiz?

107
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,000
Listen carefully.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
When we asked Haibara-san

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,800
what kind of person she thought Conan-kun was,

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
she looked at the moon and said, "I can't say he's summer."

111
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,300
Haibara-san was: one, complimenting you;

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
two, belittling you.

113
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,800
Which is the answer?

114
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
She couldn't say I was summer.

115
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,800
Moon... I see.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
The answer is two.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Why?

118
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,800
The summer moon appears in June, July and August.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
It means "not a normal human being".

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
Awesome. Conan knows everything.

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,700
It's not funny at all.

122
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,700
By the way, what were you smirking at?

123
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Then, are you willing to admit defeat?

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,500
Cross the road!

125
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,800
Wait! You can't cross!

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,900
The flashing green light indicates
the same meaning as the yellow light.

127
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,900
You should wait for the next green light to cross.

128
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
Yes, sir.

129
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,700
We were lectured all of a sudden.

130
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,500
Anyway, that man was right.

131
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
This time it's my turn to ask the question.

132
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,200
What is his profession?

133
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,700
Is he a school teacher?

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
He doesn't look like a salesman either.
He doesn't have a briefcase.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
Is he an Unadon vendor?

136
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
The answer is a police officer.

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
A police officer?

138
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,200
When taking notes,

139
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,500
police officers always open the police manuals
in landscape orientation,

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,800
and then make notes in landscape orientation.

141
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,300
So that's it.

142
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,500
Conan is amazing.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,100
You really know everything.

144
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,400
The light has turned green. Let's go.

145
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,100
Okay!

146
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,000
The police officer was shot!

147
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,300
That person is the murderer!

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,200
I won't let you escape!

149
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,700
Conan-kun, watch out!

150
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Call an ambulance!

151
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,500
I see!

152
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,600
Damn, he got away!

153
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,700
Officer, hang in there!

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Who shot at you?

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,300
What?

156
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,400
At around 2:00 p.m. today,

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,100
current police officer Osamu Narasawa was shot dead

158
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
near a traffic light in Beika Park.

159
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
The killer is still at large.

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,400
The Metropolitan Police Department has sent extra police support

161
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,200
and has set up the research headquarters at Beika Police Station.

162
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm sorry, but I must ask you some questions again.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
What are the characteristics of the killer?

164
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
He's a young man.

165
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,800
No, she's a beautiful young woman.

166
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,300
You're wrong. He's a middle-aged man.

167
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,200
And what color was the umbrella he was holding?

168
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,900
It was a black umbrella.

169
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,800
It was a green one! Green!

170
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,500
I remember it was blue.

171
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,100
Did you really see the killer?

172
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,500
Conan-kun, can you tell me?

173
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Both his raincoat and umbrella are gray.

174
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I don't know if the killer is a man or a woman.

175
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,500
But that person was holding the umbrella with the right hand.

176
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,100
So, he used his left hand to shoot.

177
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,500
The murderer is left-handed.

178
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,200
Inspector Megure, if you don't mind,

179
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,700
why did Officer Narasawa clutch his left chest when he died?

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,200
He was trying to suggest the police manual on his chest.

181
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
We've found that out.

182
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,700
We are currently working on

183
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
investigating the contents of the manual.

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,900
Inspector Megure.

185
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,900
Judging from the bullet casings left at the scene,

186
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,300
the pistol used by the killer

187
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,700
is a 9 mm automatic pistol.

188
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
9 mm caliber...

189
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,700
That kind of pistol is generally used by women.

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,100
Luckily, all of you were not involved.

191
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
Conan-kun, you too.

192
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Damn, if the light hadn't changed to red,

193
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
I wouldn't have lost him.

194
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,600
(The Current Police Officer Got Killed in His Own Basement)

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
(Was It the Work of a Radical?)

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,400
(The Police Force is Facing a Challenge)

197
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,000
It's Megure.

198
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh, it's you, Mouri.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,900
Inspector Megure.

200
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,400
I want to ask you more about last night's case.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,300
Sorry, I'm being busy.

202
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,400
I'll call you later.

203
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,100
Hello, hello! Inspector Megure?

204
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
What's wrong?

205
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,200
He said he was busy.

206
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
Of course.

207
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
There are already two police officers who died.

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He's really different from his usual self.

209
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,900
Listen up, Shiratori.

210
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,000
This case is a secret within the police department.

211
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,100
You must not mention it to anyone.

212
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,000
I understand.

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,500
Two current police officers were shot dead.

214
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,000
The bullet casings left at the scene are exactly the same.

215
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,800
The police have confirmed that
both were killed by the same murderer.

216
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,300
The relevant clues are still under investigation.

217
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Next is the weather report.

218
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,780
(Beika Sun Plaza Hotel)

219
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,800
What the hell?

220
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Officer Shiratori's sister really chose a good timing.

221
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,300
How come she's gonna hold the wedding party
at this time like this?

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,300
I guess she has no choice.

223
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,500
The date was set a month ago.

224
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,100
Anyway, we can't blame her for this.

225
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,900
Besides, it's not some kind of wedding party.

226
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,600
It's just a wedding celebration.

227
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
The organizer is a friend of the bride and groom.

228
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
I got it, all right?

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,100
What do you think the groom, Haretsuki, will be like?

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,900
I heard he's a painter.

231
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,800
A little-known painter, to be exact.

232
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
A little-known painter?

233
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,300
If so, then I'll give up making friends with him.

234
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Your handwriting is as ugly as before.

235
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,900
Mom!

236
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,000
They also invited you?

237
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Yes, Sara's a legal intern now.

238
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Naturally, we know each other.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Auntie, your handwriting is so beautiful.

240
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,400
Funny. You're a couple. Why are you signing separately?

241
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,500
Sorry to trouble you.

242
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,700
I'll put your bag in locker 87.

243
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,700
We're going, Conan-kun.

244
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,200
Wow, there are so many people here.

245
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,000
Inspector Megure is here too.

246
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,200
You can tell a policeman at a glance.

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
Their eyes are always sharp.

248
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,400
They always have serious expressions.

249
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
It's hardly surprising.

250
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,800
Because of that case,

251
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
it's impossible for them to think of anything else.

252
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
But Officer Sato is always cheerful.

253
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,500
What do you think? Clothes make the man, right?

254
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
No such thing.

255
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,900
You're already pretty.

256
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,200
It's Director Odagiri. I gotta go and say hello to him.

257
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,400
Who is he?

258
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,900
Director Odagiri.

259
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,120
When your father was a young and inexperienced detective,

260
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,300
he was just a division chief.

261
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,600
Now he's already the Director-general
of the Criminal Affairs Bureau.

262
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,300
Distinguished guests, sorry to keep you waiting.

263
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Now we have the bride and groom coming out.

264
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,000
Please give a warm applause to welcome them.

265
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,500
So beautiful!

266
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,500
Kotaro, Sara, congratulations!

267
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Mouri-san.

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
Congratulations!

269
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Thank you.

270
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,200
Let me introduce you.

271
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,200
This is my attending physician.

272
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,800
Dr. Kazato from department of cardiology
of Beika Yakushi Hospital.

273
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,400
My family name is Kazato. Nice to see you.

274
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Mine is Mouri.

275
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,300
This is my wife Eri and my daughter Ran.

276
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,000
This is Conan. He temporarily lives in my house.

277
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,100
Is it necessary to say "temporarily lives"?

278
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,200
So, Officer Shiratori, you are seeing a psychiatrist?

279
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,300
Well, actually, there are a lot of annoying things at work.

280
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,600
I have no other choice.

281
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,200
Mouri-san, I think you'd better come to see a psychiatrist too.

282
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,100
Indeed. These days my memory...

283
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,000
Nonsense! What do you mean?

284
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're in no position to laugh at me, all right?

285
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,600
It hurts!

286
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Would you excuse me for just a minute?

287
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Inspector Megure!

288
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,600
Oh, Mouri-kun.

289
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,400
How's the follow-up investigation going?

290
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,600
Sorry, I don't want to talk about it.

291
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
Why doesn't he talk to me?

292
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,300
There must be something he can't tell you.

293
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,700
Is that so, Takagi?

294
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,200
No such thing.

295
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,700
Officer Takagi, you like Officer Sato, don't you?

296
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,300
That's interesting.

297
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,200
Then, let me be your messenger of love.

298
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,400
Wait, I'll tell you.

299
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,600
But you gotta promise me you won't tell reporters.

300
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,000
In fact, Officer Shiba died holding a police manual.

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
What?

302
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,200
If so...

303
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,300
Mouri-san, you don't need to ask any further questions.

304
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,800
Need not to know.

305
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,600
Now you understand, don't you?

306
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
"Need not to know"?

307
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,800
Does that mean I don't need to know about this thing?

308
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,500
How can that be?

309
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Need not to know.

310
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,800
This is a common jargon among police officers.

311
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
Is it possible that the murderer

312
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,100
is related to the police force?

313
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
And the relationship is unusual.

314
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,800
Maybe he's some top person at the police force.

315
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,800
Or even he can influence the entire police organization.

316
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,800
He never proposed to you or did something like that?

317
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, he's not good at saying that kind of thing.

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,700
For me, this kind of man is better.

319
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
I don't like those honey-lipped guys. They're all cunning.

320
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Mom, I've been meaning to ask you.

321
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,600
How did Dad propose to you?

322
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,800
By speaking those nasty words, of course.

323
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
Sensei, tell us about it.

324
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
But I've forgotten all.

325
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,000
Come on, drop the act.

326
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
I can use it as a reference for the future.

327
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Mom, don't be so secretive.

328
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,500
I think he was saying, I love you so, so much.

329
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,300
I love you more than any other person on this planet.

330
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,700
No way...

331
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,400
How romantic!

332
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,300
If Shinichi had said the same things to me...

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
I can tell what you're thinking at a glance.

334
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
I'm not!

335
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,300
What's wrong, Ran-nee-chan?

336
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,700
Your face is so red.

337
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
It's nothing.

338
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,100
Toshiya, this is not a place for you.

339
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,300
I don't think you've been invited to this party.

340
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,500
Stop nagging!

341
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
I came to this hotel only because of work.

342
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,500
That's his son, Toshiya-san.

343
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,800
I heard he's in a rock band.

344
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,200
Don't be angry, Director.

345
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
Toshiya-kun, you can stay...

346
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,400
Get out!

347
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,400
Don't come here looking for food, you wild dog.

348
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,700
What did you say?

349
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,500
Toshiya-san.

350
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Sorry to have disturbed you all.

351
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,300
Toshiya-kun!

352
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I think I've seen that woman somewhere.

353
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,000
Sato-kun.

354
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
About that thing...

355
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm fine.

356
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,500
But...

357
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,400
Don't worry about me.

358
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Locker 38, please.

359
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,700
Okay.

360
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,500
Ran-chan, it's you.

361
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,700
Officer Sato.

362
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,500
It's a weird party with all the cops here, isn't it?

363
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,200
It's okay, but then again...

364
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,500
Officer Sato, you should be careful.

365
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,200
What do you mean?

366
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,800
There are so many police officers killed
one after another these days.

367
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,900
Don't worry, It's not that easy to kill me.

368
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,200
What's wrong?

369
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,800
The power is out.

370
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,000
What happened?

371
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,400
It's really strange.

372
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I'll go check it out. You stay here.

373
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,900
Officer Sato, there's a flashlight here.

374
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,400
What?

375
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,900
Look.

376
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,500
Ran-san, put it down!

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Officer Sato!

378
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,500
Officer Sato!

379
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,600
Officer Sato, hang in there!

380
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,100
It's my fault.

381
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
It's all my fault for taking the flashlight.

382
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Ran!

383
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,900
Officer Sato!

384
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,800
Ran, are you all right?

385
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Ran-nee-chan just passed out.

386
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
The one who is seriously injured was...

387
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,800
Officer Sato!

388
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,900
Officer Sato, hang in there!

389
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,600
This is...

390
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,100
Megure, call an ambulance!

391
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,700
Shiratori, block all the entrances and exits of the hotel.

392
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,300
Yes, sir.

393
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,000
Hello? This is the 15th floor of the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel.

394
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,500
A woman was shot.

395
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,200
Please send an ambulance immediately.

396
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,800
The magazine is empty.

397
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,500
9 mm automatic pistol.

398
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,300
The murderer is the same person.

399
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,200
But, why is there a flashlight here?

400
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,500
Hurry up!

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
Block all entrances and exits!

402
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,200
Everyone except children must be identified for gunshot residues.

403
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,100
No one is exempt.

404
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,700
Including me and all the police officers.

405
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,400
Of course, this bastard is included too.

406
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
Why is he still here?

407
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,900
But those two person are gone.

408
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:37,800
(Beika Yakushi Hospital)

409
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Inspector Megure, how is Officer Sato?

410
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,300
A bullet struck close to her heart.

411
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,500
She only have a 50% chance of survival.

412
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
Inspector Megure, how about Ran?

413
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,600
Luckily, she's not injured, but she's not awake yet.

414
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,500
Her ward is over there.

415
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,700
Ran should be fine.

416
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,000
But the strangest part is the flashlight.

417
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,900
Could it be that...

418
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,500
How's the investigation going, Shiratori-kun?

419
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,400
We've identified all the people for gunshot residues.

420
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
But there is no reaction.

421
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,500
No reaction?

422
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm afraid the murderer had run away
before we blocked entrances and exits.

423
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,100
Is there any fingerprint on the pistol?

424
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,600
No fingerprints either.

425
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,000
Chiba-kun, the switchboard was rigged, right?

426
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,900
Yes, it was.

427
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,600
It's probably a device that can be detonated by cell phone.

428
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,500
I have been feeling like something's wrong.

429
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Did Officer Sato

430
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,700
hold the flashlight in the toilet from the beginning?

431
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,800
I don't think so.

432
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,100
The locker under the toilet table was open, right?

433
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,200
Maybe the flashlight was originally put there.

434
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,900
And the light was on.

435
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,700
What? So the murderer...

436
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I see.

437
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
No one would have noticed when the light was on.

438
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,400
Looks like this incident is related to that case.

439
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,400
What case?

440
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Well...

441
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,000
Why don't you just tell me?

442
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Ran was almost shot, wasn't she?

443
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,100
Inspector Megure!

444
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,200
Something went wrong! Ran...

445
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
What's wrong with Ran?

446
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,300
Although she's awake, she looks kind of weird.

447
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,500
What?

448
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Ran-nee-chan!

449
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Are you okay, Ran-nee-chan?

450
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
Who are you, kid?

451
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Not only does she not remember us,

452
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,400
she can't even remember her own name.

453
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,300
Impossible.

454
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,100
I'm your father, Kogoro Mouri.

455
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
She's your mother, Eri Kisaki.

456
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,300
I don't remember. I can't remember anything.

457
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,900
Ran.

458
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,900
Dr. Kazato.

459
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,300
I'm sorry to call you over here at this hour.

460
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,000
The doctor on duty at the department of cardiology is not here.

461
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,000
Do you know who you are?

462
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,900
Do you remember what happened today?

463
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,600
No.

464
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,900
Where is the capital of the United States?

465
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Washington, D.C.

466
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,100
What is 5 times 8?

467
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,200
40.

468
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,100
Please press out the refill of this ballpoint pen.

469
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,300
Retrograde amnesia?

470
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
Yes.

471
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,900
This is a memory disorder caused by sudden illness or trauma

472
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,300
that results in the loss of access to
events and information of the past.

473
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,600
But in the case of your daughter,

474
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,200
I'm afraid it's due to the psychological shock

475
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,600
after seeing Officer Sato getting shot.

476
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,500
Then, will my daughter's memory come back?

477
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,400
I can't say for sure at this point.

478
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,900
But I think this won't affect her daily life.

479
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,100
Are you saying that she can still live her life as usual?

480
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,300
Yes.

481
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,000
But, anyway, I think it's better to stay
in the hospital for a few days for observation.

482
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Indeed, it's natural that Ran would be shocked

483
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,000
after seeing an officer she knows getting shot.

484
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,100
But there should be another reason

485
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,800
for the memory loss.

486
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
There must be something that made Ran heartbroken.

487
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,300
Officer Sato's operation has been done.

488
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,200
Finally, that bullet has been removed.

489
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,700
As for whether she can survive, it depends on luck.

490
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,900
Is that so?

491
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Inspector Megure!

492
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,900
Things have become this terrible. Why can't you just tell me?

493
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,500
Shiratori, you must know. Tell me!

494
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,700
I promise we will bring the murderer to justice.

495
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,700
Damn it!

496
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,900
Officer Chiba.

497
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,500
Did you check the fingerprints on the flashlight in the toilet?

498
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,700
Yes.

499
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,500
But we only found Ran-san's fingerprints.

500
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,700
We thought it was Officer Sato who held the flashlight.

501
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,900
But it was Ran-san, in fact.

502
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,800
If that's true, Ran must think that
she was responsible for Officer Sato's incident.

503
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,600
So Ran-kun was stimulated and lost her memory because of this.

504
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Ran.

505
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Even if you can't regain your memory for the rest of your life,

506
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,800
I will always

507
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,800
be your friend.

508
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,700
I'll speak out everything.

509
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,600
But Inspector Megure, it's inappropriate, isn't it?

510
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
What's the big deal?

511
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,300
If I'm fired, I'll open a detective agency just like Mouri-kun.

512
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,100
Inspector Megure...

513
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,100
Takagi-kun, you're in charge of protecting Officer Sato.

514
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,200
Chiba-kun, you go take care of Ran-kun.

515
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,500
If there is any problem, report to me.

516
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,200
Yes, sir.

517
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,800
Last summer.

518
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Dr. Tomatsu Jinno, the first surgeon of
the Touto University Hospital,

519
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,400
was found dead in his apartment.

520
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
The police officer in charge of this case
at that time was my senior,

521
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,040
Officer Tomonari, who was working with me

522
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,770
in the Research Division of the Metropolitan Police Department.

523
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,200
The officers who worked for him at the time were

524
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Officer Narasawa and Officer Shiba, who were both shot dead,

525
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,400
and Officer Sato.

526
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,200
Dr. Jinno had been drinking too much alcohol.

527
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,700
He took his own scalpel

528
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,200
and cut his right carotid artery.

529
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
At last, he died of blood loss.

530
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,700
The first person to find the body

531
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,100
was his sister, Tamaki Jinno, a correspondent
who lived next door to him.

532
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,600
Uncle Mouri, this woman...

533
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
She was at the party at the hotel.

534
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
I remember now.

535
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,800
She came to find me a while ago.

536
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
What? She came to the agency?

537
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,100
What did she want with you?

538
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,200
Well, I was drunk at that time.

539
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,400
So I don't remember what she said.

540
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
But I do remember the murder case of this Dr. Jinno.

541
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Just a few days before he died,

542
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,500
he was sued by the patient's family for surgical errors, right?

543
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,700
Right.

544
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,800
There was also an apology letter for his surgical errors

545
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,300
found in the computer in his room.

546
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,300
So the police thought there was a high probability
that Dr. Jinno committed suicide.

547
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,700
But his sister didn't think he committed suicide.

548
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,100
She said her brother was a feckless doctor
who didn't care about his patients' lives at all.

549
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,400
The idea that he would commit suicide for surgical errors

550
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,900
was complete nonsense for her.

551
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
About one week before the incident,

552
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,400
just in front of a warehouse, she saw Dr. Jinno

553
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,800
having an argument with a young man with dyed purple hair.

554
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,000
A man with dyed purple hair?

555
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,300
Considering the possibility of danger, Officer Tomonari

556
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,200
took Officer Sato, Officer Narasawa and Officer Shiba
to the warehouse together.

557
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
It was a very hot day.

558
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,900
It is said the temperature was even over 35 degrees.

559
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,300
The door was locked.

560
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
Okay, let's stay put for now.

561
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,900
Shiba-kun, you go across the street to monitor.

562
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,500
Yes, sir.

563
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,700
Why is it so hot?

564
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,100
What happened to you?

565
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,700
Chief!

566
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,400
He's having a heart attack.

567
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,100
Call an ambulance!

568
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,700
Got it.

569
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,400
Don't call.

570
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,000
We're monitoring him now.

571
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,300
But...

572
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
I can handle it.

573
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,000
I'll call a taxi to the hospital myself.

574
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,200
You guys keep watching.

575
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Sato-kun was worried, so she went after him later.

576
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Chief Tomonari!

577
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,800
So Sato-kun immediately took Officer Tomonari

578
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,500
to the Touto University Hospital,

579
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,500
but he breathed his last breath in surgery.

580
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,600
Why isn't Officer Sato back yet?

581
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Someone's coming.

582
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,800
I've had enough.

583
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,500
It's too hot today.

584
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Let's roll.

585
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,900
Wait, don't you know who he is?

586
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,400
He's Director Odagiri's son, Toshiya-san.

587
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
In the end, Officer Tomonari died.

588
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,700
Dr. Jinno's death was ruled a suicide.

589
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,000
The investigation ended here.

590
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,900
The police also investigated the relationship
between his sister Tamakii and Toshiya.

591
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,600
But Officer Shiba said she was not involved in the case.

592
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,200
So that's what this is about.

593
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,100
But Officer Tomonari...

594
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,800
He has an only boy named Makoto.

595
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
He was at the party too.

596
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
What?

597
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,700
But he was gone in the blink of an eye.

598
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,200
Is there anything wrong with this guy?

599
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,300
They said that night when at the wake...

600
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,000
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

601
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,100
If you had called an ambulance, my father could have been alive.

602
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,900
But, Chief...

603
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,000
It's you who got my father killed!

604
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,800
I will never forgive you!

605
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Conan-kun, here.

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you.

607
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,700
Not long after that, Officer Narasawa
and Officer Shiba were transferred.

608
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
Until recently, Shiratori found out that

609
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,200
Sato-kun was investigating something when not on duty.

610
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,300
Officer Narasawa asked her to join him and Officer Shiba

611
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,100
to re-investigate the case from a year ago.

612
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
But Sato-san didn't know

613
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Toshiya-kun's relationship with Dr. Jinno.

614
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,100
Officer Narasawa was shot dead

615
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,000
just shortly after he started this investigation.

616
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,500
Then Officer Shiba was shot dead again.

617
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,700
After that, we realized that
it was related to the case a year ago.

618
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,900
Judging from the police manual,

619
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,900
the murderer should be someone related to the police force.

620
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Takagi started investigating Makoto Tomonari,
the son of our chief.

621
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,400
I'm in charge of investigating Toshiya-kun,
the son of the director.

622
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,600
I thought there was a possibility
that the murderer would attack Sato-kun.

623
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,900
So I tried to send a man to protect her.

624
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,300
But she declined my help.

625
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,900
So, that's why you found her at the party.

626
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,900
Right.

627
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I figure it out, Inspector Megure.

628
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,500
The murderer is Toshiya Odagiri.

629
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,100
Because the three officers, Narasawa, Shiba and Sato,

630
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,500
started re-investigating the case from a year ago,

631
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,400
so he struck first.

632
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,400
But he didn't shot Sato-kun.

633
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,900
He didn't test positive for gunshot residues.

634
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,900
All right, you have a point.

635
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,400
But that Makoto Tomonari

636
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,900
are still nowhere to be found.

637
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,900
The day Officer Narasawa and Officer Shiba were shot,

638
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,700
he was seen wandering around the scene.

639
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,300
And today, he was at the party again.

640
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,500
All we know is that the murderer is left-handed.

641
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,000
Oh, right. Makoto Tomonari is left-handed!

642
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,900
All right, arrest Makoto Tomonari immediately!

643
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,400
Yes, sir.

644
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,000
Inspector Megure.

645
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,300
How was Dr. Jinno's carotid artery cut?

646
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,100
How was it cut?

647
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,800
It was cut straight down from the top right to the bottom left.

648
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,800
If this is a homicide case,

649
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
the murderer might be left-handed too.

650
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,000
How do you know that?

651
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,000
Because...

652
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,100
This is to avoid spraying blood on the body.

653
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,700
In that case,

654
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,200
The murderer can't cut the right carotid artery
without using his left hand.

655
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,700
Right, Conan-kun?

656
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,200
I see, but

657
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,900
Makoto Tomonari has nothing to do with Dr. Jinno.

658
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,600
Even if the case of Dr. Jinno is a homicide case,

659
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,000
the left-handed murderer could have been someone else.

660
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,300
Toshiya-san is left-handed too.

661
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,500
He used his left hand to light the match.

662
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,400
There was another person.

663
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,800
His father, Director Odagiri.

664
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,800
He was also left-handed.

665
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,800
Nonsense! How could the director be the murderer?

666
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,200
Inspector Megure.

667
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:19,600
(Beika Yakushi Hospital)

668
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,200
I'm Ayumi Yoshida.

669
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,500
This is Genta Kojima, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya.

670
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,600
This is Ai Haibara.

671
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,400
We are all friends of Conan-kun.

672
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,900
We are here to see you, Ran onee-san.

673
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,500
Thank you.

674
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,500
But I'm sorry.

675
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I don't remember anyone.

676
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,100
How come? I don't believe it.

677
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,500
We used to play together before.

678
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,200
Don't you remember me too?

679
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm Professor Agasa.

680
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,700
I am the genius scientist
who lives next door to your childhood friend,

681
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,400
Shinichi Kudo.

682
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,600
Shinichi Kudo?

683
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,000
Do you remember about Shinichi-ni-chan?

684
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,200
No, I don't.

685
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,200
Is that so?

686
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,100
What's wrong, Haibara?

687
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,400
It seems that someone has been watching us.

688
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I guess I'm just being paranoid.

689
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,300
I'm sorry, I'm a little tired.

690
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,200
It's okay, you should get some rest.

691
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,000
Who is it?

692
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,800
Damn it!

693
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,300
What's wrong Conan?

694
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,100
Uncle Mouri, is it possible
that Ran-nee-chan saw the murder's face

695
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,800
when Officer Sato got shot?

696
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,500
What?

697
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,800
If so,

698
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,300
the murderer may come to kill Ran-nee-chan!

699
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
You're finally here.

700
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,400
No need to worry.

701
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,600
Takagi-kun and Chiba-kun will take turns to watch over her.

702
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,400
What's the situation now?

703
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,400
Kogoro is staying with her.

704
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,300
Okay, let's go.

705
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,900
Kisaki-san.

706
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,400
What is it?

707
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,800
Dr. Kazato wants to talk to you about your daughter's condition.

708
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,600
According to the results of the MRI,

709
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,700
there was no brain damage found.

710
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,600
It seems that your daughter lost her memory

711
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,200
because she's trying to avoid the mental trauma.

712
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,500
Are you saying that

713
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,200
if I take my daughter to that hotel

714
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,300
to reenact the scene once, her memory will come back?

715
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,100
What are you talking about?

716
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,300
If she doesn't want to remember,
then you shouldn't force her to remember.

717
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,500
What?

718
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Do you want Ran to lose her memory forever?

719
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,900
I will never make her suffer.

720
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,600
If we force her to remember,

721
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm afraid it will cause damage to her brain.

722
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
I told you.

723
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,100
Excuse me.

724
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,500
Hello, this is Kazato.

725
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,500
Okay, I know. I'll make a call.

726
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,900
If Ran really saw the murder's face,

727
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
she must regain her memory
and identify the murder as soon as possible,

728
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,600
or she may be killed by the murder at any time.

729
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,300
But as the doctor said,

730
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,800
we can't force her to remember.

731
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,500
Then it's up to me to protect Ran.

732
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,300
Strange, nobody is answering.

733
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,900
I'm sorry for that.

734
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
Doctor.

735
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,800
Is there any way to bring back her memory naturally?

736
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Generally speaking, in a relaxed state,

737
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
sometimes the patient's memory will come back all of a sudden.

738
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,300
I see.

739
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,700
I'll move in with you when Ran gets out of the hospital.

740
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,700
What?

741
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,400
That way, I can take care of Ran.

742
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,500
Ran will be more relaxed.

743
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,000
Are you kidding? I'll be more stressed, okay?

744
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,600
What you're gonna be is none of my business.

745
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,200
It's all for Ran.

746
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,200
You won't object, will you?

747
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Oh, I'm screwed.

748
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,100
(Beika Yakushi Hospital)
(Two days later)

749
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,400
Ran-san, try not to force yourself to recall.

750
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You understand?

751
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,300
Yes.

752
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,400
If you remember anything, please contact me.

753
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,900
I will.

754
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,100
Since you were born,

755
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
You've lived in this city for 17 years.

756
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,500
Do you remember anything?

757
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,500
This is your home.

758
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,200
Mouri Detective Agency?

759
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,400
Don't get wet.

760
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,100
What's wrong, Ran?

761
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Maybe she's afraid of puddles.

762
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,600
When Officer Sato got shot,
there was a puddle of water in the toilet too.

763
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,300
Please move the car forward a bit.

764
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,400
Okay.

765
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,500
This is my office on the second floor.

766
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,100
I always work on big cases at that desk.

767
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,500
I'm afraid you just drink beer
and watch TV at that desk every day.

768
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,300
On the third floor, this is the living room.
And this is the kitchen.

769
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,300
This is your room.

770
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,200
This brat is Shinichi Kudo.

771
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,000
He is that bastard who used
some kind of dirty trick to bewitch you.

772
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,500
Who used dirty trick to bewitch her?

773
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
Ran-nee-chan, you know karate too.

774
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
I know karate.

775
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,800
You even won a provincial high school competition.

776
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,000
Remember?

777
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,300
No.

778
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,300
Okay.

779
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,200
But don't worry.

780
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,200
I'll remember soon.

781
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,100
That's right. Anyway, you finally got out of the hospital,

782
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,800
we should have a big dinner tonight.

783
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,400
Then I guess I'll have to show off
my excellent cooking skills this time.

784
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,700
What's wrong with you two?

785
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,700
Well, your cooking...

786
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,300
You don't have to bother cooking for me.

787
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,700
I'm not really hungry.

788
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,500
You're being too polite, Conan-kun.

789
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,100
I promise you I'll do my best

790
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,900
to make the most delicious beef broth ever.

791
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,900
That's what I'm afraid of.

792
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,900
Honey, where are you going?

793
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,000
Nothing.

794
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,600
I forgot that my neighbor is waiting for me
to play mahjong tonight.

795
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,000
Our daughter is sick like this.

796
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,500
How can you go play mahjong at this point?

797
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,200
Are you suggesting that

798
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,000
my cooking is unpalatable to you?

799
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,200
Great.

800
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,300
Ran is livelier than I thought.

801
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,000
She should be fine.

802
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,500
Ran.

803
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,900
You want to be my bodyguards?

804
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,100
Officer Takagi said that the murderer might hurt you.

805
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,800
We, Detective Boys,

806
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,000
have decided to protect your safety.

807
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,800
Now our team name is changed to

808
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,700
"Ran-nee-chan's Guards".

809
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I have a pepper spray gun with me.

810
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,900
I have a boomerang.

811
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,900
I have handcuffs.

812
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,800
Come on, that's all kid stuff.

813
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,500
Thank you.

814
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,200
I feel so much more safe.

815
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,100
Let me buy you some drinks as a thank you.

816
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,000
Let's go upstairs.

817
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Okay!

818
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,400
Great!

819
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,200
She still doesn't remember anything?

820
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
No.

821
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,800
Wouldn't it be better for you

822
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,100
if she just lost her memory of the past forever?

823
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,500
You would no longer worry that you might be exposed.

824
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,100
How can you say that?

825
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,600
If it were me...

826
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,300
If it were me...

827
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,600
I'd rather forget the past, if I could.

828
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:52,800
Including my sister's murder and the fact that
I was an organization member who made poison.

829
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,000
If I could forget all this,

830
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,800
and live the rest of my life as this pupil named Ai Haibara,
I would definitely be very happy.

831
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,900
Then,

832
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,500
I could be with you forever...

833
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,000
Forever.

834
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,900
Haibara, you...

835
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm just kidding. You're now in your right mind?

836
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,200
Hi, kid.

837
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,400
Is this your new girlfriend?

838
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,700
Now the nagging witch shows up again.

839
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,200
This is a picture of you winning the karate competition.

840
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,100
Do you remember?

841
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,300
This person...

842
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,700
You mean Kudo?

843
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,900
He's your husband.

844
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,800
Who are you calling husband?

845
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,600
She seems to remember.

846
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,000
Really, Ran-nee-chan?

847
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,200
No.

848
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,900
But...

849
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:58,600
But?

850
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,700
Somehow, I kind of feel like I'm missing him.

851
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,400
I don't know why.

852
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,700
You might remember if you see Shinichi-san.

853
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,400
That's right! You should bring him here!

854
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,900
If I could have found him,
I would have brought him here long ago.

855
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,500
By the way, that high school detective

856
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,200
is working on the most difficult cases nationwide, right?

857
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,600
That bastard!

858
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,100
Ran is suffering now. Where the hell is he?

859
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,200
Come in.

860
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,300
Ran-nee-chan, I've run a bath for you.

861
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
Thank you.

862
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,700
Conan-kun.

863
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,500
What kind of person is Shinichi Kudo?

864
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,400
What kind of person?

865
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,600
I guess

866
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,700
he is the kind of person who always puts you first

867
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,500
but doesn't know how to directly express his feelings.

868
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,700
I really want to see him.

869
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,900
Ran, do you want to go to Ginza tomorrow?

870
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,000
I can't help getting mad when I see that old bastard.

871
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Let's go shopping for clothes and relax.

872
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,800
Will you join us, Conan-kun?

873
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,500
Okay.

874
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
Are you okay?

875
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Officer Sato!

876
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,900
Officer Sato! Hang in there!

877
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,600
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.

878
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,100
Damn it!

879
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,500
The tram is coming!

880
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,900
Ran!

881
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,500
Ran!

882
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
(Beika Yakushi Hospital)

883
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,100
Ran!

884
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,700
She just fell asleep on sedatives.

885
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,300
Is Ran okay?

886
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,700
Luckily, she only got some scratches.

887
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,000
But after this incident,

888
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm afraid it will affect the recovery of her memory.

889
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,800
Takagi, wasn't you supposed to watch over her?

890
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm so sorry!

891
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,800
But now things are clear.

892
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,900
The moment Sato-kun got shot,

893
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,000
Ran-kun must have seen the murderer's face.

894
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,100
Listen, no matter what happen, you must protect Ran-kun.

895
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:13,800
Yes, sir!

896
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,900
It's not enough just to protect her.

897
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,100
We must strike first.

898
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,360
(Beika Sun Plaza Hotel)

899
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,800
All the people who were in the hotel at that time
test positive for gunshot residues.

900
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,500
Is it really impossible to fire a gun

901
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,100
without leaving gunshot residue particles?

902
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,900
Wait a minute.

903
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,100
I remember

904
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,300
the umbrella stand was locked at that time.

905
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,100
After the crime,

906
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,800
the umbrella stand was open,

907
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,400
and the umbrella was not in its original place.

908
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,600
Plus Ran's reaction when she left the hospital.

909
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Could it be...

910
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,400
What? That's your umbrella?

911
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Do you know where it is now?

912
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,100
I'm sorry.

913
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,500
It had a hole in it, so I just threw it away.

914
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,600
Not surprising. After all, it's been so long.

915
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm just kidding. I kept it for you.

916
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,400
That's funny.

917
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,700
Thank you.

918
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,400
I'm right.

919
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,100
I finally figured out

920
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,400
the way to shoot without leaving gunshot residues.

921
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,730
Now, in addition to Makoto Tomonari,

922
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,800
the murderer could also be Tamaki Jinno and Toshiya-san.

923
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,700
No, everyone at the party could be a possible suspect.

924
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,200
Found it.

925
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,800
I see.

926
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Tamaki-san went to the party

927
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,700
Because she was following Toshiya-san.

928
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
Damn bitch!

929
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,300
Why do you follow me every day?

930
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
Do you care?

931
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,400
What?

932
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,700
I'll find evidence for the two officers you shot

933
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,500
to prove that you're the killer!

934
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,400
Are you trying to use yourself as bait?

935
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,900
You're Dr. Jinno's sister, Tamaki-san, right?

936
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,600
The man who had an argument with your brother a year ago

937
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,400
is Toshiya Odagiri.

938
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,300
You must have found out that because his father was the director,

939
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,700
he didn't even need to give a statement, right?

940
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,300
Who are you, kid?

941
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,400
Conan Edogawa.

942
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
A detective.

943
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,900
Detective?

944
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,300
If you really love your brother that much,

945
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:52,000
naturally, you must hate the three officers

946
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,700
who closed your brother's case with suicide.

947
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,400
I hate my brother.

948
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,900
The only reason I'm investigating this case

949
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,700
is to find out the truth.

950
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,400
Then why don't you take a risk
to sneak into the enemy's base camp.

951
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,480
(House of Director Odagiri)

952
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,400
He's using iaido to test the sword?

953
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,700
Impressive.

954
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,300
You're Tamaki Jinno, right?

955
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,600
I have something for you.

956
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,100
Something for me?

957
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,900
One month ago,

958
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,400
I found this in my son, Toshiya's room.

959
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,700
T.JINNO.

960
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,800
This is my brother's thing.

961
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,200
Yes.

962
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,400
One year ago, Officer Tomonari died suddenly of a heart attack.

963
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,200
This was the last case he worked on.

964
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,400
That's why I remembered this name.

965
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,400
I asked Toshiya about it.

966
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,800
He told me he learned that Dr. Jinno was selling forbidden drugs,

967
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,600
so he took this opportunity to extort hush money from him.

968
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,400
But there was no mention of Toshiya's name

969
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,900
in the investigation report at that time.

970
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,400
So I ordered Officer Narasawa to re-investigate this case.

971
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,900
So the person who ordered him to re-investigate
was you, Director Odagiri?

972
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,000
Since Officer Narasawa was shot dead,

973
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,200
Inspector Megure has taken over this case.

974
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,800
But if it was Officer Narasawa
who first proposed to reopen this case,

975
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,700
perhaps you'd try to stop him from investigating your own son.

976
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,500
I do have motive to kill them three.

977
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,400
If you really want the truth to come out,

978
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,800
show me the investigation report.

979
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,600
That's impossible.

980
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Letting the truth come out

981
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,100
is police work.

982
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,400
Thank god! You didn't get hurt.

983
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,500
Thank you.

984
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,200
The doctor also said I can be discharged from the hospital now.

985
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,900
Sonoko-san.

986
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,400
Just call me Sonoko!

987
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,300
What kind of kid is Conan-kun?

988
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,400
Why would he risk his life to save me?

989
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,400
For a kid, he does seem a little too resourceful.

990
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,000
He also has a keen sense of the situation. He's great anyway.

991
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,100
But if you ask my opinion,

992
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,600
I'd say that he's just an arrogant kid.

993
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:43,900
Is that so?

994
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,400
In this year's Tropical Land,

995
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,000
there will be a new area named "Pangea Wild Island".

996
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,700
I believe it'll bring more fun to you.

997
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,400
I know that place.

998
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,600
You mean this Tropical Land?

999
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,900
Oh right, you used to go there with Shinichi-kun.

1000
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,000
I see.

1001
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,000
Ran-san's memory is much better than before.

1002
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Doctor.

1003
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,600
If she goes to the Tropical Land,

1004
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,400
will her memory come back?

1005
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,300
It's possible.

1006
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,400
I'll go there tomorrow and see if there will be any change.

1007
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,800
Wait, I object.

1008
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,800
The murderer might try to hurt you again.

1009
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,500
Indeed, it's painful for me to recall that case.

1010
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,400
To be honest, I'm also afraid to think about it.

1011
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,500
But I can't go on like this.

1012
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,300
I have to take the first step.

1013
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,400
Ran.

1014
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,200
Ran-san, you're so brave.

1015
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,700
With this thought, I believe you'll be fine in the Tropical Land.

1016
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,700
Then how about we go there the day after tomorrow.

1017
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,500
I won't be available tomorrow.

1018
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,700
Don't worry, I'll be with our daughter.

1019
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,600
I will protect Ran well, even if I die!

1020
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,900
Dear...

1021
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,100
Ran, I'll go with you too.

1022
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,300
Thank you.

1023
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,000
But, don't let Conan-kun know about this.

1024
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,100
If he knew, he'd definitely go with us.

1025
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,500
I don't want to put him in danger again.

1026
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,700
I see.

1027
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,900
I didn't expect it to be so late.

1028
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,800
Conan-kun, if you want to see the investigation report,

1029
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,400
I have a copy.

1030
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
Really?

1031
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,700
I'm a journalist after all.

1032
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
That copy is in my apartment. I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

1033
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,200
Okay.

1034
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,800
I'm leaving.

1035
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,800
He's gone.

1036
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,200
He didn't notice anything wrong.

1037
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,500
Then we should get going too.

1038
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,400
Great! Ran-nee-san is out!

1039
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,400
After waiting all morning, we didn't waste our time.

1040
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,300
Don't we inform Edogawa-kun?

1041
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,700
It's okay not to tell him just this once.
He was ahead of us every time.

1042
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,900
Let me be clear, don't take any risks.

1043
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,200
Follow the car in front.

1044
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,700
Did you find out anything, little detective?

1045
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,200
The manual that Officer Shiba was holding...

1046
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,000
What's wrong with that manual?

1047
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,900
If the manual was taken out of his breast pocket,

1048
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,700
the direction of the manual should be reversed, shouldn't it

1049
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,700
If he took it out of the pocket...

1050
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,600
Indeed.

1051
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,100
Maybe

1052
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:14,200
the person who pulled out the manual
wasn't Officer Shiba, but the murderer.

1053
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,100
I see. It's possible.

1054
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,300
I'll find the evidence.

1055
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,100
Aren't you right-handed, Tamaki-san?

1056
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,300
I was left-handed before I changed to right-handed.

1057
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,800
So when I think about other things,

1058
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,700
I will unconsciously use my left hand to smoke.

1059
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Unconsciously?

1060
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,400
Come to think of it, at that time...

1061
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,200
Wait a minute.

1062
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,700
That... That means...

1063
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,500
Could it be...

1064
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,300
That's what he meant!

1065
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,700
The hospital where your brother used to work

1066
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,900
is the Touto University Hospital, right?

1067
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,300
Right. Sorry, Conan-kun.

1068
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,600
I've got to go.

1069
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,100
Maybe we should call it a day.

1070
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,200
Bye, Conan-kun.

1071
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,500
Take me to the Tropical Land.

1072
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,400
Yes!

1073
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,200
I remember this place.

1074
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,600
I remember when Shinichi came here with you,

1075
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:51,200
we solved the Roller Coaster Murder Case.

1076
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,900
Let's try this roller coaster too.

1077
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,200
Maybe you'll remember more.

1078
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,000
The Mystery Roller Coaster

1079
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
is on the Magical Fantasy Island nearby.

1080
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,500
Ran and Sonoko, you two sit in the front.

1081
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,600
You know what?

1082
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,500
I'm sure Conan Doyle will say that.

1083
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,600
It's nothing

1084
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,600
Ran onee-san and the others are over there.

1085
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,100
I want to play too.

1086
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,600
What are you saying?

1087
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,300
We should check around to see
if there are any suspicious people nearby.

1088
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,300
Let's go.

1089
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,300
Okay.

1090
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,200
Strange. Isn't Mouri-kun afraid of heights?

1091
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,500
I'm dying!

1092
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,600
Well, are you all right?

1093
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,500
Ran, do you want a Coke?

1094
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,100
Yeah.

1095
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,000
Baby bear balloons!

1096
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,700
Who on earth invented that stupid thing?

1097
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,500
Take it, you must be thirsty.

1098
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,900
Here's your Coke.

1099
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,700
Thank you.

1100
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,900
Are you Shinichi Kudo?

1101
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,900
But I still don't remember who you are.

1102
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,300
Mouri-san, I gotta go to the bathroom.

1103
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,100
Thank you!

1104
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,400
The balloons flew away.

1105
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,200
Ran-san, dangerous!

1106
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,400
Stop!

1107
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,500
Hey, don't go!

1108
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,700
I won't let you run away!

1109
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
Take that! My pepper spray gun!

1110
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,000
Makoto Tomonari! It's you!

1111
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,700
What did you take?

1112
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,900
A knife?

1113
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,000
Makoto Tomonari! You're under arrest for attempted murder!

1114
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,800
Great!

1115
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,200
Ran-nee-chan's Guards!

1116
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,000
Great victory!

1117
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,100
Mouri-san!

1118
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,400
I'll take him straight back to the police station.

1119
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,200
Wait, I'll go with you!

1120
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,200
Great!

1121
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,100
No one will hurt you anymore.

1122
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,100
Without me here, you'll think about Shinichi more often, right?

1123
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,500
Dad...

1124
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,700
It's okay.

1125
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,300
You can wait until you remember it all before calling me that.

1126
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,700
Thanks to the Detective Boys, Ran is fine.

1127
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,000
You kids did a great job.

1128
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,700
He said we did a great job.

1129
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,400
We were complimented

1130
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,900
by the famous detective.

1131
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,400
Okay! We can have fun now!

1132
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,000
I want to see the parade!

1133
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,400
Can we play into the night, Professor?

1134
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,200
Okay.

1135
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,600
Shinichi and Ran-kun also played into the night at that time.

1136
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,500
Great!

1137
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,900
Is this really over?

1138
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,200
Ran, let's go to the Devil's Laboratory!

1139
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,900
It's fun!

1140
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,900
(Touto University Hospital)
Kid, you are the assistant

1141
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,900
of that famous detective Kogoro Mouri, right?

1142
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,300
If I help you,

1143
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,400
will you get Mouri-san's autograph for me?

1144
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,700
And me.

1145
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,400
No problem.

1146
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,400
How hard can it be? Uncle Mouri's autographs
are more than you can imagine.

1147
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,100
Speaking of Dr. Jinno,

1148
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,500
all I know is he was a nasty doctor.

1149
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,700
That's right.

1150
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,500
He only cared about embezzling money, not practicing medicine.

1151
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,700
He often made errors while performing surgeries.

1152
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,400
Do you remember?

1153
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,100
Once, while dealing with a patient having a heart attack,

1154
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:14,200
he even slashed the wrist of the doctor
who was performing the surgery together.

1155
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,500
Right, right.

1156
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,300
And he got that patient killed.

1157
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,200
Can you tell me more about it?

1158
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,100
Just as I expected.

1159
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,200
I gotta inform Uncle Mouri as soon as possible.

1160
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,400
Hello, this is Mouri Detective Agency.

1161
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,900
The famous detective Kogoro Mouri is busy working on a big case.

1162
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,900
Damn it!

1163
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,800
Hello, this is Kisaki Law Office.

1164
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,700
It's Conan

1165
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,300
Conan-kun?

1166
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,900
Is Miss Kisaki here?

1167
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,500
Miss Kisaki just got out of court.
She's already on her way to Tropical Land.

1168
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,500
Tropical Land?

1169
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,600
I heard that Ran-san is there.

1170
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,700
No!

1171
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,300
It's a ghost!

1172
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:53,900
(Metropolitan Police Department)

1173
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,500
Alright? Can you talk now?

1174
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,800
I got a call from a man.

1175
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,800
He said he'd tell me the truth about my father's death.

1176
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,300
So I waited for him at the traffic light
in Beika Town as he asked.

1177
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,000
But that man didn't show up,

1178
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,900
and Officer Narasawa got killed nearby.

1179
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,200
When I got home,

1180
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,700
I got another call from that man.

1181
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,300
He asked me to go to the Midoridai Park Building.

1182
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,500
The man still didn't show up.

1183
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,700
But in the parking lot near the building,

1184
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,100
Officer Shiba was found shot dead.

1185
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,300
That's when I realized

1186
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,200
I was set up by the murderer.

1187
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,100
I had to stay at a commercial hotel that night.

1188
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,800
The next day, I called home to check my voice mail.

1189
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,300
I found a woman who called herself Officer Sato

1190
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,800
asked me to meet her at the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel.

1191
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,900
She said that if I didn't go,
I would be arrested on suspicion of murder.

1192
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,300
When I went there, I realized that
there were police officers everywhere,

1193
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,600
so I left immediately.

1194
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,600
But, I never thought Officer Sato would also...

1195
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,500
Why didn't you call the police right away?

1196
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,800
After my father's incident, how can I possibly trust the police?

1197
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,000
Then I wanted to ask Detective Mouri for help.

1198
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That's why I wandered around his house.

1199
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,500
So you weren't trying to get close to Ran-kun at Tropical Land?

1200
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Yes.

1201
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,100
I just wanted to talk to Mouri-san.

1202
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,300
Wait, how do you explain your knife?

1203
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:39,500
It was for protecting myself.
I was afraid the murderer would hurt me.

1204
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,400
So, the murderer is someone else?

1205
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,500
And there is a female accomplice.

1206
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,700
Ran is in danger...

1207
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,800
(Ice Mist Maze)

1208
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,500
This spot should work.

1209
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,500
Is the observation deck vacant now?

1210
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,000
Yes, because everyone is watching the parade outside.

1211
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,800
Thank you.

1212
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,200
Welcome to the Ice Mist Maze.

1213
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,600
Where are you, Ran? Where are you?

1214
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,800
Genta and the other kids? They're here too?

1215
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,300
Then Ran must be around.

1216
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,100
It's him!

1217
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,400
Ran!

1218
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,700
Right, the Detective Boys Badge!

1219
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,100
Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi!

1220
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,300
Can you hear me? Answer me!

1221
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,100
Conan-kun, I can hear you.

1222
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,500
Conan, guess where we are.

1223
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,600
Don't be shocked when I tell you.

1224
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
We're in Tropical Land.

1225
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,000
You guys, calm down and listen to me.

1226
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,900
Now the murderer is aiming a pistol at Ran.

1227
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:29,900
What?

1228
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,800
Anyway, you must try to walk in the crowd,

1229
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,200
and get Ran out of Tropical Land!

1230
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,000
Hey, are you listening?

1231
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,400
Ran onee-san, run!

1232
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,000
A gun is aimed at you!

1233
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,700
Dangerous!

1234
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Professor!

1235
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,400
It's me... I put the people around me in danger.

1236
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,300
Don't leave, Ran-kun.

1237
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,500
Don't be alone. That's exactly what the murder wants.

1238
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,400
Ran-kun! Ran-kun!

1239
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,500
Damn it!

1240
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,100
Ran is in the "Fairy Tale Island" nearby.

1241
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,800
If I want to go there...

1242
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,800
Please get aboard.

1243
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Hey, kid!

1244
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,400
Over there!

1245
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,500
Conan-kun?

1246
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,700
It's alright now, Ran-nee-chan.

1247
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,900
Let's blend in with the crowd and go out.

1248
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,800
This way!

1249
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,300
Shit!

1250
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,000
To kill Ran, he has completely disregarded the other people now.

1251
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:23,100
(Pangea Wild Island)

1252
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,100
Help! There's a strange man here!

1253
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,900
Get on the boat!

1254
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,500
You two!

1255
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,700
Conan-kun, where did you learn how to drive the boat?

1256
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,400
My father taught me in Hawaii.

1257
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,200
I think we're safe now, right?

1258
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:57,900
Not yet.

1259
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,300
My Coke...

1260
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,300
Coke?

1261
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,200
20 minutes to 9:00.

1262
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,500
Conan-kun, a waterfall in front!

1263
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,100
Hold on tight!

1264
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,500
Go!

1265
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,400
Almost there. Come on!

1266
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,000
Damn, he's already come.

1267
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,100
Anyway, we gotta climb up and hide behind the rock!

1268
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,200
Hurry up!

1269
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,100
Conan-kun?

1270
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:43,400
This place will be closed at night, no one will come.
You can show your face.

1271
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
You're really cautious.

1272
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,300
But it's no use hiding.

1273
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:55,400
I already know the true meaning of Officer Narasawa's message.

1274
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,500
The purpose of his clutching his left chest before he died

1275
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,600
was not to suggest the police manual,

1276
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,900
but to suggest the heart,

1277
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,700
which means one word of the term "department of cardiology",

1278
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,600
"cardiology".

1279
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,700
Am I right?

1280
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,000
Dr. Kyosuke Kazato.

1281
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,800
When did you know it was me?

1282
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,800
The first time you aroused my suspicion

1283
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
was when you made the call.

1284
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,500
A right-handed person doesn't dial with the left hand.

1285
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,900
So, you're actually left-handed.

1286
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,800
I see. I didn't notice that.

1287
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,600
Seven years ago, you were the youngest top surgeon

1288
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,000
in the Touto University Hospital.

1289
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:55,100
But during an operation with Dr. Jinno,

1290
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,100
Dr. Jinno slashed your left wrist by mistake.

1291
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,800
After that accident,

1292
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,400
you lost the famous "golden left hand" you were most proud of.

1293
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,400
You are a proud person,
so you decided to give up being a surgeon,

1294
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,200
and transferred from department of surgery
to department of cardiology

1295
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,700
Since then, perhaps because of your pride,

1296
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,900
you have stopped using your left hand
and only used your right hand, right?

1297
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,900
You're right.

1298
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,800
I never thought you'd be able to see through me
just by dialing the number.

1299
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,800
After you transferred to Beika Yakushi Hospital

1300
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,400
as a cardiologist,

1301
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,800
you got in touch with Dr. Jinno again one year ago.

1302
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,800
We happened to meet again.

1303
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,700
He invited me to his apartment for a drink.

1304
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,470
Under the influence of alcohol,

1305
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:48,300
I finally asked the question in my mind for the past six years.

1306
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,000
I asked him if that accident was intentional.

1307
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,600
You're too slow to understand, aren't you?

1308
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
As I expected, he had arranged the accident on purpose.

1309
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,800
At that point, I wanted him dead.

1310
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,800
Coincidentally, he was accused of surgical error.

1311
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,800
There was a good reason for him to commit suicide.

1312
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,900
In the end, his death was ruled a suicide, just as I expected.

1313
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:26,300
But you should know that
someone ordered to re-investigate the case.

1314
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,490
I heard about it from Officer Narasawa,

1315
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,000
who was transferred to the Beika Police Station at that time.

1316
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,500
After the death of his colleague, Officer Tomonari,

1317
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,700
he was traumatized and came to consult me.

1318
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:41,800
In the course of my treatment,
I learned that Makoto Tomonari hated the police.

1319
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,100
When you heard that the case would be re-investigated,

1320
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,500
you decided to kill the three police officers

1321
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,300
before the police found you.

1322
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,300
In order to set Makoto Tomonari up to take the fall for you,

1323
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,700
you asked him out to the crime scenes.

1324
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,100
Yes.

1325
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,900
When dealing with Officer Narasawa and Officer Shiba,

1326
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,100
I used my own voice to make the call.

1327
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,800
When dealing with Officer Sato,

1328
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:06,200
you edited the tapes you recorded while treating female patients.

1329
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:06,800
Right?

1330
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,300
Exactly.

1331
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,200
Officer Narasawa was clutching the police manual
on his chest before he died.

1332
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,100
You heard this from Officer Shiratori, right?

1333
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:18,100
That's because I'm his attending physician.

1334
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:23,200
In order to suggest that the murderer is
the son of a police officer, Makoto Tomonari,

1335
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,900
after Officer Shiba fell to the ground,

1336
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,200
you put the police manual into his hand.

1337
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,200
You are really something, Conan-kun.

1338
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,800
Too bad you don't have proof that I'm the murderer.

1339
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,200
Because after Officer Sato got shot,

1340
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,100
I didn't test positive for gunshot residues.

1341
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,600
Speaking of this little trick,

1342
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,100
I'll be glad to explain it to you, if you really want to hear.

1343
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,300
But only after you've been arrested by the police.

1344
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,000
This way.

1345
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,900
He'll be waiting at that exit.

1346
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,240
(Adventure Island)

1347
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,000
This is...

1348
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,100
This is the main island of "Adventure Island".

1349
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,100
There is an underwater tunnel from that island to here.

1350
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,700
Is that so?

1351
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,400
Let's go.

1352
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,900
I haven't finished yet.

1353
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,900
Damn it, did he come after us by boat?

1354
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,800
I'll be totally screwed if you really see through that trick.

1355
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:00,400
I'll be one of the suspects in Officer Sato's murder.

1356
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,400
Even if Ran says that you're the murder,

1357
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,700
you can still use that test to play the innocent.

1358
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,400
You're right.

1359
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,500
Although Ran-kun only took a quick look at me,

1360
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,800
I can't take any chances.

1361
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,000
But I'd like to see if your reasoning is accurate.

1362
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
As you wish.

1363
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,800
At first, you cut off the power supply
on the 15th floor of the hotel.

1364
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,500
Then, you put on your surgical gloves,

1365
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,500
grabbed the umbrella you put in the umbrella stand
and run to the ladies' room.

1366
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,000
The front of the umbrella has a hole that you broke in advance.

1367
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,600
You put the pistol through the hole before shooting.

1368
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:52,400
This way, the umbrella blocked the gunpowder and smoke.

1369
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,900
That's why you didn't test positive
for gunshot residues at that night.

1370
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,900
I believe you've already flushed the gloves down the toilet.

1371
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,900
Exactly correct, Conan-kun.

1372
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,500
Seems like I have no choice but to kill you.

1373
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,900
Conan-kun.

1374
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:29,900
Why?

1375
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,600
Why would you risk your life to protect me?

1376
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,500
Why?

1377
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,100
I like you.

1378
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,700
Because I like you.

1379
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,000
More than anyone else on this planet.

1380
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:55,500
Jump!

1381
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,100
Take a deep breath. Quickly.

1382
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,800
Thank you.

1383
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,600
Little man.

1384
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,400
Damn it!

1385
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:26,560
(Science Island)

1386
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:38,900
46 seconds left.

1387
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,400
He's coming!

1388
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,600
Let's end it here, Conan-kun!

1389
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,100
You have no place to run.

1390
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,600
Conan-kun!

1391
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,600
I'm fine. Just scratched my arm.

1392
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,700
I told you. You have no place to run.

1393
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,200
If you kill Ran here,

1394
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,800
that will prove that Makoto Tomonari is innocent.

1395
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,000
You have a point.

1396
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,500
I was planning to kill him before Makoto Tomonari was arrested.

1397
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,400
Change of plans.

1398
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,900
I think it's better to put ladies first.

1399
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,500
10.

1400
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:28,700
9.

1401
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,000
8.

1402
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,100
7.

1403
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,300
6.

1404
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:33,300
5.

1405
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:33,500
- 5.
- Is this some kind of incantation?

1406
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,200
Is this some kind of incantation?

1407
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:34,800
- 4.
- Is this some kind of incantation?

1408
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:34,900
Is this some kind of incantation?

1409
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,000
3.

1410
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,200
2.

1411
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,500
1.

1412
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,200
Ran-san, put it down!

1413
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,000
Officer Sato!

1414
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,800
Take it, you must be thirsty.

1415
01:30:58,800 --> 01:30:59,700
1!

1416
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,500
Stay away!

1417
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,000
Once the fountain is over, you'll be dead.

1418
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,200
You'd better give up!

1419
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,000
Kid stuff.

1420
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:35,900
There he is.

1421
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:43,600
Go to hell!

1422
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,500
Conan-kun.

1423
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,600
Ran, are you...

1424
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,900
Little brat, I'll kill you first!

1425
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,400
No...no way!

1426
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,700
I remembered everything.

1427
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,900
Including the scene where you shot Officer Sato,

1428
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:28,900
and the fact that I won the karate competition championship!

1429
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,500
Karate?

1430
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,400
Championship?

1431
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,600
Impressive.

1432
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,700
Ran!

1433
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,500
Ran!

1434
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,400
Mom! Dad!

1435
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,900
You...

1436
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,600
Your memory has come back?

1437
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,800
So you remember me too?

1438
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,700
Of course I do.

1439
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:15,400
You're Sonoko Suzuki, my best friend for life.

1440
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,700
Ran!

1441
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,900
Ran! Thank god!

1442
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,200
So this guy is the killer!

1443
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,500
Director Odagiri ordered to re-investigate this case himself.

1444
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,600
He already told us.

1445
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,400
Conan, you are so cunning!

1446
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,300
You always catch the murderer yourself.

1447
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,000
Don't be so childish. It's because he didn't want you in danger.

1448
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,800
But we're a team, aren't we?

1449
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,700
We are all members of the Detective Boys.

1450
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,200
Sorry, sorry.

1451
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,100
Conan-kun, you're bleeding.

1452
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,700
Here.

1453
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:01,500
Everything is fine now. That's great.

1454
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,500
Yes.

1455
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,300
You did an amazing job, great detective.

1456
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,700
What are you doing here, Tamaki-san?

1457
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,600
Toshiya is having a concert here. I'm here to spy on him.

1458
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,600
Looks like I wasted my efforts.

1459
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,300
Then again...

1460
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,600
Who said "I will protect Ran well, even if I die"?

1461
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:26,200
It's Conan-kun and Professor Agasa
who risked their lives to protect Ran, all right?

1462
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,900
Anyway, she's okay now. That's the most important.

1463
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,900
Is this true?

1464
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,700
Yes!

1465
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:39,000
Guys! Officer Sato has been awake!

1466
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,100
No need to worry anymore!

1467
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,900
Really?

1468
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,400
Officer Sato!

1469
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,700
That's great, Takagi-san!

1470
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,900
Great!

1471
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,700
Finally, it ended well.

1472
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,900
What are you talking about?

1473
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,600
There's still a Toshiya's extortion case pending.

1474
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,200
Although the victim is dead,

1475
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,600
we still have to deal with this case seriously.

1476
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,800
Yes, sir!

1477
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,600
It seems that you are still the one...

1478
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,400
who let the truth come out first.

1479
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,000
What are you?

1480
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,600
Need not to know.

1481
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,100
I'm just an ordinary pupil.

1482
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,600
Thank you, Conan-kun.

1483
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,500
The reason you said those words at that time

1484
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,900
is to stimulate me to recover my memory, right?

1485
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,400
When we in the restaurant, you must have heard

1486
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,200
what my father said to my mother when he proposed to her, right?

1487
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,300
I love you.

1488
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,000
More than anyone else on this planet.

1489
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So you intentionally said the same thing to me.

1490
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Uncle Mouri said it too?

1491
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,100
Didn't you?

1492
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,000
Yeah... You're right.

1493
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,900
See, I knew it.

1494
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:56,000
After all, there's an huge age difference between us.

1495
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,500
But I'm really happy. Good night.

1496
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,500
Good night.

1497
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Fine.

1498
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,500
Wait, does that mean...

1499
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:17,700
I'm thinking in the same way as Uncle Mouri?

1500
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,500
No way.
