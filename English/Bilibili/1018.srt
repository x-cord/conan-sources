00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.310
Kudo

2
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.170
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

3
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.350
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.310
Sera's hypothesis and fearless smile!

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.460
The Akai family closes in on the truth!

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.000
Always determining the one truth

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.790
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.590
his name is Detective Conan!

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.540
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden

10
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.600
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden

"The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part One!"

11
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.990
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part One)

12
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.990
What?

13
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.910
You're going to make a
fortune off an antique dish?

14
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.670
Come on.

15
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.280
Have you forgotten your painful
experience with the Persian rug?

16
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.260
I know.

17
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.840
That's why I had an appraiser
look at it this time.

18
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.720
He called to let me know he has my results,
so I'm on my way to get them now.

19
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.220
So, where'd you get the dish?

20
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.890
I've taken you kids before to
my uncle Agasa Kurisuke's villa.

21
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.570
Oh, right.

22
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.650
That villa with the hidden
star, sun, and moon code.

23
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.590
That's right.

24
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.570
That was before you came here, Ai-kun.

25
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.030
Yes, I heard about it from the children.

26
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.980
It started as a treasure hunt
you set up at the villa,

27
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.000
but the code led up into an attic.

28
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.670
They even found a mummified corpse and
plates for making counterfeit bills.

29
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.670
In the end, they caught the
scoundrel who wanted the plates.

30
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.030
That's right.

31
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.930
I found an old wooden board
in the back of a shelf

32
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.430
when I went to hide the
toys for the treasure hunt.

33
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.790
Since the handwriting was so nice,

34
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.940
I brought it home and put it on display.

35
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.270
Just the other day,

36
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.440
I realized it wasn't a board,
but a flat box with a sliding lid.

37
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.950
I found an antique dish inside.

38
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.450
Huh.

39
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.840
My uncle Kurisuke was a wealthy man.

40
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.090
I thought it might be a
rather valuable antique,

41
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.460
so I asked an appraiser I
know to appraise it for me.

42
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.000
Are you sure it was okay
for you to take the dish?

43
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.200
Uncle Kurisuke passed away 50 years ago.

44
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.360
Aunt Teiko who inherited the villa
said I could do whatever I wanted

45
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.970
with the things inside the villa.

46
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.310
She passed away last year
anyway, so it's mine now.

47
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.450
So, why'd you call me here?

48
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.320
I'm the one who invited you over.

49
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.250
I'd like you to do something about her.

50
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.320
Her?

51
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.030
That tomboy named Sera Masumi who's watching
us from behind the gate as we speak.

52
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.320
That's why you had me
come in through the back?

53
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.710
That's right.

54
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.350
If you came in through the front
door, she would've come with you.

55
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.140
So, why is she watching this house?

56
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.630
You know, don't you?

57
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.530
Well, it's not the house.

58
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.060
It's probably you.

59
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.990
What?

60
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.050
Why would she be watching me?

61
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.190
Well, a-actually...

62
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.730
What?!

63
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.200
She suspects that I've been turned into
a child by that drug, just like you?

64
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.700
How could you expose our secret like that?

65
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.950
Do you want to die?

66
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.700
It's not like that.

67
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.110
Sera's got keen instincts.

68
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.840
Apparently she asked Ran and Sonoko if
they knew any mature kids besides me.

69
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.420
They told her you fit that description.

70
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.550
So, do you know any other kinds who
are strangely mature for their age?

71
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.000
It's got to be Ai-chan, right?

72
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.060
Yeah, Haibara Ai.

73
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.050
She lives at Professor Agasa's house.

74
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.280
She's more than just mature.

75
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.000
She's got a totally cool personality.

76
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.400
She's probably got a lot
of questions for you.

77
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.410
In any case, I don't know
what she wants to ask me,

78
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.920
but if your so-called "Black
Organization" finds out

79
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.420
that we've been turned into
children by APTX 4869,

80
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.060
they'll kill both you and I,

81
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.780
as well as anyone associated with us.

82
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.680
Yeah.

83
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.790
I know that.

84
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.440
D-Did she get impatient and decide
to try a direct approach instead?

85
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.650
Hey!

86
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.340
Make her leave!

87
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.000
What?

88
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.390
Hurry!

89
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.240
Jeez.

90
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.750
How am I supposed to make her leave?

91
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.810
Yes?

92
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.310
S-Subaru-san.

93
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.460
I received a bunch of cherries from
an acquaintance, so I came to share.

94
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.190
More importantly, did you
see anyone at the gate?

95
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.970
Yes, I did.

96
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.870
There was a girl wearing a motorcycle helmet.

97
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.690
Huh?

98
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.600
Conan-kun, what are you doing here?

99
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.100
I came here early this morning
because I had something to do.

100
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.650
Oh, really?

101
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.150
In that caseâ€”

102
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.530
By the way, Professor,

103
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.470
how did the appraisal of that antique go?

104
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.780
I was just on my way to get the results.

105
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.290
He said he'd show me something interesting
he's appraising while I'm there.

106
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.790
Something interesting?

107
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.730
Are you familiar with Chinese
black lacquer trays?

108
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:31.680
They're wooden objects painted with
layers of black and red lacquer

109
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.100
until they're completely black
with patterns carved into them.

110
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.730
You mean like the tray that appeared
on the appraisal TV show the other day?

111
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.030
Anywhere Appraisal

112
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.850
Anywhere Appraisal
I think it was worth 100 million yen.

113
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.360
100 million yen?

114
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.230
That's right.

115
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.810
Apparently three people saw that program

116
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.110
and realized they had similar trays at
home and asked him to appraise them.

117
00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:01.880
Surprisingly, all three trays have
exactly the same crane design on them.

118
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.150
Does that mean of the three
trays, two of them are fake?

119
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.380
Exactly. He said the real tray would be
worth several tens of millions of yen.

120
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.740
He invited me to come watch
him explain the difference

121
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.210
between the real tray and the
fakes to the people who hired him.

122
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.310
I see.

123
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.310
In that case, would it be all right if I
accompanied you to this appraiser's house?

124
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.980
I'd like to see that black
lacquer tray for myself.

125
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.660
S-Sure, that's fine.

126
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.320
What will you do?

127
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.950
I think I'll pass.

128
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.830
I'm not interested in antiques.

129
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:42.830
What?

130
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.980
So I'll watch the house for
you, along with that girl.

131
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.090
You're not interested in
old trays either, are you?

132
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.180
So that's her angle.

133
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.970
I'm... I'm going with the professor!

134
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.100
I love old trays!

135
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.550
Then maybe I'll go, too.

136
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.100
After all, it's worth several
tens of millions of yen, right?

137
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.110
Suddenly I'm interested.

138
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.170
Then why don't all five of us go?

139
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.480
I-I suppose.

140
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.830
That's that. I look forward to
spending time with you, Ai-chan.

141
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:26.030
Come on, we're both girls.
There's no need to be so cold.

142
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.900
Hey, Subaru-san.

143
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.490
Come with me.

144
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.600
Why did you invite Sera?

145
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.300
Sorry, kid.

146
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.560
I couldn't allow her to continue
behaving suspiciously at the gate.

147
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.610
Besides...

148
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.430
There's something I've been
wanting to ask my sister.

149
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.940
Hey, the character for "Ai" in
Haibara Ai means sadness, right?

150
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.420
That's a little unusual, isn't
it? Did your parents choose that?

151
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.810
It looks like she's asleep.

152
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.210
Excuse me. Nishitsu-san!

153
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.410
It's Agasa, here for my appointment.

154
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.730
Nishitsu-san!

155
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.220
Maybe his hearing aid is acting up again.

156
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.690
I'll go get him. Wait there.

157
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.980
Understood.

158
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.200
Nishitsu-san.

159
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.860
By hearing aid, did he mean the
"Deaf Angel" he made before?

160
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.780
Yes.

161
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.630
The Deaf Angel works fine at first,

162
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.730
but quickly develops issues and it
becomes difficult to hear anything.

163
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.380
Like they say, names and natures often agree.

164
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.630
"Names and natures often agree?"

165
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.370
You know some difficult phrases.

166
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.630
Yes, is there a problem?

167
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.150
Now she's fighting back.

168
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.730
High quality lacquer has
been applied in layers.

169
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.720
It's truly exquisite.

170
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:08.980
There are probably people who would pay
80 millionâ€”no, 100 million for this.

171
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.940
There are probably people who would pay
80 millionâ€”no, 100 million for this.
Nishitsu Hogen (71)
Antique Art Appraiser

172
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.750
There are probably people who would pay
80 millionâ€”no, 100 million for this.

173
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.870
I asked you to wait in the other room.

174
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.030
What's the matter?

175
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.730
Did you call me?

176
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.530
In that case, I must apologize.

177
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.040
It seems my hearing aid is acting up again.

178
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.850
More importantly, take a look.

179
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.540
Look at its dignified and
magnificent appearance.

180
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.410
This is the real black lacquer tray.

181
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.420
Unfortunately, it's not the one you brought.

182
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.750
No...

183
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.060
However...

184
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.440
That's my tray!

185
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.740
Excuse me.

186
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.620
Nishitsu-san.

187
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.840
It's Agasa, here for my appointment.

188
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.310
Nishitsu-san.

189
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.760
Nishitsu-san.

190
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.630
Where are you, Nishitsu-san?

191
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.380
Nishitsu-san.

192
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.430
Nishitsu-san?

193
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.220
What happened?

194
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.290
Who did this to you?

195
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.720
Th-This... this is the real tray...

196
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.560
The real tray?

197
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.190
Wh-What's this?

198
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.880
A crane design?

199
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.560
Must be the black lacquer tray he mentioned.

200
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.990
In any case, we need to call
an ambulance and the police.

201
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.490
Oh, no. My phone is in my car.

202
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.970
Nishitsu-san, wait here. I'll be right back.

203
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.270
What?

204
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.650
He was bleeding from the head
and lying on the ground?

205
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.060
The appraiser?

206
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.300
Yeah, with the black lacquer
tray right in front of him.

207
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.240
Did you call an ambulance?

208
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.290
The thing is, I left my phone in the car.

209
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.930
Haibara, call an ambulance and the police.

210
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.660
Got it.

211
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.120
Take that turn. It's the
second room from the end.

212
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.380
That's the room.

213
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.800
What's this?

214
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.040
It's no use. He's dead.

215
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.170
Hey, Conan-kun.

216
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.940
I don't see a tray anywhere.

217
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.520
What?

218
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.070
What's going on here?

219
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.130
You're making quite a lot of noise.

220
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:07.860
What's wrong?

221
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.780
Who are you?

222
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.390
You're not scoundrels here
to steal my tray, are you?

223
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.460
If you're outsiders, could you please leave?

224
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.510
He lost a lot of blood from his head.

225
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.880
There's also a rather deep
stab wound on his back.

226
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.770
According to the coroner,

227
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.000
the cause of death was
most likely aortic injury

228
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.980
due to the stab wound in his back
inflicted by a pointed bladed object.

229
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.720
Pointed bladed object?

230
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.570
Yes.

231
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.740
The weapon was almost certainly that
spear closest to us over there.

232
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.390
The culprit's fingerprints weren't on it,

233
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.280
but there's blood on the tip of the blade.

234
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.250
There are also marks on the metal base that were
made when it was used to strike something.

235
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.640
I see.

236
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.980
Judging by the fact that the victim
Nishitsu-san was still alive

237
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:12.510
when Agasa-san first came to
this room around 2PM today,

238
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.510
after knocking down the
victim with the spear,

239
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.190
the culprit probably hid inside a
wardrobe since Agasa-san arrived.

240
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.690
And after Agasa-san left the room
to call the police and an ambulance,

241
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.400
using the spear they used to knock him down,

242
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.350
they finished him off by
stabbing him in the back.

243
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.030
By the way, Agasa-san,
what are you doing here?

244
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.610
I asked Nishitsu-san to
appraise an old dish for me.

245
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.860
I came to hear the results.

246
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.800
I brought some friends who
happened to be at my house.

247
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.620
If you asked him to appraise
something, does that mean...

248
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.220
Yes.

249
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.220
The victim Nishitsu-san was
an antique art appraiser.

250
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.770
But why would someone kill
an antique art appraiser?

251
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.610
Probably because of the black lacquer tray.

252
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.730
Black lacquer tray?

253
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.960
Yes.

254
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.840
It's a type of Chinese lacquerware.

255
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.240
Apparently he was asked to appraise one
worth several tens of millions of yen.

256
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.440
Agasa-san said the tray
was in front of the victim

257
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.040
as he was bleeding from his head
and barely breathing in this room,

258
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.040
but that tray is no longer there.

259
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.700
Perhaps that means that's
what the culprit was after.

260
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.050
Actually, if that black lacquer
tray is in that box over there...

261
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.810
This tray here.

262
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.180
Then it hasn't been stolen.

263
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.180
See the two similar boxes next to that one?

264
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.570
Why don't you take a look inside those?

265
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.420
Seriously?

266
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.610
All three contain the same tray.

267
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.890
What's going on here?

268
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.260
He happened to receive three
requests to appraise trays

269
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.660
with the same pattern at the same time.

270
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.550
Because a similar black lacquer tray

271
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.840
was appraised at 100 million
yen on an appraisal TV show.

272
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.590
100 million yen?

273
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.030
This tray is worth that much?

274
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.850
Apparently the victim said he'd
explain the difference between

275
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.600
the real tray and the fakes to us and the
three clients who hired him to appraise them.

276
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.860
It's natural to think there's a
culprit who killed the appraiser,

277
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:38.110
and put the real tray in their own box

278
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.080
in order to get their hands on
that fortune among you three.

279
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.780
I see.

280
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.290
Then one at a time, why don't you tell us

281
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.860
your name, profession,

282
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.170
and what you were doing where around
2PM when the murder took place?

283
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.680
My name is Tojima Motoyuki.

284
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.000
I'm a salaryman at a securities company.

285
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:04.670
Tojima Motoyuki (41)
Securities Company Employee

286
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.690
Tojima Motoyuki (41)
Securities Company Employee
I realized there was a tray identical to
the one seen on the appraisal TV show

287
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:07.810
I realized there was a tray identical to
the one seen on the appraisal TV show

288
00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.710
in the storage shed I inherited from
my father, who passed away last year,

289
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.440
so I hired an appraiser.

290
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.350
I thought it'd be nice if
mine were worth that much.

291
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.780
So you wanted to sell your tray for money.

292
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.980
I don't have any money problems.

293
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.040
There's just nothing better than having
a nest egg for after retirement.

294
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.670
What were you doing where around 2PM?

295
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.440
Nishitsu-san said his professor
friend would be arriving soon,

296
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.860
so he asked the three of us to
wait in this reception room.

297
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.410
I went to the bathroom, but got
lost since this house is so large.

298
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.340
I wandered around for a while.

299
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:53.020
While wandering around, I heard
them running down the hallway,

300
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.070
so I went to that room.

301
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.700
We're talking about 100 million yen!

302
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.660
I bought that tray 20 years
ago for 100 million yen!

303
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.630
Mine's obviously the real one!

304
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.910
C-Could you tell us your
name and profession first?

305
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.060
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President

306
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.330
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President
Chono Kinji.

307
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:12.780
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President

308
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.920
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President
Until ten years ago, I was the
president of a real estate company.

309
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.630
Until ten years ago, I was the
president of a real estate company.

310
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.170
Now I'm retired.

311
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.140
What were you doing around 2PM?

312
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.220
I was in this reception room
with this woman for a while,

313
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.580
but sitting still isn't for me.

314
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.300
I went to the study and was absorbed in
reading about old works of art when, like him,

315
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:42.080
I heard someone noisily running
down the hallway and headed there.

316
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.370
I see.

317
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.680
In any case, mine is the
real black lacquer tray.

318
00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.610
If that tray is fake,

319
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.000
I'd be too embarrassed to face my family.

320
00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.510
I am Sakamaki Suzue. I am the
director of the Furuito Art Museum.

321
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:01.960
Sakamaki Suzue (46)
Art Museum Director

322
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.140
Sakamaki Suzue (46)
Art Museum Director
I brought the black lacquer tray that has
been on display at the museum for many years.

323
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.510
I brought the black lacquer tray that has
been on display at the museum for many years.

324
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.050
We wanted to make that
tray the main attraction

325
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.730
of our reopening after
the museum's remodeling.

326
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:20.640
The museum owner asked me
to confirm the piece's value,

327
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.490
so I hired an appraiser.

328
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.520
We're curious to know if it's worth as
much as the tray seen on the TV show.

329
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.490
I see.

330
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:37.000
I never dreamed there would be two
other people with similar trays.

331
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.170
You were in this reception room around 2PM?

332
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.620
Yes, alone.

333
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.930
At first, the housekeepers were here with me.

334
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.750
This home has housekeepers?

335
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.210
Come to think of it, I think I
met two when I came here before.

336
00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.260
This woman sent them shopping after
she said she doesn't like sweet things

337
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.160
and asked if they had salty rice crackers.

338
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.550
All I did was ask if they had any.

339
00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.520
I didn't demand them.

340
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.560
It didn't sound that way to me.

341
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.530
But...

342
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.460
Those housekeepers just returned.

343
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.640
Apparently they were getting more ingredients
for dinner while shopping for rice crackers.

344
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.710
I see.

345
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.840
Is there nobody else in this house?

346
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.470
Normally the son and his wife live here,

347
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.150
but they're currently on vacation.

348
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.160
Huh.

349
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.470
I see.

350
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.070
In other words, excluding the
three of us in the entryway,

351
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.580
at the time of the murder,
the people in this house were

352
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.840
Tojima Motoyuki-san who got lost
on his way back from the bathroom,

353
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.660
Chono Kinji-san who was reading
books on antiques in the study,

354
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.960
and Sakamaki Suzue-san who was
alone in this reception room.

355
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.670
The three of you could move
freely throughout the house.

356
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.670
Any one of you could've stabbed
Nishitsu-san to death with a spear.

357
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.520
Since a spear has a long handle,

358
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.930
you wouldn't get much blood on you
even if you hit or stabbed someone.

Next Conan's hint.

378
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.840
Crane
A crane!

Crane
