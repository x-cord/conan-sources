1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.240
We've safeguarded the plan double and triple fold.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.040
All preparations for making it look like an accident

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.840
have been completed.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.340
I've prepared the poison quite some time ago already.

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.540
Let's confirm if he has red blood flowing through him too.

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.740
Fortunately, the museum will be closed next Sunday.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.840
None of the staff beside us will show up.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240
Great.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.940
The sooner the better.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.540
That reminds me, Mr. Seikanji.

11
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.840
The deadline for repaying the loan is closing in, isn't it?

12
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240
What...

13
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.540
Look who's talking.

14
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.840
I heard that you embezzled money, and it was exposed,

15
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.340
so you're going to be fired at the end of this month.

16
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.940
I don't want to be told that by a manager

17
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.540
who fell for junk stocks and incurred a huge loss.

18
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.840
So, I'm the only one

19
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.240
that doesn't have to rush to finish things off.

20
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.040
Is that so?

21
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.540
As his ex-girlfriend, I'll bet you're worried about

22
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.140
when your inheritance deed will go down the drain.

23
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.440
Come now, there's no use arguing now.

24
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.940
We've got only one common purpose to pursue.

25
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.640
That is, to murder Jisaburo Izumi.

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.040
That's why we're gathered here, aren't we?

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.040
So, I'd like to confirm with you one more time, Moyono.

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.440
In case we succeed in murdering Jisaburo,

29
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.840
we split half the inheritance that is due to you

30
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.940
among us three.

31
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.740
The one who actually succeeds in killing him gets 80%,

32
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.940
and the remaining two gets 10% each

33
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.840
to keep their mouths shut.

34
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.540
I kind of feel like I'm the only one who's losing out.

35
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.440
But, I guess it can't be helped.

36
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.440
Because if I do it alone and fail,

37
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.540
everything'll go to pieces.

38
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.840
If all three of us pitch in, the odds of succeeding

39
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.340
would be greater.

40
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.140
Okay. Then, we'll launch the plan next Sunday.

41
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.840
Aim for a 100% solution.

42
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.940
Clear all mysteries and codes.

43
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.840
A dangerous conversation at the Noh Mask Museum.

44
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.240
The secret of the threesome hiding behind the mask.

45
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.440
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:25.421
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 1)"

49
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:36.521
Huh? It seems to be closed today.

50
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:37.921
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:41.321
Never mind, this is an emergency.

52
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:44.121
Yes?

53
00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:46.621
I would like to see the director!

54
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:48.321
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:53.221
We're closed today so Director Izumi resting today.

56
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.721
Excuse me. I'm Naruya Akaza.

57
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:59.821
I have an appointment with Mr. Izumi.

58
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.721
Oh, Ms. Moyono Mibu?

59
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:10.121
Long time no see.

60
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:14.521
I'll open the front door right now.

61
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:26.121
I can't let you in.

62
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:27.921
Like I just told you a while ago,

63
00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:30.121
it's our day off today.

64
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.121
No, please don't bother.

65
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:36.121
I came to see the director because of an emergency.

66
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:37.321
The director?

67
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:38.721
An emergency?

68
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:43.721
The fact is, I received this letter, you see.

69
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:48.221
That Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

70
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:57.921
Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.

71
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:01.921
The culprit will soon be carrying out his plan.

72
00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:05.621
I'd like you to take on this case, renown Detective Kogoro Mouri.

73
00:06:05.621 --> 00:06:08.621
The name of the sender isn't written.

74
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:10.921
What shall we do, Dad?

75
00:06:10.921 --> 00:06:13.821
That man called Izumi is rich, isn't he?

76
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.121
If you prevent the crime from happening, Pops...

77
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.521
Okay! Let's go, Ran!

78
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.421
If I don't go after receiving a letter like that,

79
00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:24.321
I'd be hurting my reputation!

80
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.721
I tell you, and you don't even know for sure

81
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.221
if the letter is authentic or not.

82
00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:32.321
All I really wanted to do is to go see the Noh masks!

83
00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:35.021
So, you see,

84
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:38.021
I decided to stick my nose in and offer my services.

85
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:39.921
And, you are?

86
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:45.321
Oh, pardon me. Here's my business card.

87
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:50.321
Oh! So, you're that famed detective, the Sleeping Kogoro!

88
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:54.021
Well, I guess that's what people call me.

89
00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:03.821
I'm a long time acquaintance of Director Izumi.

90
00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.921
But to think you'd bring your children along

91
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:07.921
when investigating a forewarning of murder.

92
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:11.821
No, this kid is interested in seeing Noh masks.

93
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:13.021
I see.

94
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:15.621
Your daughter has refined taste.

95
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.521
Huh? Oh, thank you.

96
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:24.021
I wonder where the word got out from?

97
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:26.921
To think that the famed detective would come all the way here.

98
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:30.421
I guess it'll be better to postpone our plan.

99
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:32.921
Where's the director?

100
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:36.221
It's just about time for him to go to worship the "Household God".

101
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:38.921
That's why Akaza's taking them there.

102
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.921
We can't postpone the plan already.

103
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.621
Huh?

104
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:48.021
Don't tell me you set a trap up there?

105
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:49.921
This is bad.

106
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:56.921
What's a household god?

107
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:59.421
In houses from the days of old, there is a tradition

108
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:04.321
of worshipping ancestors on the northwest side of the premises.

109
00:08:04.321 --> 00:08:07.621
Is Mr. Izumi a religious character?

110
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:11.321
Well, there are many who resent him, you see.

111
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:15.221
So he certainly has a good reason to pray.

112
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.121
Oh, there he is.

113
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:20.521
Good morning, Director Izumi!

114
00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:22.921
Mr. Akaza, eh?

115
00:08:22.921 --> 00:08:24.521
You're right on time.

116
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:25.521
"Izumi Jisaburo (65), Noh Mask Museum Owner"

117
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.821
"Toba Hatsuho (28), Jisaburo's Assigned Nurse"

118
00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:36.321
And? Who are you people?

119
00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:50.021
I'm used to blackmail. So, leave me alone.

120
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:53.821
Somebody took the trouble to send it over to my place, you know!

121
00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:56.621
It's hard to believe that this is a mere threat letter.

122
00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:12.921
Take cover!

123
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.521
Quick, behind there!

124
00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:52.221
If these children weren't here,

125
00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:55.421
I would've been crushed under the lumber.

126
00:09:55.421 --> 00:09:59.021
Hurry and get me a spare wheelchair!

127
00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.221
Yes, right away, sir!

128
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:03.321
Not you.

129
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:04.821
Hurry it up, will you?

130
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:07.121
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

131
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:19.121
Darn! That old fart devil has the devil's luck.

132
00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:28.021
You can't trust anybody these days.

133
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:34.221
But I'll trust you sonny because you saved me.

134
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:36.921
And, you too, young lady.

135
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:42.821
Sir, you never know what'll happen in the world today.

136
00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:44.921
Being on guard is top priority.

137
00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:47.421
Yep, that's for sure.

138
00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:49.721
And? What do I have to be on guard about?

139
00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:53.721
For example, what're those things decorated there?

140
00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:59.421
"Ju" and "Odoshi".

141
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:02.921
"Ju" is a belt like shaped braided rope used for decoration.

142
00:11:02.921 --> 00:11:05.521
"Odoshi" is part of the armor.

143
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:09.021
Then, they're both strong, aren't they?

144
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:11.221
What're you getting at?

145
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:12.621
Huh? A bee?

146
00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:13.821
It's big.

147
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:16.321
I'm going to be killed!

148
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:18.121
No need to get so overly excited.

149
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:20.221
That's not it. It's a hornet.

150
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.821
Director Izumi's been stung once before.

151
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:26.821
Bad! He may die of allergic shock!

152
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.021
There's another one?

153
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:40.921
Why, you! How about this? And this?

154
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:44.821
Hey, that's my jacket...

155
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:51.621
What do you think, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro,

156
00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:53.921
of my prized collections?

157
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.921
Well, they're all fantastic masks.

158
00:11:57.921 --> 00:12:00.021
Do you think it matches me too?

159
00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:05.721
In order to create a quiet Noh atmosphere,

160
00:12:05.721 --> 00:12:09.621
the staff as a general rule, wear Noh masks.

161
00:12:09.621 --> 00:12:11.621
This is called the "Kuwaemen".

162
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:13.621
You can wear this mask just by biting on this

163
00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:15.621
and holding it in your mouth.

164
00:12:15.621 --> 00:12:18.221
You can't talk when wearing it, though.

165
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:19.921
That's why the director says

166
00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:22.921
you can maintain a quiet Noh atmosphere.

167
00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:24.921
The maker of the mask was a man

168
00:12:24.921 --> 00:12:27.821
called Kodo Matsumoto, my best friend.

169
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:30.821
He repeated marrying and remarrying several times.

170
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:35.021
And, I eventually ended up taking care of him until he passed away.

171
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:39.321
The director has an eye for good artists.

172
00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:40.921
In return for that, he entrusted

173
00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:44.521
the exhibition of his posthumous works to me.

174
00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:47.421
The accident that occurred, and the hornet that came flying.

175
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.721
The content of the letter was authentic, wasn't it?

176
00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:01.321
This museum was a mansion that originally

177
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:03.521
belonged to my grandfather, you see.

178
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:05.721
The only thing that is left even now

179
00:13:05.721 --> 00:13:09.321
is this Japanese hearth that is in the center of this mansion.

180
00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.421
This called "Yokoza",

181
00:13:11.421 --> 00:13:14.221
the place where the head of the household sits.

182
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:16.421
Sonny, do you know?

183
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.121
Huh? Know what?

184
00:13:19.221 --> 00:13:20.221
It's uncooked.

185
00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:21.921
That in the reflection of the light of the fire

186
00:13:21.921 --> 00:13:24.821
from the Japanese Hearth, the entire family enjoy chatting.

187
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:26.021
Then, see!

188
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:28.621
In the light of the fire the mask looks white, right?

189
00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:30.521
The word 'omoshiroi', meaning 'interesting',

190
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:32.821
evolved from that.

191
00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:35.621
Oh, that's interesting.

192
00:13:37.021 --> 00:13:41.021
Originally there was a grid called Hidana (rack)

193
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:43.521
in which a pot hanger was hooked onto.

194
00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:47.421
But, since it's not of much use now, it's stored.

195
00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:49.921
That wooden fish attachment

196
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:52.821
was thought to be a magical object that prevented fires.

197
00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:27.914
Darn! Not again!

198
00:14:33.614 --> 00:14:37.214
Darn that chestnut, for exploding at a time like that!

199
00:14:37.214 --> 00:14:40.414
We all goofed together, didn't we?

200
00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:43.114
Darn! Let's start from scratch!

201
00:14:47.114 --> 00:14:50.214
Oh, so this is what we're having for lunch?

202
00:14:50.214 --> 00:14:52.714
As a token of my appreciation for you having saved my life,

203
00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:55.214
I catered all this.

204
00:14:55.214 --> 00:14:58.214
Thank you so very much. Here goes...

205
00:14:58.214 --> 00:15:00.314
It wasn't meant for you.

206
00:15:00.314 --> 00:15:03.114
The ones who saved me are the children!

207
00:15:04.914 --> 00:15:08.814
This is just a little gift for you.

208
00:15:08.814 --> 00:15:12.014
It's washed-rind cheese from Bourgogne.

209
00:15:12.414 --> 00:15:15.114
You just got back from France, didn't you?

210
00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.714
I guess I'll open wine too, then.

211
00:15:22.614 --> 00:15:24.014
Wow, it looks so delicious.

212
00:15:26.214 --> 00:15:31.014
It's so smelly that it's known as "God's stink feet".

213
00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.014
But, when you eat it, it tastes like rich milk.

214
00:15:35.014 --> 00:15:39.014
It's good manners to just scoop it with a spoon this way.

215
00:15:39.014 --> 00:15:41.814
Chief, Manager, all of you,

216
00:15:41.814 --> 00:15:43.314
come and get a taste of the gift too.

217
00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:45.214
No, thank you, not for us.

218
00:15:45.214 --> 00:15:48.514
Or are you confessing to being the culprit

219
00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:51.114
behind those three pranks?

220
00:15:51.114 --> 00:15:53.114
No way.

221
00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:55.214
Then, we will do as you wish.

222
00:15:55.214 --> 00:15:57.314
Yes, come, come.

223
00:15:57.314 --> 00:15:59.614
Choose to sit wherever you like.

224
00:15:59.614 --> 00:16:01.214
If you eat it together with us,

225
00:16:01.214 --> 00:16:03.614
you couldn't possibly poison it, could you?

226
00:16:03.614 --> 00:16:06.314
Hatsuho, will you act as a taster?

227
00:16:06.314 --> 00:16:07.414
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:19.414
It's delicious!

229
00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.614
I'm sure it is.

230
00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:24.314
What do you think, Mr. Akaza,

231
00:16:24.314 --> 00:16:27.014
which wine would go better with it?

232
00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:30.114
I've got to taste it first to know.

233
00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.314
Then, go on and take a bite too.

234
00:16:32.314 --> 00:16:34.514
Thank you.

235
00:16:41.514 --> 00:16:44.514
Yes, it has a deep taste to it...

236
00:17:02.614 --> 00:17:05.614
This smells obviously of poison.

237
00:17:05.614 --> 00:17:07.514
It can't be.

238
00:17:07.514 --> 00:17:09.314
Who and when was it laced with poison?

239
00:17:13.514 --> 00:17:16.414
Everybody, don't move.

240
00:17:16.414 --> 00:17:18.514
Chief, where are you headed?

241
00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:22.514
I'm going to call the police.

242
00:17:22.514 --> 00:17:27.014
I'll take care of that, so you all stay here.

243
00:17:27.014 --> 00:17:28.514
-Ran! -Yes.

244
00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:32.614
Don't touch the cheese.

245
00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:35.014
Dad, no good.

246
00:17:35.014 --> 00:17:37.914
This area seems to be out of service range.

247
00:17:37.914 --> 00:17:40.214
The phone is in the kitchen over there.

248
00:17:40.214 --> 00:17:42.114
I'll go make the call.

249
00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:44.014
Then, will you call Inspector Megure of MPD

250
00:17:44.014 --> 00:17:46.014
and tell him that you're calling for Kogoro Mouri.

251
00:17:46.014 --> 00:17:47.014
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:50.614
Hello, is this the police?

253
00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:53.314
One of our customers died an unnatural death.

254
00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:55.314
Please rush over here.

255
00:17:56.514 --> 00:17:58.814
Even if the police cars were to speed over here,

256
00:17:58.814 --> 00:18:00.614
it would take them at least 20 minutes.

257
00:18:00.614 --> 00:18:04.814
Do I have to stay sticky like this until then?

258
00:18:04.814 --> 00:18:07.314
I guess you wouldn't want to be.

259
00:18:07.314 --> 00:18:08.714
Was your name Ms. Toba?

260
00:18:08.714 --> 00:18:10.114
Yes.

261
00:18:10.114 --> 00:18:12.014
Can you just wipe the place around Mr. Izumi

262
00:18:12.014 --> 00:18:13.614
and leave the rest as is?

263
00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:14.914
All right.

264
00:18:14.914 --> 00:18:17.414
They say they'll be right over.

265
00:18:17.414 --> 00:18:19.114
Moyono Mibu...

266
00:18:19.114 --> 00:18:22.214
She couldn't have put the poison in.

267
00:18:22.214 --> 00:18:25.514
Chief Seikanji, Manager Nagata.

268
00:18:25.514 --> 00:18:28.514
Those two didn't go near the cheese either.

269
00:18:28.514 --> 00:18:32.014
Ms. Toba was the taster, so at the time she tasted it,

270
00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:34.814
there probably wasn't any poison in the cheese.

271
00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:36.514
If so, was it after that?

272
00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:40.114
No, nobody had time to do something like that.

273
00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:44.214
If so, maybe the poison wasn't in the cheese,

274
00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:47.614
but rather, on the butter knife?

275
00:18:47.614 --> 00:18:51.314
Miss, where was this butter knife?

276
00:18:51.314 --> 00:18:55.414
Huh? On each guest's plate.

277
00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:58.614
And without knowing who would sit where,

278
00:18:58.614 --> 00:19:01.614
it would be impossible to target someone specifically.

279
00:19:06.214 --> 00:19:09.014
Hey, kid, we're moving to different place!

280
00:19:13.414 --> 00:19:16.314
This is much safer.

281
00:19:16.314 --> 00:19:18.414
Don't you agree, Mr. Mouri?

282
00:19:19.914 --> 00:19:21.414
Very true.

283
00:19:21.414 --> 00:19:25.014
Please bear with me until the police get here.

284
00:19:25.014 --> 00:19:26.714
Huh? Ran.

285
00:19:26.714 --> 00:19:28.414
Where's the brat?

286
00:19:28.414 --> 00:19:31.314
Huh? I thought he was just there.

287
00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:33.814
I'll go get some coffee to serve Mr. Izumi.

288
00:19:33.814 --> 00:19:36.114
I'll go look for the boy while I'm at it.

289
00:19:36.114 --> 00:19:38.314
Oh, thanks so much.

290
00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:44.214
Something about the call she made to the police a while ago

291
00:19:44.214 --> 00:19:46.514
was strange.

292
00:19:48.114 --> 00:19:50.814
This is an extension phone!

293
00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:52.814
Sonny.

294
00:19:53.714 --> 00:19:55.514
Are you there?

295
00:19:55.514 --> 00:19:56.614
Sonny?

296
00:19:58.014 --> 00:19:59.414
Sonny?

297
00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:03.014
That woman...

298
00:20:08.314 --> 00:20:09.514
That's?

299
00:20:16.314 --> 00:20:18.114
Mouse! There's a mouse!

300
00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:22.714
Did you spill the coffee?

301
00:20:22.714 --> 00:20:24.214
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:25.714 --> 00:20:29.114
Mr. Izumi's asking if his coffee's ready yet.

303
00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:30.914
Oh, right away!

304
00:20:30.914 --> 00:20:32.614
I'll help you!

305
00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:34.114
No, thanks!

306
00:20:37.514 --> 00:20:40.814
I guess you had no time to put in the poison this time.

307
00:20:42.814 --> 00:20:45.214
Which means that Mr. Akaza

308
00:20:45.214 --> 00:20:48.214
had a reason for being murdered?

309
00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:51.014
He used to enthusiastically flatter me,

310
00:20:51.014 --> 00:20:53.714
but it seems he was doing evil business.

311
00:20:53.714 --> 00:20:55.514
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

312
00:20:56.114 --> 00:20:59.914
I'm not ready to die like Akaza.

313
00:20:59.914 --> 00:21:02.514
Please don't joke like that.

314
00:21:02.514 --> 00:21:04.114
Don't worry.

315
00:21:04.114 --> 00:21:07.314
There's nobody who'll want to poison anyone to death

316
00:21:07.314 --> 00:21:09.714
when the police is on their way.

317
00:21:09.714 --> 00:21:11.814
Well, that's true too.

318
00:21:15.314 --> 00:21:20.014
Hey, Conan, that's an extension phone for sure.

319
00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:23.814
I tell you! That father of mine

320
00:21:23.814 --> 00:21:26.514
believes that the police'll be here any minute soon.

321
00:21:26.514 --> 00:21:28.814
At any rate, let's go look for a phone.

322
00:21:32.214 --> 00:21:34.114
Yep! I found it, Conan.

323
00:21:35.514 --> 00:21:37.714
What seems to be the matter, Miss?

324
00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:41.614
I've got to call the police right away.

325
00:21:41.614 --> 00:21:44.914
Huh? I'm sure that Ms. Mibu made the call already.

326
00:21:44.914 --> 00:21:48.414
She was just acting it out.

327
00:21:51.414 --> 00:21:52.914
Ran, run away!

328
00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:58.314
Don't you move either, Miss.

329
00:22:05.014 --> 00:22:07.414
So I said, aren't you gonna drink the whole thing?

330
00:22:14.614 --> 00:22:15.714
I'll bet it never dawned on you that

331
00:22:15.714 --> 00:22:17.514
all three of us were accomplices.

332
00:22:17.514 --> 00:22:20.914
You stay put right there until we finish off the director.

333
00:22:20.914 --> 00:22:23.514
So, you mean that person called Nagata is also one of them?

334
00:22:23.514 --> 00:22:24.714
Darn!

335
00:22:26.314 --> 00:22:28.614
Director Izumi s life's in danger!

336
00:23:56.814 --> 00:23:58.314
They sure are late, aren't they?

337
00:23:58.314 --> 00:23:59.714
The inspector and his men.

338
00:23:59.714 --> 00:24:02.514
I'll go check the front door.

339
00:24:02.514 --> 00:24:03.914
So, it's you.

340
00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:07.314
And, we almost made it, but too bad.

341
00:24:12.914 --> 00:24:15.014
Dad, hang in there!

342
00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:18.414
Next Conan,

343
00:24:18.414 --> 00:24:22.014
"The Ogre Dances in the Noh Mask Mansion (Part 2)"

344
00:24:37.714 --> 00:24:39.714
Next Conan's Hint:

345
00:24:39.714 --> 00:24:42.014
"Chisel"

346
00:24:42.014 --> 00:24:43.814
They have information on the movie starting today.

347
00:24:43.814 --> 00:24:45.314
What? Lupin vs. Kogoro?

348
00:24:45.314 --> 00:24:47.114
It's Lupin vs. Conan.
