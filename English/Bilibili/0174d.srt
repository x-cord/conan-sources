1
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:11,693
I've figured it all out, now all I have to do is prove it.

2
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:13,293
Excuse me.

3
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:16,393
We're looking the boy who speaks with a Kansai dialect.

4
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:20,093
That kid asked us the same thing and we've been looking for him too.

5
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:22,193
But we can't find him anywhere.

6
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:23,693
Sorry, Dr. Agasa.

7
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:25,093
I can't talk now.

8
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:28,393
I'll call you later...

9
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:29,493
What did you say?

10
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,593
We'll get the entire crew to search the ship again.

11
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:34,593
I'd appreciate that.

12
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:40,093
Gosh. What are you doing here?

13
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:41,993
Well, nothing.

14
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,193
I'm getting worried, where did he go to anyway?

15
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,293
Who are you talking about?

16
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:47,393
Are you serious?

17
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:50,193
Hattori, of course!

18
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:52,593
Him?

19
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:56,693
He's probably swimming with the fishes somewhere.

20
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,293
Mouri.

21
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,393
This guy might just be...

22
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:06,593
Yes, I know what you mean...

23
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,393
Dad?

24
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:17,693
Pops? What's wrong?

25
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:19,393
Pops?

26
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:20,593
What're you doing?

27
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:21,793
Dad?

28
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:25,393
Ran, tell all the others to come here!

29
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:26,493
What?

30
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:29,693
I've figured everything out.

31
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,093
Go on, hurry!

32
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:32,093
What?

33
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:40,093
Is that true? You've solved the case?

34
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:41,193
That's right.

35
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:43,993
I've figured everything out

36
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:46,693
the entire truth behind this case.

37
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:49,993
You're not going to say that Kanie is not the killer, are you?

38
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:53,693
No, Kanie is the killer.

39
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:58,293
Like you said, he pretended to be dead

40
00:01:58,293 --> 00:02:01,293
then lay in wait for a chance to kill his victim.

41
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:04,593
Mr. Kujirai, that was you!

42
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:07,593
Then whose body is that, that was set on fire?

43
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:09,893
It's Mr. Kameda.

44
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:11,693
First,

45
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:15,693
Mr. Kanie lured Mr. Kameda out and shot him,

46
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:19,493
then hid the body inside the emergency ladder box at the bow

47
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:22,793
and returned to join the others.

48
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:25,893
Then he set the flag on the upper deck on fire,

49
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:30,393
when everyone ran up to the deck, he set fire to the box.

50
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,793
The reason why he didn't change Mr. Kameda's clothes

51
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:35,293
as soon as he was put in the box is

52
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:38,293
he was waiting for the superintendent to give up

53
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,993
the search for the old man named Kano.

54
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,793
It takes a long time to dress someone

55
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:47,093
and he couldn't risk being seen by the superintendent.

56
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,893
And the proof is the way the victim's arms

57
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:52,893
were up beside his face!

58
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:55,493
If you raise the arms when putting the body into the box,

59
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,093
even after rigor mortis sets in,

60
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,593
dressing the body is easy.

61
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:03,393
And the reason the watch wasn't clasped was

62
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:07,893
his watch probably didn't fit Mr. Kameda.

63
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,893
Before setting the fire,

64
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:13,093
Mr. Kanie called Mr. Kujirai out to the stern

65
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:16,593
and was tried to set him up as the killer.

66
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:19,493
Because the first person found hanging around a crime scene

67
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,993
usually viewed as a strong suspect.

68
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:27,393
But why? Why did he have to make it look like he was dead?

69
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:31,493
He wanted to surprise his next victim, which was Mr. Kujirai,

70
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:34,693
and fill him with fear.

71
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:38,693
He wanted vengeance against the men who betrayed him 20 years ago.

72
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,293
Betrayed?

73
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:41,293
Yes!

74
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:45,793
That old man named Kano was also a ruse to scare the men,

75
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,793
the old man did not really exist.

76
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:53,293
Look at the wound on Mr. Kanie's body.

77
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:57,793
This old bullet wound is the very proof!

78
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:00,093
You... don't mean...

79
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:03,893
That's right! This is the Mastermind in the shadows,

80
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:07,993
the man everyone thought died 20 years ago,

81
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,993
Saizo Kano.

82
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:17,093
You're lying...

83
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:19,393
I don't believe you.

84
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,093
You're lying.

85
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:26,593
This man couldn't possibly be Saizo Kano.

86
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:30,093
Because Kano is... Kano is...

87
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:34,393
He is my father!

88
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:39,693
Your father?

89
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:41,293
That's right.

90
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:44,093
Saizo Kano, the Mastermind in the shadows,

91
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:46,993
is my real father.

92
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:49,193
The reason I joined this tour is

93
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:52,693
I wanted to find him who was rumoured he was killed 20 years ago

94
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,593
by his accomplices.

95
00:04:55,593 --> 00:05:00,193
I thought that maybe he was still alive,

96
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:03,393
but no one here reminded me of him.

97
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:07,093
But what if he'd had plastic surgery and changed his appearance?

98
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,893
Don't be ridiculous!

99
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,893
I'd recognise him no matter how he looked!

100
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,393
Do you think I couldn't recognise my own father?

101
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,893
And it'd be the same with him!

102
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:18,693
If he saw me, you'd know by his reaction!

103
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,093
20 years may have gone by, but it we'd know each other.

104
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:26,693
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

105
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,893
Forgive me, Nagisa.

106
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:32,893
I had my suspicions but I needed proof.

107
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:37,293
So that I could completely destroy the killer's plan.

108
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,793
The killer's plan?

109
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:44,093
Yes, the killer rigged it to look like Mr. Kanie shot Mr. Kameda,

110
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,793
dressed him in his clothes and set him on fire.

111
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,693
This would make us think he faked his death.

112
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:53,593
Then he hid somewhere firing shots leading us on wild goose chases.

113
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:58,693
After failing in his attempt to kill Mr. Kujirai,

114
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:01,393
he realised he could not escape, so he killed himself.

115
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,393
That was the scenario.

116
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,893
It was all a ruse to make us believe Mr. Kanie was Saizo Kano

117
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,093
and that the killings on this ship

118
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,093
were to carry out a vendetta against the men

119
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:16,093
who betrayed him 20 years ago.

120
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:19,893
Then, you mean the killer is...

121
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:23,593
That's right. It's someone else

122
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,193
and he is right here!

123
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:26,393
No way!

124
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:31,993
Hey... What are you talking about, Mouri?

125
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:34,393
You know for yourself.

126
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,993
When the explosion went off at the bow,

127
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:41,193
all the passengers here were on the upper deck!

128
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,193
And all the other crew members have alibis.

129
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,693
Besides, you said so yourself,

130
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:48,693
you'd need a timing device to have set it off...

131
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,493
I found it!

132
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,593
I found the timing device!

133
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:54,593
You found it? In there?

134
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,693
He used a cigarette.

135
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:59,193
He put a can of gasoline in the box,

136
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:03,693
then placed a lighted cigarette on the lid of the box.

137
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,393
If you wind it with thread,

138
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,993
it'll take about ten minutes for the thread to burn.

139
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,693
The cigarette will fall inside

140
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:12,993
and a fire will start automatically.

141
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:19,593
But then, how do you explain the four shots

142
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:23,293
that came from the bow and the two from the prow?

143
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,993
Even then all of us here were...

144
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:28,193
He used a cigarette then too.

145
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:31,593
He probably taped some fireworks

146
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:35,093
and a cigarette to the railing.

147
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:40,393
After it explodes, the evidence will fall into the ocean.

148
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,093
There were burn marks on the railing

149
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:46,693
and some paint had been off, that proves my theory!

150
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:50,893
By the way, regarding the flag burning on the upper deck,

151
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,093
he used the same trick, first soaking the flag in gasoline,

152
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:57,793
then attaching the cigarette and fireworks.

153
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:00,793
Which means, by using this method,

154
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:05,193
anyone could have committed the crime.

155
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:08,893
So who did it?

156
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:11,393
Who did all that?

157
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:12,793
It's...

158
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,393
It's too late!

159
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,999
-What was that? -There was an explosion in the rear!

160
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,299
Stop all engines! All stations check for damages!

161
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,399
Yes, sir!

162
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,399
Lower deck! Any damages?

163
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,399
No damages!

164
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,799
No need to worry.

165
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,799
The bomb just went off about 100 meters behind the ship.

166
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,199
100 meters behind the ship?

167
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,699
Was that a bomb?

168
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,399
Just to be on the safe side,

169
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,999
we put it on a rubber boat which we tied a rope to the other end

170
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,999
was attached to the railing on the bow,

171
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,699
then we let it out on the ocean.

172
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,699
Mr. Ebina.

173
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,899
It was the bomb we found in your trunk.

174
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,599
-What? -Trunk?

175
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,699
How did you know?

176
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,399
Your room was very clean, even your sheets were unwrinkled

177
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,699
and your trunk looked like it hadn't even been opened,

178
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,699
then when I noticed how concerned you were about the time,

179
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,399
it made me suspicious.

180
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,499
That bomb was probably meant to kill

181
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,499
all the members of that robbery 20 years ago,

182
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:35,199
you prepared it a long time ago, didn't you?

183
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:40,699
You wanted to avenge the death of your co-worker, didn't you?

184
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,399
Co-worker?

185
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,099
The distinctive way he counted money,

186
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,699
indicated he worked in a bank.

187
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,299
Also, he whispered the name of the female bank teller

188
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:56,099
who was killed in the robbery.

189
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:59,299
Yoshimi Samezaki.

190
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,699
She wasn't just another co-worker,

191
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,599
she was...

192
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:09,099
she was the most important thing in the world to me.

193
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:13,199
You're the one who cried so loudly at my daughter's funeral?

194
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:15,199
Yes, that's right!

195
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,099
After the funeral, I quit the bank

196
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,099
and I've been going from job to job ever since,

197
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:23,099
looking for those killers in my own way!

198
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:25,399
Even after the statute of limitations ran out!

199
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,099
I see. So it was you.

200
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:35,599
So you're the special person she asked me to meet.

201
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:38,099
If only you...

202
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,099
If only you... that day...

203
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,699
If only you'd come to the bank like you promised!

204
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:47,099
She... she'd probably...

205
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,899
Forgive me.

206
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:55,699
One of my men was stabbed that day.

207
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,999
I heard about what happened when I was at the hospital.

208
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,199
You saw that advertisement in the newspaper

209
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,499
and joined the tour too, didn't you?

210
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:11,099
Yes, I thought this might be it.

211
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,599
If I was wrong,

212
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:16,599
I intended to throw the trunk into the ocean before the bomb went off.

213
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,699
So it was you?

214
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:26,899
Did you kill all those men involved with the robbery?

215
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,899
What? No!

216
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,699
I didn't do it!

217
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,199
I just brought a bomb with me!

218
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,099
I didn't know anything about the guns!

219
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:37,399
It's the truth! Please believe me!

220
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,999
It's all right. I know it.

221
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,399
I know you're not the killer.

222
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,199
Like I said before, to set Mr. Kanie up as the killer,

223
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:53,599
one had to make this seem like Saizo Kano's act of vengeance,

224
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,399
or it wouldn't seem plausible.

225
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,699
The reason the killer disguised himself as an old man,

226
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:01,199
then left the ship and returned as someone else is,

227
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:05,599
he wanted to create the illusion that Saizo Kano was alive.

228
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:10,299
He left a message on the bill hinting of Kano on the upper deck.

229
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,899
This was all part of his plan to make us think

230
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,999
Kano was trying to scare the men who betrayed him.

231
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,199
And all of this was so that we would think that

232
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,799
the gunshot wound on Mr. Kanie's body was the wound Mr. Kano got

233
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,999
when he was shot by one of his accomplices 20 years ago!

234
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,299
You mean that wound...

235
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:36,299
He probably got that when he served in the foreign army long ago.

236
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,399
Do you remember? One of the suspects

237
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,599
was reported to have served in an foreign army.

238
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:44,999
And he was one of the accomplices...

239
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:45,999
So that means...

240
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:50,599
Yes, the only one who could use that fact in this scheme

241
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:54,799
is someone who knew about Mr Kanie's wound.

242
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,999
You don't mean...

243
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,799
One of his old partners, Mr. Kujirai!

244
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,599
You're the only one, aren't you?

245
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,099
That's insane.

246
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,399
First, you saw Mr. Kameda leave the restaurant,

247
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,399
then you mentioned Saizo Kano's name.

248
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,299
In the excitement, you went to the engine room

249
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,699
where you had told Mr. Kameda to wait and you shot him!

250
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,299
Then you hid his body in the box on the stern.

251
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,999
He was killed in the engine room?

252
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,399
Yes, I've already found blood stains, a shell casing

253
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,499
and the letter he used to lure Mr. Kameda in the engine room.

254
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:35,599
You probably slipped the letter under the cabin door.

255
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:38,399
Mr. Kujirai came back to the lounge

256
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
and waited for the superintendent to call off the search for Kano,

257
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,499
then went to meet with Mr. Kanie,

258
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:48,599
probably in the toilet next to the restaurant.

259
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:53,699
Mr. Kanie was probably already asleep due to being drugged,

260
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,999
then you stole his clothes and his wristwatch

261
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:00,599
and put them on Mr. Kameda and set up that timing device.

262
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:05,199
After that, you deliberately called attention to yourself

263
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,499
so that you had the crew to witness the box was not on fire yet,

264
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:14,099
and give us the impression you were called out there to meet someone.

265
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,399
The reason why you left the note in the toilet's trash can

266
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,899
was to pretend to be afraid of Kano

267
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,699
so that Kanie would approach you.

268
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,699
You were probably going to say that it was in that book of matches.

269
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:33,599
It was all to make us believe Mr. Kanie was behind everything

270
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:37,199
and that he had lured you out.

271
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,399
You set the cigarette device on the flag

272
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,099
before you changed the clothes on the body.

273
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:48,399
That way, you could run up with everyone

274
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,599
when we heard the explosion

275
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,399
and we would be your alibi.

276
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,999
You moved Mr. Kanie who was sleeping from the toilet to the prow

277
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,699
while we were all concentrating on the burning body at the stern.

278
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:09,699
Then you watched our movements and after some time had passed,

279
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,699
you placed another device at the stern.

280
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,999
After hearing the sound and we went running,

281
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,999
you went back to the prow

282
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,399
and pulled Mr. Kanie back up and shot him.

283
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,099
And then you shot yourself and fired another shot

284
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:27,099
through the window into the restaurant.

285
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:32,699
After that, all you had to do was set two more devices!

286
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,699
You came back to the stern

287
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,699
and had us all gather in the restaurant

288
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,699
where you gave us your false confession

289
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,899
and waited for the explosions to go off.

290
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,999
If you fell at the first explosion,

291
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:49,499
it would look like the shot came from the prow!

292
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,799
Wait a minute, Mouri.

293
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:55,699
I was with him when he fell and I saw the wound right then.

294
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,899
If he shot himself earlier, there'd be more blood.

295
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,899
He used a tennis ball!

296
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,499
Before he shot himself in the arm,

297
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:05,999
he had the tennis ball pressed against his artery,

298
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,199
it was to stop the flow of blood!

299
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,299
He held it there tightly until the explosion went off.

300
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:16,599
Ran found the ball under the table in the restaurant.

301
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:19,699
He probably threw it there in the confusion

302
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,999
after the second explosion.

303
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:26,399
But why didn't he kill Mr. Kanie when he first took him to the prow?

304
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,199
If Mr. Kanie committed suicide right after we found the burned body,

305
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,899
the killer's trick would seem unnatural.

306
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,699
The trick with disguising the body with Mr. Kanie's clothes!

307
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,899
The reason he raised the body's arms

308
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,899
and unclasped the watch was to create an illusion!

309
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,599
That's also why he hired Heiji Hattori, a private detective from Osaka.

310
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:56,599
Of course, Mr. Kujirai probably figured to hire us as instead.

311
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,399
But you hired a private detective from Osaka

312
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,399
because you lived in Kansai area, didn't you?

313
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,199
When people who live in the Kanto area

314
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,099
put cards back into the case,

315
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,399
we don't use the term "fix".

316
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,199
I see.

317
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,299
Now all we need is evidence.

318
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,199
You'll probably find it

319
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,599
when you check the area around the shattered glass.

320
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,399
You'll get a luminal reaction.

321
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,799
There'll be just a trace but you'll find some smears

322
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,899
from when he wiped the blood that splattered

323
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:31,699
when he shot himself.

324
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,999
No! It wasn't me!

325
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,299
This is a trap!

326
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,899
Someone set this trap to frame me!

327
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:41,599
You jerk! Don't try to fool us!

328
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,799
That star sure is beautiful.

329
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,799
What?

330
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,399
What? What is that?

331
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:53,099
What is that strange star approaching from the left?

332
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,999
What is that?

333
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,399
That is...

334
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,399
Hattori!

335
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,299
That's right.

336
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,399
He can testify that you knocked him out and threw him overboard

337
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,399
when he found Mr. Kanie tied to the prow.

338
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,899
You can't deny anything anymore, can you?

339
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,799
Mr. Kujirai.

340
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,099
But how did you figure it all out?

341
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,599
That Kanie wasn't the real killer?

342
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,399
The watch...

343
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,099
The watch's stem is on the opposite side

344
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,999
because it's made for a right handed person

345
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,899
but it was put on his left hand.

346
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,899
At that point, I crossed Mr. Kanie off as a suspect.

347
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:43,699
You tried to make him look like you

348
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:47,999
but you were made a big mistake by putting the watch on wrong.

349
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:53,099
You were done in by your partner's expensive watch.

350
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,799
By the way, it was also Mr. Kujirai

351
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,099
who put the advertisement for this tour in the newspaper.

352
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,599
You all probably decided 20 years ago

353
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,899
that on the day the statute of limitations runs out,

354
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,099
you'd place an advertisement in the newspaper

355
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,399
under the name of Masaru Furukawa.

356
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:08,999
The reason the three got together was

357
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,699
they were going to get the money

358
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:13,999
they put into a safe deposit 20 years ago.

359
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,599
"Masaru Furukawa" -To take the money

360
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,899
out of the safe deposit box you rented 20 years ago,

361
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:21,899
you needed the key, the seal and the signature.

362
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:24,199
You three each had one of the items

363
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,899
and it would also be your identification

364
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,899
when you met each other after all those years

365
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:29,899
and after having plastic surgery done.

366
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,199
Mr. Kujirai who was in charge of the signature,

367
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:37,599
saw the seal and key Mr. Kameda and Mr. Kanie displayed nonchalantly,

368
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,599
so he knew right away who they were

369
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,199
and he immediately set his plan in motion.

370
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,899
I see.

371
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:47,699
After killing them and stealing the key and seal,

372
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,599
he intended to take the money all for himself.

373
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,099
What a fool.

374
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,199
The statute of limitations had run out

375
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:57,599
and he went through so much trouble.

376
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,399
I wanted to win.

377
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,299
I thought up a perfect plan,

378
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,799
but that Saizo Kano...

379
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,799
20 years ago, he said, "Your plan is full of loopholes."

380
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,899
I wanted to beat the Mastermind in the shadows!

381
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:15,399
But I don't understand!

382
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:20,299
Why are there so many people involved with that case all over this ship?

383
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,599
I didn't even mention the name Kano once in the advertisement.

384
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,899
Don't you know what Masaru Furukawa meant?

385
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,299
It's the nickname Kano used,

386
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,299
he said there were just a few strokes and it was easy to remember

387
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,299
so we were to use it when we needed to contact each other.

388
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,599
No one except us is supposed to know about it.

389
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,799
This is hilarious!

390
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,099
Turn the name sideways!

391
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:46,599
It becomes Saizo Kano, doesn't it?

392
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:51,099
That's why I joined this tour.

393
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:53,699
And also the statute of limitations ran out of that day.

394
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,499
I had my doubts.

395
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:59,299
Masaru Furukawa was Kano's alias

396
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,199
which he picked intending to be funny!

397
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:04,899
No way...

398
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:08,899
You were never any match for Kano never.

399
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:11,799
After all, for the past 20 years,

400
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,899
Kano had you by the coat tails.

401
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,099
What? You fell in the ocean?

402
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:53,099
You're kidding.

403
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,999
It's no joke! Someone pushed me from behind and I fell in!

404
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:59,399
Didn't you notice I was gone?

405
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,699
You're cold!

406
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:03,599
But you were lucky, you're alive.

407
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,199
I was floating in the ocean

408
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:08,299
and that fishing boat captain found me!

409
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,699
It was awful! I had to take all my clothes off

410
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:14,499
and use my flashlight to signal ships sailing faraway.

411
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,399
Worry a little!

412
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,599
You took your clothes off?

413
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,899
Of course!

414
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,599
You can try it!

415
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,099
Wet clothes soak up so much water and they're heavy!

416
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,299
If I didn't take them off, I would have drowned!

417
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,399
The only thing I kept was my pants

418
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,399
and the thing I have no idea when it had in my pocket...

419
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:36,599
"Don't forget it, you fool!" -this amulet.

420
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,099
I don't know whether it really works or not, though.

421
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,099
What are you staring at me for?

422
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:49,199
Come on now, don't play dumb!

423
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:52,199
You were looking at the amulet Kazuha gave you all dreamy eyed.

424
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,699
No, I wasn't.

425
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,799
This amulet's bad luck, I was thinking of throwing it away!

426
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,399
But I didn't want something bad to happen,

427
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,799
that's why I'm holding on to it!

428
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,399
Then don't you ever forget it?
