1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.240
Pops was scheduled to make an appearance on the iconic show,

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.240
"The Most Useful School in the World" from Nichiuri TV.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.440
While visiting the TV station where the filming would take place,

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.640
the prominent enka singer,

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.640
Mr. Noburo Kimijima, who was also appearing on the same show

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.540
showed off his proud vase to us.

7
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.040
The appraisal of his vase was to be conducted during the show.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.840
According to Mr. Kimijima,

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.740
it was valued at over 100 million yen.

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.240
However, that vase suddenly disappeared during the rehearsal.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.040
Could someone have stolen it?

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.340
If that was the case,

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.140
the culprit would have to be in this studio.

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.240
Like the fog clears.

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.340
Let's see through love and crime as well.

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.140
Surfacing from that popular show

17
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.240
is the mystery of the sudden missing vase.

18
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.040
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:36.381
"The Most Useful School in the World Case (Part 2)"

22
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:46.281
Will you hear me out, Mr. Kimijima?

23
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.381
Since the beginning of the rehearsal,

24
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:51.481
I haven't stepped out of the studio at all.

25
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.381
Well, it isn't just Principal Sakai.

26
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:58.281
If I'm right, no one carried any personal belongings

27
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:02.381
large enough to contain a vase, out of the studio during rehearsal.

28
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.981
"Mikihiko Kamisuwa (52)" -Anyway, let's split up

29
00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:07.181
"Nichiuri TV's Producer" -and search the studio carefully one more time.

30
00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:26.381
"Daisuke Tsuchiya (45), Director" -It's nowhere to be found.

31
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.581
Did it vanish just like that?

32
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:30.081
Vanished?

33
00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:32.081
It's not like it's a magic vase.

34
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.681
There's no way it could have vanished on its own!

35
00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.981
"Noburo Kimijima (67)" -That's a vase from the Qing Dynasty

36
00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:38.781
"Leading Figure in Enka" -with an estimated value of 100 million yen!

37
00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:41.981
I'm sure someone was dazzled by its worth

38
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.181
and hid it away with the intent to steal it!

39
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:45.181
Calm down, calm down.

40
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:47.981
We can't be sure about that at this point.

41
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.481
The sudden disappearance of an item...

42
00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:53.881
That reminds me. Mr. Takikawa conducted an interesting experiment

43
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.181
in his lab last week.

44
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.381
A fake flower placed on top of a pot filled with rice

45
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.581
disappeared all of a sudden.

46
00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:05.181
The truth was that a hose was inserted from underneath the flower pot.

47
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:06.381
When air was pumped out from it,

48
00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:08.281
the rice grains above floated with a swoosh.

49
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:11.181
The force supporting the flower plummeted in an instant,

50
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.581
causing the fake flower to sink into the rice.

51
00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:16.381
That's why it looked as if it disappeared.

52
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.081
But that trick is not applicable to this case.

53
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:23.581
As such, someone among us has to be the culprit.

54
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:27.981
I have a request, Mr. Mouri.

55
00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:31.481
Once and for all, can we rely on the deductions

56
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:33.981
of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri to find the vase?

57
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:36.781
Kindly lend us your strength again.

58
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:39.381
But even if you say so...

59
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:40.481
It'll be all right.

60
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:43.481
I'm sure Mr. Mouri can find the vase without fail!

61
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.781
Of... Of course, I will!

62
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:47.081
All right, then!

63
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:49.081
The great detective Kogoro Mouri

64
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:53.781
shall definitely recover Mr. Kimijima's vase without fail!

65
00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:55.681
Leave everything to me!

66
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:57.181
All right.

67
00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:01.381
Will dad be all right after blowing up a huge balloon of confidence?

68
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.981
Well, he has to do his best now.

69
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:08.181
Now, according to the testimony of the assistant director, Mr. Hashimoto,

70
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:09.781
"Yoshinari Hashimoto (22)" -Up until the end of rehearsal

71
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:11.081
"Assistant Director" -for the first period,

72
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.781
the vase was definitely still there.

73
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:17.681
Yeah. I was checking the props.

74
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:20.281
I also witnessed the vase at that time.

75
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:24.681
That said, if we assume that somebody stole that vase,

76
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:28.881
they would've had to do it during the second period rehearsal.

77
00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:31.781
While we were paying full attention to the puffed grain candy machine,

78
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.681
they seized the opportunity, stole Mr. Kimijima's vase,

79
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:39.781
and hid it somewhere in the studio in the blink of an eye.

80
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:42.081
However, we've searched everywhere just now,

81
00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:44.181
but we still couldn't find the vase.

82
00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:48.981
No. There is still a place we haven't searched yet.

83
00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.881
Mr. Yamazaki, let me ask you one thing.

84
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:53.581
"Tetsushi Yamazaki (32)" -What is it?

85
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:55.881
Regarding the storage case of the puffed grain candy machine,

86
00:05:55.881 --> 00:06:00.181
you were the one who checked its content, weren't you?

87
00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:01.281
Yeah.

88
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.481
Are you sure

89
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:07.581
we won't find Mr. Kimijima's vase inside it?

90
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:09.881
Hold... Hold on a moment!

91
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:12.181
Are you suspecting me now?

92
00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:16.481
Mr. Yamazaki, you have a motive.

93
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.181
During my rehearsal for the first period,

94
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:23.181
you were secretly taking pictures of Ms. Yoko.

95
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.381
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.681
I'm a fan of Yoko, so I couldn't help...

97
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:30.581
If you're a fan of her, you should respect her even more!

98
00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:38.581
Mr. Kimijima was furious at you

99
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.581
for taking pictures of Ms. Yoko without permission.

100
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.781
So he snapped your cell phone in half.

101
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:45.681
Holding a grudge against him for that,

102
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:50.681
you stole Mr. Kimijima's vase to get back at him, didn't you?

103
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:51.881
What nonsense.

104
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:56.581
If you say so, why not show us what's inside your case?

105
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:58.881
When I was testing my puffed grain candy machine,

106
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:01.381
I remained on set the entire time!

107
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:05.181
How on earth would I have time to steal the vase?

108
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.781
That's precisely where the blind spot is.

109
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:14.181
At that time, I believe nobody kept their eyes on you the entire time.

110
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.581
So why didn't you do the hammering yourself

111
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:18.781
instead of asking Ms. Yoko to do it?

112
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:23.081
Everyone's eyes were fixed on the candy machine in that instant.

113
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:28.781
Therefore, I believe no one was able to witness your whereabouts.

114
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.281
That's just your assumption!

115
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:32.481
Well...

116
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.281
The reason why I did the hammering

117
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:38.381
was because it was written on the script.

118
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:41.581
Hey, hey. Wise up, Pops.

119
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:44.581
That's why we've been telling you to at least read the script.

120
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:45.981
But...

121
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:50.481
Dad, Mr. Yamazaki took photos of Ms. Yoko without permission

122
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.881
and left a bad impression on you,

123
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:55.081
so you jumped into conclusions, didn't you?

124
00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:59.281
Nonsense! I'm not as narrow-minded as you may think.

125
00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:02.181
That man is definitely hiding something from us.

126
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.481
I have no doubt about it.

127
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:07.581
I shouldn't be surprised that Pops noticed it, too.

128
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:09.081
What are you doing?

129
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:11.181
At any rate, we should be able to find out

130
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:13.081
once we see the content of that case!

131
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:15.581
Mr. Yamazaki.

132
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:16.881
I'm sorry to ask this,

133
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:19.981
but could you let us take a look inside your case as a precaution?

134
00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:22.281
That... But...

135
00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:32.581
Understood.

136
00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:40.381
That's my...

137
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:42.681
Mr. Yamazaki.

138
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:45.881
Would you care to explain what this is about?

139
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:49.681
I'm sorry. My impulses got the best of me.

140
00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:52.281
As Mr. Mouri said, I was indeed furious

141
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.881
because my cell phone was snapped into pieces.

142
00:08:55.881 --> 00:08:57.281
As a grown man,

143
00:08:57.281 --> 00:09:00.081
it's insolent of you to take peeping photos of an idol.

144
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.381
You should be ashamed.

145
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:05.181
But still, you didn't have to break it!

146
00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:08.881
Screw it! I'm going home!

147
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.081
Wait! Please hold on.

148
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:15.881
After that, I noticed the handkerchief Yoko was using

149
00:09:15.881 --> 00:09:18.381
fell onto the chair.

150
00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:20.881
So I thought if I auctioned off the handkerchief and a photo of Yoko

151
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:23.881
as a set over the internet,

152
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:26.781
I could maybe sell it to the fans for a high price.

153
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:29.581
Bastard! Stop screwing around like that!

154
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:32.681
Hold it, dad! Calm down!

155
00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:35.381
But wasn't the photo in question unusable

156
00:09:35.381 --> 00:09:39.181
since it was destroyed by Mr. Kimijima along with the cell phone?

157
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:44.181
I bet he set it so that photos will be saved in a memory card.

158
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:46.081
By doing that, his photos will remain intact

159
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:48.581
even if the cell phone is not.

160
00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:49.981
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:51.281
You've caused another problem.

162
00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:54.581
But for now, we need to focus on Mr. Kimijima's vase.

163
00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:57.481
Where on earth did it vanish to?

164
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:02.681
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

165
00:10:02.681 --> 00:10:04.781
"Kentaro Honma (70)" -What's the matter, Mr. Honma?

166
00:10:04.781 --> 00:10:06.581
"Antique Appraiser" -Why are you asking me that?

167
00:10:06.581 --> 00:10:08.881
If problems keep surfacing like that,

168
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.381
the filming for today will be called off, right?

169
00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:14.481
No, we haven't decided on doing that just yet.

170
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:18.681
I have a busy schedule. Please do excuse me.

171
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:21.981
Please wait, Mr. Honma.

172
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:25.081
My apologies, but before you leave,

173
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:28.581
would you mind showing us the contents of that large baggage?

174
00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:31.881
Mr. Honma! Are you the culprit?

175
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.881
How will you explain this, Mr. Honma?

176
00:10:49.728 --> 00:10:54.128
Mr. Honma! You were pretty intrigued by that vase.

177
00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:57.328
Remarkable...

178
00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:00.928
Where did you get this?

179
00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:03.028
Well, well, Mr. Honma.

180
00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:05.828
I can see that it caught your eye.

181
00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:08.728
Also, during the puffed grain candy machine demonstration...

182
00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:19.028
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

183
00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:21.328
I'm not interested in that.

184
00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:25.328
Didn't you leave the set all by yourself?

185
00:11:25.328 --> 00:11:29.228
Are you saying I'm the culprit just because of that?

186
00:11:29.228 --> 00:11:31.328
I merely think that it's possible

187
00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:36.128
to conceal a vase in a baggage like that.

188
00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.628
I see.

189
00:11:43.028 --> 00:11:44.828
Are you satisfied now?

190
00:11:44.828 --> 00:11:48.328
It isn't there. My vase isn't there!

191
00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:50.928
I apologize for doubting you.

192
00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:53.628
No, it's true that if one carries such a large baggage

193
00:11:53.628 --> 00:11:57.128
out of the studio, suspicion will surely ensue.

194
00:11:57.128 --> 00:11:59.128
Please don't worry about it.

195
00:11:59.128 --> 00:12:00.628
Now, please excuse me.

196
00:12:00.628 --> 00:12:03.228
Please hold on, Mr. Honma.

197
00:12:03.228 --> 00:12:05.028
What else do you want?

198
00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:08.828
It's not like we have decided to terminate our filming.

199
00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:12.028
Forget Mr. Yamazaki's second period lecture for a moment.

200
00:12:12.028 --> 00:12:14.928
As for your third period lecture, Mr. Honma,

201
00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:17.028
we will still continue filming as planned

202
00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.528
if we recover Mr. Kimijima's lost vase.

203
00:12:19.528 --> 00:12:23.128
As such, may I ask you not to go home just yet?

204
00:12:23.128 --> 00:12:25.628
Even if you do manage to find the vase,

205
00:12:25.628 --> 00:12:27.928
I doubt you'll be able to continue filming.

206
00:12:27.928 --> 00:12:30.528
-Pardon? -Oh, no.

207
00:12:30.528 --> 00:12:32.228
It was nothing.

208
00:12:32.228 --> 00:12:35.128
They won't be able to film even if the vase is found?

209
00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:37.228
What does that mean?

210
00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:40.328
Does he know something else?

211
00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:41.528
Mr. Kamisuwa.

212
00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:45.128
Even if you say so, we're already fairly behind schedule.

213
00:12:45.128 --> 00:12:47.928
Enough is enough!

214
00:12:47.928 --> 00:12:50.928
Hey! The culprit is among us, isn't it?

215
00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:54.428
In that case, show yourself and return my vase at once!

216
00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:57.028
Please calm down, Mr. Kimijima.

217
00:12:57.028 --> 00:12:59.128
Besides Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Honma,

218
00:12:59.128 --> 00:13:02.328
nobody in this studio has personal belongings

219
00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:05.628
large enough to conceal your vase.

220
00:13:05.628 --> 00:13:08.628
Then, where on earth is my vase?

221
00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:12.228
It's true that no one carried a container out of the studio

222
00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:15.128
that's big enough to conceal the vase.

223
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.728
Having said that, we did search everywhere in the studio

224
00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:20.028
but failed to locate the vase.

225
00:13:20.028 --> 00:13:24.328
But of course, it couldn't have vanished just like that.

226
00:13:24.328 --> 00:13:26.828
I'm sure I've missed something.

227
00:13:26.828 --> 00:13:28.228
What could it be?

228
00:13:29.228 --> 00:13:31.028
We can't help it.

229
00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:33.228
Let's call it a day and stop our filming.

230
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:34.428
Okay.

231
00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:36.028
Apologies!

232
00:13:36.028 --> 00:13:38.328
As for today's filming, we'll call it a day here.

233
00:13:38.328 --> 00:13:41.228
The art staff members, please disassemble the set!

234
00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:44.228
Dissemble the set?

235
00:13:44.228 --> 00:13:46.528
Hashimoto, lend me your cutter.

236
00:13:46.528 --> 00:13:47.828
Sure.

237
00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:54.028
I see! So that's how it was!

238
00:13:56.628 --> 00:14:00.828
Dad, isn't it about time you got sleepy?

239
00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:03.028
We still haven't located the vase.

240
00:14:03.028 --> 00:14:07.128
Getting sleepy is not something...

241
00:14:07.128 --> 00:14:09.828
I should do or I shouldn't...

242
00:14:09.828 --> 00:14:13.028
Monkey see, monkey do...

243
00:14:13.028 --> 00:14:16.128
Hold on for a moment.

244
00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:18.528
The first thing we need to deal with is not the set,

245
00:14:18.528 --> 00:14:20.628
but the case.

246
00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:23.228
Then, do you know who the culprit is?

247
00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:25.628
Yeah. The whereabout of the vase, too.

248
00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:27.128
Are you sure?

249
00:14:28.228 --> 00:14:30.728
So this is the Sleeping Kogoro's famous deduction.

250
00:14:30.728 --> 00:14:33.528
We shall see its true worth with our very own eyes.

251
00:14:33.528 --> 00:14:37.528
The culprit still has the vase.

252
00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:39.628
The culprit still has it?

253
00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.328
Still has it?

254
00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:44.728
But everyone here is empty-handed, dad.

255
00:14:44.728 --> 00:14:46.328
Look closely, Ran.

256
00:14:46.328 --> 00:14:50.828
Among us, two people are wearing waist bags.

257
00:14:56.428 --> 00:15:00.328
When the staff said they were disassembling the set earlier,

258
00:15:00.328 --> 00:15:04.328
I confirmed the contents of Assistant Director Hashimoto's bag.

259
00:15:05.728 --> 00:15:08.028
Please check it however you want.

260
00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:10.028
I only put these things inside it.

261
00:15:10.028 --> 00:15:13.228
In that case, Ms. Shinobu Oki,

262
00:15:13.228 --> 00:15:15.328
-you're the one... -Hold it right there!

263
00:15:15.328 --> 00:15:17.228
What on earth are you saying?

264
00:15:17.228 --> 00:15:19.228
That vase from the Qing Dynasty

265
00:15:19.228 --> 00:15:22.028
could never fit into such a small waist bag!

266
00:15:22.028 --> 00:15:25.128
Right, of course. However,

267
00:15:25.128 --> 00:15:30.128
it's more than possible if one shatters the vase.

268
00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:33.328
What did you say? The vase was...

269
00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:35.628
shattered?

270
00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:38.828
That Qing vase valued at 100 million yen?

271
00:15:44.728 --> 00:15:46.528
Ms. Shinobu.

272
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:49.428
But if the vase was shattered,

273
00:15:49.428 --> 00:15:51.928
wouldn't everyone immediately notice the sound?

274
00:15:51.928 --> 00:15:54.728
Nobody was able to notice that.

275
00:15:54.728 --> 00:15:57.528
Everyone, please recall what happened

276
00:15:57.528 --> 00:15:59.228
during the rehearsal for the second period lecture.

277
00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:04.728
When all of us were focusing on the puffed grain candy machine,

278
00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:07.928
you secretly went through the back of the set

279
00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:10.128
and put the vase in a bag you prepared beforehand

280
00:16:10.128 --> 00:16:13.428
so that the shards wouldn't scatter.

281
00:16:13.428 --> 00:16:17.828
Then, Ms. Yoko used the hammer to hit the machine.

282
00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:19.628
With that timing...

283
00:16:21.128 --> 00:16:23.528
All right, here we go!

284
00:16:26.328 --> 00:16:29.628
You shattered the vase from outside the bag.

285
00:16:29.628 --> 00:16:34.428
Finally, you stuffed your waist pouch with a bagful of vase shards.

286
00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:38.328
And you reappeared at the scene like nothing happened.

287
00:16:39.228 --> 00:16:40.528
I see.

288
00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:42.428
She took advantage of the loud noise from the puffed grain candy machine

289
00:16:42.428 --> 00:16:44.728
to cover the sound of the shattering vase.

290
00:16:44.728 --> 00:16:46.628
Is that true?

291
00:16:57.728 --> 00:17:00.828
Why... Why did you do that?

292
00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:02.328
Why?

293
00:17:04.028 --> 00:17:05.328
Answer me!

294
00:17:05.328 --> 00:17:08.128
That's it! You!

295
00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:11.228
You were always yelling at her like that.

296
00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:14.928
I bet she hated you for that, Mr. Kimijima.

297
00:17:14.928 --> 00:17:17.128
Is that right?

298
00:17:17.128 --> 00:17:19.028
But...

299
00:17:19.028 --> 00:17:21.128
whatever hatred she might have had...

300
00:17:21.128 --> 00:17:23.228
I still can't believe someone in their right mind

301
00:17:23.228 --> 00:17:25.828
would smash a 100-million-yen vase.

302
00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:29.628
It just goes to show how much she despises him!

303
00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:39.428
Still, I have one more thing I'd like to ask Mr. Honma.

304
00:17:40.628 --> 00:17:45.128
It is about the appraisal result of that vase.

305
00:17:45.128 --> 00:17:47.328
You want me to reveal that now?

306
00:17:47.328 --> 00:17:48.828
Yes.

307
00:17:48.828 --> 00:17:52.228
But it doesn't seem like she wishes for that.

308
00:17:52.228 --> 00:17:53.628
That's true.

309
00:17:53.628 --> 00:17:57.628
But if this keeps up, Ms. Shinobu will be viewed as a bad person.

310
00:17:57.628 --> 00:18:00.328
Isn't that her choice as well?

311
00:18:00.328 --> 00:18:01.828
I know that.

312
00:18:01.828 --> 00:18:03.828
However,

313
00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:06.328
there is always only one truth.

314
00:18:06.328 --> 00:18:11.828
Even if it may go against Ms. Shinobu's will.

315
00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:13.328
Very well.

316
00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:18.928
On the subject of the Qing vase in Mr. Noburo Kimijima's possession...

317
00:18:21.828 --> 00:18:25.028
I deem it a remarkable counterfeit.

318
00:18:25.028 --> 00:18:27.828
That... That can't be.

319
00:18:27.828 --> 00:18:29.728
That can't be true!

320
00:18:31.128 --> 00:18:33.928
That vase was a counterfeit?

321
00:18:33.928 --> 00:18:36.128
-No way. -It can't be.

322
00:18:39.128 --> 00:18:40.828
Then, earlier today...

323
00:18:43.528 --> 00:18:45.728
It's this one.

324
00:18:45.728 --> 00:18:49.428
What do you think? It's quite a work of art, right?

325
00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:52.828
This is... Excuse me for a second.

326
00:18:56.128 --> 00:18:58.528
Remarkable...

327
00:18:58.528 --> 00:19:01.728
You meant to say it was a remarkable counterfeit?

328
00:19:01.728 --> 00:19:03.728
That's correct.

329
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.928
As expected, you have seen through its fakery.

330
00:19:08.928 --> 00:19:11.728
If I were to declare it a fake during filming,

331
00:19:11.728 --> 00:19:14.928
Mr. Kimijima would lose face as a result.

332
00:19:14.928 --> 00:19:18.528
At the same time, I cannot lie about my appraisal results.

333
00:19:18.528 --> 00:19:21.528
Troubled by this, I...

334
00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:25.528
tried to leave the set without a word before filming, but failed.

335
00:19:26.628 --> 00:19:29.828
I'm afraid she had the same feeling.

336
00:19:29.828 --> 00:19:31.028
Ms. Shinobu.

337
00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:34.728
Knowing how deeply Mr. Kimijima values his vase,

338
00:19:34.728 --> 00:19:37.328
you couldn't bring yourself to let out the truth.

339
00:19:37.328 --> 00:19:40.728
Then comes the invitation to be on the show.

340
00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:43.128
If the appraisal were to take place on the show,

341
00:19:43.128 --> 00:19:45.828
it would be revealed that it is a fake.

342
00:19:45.828 --> 00:19:48.628
Since you didn't break the news up to this point,

343
00:19:48.628 --> 00:19:52.428
your master was about to lose face on national television.

344
00:19:52.428 --> 00:19:54.228
Worrying yourself over this,

345
00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.528
you decided to make it look like a vase theft

346
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:59.228
to halt the filming, didn't you?

347
00:19:59.228 --> 00:20:02.128
Yes. It's exactly as you said.

348
00:20:02.128 --> 00:20:04.928
Shinobu, when did you find out

349
00:20:04.928 --> 00:20:07.928
that the vase was a counterfeit?

350
00:20:07.928 --> 00:20:11.428
A year ago, before your wife passed away,

351
00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:13.628
she called me to her bedside.

352
00:20:14.728 --> 00:20:16.728
Although that vase is a fake,

353
00:20:16.728 --> 00:20:20.228
it's still an irreplaceable treasure to you.

354
00:20:20.228 --> 00:20:24.028
So she told me to keep you from finding out at all costs.

355
00:20:24.028 --> 00:20:26.728
But since I couldn't keep the promise,

356
00:20:26.728 --> 00:20:28.228
and things turned out like this,

357
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.828
I am unable to remain by your side, Master Kimijima.

358
00:20:31.828 --> 00:20:35.228
With this, I will hang up my hat,

359
00:20:35.228 --> 00:20:37.228
give up on my singer dream and go home.

360
00:20:37.228 --> 00:20:40.828
Thank you very much for all these years!

361
00:20:40.828 --> 00:20:45.328
Shinobu, do not embarrass me any further.

362
00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:49.128
It's true that my eye for vases is gullible.

363
00:20:49.128 --> 00:20:54.528
However, I believe my discerning eye for singers is unclouded!

364
00:20:54.528 --> 00:20:58.028
Earlier, I received a call along with a reply.

365
00:20:58.028 --> 00:21:01.028
Your debut has been approved!

366
00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:05.528
Since the producer was rather indecisive,

367
00:21:05.528 --> 00:21:08.528
I went ahead and gave him an earful.

368
00:21:09.428 --> 00:21:11.528
Don't make me repeat myself!

369
00:21:11.528 --> 00:21:15.128
I said there's nothing to worry about, didn't I?

370
00:21:15.128 --> 00:21:16.328
Nonsense!

371
00:21:16.328 --> 00:21:19.128
Are you saying you can't trust my judgment?

372
00:21:19.128 --> 00:21:21.728
Shinobu Oki is a true talent!

373
00:21:21.728 --> 00:21:23.828
You have my assurance on that!

374
00:21:24.928 --> 00:21:27.928
Do you still plan to go home despite all this?

375
00:21:30.628 --> 00:21:34.028
Thank you very much. Thank you very much!

376
00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:36.028
Congratulations, Ms. Shinobu!

377
00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.128
Congratulations!

378
00:21:43.328 --> 00:21:45.728
"THE MOST USEFUL SCHOOL IN THE WORLD"

379
00:23:10.728 --> 00:23:13.628
Looks like I've somehow solved another case, but...

380
00:23:13.628 --> 00:23:16.328
It's no good, I can't remember anything.

381
00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:18.328
Mr. Mouri!

382
00:23:19.228 --> 00:23:22.328
I forgot to mention, but your necktie...

383
00:23:22.328 --> 00:23:24.628
So you've indeed noticed it?

384
00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:27.128
I wore this just to attract your attention, Yoko!

385
00:23:27.128 --> 00:23:30.028
It got stained by the gravy from your lunch box!

386
00:23:33.728 --> 00:23:35.628
Have a nice day!

387
00:23:40.328 --> 00:23:42.928
I'm gravely in shock.

388
00:23:42.928 --> 00:23:47.428
Even a necktie can't save him from embarrassment.

389
00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:52.628
Look out!

390
00:23:53.528 --> 00:23:57.828
What? In that case, is she really the real estate king

391
00:23:57.828 --> 00:24:01.028
Mr. Ouzaburou Katayose's granddaughter?

392
00:24:01.028 --> 00:24:03.028
That freak car was your doing, no?

393
00:24:03.028 --> 00:24:04.428
Were you driving the car?

394
00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:07.528
The garden fence! You put a hole in it, didn't you?

395
00:24:11.428 --> 00:24:14.328
Where did the culprit disappear to?

396
00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:19.328
Next Conan, "Solving Mysteries at the Red Leaf Palace (Part 1)".

397
00:24:20.597 --> 00:24:23.097
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:23.097 --> 00:24:25.397
"Milk Tea"

399
00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:28.197
Next Friday is a broadcast of the movie "The Raven Chaser"!

400
00:24:28.197 --> 00:24:29.676
Watch it at home!
