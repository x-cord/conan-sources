1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,140
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,240
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,640
Mystery that's out of season.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,540
Everybody's feelings help solve a case.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,940
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,868
Dear, please hang in there.

9
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,668
Don't let go, please.

10
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,768
Take it easy, Mrs. Nagakura.

11
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,868
Wait a minute!

12
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:12,968
This is not a mark left by hitting or scraping...

13
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,068
What is it?

14
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,768
Don't get in the way, young man.

15
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:20,168
Excuse me.

16
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,968
He's unconscious and seriously injured.

17
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:34,568
Questioning at the hospital would be difficult.

18
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:37,968
Well, I didn't notice anything.

19
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,968
I drank too much and was fast asleep.

20
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,568
Excuse me,

21
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:45,668
"Shokichi Sakaki (52)" -but Mr. Mouri can solve cases in his sleep.

22
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,768
Well...

23
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,968
Mouri?

24
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,468
You're the the Sleeping Kogoro,

25
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:54,068
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

26
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:56,768
The detective.

27
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,468
The famous detective, yes.

28
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:01,068
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.

29
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:03,268
The higher-ups gave me their consent.

30
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:06,368
So please help investigate this case with us.

31
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,468
From your higher-ups...

32
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,768
Well...

33
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:20,868
"Love, Ghosts and World Heritage (Part 2)"

34
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,068
We are expecting this village

35
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,868
to be registered as the World Heritage soon,

36
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:27,268
and we do not want any incident like this happening here.

37
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:30,068
As a matter of fact, I'm from this village,

38
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,968
and I hope the case closes as early as possible.

39
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:36,068
So please help us on this matter, Mr. Mouri!

40
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,168
I see.

41
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:39,468
If you insist,

42
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,568
I, Kogoro Mouri,

43
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,168
will give my best in this case.

44
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,368
Thank you very much, sir.

45
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,268
So rest assured and don't worry.

46
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:51,868
Well then, excuse me for rushing you,

47
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:52,968
but who is the culprit?

48
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,468
What?

49
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,468
It can't possibly be a ghost.

50
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:58,868
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:01,268
Of course not.

52
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:03,768
Oh, I'm speaking to the other party.

53
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:05,668
Then that means the culprit is...

54
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,368
Yes, of course.

55
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:08,568
It's him.

56
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:22,268
But you saw Mami too, right?

57
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:25,568
No. Something made you think you did.

58
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:28,468
You mean like the laundry?

59
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:33,268
But because Ayumi saw something,

60
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:36,168
it helped to find out which way the culprit fled.

61
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:41,568
This way leads to a dead end.

62
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,968
He leaves the village.

63
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:44,968
That means...

64
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:48,468
The culprit is yet to leave the village!

65
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,668
And at this time of the day,

66
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:54,368
he wouldn't choose to come from outside this village.

67
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:56,368
That means the culprit is

68
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,268
one of the people in Onizawa village,

69
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:00,468
including the tourists.

70
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,768
Who are you kids to...

71
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,068
Don't bother yourself over them.

72
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:08,668
Any layman can think up what they just said.

73
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:09,768
That's right.

74
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,768
Stay out of it, all of you.

75
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,768
Furthermore, there's something more important

76
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,668
that you should note.

77
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,368
And what's that?

78
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:22,568
The culprit hid the rope there in the daytime,

79
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:26,168
during the sightseeing tour,

80
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:30,468
and used that rope at night to break into the house.

81
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:33,668
Then it means that...

82
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:38,168
the culprit is somebody who is not from Mr. Nagakura house,

83
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,668
where the Mouri party stayed at,

84
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:43,168
but is definitely among one of the guests.

85
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,268
Just as expected, Mr. Mouri!

86
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:48,068
I'm so impressed!

87
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:49,368
It's nothing.

88
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:51,168
It's just one of the things I do!

89
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,868
That is that.

90
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,468
But the question is

91
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:59,168
what was the culprit doing there?

92
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:00,668
That's more important.

93
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:06,868
Don't push me, Genta.

94
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,368
Hurry up...

95
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,468
One more floor to climb.

96
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:14,268
Maybe he was just a thief after all?

97
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:18,368
But what was he trying to steal?

98
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:21,168
Then, did I imagine what I saw after all?

99
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:24,468
If Conan says so, he could be right.

100
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,768
But...

101
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:28,468
He was not exactly stealing something.

102
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:32,268
But I'm sure he was looking for something.

103
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,468
What was that thing he was looking for?

104
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:39,168
-What's wrong? -Nothing.

105
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,568
I just thought from here,

106
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,168
you can get a good view of the scene

107
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,568
where Mr. Nagakura was stabbed.

108
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:47,068
If you can get a good view from here,

109
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,868
it means this place is in clear view from there too.

110
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:53,368
Of course! That explains it!

111
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,268
What did you say?

112
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:58,768
Conan, did something happen?

113
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,468
Hey, kid!

114
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,268
Just as I thought. It's true.

115
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:12,168
What's wrong with this?

116
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,268
Keep off! You'll get a rash if you touch it.

117
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,568
A lacquer tree, isn't it?

118
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:20,168
I remember that the hand of Mr. Nagakura got...

119
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:26,268
Yeah. It means Mr. Nagakura passed by here yesterday.

120
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,368
Murderer!

121
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,068
You lied. Liar.

122
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,868
What is this all about?

123
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:36,968
He is the one

124
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:40,668
that was rude to everyone the day before yesterday.

125
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,368
Could it be that he did it to Mr. Nagakura?

126
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:48,068
But then, why are those villagers at each other?

127
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,168
I can explain that.

128
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,468
Why?

129
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:55,268
I read an article in a magazine on the way here.

130
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,868
When applying for the World Heritage,

131
00:07:56,868 --> 00:08:00,768
the villagers were separated into two opposing groups.

132
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:04,268
One group opposed saying that there would be no need for more tourism.

133
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:08,168
The other wanted to promote the existence of this village to the world.

134
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,368
If I remember correctly,

135
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,968
Mr. Nagakura represented the group that promoted the application.

136
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,568
Is that so?

137
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:15,968
That's why Mr. Nagakura was trying to say...

138
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,168
All of you...

139
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,568
-Who's behind all this? -Dear!

140
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:22,268
I got it. They are behind all this!

141
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,768
When he said "them",

142
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:26,268
he meant the opposing group.

143
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:28,368
Calm down, people.

144
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:31,868
Let the police take over and please go home.

145
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,668
-We can't. -Let's decide now.

146
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,768
-That's right. -Hey, he is getting away.

147
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:38,268
-Don't let him get away. Get him. -Stop it, everyone.

148
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,568
"Onizawa Village Office"

149
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,168
An investigator?

150
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,168
Yes. He said he was sent from the committee

151
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:48,368
that is involved in accepting applications for World Heritage.

152
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,068
I heard before that

153
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:54,768
there is a special undercover investigator,

154
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,668
who makes a fair evaluation.

155
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,768
That's right.

156
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:00,868
But in his case, he is the official investigator.

157
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,268
You took bribes from those municipalities

158
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:07,168
as resources for promotion.

159
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:09,168
Am I right, Mr. Kawaji?

160
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:10,668
I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:12,268
"Kensaku Kawaji (37)" -Cut it out.

162
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,768
Suits for damage have been filed already.

163
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,168
And we've got the goods on you.

164
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:18,768
You asked Mr. Nagakura for commission, but was turned down,

165
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,868
so you got mad at him, lost yourself

166
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,768
and did it, didn't you?

167
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:24,768
Stop talking nonsense!

168
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,968
Sure, I talked about money,

169
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:29,268
and it's true that I was turned down.

170
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,968
That's why I gave up and went to bed early

171
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:33,368
because I decided to leave here today.

172
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,668
I stayed inside the house.

173
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:37,268
You are an old dog at this business,

174
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:40,068
and you gave up just like that?

175
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,668
Do you expect me to believe you?

176
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,168
I'm an old dog at this business, that's why I gave up!

177
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,868
My experience told me the sooner I quit the better.

178
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:49,468
I know when I can't expect money!

179
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:50,968
Look at this!

180
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,568
This is...

181
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:55,168
It's Mr. Nagakura's watchman's record book.

182
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,468
The record says for the night

183
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:01,668
"All is well" up to the ninth house.

184
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,168
Mr. Nagakura was found

185
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:08,568
on the way to the ninth house.

186
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:10,068
It's very close to the Ishioka house

187
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,268
where you spent the night.

188
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,768
I don't know anything.

189
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:17,168
I didn't choose to stay in that house.

190
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,868
Is there anyone who saw you asleep?

191
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,368
I was alone in the room, so no one did.

192
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:25,768
But it's not me!

193
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:28,468
I didn't do a foolish thing like stab a man.

194
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:29,768
"Onizawa Village Office" -After that,

195
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:33,068
Kensaku Kawaji was taken to the police as a material witness

196
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,668
for extortion and attempted murder.

197
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,968
But he totally denied attempted murder.

198
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:43,368
He also denied charges for unlawful entry

199
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:45,668
into the Mr. Nagakura house.

200
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,868
So, the case seemed to be closed.

201
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:01,931
Thank you very much for everything.

202
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:05,431
Thanks to you, we were able to get Mr. Kawaji.

203
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:10,431
How about drinking to the success of getting him?

204
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:11,631
Gosh.

205
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:14,731
I would like to say sure.

206
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,631
But we have to start questioning him.

207
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,331
Of course...

208
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:25,231
The Nagakuras went through a series of misfortunes, so far.

209
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,631
It's good that the case is closed,

210
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:29,331
rather, I'm glad that the case is closed.

211
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,931
A series of misfortunes?

212
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:36,031
You're talking about his son, Eiji Nagakura, right?

213
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,731
What a terrible thing to happen...

214
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,131
"Jewel Thief Commits Suicide"

215
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,631
"Robbery-murder Case in Shoujin"

216
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:43,131
"Death of Suspect, Half Year Case Closed" -I'm sure it's her.

217
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:47,531
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty and comes to see him.

218
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,231
And Eiji.

219
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,231
That fellow is not my son!

220
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,331
Keep that in mind!

221
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:54,931
Well, anyway...

222
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,931
After all of these things, ten days ago,

223
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:02,531
they renovated the rooftop after 30 years,

224
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:07,331
and they moved the whole house to the present site.

225
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,331
What? Moved the whole house?

226
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:11,031
What is it?

227
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,431
They moved that big house?

228
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:14,531
Is that so?

229
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,831
That explains why the foundation looked so new.

230
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,431
It sure surprised me but that's not all.

231
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,631
What?

232
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:29,331
Mr. Nagakura's house was here until a half month ago?

233
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,731
Yes.

234
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:34,131
The house was moved from here to where it is now.

235
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:36,931
This Otozawa house had been over there

236
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:38,631
and they exchanged the houses all together.

237
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:40,931
Why did they do that?

238
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,531
They said they did it for complete reversal or something.

239
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,831
It's probably because

240
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,831
the place over there commands the best view in the whole village.

241
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,131
As a representative of promotion for World Heritage application,

242
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,731
he managed to do it.

243
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,431
At least some people say so.

244
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,631
Well, anyway, they really look alike.

245
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,031
Yes. It sure is identical.

246
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,931
You mean to Mr. Nagakura's house?

247
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:07,131
At night, you could easily mistake one for the other.

248
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:09,331
If the motive of the culprit had nothing to do

249
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,731
with the application for the World Heritage...

250
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:18,231
In other word, if the culprit simply made a mistake

251
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,231
and took one house for another...

252
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,831
-Hey, Conan! -Did anything happen?

253
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,831
Conan!

254
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:31,731
Stop running.

255
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,331
Just as I thought.

256
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,231
They are identical inside, too.

257
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,331
When he was in Mr. Nagakura house,

258
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:38,731
he was somewhere around here looking for...

259
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,831
I've found it.

260
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:48,931
What did you find?

261
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,331
-Great! -Terrific sight to see!

262
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:56,731
Beautiful, very beautiful..

263
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:57,731
Are these...

264
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:00,331
Yeah. Most likely...

265
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:02,031
Hello?

266
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:04,031
Oh, it's you, Shinichi.

267
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,231
What's that?

268
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,831
The jewelry stolen in the robbery case...

269
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,931
Where are they now?

270
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,131
They are still missing.

271
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:17,531
Police concluded that they had been disposed of a long time ago.

272
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,731
Speaking of missing...

273
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:24,231
When he made his escape from the shop,

274
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,731
he took a jeweler hostage

275
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:29,031
and the hostage is still missing.

276
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,931
They say that the hostage was killed

277
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:33,131
when he was no longer of any use, but...

278
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,131
It's hot!

279
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,731
It's not... It was...

280
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:38,531
It's nothing. Nothing to do with you at all.

281
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,131
Are you all right, Conan?

282
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:51,531
That thing, you know?

283
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:54,731
We'd better give them to the police.

284
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:56,331
Keep your voice down.

285
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,831
Well, thanks, ladies.

286
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:02,031
Come. Here you go.

287
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,731
As I expected. The real culprit is that person.

288
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,231
The person who will show up at that place tonight.

289
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,431
"Otozawa"

290
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,131
I've found it.

291
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:27,431
We've been expecting you, mister.

292
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,331
We've been waiting for you.

293
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,331
And you can't run away this time.

294
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,231
What're you talking about?

295
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:38,531
I just couldn't sleep and took a walk

296
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:42,131
but got lost because the house was so much alike...

297
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:44,931
Then, what's with that jewelry you have?

298
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:48,131
You broke into the jeweler's shop in the neighboring town

299
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,631
and took them, didn't you?

300
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:51,331
I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,331
You can't fool us.

302
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,531
You are the principal culprit of the jewelry robbery

303
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,931
who killed Mr. Eiji Nagakura

304
00:15:57,931 --> 00:16:00,431
and made it look like suicide. Am I right?

305
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,131
Mr. Eiji...

306
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:05,631
seems to have been in debt.

307
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,931
That's why he was made to watch out for the robbery.

308
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,931
So it was you alone who carried out the jewelry robbery

309
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,631
and murdered the watchman.

310
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:16,031
I know nothing.

311
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,331
What you're talking about is beyond...

312
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,231
When fleeing,

313
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:21,531
you visited this Onizawa village

314
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,531
as guided by Mr. Eiji.

315
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:24,631
You hid the jewelry you robbed

316
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:28,331
in the Otozawa house which was vacant at that time.

317
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:30,131
You never dreamed that the house itself

318
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:34,731
would be moved in half a month.

319
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:38,331
Then, you pinned the guilt on Mr. Eiji alone,

320
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,331
and killed him making it look like he committed suicide

321
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:44,631
Then you came here as a tourist

322
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:47,131
to retrieve the jewelry you hid.

323
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,831
That's the jewelry in your left hand, isn't it?

324
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:54,831
That night,

325
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,531
you assumed Mr. Nagakura was away,

326
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:00,631
you were looking for the jewelry but were discovered

327
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,631
so you got out through the window.

328
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:04,731
That means that you didn't break into the house

329
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,331
but were inside from the beginning.

330
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:11,731
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagakura saw you when he was on watch.

331
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,931
When he hurriedly rushed back to his house...

332
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,531
The watch record shows that something went wrong

333
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:26,731
with the order in which the seals were stamped.

334
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:31,531
I'm just an old man and a tourist.

335
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:34,131
I just found this by accident.

336
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:38,731
I knew that you're not just an old man and a tourist

337
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:41,731
when I noticed the mark around your right eye.

338
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:45,931
That mark is the trace of a loupe

339
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:51,131
The jeweler who was taken as hostage, murdered, and missing

340
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:54,431
is none other than you, Mr. Sakaki.

341
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,631
Surely...

342
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,631
But after the culprit commits suicide,

343
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:02,531
I was scared and hiding myself

344
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,831
and now I conjured up enough courage to come out

345
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,131
to retrieve the jewelry and return it.

346
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:12,131
What if I were to say that, kids?

347
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:13,831
So, you admit that

348
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,731
you were looking for the jewelry on the third floor

349
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,031
of Mr. Nagakura's house last night.

350
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,931
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

351
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:24,431
When you went out through the window

352
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,931
and injured Mr. Nagakura, is that right?

353
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,031
Oh, that!

354
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:31,131
I was drunk with sake and sound asleep.

355
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:33,631
So I couldn't possibly have done it.

356
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:36,731
Then, when and where did you get the rash?

357
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,331
When you both were drinking sake together,

358
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,931
both of you had no rash or reddening on you.

359
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,231
The people who were with you at dinner

360
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:50,031
can easily prove it.

361
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:52,931
But the red rash on both of you is evidence

362
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,931
that you were at the same place at the same time.

363
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,531
Mr. Nagakura!

364
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,231
Call an ambulance!

365
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,431
That is the only place in the village that has lacquer trees.

366
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:07,131
There is no other place.

367
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,331
That settles it.

368
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:12,231
You! Who are you to press on me?

369
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:15,431
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

370
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:18,231
-We're the Youth Detective Squad! -We're the Youth Detective Squad!

371
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,431
You are talking rubbish! Get off!

372
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:23,131
I'm not going to get caught for all the effort I made.

373
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,231
Give me back...

374
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:32,331
Give me back my Eiji...

375
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:33,531
Give him back!

376
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,531
Keep off, you... Get off of me.

377
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,131
Okay! Now!

378
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,231
Get this!

379
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:52,131
It hurts...

380
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:14,031
You've done well, Ayumi!

381
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:16,731
That's what real acting is, Ayumi.

382
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:18,831
You are worthy of an Academy Award!

383
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,431
What?

384
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:21,731
Act?

385
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,831
I was just standing there all the time.

386
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,831
But, then what was that...

387
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:29,931
Look at that!

388
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,431
Mist, it's the mist.

389
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:37,431
Look closely.

390
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,531
-What? Mist? -Mist?

391
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,431
The Brocken spectre

392
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:45,831
The one you look from time to time

393
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:47,531
out of an airplane or mountain top.

394
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:51,231
I see. That's what it was!

395
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:55,731
Yes.

396
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:58,831
There is nothing in this world

397
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:00,331
that you cannot solve by logic and reasoning.

398
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:32,431
Mr. Mouri!

399
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,031
Thanks for the call yesterday.

400
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:42,631
What? Call?

401
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:45,731
Thanks to you, we got to check him before he tried to escape.

402
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,931
As expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

403
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:51,631
I, Tamekichi Matsushiro, really respect you, sir.

404
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,131
Respect!

405
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:55,331
That's right.

406
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:58,931
Sure thing...

407
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,831
I wish I could see you even if just for an instant.

408
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:09,731
I don't mind if you're a ghost, Mami.

409
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:14,631
Hurry up, Ayumi.

410
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:16,231
We're going.

411
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:18,731
I'm coming up.

412
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,431
Wait for me!

413
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:24,331
And the two houses that have been moved were returned

414
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,731
and placed back to where they originally were.

415
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:30,231
After recovered from his injury,

416
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:32,031
Mr. Nagakura thought that the spirit of the girl,

417
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:35,131
who had been a close friend of his deceased son,

418
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:38,731
had revealed the truth about the death of his son.

419
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:39,931
Of course.

420
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:43,731
I, the detective of logic and reasoning, didn't believe it.

421
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:46,531
Two months later,

422
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:50,831
Onizawa village was officially registered as a World Heritage.

423
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,431
"Next Episode" -Detective is my business

424
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:58,031
and I fight against the darkness of the society they call crime.

425
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:00,431
What's pops doing, anyway?

426
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:03,231
Kill?

427
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:06,931
If he doesn't do it means he is sloppy or...

428
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:08,731
Or he foresaw that somebody else would find it

429
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,631
at the sound of telephone bell,

430
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:13,031
and hid it here on purpose.

431
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:14,431
Three...

432
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:16,831
3,000 yen! That could be...

433
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,831
Next Conan,

434
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,831
"Forgotten Cell phone (Part 1)"

435
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:25,058
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:26,758
"Telephone number"

437
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:27,758
Question!

438
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,458
What is the name of the coffee shop below the Mouri Detective Agency?

439
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,758
Are you the young lady who just poured beer?
