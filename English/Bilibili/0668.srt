1
00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:03.324
Ran and I accompanied

2
00:00:03.324 --> 00:00:07.924
Pops to the wedding eve of Pop's old friend.

3
00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:09.624
Amidst the gala atmosphere,

4
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:13.424
the bride, Hatsune Kamon goes off to the nail salon

5
00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:15.724
to prepare for her wedding.

6
00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.624
But two hours later,

7
00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:21.124
Hatsune leaving behind the word "Goodbye"

8
00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:23.524
is found burned to death

9
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.324
along with an explosion that occurred in the parking lot.

10
00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.024
At first, it was thought that she had committed suicide

11
00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.624
but, from Hatsune's fake nail with a piece of skin on it,

12
00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:34.024
that was found at the scene,

13
00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:35.424
DNA that was virtually matched that of Mr. Raita Banba,

14
00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.724
the groom was found.

15
00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:40.824
Mr. Banba denies committing the crime.

16
00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.324
He claims that the waiter

17
00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.824
who had secretly been seeing Hatsune is suspicious

18
00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:47.624
but, he turns out to be a detective that was hired by Hatsune.

19
00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:51.224
He seems to have been checking on Mr. Banba's daily affairs.

20
00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:55.724
His testimony was backed up by the detective that Mr. Banba had hired.

21
00:00:55.724 --> 00:01:00.324
Mr. Banba agrees to go through another DNA test.

22
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.324
The vivid coloured memories of summer.

23
00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:09.424
Solve mysteries all season round.

24
00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:11.124
The past of the two tells of everything.

25
00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:13.224
What is the proof that he is not the culprit?

26
00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:14.824
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.024
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:19.424
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:06.923 --> 00:03:11.823
"Wedding Eve (Part 2)"

30
00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:13.923
Inspector Megure.

31
00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.723
There's one door at the back of this restaurant

32
00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:20.723
that leads to the parking lot.

33
00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:24.823
But, since it was raining hard when the incident occurred,

34
00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:26.723
that door seemed to have been locked.

35
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:28.123
Which means in order to get out of the restaurant,

36
00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:31.423
there was no other way than to go through the front entrance?

37
00:03:31.423 --> 00:03:32.523
Yes.

38
00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:36.823
But if so, I'm sure that one of the guests would've remembered.

39
00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:39.323
Are there no other way in and out of the restaurant?

40
00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:42.423
You could try to make it out of the window of the toilet.

41
00:03:42.423 --> 00:03:44.923
But, outside the window the road is not paved

42
00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:47.023
and there's a big puddle,

43
00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:48.423
so if anyone did pass through here,

44
00:03:48.423 --> 00:03:52.823
there should be some traces of footprints left behind.

45
00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:56.823
At the time of the incident, it seems to have been windy,

46
00:03:56.823 --> 00:03:59.323
because Hatsune's umbrella was found

47
00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:02.023
blown to the very end of the parking lot.

48
00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:03.523
Wind?

49
00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:05.823
Come to think of it,

50
00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:08.323
when we got to this restaurant it was pretty windy.

51
00:04:08.323 --> 00:04:13.623
And? Do you detectives have anything that comes to mind?

52
00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:14.823
Not in particular.

53
00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:18.023
When I told him that she was secretly seeing some other man,

54
00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.023
he was quite out of sorts

55
00:04:20.023 --> 00:04:22.023
but recently it seems that he was more concerned

56
00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:25.823
about the fact that she was secretly talking to somebody over the phone.

57
00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:30.023
Well, but she was only probably contacting this guy.

58
00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:34.823
Oh, no. I contacted her only by mail.

59
00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:36.623
The only time I met her outside was just once,

60
00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:38.323
the time you saw her with me.

61
00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:42.923
Only there was just one time when her face clouded.

62
00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:45.623
-Her face clouded? -Yes.

63
00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:47.223
I'm a detective so,

64
00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:50.523
I was checking in detail on Banba.

65
00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.923
Then I found out about something.

66
00:04:53.923 --> 00:04:55.423
Found out about something?

67
00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:59.423
He and Hatsune were both rescued from a hotel fire.

68
00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:01.523
Although both their identities weren't known,

69
00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:04.223
they were raised in the same church.

70
00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:08.923
Which means that both their parents died in the fire?

71
00:05:08.923 --> 00:05:14.023
It seems to have been a pretty big fire with many casualties,

72
00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:15.523
and both of them were babies.

73
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:19.023
Which means they were childhood friends?

74
00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:23.723
No, he seems to have been adopted right away

75
00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:27.723
but she was raised in church for some time.

76
00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:30.723
But, why did her face cloud because of it?

77
00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:31.923
I wonder...

78
00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:34.923
She said that she would check on things herself later.

79
00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:38.623
Ran.

80
00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:41.323
How tall was Hatsune?

81
00:05:41.323 --> 00:05:44.023
She was shorter than you, wasn't she?

82
00:05:44.023 --> 00:05:45.123
Yes.

83
00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:49.223
Besides, she was wearing boots with pretty high heels.

84
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.823
I think she was much shorter than me,

85
00:05:50.823 --> 00:05:53.423
like about 5 feet or so.

86
00:05:53.423 --> 00:05:56.723
But why are you asking me something like that?

87
00:05:56.723 --> 00:06:01.623
The average height of Japanese women is about 5 feet 3 inches or so.

88
00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:04.223
Inspector Megure!

89
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.323
Did you get results for the DNA test already?

90
00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:11.423
No, not yet.

91
00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:13.023
According to forensics,

92
00:06:13.023 --> 00:06:15.423
one fake nail is missing from the body.

93
00:06:15.423 --> 00:06:18.823
So, that's the one that was found near the car.

94
00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:22.623
No, if that's included, then there are two missing in total.

95
00:06:23.623 --> 00:06:27.623
Then did the remaining one burn in the car to ashes?

96
00:06:27.623 --> 00:06:29.723
Or...

97
00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.123
Conan.

98
00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:36.123
The place I found the umbrella?

99
00:06:36.123 --> 00:06:38.123
What's asking something like that going to do?

100
00:06:38.123 --> 00:06:41.023
Pops Kogoro told me to go and ask you.

101
00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:45.023
It was hooked on to this car at the end,

102
00:06:45.023 --> 00:06:47.323
like this...

103
00:06:48.323 --> 00:06:50.623
Hey, you! Kid!

104
00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:52.723
If the fake nail were to have come off,

105
00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:55.123
it may have fallen into the inside of the umbrella

106
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.723
and if it would've been blown away together...

107
00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:02.023
Here it is.

108
00:07:02.023 --> 00:07:04.523
Moreover the tire and the body of the car served to rain-proof it,

109
00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:06.523
so it's virtually not soiled at all.

110
00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:08.423
Are the things on the tip of the nail...

111
00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:10.423
skin and blood?

112
00:07:12.823 --> 00:07:16.523
Sir, there is a fake nail under this car.

113
00:07:18.023 --> 00:07:20.923
It probably belonged to the lady who died,

114
00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:22.623
so can you pick it up carefully?

115
00:07:22.623 --> 00:07:25.623
Please check the things on the tip of the nail very carefully.

116
00:07:25.623 --> 00:07:26.623
Yes.

117
00:07:30.123 --> 00:07:36.123
I'm sure that this will clarify things of who killed her

118
00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:38.523
and if it's just as I've deducted...

119
00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:44.723
the sad truth that you didn't want to know about

120
00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:48.023
will be exposed in broad daylight.

121
00:07:53.523 --> 00:07:56.723
Darn. What the heck is going on anyway?

122
00:07:56.723 --> 00:07:57.923
Darn!

123
00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:03.023
Hey. It's about time you really cool it, Banba.

124
00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:06.823
You understand that you're in a grave predicament, don't you?

125
00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:09.023
Hatsune burns to death in a car

126
00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:11.223
that is parked in the parking lot of this restaurant,

127
00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:13.723
and on the fake nail that was found near that car,

128
00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:16.923
skin that looked to be like that of the culprit was stuck to it.

129
00:08:16.923 --> 00:08:20.923
The DNA of the skin virtually matched the DNA of your hair

130
00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:24.223
that was found on the hairbrush.

131
00:08:24.223 --> 00:08:25.423
Under these circumstances,

132
00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:27.623
it can't be helped if you emerge as the culprit.

133
00:08:28.723 --> 00:08:33.123
So now, did you ever let anyone use that hairbrush?

134
00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:34.423
Use?

135
00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:38.123
Like when a friend spent the night at your house or something.

136
00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:39.323
I wonder...

137
00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:41.723
I don't remember any such time.

138
00:08:41.723 --> 00:08:45.823
Hatsune and I have been living together since six months ago.

139
00:08:45.823 --> 00:08:48.223
A detective from somewhere that Hatsune invited over

140
00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:51.223
may have used it when I wasn't home, though.

141
00:08:51.223 --> 00:08:55.623
It's true that I'm a detective that was hired by her

142
00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:58.023
but I never went to your house.

143
00:08:58.023 --> 00:09:02.323
I can't really say if that detective thing is for real or not too.

144
00:09:02.323 --> 00:09:03.823
Now that Hatsune's dead,

145
00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:07.023
there's nobody who can prove that.

146
00:09:07.023 --> 00:09:09.823
If that detective was so sharp

147
00:09:09.823 --> 00:09:11.323
as to divert the attention of the detective that I hired

148
00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:12.823
so that he got away each time he was tailed,

149
00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:15.323
it would've been easy for him to plant somebody else's hair

150
00:09:15.323 --> 00:09:17.623
on my hairbrush when he came over,

151
00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:21.423
and set me up for something I didn't do.

152
00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:22.523
Oh, no.

153
00:09:22.523 --> 00:09:25.423
I'm not the spy type.

154
00:09:25.423 --> 00:09:27.923
Well, I guess not.

155
00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:31.423
I just got a report on the DNA test result.

156
00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:34.323
I has been confirmed that the hair

157
00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:37.123
on the hairbrush was unmistakably Mr. Banba's!

158
00:09:37.123 --> 00:09:38.923
No joke...

159
00:09:38.923 --> 00:09:39.923
Yes.

160
00:09:39.923 --> 00:09:42.623
Which means that...

161
00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:45.323
You who mistook me, a detective that was hired by Hatsune,

162
00:09:45.323 --> 00:09:47.923
for her lover,

163
00:09:47.923 --> 00:09:49.223
from feelings of jealousy that aroused

164
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:50.623
started harboring murderous intent.

165
00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.923
Therefore, there's no other option than to think that you waited for her

166
00:09:52.923 --> 00:09:55.023
to come back at the parking lot of this restaurant,

167
00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:58.523
shoved her into the car and burned her to death.

168
00:09:58.523 --> 00:09:59.923
Why you...

169
00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:01.123
Then,

170
00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:03.723
you will voluntarily come to the station with me?

171
00:10:03.723 --> 00:10:05.423
Wait, I tell you.

172
00:10:05.423 --> 00:10:07.223
Mouri, do something, will you?

173
00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:09.523
There's not much I can do.

174
00:10:09.523 --> 00:10:11.523
-Mouri... -Let's go.

175
00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:13.423
Okay.

176
00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:17.123
I re-parked the police car a little distance from here

177
00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:19.123
and since it's raining you may get wet without an umbrella.

178
00:10:19.123 --> 00:10:20.623
It started raining again?

179
00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:22.823
Yes, and pretty hard too.

180
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.223
I don't really mind getting wet, though.

181
00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.123
No kidding, it's raining hard.

182
00:10:33.123 --> 00:10:35.023
Are sure it's okay, Banba?

183
00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:36.123
Really?

184
00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:41.523
Are you sure you want to leave this restaurant?

185
00:10:41.523 --> 00:10:44.423
Even if I don't want to, I've got no choice, do I?

186
00:10:44.423 --> 00:10:46.223
At this rate, I've got to go to the police

187
00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:47.723
to have them prove my innocence.

188
00:10:47.723 --> 00:10:48.723
I see.

189
00:10:50.823 --> 00:10:54.823
If so, you're not the culprit.

190
00:11:12.315 --> 00:11:13.415
Dad.

191
00:11:13.415 --> 00:11:15.315
Hey, hey, Mr. Mouri.

192
00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:18.815
Although he did agree to going voluntarily to the station,

193
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:22.215
that doesn't mean that he's not the culprit, does it?

194
00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:23.715
He may be thinking that even if he's interrogated

195
00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:28.115
he won't get caught if he doesn't confess to his crime.

196
00:11:28.115 --> 00:11:30.015
No way.

197
00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:32.615
Then please try to recall the circumstances

198
00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:36.315
when Hatsune's car went up in flames.

199
00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:38.815
The door leading to the parking lot from this restaurant

200
00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:41.915
was locked because it was raining.

201
00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:44.015
Going in and out from the toilet window is also unthinkable

202
00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:46.815
because below that window there was a big puddle,

203
00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:50.315
but the culprit's footprints weren't found anywhere near it.

204
00:11:50.315 --> 00:11:54.315
If so, the only way out is through the front entrance of the restaurant.

205
00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:58.615
But, if the main character of today's wedding party leaves the restaurant,

206
00:11:58.615 --> 00:12:01.415
somebody is bound to have seen him, right?

207
00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:06.515
My deduction would be it wasn't that nobody noticed,

208
00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:08.615
it's just that no one was aware.

209
00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.115
Just what do you mean?

210
00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:14.115
He disguised himself in the men's room.

211
00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:16.215
He had hidden the clothes to carry out his plan,

212
00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:17.715
in the men's room beforehand.

213
00:12:17.715 --> 00:12:19.615
For example, if he wears a knitted cap

214
00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:22.015
and long windbreaker,

215
00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:24.615
nobody would notice that it's him.

216
00:12:24.615 --> 00:12:28.415
More so because he greeted everyone at the beginning of the party

217
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:32.015
and imprinted what he was wearing onto their memory.

218
00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:36.615
Then what about the call I made to Hatsune

219
00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:38.615
just before the car went up in flames?

220
00:12:38.615 --> 00:12:41.915
Hatsune was crying and saying goodbye, you know?

221
00:12:41.915 --> 00:12:44.815
Did you really call her just before the car went up in flames?

222
00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:46.115
What?

223
00:12:46.115 --> 00:12:50.415
Isn't it a fact that you waited for her in the parking lot in disguise,

224
00:12:50.415 --> 00:12:54.815
and called her after she got out of the car?

225
00:12:56.015 --> 00:12:58.315
You did this so that you could pass her out

226
00:12:58.315 --> 00:13:01.115
while she was distracted by your phone call.

227
00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:04.015
Although she put up a bit of a fight,

228
00:13:04.015 --> 00:13:07.115
you somehow managed to shove her into the car.

229
00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:09.815
After setting fire to the car,

230
00:13:09.815 --> 00:13:11.615
you rushed back to the restaurant,

231
00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:14.015
and changed into your original clothes in the men's room.

232
00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:17.815
Then later, you deliberately punched me, the waiter, and hurt yourself

233
00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:21.115
in order to hide the place that she scratched you.

234
00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:24.715
All you needed to do next was to conspicuously pretend to call her

235
00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:26.315
and make the people around you think that

236
00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:29.415
she was saying what sounded like a suicidal message.

237
00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:31.215
You look out the window

238
00:13:31.215 --> 00:13:34.915
and make the others realize that her car is burning.

239
00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:37.915
This way, you end up being the poor man

240
00:13:37.915 --> 00:13:41.915
who beloved woman committed suicide.

241
00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:43.615
You were lucky that just about that time,

242
00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:47.015
the spray can in the car exploded.

243
00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:48.715
That's all nonsense.

244
00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:51.515
Hatsune really said goodbye to me.

245
00:13:51.515 --> 00:13:53.415
Please check Hatsune's cell phone.

246
00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.815
It should be in the car.

247
00:13:55.815 --> 00:13:58.615
We did find a burnt black cell phone.

248
00:13:58.615 --> 00:14:00.715
But, even if we're able to recover the data,

249
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.915
we can't retrieve what kind of conversation you had...

250
00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:05.115
But, if we go by that deduction the clothes

251
00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:06.615
and things that were used for the disguise

252
00:14:06.615 --> 00:14:08.715
should've been found in the toilet.

253
00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:11.715
He probably shredded it and flushed it down the toilet.

254
00:14:11.715 --> 00:14:13.515
Of course that's possible with a knitted cap.

255
00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:17.815
As for the flimsy nylon windbreaker, it's easy to shred.

256
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.415
What about the shoes?

257
00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:23.715
You can shred shoes that easily.

258
00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:27.815
There's no need to change shoes.

259
00:14:27.815 --> 00:14:29.915
If you keep on walking without stopping

260
00:14:29.915 --> 00:14:32.815
nobody can tell what kind of shoes you're wearing.

261
00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:36.015
In fact, the shoes he was wearing

262
00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:38.215
was sneakers that are sold everywhere.

263
00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:39.915
Okay, Banba.

264
00:14:39.915 --> 00:14:41.615
Take off your sneakers and show him

265
00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.815
the sole of your sneakers.

266
00:14:45.015 --> 00:14:50.515
That's the proof that'll show that you're not the culprit.

267
00:14:52.915 --> 00:14:54.315
There is something that looks like cream

268
00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:55.615
in the groove of the sole of his shoe.

269
00:14:55.615 --> 00:14:57.115
What?

270
00:14:57.115 --> 00:14:59.715
I think that's chocolate cake.

271
00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:03.115
Mr. Banba was stepping on the cake that fell to the floor.

272
00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:05.315
When did he step on it?

273
00:15:05.315 --> 00:15:09.315
Before Hatsune left this restaurant to go to the nail salon.

274
00:15:09.315 --> 00:15:11.415
I see.

275
00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:15.215
If he walked in that heavy rain at the time the incident happened,

276
00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:18.415
most of this cream would've come off.

277
00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:21.415
More so, if he rushed back to the restaurant

278
00:15:21.415 --> 00:15:22.615
after committing the crime.

279
00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:23.915
I see.

280
00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:26.815
In other words, he didn't leave the restaurant.

281
00:15:26.815 --> 00:15:28.215
No.

282
00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:31.415
In fact, when I first saw that,

283
00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:34.615
I thought it was foul play that Mr. Banba was putting on.

284
00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:38.615
That he somehow managed to change his shoes

285
00:15:38.615 --> 00:15:41.115
to show me the cream on the sole of his shoe as proof

286
00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:44.915
that he didn't leave the restaurant.

287
00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:46.415
But, he coincidentally stepped on the cake

288
00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:50.615
after that young detective dropped it

289
00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:53.115
and Banba never said a word

290
00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:55.815
about the cream on the sole of his shoe to me.

291
00:15:55.815 --> 00:15:58.915
And more so, he's about to leave the restaurant in the rain

292
00:15:58.915 --> 00:16:02.915
and would be getting rid of very important evidence.

293
00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:07.715
That's what convinced me that the cream wasn't fake,

294
00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:11.715
but rather, evidence that would prove Banba's innocence.

295
00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:13.615
Mouri.

296
00:16:13.615 --> 00:16:16.215
But, what about the DNA?

297
00:16:16.215 --> 00:16:19.015
On the tip of her fake nail was the DNA of a piece of skin

298
00:16:19.015 --> 00:16:21.515
that virtually matched his.

299
00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:25.015
That's only proof that he was near her at that time, is it not?

300
00:16:25.015 --> 00:16:26.815
Didn't it ever dawn on you

301
00:16:26.815 --> 00:16:30.415
that the skin on her fake nail may have been her own?

302
00:16:30.415 --> 00:16:32.815
Just what do you think you're saying?

303
00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:34.015
Like I mentioned earlier,

304
00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:35.415
unless you're blood related,

305
00:16:35.415 --> 00:16:38.815
it's impossible that genetic information would virtually match.

306
00:16:38.815 --> 00:16:42.815
Currently, the chances of another person with the same type DNA appearing

307
00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:45.815
is one in 4 trillion 7,000 billion people.

308
00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:50.115
Besides, women don't have the Y chromosome that men have,

309
00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:52.015
so it's readily obvious.

310
00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:53.615
It could be that they said virtually

311
00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:55.315
because the skin in question,

312
00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:57.315
was contaminated by rain and soil,

313
00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:59.815
making it hard to determine the gender, right?

314
00:16:59.815 --> 00:17:01.215
Even so...

315
00:17:01.215 --> 00:17:03.115
Are you saying that such a twosome coincidentally ran into each other,

316
00:17:03.115 --> 00:17:06.815
fell in love and decided to marry each other?

317
00:17:06.815 --> 00:17:09.915
They may have run into each other coincidentally,

318
00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:13.515
but I think it was inevitable that they were attracted to each other.

319
00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:16.015
Because they were twins.

320
00:17:17.615 --> 00:17:18.715
Twins?

321
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.715
Banba you guys were saying,

322
00:17:32.715 --> 00:17:35.615
our birthdays are the same,

323
00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:36.915
our blood types are the same,

324
00:17:36.915 --> 00:17:40.215
and that you can tell what the other is thinking at times.

325
00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:41.615
Yes.

326
00:17:41.615 --> 00:17:43.615
But, that's not enough to make us twins.

327
00:17:43.615 --> 00:17:46.115
You may not have known about it,

328
00:17:46.115 --> 00:17:48.515
but when Hatsune and you were babies,

329
00:17:48.515 --> 00:17:50.815
both of you were rescued from a hotel fire

330
00:17:50.815 --> 00:17:55.115
and raised at a church with no way to find who you both were.

331
00:17:56.215 --> 00:17:58.215
A hotel fire?

332
00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:01.415
I see, since your parents burned to death in the fire,

333
00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.715
no one knew you were twins.

334
00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:07.615
Do twins have the same DNA?

335
00:18:07.615 --> 00:18:10.415
It seems to be so for identical twins,

336
00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:11.615
but, in that case

337
00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:15.315
if I remember it's supposed to be two boys or two girls.

338
00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:18.615
It happens quite rarely.

339
00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:21.815
When the chromosomes of the fertilized egg,

340
00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:23.115
before splitting into two is XY,

341
00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:26.015
in the case of men, during the split,

342
00:18:26.015 --> 00:18:30.015
the Y chromosome on one side because of some factor is lost,

343
00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:32.415
resulting in XO and XY,

344
00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:33.415
in other words,

345
00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:38.815
identical twins of different genders are born.

346
00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:40.915
Hey, hey. You're joking, right?

347
00:18:40.915 --> 00:18:43.215
That Hatsune and I are twins.

348
00:18:43.215 --> 00:18:46.215
Do you know how tall she was?

349
00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:49.115
She said she was a bit more than 4 feet.

350
00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:51.815
She was bothered about being short.

351
00:18:51.815 --> 00:18:54.815
If so, the possibility is high.

352
00:18:55.915 --> 00:18:58.715
The female side of identical twins of different genders,

353
00:18:58.715 --> 00:19:02.615
because of Turner's syndrome tend to be short.

354
00:19:02.615 --> 00:19:04.515
But...

355
00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:08.615
why was Hatsune's own skin on her fake nail?

356
00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:10.815
Can't you tell, Banba?

357
00:19:11.815 --> 00:19:13.515
After hearing from the young detective

358
00:19:13.515 --> 00:19:17.215
that you and her were rescued from the same fire,

359
00:19:17.215 --> 00:19:20.515
if she told him, "I'll check further for myself."

360
00:19:20.515 --> 00:19:22.315
Then I can't think of anything else she would do

361
00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:25.015
than to get a DNA analysis to clarify

362
00:19:25.015 --> 00:19:27.915
whether you're both really twins.

363
00:19:27.915 --> 00:19:31.415
It is most likely that when she got back here from the nail salon,

364
00:19:31.415 --> 00:19:33.315
and got off the car,

365
00:19:33.315 --> 00:19:36.115
she got a call from the place that was doing the analysis

366
00:19:36.115 --> 00:19:39.215
and was told the result...

367
00:19:39.215 --> 00:19:43.315
that you and Hatsune could never get married

368
00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:46.015
because you were blood related twins.

369
00:19:47.215 --> 00:19:48.915
No...

370
00:19:48.915 --> 00:19:51.915
No way...

371
00:19:55.715 --> 00:19:58.515
Her skin was probably on the fake nail

372
00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:01.415
because shocked at the result,

373
00:20:01.415 --> 00:20:05.915
she scratched her face and cried to the point her fake nail came off.

374
00:20:05.915 --> 00:20:09.715
The fake nail that fell inside the umbrella she was holding then,

375
00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:14.415
that was blown away is being checked now.

376
00:20:14.415 --> 00:20:16.915
Once the result is out I'm sure...

377
00:20:19.815 --> 00:20:21.515
Yes, Megure here.

378
00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:25.915
I see.

379
00:20:25.915 --> 00:20:27.015
I got it.

380
00:20:27.015 --> 00:20:31.215
Did the result of the other fake nail come out?

381
00:20:31.215 --> 00:20:33.415
Yes, on that fake nail,

382
00:20:33.415 --> 00:20:35.415
not only was there a blood stain on it,

383
00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:37.215
it was virtually not contaminated at all.

384
00:20:38.315 --> 00:20:41.915
It was a perfect match with Mr. Banba's DNA.

385
00:20:41.915 --> 00:20:45.315
All except for the part that indicates the gender.

386
00:20:45.315 --> 00:20:49.615
It seems to have match with her DNA

387
00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:51.715
that they barely managed to get from her corpse,

388
00:20:51.715 --> 00:20:54.215
so the skin on the fake nail was concluded to be hers too.

389
00:20:54.215 --> 00:20:57.315
Then, she committed suicide after all?

390
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:02.215
That's the only thing thinkable.

391
00:21:02.215 --> 00:21:06.415
But that company sure called her at a bad time.

392
00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:10.115
Since they heard that the two were getting married tomorrow,

393
00:21:10.115 --> 00:21:12.515
they wanted to let them know before it was too late

394
00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:15.015
and before a fatal mistake was carried out.

395
00:21:16.015 --> 00:21:19.215
Hatsune...

396
00:21:20.715 --> 00:21:23.315
Hatsune!

397
00:21:25.715 --> 00:21:27.815
Hatsune!

398
00:21:32.715 --> 00:21:37.515
Mr. Banba's scream tore through the sound of the rain and echoed.

399
00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:43.815
We can't tell why she chose to burn herself to death,

400
00:21:43.815 --> 00:21:49.915
but maybe she wanted to go back in order to do things all over again.

401
00:21:49.915 --> 00:21:54.415
Into the flames that lead them to this tragic destiny.

402
00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:21.915
What? You want to be my disciple?

403
00:23:21.915 --> 00:23:24.715
You mean of this great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

404
00:23:24.715 --> 00:23:26.215
Yes, of course.

405
00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:28.315
I decided I wanted to start from scratch

406
00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:30.515
when I heard your great deduction the other day

407
00:23:30.515 --> 00:23:32.215
and strongly felt how immature I still was.

408
00:23:32.215 --> 00:23:35.415
That's why I want to work part-time near you

409
00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:39.315
and accompany you on the cases you go to handle.

410
00:23:39.315 --> 00:23:43.015
But I don't take disciples...

411
00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:48.015
As tuition...

412
00:23:48.015 --> 00:23:51.215
I don't mind paying I plan to pay you.

413
00:23:51.215 --> 00:23:53.015
No joke?

414
00:23:54.715 --> 00:23:56.915
You're hired!

415
00:23:56.915 --> 00:24:00.915
From now on, call me "master", understand, Amuro?

416
00:24:00.915 --> 00:24:02.315
Master Mouri.

417
00:24:04.515 --> 00:24:07.215
A bit of trouble again.

418
00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:12.815
Kyodo.

419
00:24:12.815 --> 00:24:17.015
Come to think of it, that lady's name was Nanami Kyodo.

420
00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:20.515
You mean Ran's senior in the Karate club.

421
00:24:20.515 --> 00:24:24.115
How is it, going guys? You want to go on an adventure?

422
00:24:24.115 --> 00:24:25.515
-Yes! -Yes...

423
00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:29.315
Ai's not here.

424
00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:31.715
I'll be right there!

425
00:24:31.715 --> 00:24:34.215
Stay here, Ayumi!

426
00:24:34.215 --> 00:24:35.515
Next Conan,

427
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:39.515
"The Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 1)".

428
00:24:55.315 --> 00:24:57.415
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:57.415 --> 00:24:59.415
"Mirror".

430
00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:01.215
The dark tower sort of gives me the chills.

431
00:25:01.215 --> 00:25:02.515
Like in the mysteries of ancient times?

432
00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:04.515
Just like your deductions, pops.
