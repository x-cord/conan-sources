1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,924
We got involved in the murder case

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:06,024
that occurred on the Bell Tree Express.

3
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:10,224
The case was solved.

4
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:13,924
Furthermore, it was found that the man with the burn

5
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:17,524
who was going around on board the train was Vermouth.

6
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:20,024
In the meantime, a dark shadow closed in on Ai

7
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:22,724
who had returned to an adult's form after drinking the antidote.

8
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:33,924
Just as expected of Hell Angel's daughter.

9
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:36,224
You look alike.

10
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,324
How do you do?

11
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,524
Bourbon...

12
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:48,424
This is my code name.

13
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,324
With the cooperation of my mother, Subaru Okiya,

14
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:54,624
and the helping hand from Thief Kid who came to check the place out,

15
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:58,724
we succeeded in protecting Ai from those guys. However...

16
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:11,324
If so, couldn't you have explained it beforehand?

17
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:12,624
Well...

18
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:14,324
I was really surprised.

19
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,324
I desperately fled into Room B of carriage number 7

20
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,124
because the door was open,

21
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:21,024
then found your mother waiting for me there.

22
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:23,324
And she told me, "Leave the rest to me".

23
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:25,624
I had no idea of what was going on!

24
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:28,624
On top of that, you came into that room later,

25
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:30,924
and pushed your cell phone on me.

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,124
Was I supposed to tell you

27
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,124
that Thief Kid disguised as you

28
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:38,624
and confronted the Black Organization?

29
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:41,824
I thought that was some kind of joke.

30
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:46,024
Come on now. We weren't really sure

31
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,924
if those guys were coming on board the train or not.

32
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,424
I was off my guard as well,

33
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:53,724
until I got a text mail from Mom saying that Vermouth

34
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,324
was on board the train too.

35
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,124
It also seemed that our room was tapped,

36
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:01,724
so I couldn't really say anything.

37
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:04,824
It seems that Subaru who hacked your cell phone,

38
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,824
saw the mail from Vermouth.

39
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:10,524
He thought it might be too dangerous, so he went to get you.

40
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:11,724
Hacking?

41
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:14,324
Just as expected, it was lucky

42
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:17,124
that you ran into Room B of carriage number 7.

43
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,824
Who is that guy named Subaru, anyway?

44
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:24,524
Why is he living together with your mother at your place?

45
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,924
It's okay. He's on our side.

46
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:33,124
Besides, Mom only comes around on weekends every so often.

47
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,024
Well, the best result we achieved this time was finding out

48
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,924
that Amuro who did part-time work at the Poirot coffee shop

49
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:44,524
is Bourbon, one of their comrades.

50
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:48,524
Come to think of it, it seems he hasn't been to work

51
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:50,724
because he's not in good health.

52
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:51,824
Yeah.

53
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:54,924
It's a mystery as to why he did part-time work at Poirot,

54
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,524
but I don't think he'll be back anymore.

55
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:02,624
Fortunately, it seems that he thinks you died in that explosion.

56
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:05,724
I was thinking that if he dared to come back,

57
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:09,324
then I would check him out this time.

58
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,924
At any rate,

59
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,224
if you ever do something like this without telling me again,

60
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:14,624
you won't get away with it!

61
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:16,624
I feel so deceived,

62
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:21,124
and I'm not happy or anything, you know!

63
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,424
Can I take that as

64
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:25,224
your way of saying "thank you"?

65
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:27,224
How stupid!

66
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:34,524
Hey. Ai is sort of a sweet-and-sour type.

67
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,924
Which part of her is sweet?

68
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,324
Aim for a 100% solution.

69
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:42,824
Clear all mysteries and codes.

70
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,824
When I came to, I was in a locked room.

71
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,524
What on earth happened?

72
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:48,124
He sees through the one and only truth.

73
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,124
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

74
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:52,524
His name is Detective Conan!

75
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:40,288
"Conan in a Locked Room"

76
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:46,888
Well. Thank you so much!

77
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,288
You invited us over to your villa in Izu Highland to compensate

78
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:55,688
for putting us through all the hassle on the Bell Tree Express.

79
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,788
Moreover, it's located near a tennis court,

80
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,388
so we can play all we like.

81
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:00,988
Furthermore...

82
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:08,488
I heard there are loads of young and healthy female tennis players, too!

83
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:11,188
It's just too much.

84
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:14,388
Well, it rained the last time we came.

85
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:18,388
You didn't have to compensate for anything though.

86
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,488
I figured I'd bring you along while I was at it,

87
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:24,488
but I'm actually going for a special tennis training!

88
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,788
A special training?

89
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:29,388
Is there a tournament coming up?

90
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:34,288
An event bigger than a tournament happened to come up.

91
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,388
At any rate, take a look at this.

92
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:39,688
How are you doing, Sonoko?

93
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,488
-It's Mr. Kyogoku! -I've recently

94
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:45,288
started incorporating tennis into my karate training.

95
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,888
I would like to have a match with you

96
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:49,188
the next time I return to Japan.

97
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,488
That's why I've decided to send you a video mail.

98
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:54,788
What's this? It's an invitation to a tennis date!

99
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:56,488
Yes, it is.

100
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:58,188
We're going to be lovey-dovey on the tennis court!

101
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:00,088
Just the two of us!

102
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:03,788
But if so, you don't have to train, do you?

103
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:06,788
Don't be silly. I'm a member of the tennis club.

104
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:10,488
I can't afford to lose easily to an amateur!

105
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:14,088
If so, why not ask one of your tennis club seniors to help you?

106
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:17,988
Those weaklings are of no use.

107
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:22,588
But neither Dad nor I is good enough to teach you, Sonoko.

108
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:24,488
Don't worry about that!

109
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,488
Right, Pops Kogoro?

110
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:31,088
Yeah! I got you a special and talented coach!

111
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,688
A special coach?

112
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:52,988
Why...

113
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:55,288
Wow, Amuro!

114
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,888
He's just like Nadal.

115
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:59,888
Well, I've been hearing that since I was in intermediate school.

116
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,688
How embarrassing.

117
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:04,388
Why is he here?

118
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:07,388
I was surprised when the manager of Poirot told me

119
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:10,088
that you have won the Junior Tournament.

120
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:13,388
Well. Right after that, I hurt my shoulder,

121
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:16,688
so I can't serve as many times as before.

122
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:19,988
But it won't hurt to teach someone.

123
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:22,088
I'm counting on you!

124
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,388
Are you sure it'll be okay?

125
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:27,688
I heard that you weren't in good health.

126
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:30,588
I just caught a slight summer cold.

127
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,788
I'm going back to do part-time work at Poirot starting next week.

128
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,388
What?

129
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,388
Anyway, there are so many spectators here.

130
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,088
I think they mistakenly thought

131
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,688
that a pro tennis player or something have come.

132
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,888
Let's start with serve training, then.

133
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:47,388
-Okay. -Back down. The ball may be dangerous.

134
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,988
No, what's dangerous is not the ball...

135
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,788
-Look out! -Huh?

136
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:56,288
Conan!

137
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:02,088
No, Ran. Stay away from him!

138
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:05,788
He's a member of...

139
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,488
the Black Organization.

140
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:13,988
Well, he seems to be conscious.

141
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,788
It's just a light concussion.

142
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,788
But if his hands or legs go numb

143
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:20,588
or if he feels nauseated,

144
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:23,188
take him to the hospital and have him checked.

145
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,288
Yes.

146
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:27,388
-Goodbye, then. -Thank you very much.

147
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:30,088
I'm glad that it wasn't anything serious.

148
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:32,188
Where is this?

149
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:35,088
It's not Sonoko's villa, is it?

150
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,588
It's the villa of the one who hit you by her racket.

151
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:39,188
"Kotone Momozono (21), University Student" -This is my villa.

152
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,688
I'm so sorry, little boy.

153
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,688
My racket slipped from my hand because of perspiration.

154
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:44,488
That's why I told you

155
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:47,588
"Machi Umejima (22)" -to wrap a grip tape firmly around the handle.

156
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,988
"University Student" -You sweat a lot.

157
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,688
How disappointing.

158
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:54,888
If the battery of my cell phone wasn't dead,

159
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,488
I would've taken a footage of that shocking moment

160
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:00,488
and uploaded it on the web.

161
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:01,488
"Saburo Ishiguri (21), University Student" -The title would be,

162
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:05,288
"A Killer Racket Attacks A Young Boy: A Failed Killer Serve"!

163
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,188
A child has gotten hurt, you know!

164
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,688
What do you think you're saying?

165
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,188
It's only a joke.

166
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:12,888
I just wanted to soften up this heavy atmosphere.

167
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,688
"Noboru Takanashi (22)" -Uryu could've died

168
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,088
"University Student" -because of that joke, you know?

169
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,488
Don't get angry.

170
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,988
We're gathering here after a long time

171
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,888
to celebrate Uryu's birthday, aren't we?

172
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:27,488
That's right. Let's not fight.

173
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,588
Uryu will be sad to know this.

174
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,488
-Yeah. -Yeah.

175
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:37,388
Since the boy is safe now,

176
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:40,888
everyone, would you like to have a group match with us?

177
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:43,488
Since we have exactly four men and women here,

178
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:46,088
how about a mixed doubles?

179
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:48,288
I don't mind.

180
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:51,188
Well, a match is also training, you see.

181
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:52,788
I don't mind playing,

182
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,988
but can we take a break before we start?

183
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,288
True. I'm all sweaty from the morning match, too.

184
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:01,788
I'm hungry, too.

185
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:05,588
Come to think of it, I'm hungry, too!

186
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,788
I'm hungry as well.

187
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,588
We're having cold Chinese noodles for lunch.

188
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:10,988
Would you all like some?

189
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,888
Yes! We'll have some!

190
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:15,488
-But is it okay? -Yes!

191
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,688
It's a token of my apology for hurting him.

192
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:20,388
Then, I guess I don't want any after all.

193
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,788
I'm going to eat the left-over ice cake from last night in my room.

194
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:24,788
I tell you.

195
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:26,788
You'll become even fatter

196
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:28,188
if you keep eating things like that!

197
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,188
Don't worry, don't worry!

198
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:35,388
Okay. We'll go and help prepare lunch,

199
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:38,588
so wait for us here, Conan.

200
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,288
Ran.

201
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,988
The person who carried me in here...

202
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,188
Was it...

203
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:45,888
It was Amuro.

204
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,588
He treated you precisely until the doctor came.

205
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:51,188
He was so reliable.

206
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:57,288
Conan?

207
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,588
Where are you?

208
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,688
Conan?

209
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,088
That brat said that

210
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,588
he was going to Mr. Ishiguri's room.

211
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,388
Then, the two of them went upstairs together.

212
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:09,788
It seems that

213
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:12,288
the air conditioner of this living room isn't working well.

214
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:14,788
Come to think of it, it really isn't too cool here.

215
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,088
Conan.

216
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:24,088
Your lunch is ready.

217
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:25,888
Conan?

218
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:28,588
It seems he's asleep, so why not let him be?

219
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,988
Missing lunch won't kill him either.

220
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,388
That's true.

221
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:35,788
It seems that the air conditioner of this room is working, too.

222
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:39,488
Are you joking?

223
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:42,688
You mean Ishiguri still hasn't come out of his room?

224
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,288
It's already past 3.00 pm, you know?

225
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:45,888
We don't have all day.

226
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:48,288
I knocked on the door many times.

227
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:51,388
But it seems he locked the door and fell asleep.

228
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,888
What was that sound just now?

229
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:59,788
It sounded like it came from Ishiguri's room.

230
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,488
I wonder if something happened?

231
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,388
What was that sound?

232
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:13,588
It sounded like something fell.

233
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,688
Anyway, it's really hot in this room.

234
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,788
I wish he'd keep the air conditioner on

235
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,188
because I'm sleeping here.

236
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:22,688
What...

237
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:29,388
Hey, Kotone. You have the spare key, don't you?

238
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,488
The thing is, the spare key to Ishiguri's room

239
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:35,888
has been missing since last night.

240
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,188
We've got no choice.

241
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:39,288
It may be a bit dangerous, but I can try

242
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:41,688
entering Ishiguri's room from the veranda.

243
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,188
If the window's open, I can get inside.

244
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,588
Even if it's not, I can check out the inside of the room.

245
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:51,188
True. We've done that before, too.

246
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:53,388
But there is quite a large gap,

247
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,388
so it's impossible for me to do.

248
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:59,388
It's because you don't like high places, Machi.

249
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,788
If you don't mind, would you like me to unlock the door for you?

250
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:07,488
I'm pretty good at things like that.

251
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:20,188
It seems to have opened.

252
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,088
You're fantastic, Amuro!

253
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:24,788
You're just like Thief Kid!

254
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,688
I have a friend who works at a security company,

255
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:30,588
and he secretly taught me how to do this.

256
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:32,788
It's a great skill to have

257
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,288
for a detective who has to search for things.

258
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:42,988
Something is blocking the door from opening.

259
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,288
Conan?

260
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,988
Don't open it!

261
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,588
Don't open the door.

262
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:56,688
Because the thing that's blocking the door

263
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,388
is Mr. Ishiguri's corpse.

264
00:14:58,388 --> 00:14:59,788
What?

265
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,788
Moreover, this is...

266
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:06,988
an impossible crime.

267
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:11,088
Don't tell me it's another locked room murder?

268
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:24,664
What? A locked room murder?

269
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,464
-Do you mean this is... -Yeah.

270
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:29,764
The door which is the only entrance to this room

271
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:32,864
is blocked by Mr. Ishiguri's corpse.

272
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:36,464
Also, all the windows were locked from the inside.

273
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,964
Conan, I know you love mysteries

274
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:41,964
because you're influenced by Mr. Mouri,

275
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:46,564
but on this racket under the hips of the corpse wearing a tennis wear,

276
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:49,864
there are marks that look like scratch bumps.

277
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,064
And on the shelf near the head of the corpse,

278
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,064
there are similar scratches, too.

279
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:56,264
And if the copper flower vase

280
00:15:56,264 --> 00:16:00,964
that is on the shoulder of the corpse was on that shelf...

281
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:02,364
Mr. Ishiguri could be practicing swinging his racket in the room

282
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:04,864
and his hand slipped...

283
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,064
and the racket that came flying hit the shelf.

284
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:12,964
When he bent over to pick up the racket that fell...

285
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:19,364
After that, he struggled and lay on his back,

286
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:20,764
then died in front of the door.

287
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:22,664
Maybe it's best to think of it this way.

288
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,264
But if that's the case,

289
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:28,264
the racket should've been closer to the shelf.

290
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:30,664
And if he struggled and ended up lying on his back,

291
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:31,964
I don't think such a heavy looking vase

292
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:35,164
would be on his shoulder, right?

293
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:37,964
Besides, on the floor right below the shelf,

294
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,764
there seems to be a big dent

295
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,764
that was probably made when the vase fell.

296
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:46,664
I woke up because I heard a loud bang.

297
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,864
If that was the sound of the vase falling,

298
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:51,464
then this certainly isn't an accident.

299
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:54,064
-Why is that so? -That's because...

300
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:55,764
right after it happened,

301
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,564
I tried touching the dead body and vase,

302
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:02,164
but the blood on both was already dried out.

303
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,264
That means

304
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:08,064
Mr. Ishiguri was already dead before I heard the sound,

305
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:10,064
and the vase on the shelf that already had blood on it

306
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,264
fell to the floor, right?

307
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,864
That... That's true.

308
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,564
It seems that the loud sound

309
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:19,564
was also heard by the other people who were at the villa.

310
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:22,464
Maybe you should confirm it with them.

311
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:24,164
But...

312
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:27,964
if that's true, why did this vase with blood on it fall?

313
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,464
Beats me.

314
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:32,764
Besides, how was Mr. Ishiguri's body,

315
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:35,564
being as fat as he is, moved near the door

316
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,864
without even leaving a trace on the floor?

317
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:40,964
I still don't know yet.

318
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,664
But the one who did that

319
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:45,664
came to this villa along with Mr. Ishiguri,

320
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,464
and is on the other side of the door.

321
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:52,764
There's no doubt that the culprit is among the three.

322
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:59,764
I think that's what Pops Kogoro would say!

323
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:04,364
So Mr. Mouri is here, too!

324
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,864
By the way, Conan.

325
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:08,664
Why are you in this room?

326
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:11,364
That's because this afternoon, a racket came flying at me

327
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:12,664
at the tennis court.

328
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,864
And I fainted after being hit by it.

329
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,464
The person who threw the racket

330
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,864
is a woman called Kotone Momozono.

331
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:25,164
And this is her villa.

332
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:29,164
Since her place was right near the tennis court,

333
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:32,464
I was brought here. After the doctor examined me,

334
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:36,564
I slept on the bed in this room for a while.

335
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,564
At first, I was lying down on the sofa in the living room,

336
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:42,864
but the air conditioner in that room wasn't working well,

337
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,064
so I moved to this room.

338
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:47,164
But it seems that the air conditioner here

339
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,064
isn't working well either.

340
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,064
I don't know why,

341
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,564
but when I got up, it was turned off.

342
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:56,964
I see.

343
00:18:56,964 --> 00:19:00,564
By the way, what's that thing

344
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:02,864
on the table over there?

345
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,264
It's an ice cake.

346
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:05,464
It was left over from last night,

347
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:09,064
and Mr. Ishiguri said he was going to eat it for lunch.

348
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,964
But it has already melted.

349
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:15,064
What? A locked room murder?

350
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:17,864
The corpse was blocking the door,

351
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,964
so why is it murder?

352
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:22,264
But...

353
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,764
Conan who was in the room

354
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,164
said that he heard a loud sound,

355
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:29,164
and touched corpse and vase right away,

356
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:31,564
but the blood on both were already dried.

357
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:33,164
I tell you.

358
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:36,464
You can't tell whether he heard it right after the sound was made.

359
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:41,364
Because this brat was still groggy from a concussion.

360
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,764
Besides, we don't even know

361
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:47,064
if the sound was that of the vase falling.

362
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,264
A culprit committing

363
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:50,664
an intellectual crime like a locked room murder

364
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,064
wouldn't commit a crime that's so obvious.

365
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:55,064
Maybe it's because the culprit

366
00:19:55,064 --> 00:20:00,364
was confronted by two big miscalculations.

367
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,764
The first one is that Conan

368
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:06,264
was wrapped up in a blanket and was sleeping in the room.

369
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:12,264
The other one was that I ended up opening

370
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:15,064
the door of that room that was locked.

371
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:18,664
Without these two occurrences,

372
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:21,964
someone would've had to use the veranda

373
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:23,664
and check on Mr. Ishiguri who didn't come out of his room

374
00:20:23,664 --> 00:20:26,064
through the window.

375
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,664
By the time police arrived at the scene, cracked the window

376
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,564
and came into the room,

377
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,064
it wouldn't be unnatural

378
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,364
if the blood was dried because of the heat.

379
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,764
Besides, even if someone were to break in

380
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:41,464
through the window right after the corpse was found,

381
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,964
they would focus on whether Mr. Ishiguri was dead or alive,

382
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,264
and not on whether the blood had dried or not.

383
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:51,364
And when the police arrived, all that'd be reported

384
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:54,064
was that he was bleeding from his head

385
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:56,364
and was lying on the floor in front of the door.

386
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:59,064
Good work, Conan.

387
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:04,064
By the way, who is he?

388
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:07,764
He's my number-one disciple detective.

389
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:10,264
Number-one disciple?

390
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:11,364
Yeah.

391
00:21:11,364 --> 00:21:15,164
He said he was impressed by my superb deductions.

392
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:16,864
Mr. Mouri.

393
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:18,064
Although I just decided by myself,

394
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:22,164
I thought that I was your number one disciple.

395
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,564
Is... Is that right?

396
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:27,464
At any rate, why don't we ask the three people

397
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,964
who were at this villa to begin with?

398
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:32,664
They're the only ones

399
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:35,064
who have motives for this murder.

400
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:37,264
No... No way.

401
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:41,164
Are you saying that the culprit is among us?

402
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:44,864
Right. It's very likely that there's no mistake about it.

403
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:48,664
But the problem lies in that locked room.

404
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:53,864
How on earth did the culprit come out of that room?

405
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:58,264
All the windows were locked from the inside

406
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:00,664
and Mr. Ishiguri's corpse was in front of the door

407
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,664
that opens inwardly.

408
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:08,564
Even if the culprit had the spare key for the door,

409
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:11,664
the corpse was lying in front of the door,

410
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,664
so the culprit wouldn't be able to open it.

411
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:17,964
On the other hand, it would've been impossible for the culprit

412
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:21,964
to place Mr. Ishiguri's body in that position after leaving the room.

413
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,564
Darn it.

414
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:26,264
How on earth did the culprit do it?

415
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,364
The spare key for Mr. Ishiguri's room hasn't been found yet.

416
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,464
What was the key like?

417
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,964
It seems to be similar to this key

418
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:03,064
found in the pocket of the corpse.

419
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:07,564
For some reason, it seems there was water in the vase.

420
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:10,364
I see. That's how it is.

421
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:13,664
The culprit ingeniously used an object that doesn't keep its form

422
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:16,764
and completed the locked room murder.

423
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:20,864
Next Conan, "Bourbon Solves the Mystery"

424
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:40,064
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,464
"PET bottle"

426
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,264
I should be careful of Amuro?

427
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,064
Because he's Shinichi's rival?

428
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:47,364
No.
