2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,500
Sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,130
Mom!

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,450
Hello.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,230
Took you long enough.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,680
How long were you going to make us wait?

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,010
I've been holding off from drinking beer.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,510
I didn't ask you to do
that. Drink if you want to.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,890
I found time in my busy schedule for this.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,940
What was that?!

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,900
What?

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,860
Jeez... Stop!

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,160
You're not here to argue today.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,740
You're having a meeting.

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,000
Then this is none of my business.
You don't need me here.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,410
Hey, one large beer!

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,130
Yes, sir.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,900
I'll be leaving immediately, so water's fine.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,250
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,250
Mom!
Yes, ma'am.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,390
I'm sorry, but I really don't have the time.

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,670
But I'll be there tomorrow.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,010
Yes! Isn't that great, Conan-kun?

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,140
Huh? Uh, yeah.

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,060
Like I said, this is none of my business.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,200
No one asked you to come.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,570
You don't have to force yourself.

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,220
Dad!

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,700
I think I'll be able to make the
panel during the second half.

30

32
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,950
So you'll be going onstage together.

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,870
Yeah, that's right.

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,330
Thank you for waiting.
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,680
It's the best. Right, Dad?
Thank you for waiting.

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,760
It's the best. Right, Dad?

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,860
Either way, I'm the star of the show.

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,450
Yes, yes. Congratulations on your lecture.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,330
I should go.

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,980
Oh, no!

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,050
Huh? Someone was just looking over here.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,160
Thanks. See you later.

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,540
They're gone?

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,040
Did I imagine that?

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,950
Right now at this moment,
light pierces the darkness!

47
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,840
Overcome all limits with
your cool reasoning skills!

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,510
The old man's invited to give a lecture.

49
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,700
What will happen when
the couple goes onstage?

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,290
Always determining the one truth

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,930
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,310

Mori Kogoro-sama

65
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,718
If you get drunk, you won't
be able to give your talk.

66
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,828
Don't worry.

67
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:07,818
It'll be more fun with a little drink in me.

68
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:13,318
Well, it doesn't seem
like he'll need me today.

69
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,878
I hope not.

70
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:15,748
Ready, and...

71
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,248

72

Congratulations!

73
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,548
You kids sure are considerate.

74
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:25,428
Make sure you study all this
great detective's secrets.

75
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:25,758
Congratulations to the Sleeping Kogoro
From the Detective Boys

76
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,778
Okay!

At least, we wish we could,
Congratulations to the Sleeping Kogoro

78
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:33,228
but we actually have to
leave before it starts.

79
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:34,518
What?

80
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:38,448
Sorry, mister. We already had plans.

81
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,628
We're going to see a soccer game.

82
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:46,028
But as long as it doesn't go into overtime,
we'll be able to return during the panel.

83
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:50,658
Conan-kun and Ai-chan, are you going, too?

84
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,048
That's right.

85
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,538
Sorry.

86
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,108
Fine. Go on, then.

87
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,418
You don't have to force yourselves to return.

88
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,258
Don't say that.

89
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:05,228
Mom will be on the panel, too.

90
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,758
We'll be waiting for you to come back.

91
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:09,598
Okay!

92
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:14,708

99
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:28,668

Huh?

111
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,898
Say hello.

112
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,728
Oh, I'm sorry!

113
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:06,648
I'm a huge fan of yours,
so I'm a nervous wreck.

114
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,528
N-Nice to meet you!

115
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:13,928
I see, I see. The pleasure's all mine.

Shall we have a battle of the detectives?

121
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:35,418
I think I recognize that guy.

122
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:38,248
That's actor Inokoshi Kenichiro-san.

123
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:41,068
He's famous for playing police
officers and detectives.

124
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:44,688
That's right. They call him
the king of mystery shows.

125
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:48,528
For some reason he's always solving
mysteries under precipitous circumstances.

126
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,318
Hey, he can hear you.

127
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:54,158
I hope you'll appear in one of
my shows sometime, Mori-san.

my shows sometime, Mori-san.

130
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,998
We could even start a new series.

131
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:02,918
What? Me, on TV?

132
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,908
I'm joking.

133
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,018
That was a joke?

134
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:11,258
You can't be serious!

135
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,888
I refuse to accept this hall!

136
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:17,188

What's with the cheap décor?

140
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,318
There, and there, and there!

141
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,138
Taking pride in an outdated
management philosophy

142
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:37,478
that kept us in the red died off with
my father—rather, my predecessor.

143
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:42,208
Reizei-san, our contract
with you has already ended.

144
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:43,988
Please leave.

145
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,588
What was that?!

146
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,178
Please, calm down.

147
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:55,678
"Keep doing that, and you won't have a
single person open their heart to you."

148
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,898
Who the hell are you? Move!

149
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:02,438
You're not familiar with my catchphrase?

150
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:05,688
It's even better when
there's a camera around.

151
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:12,868
Isn't this actually your job, Tsukinogi-chan?

152
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:15,988
You're as useless as ever.

153
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:21,618
I quit working security because of you.

154
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,328
What does that mean?

155
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,778
Who knows?

156
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:29,608
Sounds like there's bad
blood between those two.

157
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:30,758
Yeah.

158
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:35,678
Are you all right?

159
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:39,178
Why don't you rest over there.

160
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,118
Would you like something to drink?

161
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,728
I'll help.

162
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,418
Thank you.

163
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:53,878
But I'm fine. You should be helping him.

164
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:54,658
What?

165
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:57,838
What's going on?

166
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,868
Dad, you've had too much to drink!

167
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,668
Yikes.

168
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,288
Did something happen?

169
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,918
Conan-kun, help me.

170
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,408
Okay.

171
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:09,688
Mister, be careful.

172
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:11,598
What? What happened?
Mister, be careful.

173
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:12,548
Come on, this way.
What? What happened?

174
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:15,018
Is he okay? He's blind drunk.

175
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:16,708
I'm worried.

176
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,058
Me, too.

177
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:23,508
Everyone, I'm sorry for the commotion.

178
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:25,228
We'll be starting shortly.

179
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,568
Please relax in your
changing rooms until then.

180
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,018
Ujimori, show them the way.

181
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:30,808
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:34,948
20 Minutes Before the Lecture

183
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,978
Huh? Where's Conan-kun?

184
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:43,668
Do you suppose he's still with Ran-san?

185
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:46,868
If we don't hurry, the game will start.

186
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,948
Fine. I'll go get him. You go on ahead.

187
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:55,248
Dad! Wake up, Dad!

188
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,018
Huh?

189
00:10:56,668 --> 00:11:00,638
What? Did the great Sleeping...

190
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:06,398
I mean, did I impress you with
my detective skills again?

191
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:10,448
Huh? I don't remember anything...

192
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,398
Dad!

193
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:22,818
I thought so.

194
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:26,788
Why don't you use your voice changer
to give the lecture yourself?

195
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,458
That's not funny.

196
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:33,878
What was that?

197
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:35,298
Conan-kun.

198
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:42,338
What happened?

199
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,098
Inokoshi Kenichiro-sama

200
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,068
Over there...

201
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:49,688
That's...

202
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:53,918
I-Inokoshi-san asked me to bring him coffee.

203
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:57,388
I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer.

204
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,488
Looks like it's stuck on something.

205
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,118
Judging by this pool of blood...

206
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:09,108
Yeah, definitely.

207
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:14,758
Let's see.

208
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,268
The window to Inokoshi-san's
changing room is...

209
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,258
That one.

210
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:30,808
I knew it.

211
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:34,688
The body's keeping the door
shut instead of the lock.

212
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,668
In other words, this is...

213
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:39,618
Yeah.

214
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:43,448
It's a locked room mystery.

215
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,168
What?

216
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,135
What should we do? The game is starting.

217
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:03,215
Why not let the police handle it?

218
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,535
I know, but...

219
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,095
Inspector.

220
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,495
There may be some clues still.

221
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,395
Please be careful.

222
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,005
I know.

223
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,695
Takagi, Chiba.

224
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,545
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:21,655
Look. Even the great detective is awake.

226
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:23,785
Yeah.

227
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:37,425
The victim is actor Inokoshi
Kenichiro-san, forty-eight years old.

228
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:42,825
He was scheduled to appear on the
panel after Mori-san's lecture,

229
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:45,935
and was waiting alone in this changing room.

230
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:50,055
We're waiting on the autopsy
for the cause of death,

231
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:53,625
but it was likely blood loss due
to being stabbed in the heart.

232
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:55,945
Also, look at this.

233
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,395
This was in the left breast
pocket of the victim's jacket.

234
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,285
A pocket watch, huh?

235
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:06,055
The blade of the weapon
matched the damaged section.

236
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:10,335
It's safe to assume it was damaged when
the victim was stabbed in the heart.

237
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:15,145
Which means the time of death was 2:50.

238
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,585
The problem is...

239
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:18,675
Yes.

240
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:21,845
This was a locked room.

241
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:25,925
Under the circumstances, the door
only opened about five centimeters,

242
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:28,105
making it impossible for
anyone to enter or exit.

243
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,855
The window we broke was locked
from the inside as well.

244
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:35,605
There were no signs that
it had been tampered with.

245
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:42,115
So how did the culprit leave the
room after killing Inokoshi-san?

246
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:46,555
At the very least, one
thing is clear, Inspector.

247
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,625
And what's that?

248
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:53,045
Takagi, how's the security
here at HISHIDA Hall?

249
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:56,925
We confirmed with the security staff

250
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:01,555
that aside from the front entrance
and reception desk of the hall,

251
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:05,175
all entrances including emergency
exits are locked from the inside.

252
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,575
According to the reception desk,

253
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,435
around 2:50 when the crime took place,

254
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:13,925
only three children left the building.

255
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,375
Children?

256
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,815
Those were our friends.

257
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,065
They left because they had someplace to be.

258
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:23,575
Don't interfere with the investigation.

259
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:27,955
Which means no one else entered or left.

260
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:33,585
This wasn't the work of
an outsider, Inspector.

261
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,465
I-I see. In other words...

262
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:37,505
Yes.

263
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:41,465
The culprit is among the staff, guests,

264
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:45,845
and 300 audience members inside
HISHIDA Hall right now.

265
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:47,845
Wh-What?

266
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:52,785
Well, that's for sure.

267
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,235
It was enough to leave a mark on the floor,

268
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:08,325
so they must have dragged the
chair with the body sitting in it.

269
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:12,175
So how did they get out afterwards?

270
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:23,095
Something was pressed against it.

271
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:27,075
I see. So that's how it is.

272
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:29,475
I see.

273
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,505
This is how they created the locked room.

274
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,225
Who is this person?

275
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:39,425
What's that? What about the locked room?

276
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,665
What's going on?

277
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,615
Start the event.

278
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,475
It's ten minutes past.

279
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,555
Is the Sleeping Kogoro not coming onstage?

280
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:54,745
Delay Mori-kun's lecture an hour?

281
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:55,975
Yes.

282
00:16:55,975 --> 00:17:00,325
We were thinking about making that
announcement to the audience.

283
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,255
What are you talking about?

284
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,925
This is a murder.

285
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,925
The lecture should be canceled immediately.

286
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:13,515
But only the owner Hishida can make
the decision to cancel the event.

287
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:15,135
Then...

288
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:19,145
Where is this Hishida-san?

289
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:22,755
Actually, I haven't seen her.

290
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,905
I've been looking for her.

291
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,905
What?

292
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:34,665
But fortunately, the great detective
Mori Kogoro-sensei is here.

293
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:38,615
I trust he'll solve the case before long.

294
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,295
Well, actually...

295
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:45,215
As the president of the company running the
event, I'd hate to leave things like this.

296
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,925
Please solve this case, Mori-sensei.

297
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,265
Let me handle this.

298
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:57,935
The great detective Mori Kogoro will
solve this case within an hour.

299
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,815
Mori-kun, you can't go promising that.

300
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:01,575
Excuse me!

301
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:05,695
Delaying the lecture an
hour may be the right call.

302
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:06,835
What?

303
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:12,735
If the event is canceled
and the audience leaves,

304
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:15,715
it could be disastrous if
the culprit is among them.

305
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:19,475
Y-You're right.

306
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,275
Fine.

307
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:26,715
If you're so sure about this,
Mori-kun, you must know who did it.

308
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,345
Of course. I've even solved the
mystery of the locked room.

309
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:32,345
R-Really?!

310
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:36,305
That's amazing. He truly
is a great detective.

311
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,905
He just spoke with them briefly.

312
00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:41,355
Yeah, he sure is.

313
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:45,625
Inspector, could you gather
all the concerned parties?

314
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,305
Got it. Takagi.

315
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:49,525
Yes, sir!

316
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:53,885
The locked room didn't use
a very complicated trick,

317
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:57,135
but I still don't know who did it.

318
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:00,915
And I'm worried that no one's seen the owner.

319
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,255
Yeah.

320
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,065
Before I explain my reasoning,

321
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,175
Chiba, have you checked everyone's alibi?

322
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,855
Yes.

323
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:18,875
I was able to confirm everyone's
alibi for 2:50, with one exception.

324
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,435
They were all gathered in the same place.

325
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,875
I see. Who's the one exception?

326
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,455
Reizei-san, the former
manager of HISHIDA Hall,

327
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:33,075
who was resting in his changing room alone.

328
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,455
Dad, d-do you think...?

329
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,725
Yes.

330
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:46,545
You did it, Reizei-san.

331
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:52,225
Your motive was the rage you
felt towards Inokoshi-san

332
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,095
after he brought you in line
like you were on a TV show.

333
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,725
Actually...

334
00:19:56,955 --> 00:20:01,475
And you created this locked
room using your cane.

335
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,665
Creating a locked room with a cane?

336
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,355
But how?

337
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,655
I'll show you.

338
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:17,615
This room is constructed exactly
the same as Inokoshi-san's room.

339
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:19,105
Takagi, Chiba.

340
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:19,995
Yes, sir.

341
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:39,975
You alone left the room

342
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:44,675
and removed your cane just
before the door closed.

343
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,355
I see.

344
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:52,575
I'm sure it would open
more if you pushed harder,

345
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,365
but a body is rather heavy.

346
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:00,615
It's enough to create a
quick and dirty locked room.

347
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,095
Well, yeah.

348
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,625
But...

349
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:06,495
Excuse me!

350
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:12,435
Earlier I took Reizei-san
to his changing room.

351
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,035
Oh, thank you.

352
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:18,765
He was exhausted, and he's elderly.

353
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:24,005
Wouldn't it have been difficult
for him to do all that?

354
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:24,815
What?

355
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,485
You're right.

356
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,545
Sitting that large a victim in the chair,

357
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:32,585
dragging it across the room,
leaning it against the door,

358
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:37,655
and supporting it all with one cane
would've been rather difficult.

359
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:41,775
You're right. I can't imagine him doing it.

360
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:50,665
Impressive, Detective. I am astonished.

361
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:56,755
What?

362
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:03,725
I knew it.

363
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:09,345
I knew you'd spot my cane trick eventually.

364
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:13,735
But I killed someone else.

365
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,235
What?

366
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,485
Wh-What?!

I wouldn't expect less from the
great detective Mori Kogoro.

388
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:31,468
Is that appropriate to say right now?
