1
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:03,424
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:05,324
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:07,124
The tension in the courtroom is rising.

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,124
What will happen to Pops' family and the couple's case?

5
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:02,037
Attorney Eri Kisaki, Ran's mother

9
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:03,837
accepts to defend the suspect of a murder case

10
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,937
that is in the charge of Reiko Kujo,

11
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:07,937
who is also known as the Madonna prosecutor.

12
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:12,437
Of all things the one who has

13
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:15,237
the key to the alibi of defendant Usami

14
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,937
who was charged with murder, is Pops.

15
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:22,337
And worse yet,

16
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:26,037
he was summoned to court as a witness for the prosecutor.

17
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:35,637
"Battle in Court, Kisaki vs. Kogoro (Part 2)"

18
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:38,937
"The Tokyo District Court"

19
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,837
Mr. Mouri.

20
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,337
Where and what were you doing

21
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,737
on the night the incident happened?

22
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,737
I was drinking sake at the restaurant

23
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,937
called Mimasu located in Haido-cho.

24
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:04,437
At there, you drunk two cups of Sake

25
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,437
and you fell asleep on the counter of the bar.

26
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,437
That's right.

27
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,437
Do you remember what time you got up?

28
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:13,937
It was 21:25.

29
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:16,737
How did you find out what time it was?

30
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:21,237
I got a call on my cell phone just as I was dozing off,

31
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:23,737
so the shopkeeper woke me up.

32
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,737
When I looked the watch on my cell phone, it showed 21:25.

33
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:32,937
And were there any other customers at that time?

34
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:35,137
I was there alone,

35
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:37,537
but since the reception of my cell phone wasn't too good,

36
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:40,537
I was heading outside

37
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:43,237
when a man came as I was going out.

38
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:45,737
Do you remember how he looked?

39
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,337
Of course.

40
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:51,037
It's that man over there, defendant Shinji Usami.

41
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:52,337
What?

42
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:55,937
What does this all mean?

43
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:56,937
Why would the prosecution

44
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,437
want to prove he alibi of the defendant?

45
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,237
I don't know.

46
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:05,237
I'm sure she's up to something though.

47
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:06,937
I was surprised because he took

48
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,337
the witness stand for the prosecutor,

49
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:11,137
but dad is on mom's side after all.

50
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,637
Yeah, I guess so.

51
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:15,437
For now, that is.

52
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:18,437
That's all for now.

53
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,337
You may cross-examine the witness now, counsel.

54
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,237
Thank you, sir.

55
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:25,437
All right, Mr. Mouri.

56
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:27,337
Do you remember until around what time

57
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:30,237
the suspect Mr. Usami was at Mimasu?

58
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,337
I'm sure he was there for 30 minutes,

59
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,837
so I think he stayed till about 22:00.

60
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:38,437
In other words, the suspect was at Mimasu from 21:30 to 22:00,

61
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:43,537
the hours that the victim is estimated to have been killed?

62
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,937
Well, I guess so.

63
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:50,137
That will be all.

64
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:54,337
-Which means that the witness... -Your honor.

65
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,837
May I ask one last question, your honor?

66
00:04:57,837 --> 00:05:00,537
-Granted. -Thank you.

67
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:02,937
Mr. Mouri.

68
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,537
You stated a while ago that you were awakened

69
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:09,237
by the owner of Mimasu after you doze off.

70
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:10,237
Yes.

71
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:15,037
Then, where was your cell phone at that time?

72
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,437
Here it comes!

73
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:22,137
Of course it was inside the inner pocket of my coat

74
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:25,037
that was on the clothes rack inside the counter.

75
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,937
Which means that

76
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,737
it would've been possible for someone to fool around

77
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:35,337
with the time display of your cell phone while you were asleep.

78
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,537
Let's say for example, the owner of the shop.

79
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:40,737
-No way. -Objection, your honor!

80
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,737
The remark the prosecutor just made

81
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:45,337
is mere speculation.

82
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:49,337
Prosecutor, please base your remarks only on facts.

83
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,437
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:54,837
Your honor, I would like to call on another witness,

85
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,537
the former wife of the defendant

86
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:59,337
as well as the owner of restaurant Mimasu,

87
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:02,337
Mrs. Masako Kameda.

88
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,137
She got us.

89
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:08,037
Ms. Kisaki...

90
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,437
It's my mistake for being overly concerned about his alibi

91
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,337
and failing to check into the details.

92
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:21,237
What on earth is going on, Conan?

93
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:24,437
So long as the cell phone wasn't in Pops hand,

94
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:27,437
the defendant's alibi is invalid.

95
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:31,337
In other words, someone could've fooled around

96
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,637
with the watch of his cell phone.

97
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,937
Call Pops at any time, then wake him up,

98
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:39,637
to make him confirm what time it is.

99
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:44,737
Next, all that has to be done is change the time back again

100
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,737
when Pops takes his eyes off the cell phone again.

101
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:50,737
It is possible for the owner of Mimasu to do that.

102
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,337
But...

103
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:56,937
Right. Your mom, just like you

104
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,637
was already under the impression

105
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:00,837
that the two were not on good terms with each other

106
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,437
so Ms. Kisaki didn't even think that the owner of Mimasu

107
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,237
would cooperate in establishing an alibi for the defendant.

108
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:07,937
But...

109
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:11,937
Mrs. Masako Kameda.

110
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:13,837
On the night of the incident,

111
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:16,237
didn't you change the time

112
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,237
on the cell phone of Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

113
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:25,437
Well?

114
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:27,737
By the way, if lie under oath,

115
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:30,737
you could be accused of perjury.

116
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,537
Masako?

117
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:37,837
It's just as...

118
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:39,837
It's just as you say, prosecutor.

119
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:45,837
Then, you admit to having changed the time

120
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:47,637
on Mr. Mouri's cell phone?

121
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,637
Yes.

122
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,837
What time was it actually when the defendant Usami

123
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:56,837
came to your shop as Mr. Mouri went out?

124
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:00,437
I moved the clock 30 minutes,

125
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:03,037
so I think it was about 21:55.

126
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,037
Your honor. The scene of the crime

127
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:08,937
and the shop of the witness is only about 10 minutes on foot,

128
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:11,037
which means the defendant had more than enough time

129
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:13,837
to carry out the crime.

130
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:16,437
Would the defense like to question the witness?

131
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:18,137
Just one question.

132
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,937
Masako.

133
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,737
When I asked you to talk to me before this trial,

134
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,337
if I remember correctly,

135
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:29,237
I'm sure you said you hated the defendant.

136
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,337
So why would you take on such a task

137
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:34,137
as making up and alibi for him?

138
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:37,337
I don't know.

139
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,137
That will be all.

140
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:48,237
"Tokyo Prison"

141
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,437
Mr. Usami.

142
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,837
Is what your wife testified in court true?

143
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:00,437
How strange, though.

144
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,337
If you asked your wife to make up an alibi for you,

145
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,937
why didn't you use it?

146
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:09,237
As I've already told you,

147
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:13,437
you've got to tell me the whole truth.

148
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:18,337
Otherwise, I can't go on defending you anymore.

149
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,337
I don't need anyone to defend me anymore.

150
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:22,937
Just what are you talking about?

151
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,237
I'm the one who killed Hirasawa!

152
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:28,237
Just hurry up and shove me into jail or whatever!

153
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,637
Yes, Mouri Detective Office.

154
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:41,737
Oh, Officer Takagi.

155
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,837
And how was it?

156
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,137
Yeah...

157
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,037
And what about Usami's current address?

158
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,737
Pops...

159
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:54,037
Yeah... Okay, I got it.

160
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:55,737
Thanks for everything.

161
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:58,637
I'll treat you to a drink later. Bye then.

162
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:04,437
Conan, I'm going to go out for a while.

163
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,237
Bye.

164
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,737
Police report on the Hirasawa case.

165
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,037
I thought so.

166
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:19,737
I'm back.

167
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,237
Huh?

168
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,937
Conan, where's dad?

169
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,737
Hey, Conan!

170
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:31,237
Iidako in his stomach?

171
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:32,537
What's this?

172
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,737
Hey, Conan!

173
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:40,337
"Usami's Condominium"

174
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,737
Where shall I start?

175
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:46,437
Pops.

176
00:10:49,237 --> 00:10:52,737
Conan? How come you're here?

177
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,637
Ran told me to keep an eye on you

178
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,237
so the prosecutor doesn't take advantage of you again.

179
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,237
Gosh, she's got to learn to trust her father a bit more.

180
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:04,037
Don't you got messing the place around too much.

181
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,237
Yes, sir!

182
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:17,237
So, he's Masaki.

183
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:21,437
What's this?

184
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:24,437
This is the match of Mimasu.

185
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:26,237
Why would something like this be here?

186
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:31,337
Pops, was there an ashtray in this room?

187
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,737
Huh?

188
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,337
Come to think of it, I haven't seen any.

189
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:37,837
Usami probably doesn't smoke.

190
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,937
But look, there's a match box here.

191
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:46,037
This is the match box of Mimasu.

192
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,637
If so, it's not odd that it's here.

193
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:51,437
But, wasn't he on bad terms with his wife?

194
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:53,337
Then why?

195
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,637
Married couples go through a lot of complicated feelings,

196
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,837
although it may be hard for a kid like you to understand.

197
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,737
Seriously.

198
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,337
This is...

199
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:33,545
Excuse me.

200
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,545
Is there iidako in the oden today too?

201
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,045
Hi, sonny.

202
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,245
Yes.

203
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:41,145
After all, it's one of the specialties of this shop,

204
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,345
so I can't do without it.

205
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,545
Do you like it, sonny?

206
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,945
Yes, because it's so delicious!

207
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,945
All right, then I'll give you some.

208
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,945
All right! Thank you!

209
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:52,745
You're welcome.

210
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:57,445
You've got that picture too, don't you?

211
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,545
-Huh? -I saw it in Mr. Usami's room, too.

212
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,345
I see.

213
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,645
What? Making him take the witness stand again?

214
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,845
Yes, he says he goofed it the last time,

215
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:15,145
so he'd like to be given a chance to make up for it this time.

216
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:17,545
But, with the alibi invalid and all,

217
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,845
what difference is Mr. Mouri standing witness going to do?

218
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:22,445
It seems to have something to do with the blank time,

219
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,045
that he talked about last time.

220
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:26,745
And he also said you'd understand if I show you this.

221
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,445
This is the match box of Mimasu, isn't it?

222
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,845
This is...

223
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,145
This and another thing.

224
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,445
He said take a good look at the contents

225
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:38,545
that was in the victim's stomach.

226
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:41,145
The contents in his stomach...

227
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:42,545
Ms. Kisaki...

228
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:46,545
"The 3rd courtroom"

229
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,145
Then, Mr. Mouri,

230
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,245
let me confirm what happened that night once again.

231
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:09,045
Around what time did you go to Mimasu?

232
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:11,845
About 19:30, like I always do.

233
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:14,445
And when did you doze off?

234
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,345
20:30.

235
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,945
In other words, you were sleeping from 20:30

236
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:24,145
to the actual time you were awakened at 21:55?

237
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,945
Yeah, I guess so.

238
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:30,345
Just what is Ms. Kisaki trying to get at?

239
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,245
I wonder. I guess she just being a bad sport.

240
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:34,545
Which means that

241
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,245
no matter what happened inside the shop at that time,

242
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,745
you wouldn't have noticed, right?

243
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,945
Just what are you trying to get at anyway?

244
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,945
Let's say, even if Mr. Usami were to have brought the victim

245
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:47,545
to the shop while you were asleep.

246
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,445
Objection, your honor!

247
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:52,845
That's just groundless guess work!

248
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:55,645
I do have something to stand on.

249
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,645
Please take a good look at the victim's autopsy report.

250
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:03,045
There should be iidako inside the contents of his stomach.

251
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,645
Mimasu always has iidako

252
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:07,445
being that it is one of their specialties.

253
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,045
By the way, I checked with

254
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:12,745
all the restaurants in the vicinity and found that

255
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,645
there is no other shop that includes iidako in their menu

256
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:17,645
except for Mimasu.

257
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,945
Let's say it was as the defense claims

258
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:22,845
and the defendant did in fact visit Mimasu that night,

259
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:25,145
what difference does that make?

260
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,045
It makes a great difference!

261
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:29,945
Because it means that the victim has met someone

262
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:33,945
other than the defendant that has the motive to commit murder.

263
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:38,145
Hey! The only customer that was there back then was me!

264
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,445
The person didn't have to be a customer, right?

265
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:41,745
What?

266
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:43,345
Don't tell me...

267
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,845
Don't be ridiculous!

268
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,745
I, Kogoro Mouri, will guarantee that

269
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,645
the owner of Mimasu would never do such a thing...

270
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:59,945
Thinking something like that is completely incorrect.

271
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,445
Dear?

272
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,745
The point that leads to the key to solving this case is

273
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:10,145
the actual kind of relationship the defendant Usami

274
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:14,145
and his wife Masako had with each other.

275
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:15,245
It is true that

276
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:17,345
the relationship between the two became quite hostile

277
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:18,745
to the point of getting a divorce

278
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,445
after they lost their beloved son by accident?

279
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:22,945
But they also believed that

280
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:25,545
the man Hirasawa was to blame for the entire incident.

281
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:27,245
And that night,

282
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,645
defendant Usami ran into the very person

283
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,145
who had torn them apart and got into an argument.

284
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:34,445
After the argument,

285
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,445
they were chased out of the shop at 20:30.

286
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:40,545
The defendant took Mr. Hirasawa

287
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:44,245
to Mimasu where Masako was.

288
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,045
Well, I guess you could say,

289
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:47,845
he coincidentally ran into the guy

290
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,845
he had held a grudge against for years,

291
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:51,945
and didn't know what to do,

292
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,545
so he took the victim over to his ex-wife's shop.

293
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:59,045
And that was about a little past 20:45.

294
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:01,845
On the other hand, Masako,

295
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:03,945
who sees Hirasawa right before her eyes,

296
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:05,745
finds that all the flames of hatred

297
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,945
that she had almost forgotten revives within her.

298
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,645
So, she sends the defendant home

299
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,245
and lures Hirasawa out to the construction site,

300
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,845
which after she kills him.

301
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:19,145
After that she rushes back to Mimasu,

302
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:23,645
sees me asleep and goes ahead to establish her false alibi.

303
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,945
In other words, the false alibi that the prosecutor saw through

304
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,345
was not for the defendant,

305
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:33,345
but rather actually of Masako!

306
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:38,545
Just as expected of a detective!

307
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,145
Your story is very well made up indeed.

308
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,545
However, this happens to be a courtroom

309
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:44,745
and not a place to make people

310
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,045
listen to your fantastic deductions.

311
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,945
This is a place to battle truth against truth.

312
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:52,145
Do you happen to disagree with my deduction?

313
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,445
First of all, how do you know that

314
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:57,145
the defendant went home while leaving the victim behind?

315
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,645
How can you tell that he didn't ask his wife

316
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,545
to make up his alibi and then take the victim out himself?

317
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:05,845
If so, then the defendant should be

318
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:09,845
insisting on his alibi to begin with, right?

319
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,245
Another thing.

320
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,345
How are you going to explain the car key of the defendant

321
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:15,045
that was found at the site?

322
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,945
That's simple.

323
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:20,045
The defendant himself put it near the corpse.

324
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:25,045
Although the defendant left the shop alone,

325
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:27,445
he probably got worried and returned to the shop.

326
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,145
There, he runs into

327
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:34,145
the site where Masako had killed Hirasawa.

328
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:37,745
The defendant probably thought as follows.

329
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:38,845
That it would be better for him

330
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:40,545
to be accused of homicide on the grounds

331
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:44,045
that he was drunk, rather than his wife being charged.

332
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,145
Maybe he thought that

333
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,345
just like Hirasawa who had killed his son,

334
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:51,145
he would be able to get away with a lighter sentence.

335
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:53,345
That's ridiculous.

336
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,845
A sentence doesn't always get lighter

337
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,145
just because a person is drunk, you know?

338
00:18:58,145 --> 00:18:59,345
It could be the opposite

339
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:00,845
and the person could be charged with a heavier crime.

340
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:04,845
That's because the defendant loves his wife even now.

341
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,945
And because Masako deep down inside still loves him, too.

342
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,745
As proof of this...

343
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:11,945
This is the match of Mimasu.

344
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:15,145
On the back side, Mimasu is written in romaji.

345
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,645
What kind of proof are saying it is?

346
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:22,445
Right. If you read this from the opposite end in romaji,

347
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,245
it reads Usami M.

348
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:28,145
In other words, it's the name of their son Masaki

349
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,445
and her name before she got divorced

350
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:31,945
back in the days, when they were a happy family.

351
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:35,845
And the defendant after seeing that match,

352
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:38,445
found out how she really felt

353
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,345
so he went out of his way to take the blame for the murder

354
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,545
in order to save his wife.

355
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:47,545
That's a lie! I'm the one who killed that guy!

356
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:49,145
It's a lie that my wife did it!

357
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,145
I killed him with my very hands...

358
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,045
I killed Hirasawa with these hands!

359
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:53,845
Stop it already, dear.

360
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:57,645
It's all right.

361
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,645
I understand very well how you feel now.

362
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:05,045
I'm so sorry that I testified the way I did.

363
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,545
I didn't know anything at all about the key.

364
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,945
Just as Mr. Mouri has pointed out,

365
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:13,345
I'm the one who killed Hirasawa.

366
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,945
Masako.

367
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:20,345
He had forgotten who I was.

368
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:26,245
Haven't we met somewhere before?

369
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:28,845
Huh? With you?

370
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,045
Nope, I don't think so.

371
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:34,845
Because I'd never forget an attractive woman like you.

372
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:37,445
Is that so?

373
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:41,345
He messed up and broke our family up,

374
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:43,645
yet he doesn't even remember how I look.

375
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,445
I just couldn't forgive him!

376
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,245
Masako...

377
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:52,345
A couple mutually trying to protect each other

378
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,445
at first glance looks beautiful.

379
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:58,145
However, a crime is a crime.

380
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:01,345
If you really love your wife,

381
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,745
you should help her get back on her feet

382
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:07,245
after she makes amends for what she did.

383
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,445
Don't you think that's what real love is all about?

384
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:41,345
I was completely beaten today.

385
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:42,745
I lost completely.

386
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:44,845
Besides, to have my case turned around like that

387
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,445
not by the defense attorney, but the witness

388
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,245
is a first time experience for me.

389
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,545
I guess, same here.

390
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,045
I'll see you in the courtroom again with the next case.

391
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,945
Take it easy on me then, will you?

392
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,545
Same here.

393
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:04,045
I need you to keep up

394
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:07,745
your successive victory record yet, Ms. Kisaki.

395
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:08,945
Huh?

396
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:12,945
It's my mission to throw dirt on her.

397
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:17,245
Dear, thank you for everything today.

398
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,045
I guess I'll thank you for now.

399
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:20,445
Huh?

400
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:23,945
And about after this,

401
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,945
if you have some time,

402
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:29,945
why don't we go to a restaurant for a meal?

403
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:33,145
Then, we can take our time and talk...

404
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,845
Miss.

405
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:37,145
If it's okay with you,

406
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:39,145
would you let me take you out to eat something?

407
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,445
Dad!

408
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,345
He seems to be very busy right now,

409
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:47,745
so I guess we can go to dinner some other time.

410
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:49,345
Let's go, Ms. Kuriyama.

411
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,645
Yes!

412
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,745
Mother, wait!

413
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:54,345
Mother!

414
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:58,445
Seriously! Dad!

415
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:00,045
Well, well...

416
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:03,245
It's not going to work out the way Ran wants it to for a while.

417
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,645
"Next Episode"

418
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,945
What?

419
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:10,345
Mr. Nigaki is nowhere in sight?

420
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,545
Anyway, let's go search for him

421
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:14,545
before the visibility becomes zero!

422
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:17,045
Conan, wait for us in the lodge.

423
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:19,845
All right!

424
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:21,445
Let's go, Saburo.

425
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:35,266
Next Conan, "Bloody Valentine (The Case)"

426
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:38,063
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:38,063 --> 00:24:39,963
"Chocolate"
