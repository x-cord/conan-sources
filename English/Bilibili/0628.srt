1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,940
Another letter of warning of an upcoming crime is delivered.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,640
However, this time he says he's coming to return

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,740
the items that another thief had stolen previously

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,040
to its original owner.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,540
All three items belonged to Ryoma Sakamoto.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,040
Meanwhile, the original owner Mr. Tarumi

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,040
and the appraiser Mr. Hanamura

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,340
held a Ryoma exhibition in the Great Suzuki Museum.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,640
At the exhibition grounds, the gunbelt with a ruby on it

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,740
that was given to Ryoma by Shinsaku Takasugi, along with a pistol,

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,140
was on display.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,940
Rumors that Thief Kid may be after the gunbelt also go around.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,640
Metal detector gates are set up

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
at the entrance of the exhibition grounds

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,440
since among the items that Thief Kid will be returning,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,340
a pistol is included.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,340
But, something bothers me.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,940
Will such a method really help to capture Thief Kid?

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,140
Like the fog clears.

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,340
Let's see through love and crime as well.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,240
Unbelievable, he's returning the treasure.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,340
What is Thief Kid's real target?

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,040
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:42,923
"Conan vs. Kid Battle for the Treasures of Ryoma (Part 2)"

27
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,023
Officers guarding the entrance of the museum!

28
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,223
How are thing there?

29
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:54,423
Yes, sir! There's no one who was surprised by the gate and left!

30
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:57,223
Are the metal detector gates functioning all right?

31
00:02:57,223 --> 00:03:01,123
Yes, sir! Nobody is in possession of the pistol in question.

32
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,823
How about in the exhibition room?

33
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:07,423
There is no one who looks to be Thief Kid here for now.

34
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,123
Is Thief Kid really going to show up?

35
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,623
Idiot!

36
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,823
There isn't a time that Kid had warned of a crime

37
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:14,023
and not shown up!

38
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:15,923
I'm sorry, sir!

39
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,523
Come on, Kid.

40
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:23,123
I'll nab you for sure this time!

41
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:29,923
Wow! Fantastic!

42
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:33,323
It really looks like the boarding gate at the airport!

43
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,823
Moreover, there are three gates too.

44
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,723
Uncle sure is something!

45
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,923
Something bothers me, after all.

46
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,623
Writing something like,

47
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:47,523
"I'll be bringing the pistol with me" deliberately,

48
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:49,323
I'm sure he would assume that something like this

49
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,323
would happen, and yet...

50
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,123
In addition, I can't even make out

51
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:57,423
how he plans to use the rain to his advantage yet, either.

52
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,423
The last sentence of the letter.

53
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,323
"I pledge to clean up once and for all."

54
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:03,723
I don't understand what it means.

55
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:08,523
Did he just happen to use Ryoma's phrase to play on words?

56
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:13,623
Or, is he really planning to wash something?

57
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:15,723
Come on! Let's go inside too!

58
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,323
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:22,423
It's set up so that the corridor on the other side of the entrance

60
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,823
of the Ryoma Exhibition is blocked off by a wall

61
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:29,323
so you have to go through the gate get inside.

62
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:33,423
The only thing that is in between is the restroom, but...

63
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,423
Inside the restroom...

64
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,623
There was only one window

65
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:44,523
with bars and coming in from outside is impossible.

66
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:46,223
So, it would be impossible to bring a pistol inside

67
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:47,823
under the present situation.

68
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,223
Conan?

69
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,223
We're going in.

70
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,323
Yes!

71
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:57,223
Check out the crowd of people here.

72
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,523
Attention please!

73
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:02,523
The exhibition ground is getting to be very crowded.

74
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:04,623
We are sorry to announce that

75
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:06,123
viewing the Ryoma Exhibition

76
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,323
will be limited to ten minutes.

77
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:12,323
So they say, but it looks like nobody's leaving.

78
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,823
-Yeah. -Right!

79
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:17,623
There's still two hours to go before the assumed arrival time,

80
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:21,123
but maybe Sir Thief Kid is already mingled somewhere in here already.

81
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:23,323
But, you can't go through the gate

82
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,423
with a pistol on you, can you?

83
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:28,423
Besides, the items that he's returning today

84
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:31,223
are things that another thief stole,

85
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:32,923
so he may just call it off, right?

86
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:36,523
What do you mean by another thief?

87
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:39,523
The three items that Thief Kid is going to return this time...

88
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:43,223
Ryoma's last letter, the blood stained goblet

89
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:46,523
and the pistol that he had in his pocket when he was assassinated

90
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:49,323
are all things that a woman thief

91
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:51,923
called Phantom Lady stole 20 years ago!

92
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:54,123
Who's Phantom Lady?

93
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:58,323
She was called the woman with 20 faces of the Showa era

94
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,223
and was a great thief who used horrific methods

95
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:02,423
to steal only from businesses and rich people

96
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:05,123
who were making money by evil means.

97
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:07,223
Therefore, she seems to have been really popular!

98
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:11,323
Well, she isn't as great as my Sir Thief Kid, though.

99
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:17,223
But, why is Kid returning the items that the lady thief stole?

100
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,823
How should I know?

101
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,623
Maybe they know each other?

102
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:22,823
After all, they're both thieves.

103
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:27,223
Oh, I got to go to the men's room again,

104
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:30,123
-so go on ahead without me. -Oh, okay.

105
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,323
Geez.

106
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,023
Look at the crowd of people here.

107
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,423
It's like a bargain sale or something.

108
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:42,223
Oh, Sonoko, are you all right?

109
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:44,423
Ouch...

110
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:47,023
Geez, who pushed me?

111
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:50,723
Phantom Lady...

112
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,323
Found it!

113
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:55,023
I guess there's no mistake that Phantom Lady

114
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,123
was the one who stole the three items 20 years ago.

115
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:00,023
But, for some reason, after that one incident,

116
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:02,523
she stopped committing crimes completely.

117
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,023
Rather, even after that incident,

118
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,923
although she sent out advance warnings of crimes

119
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,323
and traces of her having broken in were found,

120
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:11,123
nothing was stolen.

121
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:15,623
The last thing she stole was Ryoma's pistol.

122
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:19,023
A 32 caliber 5 bullet model

123
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:22,023
with a length of about 17cm.

124
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:25,523
17cm is about...

125
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:28,323
This long?

126
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:32,023
June 24th, 1867.

127
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:33,723
The pistol is also mentioned in the letter

128
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,323
that Ryoma wrote to his older sister Otome on that date.

129
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,123
The length is about 3.03cm, capable of holding 5 bullets

130
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,523
and smaller than a dagger, but...

131
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:47,523
it can shoot people dead from a distance.

132
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,423
-You see! -Kid!

133
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:52,823
The door won't open!

134
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,823
Darn! He closed it using a stopper.

135
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,223
How'd you get that pistol through?

136
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:00,623
You mean you made it through the gate?

137
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:02,223
Yeah.

138
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:05,423
Removing the lead that was in the grip made going through a breeze!

139
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:07,123
It becomes really light too.

140
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,423
Well, but since they were in large numbers,

141
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:11,023
it wasn't that easy carrying them, though!

142
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,023
The lead in the grip?

143
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,823
In large numbers?

144
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,623
What're you talking about?

145
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:17,923
Let me remind you once more.

146
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:21,823
I just came to return items that were stolen this time.

147
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:24,323
So, don't you get in the way, famed detective!

148
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,023
-See you! -Oh, hey.

149
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,423
Hold it!

150
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,323
Darn!

151
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:35,523
Hey, are you sure everything's okay?

152
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:39,223
If Thief Kid is nabbed by the police...

153
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:40,823
Don't worry!

154
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,823
Let's believe in him who appears at most unexpected places.

155
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:48,523
If he makes a clean get away, we'll make a lot of cash again.

156
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:52,523
But, he's coming to return the items, you know!

157
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:55,123
No need for worry.

158
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:57,523
I've got everything thought out.

159
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:58,923
Say, mister.

160
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,923
What happened to you finger?

161
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:03,423
Oh.

162
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,823
I was appraising a Japanese sword this morning

163
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:08,423
and cut my finger then...

164
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,723
Darn! He's already inside the exhibition room?

165
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:25,523
Where?

166
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,823
Where'd he go?

167
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:32,423
What're you...

168
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:36,823
Ran?

169
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,123
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:41,923
I figured you'd get squashed in this crowd.

171
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:43,723
But, at this rate,

172
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:46,523
it'll get even worse at the announced time.

173
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:48,123
Sonoko.

174
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:51,423
There's something on your right sleeve.

175
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,523
I think something's written.

176
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:57,523
One of the iron ones?

177
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:00,223
One of the iron ones?

178
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:01,923
Is it some kind of code?

179
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:03,923
Sonoko,

180
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:06,623
didn't you bump into something inside the exhibition room?

181
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:10,123
That's right,

182
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,523
somebody pushed me

183
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,423
and I fell to the showcase where the gunbelt was.

184
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:16,223
The showcase where the gunbelt is displayed.

185
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:23,623
Don't tell me that he's really going to make it rain

186
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,923
in order to clean this corrupted exhibition hall up.

187
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:35,223
Darn, Kid!

188
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:37,423
Where the heck is he planning to sneak in from?

189
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,723
Inspector Nakamori.

190
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,523
He may be capable of appearing at unexpected places

191
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:42,523
at unexpected times,

192
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,523
yet he couldn't possibly get through that metal detector gate

193
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:49,023
-while carrying a pistol. -Yeah, I'd like to think so too.

194
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,823
-But he... -If he were to break through the gate,

195
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:56,823
that pistol is a replica that he made,

196
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,223
is that it?

197
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,623
Of course, after all the three items are returned,

198
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:05,223
I'll have you appraise them, Mr. Hanamura.

199
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:06,323
Yes.

200
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:09,423
I sure hope that they're all genuine.

201
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:13,323
Never mind that, but I hope Ryoma's gunbelt is all right?

202
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,623
We did a final check of the exhibition cases

203
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,723
just before opening, you see.

204
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:21,223
If you like, would you like to go to the site?

205
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,523
Yes.

206
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:25,223
If the three items that are returned turn out to be fake

207
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:28,923
and the moreover, the gunbelt is stolen,

208
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:31,823
I wouldn't be able to take it.

209
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:38,823
It's getting to be crowded.

210
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,523
Only four minutes more to the time Sir Kid announced he'd be here.

211
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:44,323
Do you think we should start on our way inside?

212
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,223
But, with all these people here,

213
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,923
we may not be able to see Kid even if he appears.

214
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:51,123
Oh. Inspector Nakamori.

215
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:53,323
Uncle Jirokichi too!

216
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:56,623
Police! Please open the way!

217
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:57,923
Police!

218
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:00,323
Come on, let's go on in too!

219
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:02,723
I don't think you should!

220
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,223
Conan?

221
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,423
Why shouldn't we go inside?

222
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:12,323
Because, you don't want to get wet, do you?

223
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:16,323
I think Kid is really thinking of washing and cleaning here!

224
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,823
Darn! They're just too many people here.

225
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:21,023
We couldn't possibly guard this place safely.

226
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,423
What?

227
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:28,423
What's that?

228
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,523
Thief Kid!

229
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,070
Thief Kid!

230
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,570
He's standing on top of the gunbelt case.

231
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,870
Sir Kid is so fantastic.

232
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,970
He's gone through the metal detector and is unarmed!

233
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,670
-Nab him! -Yes, sir!

234
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,070
How dare you, Kid?

235
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,070
Clean up, my foot!

236
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,970
I'll get you and give you a good clean wash instead!

237
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,770
Yes. Clean wash.

238
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,870
In order to give a clean wash, water is needed.

239
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,070
So, starting now, right here...

240
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,770
Watch, I shall make it rain.

241
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,370
Rain?

242
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,170
What the heck is he planning to do?

243
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,070
That rat.

244
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,870
He used fire to set the extinguisher sprinkler off!

245
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,970
I shall be on my way, then.

246
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,270
Hey, hold it!

247
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,470
Weren't you going to return the three items in question?

248
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,870
This shower will bring everything to light.

249
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,370
As the rain shall wash away polluted water.

250
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,270
That rat!

251
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,870
He changed the water pressure of the sprinkler!

252
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,470
He's disappearing within the smoke of water...

253
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,870
Darn.

254
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,570
He disappeared?

255
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,770
That Kid!

256
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,770
He's going to mingle among the crowd and flee!

257
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,870
Hey!

258
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,470
How many people went outside where the gate is just now?

259
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,870
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,770
-There were about two or three people. -It's them!

261
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,870
Among them, nab the one who is drenched!

262
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,670
He's the Kid!

263
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,570
If he changed clothes inside that shower and disguised himself,

264
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,870
he should be soaking wet!

265
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,770
But...

266
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,170
it's also raining heavily outside too,

267
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,470
so most of the people are wet.

268
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,070
Then, look at his feet!

269
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,770
Go after the wet footsteps that left the gate!

270
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,670
But most naturally the floor is also filled with wet footprints.

271
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,870
What?

272
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,170
I see.

273
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,970
That's why he was waiting for a rainy day.

274
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,670
Then, what about the three items he said he'd be returning?

275
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,670
They're right here.

276
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,770
They're on top this gunbelt case.

277
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,770
Oops, the goblet's got my blood on it.

278
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,870
Oh well, but all three of them seem to be replicas...

279
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,670
So there should be no problem.

280
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,770
If there should be need for concern, it would be this gunbelt but...

281
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,970
The crime prevention device inside is destroyed!

282
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,670
Which means that the gunbelt that is inside is a fake

283
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,570
that Kid had switched for the genuine one! Darn!

284
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,670
He got what he wanted after all.

285
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,770
Huh?

286
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,870
Is anything the matter?

287
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,270
The explanation plate in the case.

288
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,470
Something's hanging from it.

289
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,970
Paint?

290
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,470
What? It's doubled.

291
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,770
I see!

292
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,070
A duplicate explanatory plate written in water color

293
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,170
was pasted on top of the one on the bottom and made

294
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,370
so that when wet by water, the words written below would emerge.

295
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,670
I see!

296
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,170
It was because my sleeve was wet with rain.

297
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,370
Yes.

298
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,770
The words on the explanatory plate of the gunbelt

299
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,670
rubbed off as mirrored image.

300
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,870
Yes.

301
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,370
And? What's written on it?

302
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,670
Let's see.

303
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,370
This gunbelt is super fake to begin with because...

304
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,870
Because it's been mass produced

305
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,270
taking into consideration the fact that it may be stolen.

306
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,570
That's right, isn't it?

307
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,170
The important thing is

308
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,170
the fact that it was stolen makes the news,

309
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,470
and that this is known the world over.

310
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,070
So, replicas of the item was made in large quantities to begin with,

311
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,570
then sold by a third party to rich Ryoma fans.

312
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,870
Telling them that it's the item that was stolen the other day!

313
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,570
The advantage of this method,

314
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,870
is that even if the buyer realizes that he bought a fake,

315
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,270
a complaint won't be submitted.

316
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,170
Because they feel guilty about having secretly bought a stolen item,

317
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,970
they have no way of making a case of it, even if they wanted to.

318
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,870
That's why the crimes that Phantom Lady committed

319
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,070
after stealing the three items didn't come into the light.

320
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:24,070
She probably only targeted the people who purchased the three items.

321
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,670
Phantom Lady gave you all the load fake items that she collected

322
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,470
and asked you to disclose the evil deeds of the two, didn't she?

323
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,470
She also told you that this crime wouldn't have been possible

324
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,770
without the host who exhibited the items knowing they were fake

325
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,470
and the corrupt appraiser who appraised

326
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,070
the items as being authentic joining hands.

327
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,470
Isn't that right?

328
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,570
Thief Kid disguised as Ryoma!

329
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,570
Hey! Is the thing written on the plate true?

330
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,870
No! That's just nonsense!

331
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,370
In the first place, where is the large amount of fake items anyway?

332
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,370
The only three items here are a plastic pistol,

333
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,570
fake goblet and a letter.

334
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,570
Inspector!

335
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,070
We have a gunbelt around our hips and a pistol!

336
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,470
There's one on my hips too.

337
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,970
What?

338
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,570
Taken from Mr. Tarumi's storage room, it says.

339
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,470
Darn, Kid!

340
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,070
He used the crowd to wrap the gunbelts around our hips!

341
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,670
I see.

342
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,570
He broke the crime prevention device to begin with,

343
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
and made it look to be stolen.

344
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,870
This time the scheme was to sell the gunbelt.

345
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,770
-Oh, well... -Inspector!

346
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,370
What is it now?

347
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,070
The paint of the other explanatory plates is coming off

348
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,070
-and words are appearing. -What?

349
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,070
It's written in great detail,

350
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,270
what and where of this item are fake!

351
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,870
Moreover, at the end of the letter it is written in English.

352
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,870
In English?

353
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,970
Pull.

354
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,770
Pull... pull down?

355
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,570
Does it mean to pull this hanging scroll?

356
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,570
What is it?

357
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,070
This is...

358
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,470
Ryoma's letter!

359
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,170
Moreover, many of the same kind of letters!

360
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,070
They seem to be complete replicas of the letter

361
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,870
that was found on the gunbelt case.

362
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,370
A trap!

363
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,670
This is a trap that Kid set up!

364
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,670
Sir!

365
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,670
You have no proof that we made them and sold them off.

366
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,970
Hey, Sonoko?

367
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,870
But, that's what's written on Sir Kid's plate!

368
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,570
To crack it.

369
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,570
Hey, what's this?

370
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,770
There is a large number of goblets inside!

371
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:20,370
Moreover, each of them seem to be stained with blood.

372
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,070
If we do a DNA check of the blood,

373
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,170
it'll be obvious who made the fake goblets.

374
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,770
Do you want to make it through by touching it

375
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,270
with your hurt finger like you did a while ago?

376
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,770
So as to stain all the goblets here with your own blood.

377
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,070
Well, I'm sure that if we check your storage room,

378
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,570
we'll come up with the items, no?

379
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,770
A heap of the fake items that you couldn't sell off.

380
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,770
Amazing that you figured out that I'm Thief Kid.

381
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,070
I'm no different from any other man around, am I?

382
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,870
Simple!

383
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,170
Even if the pistols are made of plastic,

384
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,270
they would become quite a load

385
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,270
if you have to carry a great number of them, right?

386
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,470
If you also have to carry a large amount of goblets

387
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,270
and letters at the same time, the more so!

388
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,270
That's why I looked for a thin person

389
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,170
from hip down who was mingled among the crowd!

390
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,770
And I found you, who had a whole lot of stuff stashed on yourself,

391
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,770
so you had to disguise yourself as a fat man.

392
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,470
Of course, since you're in disguise,

393
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,970
you weren't perspiring either!

394
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:51,070
I stuck a button type transmitter on the guy's thin ankle,

395
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,170
confirmed your location using these pursuit glasses,

396
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,570
and called out to you!

397
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,170
Well?

398
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,270
Do you plan to turn me into the police?

399
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,570
No.

400
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,470
In respect of Ryoma, I will let you go this time.

401
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,270
Are you a Ryoma fan?

402
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,570
It's Mom!

403
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,670
She played the role of Otome, Ryoma's older sister once

404
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,470
and is head over heels over him.

405
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,670
I see.

406
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,470
Well, she was said to be too cute to play the role of Otome,

407
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,970
and that's what triggered her popularity, though.

408
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,270
Well, but we mutually...

409
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,070
cannot beat our mothers.

410
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,770
See ya

411
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,970
Mutually?

412
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,070
Hey, don't tell me that Phantom Lady is...

413
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,970
Hey, isnt that Yuya Miyasaka?

414
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,570
The actor that is said to have caused trouble when he was drunk.

415
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,070
Ready.

416
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,670
Action!

417
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,970
You idiot!

418
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,070
Punched... again...

419
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,870
Mr. Miyasaka is dead!

420
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,770
No!

421
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,170
Somethings... somethings not right.

422
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,870
Next Conan, "Promotion Video Filming (Part 1)"

423
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:23,097
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,997
"Liquid Foundation" (Li Kid for Thief Kid)

425
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,797
Maybe I'll get to see Sir Thief Kid again in the next episode.

426
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:28,597
After all, it's "Likid".

427
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:29,697
Sonoko.
