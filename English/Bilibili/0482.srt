1
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:03,391
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,191
After the tears, a cook is born.

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,691
Officer Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police.

4
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,291
Breaks through the deduction spinning round and round.

5
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,191
And solves the mystery of the missing murder weapon.

6
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,591
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:13,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,591
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:59,643
We came along with Doc to go camping

10
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:01,343
during summer vacation.

11
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:04,743
But, our car got a flat on the way,

12
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:06,543
so we had no choice

13
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,243
but to ask an old woman who lived alone in a remote mountain area

14
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,043
to let us spend the night at her place.

15
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,743
"Tanaka Iwae, age 74"

16
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,743
Likewise, two men and a woman,

17
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:17,243
"Akane Ouba, age 25" -three people who also get lost,

18
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:20,043
"Raito Adachi, age 29" -spend the night in the same house together.

19
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,243
"Fuga Kahara, age 28"

20
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,143
That night, Mitsuhiko who goes to the restroom,

21
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,943
witnesses something gruesome,

22
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:32,943
and right afterwards, the girl named Akane Ouba is found murdered!

23
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:38,943
This... granny...

24
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:42,143
was...

25
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,243
sharpening a kitchen knife!

26
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:46,443
Her hair was disheveled!

27
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:49,043
And, it was a knife with a bright red handle.

28
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,043
She looked like an ogre!

29
00:02:54,843 --> 00:03:00,743
"The Knife of The Mountain Crone Part Two"

30
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:04,643
Is it true? What you just said.

31
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,043
It's true!

32
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,543
Which means...

33
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:12,043
You're saying that a knife with a bright red handle

34
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,343
is not here?

35
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,343
Huh? Yes.

36
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,343
You heard what he said.

37
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:20,443
Well, I don't know anything about a knife

38
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:22,243
with a bright red handle.

39
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,843
I'm sure that he was probably freaked out by me

40
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,043
looking like a mountain crone,

41
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:30,043
that's why he saw such an illusion.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,443
But I'm sure that I saw her.

43
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:38,543
We're going to start a thorough search of the house right now.

44
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:42,343
So will you all please wait in the room beyond.

45
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:47,343
Come on, let's go, Yoshida.

46
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,243
Okay.

47
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,643
Huh? That's strange.

48
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:54,843
What's strange?

49
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,143
The hammer that I brought to hammer in the pegs of the tent

50
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:59,143
isn't here.

51
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,543
Hammer?

52
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:03,643
That bag was left out in the corridor, wasn't it?

53
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,143
Hey, don't tell me that the killer...

54
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:10,943
Don't be silly, you can't slash a person's neck with a hammer.

55
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,943
That's right.

56
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:15,743
I'm going to ask the officer.

57
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:19,843
Oh, I'll go with you.

58
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,843
The hammer was found in the forest nearby.

59
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,143
A pretty new one too.

60
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:27,743
Huh? Really?

61
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,943
Then, you'd better check thoroughly!

62
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:31,943
The killer may have used it.

63
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:35,043
But, a hammer is not a knife.

64
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,343
What's wrong?

65
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:41,743
That... did you check that box?

66
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:42,943
Huh?

67
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:45,343
Oh no, not the boxes around here yet...

68
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,443
Hey, boy!

69
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:58,443
Hey, this is a knife!

70
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,143
A knife with a red handle.

71
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,343
This is the knife that Mitsuhiko saw.

72
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,443
It's well maintained and the blade is sharp.

73
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:09,443
Huh? Below the knife maker's signature named...

74
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,543
Shota?

75
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:14,443
Shota is the name of granny's grandson.

76
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,143
Huh? Nothing was detected?

77
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,243
Luminol reaction wasn't detected?

78
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:22,043
No. None was detected from the knives in this house

79
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,343
or from your camping equipment.

80
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:26,343
Of course there were no traces on the knife

81
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:28,343
with the red handle either.

82
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:32,243
After you found it and all, too bad.

83
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:35,443
I see. So, that's the story after all.

84
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,943
By the way,

85
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,143
did you people play with mud or something?

86
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:40,843
What? Play with mud?

87
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:41,843
We found traces showing

88
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:46,543
that several people walked around this house with muddy feet.

89
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,643
Traces of muddy feet?

90
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:51,143
Of the dead body being moved without permission

91
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,443
and walking around with muddy feet.

92
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,143
I mean what a thing to do.

93
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,043
Wait a second, muddy feet...

94
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,743
If I remember correctly, back then...

95
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,243
Huh? Okay.

96
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,843
Granny was barefoot.

97
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:07,943
Even the man called Fuga.

98
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:10,643
I ran out barefoot too.

99
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,143
The man called Raito...

100
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:13,743
Raito!

101
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:14,743
Fuga?

102
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,043
He was wearing shoes.

103
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,043
Hey!

104
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,443
Huh?

105
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:22,443
Just what're you doing?

106
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:26,043
Because the goldfish looked thirsty and I felt sorry for it.

107
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:27,643
What?

108
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,143
See. Last night the water was up here

109
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,243
to where the water stain is,

110
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,443
but it's decreased quite a bit.

111
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,743
This means that the goldfish was hot

112
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,843
and drank a lot of water, right?

113
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:42,043
I see, that's why the killer used the hammer.

114
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:44,343
That's why I put tap water inside.

115
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:45,543
That's not good, Ayumi.

116
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,643
Huh?

117
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:49,643
You've got to get rid of the chlorine first

118
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,943
or it will weaken the goldfish.

119
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:56,143
Besides, the goldfish are keeping watch,

120
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,743
so you shouldn't keep them from doing so.

121
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,143
Keeping watch?

122
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:03,643
Yeah, the weapon which has been in use since ancient times,

123
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,243
over its location, that is.

124
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:09,643
I will explain from the conclusion.

125
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:14,043
There were no traces of luminol reaction detected

126
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:18,343
from knives and sharp objects in this house nor any of your belongings.

127
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:21,443
Moreover, after you all ran over to Ms. Ouba who screamed

128
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:25,643
when she was slashed in the throat,

129
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:29,643
and considering that none of you left this house,

130
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:33,643
it would've been impossible to take the murder weapon away.

131
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:37,243
Therefore, all of you cannot be suspects.

132
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:40,743
We means that we won't be interrogated either?

133
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,543
No, we'd like to use your testimonies

134
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,743
as reference for further investigation,

135
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:49,743
so we may ask you to come to the station at a later date.

136
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:52,343
Well, if it's not as a suspect, I guess it's okay.

137
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,543
Excuse me.

138
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,443
What about the knife?

139
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,043
Yeah, as to that,

140
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:02,143
Conan found it put away in a wooden box.

141
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:05,443
As to why you didn't talk about that knife,

142
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,643
we'll thoroughly hear you out later at the station.

143
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:11,743
I had just forgotten about it.

144
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:14,143
After all, I'm old, you know.

145
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:17,543
But, how did the killer get away?

146
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:20,643
There were no strange footprints around the house

147
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,643
except for by the front entrance, right?

148
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,543
Oh, as to that...

149
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:28,943
I'm sure that the killer used some kind of a trick.

150
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:33,543
No... it's only natural that there are no footprints.

151
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:37,043
Because the killer and the murder weapon is still in this house.

152
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:39,043
What...

153
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:42,843
Hey, tell me first if you're going to use my voice.

154
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,443
You surprised me out of my wits.

155
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:45,743
Sorry.

156
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:48,443
No offense.

157
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:51,843
We, the police checked the house thoroughly and found nothing.

158
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:56,043
Just where in this house do you claim is the murder weapon?

159
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,943
It's not that you didn't find it.

160
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,043
It's just that you haven't checked it yet.

161
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:04,043
Why? Because that murder weapon is something that was in this house

162
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,243
to begin with that the killer transformed into a knife.

163
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:10,343
It doesn't look to be a murder weapon at all.

164
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,943
Transformed?

165
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:14,743
Something in this house?

166
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,443
Please wait.

167
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:19,543
Using something that was in this house to begin with,

168
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:20,943
would mean that the killer is someone

169
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,343
that knows a lot about this house.

170
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:26,043
Are you saying that the granny who lives here

171
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,943
is the killer after all?

172
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:30,243
No...

173
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,443
Huh?

174
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:35,143
There is another person here that has been living in this house

175
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:36,643
for about 20 years.

176
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,343
Here?

177
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:39,643
Isn't that right?

178
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:43,443
Grandson of granny, Mr. Fuga Kahara.

179
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,443
What the...

180
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,743
Hey, Fuga, is that true?

181
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:50,843
That's ridiculous.

182
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,343
Come to think of it,

183
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,643
when asked about the bathroom of this house,

184
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,243
you answered right away, didn't you?

185
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:59,943
I remembered because I used it last night...

186
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:02,043
Then, why did you say those words?

187
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,843
Said what?

188
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:08,143
Remember, what you said when you first came here?

189
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:11,943
Boy, do you live here?

190
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:16,143
That means that you knew I don't live here, right?

191
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:18,443
Oh, well, that's...

192
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,443
Is that right?

193
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:24,043
Huh? I was asked by her grandson to do him a favor.

194
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,343
He asked me to check up and see how his grandmother

195
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:28,143
that he hadn't seen for some time is doing.

196
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:31,843
He told me that his grandmother was living alone.

197
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:34,243
Then, why did you know about the goldfish?

198
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:35,843
Goldfish?

199
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,743
I remember you saying,

200
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,143
of all the 12 goldfish here,

201
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:42,943
the Tamasaba is a rare species.

202
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,843
Didn't I also say back then

203
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:47,543
that I used to keep goldfish as pets before.

204
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,043
It's natural to be able to tell goldfish apart by looking at them.

205
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:53,543
No, not the species, but the number.

206
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:55,343
Number?

207
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:57,243
No matter how knowledgeable you are with goldfish,

208
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:59,243
to know at a glance

209
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,543
that there are 12 of them swimming around in the tank,

210
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:05,543
no one would know except for the person who owns the goldfish, right?

211
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,643
I see, that's true.

212
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:12,743
No, that's not it. I...

213
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:16,143
I...

214
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,043
Then, don't tell me that getting lost here

215
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,343
and running out of gas were...

216
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:21,743
Yeah, probably.

217
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:24,343
He did it deliberately

218
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,743
so that he could check on how his grandmother was doing.

219
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,243
He probably thought that she wouldn't recognize his face

220
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,643
after plastic surgery.

221
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:32,243
I see...

222
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:35,443
Which means, the reason why you didn't want to go through interrogation

223
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:37,343
as much as you did was...

224
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,243
You are the killer!

225
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:42,243
No! I didn't do it! It's not me!

226
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,643
No, you said what you said

227
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:45,443
only because you wanted to hide your real name.

228
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,443
Real name?

229
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:48,643
When Fuga started to make a fuss,

230
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:51,943
you were about to say something, weren't you, Raito?

231
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:56,043
Oh, I figured I should give my real name at that time.

232
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:59,843
Raito Adachi is the name that I use back at the shop.

233
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,843
A pseudonym?

234
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,643
What's your name then?

235
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:05,543
Since he was afraid that this would happen,

236
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:09,543
he began making a fuss over the interrogation.

237
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:12,143
What Fuga wanted to hide was the fact

238
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:17,043
that he was the grandson Shota of Mrs. Iwae Tanaka.

239
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:20,543
So, when you say he just wanted to hide his name,

240
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:22,643
do you mean that he's not the killer?

241
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,543
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,843
But, just a while ago you said that,

243
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:33,643
the killer skillfully used something from this house, didn't you?

244
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:36,343
So, even if you don't know the details of the house,

245
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,243
it's something that can be used as a weapon

246
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:40,943
so long as you look at it and know what it is.

247
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,143
If that certain thing is used along

248
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:44,943
with my hammer that was stolen.

249
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,143
Hammer?

250
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:50,543
Remember? Ayumi seemed to be worried about it.

251
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,843
Me?

252
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:55,243
You asked whether the water in the aquarium decreased in one night

253
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:58,243
because the goldfish drank the water.

254
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:01,043
But, that wasn't it.

255
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:03,943
Something that was inside the aquarium was taken out.

256
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:07,543
-Huh? -So, what's that something?

257
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:10,743
It was used frequently as a weapon

258
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:13,243
during the Jomon Period.

259
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:17,743
Obsidian.

260
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,451
Obsidian, you say...

261
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,351
Right. If you shatter it,

262
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,451
it becomes quite a sharp piece of knife-like object.

263
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:38,151
The killer used it to slash Akane's throat.

264
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,551
You... you say that the obsidian was used as a knife?

265
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,151
And...

266
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:46,451
The thing that was used to shatter it was my hammer.

267
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,051
The place it was shattered was in the forest

268
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:50,851
where the hammer was found.

269
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:54,551
But no one would hear the loud sound of the stone being shattered.

270
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,451
I'm sure that weapon was made in the middle of the night

271
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,951
before it started raining.

272
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:03,451
That's why no footprints were found.

273
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,751
I see.

274
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:08,251
And, who is it? The killer that did it?

275
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:09,551
That's...

276
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:12,551
The one who saw the stone in the aquarium

277
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,251
and immediately took it to be an obsidian,

278
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,751
Mr. Raito Adachi.

279
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,551
You're the one who did it.

280
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,451
What...

281
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,551
Please wait a minute.

282
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:27,251
I'm made a killer

283
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,351
just because I'm knowledgeable about stones.

284
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:33,751
I'm sure that granny and Fuga also knew that the stone was an obsidian.

285
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,651
And yet, why me?

286
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:39,051
I turned my attention to you

287
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,051
when I saw your shoes.

288
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:41,751
Shoes?

289
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,651
If you hear the scream of a woman

290
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:46,151
you know very well from outside,

291
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,151
I wonder if there's a person who will attempt to wear his shoes?

292
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:52,951
-Huh? -It's quite troublesome to wear shoes.

293
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:56,051
The entrance of this house has a step,

294
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,951
so first you have to find your shoes,

295
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:01,051
then put your feet inside and get your heels into them too.

296
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:03,351
In the circumstance back then,

297
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:05,251
it's most likely that you don't wear shoes and run up to the door,

298
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,851
then check what's going on outside.

299
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:13,351
Just like Conan, granny and her grandson did.

300
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:16,351
But, you had your high-cut shoes on

301
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:19,551
and had your shoe strings tied nicely as well.

302
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,251
In other words, you didn't go out to see what was going on

303
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,551
but rather was there to begin with

304
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,251
and murdered Akane on the site.

305
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:28,951
That's what your shoes proved.

306
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,151
I can see that he is a probable suspect,

307
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:37,651
but I wonder if his having his shoes on is enough to call him the killer.

308
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:40,951
Like I said, I turned my attention to him

309
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,051
when I saw his shoes.

310
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,251
Attention?

311
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,351
What concluded my deduction as him being the killer is the hammer!

312
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:50,751
Hammer... but we don't know who stole it yet.

313
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,951
If granny or her grandson were going to make a weapon,

314
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,151
they would most likely use something that is in this house.

315
00:15:57,151 --> 00:16:01,051
Say for example something from the tool box that was in the shed.

316
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:03,151
Although the bag was left out in the corridor,

317
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:06,151
who knows when someone may get up.

318
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:09,751
Therefore, no one would dare take the hammer out of my bag.

319
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,551
I see, very true.

320
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,251
Just as you were saying,

321
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:17,651
the killer most probably decided to commit the murder

322
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:19,351
despite this being a trip and the number of people being limited,

323
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:23,551
but something happened last night that provoked the murder.

324
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,951
And, I don't know what kind of reason he used

325
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,151
but he lured Akane outside early in the morning.

326
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:34,751
Since no sound of argument or fighting was heard,

327
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:38,851
Akane probably agreed to leaving her room.

328
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:41,951
They got to the front entrance without anybody noticing them,

329
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,651
completely wore their shoes

330
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:46,751
and just when they were about to go outside, something happened.

331
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,251
Something? What was that?

332
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:51,651
Maybe Akane who came along willingly up to that time

333
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,751
realized that it was raining

334
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,951
and decided that she didn't want to go out.

335
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:59,151
Or, she may have sensed that something was wrong

336
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,151
when she heard Mitsuhiko's footsteps as he ran up the stairs.

337
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,051
What makes you so sure?

338
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:07,651
If not, nothing would've happened at the front entrance.

339
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,351
He probably didn't plan on killing her there.

340
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:14,351
You decided to killer there because you panicked.

341
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,251
You probably went out struggling with Akane,

342
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,251
slashed her throat with the weapon you had hiding on you,

343
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,251
and killed her.

344
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:29,551
After that you left Akane's body at the site,

345
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,551
ran back to the house,

346
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,051
after opening the sliding paper door beside the aquarium,

347
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,551
you headed outside once again.

348
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:37,651
You ran over to Akane who was lying on the ground

349
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,051
and carried her up.

350
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:42,451
He put on an act to make it look

351
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:44,951
as if he ran out after hearing her scream.

352
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:46,651
Because he had no way of hiding the blood

353
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,551
that was on his clothes and body.

354
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,451
Then...

355
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,551
where is the weapon?

356
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,551
If it hasn't been found yet,

357
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:57,651
it's probably still in the aquarium.

358
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:00,151
Just before you mentioned that you wanted to go the bathroom

359
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:01,951
to wash off her blood from yourself,

360
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,151
you were touching the aquarium,

361
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,351
so you probably put it in there then.

362
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,951
You most surely didn't have time to wipe it off,

363
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:13,051
so I'm sure it's still on the murder weapon,

364
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,851
Akane's blood and your fingerprints.

365
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,951
Having had it explained like that...

366
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,151
How about you?

367
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:27,951
Yes, I feel bad

368
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:29,751
towards those goldfish.

369
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,751
Goldfish?

370
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,551
I should be, shouldn't I?

371
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:36,551
I messed up their habitat

372
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,751
to kill a worthless woman like her.

373
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,551
But why?

374
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:44,851
Wasn't she one of your important customers?

375
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:49,051
I was planning to quit as a host in the near future.

376
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:50,351
Because my parents finally...

377
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:53,151
were about to repay the entire amount of money

378
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:55,951
they borrowed from the financial institution run by her father.

379
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,351
However, last night that woman...

380
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,051
Oh, the money that they borrowed

381
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,251
has ballooned to about three times what they originally borrowed.

382
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,051
-Huh? -I told your parents

383
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,251
that were some shares that would prospectively go up

384
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:08,251
and they fell for it.

385
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:10,851
I'm sure that they're looking pale right now,

386
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,851
because the shares of that company took a sharp plunge

387
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,551
after the president was arrested.

388
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,251
But, I've got to thank God over and over again

389
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,551
because now you'll be at my beck

390
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,851
and call for life, Raito.

391
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:32,551
I burst out in rage when that woman said that.

392
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,151
I was working as a host

393
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:35,951
because I had no choice having to pay back money.

394
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:38,151
So, I really had it tough.

395
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:42,151
I've always been a very old-fashioned person.

396
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,851
So, this job of having to be at the back and call of women,

397
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,651
wasn't my cup of tea.

398
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:49,151
But, I didn't think I'd be using...

399
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:52,251
such an outdated weapon to commit the murder.

400
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:58,651
I'll leave the rest to you.

401
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,551
Yes, sir!

402
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,751
What about this knife with the red handle?

403
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,451
Oh, I'll put that back.

404
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:10,551
Excuse me.

405
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,951
May I please take a look at that knife for a minute?

406
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,651
Go ahead.

407
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:15,751
Thank you.

408
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:19,251
"Shota"

409
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,351
This is...

410
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,751
Hey, young man...

411
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:27,751
if you know my grandson, please relay this message to him.

412
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,951
Tell him not to worry about me.

413
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:34,151
But, to above all take care of his body

414
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,451
and to take good care of himself.

415
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:42,951
Yeah, I'll relay your message to him.

416
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,351
So in exchange,

417
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:49,551
may I take this knife with me?

418
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:53,051
Because I'm sure that he'll really be happy if I give it to him.

419
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,151
Yeah, do that.

420
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:03,951
Huh? Did that granny know he was her grandson?

421
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,251
Yeah, most probably.

422
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:09,051
That's why she kept that knife hidden.

423
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,751
She was probably going to give it to him

424
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,251
when he came back a fine chef,

425
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,051
and kept polishing it every day very preciously.

426
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,951
But, she really looked as frightening as an ogre

427
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:21,451
as she was sharpening the knife.

428
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,751
It's just like the mask of the Hanya.

429
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,351
It looks scary

430
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,451
but at the same time you could say it looks sad, right?

431
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,351
I'm sure that she was sharpening it with all her might

432
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:34,251
while trying to hold back the pain she was feeling in her heart.

433
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,851
She probably polished the knife with the hope

434
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:40,751
that her grandson whose appearance and intention have changed

435
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:43,651
to return to where he started off.

436
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,151
The glitter of the mountain crone's knife

437
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:50,451
was the sad glitter

438
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:53,151
of the tears of a grandmother concerned about her grandson.

439
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:25,651
A month later,

440
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,951
I went to a Japanese restaurant with Ran.

441
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:30,951
I happened to see a young cook being scolded.

442
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,951
Too slow, Tanaka!

443
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,351
You still haven't finished cutting it?

444
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:35,851
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:40,451
The young cook who looked familiar

446
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:43,351
was trying with all his might to fillet a fish.

447
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:46,451
That cook was holding a knife with a red handle in his hand.

448
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,951
I'm sure that one day he will certainly...

449
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:52,751
Conan...

450
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:56,051
Too slow, Conan,

451
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:57,751
you still can't decide what you want?

452
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:03,151
She looked like a witch.

453
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,651
"Next Episode"

454
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,551
Fake police officer?

455
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,751
There are other people who saw him too, aren't there?

456
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:12,851
Let's split up and look for him!

457
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,151
-Okay! -Hey! You guys!

458
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:18,951
I've got to find him no matter what, and arrest him.

459
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,151
No, maybe he...

460
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:23,551
It's too reckless and dangerous!

461
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:25,951
That's it...

462
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:30,051
Next Conan!

463
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:34,051
"The Police Officer Who Disappeared"

464
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,151
Next Conan's Hint:

465
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:54,451
Last train of the day.

466
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,051
Chief, we'd better get going soon or you'll miss the last train.

467
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,951
Who cares, give me another glass of cider.

468
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:58,951
On the rocks.
