1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.840
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.340
Starting the year off is the Youth Detective Squad.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.240
Genta's rear end is more important than the monkey's rear end.

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51.368 --> 00:01:52.768
Hey! Is it for real

9
00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:55.568
that you and Haibara were almost kidnapped?

10
00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:58.768
Yes. But we somehow made it through safely.

11
00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:01.368
The kidnapper got away though.

12
00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:03.768
I'm really glad for you both!

13
00:02:03.768 --> 00:02:05.068
Since you both recovered from your cold

14
00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:07.068
and got to come to school!

15
00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:09.168
We were really worried about you!

16
00:02:09.168 --> 00:02:10.468
Thank you.

17
00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:12.068
I'm perfectly fine now.

18
00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:15.968
We actually wanted to go see you but...

19
00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.468
Conan insisted that we shouldn't go see you

20
00:02:18.468 --> 00:02:21.168
because we'd catch your cold. Right?

21
00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:22.168
Yes!

22
00:02:22.168 --> 00:02:24.168
Oh. Is that so?

23
00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:27.968
We even decided on what time to go see you and yet...

24
00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:29.568
Exactly!

25
00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:31.968
Now that I'm relieved, I'm starved.

26
00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:33.168
Not again!

27
00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:35.468
Hey.

28
00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:37.468
Are sure it's really safe?

29
00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:39.768
For me to go outside.

30
00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:41.668
Yeah, pretty much.

31
00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:43.968
For now.

32
00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:45.668
What do you mean "pretty much"?

33
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:48.068
I removed all the wiretap that was set up

34
00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.568
in Dr. Agasa's house.

35
00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:55.468
In fact, I went browsing around here alone last night.

36
00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:57.168
Disguised as you.

37
00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:02.668
I asked mom to help me disguise as you once more!

38
00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:06.168
Shinichi. You look just great!

39
00:03:06.168 --> 00:03:07.968
What do you think?

40
00:03:07.968 --> 00:03:09.568
You think so.

41
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:12.468
Doing something dangerous like that on your own again.

42
00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:13.968
There was nobody watching me

43
00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:17.168
or anybody suspicious following me.

44
00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:20.168
Well, I wouldn't say that it's completely safe,

45
00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:22.468
but I'm not the type who can stayed locked up

46
00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.768
just because I'm scared.

47
00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:28.568
I decided to believe her words for now.

48
00:03:28.568 --> 00:03:30.668
I lost.

49
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.368
I'll give up going after Sherry.

50
00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:34.768
Her words?

51
00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:38.068
Besides, you pretty much recovered too, haven't you?

52
00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:41.368
Isn't it because pressure from those guys disappeared?

53
00:03:45.268 --> 00:03:51.168
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 1)"

54
00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:56.668
What? An FBI agent?

55
00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:58.068
Sonoko!

56
00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.168
Really?

57
00:04:00.168 --> 00:04:02.168
Sonoko.

58
00:04:02.168 --> 00:04:04.368
But! You mean Jodie is?

59
00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:06.568
-No kidding? -Sonoko!

60
00:04:06.568 --> 00:04:10.068
This is a hospital! Be quiet!

61
00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:11.068
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:12.368
Don't worry about it.

63
00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:15.768
Why'd you think of working as an English teacher in Japan?

64
00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:18.068
Don't tell me that you're an undercover agent investigating something?

65
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:19.668
Sonoko...

66
00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:21.268
No. No!

67
00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:24.068
Oh. That's not it.

68
00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:26.068
There was a culprit I was after for a long time,

69
00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:28.768
but I carelessly lost track of that person.

70
00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.268
So, I was given time off from work for a while,

71
00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:33.168
that's why I came to Japan!

72
00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:39.668
I really love Japanese games!

73
00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:41.968
-Games? -Games?

74
00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:44.468
I became an English teacher,

75
00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:47.268
because I always wanted to be one for a long time!

76
00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:50.468
But, my time off has come to an end!

77
00:04:50.468 --> 00:04:52.668
As soon as the wound on my stomach heals,

78
00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:55.368
I have to head back to America!

79
00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:56.968
Then, the treasure map

80
00:04:56.968 --> 00:04:59.768
you said you'd been looking for all this time is...

81
00:04:59.768 --> 00:05:01.968
I got a call from my boss telling me to come home

82
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.268
because they got a clue to the culprit

83
00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:06.568
that I've been looking for!

84
00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:07.868
He said he's going to give me a chance

85
00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:09.168
to make things right again!

86
00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:11.368
I see.

87
00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:16.168
I wanted to say goodbye to cool kid before leaving too

88
00:05:16.168 --> 00:05:18.068
so I went to Dr. Agasa's house.

89
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.068
That's when I saw cool kid and Ai

90
00:05:20.068 --> 00:05:23.068
being pushed into the car and taken away

91
00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:24.568
by some suspicious looking people,

92
00:05:24.568 --> 00:05:26.168
so I went after them with my car!

93
00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.568
And I cornered them by a pier.

94
00:05:32.568 --> 00:05:35.368
They suddenly fired a gun at me.

95
00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:38.568
So, I did likewise!

96
00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:42.168
Of course, the gun was what I had taken

97
00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:44.568
from the suspicious people!

98
00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:46.268
But, I was definitely lucky!

99
00:05:46.268 --> 00:05:49.868
That Mouri was hiding in the trunk of the car.

100
00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.968
And that she protected Ai.

101
00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:55.068
Because back then, I was shot in the stomach

102
00:05:56.568 --> 00:05:57.768
and couldn't move.

103
00:05:57.768 --> 00:06:00.468
Moreover, the kidnappers were planning

104
00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:04.568
to give up kidnapping and kill the children!

105
00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:05.968
Really?

106
00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:07.068
Yes.

107
00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:11.168
I found the pictures of Conan and Shinichi hidden and pasted

108
00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:14.668
behind the mirror in the restroom of Jodie's condominium.

109
00:06:14.668 --> 00:06:18.768
So I went to Jodie's place to ask her about them.

110
00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:21.868
But, she wasn't home so I was ready to leave

111
00:06:21.868 --> 00:06:25.468
when I saw her car in front of her condominium.

112
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.968
The trunk of the car was open so I took the liberty of...

113
00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:31.168
So, you took the liberty of... I mean you know.

114
00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:35.068
But I'm sure glad

115
00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:38.468
that you weren't a bad person after all, Jodie!

116
00:06:38.468 --> 00:06:41.468
I mean, I thought that you were involved in some way

117
00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:42.768
with the case that Shinichi is involved in.

118
00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:44.468
And that you were being threatened by the culprit

119
00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:45.668
to take pictures of Shinichi

120
00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:49.768
to find out what his weaknesses were.

121
00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:51.568
I had every mind to confront the culprit directly

122
00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:53.268
and beat him up.

123
00:06:53.268 --> 00:06:55.768
Hey, Ran! Are you serious?

124
00:06:55.768 --> 00:06:58.668
I mean the things you think of are so unreal!

125
00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.768
Oh! Those pictures that are pasted there

126
00:07:00.768 --> 00:07:04.868
are people that I've befriended in Japan!

127
00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:06.068
What?

128
00:07:06.068 --> 00:07:09.768
I actually had them pasted on the living room board,

129
00:07:09.768 --> 00:07:11.968
but when one of my Japanese friends came over,

130
00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:13.968
she had a queer look on her face

131
00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.368
so I decided to move the pictures over to where they are now!

132
00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:17.568
I see!

133
00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:20.368
Americans often have pictures of their families

134
00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:23.868
all over the desk at their work place too.

135
00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:26.468
It's not too customary to do something like that in Japan

136
00:07:26.468 --> 00:07:29.068
so I guess it's only natural that it would be thought of as odd.

137
00:07:29.068 --> 00:07:32.568
Come to think of it, even when I went to watch an opera in New York.

138
00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:34.868
The actresses had a lot of pictures pasted all over the mirror

139
00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:38.168
of their dressing room.

140
00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:39.468
You mean the time when you and Shinichi

141
00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:42.568
were attacked by the serial killer!

142
00:07:42.568 --> 00:07:43.968
Take care.

143
00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:47.868
Because I've heard that they appear in this area recently too!

144
00:07:47.868 --> 00:07:49.968
-We will. -We will.

145
00:07:51.668 --> 00:07:54.468
Somebody's here.

146
00:07:54.468 --> 00:07:58.368
I guess we'd better be going then.

147
00:07:58.368 --> 00:08:00.768
I hope you get well soon, Jodie!

148
00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:02.668
Thank you so much, both of you!

149
00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:04.068
-Please excuse us. -Please excuse us.

150
00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:09.668
How are you doing?

151
00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:11.468
All right, somehow...

152
00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:14.768
the shot fortunately missed my vital point.

153
00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:16.768
By the way, were the Japanese police

154
00:08:16.768 --> 00:08:19.068
convinced with the explanation we gave them?

155
00:08:19.068 --> 00:08:20.168
Yeah.

156
00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:21.568
After hearing the siren of the police car,

157
00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:26.468
one of the kidnappers took the boy hostage and fled.

158
00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:30.268
Then he disappeared leaving the car and the boy behind in the forest.

159
00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:33.068
The other one whose leg was fractured

160
00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:35.568
committed suicide with the gun he had on him.

161
00:08:35.568 --> 00:08:36.968
Unfortunately,

162
00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:38.868
since it was the dark, neither you nor the children

163
00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:42.468
could see the face of the kidnapper who fled.

164
00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:47.168
Of course I made both children say the same thing.

165
00:08:47.168 --> 00:08:51.668
I didn't want to create a sensation by publicizing that

166
00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:54.968
the kidnapper was actress Chris Vineyard after we failed to arrest her

167
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.668
on top of not knowing what the actual motive of the kidnapping was.

168
00:08:57.668 --> 00:09:00.968
We also felt bad about making you work undercover here

169
00:09:00.968 --> 00:09:04.768
without acquiring permission from the Japanese police, so...

170
00:09:04.768 --> 00:09:10.368
The problem is that girl who was called Sherry by that woman.

171
00:09:14.868 --> 00:09:17.368
I wonder if she'll accept

172
00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:19.368
our request?

173
00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:26.668
Well, it seems like the FBI is in on this too

174
00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:30.168
so I'm sure they can't make any moves that easily either!

175
00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:31.368
Come to think of it,

176
00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:34.168
Dr. Agasa said that you got a phone call from Jodie

177
00:09:34.168 --> 00:09:35.468
this morning.

178
00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:37.768
What did she want?

179
00:09:37.768 --> 00:09:41.868
Was it to verify whether we didn't contradict each other?

180
00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:44.468
Well, I guess so.

181
00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:48.968
I'll be frank with you.

182
00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:53.368
We would like you to accept the witness protection program.

183
00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:55.768
Back then, Chris Vineyard.

184
00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:59.168
Yes. The lady called Vermouth,

185
00:09:59.168 --> 00:10:02.368
tried to kill you to keep you from talking.

186
00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.268
In other words, it's obvious that

187
00:10:04.268 --> 00:10:09.268
you have information that she finds very inconvenient.

188
00:10:09.268 --> 00:10:11.468
About the witness protection program,

189
00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:14.068
I think you already know it from movies and novels.

190
00:10:14.068 --> 00:10:17.168
It will change everything from your name, background and address

191
00:10:17.168 --> 00:10:19.368
to a totally different identity

192
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:21.068
in order to protect you

193
00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:23.568
from the people who are after your life.

194
00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:24.968
You will be guaranteed sufficient income

195
00:10:24.968 --> 00:10:28.568
and other miscellaneous things from the country for life

196
00:10:28.568 --> 00:10:31.368
and I will see to it that you get to live a happy life.

197
00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:34.568
Of course whether you want to accept this or not is up to you.

198
00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:35.868
However, once you accept it,

199
00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:40.768
you will not be able to see or call your family and friends.

200
00:10:40.768 --> 00:10:44.468
If you're afraid of that woman coming after you in revenge,

201
00:10:44.468 --> 00:10:48.668
if you don't want to get your friends involved,

202
00:10:48.668 --> 00:10:50.568
I'll be waiting for you to give me a good answer.

203
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:53.468
What's up Haibara?

204
00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:56.368
Maybe because of her cold.

205
00:10:56.368 --> 00:10:57.868
No, that's not it.

206
00:10:57.868 --> 00:10:59.668
It's been a while since I came outside,

207
00:10:59.668 --> 00:11:01.868
so I'm just a bit tired.

208
00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:03.968
Then, bye. Because I'm going this way.

209
00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:05.268
See you tomorrow!

210
00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:06.768
I'll see you at school!

211
00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:07.968
Okay!

212
00:11:13.468 --> 00:11:15.468
"I feel great."

213
00:11:15.468 --> 00:11:19.968
"Splashing in the rain."

214
00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:35.168
It hurts...

215
00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:38.468
Serial Killer!

216
00:11:38.468 --> 00:11:40.568
Somebody, get him!

217
00:11:46.168 --> 00:11:47.468
It's Ayumi's voice.

218
00:11:58.068 --> 00:12:00.768
-What's up? -Ayumi!

219
00:12:00.768 --> 00:12:01.968
Ayumi?

220
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.790
I see.

221
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.990
So, you don't remember that person's face.

222
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.390
Yes.

223
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.990
It was raining and he was wearing my raincoat and hat.

224
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.490
Besides, I was so scared I couldn't look at the person's face!

225
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.690
Even the lady victim who got her armed slashed

226
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.790
didn't see the culprit's face.

227
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.990
Judging from the way things look,

228
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.190
the culprit is probably the same as the one

229
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.390
who committed the other three previous cases.

230
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.590
But, the outfit is different.

231
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.890
I heard the person shout.

232
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.890
I'm sure it was a man!

233
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.490
But, you can't really tell just from a shouting voice.

234
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.590
Either way,

235
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.090
let's go to the scene of the crime and do an inspection!

236
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.890
Maybe you'll remember something.

237
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.890
Okay!

238
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.790
I bumped into the serial killer over here.

239
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.190
We heard Ayumi scream

240
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.190
so we came running over!

241
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.090
Which means that the culprit ran away

242
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.490
because you and the others came?

243
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.390
No!

244
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.790
He ran away before that!

245
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.990
Really?

246
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.290
Before he ran away, he came towards me once,

247
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.590
so I was surprised but...

248
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.890
He came towards you?

249
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.890
Yep!

250
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.290
I heard a clinking sound afterwards

251
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.590
so I'm sure he picked something up!

252
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.490
Maybe he dropped loose change or something?

253
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.890
Maybe it was his glasses or house key.

254
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.890
It could've been a necklace or bracelet.

255
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.290
Do you know what the culprit picked up?

256
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.590
No.

257
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.290
I think it has something to do with the number 5!

258
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.990
The number 5?

259
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.790
Because there's a mark that looks like the number 5

260
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.490
on the palm of my hand!

261
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.890
I looked around the area after that

262
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.790
but I saw nothing on the ground.

263
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.790
Can you draw a picture of the mark for me?

264
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.190
Yes, I can.

265
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.790
It looked like this.

266
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.190
It doesn't look like a 50 yen coin or a 500 yen coin either.

267
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.690
It kind of looks like the letter S of the alphabet too.

268
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.890
Well, I'll try go look for traces of this mark.

269
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.790
It could be a mark left behind by some coin

270
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.390
from a slot machine game center or something.

271
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.690
There he is!

272
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.690
-What? -Why you!

273
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.790
Excuse us!

274
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.490
Don't let him get away!

275
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.790
Darn it! It's so hard to get through with so many onlookers.

276
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.090
There he is! The man in the raincoat!

277
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.790
There's the serial killer.

278
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.490
Wait! That's...

279
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.190
Why you...

280
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.290
It's Officer Takagi.

281
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.690
Geez! She's right, it's Officer Takagi.

282
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.890
It hurts...

283
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.090
What a thing to do.

284
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.590
Hey, Officer Takagi.

285
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.790
Didn't a man wearing a raincoat come running this way?

286
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.890
There are so many of them here.

287
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.390
Because it just stopped raining.

288
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.190
But, how bold.

289
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.690
To come back wearing a raincoat to the site of the crime,

290
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.790
knowing that the police are conducting investigations.

291
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.790
Yeah.

292
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.090
The culprit probably thinks that no one would expect him

293
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.990
to come back in the same clothes.

294
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.490
Don't tell me that he came back to take revenge thinking

295
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.090
that Ayumi had seen his face?

296
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.890
No way.

297
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.690
He probably came back because he was positive

298
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.090
that she didn't see his face!

299
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.390
For what?

300
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.890
Beats me.

301
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.290
He may have forgotten something at the site

302
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.690
that he shouldn't have left behind.

303
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.590
Or, maybe he came back to confirm something.

304
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.090
Darn it. I'm all wet.

305
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.390
At any rate, we'll have to figure out

306
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.690
what this mark that Ayumi drew is.

307
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.290
Hey!

308
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.990
Genta?

309
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.090
Your buttocks, Genta.

310
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.190
What? Is it ripped or something?

311
00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.790
That's not it!

312
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.290
The mark that the serial killer left behind is there!

313
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.690
What? No kidding?

314
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.590
That means he must've come in contact with the culprit somewhere.

315
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.590
Genta, please try and remember!

316
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.090
Where were you?

317
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.390
Please answer, Genta!

318
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.390
Where did you get that mark on?

319
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.990
The mark of the serial killer that is on your buttocks!

320
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.190
I wonder if this is really a mark left behind by the serial killer?

321
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.290
Yes!

322
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.090
It looks just like the mark on the thing that the culprit dropped!

323
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.690
I coincidentally pressed my hand against it,

324
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:34.790
when the culprit got flustered,

325
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.490
came back to get it and then fled.

326
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.090
After that, the same mark was left on the palm of my hand.

327
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.890
Which means that Kojima touched the culprit

328
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.890
or the culprit's belongings somewhere along the line.

329
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.390
It could've been when you went after the culprit

330
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.890
who was among the crowd

331
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.190
and wearing a raincoat, went fleeing!

332
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.490
But...

333
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.690
Although I did trip over the bag of somebody in the crowd,

334
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.190
staggered and bumped into a bicycle,

335
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.290
it wasn't the culprit!

336
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.190
Besides...

337
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.890
It's nothing.

338
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.890
Could it be that the mark that was on the bag and the bicycle

339
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.490
were the same as the mark on the culprit's belongings?

340
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.890
If so, it could've been a name brand item.

341
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.590
Let's go back to the site

342
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.990
and ask the people in the area!

343
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.090
Besides the owners of the bag and the bicycle

344
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.090
may still be there.

345
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.190
Officer Sato...

346
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.090
Yes.

347
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.690
Come on, Conan. Let's go!

348
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.290
Yeah.

349
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.790
It's strange.

350
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.890
-The mark that is on Genta's buttocks. -The mark...

351
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.190
looks familiar.

352
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.990
Oh! There!

353
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.090
I tripped over this man's bag!

354
00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.390
But there's nothing that looks like that mark on the bag.

355
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.990
Besides, the bag isn't dirty at all

356
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.790
so I don't think this is the one.

357
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.090
Because the mark on Genta's buttocks

358
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.990
looked to be soiled with mud.

359
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.790
If he was soiled with mud,

360
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.890
maybe the bicycle is a better bet?

361
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.890
And, where is that bicycle?

362
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.190
There she is!

363
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.490
She's the lady!

364
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.890
It's true that it is soiled with mud but...

365
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.790
The mark doesn't seem to be there.

366
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.990
Where on earth did you get

367
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.090
that number 5 or the letter S looking mark on you?

368
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.790
It's neither a 5 nor a S.

369
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.490
The mark that is on the palm of Ayumi's hand

370
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.690
and Genta's buttocks

371
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.690
is a reverse and mirrored image of the actual shape.

372
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.190
In other words, the actual shape

373
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.090
is a shape that is the opposite of the number 5 or letter S.

374
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.590
Oh, I see!

375
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.290
And what about the size of the mark?

376
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.390
If that something left this big a mark on Ayumi's palm,

377
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.790
I think that she would have an idea of what it is.

378
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.290
No. Mine was much smaller!

379
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.590
It was here. About the size of a one yen coin!

380
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:08.290
Which means that the two were the same mark on separate things.

381
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.090
If it was that small,

382
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.990
it could've been an accessory of the same brand.

383
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.290
Mirrored image.

384
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.090
Accessory.

385
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.890
The mark on the sleeve.

386
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.790
Don't tell me that...

387
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.090
Officer Sato?

388
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.690
This! It's this mark!

389
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.390
The car...

390
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.690
Yes.

391
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.990
After I drove through a muddy road,

392
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.190
I didn't wash the car

393
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.690
so those traces were left behind.

394
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.590
Come to think of it, you were sitting on the hood of Officer Sato's car,

395
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.290
weren't you, Genta?

396
00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.890
Yeah...

397
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.190
Why didn't you tell us right away?

398
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.290
Well, it crossed my mind to begin with

399
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.890
but I didn't say anything.

400
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.190
But I thought it can't be...

401
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.890
that Officer Sato was a serial killer!

402
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.890
I'm not!

403
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.290
The culprit probably has the same model car as I do!

404
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.390
Then, the mark that was on my palm...

405
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.390
Is the key to the car of this model!

406
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.990
The car's master key that has a cover

407
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.990
with the mark etched on it.

408
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.490
See!

409
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.790
No kidding!

410
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.290
As proof of it, look at the tip of Ayumi's sleeve!

411
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.090
See the zigzag vertical lines on it?

412
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.790
-Yes. -True.

413
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.090
That's probably because there was dirt on the tip of the key

414
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.290
and when it was pressed against her hand,

415
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.190
traces of it stuck on to the tip of her sleeve...

416
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.390
No, it's not dirt.

417
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.590
It's discolored and black, but this is...

418
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.090
Blood?

419
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.790
Maybe the reason why the culprit came back here is...

420
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.090
Yes.

421
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:55.090
Probably to check whether Ayumi saw this mark.

422
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.490
And after seeing our undercover police car,

423
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.390
the culprit probably figured out that

424
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.490
it would be a matter of time before everything is disclosed.

425
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.890
Then, we'd better hurry or the culprit will get away!

426
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.490
Officer Takagi, get a hold of Inspector Megure

427
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.490
and have him set up a cordon!

428
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.490
Check all the drivers that are driving cars with the same mark

429
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.990
that are trying to leave this area!

430
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.490
Yes!

431
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.090
Also check all the residents in this area

432
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.990
who own the same car model!

433
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.390
If the culprit is a person who will risk coming back to confirm

434
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.190
whether the model of his car had been specified,

435
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.790
it's likely that he has a parking space or storeroom nearby!

436
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.590
Okay!

437
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.190
But, what if there are many cars like it?

438
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.990
It'd be very hard looking for it.

439
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.390
No, I don't think there are that many.

440
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:46.290
The model of this car with this mark on the key

441
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.790
and body is pretty old and manufacturing of it

442
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.590
stopped about seven or eight years ago.

443
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.890
Besides, it was raining when the crime was committed.

444
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.290
If we were to search for a culprit whose car is wet in the rain,

445
00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.790
with no alibi and who has lost his master key,

446
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.990
the criteria for the search would be drastically narrowed down.

447
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.790
Why doesn't the culprit have the master key?

448
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.890
He probably had it but dropped it.

449
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.790
A blood stain in the shape of a key

450
00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.890
was left on the sleeve of Ayumi's outfit.

451
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.190
This serves as proof that the culprit grabbed the key with hands

452
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.190
soiled with the blood of the victim and fled!

453
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:20.290
This means that the culprit will not show the police the key,

454
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.290
which he knows will display haematological response!

455
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.490
"Next Episode" -Just what does this mean, Officer Takagi?

456
00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.590
You said so confidently that this would specify the culprit.

457
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.390
Silly. It's not the key that's being checked.

458
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.990
There's a possibility that the culprit would come

459
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.490
to take revenge on anyone who was involved with you too.

460
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.890
I'll go see him, after all.

461
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.090
Open the door, will you?

462
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.890
Bye-bye.

463
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.090
Next Conan,

464
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.790
"Look for the Mark on the Buttocks (Part 2)"

465
00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.759
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:27.859
"Key cylinder"

467
00:24:27.859 --> 00:24:29.459
-The next episode... -Genta's buttocks...

468
00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:31.059
-Stop it! -Genta's buttocks...

469
00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:32.759
Genta's buttocks
