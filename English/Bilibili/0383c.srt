1
00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.834
Strike! Batter out!

2
00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:11.834
Kubota gets three strikes and is out!

3
00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:12.834
But in this inning,

4
00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:17.034
Konan High School scored a run from Nagashima's home run.

5
00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.934
Ohgane High School are trying to make up for it now.

6
00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:21.834
In the batter box is number eight, Watanabe.

7
00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.734
Sakuraba throws against Watanabe.

8
00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.034
A hit.

9
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.434
Right down to the middle.

10
00:00:58.734 --> 00:00:59.834
Out!

11
00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:04.934
Konan High School third baseman,

12
00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:07.534
Nagashima is really showing his skills in this game.

13
00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:19.834
Strike!

14
00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.634
Inao's third pitch against Sakuraba.

15
00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:39.434
Here it comes!

16
00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:41.234
Strike! Batter out!

17
00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.934
A swing and a strike out.

18
00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.334
Konan High School with no runs in this inning.

19
00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:49.934
As the fifth inning comes to a close, the score is 0-1.

20
00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:51.534
Konan High School is still with a one run lead

21
00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:54.634
from Nagashima's home run in the fourth.

22
00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:45.334
Out!

23
00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:59.134
Top of the sixth inning, hitting for Konan High School

24
00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:03.134
is number nine, second baseman, Michishita.

25
00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:05.034
Kudo?

26
00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:06.734
How about it? Did you find it?

27
00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.634
No. I searched all through the fourth aisle,

28
00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:11.834
but it's nowhere.

29
00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:13.634
And how about you?

30
00:03:13.634 --> 00:03:15.234
Same here.

31
00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:18.334
I guess we'll just have to decipher

32
00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:20.334
the meaning of the figure 47.

33
00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:23.734
Hey, Hattori.

34
00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:26.534
What is it, Kudo?

35
00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:28.034
At Koshien,

36
00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:30.234
there's nothing that is gold, is there?

37
00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:34.534
Well, at Koshien the gold would be...

38
00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:35.934
"Ginsan".

39
00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:38.434
Huh? You mean there is something called that?

40
00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:40.434
You can see it, can't you?

41
00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:43.534
The big roof hooked onto the ceiling behind the back net,

42
00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:45.434
that's it.

43
00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.334
Then, there's no doubt about it.

44
00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:49.434
The second cell phone is there!

45
00:03:49.434 --> 00:03:51.334
Huh? Why?

46
00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:52.534
You know, don't you?

47
00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:55.134
47 is gold.

48
00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.434
That's right!

49
00:03:56.434 --> 00:04:00.134
47 is the atomic number for gold!

50
00:04:00.134 --> 00:04:03.134
Let's go outside and go in behind the back net

51
00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:04.434
and check the seats in the fourth aisle.

52
00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:06.134
But I wonder if we'll make it in time?

53
00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:08.634
The seats under the "ginsan" behind the back net

54
00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:10.334
has 100 seats an aisle.

55
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:12.234
If we try checking every seat from now,

56
00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:14.434
three outs and that's it!

57
00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.834
Then maybe it's first base or third base?

58
00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.634
Because there's a 3 under 47.

59
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.934
Idiot!

60
00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:23.134
You just checked there.

61
00:04:23.134 --> 00:04:24.934
There's got to be something else.

62
00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.234
Number three on the back of the uniform

63
00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:28.334
that would indicate a seat under "ginsan".

64
00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:33.134
I got it.

65
00:04:33.134 --> 00:04:34.834
There is one, Kudo!

66
00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:37.734
Another number three, on the back of the uniform!

67
00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:42.134
Mr. Ohtaki!

68
00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:43.934
Heiji.

69
00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:46.034
Did you figure out the code?

70
00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:47.534
Yes.

71
00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:50.134
The first 47 stands for "ginsan",

72
00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:53.634
and the next three in the parenthesis is...

73
00:04:55.034 --> 00:04:57.634
the one wearing the number three on the back of his uniform,

74
00:04:57.634 --> 00:04:59.534
the Bay Bruce monument!

75
00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:04.634
Which means that the location of the 2nd cell phone is...

76
00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:06.634
The location of this monument

77
00:05:06.634 --> 00:05:09.434
is slightly left from the centre.

78
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.834
In other words,

79
00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:15.534
under "ginsan", slightly left from the center behind the back net

80
00:05:15.534 --> 00:05:18.534
and a seat in the fourth aisle!

81
00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:30.234
What is it?

82
00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:32.034
What's up?

83
00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:34.434
The player made first base because the catcher fumbled.

84
00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:36.234
But we've got to hurry.

85
00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:37.734
It's two outs already.

86
00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:38.834
There's only one more out to go!

87
00:05:40.134 --> 00:05:42.734
-Ball! -Ball!

88
00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:44.534
Two three!

89
00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:45.534
It's the bottom of the sixth inning.

90
00:05:45.534 --> 00:05:48.634
It's two out with a runner on first base because of a fumble.

91
00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:50.034
Count two three.

92
00:05:50.034 --> 00:05:51.934
If this batter walks,

93
00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:56.734
next in line is Konan's big slugger, who scored a homerun.

94
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:01.934
Okay, the pitcher gets a hold of himself

95
00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:04.934
and from set position, throws his sixth ball.

96
00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:05.934
The ball's been hit.

97
00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.934
It's a foul fly.

98
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:13.334
But the ball flies in front of the Konan bench by first base.

99
00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:14.634
The catcher stops going after the ball.

100
00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:16.934
The pitcher.

101
00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:20.134
The pitcher goes after the ball and dashes into the Konan bench!

102
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:26.134
Is the pitcher all right?

103
00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:33.134
He caught the ball! He caught it!

104
00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:37.334
The fantastic play of the pitcher and it's three out change!

105
00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:39.334
Amazing!

106
00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:41.234
Talk about being reckless.

107
00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:47.934
I wonder if all boys are that way.

108
00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:48.934
Huh?

109
00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:52.434
This is indeed the finals of the Koshien.

110
00:06:52.434 --> 00:06:54.734
The passion that the players display towards the ball can't help

111
00:06:54.734 --> 00:06:56.834
but has touched the hearts of all who are watching!

112
00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.534
Hey, you stupid idiot!

113
00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:19.134
Listen, I'm going to find the third cell phone right away

114
00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:20.934
and get a hold of where you are

115
00:07:20.934 --> 00:07:23.534
so you can look forward to me getting to you real soon, you fool!

116
00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:29.934
Darn it! He hung up without saying anything.

117
00:07:29.934 --> 00:07:31.634
Come to think of it, Heiji.

118
00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:33.534
You know the Takano Transport case?

119
00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:37.234
According to what my superior told me,

120
00:07:37.234 --> 00:07:41.634
the truck of that company ran over a person a month ago in Tokyo,

121
00:07:41.634 --> 00:07:44.534
and it seemed one person died.

122
00:07:44.534 --> 00:07:47.934
Maybe that accident has something to do with this?

123
00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:51.834
But what does that have to do with Koshien?

124
00:07:51.834 --> 00:07:54.534
I still don't know but...

125
00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:55.934
Well, never mind.

126
00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.734
Let's just nab the guy and ask him directly.

127
00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:03.134
We already know how to decipher the code, so...

128
00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:07.534
What's this?

129
00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:10.934
Only the number of aisle is written here.

130
00:08:12.334 --> 00:08:14.534
No hint.

131
00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:32.834
Hiroshi.

132
00:09:06.997 --> 00:09:08.297
Why?

133
00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:10.897
Why is only the aisle number of the seats written?

134
00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:17.797
Maybe it's because you shouted at him furiously on the phone a while ago?

135
00:09:19.697 --> 00:09:22.297
I'm going to find the 3rd cell phone right away

136
00:09:22.297 --> 00:09:24.297
and get a hold of where you are,

137
00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.797
so you can look forward to me getting to you real soon, you fool!

138
00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:32.997
Darn it! He hung up without saying anything.

139
00:09:32.997 --> 00:09:35.697
If the guy's saying that he's going to commit suicide using a bomb,

140
00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:37.797
it's not surprising that he'd get pissed at what you said

141
00:09:37.797 --> 00:09:41.097
and decided not to give you any clue!

142
00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.097
Idiot!

143
00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:43.597
If he was one to get pissed over something like that,

144
00:09:43.597 --> 00:09:45.697
he would've pushed the switch for the bomb long ago

145
00:09:45.697 --> 00:09:49.297
and the stand somewhere here would be in bad trouble!

146
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:51.097
There's some kind of meaning to it.

147
00:09:51.097 --> 00:09:53.597
The blank in this code.

148
00:09:53.597 --> 00:09:56.597
It's indicating some stand of Koshien here.

149
00:10:06.197 --> 00:10:09.197
But what an odd guy.

150
00:10:09.197 --> 00:10:10.897
If he really wants to commit suicide,

151
00:10:10.897 --> 00:10:13.597
why would he give out complicated clues

152
00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:16.797
and make people look for where he is?

153
00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:20.497
Maybe he wants somebody to stop him?

154
00:10:20.497 --> 00:10:21.597
-Huh? -Huh?

155
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.397
I'm sure that person

156
00:10:24.397 --> 00:10:27.697
is hoping deep down in his heart that somebody will stop him.

157
00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:29.997
And maybe he doesn't even realize it himself.

158
00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:32.597
He wants somebody to stop him?

159
00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:35.397
Because the code that he thought up

160
00:10:35.397 --> 00:10:40.397
cannot be made unless he is interested in Koshien or baseball.

161
00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:44.797
It's hard to believe that such a person

162
00:10:44.797 --> 00:10:47.797
would want to do something like that at Koshien,

163
00:10:47.797 --> 00:10:50.697
much less use a bomb to commit suicide, right?

164
00:10:50.697 --> 00:10:53.197
I guess so.

165
00:10:53.197 --> 00:10:54.897
Mr. Ohtaki.

166
00:10:54.897 --> 00:10:55.897
Huh?

167
00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:58.297
Please call the Hyogo Prefectural police once more

168
00:10:58.297 --> 00:11:01.097
and ask them for more detailed information

169
00:11:01.097 --> 00:11:03.697
about the traffic accident a month ago,

170
00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:07.097
that Takano Transport the man set fire with a bomb that was involved in.

171
00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:08.597
I also want to know what the motive of a baseball fan

172
00:11:08.597 --> 00:11:12.597
who would do something like this at Koshien is, too.

173
00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:14.297
Okay.

174
00:11:14.297 --> 00:11:17.797
Then, shall we think about this code

175
00:11:17.797 --> 00:11:20.397
and look through the seats in the 13th row?

176
00:11:20.397 --> 00:11:22.997
Just look at each and every seat

177
00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:24.897
until the time limit when the bottom of the ninth inning ends.

178
00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:27.597
Let's do so.

179
00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:31.397
Who know whether there'll be a bottom of the ninth inning or not though.

180
00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:32.697
I see!

181
00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:36.697
Unless Ohgane who is batting first, catches up or wins the score,

182
00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.297
the top of the ninth inning will be the end of the game.

183
00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:41.697
The game is at the top of eight,

184
00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:42.997
one out, runner on third.

185
00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:45.497
Ohgane High School has a chance to even the score.

186
00:11:52.897 --> 00:11:55.397
The pitcher gets into set position.

187
00:11:56.697 --> 00:11:57.997
The third runner has dashed off!

188
00:11:57.997 --> 00:11:58.997
It's a squeeze!

189
00:12:03.197 --> 00:12:04.897
It's a short fly in front of the pitcher!

190
00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.497
He caught the ball! He caught it!

191
00:12:13.497 --> 00:12:15.097
It's a direct catch by the third!

192
00:12:17.297 --> 00:12:20.197
The ball goes to third base and it's a double play!

193
00:12:20.197 --> 00:12:22.897
Home base is far for Ohgane High School!

194
00:12:22.897 --> 00:12:23.897
It's the top of the eighth inning

195
00:12:23.897 --> 00:12:24.897
and though they've establish opportunities,

196
00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:25.897
they haven't scored a point yet!

197
00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:31.497
The score is still 0-1. It is the bottom of the eighth inning

198
00:12:31.497 --> 00:12:34.297
and Konan High School will be batting.

199
00:12:34.297 --> 00:12:37.697
Yes.

200
00:12:37.697 --> 00:12:39.397
Huh?

201
00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:42.097
Huh? A high school student?

202
00:12:42.097 --> 00:12:45.397
Are you sure that the one who was run over by the truck

203
00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.597
was a high school student?

204
00:12:47.597 --> 00:12:48.997
Yes.

205
00:12:48.997 --> 00:12:53.397
I was in charge of that accident together with a colleague

206
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:56.097
who was appointed to the Metropolitan police in Tokyo.

207
00:12:56.097 --> 00:12:59.697
I asked for all kinds of details.

208
00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:01.297
Here it is.

209
00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:03.997
I'm sure that you would know since you like high school baseball, right?

210
00:13:07.597 --> 00:13:10.097
The name Hiroshi Torimitsu.

211
00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:12.197
Yes.

212
00:13:12.197 --> 00:13:14.897
In the first game during the spring selection,

213
00:13:14.897 --> 00:13:16.197
the left hander of Teito Jitsugyo High school,

214
00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:19.597
who threw 18 extended games along with Ohgane's ace,

215
00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:21.797
but lost by a close game.

216
00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:23.897
Don't tell me it was that boy?

217
00:13:23.897 --> 00:13:25.097
Right.

218
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:27.997
He seems to have dashed out into the road after baseball club practice

219
00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:29.497
and was run over.

220
00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:45.597
Well, it seems that the boy's bicycle was moving unsteadily to begin with.

221
00:13:45.597 --> 00:13:48.697
Something about he had been over practicing baseball.

222
00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.997
Come to think of it, since the accident,

223
00:13:53.997 --> 00:13:55.797
the whereabouts of the boy's father have been unknown,

224
00:13:55.797 --> 00:13:58.497
so they were having problems not being able to ask questions.

225
00:14:00.097 --> 00:14:01.297
Don't tell me that...

226
00:14:05.097 --> 00:14:06.197
Father.

227
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.297
Strike!

228
00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:16.697
I'm going to give it my best shot.

229
00:14:20.597 --> 00:14:22.397
I'm going to do even better

230
00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:25.497
during the summer Koshien,

231
00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:27.097
become a professional,

232
00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:28.997
and make money

233
00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:30.597
so that you won't have to work that hard.

234
00:14:33.397 --> 00:14:34.997
You can count on me.

235
00:14:43.397 --> 00:14:44.397
Father.

236
00:14:47.797 --> 00:14:49.597
Hiroshi.

237
00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.597
Hey, Kudo. Did you find it?

238
00:15:00.597 --> 00:15:02.997
No, it's nowhere.

239
00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:07.597
It seems that it's nowhere in the seats of this back net.

240
00:15:07.597 --> 00:15:08.697
Darn it!

241
00:15:08.697 --> 00:15:11.897
Why is everything else besides 13 blank?

242
00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:12.897
The least he could do

243
00:15:12.897 --> 00:15:15.497
is write the number on back of the uniform in parenthesis!

244
00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:16.797
Hey, Hattori.

245
00:15:17.797 --> 00:15:19.597
Maybe it's that...

246
00:15:19.597 --> 00:15:22.397
There's a player with no number on the back of his uniform near the bench.

247
00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:25.797
Right.

248
00:15:25.797 --> 00:15:27.297
The ball boy, right?

249
00:15:27.297 --> 00:15:28.797
I thought so, too.

250
00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:32.197
I've checked the seats on the 13th aisle behind both benches,

251
00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:33.797
but found nothing.

252
00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:38.997
Then all that's left are the Alps stand or outfield seats.

253
00:15:49.997 --> 00:15:51.497
Strike! Batter out!

254
00:15:54.997 --> 00:15:57.397
Called out on strike, two out!

255
00:15:57.397 --> 00:15:59.697
Ohgane High School's tie runner

256
00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:02.297
cannot budge an inch from second base.

257
00:16:02.297 --> 00:16:06.897
Konan High School is only one player away from winning the championship.

258
00:16:06.897 --> 00:16:10.797
No good! If the game ends the man's going to blow himself up!

259
00:16:10.797 --> 00:16:11.797
Darn it!

260
00:16:11.797 --> 00:16:14.497
We don't have time to go around the Alps stands nor the outfield seats!

261
00:16:14.497 --> 00:16:15.997
What is this?

262
00:16:15.997 --> 00:16:18.297
Why is there nothing written?

263
00:16:18.297 --> 00:16:20.397
That fact that nothing is written...

264
00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:23.397
A zero? Nothing? White?

265
00:16:40.997 --> 00:16:42.997
He hit the ball!

266
00:16:42.997 --> 00:16:45.597
An interesting ball that goes up left!

267
00:16:45.597 --> 00:16:47.197
Can he catch it?

268
00:16:47.197 --> 00:16:48.897
Can he pull through?

269
00:16:48.897 --> 00:16:50.597
Will the scores be reversed?

270
00:16:50.597 --> 00:16:52.197
Will the game end?

271
00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:57.297
Don't catch the ball, you idiot!

272
00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:20.077
Konan High School is only one player away from winning the championship.

273
00:17:20.077 --> 00:17:24.277
No good! If the game ends the man's going to blow himself up!

274
00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:25.377
Darn it!

275
00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:28.177
We don't have time to go around the Alps stands nor the outfield seats!

276
00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:29.577
What is this?

277
00:17:29.577 --> 00:17:31.977
Why is there nothing written?

278
00:17:31.977 --> 00:17:33.977
That fact that nothing is written...

279
00:17:33.977 --> 00:17:37.177
A zero? Nothing? White?

280
00:17:54.477 --> 00:17:56.477
He hit the ball!

281
00:17:56.477 --> 00:17:58.977
An interesting ball that goes up left!

282
00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.677
Can he catch it?

283
00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:02.377
Can he pull through?

284
00:18:02.377 --> 00:18:04.177
Will the scores be reversed?

285
00:18:04.177 --> 00:18:05.677
Will the game end?

286
00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:11.077
Don't catch the ball, you idiot!

287
00:18:13.277 --> 00:18:14.777
He missed the ball, he missed!

288
00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:16.477
Okay! It's a tie!

289
00:18:17.677 --> 00:18:19.677
Missed?

290
00:18:19.677 --> 00:18:21.977
Wait a second. If I'm not mistaken...

291
00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:24.077
While the ball goes travelling outfield,

292
00:18:24.077 --> 00:18:26.577
the batter runners go from second to third base.

293
00:18:26.577 --> 00:18:28.877
Hey, Kudo? What's up?

294
00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:33.377
The runner dashes out from third base!

295
00:18:35.277 --> 00:18:37.577
The ball goes from hook-up to back home!

296
00:18:50.577 --> 00:18:51.777
Safe!

297
00:18:54.777 --> 00:18:56.977
A running homerun.

298
00:18:56.977 --> 00:18:58.277
Fantastic!

299
00:18:58.277 --> 00:18:59.777
They reversed the score!

300
00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:11.577
Heiji, what's up?

301
00:19:11.577 --> 00:19:14.777
Did you find out about something?

302
00:19:14.777 --> 00:19:16.977
Ask this kid here.

303
00:19:16.977 --> 00:19:18.077
Huh?

304
00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:20.477
See, look at this map.

305
00:19:20.477 --> 00:19:25.077
As to the entrance of the stadium, there are entrance from number 1 to 24,

306
00:19:25.077 --> 00:19:29.377
but the numbers 17 and 22 are missing.

307
00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:33.277
Missing? Number of the entrance.

308
00:19:33.277 --> 00:19:35.377
Number 17 and...

309
00:19:35.377 --> 00:19:37.277
number 22.

310
00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:39.777
That's true.

311
00:19:39.777 --> 00:19:44.477
The reason there's no code number is probably because of this.

312
00:19:48.377 --> 00:19:49.977
Now that you mentioned it,

313
00:19:49.977 --> 00:19:52.277
I heard that they blocked off gate number 12 and 22

314
00:19:52.277 --> 00:19:55.677
to make some kind of facility.

315
00:19:55.677 --> 00:19:59.577
But which one is it? 17 or 22?

316
00:19:59.577 --> 00:20:01.877
Where do we look?

317
00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:15.477
We've no choice. Let's start from number 17.

318
00:20:15.477 --> 00:20:17.077
Wait!

319
00:20:17.077 --> 00:20:19.177
We don't seem to have that much time.

320
00:20:21.077 --> 00:20:22.877
Now for the grand finale.

321
00:20:22.877 --> 00:20:25.277
This is the bottom of the ninth inning with two out no runner!

322
00:20:25.277 --> 00:20:27.677
Ohgane High School leads by one point.

323
00:20:27.677 --> 00:20:30.577
The next batter is the one known for his three hits,

324
00:20:30.577 --> 00:20:32.577
three base hits and one homer.

325
00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:42.677
Number four, third, Nagashima.

326
00:20:46.677 --> 00:20:50.277
They're going to pick on the weak point and make him walk.

327
00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:52.977
He's the only one who's had hits, too.

328
00:20:52.977 --> 00:20:55.577
They don't want to risk him striking a hit

329
00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:57.777
and lose the game after all this.

330
00:21:01.577 --> 00:21:02.677
Strike!

331
00:21:09.277 --> 00:21:11.877
Right in the centre? Straight!

332
00:21:11.877 --> 00:21:14.777
Hey, hey. Is this the end of the game?

333
00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:18.577
Those two are just like Shinichi after all.

334
00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.677
Just like?

335
00:21:20.677 --> 00:21:22.877
Just like Shinichi back in junior high school

336
00:21:22.877 --> 00:21:25.377
during the soccer championship game.

337
00:21:25.377 --> 00:21:28.277
It was lost time with the other team leading by 1 point.

338
00:21:28.277 --> 00:21:31.177
With less than a minute to go, the other team scored another point,

339
00:21:31.177 --> 00:21:33.477
so it seemed to be over.

340
00:21:33.477 --> 00:21:36.277
Wanting to see what kind of look Shinichi was wearing

341
00:21:36.277 --> 00:21:38.177
when returning the ball to the centre.

342
00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:40.177
I looked through the opera glass.

343
00:21:41.977 --> 00:21:43.977
Then I saw him laughing.

344
00:21:45.477 --> 00:21:47.077
Laughing?

345
00:21:47.077 --> 00:21:51.077
Yes. I asked the other boys of the soccer club later

346
00:21:51.077 --> 00:21:54.377
and you know what he was saying while laughing?

347
00:21:54.377 --> 00:21:55.977
What? What?

348
00:21:57.377 --> 00:21:58.877
I tell you, that guy...

349
00:22:03.777 --> 00:22:09.477
Cool. If we win, we'll be legend.

350
00:22:09.477 --> 00:22:11.877
Awesome.

351
00:22:13.777 --> 00:22:16.477
And? How'd the game turn out?

352
00:22:16.477 --> 00:22:17.877
Right, right!

353
00:22:17.877 --> 00:22:20.277
They lost after all.

354
00:22:21.977 --> 00:22:25.277
Life's not that easy, you see!

355
00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:27.877
During the Penalty Kick.

356
00:22:27.877 --> 00:22:30.777
Which means...

357
00:22:30.777 --> 00:22:32.677
Right. With a minute left,

358
00:22:32.677 --> 00:22:34.177
and Shinichi's goal and assistance,

359
00:22:34.177 --> 00:22:38.377
they somehow made it to penalty kick.

360
00:22:38.377 --> 00:22:41.877
But in the end it was Shinichi who didn't make the penalty kick, too.

361
00:22:41.877 --> 00:22:47.877
But his rear view after that looked a bit cool.

362
00:22:55.777 --> 00:23:00.677
Just a bit now, just a bit.

363
00:23:00.677 --> 00:23:03.277
And Shinichi back then...

364
00:23:03.277 --> 00:23:07.077
Those two kind of resembled him.

365
00:23:07.077 --> 00:23:09.477
I mean, they refuse to give up.

366
00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:13.177
The childish character of not wanting to lose.

367
00:23:13.177 --> 00:23:14.977
I wonder if Heiji is that way, too.

368
00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:17.177
Yes. I'm sure he is.

369
00:23:21.177 --> 00:23:23.477
Strike two!

370
00:23:23.477 --> 00:23:26.377
He swung at air! Two nothing!

371
00:23:26.377 --> 00:23:29.277
Oh, no! They've been cornered!

372
00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:31.577
It's no good, we won't make it.

373
00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.077
Mr. Ohtaki,

374
00:23:33.077 --> 00:23:35.977
in baseball, you never can tell until the very last minute!

375
00:23:35.977 --> 00:23:38.277
If you have time thinking of something useless like that,

376
00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:40.577
hurry and think of the meaning of the code, will you?

377
00:23:40.577 --> 00:23:43.277
Right, but I mean really...

378
00:23:43.277 --> 00:23:47.277
Big slugger of Konan is cornered!

379
00:23:47.277 --> 00:23:49.977
Will he be able to pull the game out of the fire?

380
00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:51.477
Nagashima?

381
00:23:54.077 --> 00:23:56.177
Right! The missing number!

382
00:23:56.177 --> 00:23:57.177
What?

383
00:23:57.177 --> 00:23:59.177
There was no number in the parenthesis

384
00:23:59.177 --> 00:24:02.077
because it's a retired number!

385
00:24:02.077 --> 00:24:04.277
Retired number?

386
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:07.077
Between gates 21 and 23,

387
00:24:07.077 --> 00:24:11.377
there is a booth for a professional team whose home ground is Koshien!

388
00:24:11.377 --> 00:24:15.277
And there's a reference library where that retired number is displayed!

389
00:24:15.277 --> 00:24:16.577
But Heiji,

390
00:24:16.577 --> 00:24:19.177
isn't the area between 21 and 23 the place

391
00:24:19.177 --> 00:24:23.077
where we were to begin with, the right stand?

392
00:24:23.077 --> 00:24:25.077
Ran.

393
00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:40.377
Darn it!

394
00:24:40.377 --> 00:24:43.477
You mean she can't hear the phone because of the applause?

395
00:24:43.477 --> 00:24:45.377
Pitcher Inao!

396
00:24:45.377 --> 00:24:48.677
This is his 100th ball. There it goes!

397
00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:53.277
He hit the ball!

398
00:24:54.677 --> 00:24:56.377
Did it go up too high?

399
00:24:56.377 --> 00:24:58.077
You idiot!

400
00:24:58.077 --> 00:25:00.277
The centre spreads his arms out wide

401
00:25:00.277 --> 00:25:02.577
and is waiting for the ball to come his way.

402
00:25:02.577 --> 00:25:04.777
Konan High School, is it over for them?

403
00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:07.277
Don't catch, don't catch.

404
00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:09.077
Here goes, Hiroshi.

405
00:25:09.077 --> 00:25:11.077
Don't catch it! Don't catch it!

406
00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:13.077
I'm going over to where you are.

407
00:25:18.477 --> 00:25:21.477
Don't catch the ball! Don't catch it!
