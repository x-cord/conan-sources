1
00:00:01,778 --> 00:00:03,678
Emergency, emergency.

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:05,678
From MPD to all stations.

3
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:07,078
We haven't specified where yet,

4
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:09,978
but we received a bomb threat warning.

5
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:11,478
There are two bombs.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:16,378
Time of explosion is at noon tomorrow and at 15:00 the same day.

7
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:20,178
As the past incidents show, this warning is very credible.

8
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,078
Keep strict watch and be on the alert.

9
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:24,378
Continue investigation and don't let the suspect get away.

10
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,478
Extended game?

11
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,278
He's toying with us.

12
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:34,178
-Megure! -Yes, sir.

13
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:36,878
No extension is allowed.

14
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,178
Settle the case once and for all, understand?

15
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:41,678
I'll do my best, sir.

16
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:48,078
It's your chance to...

17
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:51,878
The memory that you harbor within you and cannot erase...

18
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:53,978
This is a chance to get rid of it.

19
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:56,878
Yes. I have to get rid of.

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,378
I've got to arrest the bomber and forget about the past.

21
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:01,778
Forget?

22
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:07,878
Keepsakes of your father who died on duty,

23
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:10,078
and you wear it as a charm.

24
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,378
Give it back to me!

25
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:15,878
I know what you want to say to me,

26
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:18,078
throw it away to go on forward, forget about it.

27
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,978
No. You don't have to forget.

28
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:22,478
What?

29
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,078
Whether you move on forward or not depends on you.

30
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,678
If you forget him completely, your father will be really gone.

31
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:33,178
Matsuda.

32
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:36,978
Matsuda.

33
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,578
Will you tell me something?

34
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:45,678
Why does this bomber hold a grudge against the police?

35
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:47,278
Conan!

36
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:49,178
When did you get in the car?

37
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:51,478
Tell me, please.

38
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:59,278
In the bombing incident of 7 years ago,

39
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,478
there were two bombers.

40
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:06,378
They planted the bombs in two separate condominiums.

41
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,478
They demanded a billion yen,

42
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:11,578
and said that they will blow the bomb up

43
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:13,778
if even one resident escapes from the condo.

44
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,478
We disposed of one bomb in time

45
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:20,678
but failed with the other.

46
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:24,578
We had to accept their demand.

47
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,378
They stopped the time counter

48
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:29,178
for triggering the bomb through their remote controller.

49
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,378
All the residents evacuated

50
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:33,878
and it seemed as if all was over.

51
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,978
But 30 minutes later, one of the bombers calls the police.

52
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:43,578
He said, "The timer is still counting down, what's going on?"

53
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:49,078
He probably made the mistake of watching the TV news

54
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:51,078
and reviewing what happened through VCR.

55
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:55,378
The police thought it a good chance to secure the bomber.

56
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:58,078
They talked him into conversation and succeeded in tracing his phone call.

57
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,678
We found the bomber in a telephone booth.

58
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,678
But unfortunately...

59
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:15,478
The bomber fled and was run over by a car and killed.

60
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:22,978
Then, how did you figure out there was the other bomber?

61
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,278
It's because...

62
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,578
Later, the timer that was supposed to stop counting

63
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:32,278
started counting again and the bomb blew up.

64
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,778
Run, everybody!

65
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,378
The timer started counting again!

66
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:49,778
We found the address of the bomber who was killed.

67
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:53,578
But all we found out was that he was living there with another guy.

68
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:57,578
The other bomber probably thought

69
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:01,378
the police gave false information through TV

70
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:03,878
and set a trap, which killed his pal.

71
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:10,178
They're blaming their faults on the wrong people.

72
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:12,078
It's their fault, because they set the bomb

73
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,978
and tried to get the money in the first place.

74
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,478
That's right.

75
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:19,578
You heard me, it's time to get off now.

76
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:22,078
We're going to help you.

77
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:25,578
The more the merrier.

78
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,678
Well, but if they find out

79
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:29,678
I'm making investigations with kids in my car...

80
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,778
Well, kids have more advantage

81
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:35,678
in solving this kind of childish codes.

82
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:39,278
Or, is it that you're not satisfied having just us

83
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,078
and Conan not around?

84
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:44,978
Not satisfied?

85
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,878
No, that's not it.

86
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:50,178
But, why did the bomber go out of his way

87
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:53,378
to send the coded note to the police?

88
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:56,078
If he didn't do anything, he wouldn't be caught.

89
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:59,278
Suppose you hide a treasure

90
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,978
and somebody comes trying to find it, what would you do?

91
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:05,178
I'll be watching him with my heart beating fast.

92
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:09,578
Suppose you hide the treasure in a pitfall with a trap?

93
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:11,678
Then of course, we will...

94
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,878
We'll give them clues little by little.

95
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,578
That's it! That's why he's started to give clues.

96
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:20,078
You're right. The bomber's acting like a child,

97
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:22,278
playing with a toy called the bomb.

98
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:23,978
He's a wicked brat with a wicked toy in his hands.

99
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:56,284
Hey, Ran! Telephone!

100
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:59,284
Gosh. Dad, answer the phone, will you?

101
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:02,984
Both my hands are full, so I can't pick up the phone.

102
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,684
Gosh.

103
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,384
Hello. This is Mouri.

104
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:11,084
It's me.

105
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:12,484
Dr. Agasa!

106
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:15,884
Ran, it's about Conan.

107
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:18,784
He insists on staying here tonight.

108
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:21,484
What? At your place, Dr. Agasa?

109
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,084
Yes. The kids really liked the game I made

110
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,584
and they just can't quit.

111
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:29,184
Are Ayumi and the others there, too?

112
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:30,784
That's right.

113
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,284
The Winter holidays will be over,

114
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:35,884
so they will be back by tomorrow evening.

115
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:36,884
But...

116
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:39,284
Well then, goodbye.

117
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,184
Ayumi's home next.

118
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,084
Please, Doc.

119
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:50,184
We want to get back at the bomber for what he did to Inspector Shiratori.

120
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:52,084
Right, right!

121
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:53,684
Please, Dr. Agasa.

122
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,884
I'll make sure to keep them out of danger, Doctor.

123
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,284
Gosh. I'll be in trouble if anyone finds out.

124
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:05,584
And I cooked Conan's favorite dish.

125
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,384
That's good, you know.

126
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:10,184
You're taking the national test tomorrow, aren't you?

127
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:11,484
You don't have to take care of the kids,

128
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:15,084
so you can prepare yourself for the test.

129
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:19,084
By the way, Ran, I'd like another bottle, please.

130
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,384
What? You are going to drink more?

131
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:24,384
It won't hurt, will it?

132
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:27,784
It's more of hassle taking care of a drunkard.

133
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,384
What does this note mean?

134
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:38,884
The only thing we're sure of is the time.

135
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:41,884
Anyway, the guy's a foreigner.

136
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:44,084
He's a major league baseball player.

137
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,084
Not exactly a foreigner.

138
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:49,584
There are Japanese major league players too now a days.

139
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,384
That's right.

140
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:56,184
But he set bomb to a baseball ground somewhere, I'm sure.

141
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:01,084
Yeah. It says "mound" and "Batter's box".

142
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,784
It's South Haido station.

143
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:04,784
You mean, South Haido station?

144
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,384
Of Toto Central Line?

145
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,484
That's right.

146
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,084
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:13,184
There's no baseball ground near South Haido Station.

148
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:14,984
It's a code.

149
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:19,584
It isn't literally referring to a mound or batter's box.

150
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,784
So, you mean you deciphered the code?

151
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,084
Yes.

152
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:27,684
Three years ago, bombs were set to

153
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:30,484
the Big Ferris Wheel of the Haido Shopping Mall

154
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:32,884
and the Beika Central Hospital.

155
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:35,784
South Haido Station of the Touto Chuo Line

156
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:40,784
is located where the roads facing the two places.

157
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:46,384
But that's just a play on words extended game and extended lines.

158
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:47,784
Slow, aren't you?

159
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:50,784
If a station is located where the roads intersect,

160
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:54,184
there would most naturally be a stopper there, right?

161
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,484
A stopper?

162
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:56,684
Stopper?

163
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,084
What's that?

164
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,084
I see! I got it!

165
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,084
What?

166
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,984
The crossing bar of a railroad crossing, isn't it?

167
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:08,284
Then, the steel batter's box could be...

168
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:11,584
Box of steel, or the car of the train.

169
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,784
And, to go climb the bloody mound,

170
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,184
could mean a red colored train that goes up to the center of the city.

171
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:21,184
Good heavens! I have to let Sato know about this.

172
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,884
It's all right. I heard you.

173
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:26,384
We virtually agree.

174
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:30,384
One bomb will be set up on the Toto Central Line train

175
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:33,784
that goes from South Haido Station to Tokyo.

176
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:37,384
I will contact the Inspector to dispatch investigators.

177
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:40,184
And Takagi, you arrange for the bomb disposal squad.

178
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:42,284
-Hurry! -Yes, right away.

179
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:45,384
What? South Haido Station?

180
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,784
Really?

181
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:50,984
Yes. And then?

182
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:53,484
Okay, I see.

183
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:54,784
We will arrange for it immediately.

184
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:02,784
Everybody, please evacuate calmly!

185
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,584
What? It's just trash.

186
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,484
What's this?

187
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,184
This... this is...

188
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,184
A bomb?

189
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:23,284
Get off, everybody. It's a bomb!

190
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:24,984
What?

191
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:33,484
What the heck is this?

192
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,784
What? False?

193
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,984
It wasn't a real bomb, you say?

194
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:40,084
And then?

195
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:41,784
I guess the bomber expected

196
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:45,384
the investigators go there to search.

197
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:50,284
Right. He is a smart-aleck mischievous brat, I guess.

198
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:54,684
-Besides, he's not after money. -Yes.

199
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:59,484
Yeah. The guy probably just has a grudge against the police,

200
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:05,584
and is holding hostage 12 million people who live in the city of Tokyo.

201
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:19,721
"Tohto Line, South Haido Station"

202
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,621
"Fail"

203
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:50,121
What? False bomb again?

204
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:52,521
Did you check all of them?

205
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:55,221
Is there no real bomb?

206
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:56,421
No, sir.

207
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:01,721
We have checked all the red trains that go through the city,

208
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,121
but all the suspicious ones have been false or pranks.

209
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,621
I see.

210
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:11,621
The bomber's probably trying to throw off our investigation.

211
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:14,421
Anyway, be patient and continue your investigations.

212
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:15,921
Yes, sir.

213
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,421
Director Matsumoto.

214
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:18,421
What is it?

215
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,821
Report from the Ozaki team, sir. They are at the ballparks.

216
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,021
-And, what did you get? -Yes, sir.

217
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:28,621
They have finished checking all the major ballparks in the city

218
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,021
but nothing came up so far.

219
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:36,121
They say they will continue investigation covering smaller ballparks.

220
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:41,321
We don't have to check the ballpark anymore, I guess.

221
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:45,521
All right. Stop all the red trains in the city.

222
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,621
Get all the investigators out of the ballparks

223
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,221
and dispatch them to all the stations to conduct investigations.

224
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,621
We still have five more hours

225
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,521
till the first explosion expected to go off at noon.

226
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:58,921
He can outfox us and try setting up a bomb from now.

227
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:00,221
Yes, sir!

228
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:09,021
Five more hours, huh?

229
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:14,421
I wanted to say we have only five hours left for us.

230
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,721
Yes.

231
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,121
I'm sleepy.

232
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,421
Isn't it strange?

233
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:37,821
From this note, you would think that

234
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:40,821
he expected somebody to come kooking for it to the ballpark,

235
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,421
but nothing happened.

236
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,121
He thought nobody would come.

237
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:50,521
It's off-season and no big game is scheduled.

238
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,021
Oh, yeah?

239
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,921
If he wanted to play pranks on the police,

240
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:58,721
he could have set a false trap or two.

241
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:02,721
At any rate, we can't keep those kids with us anymore.

242
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,521
You're right.

243
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:09,021
By the way, how is Shiratori? Did you ask how he is?

244
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:10,821
Yes, I did.

245
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:14,621
Yumi is taking care of Shiratori,

246
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,321
and she told me that the operation was successful.

247
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:19,721
They are waiting for him to regain consciousness.

248
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,421
That's good. I'm relieved.

249
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,321
Listen here, Takagi.

250
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,921
Make sure Miwako stays out of dangerous situations.

251
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,921
If the bomber is the same bomber

252
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:35,421
that killed Matsuda with a bomb,

253
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:37,721
who knows what she might do

254
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:41,521
and there will be no one but you who will be able to save her.

255
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:45,321
What? Why me?

256
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:50,121
You're so much like Mr. Matsuda.

257
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:54,121
But that's only because I happened to be disguised like him.

258
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:59,221
Of course, he's five to ten times better in looks or attitude.

259
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:01,521
Ten times, is it?

260
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,021
But something about you reminds me of him.

261
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:07,421
It may be your heart, feelings or whatever...

262
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:10,121
Something resembles Matsuda.

263
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:14,221
I guess Miwako came to realize that lately.

264
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:15,721
Hey, Takagi.

265
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:18,621
Takagi!

266
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,821
What were you thinking over so seriously?

267
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,021
Did you find out where the bomb is?

268
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,721
No, I didn't.

269
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:28,021
Then, what?

270
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:31,321
It's nothing important.

271
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:33,721
Okay, for now.

272
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,221
I'll continue the investigation.

273
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:44,421
You send the kids home.

274
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,521
Then you return to the MPD to get some sleep

275
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,121
and stay there to help Inspector Megure.

276
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,121
But I can keep investigating.

277
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:55,621
Don't be silly. An officer who is unsteady from lack of sleep

278
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,321
will only get in the way of the investigation. Got it?

279
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:01,621
Yes.

280
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,021
No.

281
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:10,021
I won't let you take him from me.

282
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:13,621
Not anymore.

283
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:14,921
Never.

284
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,521
Taking a test right after new year holidays

285
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,021
makes me feel like I'm living a gray life of a prep.

286
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,021
Yeah.

287
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,621
New year days are meant for everyone to enjoy!

288
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,721
So, you enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

289
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,821
Sure. I didn't want to regret not doing what I wanted to do.

290
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:41,421
Well, only thing I can depend on is this.

291
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:44,921
What? Isn't it... Could that be...

292
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,721
No.

293
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,721
Look!

294
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:54,021
Gosh. It's the photo of Kyogoku.

295
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,121
Yeah. This photo gives me energy when I look at it.

296
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:00,821
Even if my test results aren't good,

297
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,321
I won't get depressed.

298
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,821
As long as I have Makoto's love,

299
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:08,221
I don't need to score 100 on my test.

300
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:11,421
Oh, I'm so ashamed of myself for being so bold!

301
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,021
Sure, sure.

302
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,821
"I have stolen your sleeping face."

303
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,221
Okay, kids. I'll take you home.

304
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,921
Tell me where you live, will you?

305
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,021
What?

306
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:43,721
Are you taking us back home?

307
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:47,421
We may be able to solve this code in a moment.

308
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,921
You haven't slept for a long time.

309
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:55,421
I can't keep you, school kids, with me any longer.

310
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:56,421
What?

311
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,721
Say! Where's Officer Sato?

312
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:05,021
She's investigating on the case.

313
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:10,021
I see. Officer Sato told you to send us home.

314
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,621
You do everything she tells you to do, don't you?

315
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:17,621
I have to. She's two years older and my senior as well.

316
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,521
And you think you'll do fine after marrying her, too?

317
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,121
Marry her?

318
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:26,921
I won't be. Because she just dumped me the other day.

319
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,521
Sato.

320
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,121
Yes?

321
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:35,121
You said you have something to say to me.

322
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,221
Oh, that.

323
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,721
Sato.

324
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,721
Let's forget about the date. The date we were gonna have.

325
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:50,721
What?

326
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,721
I'm cursed.

327
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,221
Cursed?

328
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,421
All the people that I care dearly for,

329
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:01,321
seem to disappear from me.

330
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:05,921
My father, the P.E. teacher in school,

331
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:08,721
my senior in the baseball club,

332
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,121
and...

333
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,921
him too.

334
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:24,221
I don't want to have to go through that kind of pain anymore.

335
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,521
Sato.

336
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:29,021
We have been good friends and police officers,

337
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:31,221
and I want us to stay that way right through.

338
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:36,621
Sato.

339
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,821
Takagi.

340
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:45,021
Yes...

341
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:49,921
You're right. We are not well-matched in the first place.

342
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:54,921
Yeah, you deserve a prettier cuter girl.

343
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,521
Really?

344
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,021
See? I'm not getting married.

345
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:03,221
So you gave her up?

346
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:05,221
What a chicken!

347
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,021
No guts at all.

348
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,721
I don't want to give her up, but...

349
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:13,421
But what?

350
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,921
But...

351
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:21,421
Officer Matsuda risked his life to save the people in the hospital,

352
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,721
but I can't be his equal. Right?

353
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,021
Where did you learn that?

354
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,521
Officer Takagi. Ahead! Look ahead!

355
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:32,021
We heard about it from the lady on the mini-patrol car.

356
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,021
You mean Yumi?

357
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,921
She told us in detail.

358
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,121
Then, Officer Matsuda decided at that time

359
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:44,021
to risk his life to tell us where the other bomb was planted.

360
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,921
Yes, yes.

361
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:50,521
Well, time's up. I have to hang up now.

362
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,721
Wait, Matsuda!

363
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,421
Matsuda...

364
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:02,721
You can't listen to it or tell it without tears.

365
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,221
Yeah.

366
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:07,321
Oh, yeah?

367
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:10,221
I wouldn't blame you for giving up.

368
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:16,321
The memory of one who's gone is sealed

369
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:20,221
and will be kept in the heart for a life time.

370
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,821
Like someone I know.

371
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:25,221
Hey! I'm not dead yet.

372
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,521
How did you do on the math test?

373
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:41,121
Bummers.

374
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:47,321
Unlike you, I have nobody to help me in my difficulties.

375
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,621
Help me?

376
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:50,521
You can't fool me, Ran.

377
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:56,121
You were often looking at Shinichi's desk for the right answers.

378
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,921
"Help, Shinichi!

379
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:02,621
I have trouble solving this derivative, integral problem."

380
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,621
Be honest about it.

381
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:06,721
No, you're wrong! I looked at Shinichi's desk because...

382
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:08,821
Because? Keep on!

383
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:11,021
Because...

384
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:23,121
You're blushing crimson.

385
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:26,021
Red is a sinister color during test time.

386
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:27,021
Speaking of red,

387
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:30,521
there has been so many police sirens since this morning.

388
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,521
True. You're right.

389
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,821
What's happened?

390
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:44,521
Red, red...

391
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:46,121
What's the matter with red?

392
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:48,121
Something does not fit.

393
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:51,221
This "climb up the bloody mound" means.

394
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:54,021
You mean that it's not a red train?

395
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:57,921
It's kind of... not right.

396
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:02,021
Now, wait. If it's like the case 3 years before,

397
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:03,421
the first bomb is set in a place

398
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:07,721
that's rather easy for the police to find.

399
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,021
I have to think more simply.

400
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:12,421
The simpler the better.

401
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:16,421
Something that reminds you of red?

402
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,621
Mailboxes, fire engines...

403
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,021
Red demon, little red riding hood...

404
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:25,421
Tomato, strawberries, watermelon, apple,

405
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:29,321
cherries, hot chili pepper, red salmon and red lobsters...

406
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:34,321
Red... climb... steel... box...

407
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:37,021
Genta, you only think about food.

408
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:40,021
I've used up my brain, now I'm hungry.

409
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:42,721
I'm kinda thirsty.

410
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,021
Well, then we can go and stop at some parking area.

411
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:51,421
Red, you say. There's another red over there.

412
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:53,621
Look, you can see it over there.

413
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:55,221
Yeah.

414
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:01,421
I see.

415
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:05,021
Red, climb up, box of steel...
