1
00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.473
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:08.143
High school student Shinichi was
shrunken by a mysterious organization!

3
00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.493
If they found out that Shinichi
and Conan are the same person,

4
00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.393
everyone close to me would be in danger!

5
00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:14.023
I can't even tell Ran,
my childhood friend,

6
00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:16.563
or her detective father, Kogoro!

7
00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:18.323
There's only one truth again today!

8
00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:56.237
The Antique Collector Murder.

9
00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:00.977
There's no doubt about it.

10
00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:04.227
Your wife is cheating on you.

11
00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:05.067
I knew it!

12
00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:07.737
Have a look at the mole under her eye.

13
00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:12.577
This woman is none other
than your wife, Maru Ineko-san!

14
00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:19.627
It jumped again!

15
00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:23.567
How long is Kogoro
going to make us wait?

16
00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.967
He said he was going to
take us out to eat for once,

17
00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.297
but then he had to
stop by this place first...

18
00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:31.697
What detective in their right mind
would bring a kid along

19
00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:34.237
when informing someone
about their spouse's affair?

20
00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.637
A visitor?

21
00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:38.097
Who in blazes is this man?!

22
00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:40.567
I don't know that yet...

23
00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:43.447
A visitor?

24
00:02:43.447 --> 00:02:46.777
Hey! Get the door! Is anyone there?!

25
00:02:46.777 --> 00:02:47.907
Oh, that's right...

26
00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:53.867
I asked the housekeepers to waste time
outside since you were coming.

27
00:02:54.317 --> 00:02:57.487
Excuse me while I see
my visitor to the cottage.

28
00:02:57.487 --> 00:02:58.657
I will return soon!

29
00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:00.427
Certainly.

30
00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:11.857
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's go to the cottage.

31
00:03:26.657 --> 00:03:29.197
That's annoying!
What's that old man doing, anyway?!

32
00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:32.737
He probably can't hear it
because he's in the cottage!

33
00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:38.707
What the hell?!

34
00:03:47.237 --> 00:03:48.697
What is it?

35
00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:50.427
Did you hear anything strange just now?

36
00:03:50.857 --> 00:03:53.007
No, not really...

37
00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:00.977
Hey, isn't he taking kind of long?

38
00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:02.447
Yeah, he sure is...

39
00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:04.357
What could he be doing?

40
00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:09.357
Huh? They hung up?

41
00:04:09.777 --> 00:04:12.067
They hung up after one ring...

42
00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:16.607
Where in the world is he?!
It's been two hours now!

43
00:04:19.357 --> 00:04:22.247
Another single ring!
What's going on?

44
00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.747
I've had enough!
I'm going to the cottage!

45
00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:33.447
Man, am I hungry...

46
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:34.467
What the...?

47
00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:38.407
What is it?!

48
00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:41.407
Who are you people?!

49
00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:43.447
No, who are you?!

50
00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:45.737
We're the housekeepers here!

51
00:04:45.737 --> 00:04:48.527
What is all this ruckus?

52
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:49.527
Madam!

53
00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:51.487
Just what is happening here?

54
00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:54.817
I found this man snooping around
inside the house!

55
00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.737
A thief?!

56
00:04:57.027 --> 00:05:00.707
No! I'm a detective--
I was hired by this house's owner!

57
00:05:01.157 --> 00:05:02.207
A detective?!

58
00:05:03.697 --> 00:05:05.777
What business does
a detective have here?!

59
00:05:05.777 --> 00:05:07.917
You should ask your husband directly...

60
00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:09.487
Where is my husband?

61
00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:12.947
He went over to the cottage
and hasn't come back...

62
00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:15.427
Go bring my husband here.

63
00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:16.777
Yes, Madam!

64
00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:21.227
So how much did you find out?

65
00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:26.607
I'll pay you twice as much as he is!
Just keep my affair a secret!

66
00:05:26.607 --> 00:05:28.267
Um, Miss!

67
00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:36.267
What is it?!

68
00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:52.127
My husband!

69
00:05:52.447 --> 00:05:54.587
Ran! Call the police!

70
00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:56.487
Right!

71
00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:02.567
The victim is Maru Denjiro,
51 years old.

72
00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.857
This house's owner...

73
00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:07.487
Your husband practiced
Iai swordsmanship, is that right?

74
00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:10.657
Yes. He was a 3rd-degree master.

75
00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:12.987
He must have been
rather skilled, then...

76
00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:16.817
Was this really his sword?

77
00:06:16.817 --> 00:06:18.947
Yes. He kept it as
a decoration in the alcove.

78
00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.407
From the condition of this room,

79
00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:23.827
it appears he and the murderer
had quite the swordfight.

80
00:06:24.357 --> 00:06:27.937
Which means that the killer must
have been an expert swordsman as well.

81
00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:31.457
Is this the victim's organizer?

82
00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:35.417
It's filled with appointments...

83
00:06:36.197 --> 00:06:39.527
Conan-kun. You're certain
you saw the visitor, right?

84
00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:41.447
Yes. But just his legs.

85
00:06:41.447 --> 00:06:45.197
Let's see here. Today, he was to meet...

86
00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:49.857
Mori Kogoro, Suwa Yuji,
Hatano Ikuya, and Akutsu Makoto...

87
00:06:50.067 --> 00:06:51.857
These four people.

88
00:06:51.857 --> 00:06:54.357
Inspector! We found a suspicious man!

89
00:06:54.357 --> 00:06:55.397
What?!

90
00:06:55.777 --> 00:06:58.107
This man was prowling about
in front of the house!

91
00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:00.317
I'm not suspicious!

92
00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:02.407
Oh! Dr. Hatano!

93
00:07:02.407 --> 00:07:05.947
Hatano? This Hatano Ikuya-san?

94
00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:08.037
Yes! He's my husband's doctor!

95
00:07:08.357 --> 00:07:10.707
He gives him health checkups every week.

96
00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:11.567
His doctor, eh...

97
00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:15.547
Let go! Let go, I say!

98
00:07:15.547 --> 00:07:17.877
Do you have any idea who I am?!

99
00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:20.587
I'm Akutsu-sensei, the great engraver!

100
00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:24.067
Akutsu? Akutsu Makoto?

101
00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:27.907
So 3 of the 4 people
from his organizer are here.

102
00:07:27.907 --> 00:07:29.527
I've got it!

103
00:07:29.527 --> 00:07:32.857
The killer would be the person
who had already been here!

104
00:07:32.857 --> 00:07:35.227
And that person would be the last
one to show up: Suwa Yuji-san!

105
00:07:35.447 --> 00:07:37.437
What's this about me, now?

106
00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:42.827
I am Suwa. What exactly is
all the commotion here about?

107
00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:44.657
What's with this boy?

108
00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:46.037
You're getting in the way again?!

109
00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:49.247
You're a swordsman, aren't you, mister?

110
00:07:51.987 --> 00:07:54.357
How did you know that, my boy?

111
00:07:54.357 --> 00:07:55.937
Your left hand.

112
00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:56.707
My left hand?

113
00:07:56.707 --> 00:08:01.137
See that small scar between
your thumb and index finger?

114
00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:04.947
People who practice swordsmanship
often cut themselves there

115
00:08:04.947 --> 00:08:07.387
when sheathing their swords!

116
00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:10.947
So that's why I figured
you were into swords.

117
00:08:10.947 --> 00:08:12.447
Is he right?

118
00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:14.857
Yes, though I acquired this scar
when I was still inexperienced...

119
00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:17.067
So you really are the culprit, then!

120
00:08:17.407 --> 00:08:19.987
Culprit?! What are you talking about?

121
00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:24.737
H-How did this happen?!

122
00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.327
Are you implying that I did this?!

123
00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:30.237
It's obvious when you look at this place!

124
00:08:30.237 --> 00:08:32.067
The killer was clearly
a skilled swordsman!

125
00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:34.457
In other words, you!

126
00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:36.197
You've got it all wrong!

127
00:08:36.197 --> 00:08:39.857
I'm only here to pay back Maru-san
the 5 million yen he lent me!

128
00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:41.527
You're here to pay off a debt?

129
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:43.547
Here is the money, as you can see.

130
00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:47.817
The murder took place
between 3 and 5 o'clock.

131
00:08:47.817 --> 00:08:49.267
Where were you during that time?

132
00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:53.237
I believe I was
meditating alone at my dojo...

133
00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:55.227
Is there anyone who can verify this?

134
00:08:55.777 --> 00:08:57.437
N-No.

135
00:08:57.987 --> 00:08:59.657
Suspicious...

136
00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:01.667
Hey, that's not right!

137
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:02.317
Not right?

138
00:09:02.657 --> 00:09:05.447
The way he's holding his sword...
it's backwards!

139
00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:09.697
She's right! Look at that picture!

140
00:09:10.357 --> 00:09:12.407
The corpse's hands are
holding it the wrong way!

141
00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:16.627
So does that mean someone put
the sword in his hands afterwards?!

142
00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:20.527
Plus, regardless of how much
they may have fought,

143
00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:23.837
it's still unnatural for the walls
and ceiling to be cut this badly!

144
00:09:23.837 --> 00:09:28.487
Ah! So the killer tried
to frame Suwa-san

145
00:09:28.487 --> 00:09:31.307
by cutting up everything
in the room with a sword?

146
00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:32.987
But the killer made a mistake

147
00:09:32.987 --> 00:09:35.267
by messing up the
corpse's grip on the sword!

148
00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:37.527
Akutsu-san! What about you?

149
00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:41.947
I borrowed money from Maru-san too...
10 million yen...

150
00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:43.237
Did you come to pay him back?

151
00:09:43.737 --> 00:09:48.067
No, I needed more time,
so I came to ask for an extension...

152
00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:50.197
Where were you between 3:00 and 5:00?

153
00:09:50.197 --> 00:09:52.447
I was by myself at my studio.

154
00:09:52.447 --> 00:09:54.947
So you don't have an alibi, do you?

155
00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:57.567
What did you come here for?

156
00:09:57.567 --> 00:09:58.787
Who, me?

157
00:09:59.107 --> 00:10:03.467
Of course. The victim planned
to see you today, too.

158
00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:05.157
You can't be serious!

159
00:10:05.157 --> 00:10:08.797
I simply came to report about
something he hired me to look in to.

160
00:10:08.797 --> 00:10:10.847
To see if his wife was
cheating on him or not.

161
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.677
She was cheating on her husband?!

162
00:10:14.887 --> 00:10:19.607
Jeez! Detectives aren't supposed
to tell people about their cases!

163
00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:22.407
Where were you when
the murder took place?

164
00:10:22.407 --> 00:10:23.567
Let me think...

165
00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:24.487
Huh? This man smells different...

166
00:10:24.487 --> 00:10:27.237
I saw a movie in Ginza at 3:00...
Huh? This man smells different...

167
00:10:27.657 --> 00:10:29.987
I often see movies there...
It's a woman's perfume...

168
00:10:29.987 --> 00:10:32.907
Wait, I just smelled
this somewhere before...

169
00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:37.877
Stop that, Conan-kun!

170
00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:41.337
It's rude to sniff at people like that!

171
00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:43.567
I wasn't doing anything!

172
00:10:46.857 --> 00:10:47.677
It's her smell!

173
00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:51.137
Does that mean...

174
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.597
You smell just like the doctor does!

175
00:10:57.527 --> 00:10:59.897
He's right. It's the same perfume.

176
00:11:00.447 --> 00:11:03.607
Do you wear women's perfume?

177
00:11:03.607 --> 00:11:04.857
No...

178
00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:10.107
I know! Don't tell me you're the one
she's been seeing on the side?!

179
00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:10.817
It's true!

180
00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:13.987
I'll confess now that
there's no point in hiding it,

181
00:11:13.987 --> 00:11:16.827
but I've been secretly seeing Dr. Hatano!

182
00:11:16.827 --> 00:11:17.787
What?!
What?!

183
00:11:18.317 --> 00:11:20.317
But we're innocent!

184
00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:23.707
We were both at the Beika Hotel
from afternoon until evening!

185
00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:27.107
Are you sure the two of you didn't
arrange to say the same story?!

186
00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:28.177
What?!

187
00:11:28.737 --> 00:11:31.107
Whatever the case,
excluding old man Kogoro,

188
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:35.447
none of the three visitors have alibis!

189
00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:37.407
Who did it?!

190
00:11:52.197 --> 00:11:54.357
Hey! Not you again!

191
00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:56.567
This is Hatano. Are you there, Maru-san?

192
00:11:56.907 --> 00:12:01.067
Oh, well. Anyway, I'll be there
at 5:00, as we agreed.

193
00:12:02.447 --> 00:12:05.207
Call taken at 4:38.

194
00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:07.067
This is Suwa.

195
00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:11.627
I was planning to be there at 6:00,
but I think I may arrive early.

196
00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:15.857
I've made arrangements for
next month's level examinations.

197
00:12:15.857 --> 00:12:18.087
I'll give you the details
at a later time.

198
00:12:19.067 --> 00:12:22.007
Call taken at 4:41.

199
00:12:22.657 --> 00:12:25.737
I see. Dr. Hatano was scheduled for 5:00.

200
00:12:25.737 --> 00:12:30.317
Suwa-san was set for 6:00 but called
ahead and arrived at 5:00, correct?

201
00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:31.317
Yes.

202
00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:33.947
I left a message on
the answering machine too!

203
00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:34.737
Are you sure?

204
00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:35.987
I'm not lying!

205
00:12:35.987 --> 00:12:38.317
I said I was going to be a little late
but that I would pay him back!

206
00:12:38.697 --> 00:12:42.657
I also told him that I would
kill him if he sold it!

207
00:12:42.657 --> 00:12:44.037
You would kill him?!

208
00:12:44.567 --> 00:12:46.657
Well, yeah, he threatened me.

209
00:12:46.657 --> 00:12:51.067
He said he would sell the carving
I lent him if I didn't pay him back!

210
00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:52.497
What kind of carving?

211
00:12:53.447 --> 00:12:54.457
That dragon.

212
00:12:55.987 --> 00:12:58.197
There's something strange
about that carving!

213
00:12:59.407 --> 00:13:02.567
That's great! You weren't
damaged one bit!

214
00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:04.807
Good for you, mister! You're so lucky!

215
00:13:05.857 --> 00:13:08.767
It's a miracle that your carving was
the only thing unharmed in this room!

216
00:13:10.197 --> 00:13:13.657
Aha, I've got it figured out now...

217
00:13:13.657 --> 00:13:16.067
Akutsu-san. You are the killer!

218
00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:17.607
What?!

219
00:13:17.607 --> 00:13:21.737
You killed Maru-san and tried
to put the blame on Suwa-san.

220
00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:23.527
But you made a couple mistakes.

221
00:13:24.447 --> 00:13:27.747
First, you made the corpse
hold the sword the wrong way.

222
00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:31.707
Second, you couldn't
damage the dragon carving.

223
00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:33.987
It looks like you
didn't mind killing someone,

224
00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:37.947
but couldn't bear to bring harm
to your precious carving!

225
00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:39.127
This is just a coincidence!

226
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:43.197
Then why did you lie about leaving
a message on his answering machine?!

227
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:45.467
I didn't lie! I really
did leave a message!

228
00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:48.447
Come to think of it,
the phone rang three times!

229
00:13:48.447 --> 00:13:51.277
The 2nd and 3rd times,
it stopped ringing right away,

230
00:13:51.277 --> 00:13:52.307
but the first time...

231
00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:53.887
...it kept ringing over and over!

232
00:13:56.067 --> 00:13:59.947
Say, mister! Did anything
seem strange when you called?

233
00:13:59.947 --> 00:14:01.777
Like maybe nobody would pick up,
or something?

234
00:14:02.197 --> 00:14:05.237
Now that you mention it,
I left it ringing for a long time.

235
00:14:05.237 --> 00:14:07.697
Just when I thought I finally got through,
I got his answering machine.

236
00:14:07.697 --> 00:14:13.667
Our answering machine is set
to take messages after 10 rings.

237
00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:15.987
See? What did I tell you?

238
00:14:15.987 --> 00:14:19.107
What time did you call?

239
00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:21.877
It was shortly before our appointment,
so it was before 4:00.

240
00:14:23.407 --> 00:14:28.317
You probably heard the phone ringing
when you were killing Maru-san!

241
00:14:28.317 --> 00:14:30.097
So that's why you're
giving us this nonsense!

242
00:14:30.407 --> 00:14:32.397
No! I really did leave a message!

243
00:14:32.777 --> 00:14:34.107
How odd!

244
00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.527
If he was the murderer,

245
00:14:35.527 --> 00:14:37.857
then why would he concoct a lie that
people would see through right away?

246
00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:41.777
But there's no message from him
on the answering machine...

247
00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:43.527
Wait a second!

248
00:14:43.527 --> 00:14:47.317
Now that I think about it, there is
someone who left a strange message!

249
00:14:47.317 --> 00:14:49.527
One that nobody would normally leave...

250
00:14:49.527 --> 00:14:51.787
If so, then the killer is...

251
00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:55.077
Miss. Is there anything of value in here?

252
00:14:55.407 --> 00:14:58.377
Yes, there's a safe key
in one of the drawers!

253
00:15:01.197 --> 00:15:04.047
It's gone! The safe key is gone!

254
00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:05.357
What?!

255
00:15:05.357 --> 00:15:06.757
So it was you!

256
00:15:07.737 --> 00:15:09.567
Huh?

257
00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:11.977
Here it is. In a different drawer.

258
00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.187
Miss...

259
00:15:14.737 --> 00:15:18.727
But that's strange! My husband
always kept it in this one!

260
00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:23.857
These drawers!

261
00:15:24.317 --> 00:15:26.817
None of the large
sword cuts are connected!

262
00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:30.777
Say, is there an instant camera
in the house anywhere?

263
00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:32.157
Yes...

264
00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:34.827
That inspector says
he'd like to borrow it.

265
00:15:35.407 --> 00:15:37.047
Okay, I'll go get it!

266
00:15:47.987 --> 00:15:50.767
What part of "get out of here"
don't you understand?!

267
00:15:51.607 --> 00:15:53.137
Darn it!

268
00:15:53.137 --> 00:15:56.227
Oh well. At least I got my picture.

269
00:15:57.407 --> 00:15:59.187
Here it is!

270
00:15:59.657 --> 00:16:00.977
All I do now is...

271
00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:08.617
...cut out the drawers with
sword cuts that don't connect...

272
00:16:22.777 --> 00:16:25.777
Aha! So I was right!

273
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.257
I've solved this mystery!

274
00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:30.317
At any rate, I'll have to
take you down to the station.

275
00:16:30.317 --> 00:16:31.097
What?!

276
00:16:31.527 --> 00:16:33.807
Come now, there's no use in denying it!

277
00:16:33.807 --> 00:16:36.477
Shut up! I didn't do it!

278
00:16:39.987 --> 00:16:42.857
What's he doing?

279
00:16:42.857 --> 00:16:44.357
Well, let's go.

280
00:16:44.657 --> 00:16:46.317
Not so fast.

281
00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:48.027
Mori-kun...

282
00:16:48.027 --> 00:16:51.237
I've figured it out
for sure this time, Inspector.

283
00:16:51.237 --> 00:16:53.157
Figured out who did it, that is.

284
00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:55.037
Who?!

285
00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:56.707
The murderer is...

286
00:16:57.987 --> 00:17:00.167
...you, Suwa-san!

287
00:17:01.197 --> 00:17:04.067
Hey now, Suwa-san
practices swordsmanship--

288
00:17:04.067 --> 00:17:06.127
he wouldn't have made the corpse
hold the sword incorrectly...

289
00:17:06.127 --> 00:17:09.857
That's why we were so easily fooled...

290
00:17:09.857 --> 00:17:12.097
...which is exactly
what Suwa-san wanted!

291
00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.307
What?

292
00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:17.067
To make himself look suspicious,
he put sword cuts all over the room

293
00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:19.197
and then put the sword
in the victim's hands.

294
00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:21.567
But he provided himself
with an escape route

295
00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:23.767
by making the victim
hold the sword incorrectly.

296
00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:28.737
By doing this, he made it look
like someone had tried to frame him,

297
00:17:28.987 --> 00:17:32.447
and thus he was able to remove
himself of any suspicion.

298
00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:34.777
Mori-san.

299
00:17:34.777 --> 00:17:38.407
Do you really intend to accuse me
of this with nothing but conjecture?

300
00:17:38.407 --> 00:17:40.487
He has a point, Mori-kun!

301
00:17:40.487 --> 00:17:43.447
And besides, how do you
explain the dragon carving?!

302
00:17:43.447 --> 00:17:46.377
You were the one who just accused
Akutsu-san of being the murderer!

303
00:17:47.987 --> 00:17:49.857
I... was lying...

304
00:17:49.857 --> 00:17:50.887
Lying?!

305
00:17:52.857 --> 00:17:55.857
Suwa-san purposely left it unharmed

306
00:17:55.857 --> 00:17:57.597
in order to make
Akutsu-san look suspicious!

307
00:17:57.597 --> 00:18:00.777
Nonsense. This is
the first time we've met.

308
00:18:00.777 --> 00:18:04.527
How would I have known
the dragon belonged to him?

309
00:18:04.527 --> 00:18:06.817
The answering machine.

310
00:18:07.107 --> 00:18:10.407
The phone call that
Akutsu-san swore he made...

311
00:18:10.407 --> 00:18:13.277
My guess is that you heard it
while committing the murder.

312
00:18:13.777 --> 00:18:18.287
If you sell the dragon carving
I left with you, I swear I'll kill you!

313
00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:22.707
So you probably came up with a plan
on the spot to frame Akutsu-san.

314
00:18:22.707 --> 00:18:26.567
But Akutsu-san's message
wasn't on the tape!

315
00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:28.527
That's because Suwa-san
rewound the tape

316
00:18:28.527 --> 00:18:31.427
and recorded his own message
over the first one!

317
00:18:31.907 --> 00:18:34.987
But Dr. Hatano could
have done that too.

318
00:18:34.987 --> 00:18:36.007
No...

319
00:18:36.447 --> 00:18:41.307
In your message, you confessed that you,
yourself, were the murderer!

320
00:18:41.307 --> 00:18:42.347
What?!

321
00:18:42.657 --> 00:18:46.987
You left a message that you would
arrive earlier than planned.

322
00:18:46.987 --> 00:18:48.737
Don't you find that strange?

323
00:18:48.737 --> 00:18:52.357
Going early to someone's house
even though you know they're not home?

324
00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:56.947
You said that because you knew that
Maru-san was here, in the cottage,

325
00:18:56.947 --> 00:18:58.537
as a corpse!

326
00:19:00.987 --> 00:19:05.777
Maru-san said he was meeting
someone between 4:00 and 5:00,

327
00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:08.087
so he asked me to come at
any time other than that.

328
00:19:08.607 --> 00:19:12.297
So I figured that coming before our
appointed 6:00 was fine with him.

329
00:19:12.297 --> 00:19:15.757
Do you still suspect me now?

330
00:19:16.407 --> 00:19:19.137
I don't suspect you of killing him.

331
00:19:19.137 --> 00:19:22.887
I am certain of it!

332
00:19:22.887 --> 00:19:24.097
What?!

333
00:19:24.097 --> 00:19:29.237
There is definitive proof in
this room that you are the murderer!

334
00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:31.067
W-Where?!

335
00:19:31.067 --> 00:19:36.777
The real reason for cutting up
the room was to conceal something!

336
00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:38.817
To conceal something?

337
00:19:38.817 --> 00:19:40.517
The marks on the drawers.

338
00:19:42.157 --> 00:19:44.487
Take a close look at the cut marks.

339
00:19:44.487 --> 00:19:46.657
Some of them aren't connected.

340
00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:48.087
You're right!

341
00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:51.947
The drawers were switched
around purposely by the killer.

342
00:19:51.947 --> 00:19:53.657
To put them back as they were,

343
00:19:53.657 --> 00:19:57.067
take the drawer on the top row,
2nd from the left,

344
00:19:57.067 --> 00:20:00.737
and switch it with the rightmost
drawer of the same row.

345
00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:08.317
Next, take the leftmost drawer
of the next row down

346
00:20:08.317 --> 00:20:10.197
and switch it with the
leftmost drawer of the 5th row.

347
00:20:10.197 --> 00:20:13.817
The 2nd row, 2nd column and the
rightmost drawer of the same row.

348
00:20:13.817 --> 00:20:16.777
3rd row, 2nd column and the
rightmost drawer of the 4th row.

349
00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:22.787
Finally, 5th row, 2nd column and
the 4th row, 3rd column from the left.

350
00:20:24.067 --> 00:20:26.117
W-What is this?!

351
00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:27.827
"Suwa"?!

352
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:32.857
My guess is that while Suwa-san was
busy erasing Akutsu-san's message,

353
00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:35.567
the victim wrote this with his sword.

354
00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.837
Having realized this,
you switched the drawers around

355
00:20:38.317 --> 00:20:42.487
and put your own cut marks on them
to make the letters illegible.

356
00:20:42.487 --> 00:20:46.407
But the drawers would stand out
as the only things damaged,

357
00:20:46.407 --> 00:20:49.357
so you cut up everything else
in the room too.

358
00:20:49.357 --> 00:20:52.357
All to conceal the
victim's dying message to us,

359
00:20:52.357 --> 00:20:53.977
which he had written on the drawers!

360
00:20:53.977 --> 00:20:58.197
But why? You had the money
to pay off your debt!

361
00:20:58.197 --> 00:20:59.907
Because of a sword.

362
00:21:00.317 --> 00:21:03.687
A sword? The one the victim was holding?

363
00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:07.457
No, not that dull excuse for a sword.

364
00:21:07.737 --> 00:21:09.817
The sword that I left
with him as collateral...

365
00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:12.237
The family sword that has been
passed down for generations...

366
00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.567
...the Kikuchiyo.

367
00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:15.757
He had the nerve to...

368
00:21:17.107 --> 00:21:20.927
Oh, that sword? I sold it.

369
00:21:22.027 --> 00:21:23.637
It didn't go for very much, though.

370
00:21:24.697 --> 00:21:30.437
Let's consider the money I received
for it as the interest on your loan.

371
00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:34.937
Before I knew it, I had struck
him down with the sword.

372
00:21:35.407 --> 00:21:38.697
Yes. Just like this!

373
00:21:51.607 --> 00:21:55.107
The rest happened just as you said.

374
00:21:55.107 --> 00:21:58.257
Even so, the fact that you didn't
even flinch when I attacked...

375
00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:01.467
You are indeed an extraordinary detective,
Mori Kogoro-dono.

376
00:22:01.947 --> 00:22:05.317
It would seem that my greatest mistake

377
00:22:05.317 --> 00:22:08.687
was not realizing that you were here.

378
00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:44.897
That was amazing, Dad!

379
00:23:44.897 --> 00:23:47.017
I've changed my opinion of you again!

380
00:23:50.057 --> 00:23:53.267
Oh? There's something on your head...

381
00:23:59.607 --> 00:24:04.607
Blood! It's blood! I'm bleeding!

382
00:24:04.607 --> 00:24:09.767
Incidentally, the old man's injury
turned out to be a 3-millimeter scratch.

383
00:24:12.807 --> 00:24:15.297
Conan and the others are
at the department store.

384
00:24:16.507 --> 00:24:18.047
It's a gang of thieves!

385
00:24:18.047 --> 00:24:20.217
Genta-kun isn't back yet...

386
00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:24.107
Make me some food already!

387
00:24:24.107 --> 00:24:25.807
Is this the investigation section?

388
00:24:25.807 --> 00:24:27.877
Could you get Inspector Megure?

389
00:24:30.187 --> 00:24:31.317
We're surrounded!

390
00:24:32.227 --> 00:24:34.557
A thief gang in the department store?

391
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.277
Don't tell me that those kids are...

392
00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:38.767
On the next Conan--

393
00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:40.737
The Department Store Hijack.

394
00:24:58.179 --> 00:24:59.997
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:59.997 --> 00:25:00.001
Next Conan's Hint:
Elevator girl.

396
00:25:00.001 --> 00:25:02.314
Elevator girl.
