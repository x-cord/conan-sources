1
00:00:03,512 --> 00:00:04,613
"Blue, White and Black. Each person's reasoning" -Well, the thing

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:06,615
"Blue, White and Black. Each person's reasoning" -that bugs me most is...

3
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:10,886
that the killer deliberately made Tokitsu sit on the desk.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,688
This position.

5
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,990
Is there any meaning to it?

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,992
One of the reasons may be that

7
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:20,296
the killer simply wanted the locked room murder to be visible from outside.

8
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:22,498
However...

9
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:26,102
And I wonder about the lavender and toolbox.

10
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:29,004
There seems to be both of them everyone else's room too.

11
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:34,810
No use staring from outside.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,512
-I'm opening it. -Wait.

13
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:39,815
-Let me. -Go ahead!

14
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:47,389
Wires, nails, a wrench, a screw driver,

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:49,892
a drill, a steel ruler, a plier,

16
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,594
glue for wood products,

17
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,696
a saw, a utility knife.

18
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:56,098
Just as I thought, there's no hammer inside.

19
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,101
It seems that the murder weapon was taken out of here

20
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,703
After all, with a hammer like that,

21
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:03,205
a man, a woman

22
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:06,008
or even an elderly person could commit the murder.

23
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,110
Time wise that's true.

24
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,313
The time that those three disappeared from our sight

25
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:15,217
was from 19:26 and 32 seconds

26
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,686
to 19:39 and 15 seconds, to go to the restroom.

27
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:20,089
Mr. Tsuchio, who went to his room to get his cigarettes

28
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:25,094
was gone from 20:06 and 47 seconds to 21:28 and 21 seconds.

29
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,297
And finally Mr. Koya, who came to check on Mr. Tokitsu came to this room

30
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:33,302
and was gone from 21:30 and 6 seconds to 21:38 and 52 seconds.

31
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,806
Any of the three had enough time to commit the murder.

32
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,507
He even had the seconds recorded.

33
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:42,511
But, Mr. Koya seems to have been in the kitchen most of the time.

34
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,913
So, he would've been able to hide and move around freely

35
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:46,015
without having to worry about us watching him.

36
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,917
Well, but the kitchen windows

37
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,986
are all ones that cannot be opened or closed,

38
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,289
and are only there to let the light in.

39
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,291
As for the kitchen door it's here,

40
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,792
that is, in order to go out,

41
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,895
he'll have to pass the dining room, where we are,

42
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:02,698
so I'm sure Mr. Koya was in the kitchen all the while.

43
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:04,600
By the way, this is the blueprint of the second floor

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,204
and all the four rooms are very similar except for a light difference

45
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,905
in the direction the windows are facing.

46
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:13,209
You sure work fast.

47
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,112
I've been here a half day earlier than you all, you see.

48
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:18,814
Come to think of it,

49
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:21,217
why is there electricity here?

50
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:22,718
Right...

51
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,286
it's an uninhabited island and yet.

52
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:27,590
A simple generator seems to be in the shed.

53
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,792
Would you like to go take a look?

54
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:30,993
We could go check out the wireless radio

55
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:33,295
that's supposed to be there while we're at it too.

56
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:45,007
True.

57
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,510
Talk about destroyed...

58
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:54,016
So this is the generator,

59
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,185
wasn't there a lock to this place?

60
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:59,188
There should've been a padlock.

61
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:02,291
I'm sure that Mr. Koya had the lock.

62
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,298
The padlock's

63
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,600
been forced opened!

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,403
Talk about a lot of muddy shoe prints...

65
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,005
It's Mr. Tsuchio's,

66
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,508
since he's the only one who came outside after it started raining.

67
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:22,611
Isn't that right, Hakuba?

68
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,313
Huh? He's gone.

69
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:27,316
What's with him? He disappeared.

70
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:29,318
It's gone.

71
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,986
It's not here.

72
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:36,091
The wire from the toolbox in this person's room is gone after all.

73
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,695
Isn't Hakuba back?

74
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:43,699
No, wasn't he together with you?

75
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,703
By the way, did you find anything after checking the shed?

76
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:49,405
Well, sort of.

77
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,507
No way.

78
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,311
The man's drunk.

79
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:58,414
You guys all claim that you're detectives

80
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,716
but you're all no more than green horns

81
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:03,185
that look capable on the outside.

82
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,591
Then, let's have them listen

83
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:12,294
to the deduction of the green-horn, shall we?

84
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,799
I see.

85
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,101
So, that's the story.

86
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:23,005
No doubt about it,

87
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,106
the culprit is...

88
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:25,307
that person.

89
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,409
That man.

90
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,410
Right?

91
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,414
He killed Tokitsu and prepared the locked room.

92
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:37,786
Mr. Renzo Koya.

93
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,694
Well, it's really simple with a little bit of thinking.

94
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:47,896
Tokitsu said it would take about an hour

95
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:50,799
to rig his room into a locked room.

96
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:54,703
In other words, it was a trick that was that intricate.

97
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:56,505
You naturally went to check him out

98
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,209
just about when the room would be ready and killed him.

99
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,711
It could be carried out very naturally if you used his room

100
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,714
that was prepared for the locked room murder.

101
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:08,317
So, it wouldn't have been possible for Koshimizu who went to the restroom

102
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:11,787
right after Tokitsu said so and left.

103
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,490
Nor for Mr. Tsuchio who left 30 minutes later

104
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,492
to his room to get his cigarette

105
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:17,893
to commit the murder.

106
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:21,096
In other words, you, Mr. Renzo Koya, who went to see him alone

107
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,999
just before he was found killed in the locked room

108
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,602
is the only one

109
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,203
who could've killed him.

110
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,906
Oh, boy...

111
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:34,309
How much do you have to disappoint me before you stop?

112
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:37,813
I'm sorry to say that he's not the one.

113
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,615
Because the one who committed the crime

114
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:43,485
is one who can unlock and lock doors and windows just by using a wire.

115
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,488
That person is Mr. Tsuchio.

116
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,190
It's you.

117
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,192
Don't be ridiculous!

118
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,895
The padlock that was on the shed that you headed for

119
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,098
after lying that you were going to go get your cigarette.

120
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:59,001
New traces of it having been forced opened were seen,

121
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,904
moreover, it found wet and thrown into the shed.

122
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:05,307
In other words, the one who forced the door open was Mr. Tsuchio,

123
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:07,509
the only one who went outside after it began raining.

124
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,812
On top of that, only the wire was found missing

125
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,614
from the toolbox in your room.

126
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:14,917
How did he make the locked room, though?

127
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,585
Mr. Tsuchio mentioned that

128
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,388
he came here three days ago to check the place out beforehand.

129
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,089
At that time he probably,

130
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,593
opened a small hole in the window of that room.

131
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,296
Then, after killing Mr. Tokitsu tonight,

132
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,897
he went outside from the window,

133
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,599
and from the hole in the glass he made previously,

134
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,602
used the wire to lock the window,

135
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:39,408
He probably figured beforehand that Hattori

136
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:41,110
would break through the window glass later

137
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,511
and make a grand entrance into the room,

138
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:47,015
making it impossible to find the hole made in the glass.

139
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:50,185
He then went to destroy the wireless radio in the shed,

140
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:53,489
to breed anxiety in us and corner us mentally.

141
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:56,291
He was ready to kill another one of us after that!

142
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,693
Isn't that right?

143
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:58,994
No way!

144
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:00,896
I don't think so.

145
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,201
Even if he were able to predict that

146
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,704
Heiji would break through the glass window,

147
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:10,706
he wouldn't have been able to tell

148
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:12,608
which of the four windows he would break through!

149
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:16,011
Besides, although Heiji is hot tempered,

150
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,313
I'm sure he would've noticed if there was a hole.

151
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,616
Never mind the hot tempered.

152
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:23,085
But the one who forced opened the padlock of the shed

153
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:24,686
is unmistakably him.

154
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:28,190
Yeah, it's true that this man has a bad habit,

155
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,391
but that's about it.

156
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:33,195
Or, is it that you have an equation in your head

157
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:36,598
that says, "A thief is the killer?"

158
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,302
I guess I goofed.

159
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:43,305
So, what with the locked room, trick?

160
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,908
Yep, it's a super simple trick!

161
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:48,911
First, you remove all the screws holding the window frames in place.

162
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,612
Then, you remove the windows.

163
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:54,616
Finally, cut all the screws short using pliers and all set!

164
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:56,585
Then you insert the head of the screw that had been cut off

165
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:57,786
back into the window frame,

166
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:00,188
and put glue on the area around the window frame.

167
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,692
Then, you go outside and fix the entire window in place.

168
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,495
In other words, it looks like the window is fixed on with screws,

169
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:08,497
but the inside is not.

170
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:13,001
The window was just glued on.

171
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,704
-And, the one who could've done that is... -Hold it.

172
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,107
Right, the very last person who went to Mr. Tokitsu's room...

173
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,209
Mr. Koya.

174
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,611
No one other than you could've done it!

175
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,414
What're you talking about, Heiji? He's...

176
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:27,416
You caught Tokitsu who was taking

177
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,818
his good old time absorbed in the trick off guard,

178
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:32,187
hit him and killed him.

179
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:35,090
No, I hate to interrupt you but...

180
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,692
Mr. Koya couldn't have carried the trick out.

181
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,594
I've got proof too.

182
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:42,598
This screw with the head cut off that I found in Tokitsu's room!

183
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,499
This guy...

184
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,201
Don't tell me that...

185
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,079
"Green. Message from Heiji" -Well?

186
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,280
"Green. Message from Heiji" -This is what you call

187
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,982
"Green. Message from Heiji" -conclusive evidence!

188
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:04,286
I guess you couldn't retrieve all of them.

189
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:09,958
Right!

190
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,261
You never know where the screw would fly off to

191
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,363
if you cut them with pliers.

192
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,568
Just as I thought.

193
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,870
So, it was you

194
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,273
who killed Tokitsu after all.

195
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,380
Hattori.

196
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,883
Tokitsu said that it would take him an hour to prepare the trick,

197
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,186
because he included the time for the glue to dry.

198
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:40,055
No matter how quickly he removed the screws and cut them,

199
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:45,160
even for instant glue to dry, it would take over 30 minutes.

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,262
In other words, Tokitsu had planned to finish

201
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,465
what he had to in less than 30 minutes

202
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,167
and wait outside for the glue to dry.

203
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:56,471
So, the person who could kill Tokitsu who was still in his room

204
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,373
is the one who got up right after dinner started.

205
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:00,876
You're the only one who could've done it!

206
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,278
You probably faked going to the restroom

207
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:04,980
and headed for Tokitsu's room.

208
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,582
You probably told him that you also figured out the trick

209
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:10,085
so you wanted to compare answers and went inside.

210
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:13,155
You caught him off guard and killed him.

211
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,357
Then, you completed the trick that he was working on

212
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,359
and created the locked room.

213
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,861
You then entered from the front door

214
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,163
and came back to the dining room where we were,

215
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,765
as if nothing happened. That's it!

216
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:28,170
But, this is based on the assumption that you could've done it.

217
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,872
There's no proof.

218
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:34,576
That's why I used the screw of the wireless radio that was in the shed.

219
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,878
Even if you know that you picked all the screws up,

220
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:41,283
me showing you this would make you anxious, right?

221
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:44,786
Moreover, Mr. Koya is suspected, and once you think it's not yourself,

222
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,755
you inevitably go off guard.

223
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:48,857
I figured you would look towards the place you hid the screws,

224
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,059
so I kept watching you,

225
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,563
but I didn't think you keep them on you, in your pocket.

226
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:57,065
It surprised me...

227
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,169
seeing you counting them.

228
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:06,074
Well, you pretended to be afraid of the thunder and picked one up,

229
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:09,378
so I figured you had one on you.

230
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,980
You knew we were checking the shed.

231
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,582
You weren't afraid of thunder,

232
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:16,785
but rather, it's proof that you were watching outside.

233
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:19,354
You bent down then to pick up the screw

234
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:22,557
that you failed to pick up previously, right?

235
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,062
Am I wrong?

236
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,464
Oh, that's probably...

237
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:34,770
To hide the hole for your pierced ear.

238
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,872
You covered your ears to hide it, right?

239
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,473
Huh, pierce...

240
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:39,875
But...

241
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,477
That's why you were wearing a headphone on the ship, right?

242
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,879
Because if your hair blew in the sea breeze,

243
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,480
it would reveal your pierced ears.

244
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,284
Well, there are a lot of students with pierced ears in England,

245
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:51,186
so I didn't even bother to notice.

246
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,655
But, I thought your high school was really strict

247
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,558
that you could never be allowed pierced ears.

248
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,760
Yes, but it's okay already.

249
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,362
I'm already 20,

250
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:03,165
and I've graduated high school two years ago.

251
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:07,169
I took my old uniform out to hide what I could,

252
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,870
but goofed.

253
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,772
I even went as far as to talk about school rules

254
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,275
so that I would look like a high school girl.

255
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,878
But, why did you gather us high school detectives

256
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:19,081
and do something like this?

257
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,386
I wanted to find out about something.

258
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,954
And, what's that?

259
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,658
The homicide at Lavender Manor.

260
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:32,160
You wanted to know who the high school detective that solved it was, right?

261
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,462
Yes.

262
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:37,966
Then, you mean it was... Tokitsu?

263
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:42,471
Although the name and details of the case wasn't written in the papers.

264
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,774
Yes, he happened to drop by at the mansion

265
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,876
while traveling through Shikoku,

266
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:52,180
solved the locked room case and left without saying his name.

267
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,281
Because of him,

268
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:57,185
my best friend who was working as a housekeeper there was suspected.

269
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,286
She was suspected on the grounds

270
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:02,557
that she was with the lady of the house, just two of them together.

271
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:07,162
I also went to that mansion as a detective,

272
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,065
a month before that man appeared.

273
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:13,068
My best friend asked me to investigate the case

274
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:15,370
because it could be a homicide.

275
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:25,580
But, I couldn't come up with anything.

276
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,083
I couldn't think of anything other than the fact that

277
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,853
she had locked herself in her room and committed suicide.

278
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:36,258
Then, why was your best friend suspected?

279
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:39,861
The high school detective that came two months later

280
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,764
found outside the window of her room

281
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:45,067
scattered screws with heads cut off

282
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:50,772
as well as the fact that the window was only pasted on with glue.

283
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:53,075
You mean you overlooked it?

284
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,876
Overlooked it my foot.

285
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,478
The man called Tsuchio

286
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:58,680
disguised himself as a cleaning staff

287
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,982
and set up the trick.

288
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:04,586
He probably rigged the window so that it would come off easily,

289
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:08,056
when he planned to come back to rob the house later.

290
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,259
That's why when you heard of the Lavender Manor,

291
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:15,263
you went pale and wanted to escape from the island.

292
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:17,365
Six months after the incident,

293
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,668
Tokitsu jumps onto the trick,

294
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,770
as if to boast his power of deduction,

295
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,373
reports to the police and the media that this is a homicide.

296
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:26,675
"New Truth Disclosed on Suicide of the Lady of Lavender Manor"

297
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:28,176
"Police Conclude it to be Locked Room Homicide!"

298
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:29,578
"Suspect Still Denies Charges"

299
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,481
If the rust of the screws were checked,

300
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,682
it would've been obvious whether it had anything

301
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,684
to do with the case or not.

302
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:38,386
Tokitsu, realized that something was not right,

303
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:40,756
so he didn't disclose his name.

304
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:45,060
That's why I couldn't tell which high school detective it was.

305
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,761
The only clue I had

306
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,766
was the message that my best friend left me before she died.

307
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,968
A high school detective that speaks with a strange accent

308
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,669
suspects me.

309
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,372
Help me. Help me, Natsuki!

310
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:59,374
That's all she left behind.

311
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,484
I see.

312
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:11,486
"A strange accent"

313
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:13,755
Since I've been living abroad for a while,

314
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:16,258
sometimes my Japanese is funny.

315
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:18,460
Hattori speaks with a super Kansai accent,

316
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,662
and Tokitsu talks in old Japanese.

317
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:22,964
That's why you gathered us all here.

318
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,666
Yes, moreover,

319
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:29,571
only you three had strong connections with the police too.

320
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:33,975
Which means that Kudo wasn't included to begin with?

321
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,076
Okay.

322
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:38,480
Yes, I just used his name to call Hakuba over

323
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,982
because Kudo is famous.

324
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,085
And, at this lodge where you gathered all the detectives,

325
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,655
you first put Mr. Tsuchio to sleep and tied him up,

326
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:50,659
created a locked room just like the one at Lavender Manor

327
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,461
and got hold of the target you were after.

328
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:57,465
Yes, if I put the necessary tools in the room

329
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:00,268
filled with the fragrance of lavender,

330
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:04,172
the high school detective would recall the case immediately

331
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,675
and see through the trick.

332
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:11,880
That mansion was really virtually buried in lavender.

333
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,181
Isn't that right,

334
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,585
Mr. Renzo Koya who used to work as the steward of that mansion?

335
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:25,961
Yes, because the lady of the house loved them very much.

336
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:31,266
Miss!

337
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,072
Then, why did you call him here?

338
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:39,574
He knew why the lady of the house committed suicide

339
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:40,775
and yet he didn't say a word about it.

340
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,877
That's because...

341
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,180
Miss, please don't take anymore medicine!

342
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,084
Quiet, let me do as I please!

343
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:52,153
I couldn't say a word

344
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:55,156
to protect the honor of the lady of the house.

345
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:56,958
I thought that suspicion against her

346
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,261
would clear as investigations progressed.

347
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:00,262
"Suspect of Locked Room Murder Commits Suicide"

348
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:03,164
I never imagined something like that would happen.

349
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:06,368
Please accept my apologies.

350
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,670
But... hold it.

351
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,873
If you called these two here that you have a grudge against...

352
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:15,076
Right, nobody will come for you.

353
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,778
Back then, I told the captain of the ship that

354
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:18,179
if he can't keep a secret,

355
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,581
I'm not going to pay him the remainder,

356
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,983
to make sure he wouldn't talk.

357
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,686
I couldn't afford having him run away on me,

358
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:27,255
even if he were to realize what my plan was.

359
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,557
I had that in mind too.

360
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:33,461
As for Tokitsu, he kept explaining his mistaken deduction

361
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:37,866
of the murder at Lavender Manor up to the time he was killed by me.

362
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,068
He was really someone not worth bothering with.

363
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,671
So, you're the one who broke the wireless radio too.

364
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,973
Of course I'm the one who broke it.

365
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:47,375
We all die together.

366
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm sorry, sonny.

367
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,182
No need to apologize!

368
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:57,986
They'll come to save us, I know!

369
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:04,659
You said that you came here a half day earlier than us, right?

370
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,362
Didn't you come here with your own cruiser?

371
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:08,963
No, I just happened to arrive

372
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,966
earlier than scheduled at the harbor.

373
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,169
I heard that it was a lodge that was not in use for a while

374
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,072
and that I was going to be sleeping together with many people so...

375
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:20,775
I looked for a ship that recently shipped daily necessities and food

376
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,077
to an uninhabited island,

377
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,279
and had them bring me here,

378
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,481
after paying a hefty sum of money.

379
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,485
Which means that nobody knows you're here?

380
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:34,055
No, and how about you, haven't you told anybody?

381
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:36,358
Well, I sort of did, but...

382
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:38,560
She's kind of dense.

383
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,261
What?

384
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:44,265
A sound?

385
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,468
What's this sound?

386
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,372
Don't tell me that the generator also broke down.

387
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:52,774
It's not the sound of the generator!

388
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:54,676
Then, what's this sound?

389
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,183
Heiji!

390
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:05,353
It's Kazuha!

391
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,756
Kazuha brought a ship along!

392
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:08,957
Why?

393
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:13,661
Heiji left a message and landmark behind.

394
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:18,566
Yeah, I leave a message saying "Heiji Hattori was here!"

395
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:29,077
Oh, there he is! It's Heiji and Conan too!

396
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,980
Really, it's Heiji!

397
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,883
God, if you spit it out right away,

398
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,086
you wouldn't have had to take on five throws over the shoulder.

399
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:39,554
It was six.

400
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,056
What?

401
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,363
I'm glad there are hot-blooded detectives like you around.

402
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:51,166
I smear the door knob with blood and you break the door down,

403
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,468
then you crack the glass window and break in.

404
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:57,472
Thanks to you, the dead body ends up leaning against the window.

405
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,074
If you charge forward body and all and the entire window falls off,

406
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,476
that's it.

407
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:04,679
Sorry, that I'm so hot tempered and rash.

408
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,283
Nope, to believe that a person is alive

409
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:10,685
till you confirm the person's death

410
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:13,655
is what a famed detective is all about.

411
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,356
Right, sonny?

412
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,465
If god would allow me to...

413
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:27,469
I would really have liked to have a Detective Championship

414
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:29,571
with both of you.

415
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:36,377
If I could only go back to my high school days without worry.

416
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,167
And? Is Kudo there?

417
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,470
I'm not sure.

418
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,975
Of course he's not.

419
00:22:55,783 --> 00:23:01,089
Inoue... Hiroko Inoue's been murdered.

420
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,691
"I've finally found happiness..." she said,

421
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:06,361
and really sounded happy...

422
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:08,262
Could it have been a mere random robbery?

423
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,165
No, something bothers me.

424
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:13,868
Hey, you saw the culprit, didn't you?

425
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,970
Who was it?

426
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,774
Tell me, who the heck was it?

427
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:25,480
Next Conan, "Yellow Alibi"

428
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,882
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:30,284
Local newspaper.

430
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,587
-Haibara, where is your home town? -Doc's place.

431
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,489
-No way. -Indeed.

432
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:35,456
Yeah.
