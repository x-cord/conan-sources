1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,015
I've been here a half day earlier than you all, you see.

2
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:01,715
Come to think of it,

3
00:00:01,715 --> 00:00:04,115
why is there electricity here?

4
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:05,615
Right...

5
00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:07,215
it's an uninhabited island and yet.

6
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,515
A simple generator seems to be in the shed.

7
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,715
Would you like to go take a look?

8
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:13,915
We could go check out the wireless radio

9
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,215
that's supposed to be there while we're at it too.

10
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:27,915
True.

11
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:31,415
Talk about destroyed...

12
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:36,915
So this is the generator,

13
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:39,115
wasn't there a lock to this place?

14
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:42,115
There should've been a padlock.

15
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,215
I'm sure that Mr. Koya had the lock.

16
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,215
The padlock's

17
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:54,515
been forced opened!

18
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:57,315
Talk about a lot of muddy shoe prints...

19
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,915
It's Mr. Tsuchio's,

20
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:02,415
since he's the only one who came outside after it started raining.

21
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,515
Isn't that right, Hakuba?

22
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:07,215
Huh? He's gone.

23
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:10,215
What's with him? He disappeared.

24
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:12,215
It's gone.

25
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:13,915
It's not here.

26
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:19,015
The wire from the toolbox in this person's room is gone after all.

27
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,615
Isn't Hakuba back?

28
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,615
No, wasn't he together with you?

29
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:30,615
By the way, did you find anything after checking the shed?

30
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,315
Well, sort of.

31
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:34,415
No way.

32
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:38,215
The man's drunk.

33
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:41,315
You guys all claim that you're detectives

34
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,615
but you're all no more than green horns

35
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,115
that look capable on the outside.

36
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,515
Then, let's have them listen

37
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:55,215
to the deduction of the green-horn, shall we?

38
00:01:58,215 --> 00:01:59,715
I see.

39
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:02,015
So, that's the story.

40
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:05,915
No doubt about it,

41
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,015
the culprit is...

42
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:08,215
that person.

43
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:10,315
That man.

44
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:11,315
Right?

45
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:15,315
He killed Tokitsu and prepared the locked room.

46
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,715
Mr. Renzo Koya.

47
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:28,615
Well, it's really simple with a little bit of thinking.

48
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,815
Tokitsu said it would take about an hour

49
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:33,715
to rig his room into a locked room.

50
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:37,615
In other words, it was a trick that was that intricate.

51
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,415
You naturally went to check him out

52
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:43,115
just about when the room would be ready and killed him.

53
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,615
It could be carried out very naturally if you used his room

54
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,615
that was prepared for the locked room murder.

55
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:51,215
So, it wouldn't have been possible for Koshimizu who went to the restroom

56
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:54,715
right after Tokitsu said so and left.

57
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,415
Nor for Mr. Tsuchio who left 30 minutes later

58
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:59,415
to his room to get his cigarette

59
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:00,815
to commit the murder.

60
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:04,015
In other words, you, Mr. Renzo Koya, who went to see him alone

61
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,915
just before he was found killed in the locked room

62
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:09,515
is the only one

63
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,115
who could've killed him.

64
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,815
Oh, boy...

65
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:17,215
How much do you have to disappoint me before you stop?

66
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:20,715
I'm sorry to say that he's not the one.

67
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:22,515
Because the one who committed the crime

68
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:26,415
is one who can unlock and lock doors and windows just by using a wire.

69
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,415
That person is Mr. Tsuchio.

70
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,115
It's you.

71
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:33,115
Don't be ridiculous!

72
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:35,815
The padlock that was on the shed that you headed for

73
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,015
after lying that you were going to go get your cigarette.

74
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,915
New traces of it having been forced opened were seen,

75
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,815
moreover, it found wet and thrown into the shed.

76
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:48,215
In other words, the one who forced the door open was Mr. Tsuchio,

77
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,415
the only one who went outside after it began raining.

78
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,715
On top of that, only the wire was found missing

79
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,515
from the toolbox in your room.

80
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,815
How did he make the locked room, though?

81
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,515
Mr. Tsuchio mentioned that

82
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,315
he came here three days ago to check the place out beforehand.

83
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,015
At that time he probably,

84
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:07,515
opened a small hole in the window of that room.

85
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,215
Then, after killing Mr. Tokitsu tonight,

86
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:11,815
he went outside from the window,

87
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,515
and from the hole in the glass he made previously,

88
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:16,515
used the wire to lock the window,

89
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:22,315
He probably figured beforehand that Hattori

90
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,015
would break through the window glass later

91
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,415
and make a grand entrance into the room,

92
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:29,915
making it impossible to find the hole made in the glass.

93
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:33,115
He then went to destroy the wireless radio in the shed,

94
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:36,415
to breed anxiety in us and corner us mentally.

95
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,215
He was ready to kill another one of us after that!

96
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:40,615
Isn't that right?

97
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:41,915
No way!

98
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,815
I don't think so.

99
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:49,115
Even if he were able to predict that

100
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,615
Heiji would break through the glass window,

101
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,615
he wouldn't have been able to tell

102
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,515
which of the four windows he would break through!

103
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,915
Besides, although Heiji is hot tempered,

104
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,215
I'm sure he would've noticed if there was a hole.

105
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,515
Never mind the hot tempered.

106
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:06,015
But the one who forced opened the padlock of the shed

107
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,615
is unmistakably him.

108
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:11,115
Yeah, it's true that this man has a bad habit,

109
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,315
but that's about it.

110
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:16,115
Or, is it that you have an equation in your head

111
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,515
that says, "A thief is the killer?"

112
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,215
I guess I goofed.

113
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:26,215
So, what with the locked room, trick?

114
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:28,815
Yep, it's a super simple trick!

115
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:31,815
First, you remove all the screws holding the window frames in place.

116
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:33,515
Then, you remove the windows.

117
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:37,515
Finally, cut all the screws short using pliers and all set!

118
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,515
Then you insert the head of the screw that had been cut off

119
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:40,715
back into the window frame,

120
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,115
and put glue on the area around the window frame.

121
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:46,615
Then, you go outside and fix the entire window in place.

122
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:49,415
In other words, it looks like the window is fixed on with screws,

123
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,415
but the inside is not.

124
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:55,915
The window was just glued on.

125
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:58,615
-And, the one who could've done that is... -Hold it.

126
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:02,015
Right, the very last person who went to Mr. Tokitsu's room...

127
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,115
Mr. Koya.

128
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,515
No one other than you could've done it!

129
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,315
What're you talking about, Heiji? He's...

130
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:10,315
You caught Tokitsu who was taking

131
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,715
his good old time absorbed in the trick off guard,

132
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,115
hit him and killed him.

133
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:18,015
No, I hate to interrupt you but...

134
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:19,615
Mr. Koya couldn't have carried the trick out.

135
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,515
I've got proof too.

136
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,515
This screw with the head cut off that I found in Tokitsu's room!

137
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,415
This guy...

138
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,115
Don't tell me that...

139
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:51,915
"Green. Message from Heiji" -Well?

140
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,115
"Green. Message from Heiji" -This is what you call

141
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:53,492
"Green. Message from Heiji" -conclusive evidence!

142
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,687
But, why did you gather us high school detectives

143
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,887
and do something like this?

144
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:04,187
I wanted to find out about something.

145
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,787
And, what's that?

146
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:09,487
The homicide at Lavender Manor.

147
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,987
You wanted to know who the high school detective that solved it was, right?

148
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:13,287
Yes.

149
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,787
Then, you mean it was... Tokitsu?

150
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:22,287
Although the name and details of the case wasn't written in the papers.

151
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:25,587
Yes, he happened to drop by at the mansion

152
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,687
while traveling through Shikoku,

153
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:31,987
solved the locked room case and left without saying his name.

154
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,087
Because of him,

155
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:36,987
my best friend who was working as a housekeeper there was suspected.

156
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,087
She was suspected on the grounds

157
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:42,387
that she was with the lady of the house, just two of them together.

158
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:46,987
I also went to that mansion as a detective,

159
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,887
a month before that man appeared.

160
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,887
My best friend asked me to investigate the case

161
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:55,187
because it could be a homicide.

162
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:05,387
But, I couldn't come up with anything.

163
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,887
I couldn't think of anything other than the fact that

164
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:11,687
she had locked herself in her room and committed suicide.

165
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:16,087
Then, why was your best friend suspected?

166
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:19,687
The high school detective that came two months later

167
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,587
found outside the window of her room

168
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,887
scattered screws with heads cut off

169
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:30,587
as well as the fact that the window was only pasted on with glue.

170
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,887
You mean you overlooked it?

171
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:34,687
Overlooked it my foot.

172
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,287
The man called Tsuchio

173
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,487
disguised himself as a cleaning staff

174
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,787
and set up the trick.

175
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:44,387
He probably rigged the window so that it would come off easily,

176
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:47,887
when he planned to come back to rob the house later.

177
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:51,087
That's why when you heard of the Lavender Manor,

178
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:55,087
you went pale and wanted to escape from the island.

179
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,187
Six months after the incident,

180
00:10:57,187 --> 00:10:59,487
Tokitsu jumps onto the trick,

181
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,587
as if to boast his power of deduction,

182
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:05,187
reports to the police and the media that this is a homicide.

183
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:06,487
"New Truth Disclosed on Suicide of the Lady of Lavender Manor"

184
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,987
"Police Conclude it to be Locked Room Homicide!"

185
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,387
"Suspect Still Denies Charges"

186
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:12,287
If the rust of the screws were checked,

187
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:13,487
it would've been obvious whether it had anything

188
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:15,487
to do with the case or not.

189
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,187
Tokitsu, realized that something was not right,

190
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:20,587
so he didn't disclose his name.

191
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:24,887
That's why I couldn't tell which high school detective it was.

192
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,587
The only clue I had

193
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:30,587
was the message that my best friend left me before she died.

194
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,787
A high school detective that speaks with a strange accent

195
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,487
suspects me.

196
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:37,187
Help me. Help me, Natsuki!

197
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,187
That's all she left behind.

198
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,287
I see.

199
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,287
"A strange accent"

200
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,587
Since I've been living abroad for a while,

201
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,087
sometimes my Japanese is funny.

202
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,287
Hattori speaks with a super Kansai accent,

203
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,487
and Tokitsu talks in old Japanese.

204
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,787
That's why you gathered us all here.

205
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,487
Yes, moreover,

206
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:09,387
only you three had strong connections with the police too.

207
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:13,787
Which means that Kudo wasn't included to begin with?

208
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:14,887
Okay.

209
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:18,287
Yes, I just used his name to call Hakuba over

210
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,787
because Kudo is famous.

211
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:23,887
And, at this lodge where you gathered all the detectives,

212
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:26,487
you first put Mr. Tsuchio to sleep and tied him up,

213
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:30,487
created a locked room just like the one at Lavender Manor

214
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:33,287
and got hold of the target you were after.

215
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:37,287
Yes, if I put the necessary tools in the room

216
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:40,087
filled with the fragrance of lavender,

217
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:43,987
the high school detective would recall the case immediately

218
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:46,487
and see through the trick.

219
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:51,687
That mansion was really virtually buried in lavender.

220
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,987
Isn't that right,

221
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:56,387
Mr. Renzo Koya who used to work as the steward of that mansion?

222
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:05,787
Yes, because the lady of the house loved them very much.

223
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,087
Miss!

224
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,887
Then, why did you call him here?

225
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,387
He knew why the lady of the house committed suicide

226
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:20,587
and yet he didn't say a word about it.

227
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,687
That's because...

228
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:24,987
Miss, please don't take anymore medicine!

229
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:28,887
Quiet, let me do as I please!

230
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,987
I couldn't say a word

231
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:34,987
to protect the honor of the lady of the house.

232
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:36,787
I thought that suspicion against her

233
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:39,087
would clear as investigations progressed.

234
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:40,087
"Suspect of Locked Room Murder Commits Suicide"

235
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,987
I never imagined something like that would happen.

236
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:46,187
Please accept my apologies.

237
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,487
But... hold it.

238
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,687
If you called these two here that you have a grudge against...

239
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,887
Right, nobody will come for you.

240
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,587
Back then, I told the captain of the ship that

241
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:57,987
if he can't keep a secret,

242
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,387
I'm not going to pay him the remainder,

243
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,787
to make sure he wouldn't talk.

244
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,487
I couldn't afford having him run away on me,

245
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,087
even if he were to realize what my plan was.

246
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:09,387
I had that in mind too.

247
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:13,287
As for Tokitsu, he kept explaining his mistaken deduction

248
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:17,687
of the murder at Lavender Manor up to the time he was killed by me.

249
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,887
He was really someone not worth bothering with.

250
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,487
So, you're the one who broke the wireless radio too.

251
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,787
Of course I'm the one who broke it.

252
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:27,187
We all die together.

253
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,687
I'm sorry, sonny.

254
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,987
No need to apologize!

255
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:37,787
They'll come to save us, I know!

256
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:44,487
You said that you came here a half day earlier than us, right?

257
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,187
Didn't you come here with your own cruiser?

258
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,787
No, I just happened to arrive

259
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,787
earlier than scheduled at the harbor.

260
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,987
I heard that it was a lodge that was not in use for a while

261
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:56,887
and that I was going to be sleeping together with many people so...

262
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:00,587
I looked for a ship that recently shipped daily necessities and food

263
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:01,887
to an uninhabited island,

264
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,087
and had them bring me here,

265
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,287
after paying a hefty sum of money.

266
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:10,287
Which means that nobody knows you're here?

267
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:13,887
No, and how about you, haven't you told anybody?

268
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:16,187
Well, I sort of did, but...

269
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,387
She's kind of dense.

270
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,087
What?

271
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,087
A sound?

272
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:26,287
What's this sound?

273
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,187
Don't tell me that the generator also broke down.

274
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:32,587
It's not the sound of the generator!

275
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:34,487
Then, what's this sound?

276
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:41,987
Heiji!

277
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,187
It's Kazuha!

278
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,587
Kazuha brought a ship along!

279
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,787
Why?

280
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:53,487
Heiji left a message and landmark behind.

281
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:58,387
Yeah, I leave a message saying "Heiji Hattori was here!"

282
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:08,887
Oh, there he is! It's Heiji and Conan too!

283
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,787
Really, it's Heiji!

284
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:14,687
God, if you spit it out right away,

285
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,887
you wouldn't have had to take on five throws over the shoulder.

286
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,387
It was six.

287
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,887
What?

288
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:28,187
I'm glad there are hot-blooded detectives like you around.

289
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,987
I smear the door knob with blood and you break the door down,

290
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,287
then you crack the glass window and break in.

291
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:37,287
Thanks to you, the dead body ends up leaning against the window.

292
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,887
If you charge forward body and all and the entire window falls off,

293
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:41,287
that's it.

294
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:44,487
Sorry, that I'm so hot tempered and rash.

295
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:48,087
Nope, to believe that a person is alive

296
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,487
till you confirm the person's death

297
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,487
is what a famed detective is all about.

298
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,187
Right, sonny?

299
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,287
If god would allow me to...

300
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:07,287
I would really have liked to have a Detective Championship

301
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,387
with both of you.

302
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:16,187
If I could only go back to my high school days without worry.

303
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,987
And? Is Kudo there?

304
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,287
I'm not sure.

305
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:53,787
Of course he's not.

306
00:18:55,687 --> 00:19:00,987
Inoue... Hiroko Inoue's been murdered.

307
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,587
"I've finally found happiness..." she said,

308
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,287
and really sounded happy...

309
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,187
Could it have been a mere random robbery?

310
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:11,087
No, something bothers me.

311
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:13,787
Hey, you saw the culprit, didn't you?

312
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,887
Who was it?

313
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,687
Tell me, who the heck was it?

314
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:25,387
Next Conan, "Yellow Alibi"

315
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,787
Next Conan's Hint:

316
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:30,187
Local newspaper.

317
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:32,487
-Haibara, where is your home town? -Doc's place.

318
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,387
-No way. -Indeed.

319
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:35,387
Yeah.
