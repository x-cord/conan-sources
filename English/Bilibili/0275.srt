1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,424
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:04,224
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:05,724
At a creepy looking apartment

4
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,724
hiding an unexpected trick.

5
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:13,924
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,411
We met a grandpa at Araide Clinic

9
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:07,011
and heard a bizarre ghost story from him.

10
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:09,111
Then we came to his small old apartment house

11
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:11,211
which he said was haunted.

12
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:16,211
Incidentally, there is a building next to his apartment house.

13
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,011
The builder had committed suicide

14
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:19,411
after the bursting of the financial bubble.

15
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:25,911
There is a park in front of his apartment house too,

16
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,511
where the burned body of a young woman was previously found.

17
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:30,911
This place has many eerie stories surrounding it,

18
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:32,411
and we fell asleep while waiting in grandfather's room

19
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:34,311
for the ghost to appear.

20
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:40,311
Go home.

21
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,711
Go home.

22
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:49,311
Get out...

23
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:51,311
immediately!

24
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:53,811
And...

25
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:56,511
The toilet water turned red.

26
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,811
A spooky figure looks in through the window from outside.

27
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:03,111
Also, there is a death candle floating

28
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:05,311
spotted in the building next door.

29
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,611
What does this mean anyhow?

30
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,911
The ghost appearing on the TV screen after suddenly going fainted,

31
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:20,611
the toilet water suddenly turning red...

32
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:23,311
Both can be explained scientifically

33
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,711
but what about the other two phenomenon,

34
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,311
the death candle and the figure in the window?

35
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,511
I just can't seem to figure them out.

36
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,511
How did the culprit do them?

37
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,811
Was there a culprit in the first place?

38
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:43,011
If one did exist, who could it be?

39
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,211
And for what purpose is the culprit doing all this for?

40
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:57,311
"Truth of the Haunted House (Part 2)"

41
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,511
Conan.

42
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:05,011
What're you looking at with the window open?

43
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,011
The bugs will come flying in again.

44
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,211
Well, I'm wondering just about where

45
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,511
that gramps saw the death candle in that building.

46
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:17,811
The spot where I saw it

47
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:19,411
is in the darkness around the center of that building.

48
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:23,811
The red light alone was looming and moving about in the air.

49
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:27,011
At times it turned a bluish white light.

50
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,611
If you don't believe me,

51
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:34,911
go ask Mr. Yotsuya of Room 2 and Mr. Bancho of Room 4.

52
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:38,911
Each of them said that they once also saw the death candle.

53
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,011
Oh, yeah, I saw...

54
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,811
A red one and blue death candle as well,

55
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:46,511
when I visited the room where my senior at school was living.

56
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,511
Your senior?

57
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:48,511
Yeah.

58
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:53,011
Just up there. It's the room right above this one.

59
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:56,011
Room 6 is where my senior was living.

60
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,411
But since then,

61
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,411
he was unable to sleep properly

62
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,011
because he was seized with fear of the death candles.

63
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,511
He finally moved out.

64
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,911
I was unable to sleep either,

65
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,411
not because of fright, but rather, because of being overexcited.

66
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,411
Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:16,511
Hey, this is a 8mm movie projector, right?

68
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,511
Yeah.

69
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:21,811
I'm now using it to edit a movie filmed by our film club in college.

70
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:24,411
But this room is bloody awful,

71
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,111
full of sick horror magazines and posters.

72
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,211
It's really scary.

73
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,511
I feel I'm going to have nightmares just being here.

74
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,811
Still, all this is nothing compared to Room 4

75
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:35,911
where Mr. Bancho lives.

76
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,111
What?

77
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:39,911
"Room 4, Bancho"

78
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:42,611
This room is really something.

79
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,411
There're tons of the ghost and monster figures here!

80
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,611
"Kikuji Bancho (34)" -You haven't seen anything yet.

81
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:51,211
I turn the light off like so.

82
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:57,411
The figures are glowing various colors in the dark!

83
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,911
It's because of this black light.

84
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:04,011
The special kind of fluorescent coating painted on the figures

85
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,411
reacts to black light making them glow like a neon tube.

86
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:08,911
You know a lot, sonny.

87
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,811
A toy store owner told me about it.

88
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,511
By the way, you also saw the death candle, right?

89
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,511
Yeah, I did,

90
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:17,811
but I saw it through that window,

91
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,811
not the window facing that building.

92
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,511
This window...

93
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,611
is located diagonally below the window where the figure appeared.

94
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,011
Hey, kid.

95
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:31,111
I think you better close the window now.

96
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:33,711
Do it for your sister's sake.

97
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:37,011
But, in fact, a couple of moths have already entered.

98
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,311
If you don't believe the ghost story I told you,

99
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:45,011
you better go talk with Botan of Room 1!

100
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,211
That square grad student with a square head!

101
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:52,011
Yeah. I've never seen it before.

102
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:56,611
I believe nothing but what I can comprehend scientifically.

103
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,211
"Tsuyuhiko Botan (27)" -But you know what I hate more than that now?

104
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:02,811
That building opposite here that is still half done.

105
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:05,211
Which means?

106
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,411
Look at these.

107
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,411
That building shuts out the sunlight,

108
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:12,311
so the sun rarely shines into the room.

109
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:15,011
That's certainly true.

110
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:17,511
Mr. Otonashi's room diagonally above is much better than mine.

111
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,011
Because it has a window facing the street side.

112
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,711
So, why don't you move out?

113
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,411
Because the rent is so cheap

114
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,611
and my grandma told me that this place had good feng shui.

115
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:33,711
Did you say you believe only what you can comprehend scientifically?

116
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:36,611
Excuse me.

117
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,311
May I smoke here?

118
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,011
Oh, sure, please.

119
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,311
But please leave after you finish smoking the cigarette!

120
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,411
Sure.

121
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:45,511
Cigarette?

122
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:51,511
Dad, your arm!

123
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:52,911
A moth again!

124
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,311
Darn! Why always me?

125
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,211
Get them out of the room quickly! Now!

126
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,511
That's what I'm trying to do now!

127
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,111
I see.

128
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,411
The culprits were afraid

129
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,911
that the murder they committed would be revealed.

130
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:20,311
So they tried to destroy the decisive evidence

131
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,011
of the woman that they burned to death 4 years ago.

132
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:28,611
They used ghosts to cover up the evil doing.

133
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,811
What?

134
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,411
Are you leaving already?

135
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,711
The night's still young.

136
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:36,811
You may be missing out on seeing

137
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:39,411
one of the eeriest ghosts you've ever seen before.

138
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:41,311
Too bad you're leaving.

139
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:43,611
Well, it's perfectly all right with me if you leave now.

140
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,811
That way I can get on with my paper.

141
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:50,511
Okay, buddy, take it easy, say hello to the ghost for me.

142
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,411
How unsociable they are.

143
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,611
Haunted by the ghost, my eye?

144
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,411
Making such a big fuss over illusion.

145
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,411
Where is Conan?

146
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,111
There he is.

147
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:04,611
Hey! We're going home now!

148
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,711
I've got to go pee,

149
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,511
but I'm a bit scared to go alone.

150
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:12,811
Hey, pops, please go with me?

151
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,811
Oh, man.

152
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:16,411
Come on, why should I?

153
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,711
All right, all right.

154
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:19,511
I'll be waiting outside then.

155
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:29,911
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

156
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,311
Who's there?

157
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,011
Sonny.

158
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,611
I thought you went home.

159
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,511
We've got trouble.

160
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:44,711
Trouble?

161
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:48,311
Look. That restroom is cursed. No doubt about it.

162
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:52,511
It's so stinky and I can't flush the toilet.

163
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,611
It sure smells, but...

164
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:02,611
There seems no problem with flushing.

165
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,211
Water is...

166
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:10,411
Water is turning red...

167
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,711
That...

168
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,211
That can't be true.

169
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:17,511
Oh, boy. Now, the TV in your room is cursed.

170
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,411
-What? -Look, over there.

171
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,211
Go home. Go home.

172
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,611
The ghost! That's the ghost! What should we do?

173
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,911
-Get out immediately! -This can't be happening...

174
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:32,711
-Go home. -This can't be happening...

175
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:34,111
What're you doing?

176
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,611
There is no tape inside.

177
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,511
Who is it?

178
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,411
Who the heck is doing this?

179
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,061
What?

180
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:08,861
So it appeared again. The ghost.

181
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:10,261
No, no way.

182
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,861
There must be something wrong here.

183
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,361
Because everything was...

184
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,961
Yeah.

185
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:21,261
They were all tricks to make it look like the works of the ghost.

186
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:23,661
You're saying that nobody but you

187
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:27,161
could have set the tricks up because you created them,

188
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:30,461
isn't that right, Mr. Bancho?

189
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,261
Tricks! How can you say that?

190
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,361
Man, you're acting like a detective or something...

191
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,661
Detective?

192
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:43,261
Don't tell me you are the renowned detective, "Sleeping Kogoro."

193
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,161
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:48,461
Now I'm going to unlock

195
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:52,961
the mysteries of a lot of psychic phenomena.

196
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:56,561
First of all, about the toilet water turning red.

197
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,061
What I noticed about it was that, when I entered the restroom,

198
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:02,961
it smelled awfully of ammonia,

199
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:07,561
and that the toilet tank smelled faintly of alcohol.

200
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,861
Ammonia and alcohol?

201
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:12,861
Perhaps you did an experiment in science in

202
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:15,561
your elementary school days, remember?

203
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:19,661
When you add one drop of alkaline ammonia water

204
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:24,061
to the colorless phenolphthalein solution dissolved in alcohol,

205
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:27,861
the red color will appear like magic.

206
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:30,861
Yeah, but I wonder if it would work out that well?

207
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:34,461
The color in the experiment isn't bright red but pinkish red.

208
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,361
The color could never be mistaken.

209
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:37,361
Yeah, true.

210
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:42,561
But it would look like blood in a dimly-lit restroom like here.

211
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:47,061
Well, even so, there is no chemical reaction with urine

212
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:53,561
because ammonia in our urine is acid or neutral,

213
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,761
not alkaline.

214
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:59,761
Yes, that's why he needed...

215
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,761
This ammonia liquid.

216
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,761
It's...

217
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:06,861
This is poured into the water in the toilet bowl

218
00:13:06,861 --> 00:13:09,661
then phenolphthalein is poured into the water in the toilet tank.

219
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,961
Then chemical reaction will occur

220
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:14,861
and nobody would suspect the strong smell of ammonia,

221
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,761
seeing this dirty restroom.

222
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,661
Exactly.

223
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:22,261
But, where did you get that chemical, sonny?

224
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,461
Pops asked me to look for it.

225
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:27,161
So when you were saying goodbye at the entrance,

226
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:30,061
I slipped into the room and found it...

227
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,061
in this room, Mr. Bancho.

228
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:35,261
I also found other interesting things

229
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:39,561
like phenolphthalein and chloroform.

230
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:42,561
And even a video tape of a scary movie.

231
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,461
A scary movie video tape?

232
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:45,561
Yeah!

233
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:51,661
The tape with a ghost woman saying, "Go home, go home.".

234
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:52,961
Hey...

235
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,761
Don't tell me that...

236
00:13:54,761 --> 00:14:02,561
Yes. The ghost that my daughter, Ran saw on the TV screen...

237
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:07,761
are the pictures Mr. Bancho transmitted from the VCR in his room.

238
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:10,761
He sent the pictures! How?

239
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:12,361
It's simple and easy

240
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:15,761
if you use the public antenna of this building.

241
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:22,261
Plug the antenna cord into the output terminal of the VCR in his room

242
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,861
and transmit video pictures to the antenna.

243
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:29,761
Then the antenna sends the pictures to the TV

244
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:32,761
in Mr. Otonashi's room.

245
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:35,761
But, in order to do that,

246
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,661
you have to be able to set the TV channel

247
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,861
to the appropriate channel to receive the pictures.

248
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:43,461
And you must turn on the TV first, how do you think...

249
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,361
It's a multi channel remote control.

250
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,161
Mr. Otonashi.

251
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,161
Once you enter your TV or VCR's manufacturer name into the device,

252
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:54,761
you can operate any TV or VCR made by the manufacturer.

253
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,361
So you can operate the TV in someone else's room on

254
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,161
without the owner realizing a thing.

255
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,761
Well, after finding out how the trick worked,

256
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,461
it was a piece of cake even for me.

257
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:04,061
Don't tell me.

258
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,861
This old man was the one who sent the images

259
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,761
to my TV screen a while ago.

260
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:12,461
Yeah, I got him to help me send the video I just "borrowed" from you.

261
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,861
You used the remote control

262
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:19,461
from outside the window of Mr. Othonashi's room,

263
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:23,561
facing the building under construction.

264
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,961
Using the wall as a foothold,

265
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:32,261
you could easily send the signals to his TV set from there.

266
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,661
You didn't even need to watch the TV screen

267
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,561
as you can listen to the sound and set the channel.

268
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,461
And while the sun was still up,

269
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,961
you poured the chloroform onto the windowsill

270
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:47,361
so that all of us who were in the room would fall asleep.

271
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,861
You thought you could make

272
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,361
one of us who suddenly fainted

273
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:57,361
and got up in the dark room, still hazy in the head

274
00:15:57,361 --> 00:16:00,261
see an eerie illusion. Isn't that right?

275
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:02,461
I see.

276
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,261
But, that was for real, wasn't it?

277
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:09,361
I mean the figure of a person that has been looking this way.

278
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:12,961
Oh, that's not a figure of a person at all!

279
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:14,461
-What? -Go over and look closer,

280
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:16,161
you'll see what it is.

281
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,261
This is a...

282
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:24,561
moth!

283
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,661
Moths gathered in large numbers.

284
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,161
Or, to put it more precisely,

285
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,561
it's an aggregate of male moths.

286
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,161
He coated the screen in a human shape

287
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,661
with female moth pheromone,

288
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,361
that is also used as an insecticide,

289
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:40,661
and stuck eyes and a mouth made from black paper on it.

290
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:43,761
The male moths that were attracted to the scent of the pheromone,

291
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,461
clustered on it to make it look like a human shadow

292
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:47,761
was looking inside through the window.

293
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:52,761
In fact, moths kept approaching my arm several times.

294
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:56,161
When I almost fell from the window

295
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,961
where I saw the figure for the first time,

296
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:04,761
I found myself grabbing the screen,

297
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:07,561
and got the pheromone on my arm, which attracted moths to me.

298
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,761
So, that is...

299
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,261
I simply removed the screen on the second floor

300
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:15,361
and placed it by window on the first floor. That's all.

301
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:19,661
Incidentally, the reason why the figure started disappearing on its own

302
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:24,161
is because Mr. Bancho's black light that was activated by a timer

303
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:28,561
was emitted from the window of his room diagonally below.

304
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,361
Moths are more prone to be attracted

305
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:36,461
by ultraviolet light emitted by the black lights, than the pheromone.

306
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:41,461
But the trick would be disclosed if even one moth remains.

307
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,761
That's why Mr. Bancho hurried across to the window,

308
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:47,261
as soon as the moths began to fly out,

309
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,261
then opened the window and screen together.

310
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:54,961
The force of the impact knocked the moths off the screen completely.

311
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:58,861
Mr. Bancho, you pretended not to notice the moths

312
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,361
even when you got close to the window, right?

313
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:08,061
That's because you intentionally caused this uproar over the ghost!

314
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:11,261
But, I still don't understand.

315
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:16,861
All the chemicals besides the chloroform can be gotten easily, but why...

316
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,461
Right.

317
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:22,361
Mr. Bancho could've easily made the video himself,

318
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:24,461
by using his scary figures and his falsetto...

319
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:28,961
Why'd he go through the trouble of making up a ghost story?

320
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:32,661
He attempted to scare us, Mr. Otonashi's guests,

321
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,661
to get Mr. Otonashi who refused to move out of here

322
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:38,161
to decide to do so after all this ghost scare.

323
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:42,761
Perhaps, in order to cover up the crime four years ago.

324
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,461
The crime four years ago?

325
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,261
You mean the murder of the woman burned to death

326
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,661
in the park right before us?

327
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:56,061
You say you saw the death candle in that building under construction?

328
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,961
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,961
What was drifting in the air wasn't the death candle,

330
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:02,761
but a lit cigarette.

331
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,561
What was glowing bluish white

332
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:11,261
was the light of portable TV that was secretly being watched.

333
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:15,961
Don't tell me there's someone in that building?

334
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:18,161
Yeah, taking advantage of the fact

335
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,661
that the building is still under construction,

336
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,561
he's been living in hiding there.

337
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,761
He is one of the two murderers

338
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:28,361
who was witnessed four years ago,

339
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:31,961
that has a scar across his cheek.

340
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:36,561
Perhaps, Mr. Bancho is one of the two murderers,

341
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:39,361
whose face wasn't witnessed.

342
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,261
As the light of the cigarette was witnessed

343
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:46,061
and the fact that somebody lived here was about to be disclosed,

344
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,261
you fabricated and accelerated the plot about the ghost girl,

345
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,861
you chased the residents of the second floor of this apartment out

346
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,061
one after the other, because they were the only people

347
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,961
who could look inside the building from their room!

348
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,461
If he had been caught,

349
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,961
he would have name his accomplice from four years ago

350
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:04,561
and you would have gone to prison.

351
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,561
The reason that you're living here

352
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:10,261
is to bring the guy with the scar across his cheek, his food and drinks,

353
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:13,661
because his scar will give him away.

354
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,961
I guess you were planning to sneak out

355
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:20,461
after things settled down a bit, but too late now.

356
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:23,361
See, you can hear it, can't you?

357
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:26,061
The footsteps of doom.

358
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:29,561
The siren of the police car that I called.

359
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,461
Darn it!

360
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:37,961
Out of the way, move!

361
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,761
Wait...

362
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:41,861
Ran, don't get pass you!

363
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:42,861
What?

364
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,661
Out of my way, lady

365
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,361
or I'll curse you to death!

366
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:48,561
Just what did you say?

367
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,161
If you're not a ghost, you don't scare me at all!

368
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,561
Back fist.

369
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:16,061
The police arrived there soon after.

370
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:18,861
The host of this haunted house

371
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,761
and the "death candle" man hiding in the building were arrested.

372
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,061
The case of the haunted house scare

373
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,661
together with the murder case that occurred four years ago,

374
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,061
came to a close.

375
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:30,861
Incidentally, the murder four years ago was committed

376
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:34,061
because of money trouble.

377
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:39,161
What a worldly case over money behind an unworldly ghost case.

378
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:13,961
So, all those ghosts were tricks after all.

379
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,861
Yeah. I don't give a hoot about them anymore.

380
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,661
They don't exist.

381
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:22,861
What's wrong, Sonoko?

382
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,861
Hey, Sonoko.

383
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:31,761
Are you crying? Why?

384
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:32,761
Because...

385
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,761
Because with you talking like that,

386
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,461
I can't show my true self, can I?

387
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,061
No!

388
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,461
I give myself credit for this perfect makeup!

389
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:50,561
Ran's boogey phobia is one of her charm points

390
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:53,161
so it's a waste to cure it.

391
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:55,861
-Don't you think so? -Yeah.

392
00:23:55,861 --> 00:23:59,261
I think you should do something about your personality first.

393
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:10,261
"Next Episode"

394
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:19,761
Officer Takagi?

395
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:21,961
What is he looking for?

396
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:28,961
This is no good at all.

397
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,161
Next Conan,

398
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Policeman's Missing Notebook Case"

399
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:38,079
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,379
"All-you-can-eat"
