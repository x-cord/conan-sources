1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.270
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.470
Let's heal hearts dried by
modern society with Conan's logic!

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.010
Today's case has Ran-neechan
playing an important part!

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.190
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.270
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.970
His name?

7
00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.559
Ran, the old man,
and I attended the Izu Mystery Tour

8
00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:44.389
in place of Professor Agasa, his friend,
and his friend's granddaughter.

9
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:49.819
The anonymous tour organizer
would play the Night Baron

10
00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.279
and cause an incident during the tour.

11
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:58.059
Whoever determines the organizer's
identity gets to stay for free

12
00:01:58.059 --> 00:02:01.849
and receives floppy disks
containing a certain program.

13
00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.659
The attendees
keep each other in check...

14
00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.389
The Night Baron pushed me
off a balcony when I was all alone.

15
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.439
I fell into a pool.

16
00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.889
Was this a warning?
Or just part of the game?

17
00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.429
And then it happened...

18
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.429
The Night Baron plummeted
onto a bronze statue!

19
00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.649
The Night Baron Murder Case (The Suspicion).

20
00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.589
Izu Princess Hotel

21
00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.549
A person wearing a mask?!

22
00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.309
So it was the
Night Baron who fell!

23
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.849
Conan-kun!

24
00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.269
Hold it, kid!

25
00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.729
Sorry!

26
00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.739
Oh? Don't you live
with Detective Mori?

27
00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.029
Conan-kun! You know better!

28
00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.659
I deeply apologize!

29
00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.999
If it isn't Ran-san!

30
00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.369
Huh?

31
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.659
Yokomizo-san from the
Saitama police department?

32
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.859
Yep!

33
00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.779
But what are you doing here?

34
00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.849
I transferred to Shizuoka last month.
Detective Yokomizo

35
00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.699
I transferred to Shizuoka last month.

36
00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.879
Huh?

37
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.139
Hey, now!

38
00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.939
Ebara-san!

39
00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.489
You know him?!

40
00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.349
Yes!

41
00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.809
He was on the same
Mystery Tour as us...

42
00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.479
Mystery Tour?!

43
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.669
He only has one glove on...

44
00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.159
I see.

45
00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.029
So the goal is to figure out who
the organizer and Night Baron is.

46
00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:57.079
Which means the organizer
was Ebara-san here.

47
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.159
A suicide? An accident?
Or maybe a--

48
00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.389
Say, where is Detective Mori?

49
00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.809
Well, he's--

50
00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.989
In the pub on the 2nd floor.

51
00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:11.949
Huh?!

52
00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.639
Kamijo-san!

53
00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.659
Anyway, let's have a talk with him!

54
00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.289
Alright. Come on, Conan-kun!

55
00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.069
This way!

56
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.109
Wait for me!

57
00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:25.489
Tears?

58
00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.829
Princess Hotel 2F Pub Emerald

59
00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:35.789
What a time for Dad to get plastered!

60
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.609
I see...

61
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:45.529
What?! Ebara-san fell off
dressed as the Night Baron?!

62
00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.639
Yes, according to eyewitnesses,
he fell at precisely 10:00!

63
00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.949
What's with the hands?

64
00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.319
It's your smell...

65
00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.359
10:00, huh?

66
00:04:58.359 --> 00:04:59.069
What is it?

67
00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.569
Whoa! It's already this late?!

68
00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.529
So, did you check Room 2101,
where he was staying?

69
00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.989
We tried to, but we
couldn't get inside.

70
00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.909
A security lock on the inside...

71
00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:19.829
Cut through it!

72
00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:32.219
Okay! We're in!

73
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:37.659
There are clothes here.

74
00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.809
Those are the ones
he was wearing today.

75
00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:44.159
He even left his room key here.

76
00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.529
Come to think of it,
he was pretty drunk...

77
00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.849
The window's open.

78
00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.739
And there's a veranda outside...

79
00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.849
It would appear
this is where he fell from.

80
00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.279
Careful, Detective Mori.

81
00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.879
This was just a simple accident.

82
00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:11.219
An accident?!

83
00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:15.429
No doubt about it.
There's a glove in the railing.

84
00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:16.659
Eh?!

85
00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.699
He probably tried to climb down
the veranda in that costume

86
00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.279
to scare the attendee
in the room below.

87
00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.279
But he screwed up
and fell to his death.

88
00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.489
I dunno...

89
00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.779
This is the 21st floor.

90
00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.449
Would he really try to
go down without a rope?

91
00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:39.409
Plus, the key was inside the room.

92
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.499
If he did make it to the room
below and then left through it,

93
00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:48.459
he would've needed
the key to get back in here.

94
00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:49.629
Quiet, you!

95
00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:57.139
My pen!

96
00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.029
Anyway, let me
have a look at the body.

97
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.939
Right.

98
00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.149
Seeing it won't
change anything, though.

99
00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.489
Oh, man...

100
00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:18.199
So he fell twenty-one
stories onto that statue...

101
00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.859
Has anyone gotten near the body?

102
00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:25.659
No, sir. Aside from us, only one
other person has touched him.

103
00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:26.789
That little boy there.

104
00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.089
That brat again?!

105
00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.009
What're you doing, Conan-kun?

106
00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.099
I can't find the pen that I dropped...

107
00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:45.449
Is it true that Ebara-san
was the one who fell, Mori-san?

108
00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:48.769
No question about it.
It was Ebara Tokio.

109
00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.189
And he had a mask on.

110
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:52.899
A mask?!

111
00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:59.239
I see. So he was the tour
organizer and the Night Baron.

112
00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:04.489
I knew it. I always
thought he was suspicious.

113
00:08:04.489 --> 00:08:06.079
Knock it off. This isn't the time.

114
00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:12.259
Though it is disturbing that the
immortal Night Baron would perish...

115
00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:15.089
Who are these people?

116
00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.719
Members of the same tour I'm on.

117
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:19.929
But why would Ebara-san--

118
00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:22.389
It was just an accident.

119
00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:23.679
An accident?

120
00:08:23.989 --> 00:08:27.649
Yes. He fell off the veranda
trying to scare you all.

121
00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:33.359
At any rate,
the Night Baron has died.

122
00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:35.489
Now the tour is over.

123
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.659
Huh?

124
00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.449
Weird. What's with this necktie?

125
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.699
Look at the knot.

126
00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:48.629
The knot?

127
00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:52.919
It's backwards!

128
00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:53.939
But this could be normal for him.

129
00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:55.379
A waitress gave it to me.
But this could be normal for him.

130
00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:55.819
A waitress gave it to me.

131
00:08:55.819 --> 00:08:58.339
I have a necktie of his.
A waitress gave it to me.

132
00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:58.659
A waitress gave it to me.

133
00:08:58.659 --> 00:08:59.209
Here.
A waitress gave it to me.

134
00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:01.029
A waitress gave it to me.

135
00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:03.029
Where'd you get that?
A waitress gave it to me.

136
00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.699
A waitress gave it to me.

137
00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:07.559
She said he forgot it.

138
00:09:08.109 --> 00:09:11.199
It's true! This tie's knot is normal!

139
00:09:11.199 --> 00:09:12.139
Huh?

140
00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:13.479
Huh?! Is there something else?!

141
00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:16.609
He's wearing his belt weird, too.

142
00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:18.859
See? It's upside-down.

143
00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.909
He's not good
with accessories, is he?

144
00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:24.539
This is too unusual, Mori-san.

145
00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:27.449
Yeah. He didn't put these clothes on.

146
00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:28.869
Someone put them on him!

147
00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:34.239
Which means Ebara-san
was pushed off the 21st floor

148
00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:36.129
by the real Night Baron.

149
00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:41.589
In other words, the homicidal
Night Baron is still among us!

150
00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:50.769
It appears we must
ask where each of you were

151
00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:53.729
when Ebara-san fell at 10:00 pm.

152
00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:58.359
Go to the front desk and ask them
to prepare a room for questioning.

153
00:09:58.359 --> 00:09:59.109
Yes, sir!

154
00:09:59.109 --> 00:10:01.359
What should we do with
the body and the costume?

155
00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.489
Good question.

156
00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:07.579
Let's set him in the office until
we're done with the questioning.

157
00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:08.659
Understood.

158
00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:10.659
Interrogation Room -
Authorized Personnel Only

159
00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:11.499
I see.
Interrogation Room -
Authorized Personnel Only

160
00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:15.959
So you were in the observation
lounge with Ran and Conan?

161
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:16.199
Maeda Satoru (30)

162
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.819
Yes. It was some time after
Maeda Satoru (30)

163
00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:19.669
10:00 that I left them.
Maeda Satoru (30)

164
00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:20.929
10:00 that I left them.

165
00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:22.889
It's the truth, Dad!

166
00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:26.849
But you were the one
who looked at the time, right?

167
00:10:28.359 --> 00:10:29.309
Yeah...

168
00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:32.819
Alright. Call in the next person.

169
00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:33.179
My alibi is airtight!

170
00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:35.489
Kamijo Hideko (29)
My alibi is airtight!

171
00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:37.139
After all, I was in the pub
with this man the whole time!
Kamijo Hideko (29)

172
00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:40.569
After all, I was in the pub
with this man the whole time!

173
00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:42.569
Right, Mr. Detective?

174
00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:44.369
Y-Yeah!

175
00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:49.289
But didn't he get dead-drunk?

176
00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:51.909
Yeah, but...

177
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:53.659
Okay. Next!

178
00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:54.029
We were in an open-air restaurant

179
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.949
Kaneshiro Gen'ichiro (74)
We were in an open-air restaurant

180
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:57.609
near where Ebara-san fell.
Kaneshiro Gen'ichiro (74)

181
00:10:57.609 --> 00:10:58.659
near where Ebara-san fell.

182
00:10:58.659 --> 00:10:58.979
lsn't that right, Shizue-san?

183
00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:00.119
Hayashi Shizue (56)
lsn't that right, Shizue-san?

184
00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:01.629
Yes, sir.
Hayashi Shizue (56)

185
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:03.839
Can anyone vouch for this?

186
00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:10.769
It was such a commotion that
I'm unsure people would remember us.

187
00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:16.189
But with the way he died,
I can't say I blame them.

188
00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:20.189
Bring in the next one!

189
00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:23.229
I was in my room reading my

190
00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:23.529
Konno Shiro (28)
I was in my room reading my

191
00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:26.939
e-mail from 9:45 until after 10:00.
Konno Shiro (28)

192
00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:27.829
e-mail from 9:45 until after 10:00.

193
00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:31.859
The hotel's records should prove that.

194
00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:34.789
But you didn't speak
with anyone, correct?

195
00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:39.209
Oh, but I did. With my computer.

196
00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:41.199
Yikes!

197
00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:43.609
Call in the next person.

198
00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:45.989
You were alone in your room, too?

199
00:11:45.989 --> 00:11:46.229
Yes.

200
00:11:46.229 --> 00:11:47.279
Sayama Akiko (24)
Yes.

201
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.509
I was watching TV alone until
Sayama Akiko (24)

202
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.949
Satoru returned after 10:00.

203
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:55.479
So I take it you have
nobody to vouch for you?

204
00:11:55.909 --> 00:11:59.159
I can describe what the
movie was about, though...

205
00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:01.049
There was a bomb in a skyscraper--

206
00:12:01.049 --> 00:12:04.359
Nope. That won't work as proof.

207
00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:13.829
I can't believe they
made me guard him alone!

208
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.789
I hope they finish
their questioning soon!

209
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:21.819
That detective and
your father really tick me off!

210
00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:24.159
I bet they think I did it!

211
00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.259
That's not true!

212
00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:28.849
There's tons of
other suspicious people!

213
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.069
Indeed...

214
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:34.229
Is my shift over?

215
00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:35.669
Yeah? Huh?

216
00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.479
Everyone on the
tour has a flimsy alibi.

217
00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:48.359
Did you maybe order room
service when you were in your room?

218
00:12:48.359 --> 00:12:50.829
I would've already said so if I had.

219
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:56.749
How did the killer leave after
pushing Ebara-san off his veranda?

220
00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:01.199
The room had its security lock set!

221
00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:06.779
All we know is that
the killer is still in the hotel...

222
00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:10.139
You called the front desk?!

223
00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:13.099
Yes. I asked for a wake-up call.

224
00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:14.059
When was that?!

225
00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:16.389
About 10:00, I think...

226
00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:20.609
The hotel keeps records of
when calls are made from rooms!

227
00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:24.279
That means your alibi is--

228
00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:27.359
That's great, Akiko-san!

229
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:35.849
The Night Baron!

230
00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:43.542
The Night Baron!

231
00:13:45.652 --> 00:13:46.292
No way!

232
00:13:47.652 --> 00:13:48.372
Stand back!

233
00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:03.012
Stop!

234
00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.432
What're you doing?!
He's getting away! Ran-neechan!

235
00:14:06.772 --> 00:14:08.102
Ran-neechan!

236
00:14:08.102 --> 00:14:10.062
What?! He showed up?!
Interrogation Room

237
00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:13.442
Why the heck didn't you catch him?!

238
00:14:13.442 --> 00:14:15.832
Sorry! I was in shock!

239
00:14:15.832 --> 00:14:17.442
Detective Yokomizo!

240
00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:18.812
What happened?

241
00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:21.152
He was collapsed in
the room with the body!

242
00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.162
It appears he was hit by someone!

243
00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:25.162
Eh?! And the body?!

244
00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:29.122
It's fine, but the
Night Baron costume is gone!

245
00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:31.162
The Night Baron costume?!

246
00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:31.922
Mori-san...

247
00:14:31.922 --> 00:14:32.882
Detective Yokomizo!

248
00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:33.842
What is it?!

249
00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:35.802
The Night Baron's in the pool!

250
00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:36.552
What?!

251
00:14:39.902 --> 00:14:42.852
The mask, hat, wig, and cape!

252
00:14:42.852 --> 00:14:45.782
So what about the person wearing it?!

253
00:14:45.782 --> 00:14:47.312
Where could they be?

254
00:14:48.152 --> 00:14:51.732
Probably up there.
They tossed it from that balcony.

255
00:14:52.312 --> 00:14:55.192
Why did the killer
show up at the elevators?

256
00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:59.652
If they needed to go up, they
would've used the stairs to go unseen.

257
00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:03.442
And why did they
have to wear the costume,

258
00:15:03.442 --> 00:15:06.122
not to mention risk being
caught trying to steal it?!

259
00:15:06.652 --> 00:15:08.352
His methods are too aggressive!

260
00:15:08.352 --> 00:15:11.652
Could these latest things
have been unplanned?!

261
00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:14.312
Okay! We need to re-question them!

262
00:15:14.312 --> 00:15:16.132
Round up all the suspects!

263
00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:16.842
Yes, sir!

264
00:15:17.772 --> 00:15:21.802
You were all in your rooms,
and you have no witnesses!

265
00:15:22.152 --> 00:15:24.482
Which means none
of you have alibis for when

266
00:15:24.482 --> 00:15:28.122
Sayama-san and the
others were attacked! Correct?

267
00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:30.142
Hold on, Detective.

268
00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:35.982
You told us not to leave our rooms,
and that's just what we did!

269
00:15:35.982 --> 00:15:39.022
Yes. We only did as you asked.

270
00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:42.482
We're not stupid enough
to ignore the police.

271
00:15:42.482 --> 00:15:43.662
That's right.

272
00:15:44.312 --> 00:15:47.022
Akiko-san and Maeda-san
share the same room.

273
00:15:47.022 --> 00:15:49.122
You didn't check if
they were there or not?

274
00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:51.022
There was no time to!

275
00:15:51.022 --> 00:15:55.312
We all came right away to
report about the Night Baron!

276
00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:55.632
Right?

277
00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:57.842
Yeah.

278
00:15:58.232 --> 00:16:01.942
At any rate, we'll need
to check all your rooms.

279
00:16:01.942 --> 00:16:03.962
Yours first, Maeda-san. That alright?

280
00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:04.592
Yes.

281
00:16:08.512 --> 00:16:11.982
Nothing seems out
of the ordinary-- What the...

282
00:16:12.522 --> 00:16:13.962
What's the big idea?!

283
00:16:13.962 --> 00:16:15.152
Just letting some air in!

284
00:16:16.522 --> 00:16:19.152
That stupid kid!

285
00:16:19.522 --> 00:16:22.072
Just to be sure,
please empty your pockets.

286
00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:24.912
I have this room's
layout figured out.

287
00:16:25.522 --> 00:16:28.372
Ebara-san fell
from that veranda...

288
00:16:28.372 --> 00:16:33.312
Yes. The killer dressed
him up as the Night Baron

289
00:16:33.312 --> 00:16:35.542
and pushed him off to
make it look like an accident!

290
00:16:36.942 --> 00:16:40.802
But the security lock was
set in the room where it happened!

291
00:16:41.352 --> 00:16:45.762
In other words, the killer didn't
leave through the door afterward.

292
00:16:46.152 --> 00:16:48.762
Meaning this was a locked-room murder!

293
00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:53.692
The veranda is the only
other way out of the room...

294
00:16:53.692 --> 00:16:56.732
But going from there
into this room is impossible.

295
00:16:56.732 --> 00:16:59.162
Huh? What's this medicine?

296
00:16:59.162 --> 00:17:01.352
Ordinary sleeping pills.

297
00:17:01.352 --> 00:17:04.852
I always carry them with me
for my insomnia. That a problem?

298
00:17:04.852 --> 00:17:06.662
Can I see?

299
00:17:06.662 --> 00:17:09.122
Okay, let's go to the next room.

300
00:17:11.692 --> 00:17:15.062
You won't find anything, Detective.

301
00:17:15.062 --> 00:17:16.962
We're just making sure.

302
00:17:18.652 --> 00:17:20.002
Him again!

303
00:17:20.692 --> 00:17:24.232
The veranda he
fell from is directly above...

304
00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:25.972
It might be possible
to climb down here...

305
00:17:25.972 --> 00:17:28.602
Why do you keep following me?!

306
00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:32.522
I thought I'd watch your
great detective skills in action!

307
00:17:32.522 --> 00:17:36.482
Oh, okay!
In that case, pay close attention!

308
00:17:36.902 --> 00:17:39.352
There are no signs
of the window being broken.

309
00:17:39.352 --> 00:17:41.812
Guess he can be cute sometimes!

310
00:17:41.812 --> 00:17:45.242
Was this window always locked, Mister?

311
00:17:46.692 --> 00:17:50.352
My eyes are bad.
Can you answer, Shizue-san?

312
00:17:50.352 --> 00:17:53.742
Of course it was.
I check it each time we leave.

313
00:17:53.742 --> 00:17:57.212
Konno-san's room is next.

314
00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:02.982
I've heard that he was suspected
of using his bank's computers

315
00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:05.422
without permission
and was thus demoted.

316
00:18:06.022 --> 00:18:10.102
He may have wanted to
see the Baron the most of all.

317
00:18:10.102 --> 00:18:11.102
Huh?

318
00:18:11.102 --> 00:18:13.392
It's simply a rumor, though.

319
00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.852
So that old man told you that?

320
00:18:15.852 --> 00:18:17.522
Yes.

321
00:18:17.522 --> 00:18:22.902
Who's he to talk? He's the one
who hates the Night Baron the most.

322
00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:23.772
What do you mean?!

323
00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:30.562
After all, the son he so dutifully
raised was murdered by the virus.

324
00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:34.272
Come to think of it,
he did mention that...

325
00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:37.902
The Night Baron. Hearing
that name brings back memories

326
00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:40.502
of my son who died four years ago...

327
00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:43.692
A virus? His son died of an illness?

328
00:18:43.692 --> 00:18:46.272
What's that have to
do with the Night Baron?!

329
00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:48.052
That's a good question...

330
00:18:48.052 --> 00:18:49.902
Are you playing dumb?!

331
00:18:49.902 --> 00:18:50.922
Mori-san...

332
00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.682
Please stop! I'll give you
some special information!

333
00:18:54.682 --> 00:18:59.642
This is the closest window to the veranda,
but there's no way across.

334
00:18:59.642 --> 00:19:01.442
With Kamijo-san?!

335
00:19:01.442 --> 00:19:03.902
They were married.

336
00:19:04.312 --> 00:19:07.322
Though I hear they
divorced three years ago.

337
00:19:08.562 --> 00:19:12.772
That's right. The late
Ebara Tokio was my husband.

338
00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:17.602
But that was three years ago...
when I learned he was a hacker.

339
00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:18.202
Hacker?

340
00:19:18.942 --> 00:19:22.172
A criminal who steals computer data!

341
00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:26.692
Everyone who uses a
computer loathes hackers!

342
00:19:28.562 --> 00:19:30.472
I'm relieved that he's dead.

343
00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:32.312
Ah, yes.

344
00:19:32.312 --> 00:19:37.812
I believe Sayama Akiko-san's
brother ran a small software company.

345
00:19:37.812 --> 00:19:41.232
Which means she's no exception, either.

346
00:19:41.602 --> 00:19:45.942
Meaning that everyone on
the tour had a reason to kill him.

347
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:47.902
Right, Detective?

348
00:19:49.732 --> 00:19:53.812
Oh? These are the same
pills that Akiko-san had...

349
00:19:53.812 --> 00:19:55.782
Are these also--

350
00:19:56.152 --> 00:19:58.192
Say, what are these pills for?

351
00:19:58.192 --> 00:20:01.562
Hey! Don't touch my things!

352
00:20:01.562 --> 00:20:02.942
Is it cold medicine?

353
00:20:02.942 --> 00:20:04.002
Y-Yes, that's right...

354
00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:06.962
Oh, I thought they were
sleeping pills. Guess not.

355
00:20:08.672 --> 00:20:09.632
Alright, you!

356
00:20:09.902 --> 00:20:14.552
What are you blabbing about now?!
Go get in bed, kid!

357
00:20:16.152 --> 00:20:18.222
I didn't check the room's layout yet!

358
00:20:21.562 --> 00:20:25.652
Ah, well. It's the same layout
as Konno-san's room downstairs.

359
00:20:25.652 --> 00:20:28.982
Well, looking at
everyone's rooms, we get...

360
00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:30.152
Ebara - Room 2101

361
00:20:30.152 --> 00:20:31.152
Ebara - Room 2101
Kamijo - Room 2102

362
00:20:31.152 --> 00:20:32.152
Kaneshiro & Hayashi - Room 2001

363
00:20:32.152 --> 00:20:33.152
Kaneshiro & Hayashi - Room 2001
Konno - Room 2002

364
00:20:33.152 --> 00:20:34.152
Maeda & Sayama - Room 1901

365
00:20:34.152 --> 00:20:34.482
Maeda & Sayama - Room 1901
Body

366
00:20:34.482 --> 00:20:35.952
...as a result.
Maeda & Sayama - Room 1901
Body

367
00:20:35.952 --> 00:20:39.652
So the only possible escape
from Ebara-s an's veranda

368
00:20:39.652 --> 00:20:42.102
was through Kaneshiro-san
and Hayashi-san's room...

369
00:20:42.102 --> 00:20:43.792
What do we do with this?

370
00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:47.252
I'm not sure. It's a piece
of the security lock.

371
00:20:47.252 --> 00:20:50.002
Oh, yeah. Ebara-san's room
is on this floor, too.

372
00:20:50.002 --> 00:20:52.462
Hey, there's something on the tip...

373
00:20:53.102 --> 00:20:54.172
It's cellophane tape!

374
00:20:55.472 --> 00:20:58.442
Wait a minute! Could this be--

375
00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:29.392
He dodged all of my
kicks with no effort at all!

376
00:22:30.352 --> 00:22:36.632
The only suspect who
could've done that was... him!

377
00:22:37.942 --> 00:22:39.322
What should I do?!

378
00:22:40.232 --> 00:22:42.812
Tell me, Shinichi!

379
00:22:42.812 --> 00:22:44.282
Shinichi!

380
00:22:46.562 --> 00:22:48.812
Open up, Ran-neechan!

381
00:22:48.812 --> 00:22:50.162
Conan-kun! What's the matter?

382
00:22:51.442 --> 00:22:53.482
The security lock was set.

383
00:22:53.482 --> 00:22:57.132
That's strange.
I don't remember locking it.

384
00:22:57.132 --> 00:22:58.232
Success!

385
00:22:58.232 --> 00:22:59.592
Huh? Are you crying?

386
00:23:00.102 --> 00:23:02.552
No! Some tears came out when I yawned.

387
00:23:03.762 --> 00:23:05.512
Well, I'm leaving for a bit!

388
00:23:05.512 --> 00:23:06.972
At this time of night?!

389
00:23:06.972 --> 00:23:08.352
I'll be back soon!

390
00:23:09.652 --> 00:23:11.102
Oh, it's you.

391
00:23:11.102 --> 00:23:13.562
You should be asleep, little boy.

392
00:23:13.982 --> 00:23:15.402
Don't worry about it.

393
00:23:15.982 --> 00:23:19.352
Using that trick,
anyone could have killed him!

394
00:23:19.352 --> 00:23:21.812
I'll have to check
each of their alibis...

395
00:23:21.812 --> 00:23:24.442
Hey, you hear about Misawa-san?

396
00:23:24.442 --> 00:23:27.202
About how the killer knocked
him out in the office with the body?

397
00:23:27.482 --> 00:23:30.852
But isn't Misawa-san a karate expert?

398
00:23:30.852 --> 00:23:32.672
Yeah! Best in the department!

399
00:23:33.482 --> 00:23:36.772
Even if he was caught off guard...

400
00:23:36.772 --> 00:23:38.092
Hey, now!

401
00:23:38.692 --> 00:23:40.722
Could the killer be--

402
00:23:45.652 --> 00:23:47.522
Huh? Conan-kun?

403
00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:50.402
Alright, who set the security lock?!

404
00:23:50.402 --> 00:23:52.442
I locked it from the outside!

405
00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:55.702
It locked!

406
00:23:56.532 --> 00:24:00.162
That would seal the room
and make it look like an accident!

407
00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:03.372
I found an alibi for him!

408
00:24:03.952 --> 00:24:04.792
Hold on a second!

409
00:24:05.532 --> 00:24:07.752
There's one place where the wind is--

410
00:24:08.202 --> 00:24:09.642
On the next Conan--

411
00:24:09.642 --> 00:24:13.202
The Night Baron Murder Case (The Solution).

412
00:24:14.597 --> 00:24:16.977
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:18.167
Wind through the buildings.
