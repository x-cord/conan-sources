1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.180
A racing second hand,
a glittering shooting star!

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.250
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.250
Today's case is a bank robbery!
But something's a little off!

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.420
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.390
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.760
His name?

7
00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:38.759
"The Bank Robbery Murder Case."

8
00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:51.019
Wow! A turkey!

9
00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:54.979
That was fun!

10
00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.919
Bowling alleys are nice
and empty on weekdays!

11
00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:58.939
Definitely!

12
00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.779
And it feels great to
be done with midterms!

13
00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.959
You're always feeling great...

14
00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.569
Are you alright, Conan-kun?

15
00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.529
I wonder if you caught a cold...

16
00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.279
You don't seem to have a fever...

17
00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.209
It's early, but maybe we should go home.

18
00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.469
Oh no!

19
00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.289
What's wrong?!

20
00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.119
I forgot to go to the bank!

21
00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.669
The bank?

22
00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:31.119
Yeah, Dad asked me to
cash a check a client wrote him!

23
00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.629
Wasn't there a bank around here?

24
00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.599
Toto Bank is just around... that corner.

25
00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.809
Toto Bank- North Beika
Park Branch Office

26
00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.489
We just made it, Ran-neechan!

27
00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.459
Yeah!

28
00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.769
This shouldn't take too long,
Conan-kun.

29
00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.069
Tsuji Saburo - College Student

30
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.659
Nagai Takashi (60) Bank Manager

31
00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.529
Thank you.
Nagai Takashi (60) Bank Manager

32
00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.329
Looks like the cold's
really going around.

33
00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.469
Hi!

34
00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:06.539
Ebisawa Kazuo (45) Branch Manager

35
00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.959
Sonoko-ojousama! What brings you here today?
Ebisawa Kazuo (45) Branch Manager

36
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.809
I'm just here with a friend...

37
00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:13.879
Is that so?

38
00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.229
Please give your father my regards.

39
00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.649
Hey, Sonoko. Who was that?

40
00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.479
The branch manager here.

41
00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.539
The daughter of the
Suzuki family shows herself!

42
00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.009
Conan-kun...

43
00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.119
Totally sounds like a cold.

44
00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:33.529
You all right, little boy?

45
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.329
Taniguchi Noboru Toto Bank Clerk

46
00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.739
That's a nasty cough. Have some cough drops.
Taniguchi Noboru Toto Bank Clerk

47
00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.199
You can keep them.

48
00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.289
Thanks!

49
00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.579
Thank you!

50
00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.369
Not at all.

51
00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.249
Taniguchi-san! Could you come here?

52
00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.789
Sure!

53
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.619
If you'll excuse me.

54
00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.049
It's this...

55
00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.329
Lemme see.

56
00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.349
Maejima Tetsuya (28) Toto Bank Clerk

57
00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.079
Branch Manager. I'm going
to make my rounds now.

58
00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.609
Right. Go get 'em!

59
00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.659
Everyone,
stand up with your hands up!

60
00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:27.499
Okay! Do anything
funny and you're dead!

61
00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:29.119
Move!

62
00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:30.789
You deaf or something?!

63
00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:36.499
This goin' to one of your clients?!

64
00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.719
The world's so unfair!

65
00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.579
You, there!

66
00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:44.709
Yeah, you! Fill this up!

67
00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.159
The rest, out from behind the counter!

68
00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:58.659
Alright! Everyone stay where you are!

69
00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.009
Now fill the bag!

70
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.809
Ran! What do we do?!

71
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.049
We'll be fine if we just stand here.

72
00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:54.209
Oh no!

73
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:56.419
What the--

74
00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.719
S-S-Shut up!

75
00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:08.119
Be quiet! Quiet, I say!

76
00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.539
Shut up!

77
00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:15.059
Conan-kun!

78
00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:43.299
Maejima-san's bullet wound
was serious, but not life-threatening.

79
00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:54.369
So, when Maejima-san went to
hit the robber with the wooden sword,

80
00:06:54.369 --> 00:07:00.399
this cell phone in his pocket went off?

81
00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:07.119
That's right. Then the robber
turned around, saw him, and fired!

82
00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:12.539
And immediately after, you jumped
on the robber, Taniguchi-san?

83
00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:18.159
I saw Maejima get shot and
then the women started screaming,

84
00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.999
so I panicked.

85
00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.419
The robber did too, so he
pointed the gun at the women...

86
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:28.119
The moment things looked bad, I just--

87
00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:32.999
My only focus was on
pointing the gun elsewhere...

88
00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.229
Then that happened...

89
00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:39.539
Inspector Megure.

90
00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:43.779
We're done examining,
so you can come back now.

91
00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:46.739
Please wait here a moment.

92
00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:50.159
The gun was a modified model gun.

93
00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:55.369
And this corner wasn't
recorded by the security camera.

94
00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:05.049
The robber had a cell phone, too...

95
00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:07.249
Inspector.

96
00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:11.409
Saeki Tohru. Born in 1970.

97
00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:13.559
Understood.

98
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:19.089
Does anyone here recognize the robber?

99
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.919
Whoops.

100
00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:29.109
Oh, it wasn't me.

101
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:34.289
It's Maejima-san's cell phone.

102
00:08:34.499 --> 00:08:35.749
Huh?

103
00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:43.119
Hello, this is Police Inspector Megure.
May I ask who's calling?

104
00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:43.919
Koike-san?

105
00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:46.629
Maejima-san's client.

106
00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:52.619
Actually, Maejima-san
was injured during an incident.

107
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:57.429
Pardon my asking, but did
you call this phone at around 3:05?

108
00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:00.559
You didn't?

109
00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:03.149
I see.

110
00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:08.159
Hey! Let me listen, too!

111
00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.699
You recorded during the robbery, right?

112
00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:17.659
Not so loud! I'm gonna sell
this to the media later for a lot!

113
00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.139
In that case...

114
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:22.539
Fine.

115
00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:27.589
Don't move!
Stay right where you are!

116
00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:35.119
I thought so!

117
00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.159
That's enough!

118
00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:42.829
We have some idea
about the situation now.

119
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:44.309
Detective!

120
00:09:44.749 --> 00:09:47.279
Will Taniguchi be
blamed for what he did?

121
00:09:47.619 --> 00:09:48.539
Certainly not!

122
00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:54.789
Had he not jumped at the robber,
you folks might've been shot!

123
00:09:54.789 --> 00:10:00.329
He acted courageously
and risked his own life!

124
00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:03.419
If anything, he should be rewarded!

125
00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:07.089
Is that so?!
That's great news, Taniguchi!

126
00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:10.709
We owe you a reward, as well!

127
00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:11.959
No...

128
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:16.619
Maejima-san was unlucky, though.

129
00:10:16.619 --> 00:10:20.329
We still don't know who called him.

130
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:28.019
If his phone hadn't rung just then,
he might never have been shot...

131
00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:31.779
No! Everyone's got it all wrong!

132
00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:41.829
Here it is!

133
00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:55.009
This isn't a toy, little boy.
It's important.

134
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:58.719
Taniguchi-san.
I'll be filing the report,

135
00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:01.909
so could you accompany
me to the station?

136
00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:03.209
All right.

137
00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:06.359
I need to use the restroom first.

138
00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:07.149
Sure thing.

139
00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:22.619
What is it, little boy?

140
00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:23.409
Need the restroom?

141
00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:24.539
Yeah...

142
00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:25.519
Oh...

143
00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:32.669
Why did Taniguchi-san
get nervous and hide his phone?

144
00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:36.429
Was he trying to call somewhere? Or--

145
00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:40.889
Could there be
another side to this case?!

146
00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:44.959
To think you kids were involved, too...

147
00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.939
It's a miracle you weren't hurt!

148
00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:54.899
A card-based security lock.

149
00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:02.239
Taniguchi-san's jacket!

150
00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:04.659
Come to think of it...

151
00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:07.579
what was the robber looking for?

152
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:11.669
Cigarettes? A lighter? I doubt it...

153
00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:12.889
Then what, exactly?

154
00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:19.459
Empty...

155
00:12:20.789 --> 00:12:22.969
Wait! Before that, he--

156
00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:31.309
It was right around here...

157
00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.069
This is...

158
00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.009
I've figured it out!

159
00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:53.409
So, this case does
have a more sinister side!

160
00:13:05.282 --> 00:13:09.722
The old man's not here today,
so I'll have to rely on Sonoko again!

161
00:13:10.492 --> 00:13:12.202
Sorry to keep you waiting.

162
00:13:12.202 --> 00:13:16.312
I'm sorry to burden
you after all that's happened...

163
00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:17.272
Say, Ran!

164
00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:21.702
What is it, Sonoko? Sonoko?

165
00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:23.362
Not again...

166
00:13:25.652 --> 00:13:26.902
Sonoko!

167
00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:29.112
Inspector, I've figured it out.

168
00:13:30.372 --> 00:13:33.072
Figured what out, Sonoko-kun?

169
00:13:33.072 --> 00:13:37.042
There's a sinister
side to this thingy, err, dealy!

170
00:13:37.322 --> 00:13:40.032
"Thingy, err, dealy"?

171
00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:41.502
I mean incident!

172
00:13:41.782 --> 00:13:45.952
Boy, it's hard to talk like a girl!

173
00:13:45.952 --> 00:13:51.432
To begin with, what rang when
Maejima-san went to use the sword

174
00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:55.892
was not his phone, but the robber's!

175
00:13:55.892 --> 00:14:01.852
Impossible! Everyone's confirmed
that it was his phone that rang!

176
00:14:01.852 --> 00:14:05.402
But when his cell phone rang earlier,

177
00:14:05.402 --> 00:14:10.032
both you and Taniguchi-san
mistakenly grabbed your own phones!

178
00:14:10.032 --> 00:14:16.322
Similarly, everyone thought it
was Maejima-san's phone that rang!

179
00:14:18.612 --> 00:14:25.282
That is possible, but how are you
sure it was the robber's phone instead?

180
00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:26.552
The ringtone.

181
00:14:26.552 --> 00:14:27.842
The ringtone?

182
00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:35.242
Compare the ringtones of
the two phones and you'll see.

183
00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:40.682
Also, that college guy has the
ringtone from the robbery on tape!

184
00:14:41.682 --> 00:14:44.562
Is this true? Do you have this?!

185
00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:46.132
No!

186
00:14:46.132 --> 00:14:47.702
Quit yer lyin'!

187
00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:51.072
I did it again!

188
00:14:51.072 --> 00:14:55.122
I mean, don't bother lying!
I know you do!

189
00:14:55.652 --> 00:15:00.532
Well?! Help us out if you have it!

190
00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:04.042
Okay, okay... but give it back later!

191
00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:08.002
Inspector! I got a tape player!

192
00:15:09.302 --> 00:15:11.262
Maejima

193
00:15:11.262 --> 00:15:12.632
Bank Robber

194
00:15:12.632 --> 00:15:14.222
Alright, let's begin.

195
00:15:14.222 --> 00:15:15.742
Please.

196
00:15:15.742 --> 00:15:18.572
First, Maejima-san's cell phone.

197
00:15:20.862 --> 00:15:24.702
Next, the robber's cell phone.

198
00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:31.202
It's the same sound,
but a different pattern...

199
00:15:31.202 --> 00:15:32.992
And here's the one
during the incident...

200
00:15:33.952 --> 00:15:36.072
Shut up! Shut up!

201
00:15:36.072 --> 00:15:37.662
A little before that!

202
00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:39.452
Right!

203
00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:47.672
Go back again!

204
00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:48.502
Yes, sir!

205
00:15:55.612 --> 00:15:59.892
That's definitely the ringtone
from the robber's cell phone.

206
00:16:00.532 --> 00:16:02.822
Sonoko-kun. Just as you said,

207
00:16:02.822 --> 00:16:07.532
it seems it was the
robber's phone that rang.

208
00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:12.862
Did someone just happen
to call his phone then, or--

209
00:16:12.862 --> 00:16:15.822
It was likely his accomplice who called.

210
00:16:16.282 --> 00:16:17.782
Accomplice?!

211
00:16:18.362 --> 00:16:22.742
That accomplice saw Maejima-san
about to hit him with the sword,

212
00:16:23.612 --> 00:16:28.882
and quickly called the
robber's phone using his own...

213
00:16:28.882 --> 00:16:30.742
to warn him of the danger!

214
00:16:30.742 --> 00:16:36.342
What?! Then that means
his accomplice is still in here!

215
00:16:39.072 --> 00:16:43.612
Yes. And that would be you,
Taniguchi-san!

216
00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:48.902
You can't be serious.
Don't joke like that.

217
00:16:49.282 --> 00:16:50.492
Taniguchi-san.

218
00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:54.822
First, you used your cell phone
to signal the robber outside

219
00:16:55.402 --> 00:16:57.612
to bust inside at just the right time.

220
00:16:57.612 --> 00:17:03.862
Because the staff door opens
from the inside when someone leaves,

221
00:17:03.862 --> 00:17:06.702
but you need a card
to get in from the outside!

222
00:17:10.782 --> 00:17:13.542
Branch Manager. I'm going
to make my rounds now.

223
00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:14.962
Right, that's it.

224
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:21.202
Hold on a sec while I get the list.

225
00:17:21.202 --> 00:17:22.392
Alright.

226
00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:32.862
Everyone stand
up with your hands up!

227
00:17:32.862 --> 00:17:38.322
Then, as planned, you filled
the bag with cash as he ordered,

228
00:17:38.902 --> 00:17:42.072
and were the only
one left behind the counter.

229
00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:46.742
Looking back, he barely
seemed concerned about you!

230
00:17:46.742 --> 00:17:50.672
Your original plan had him
leaving without hurting anyone

231
00:17:50.672 --> 00:17:54.632
and making off
with the money-filled bag!

232
00:17:54.632 --> 00:17:58.532
Then, you'd meet up with
him later to split the money!

233
00:17:59.782 --> 00:18:03.802
But something unexpected happened!

234
00:18:04.742 --> 00:18:07.852
Maejima-san regained consciousness!

235
00:18:16.782 --> 00:18:19.742
You wanted to warn him somehow.

236
00:18:20.612 --> 00:18:23.202
You probably wanted to shout, "Behind you!"

237
00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.112
but that would've exposed you.

238
00:18:26.112 --> 00:18:28.492
Thinking quickly...

239
00:18:28.492 --> 00:18:31.542
...you pressed your redial button.

240
00:18:32.322 --> 00:18:37.592
The robber's phone rang,
but Maejima-san thought it was his own

241
00:18:37.592 --> 00:18:39.962
and was shot when he froze!

242
00:18:44.612 --> 00:18:50.312
The biggest mistake, in your eyes,
was when he shot him.

243
00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:55.282
The robber lost his cool and
looked ready to shoot other people.

244
00:18:55.282 --> 00:18:58.902
Realizing that the plan was
out of control, you jumped at him...

245
00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:08.622
...and shut him up by pretending
to shoot him during the struggle!

246
00:19:08.622 --> 00:19:11.582
This is nonsense!
She's just making this up!

247
00:19:13.202 --> 00:19:15.862
Could I see your cell phone?

248
00:19:15.862 --> 00:19:22.472
If she's right, the redial button
should call the robber's phone.

249
00:19:22.952 --> 00:19:24.022
Certainly.

250
00:19:24.022 --> 00:19:25.302
I thought so!

251
00:19:25.652 --> 00:19:30.432
You erased your redial memory
when you went to the restroom!

252
00:19:30.862 --> 00:19:34.612
Inspector. There's definitive
proof that they were accomplices.

253
00:19:34.612 --> 00:19:36.402
Are you serious, Sonoko-kun?!

254
00:19:36.402 --> 00:19:37.952
Conan-kun.

255
00:19:37.952 --> 00:19:39.072
Right!

256
00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:43.952
Inspector. Put your hands out.

257
00:19:44.992 --> 00:19:46.622
Like this?

258
00:19:46.622 --> 00:19:47.152
Here you go!

259
00:19:49.072 --> 00:19:50.582
What is this?

260
00:19:50.952 --> 00:19:55.542
Cough drops! I got them from
Taniguchi-san before the robbery!

261
00:19:57.612 --> 00:20:00.072
Sonoko-neechan! I handed them over!

262
00:20:00.072 --> 00:20:03.572
Inspector. In your right hand
is paper the robber threw away.

263
00:20:03.572 --> 00:20:08.142
Right afterwards, he fumbled around
in Taniguchi-san's jacket pockets!

264
00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:11.602
He was looking for cough drops.

265
00:20:11.952 --> 00:20:16.322
He and Taniguchi-san probably
met somewhere this afternoon

266
00:20:16.322 --> 00:20:19.062
for a final meeting.

267
00:20:19.062 --> 00:20:21.742
Both had colds and sore throats,

268
00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:27.072
so one of them split a pack of
cough drops and gave half to the other.

269
00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:31.612
Afterwards, the robber's throat
hurt again after shouting

270
00:20:31.612 --> 00:20:36.072
so, he went to get a cough drop from
his pocket, but they were all gone

271
00:20:36.072 --> 00:20:38.622
and only the wrapper remained.

272
00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:44.072
Then, he remembered Taniguchi-san
had some in his jacket pocket

273
00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:45.742
and went to get them...

274
00:20:45.742 --> 00:20:49.092
...unaware he had given
them away to Conan-kun.

275
00:20:49.702 --> 00:20:54.532
As proof, the tears on the
wrappers should fit perfectly!

276
00:20:56.402 --> 00:20:57.562
You're right!

277
00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:06.072
Also, fingerprints from Taniguchi-san
or the robber should be on both!

278
00:21:06.452 --> 00:21:08.482
Have them checked at once.

279
00:21:08.482 --> 00:21:09.902
Yes, sir!

280
00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:13.082
Taniguchi-san.
Do you have anything to say?

281
00:21:15.952 --> 00:21:18.332
Saeki gave me the cough drops.

282
00:21:19.782 --> 00:21:22.242
I met him through a loan shark.

283
00:21:22.242 --> 00:21:27.012
We came up with this robbery to
repay the loan and for play money.

284
00:21:28.992 --> 00:21:30.952
Had I known this would happen,

285
00:21:30.952 --> 00:21:34.612
I wouldn't have
given you the cough drops.

286
00:23:10.452 --> 00:23:15.072
You're incredible, Sonoko!
You solved another case!

287
00:23:15.072 --> 00:23:19.862
I don't remember much,
but I felt this sharp pinprick--

288
00:23:19.862 --> 00:23:20.952
Yikes!
Pinprick?

289
00:23:20.952 --> 00:23:23.782
But Shinichi-kun has nothing on me!

290
00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:30.052
It's all about the cute and charming
high school detective Suzuki Sonoko!

291
00:23:33.452 --> 00:23:37.362
Darn it! I knew
I shouldn't have used her!

292
00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.562
Such regrets...

293
00:23:45.192 --> 00:23:49.362
I got it! It's all mine--

294
00:23:49.362 --> 00:23:50.862
You OK, Genta?

295
00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:53.072
What the...

296
00:23:54.822 --> 00:23:57.162
He was strangled with string or something!

297
00:23:57.162 --> 00:23:59.162
He was murdered?!

298
00:24:00.822 --> 00:24:03.462
This was no mugging!

299
00:24:03.702 --> 00:24:05.002
She's the killer!

300
00:24:05.992 --> 00:24:07.582
But I have no proof!

301
00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:09.862
On the next Conan:

302
00:24:09.862 --> 00:24:12.512
"The Hobo Artist Murder Case."
