1
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,352
"Ms. Masudo's Dressing Room"

2
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:34,452
How is it?

3
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:37,152
Well...

4
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:42,052
Is there anybody that you do not know?

5
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:46,952
Is there?

6
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,252
Yes.

7
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,752
I have never seen that person.

8
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:54,352
The man with tanned skin, brown hair and sunglasses.

9
00:00:56,152 --> 00:01:00,752
And also that skinny man with bobbed hair.

10
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:05,152
And the man with the beard and glasses.

11
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,552
That's all.

12
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:11,152
I think the last guy is the most suspicious one.

13
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:14,052
Huh? Why do you say so, Ran?

14
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:17,452
Because he was taking pictures of a lot of people

15
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,052
saying that they looked like his friend or something like that.

16
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:25,452
Then he could be my uncle, Uncle Gunji, because he's a photographer.

17
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:31,452
But you don't know what he looks like, right?

18
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,752
No.

19
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:36,052
He used to play with me when I was little.

20
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:40,752
Back then, he was much skinnier and had no beard.

21
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,952
But since he started working internationally as a photographer,

22
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:46,152
I haven't seen him at all.

23
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:48,652
Then what about the other two?

24
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,552
Especially that guy who doesn't take off his sunglasses

25
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,552
even inside the building.

26
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,852
Maybe he is my instructor, Mr. Shimabukuro,

27
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,252
who gave me snowboarding lessons before.

28
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:04,552
I met Masateru at his snowboarding lesson.

29
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:05,752
That's why we invited him.

30
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,952
I see.

31
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:12,052
I quit snowboarding already though.

32
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:13,252
I think I couldn't recognize him

33
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:16,852
is because his face was always covered with goggles and a hat.

34
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:21,052
I understand.

35
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:23,752
Then what about the man with bobbed hair?

36
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:26,452
All I can think of right now

37
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:29,052
is that he is the administrator of the hot spring website.

38
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,652
His name is Mr. Karube, I think.

39
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,652
A hot spring website?

40
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,752
Administrator?

41
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:40,052
Inspector, internet sites have administrators.

42
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,852
Of course I know that!

43
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:46,352
He is very shy that he didn't want to come to a party we had before.

44
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:50,352
We talked to him and finally convinced him to attend our wedding,

45
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,552
so this is the first time we actually got to see him.

46
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:56,352
But that person seemed to know who you were.

47
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:59,552
He talked to Officer Yumi who was pretending to be you.

48
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:03,252
A few days ago, I sent him a summer gift with my picture in it,

49
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:05,352
so he should know how I look like.

50
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,152
Inspector.

51
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:11,552
I think we have to call them out, get their fingerprints

52
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:14,452
and see if it matches the serial killer's fingerprint.

53
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,152
No.

54
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,752
They came here for our wedding. We can't do that!

55
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:23,152
But there's no other way to find the killer.

56
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:27,752
Hey, how did you figure out that it was the bad man's fingerprints?

57
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:32,452
The criminal is a suspect of four different homicide cases

58
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:36,652
and his fingerprints were found from one of the murder scenes.

59
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:40,952
We found it on the earring the victim was wearing.

60
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:44,452
There was a piece of gloves on the victim's teeth.

61
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:47,952
Which tells us that the killer put his left hand on the victim's mouth

62
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:50,452
and stabbed the throat but the victim struggled and bit off the gloves.

63
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,852
The killer then tried to silence the victim with his bare left hand

64
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:54,552
and that was when he touched her earring.

65
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:58,752
We found the same fingerprints on the cooking knife

66
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,752
that the killer left at Ms. Rei's house.

67
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:02,352
Not only we got the fingerprints,

68
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,352
but we also got the pattern of his left palm on the knife.

69
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:05,752
That's how we found

70
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:09,552
the fingerprints on the earring was from the killer's left ring finger.

71
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,852
Inspector, then the killer wasn't wearing gloves

72
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,852
when he broke into Ms. Masudo's house?

73
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,452
No, I heard he was wearing gloves.

74
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:19,652
Maybe he grabbed the cooking knife with his bare hand before he broke in.

75
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:21,352
The killer didn't leave any of his murder weapons behind

76
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:24,252
in the first four cases.

77
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:27,752
I guess he didn't think that he would be chased off by Mr. Taira.

78
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,752
So he panicked and forgot to wipe off his fingerprints.

79
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:34,052
Yeah, since no fingerprints were found other than on the cooking knife.

80
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:37,052
Let me ask you, Mr. Taira.

81
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,652
Was the front door locked when you came to save Ms. Masudo?

82
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:42,452
No. It was not locked.

83
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,352
That's because

84
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,752
the house was totally dark,

85
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,852
so I was groping around searching for the front door.

86
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:50,352
Then I found the door and opened it.

87
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,352
Is there anything wrong?

88
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:57,552
No. Actually, I think I saw something.

89
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,952
What was it? Tell me.

90
00:04:58,952 --> 00:05:00,652
Please remember.

91
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:04,252
Excuse me, this is not a place for interrogation.

92
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,252
Huh?

93
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,552
What is it, Ran?

94
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:09,952
Look at those three men.

95
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:14,652
The bobbed hair guy has a bandage on his left pinky and ring finger.

96
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:19,852
The bearded guy with glasses has a Band-Aid on his ring finger.

97
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,952
And the one with sunglasses is keeping his left hand

98
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:24,452
in his pocket all the time.

99
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:29,152
They may be trying to avoid leaving their fingerprints anywhere.

100
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:31,852
All right then.

101
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:35,052
Why don't you call them and get their fingerprints or whatever?

102
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:38,752
It will prove whether the killer is here or not.

103
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:42,152
I don't think any of our guests is a criminal though!

104
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:47,552
But Conan is already out there asking around right now.

105
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,552
What? Why is that brat always like that?

106
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:56,352
Mouri.

107
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:58,552
Now what?

108
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:01,452
So what happened to their left hand?

109
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,452
The man who had a bandage on said

110
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:05,352
he sprained his ring finger when he was playing baseball.

111
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,652
The one with Band-Aid slammed his hand with the door of his house.

112
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,852
The guy with his hand in his pocket said it's just his habit.

113
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:17,752
That's right, he's wearing sunglasses indoors to hide a stye on his eye.

114
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,752
Oh, I remember it now!

115
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:23,352
I saw it.

116
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:26,952
I saw it when Masateru came to save me.

117
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,352
It was...

118
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,652
It was a stye that I saw on his right eye!

119
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,252
What?

120
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:36,752
A stye?

121
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:41,552
Then the man with sunglasses is the serial killer?

122
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:45,152
But stye usually disappears within a week.

123
00:06:58,352 --> 00:06:59,852
A stye.

124
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:04,652
Now I know who the serial killer is.

125
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:15,775
What?

126
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:19,775
You're telling me maybe the serial killer is here already?

127
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,175
In this wedding ceremony hall?

128
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,275
Yes.

129
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,375
He killed one of the guests in order to get the invitation,

130
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,475
so he can get in here.

131
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,775
You guys are the scapegoat for the bride and groom,

132
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,475
you have to be careful.

133
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,775
In fact, I have some other ideas about the suspect as well.

134
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:39,275
What? Other ideas?

135
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,375
-What is it? Is there someone else you can think of? -Hey, Yumi.

136
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,875
I need you to do me a favour.

137
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,675
What is it?

138
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:48,075
Sorry. Takagi, could you leave us for a moment?

139
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,975
It's girl's talk, you know.

140
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,375
Oh, okay!

141
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,275
I'll go to the washroom. No, I just went to washroom a while ago.

142
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,675
Anyway, I'm going again.

143
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:10,575
Of course.

144
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,675
I knew it was going to be like this.

145
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,575
So I brought this.

146
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,375
See?

147
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,975
Thanks, Yumi.

148
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:32,275
We can't just judge who the killer is by his face.

149
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:35,675
Well, Ms. Masudo is not sure who those three guys are,

150
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:38,075
so we should take their fingerprints

151
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:41,875
and see if it matches the killer's before the wedding starts.

152
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,075
Please, you cannot do that.

153
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,275
What if nothing's found?

154
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,775
What if they're all innocent?

155
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,175
I understand,

156
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,475
but the only information we have about the criminal

157
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:54,775
is the fact that he had a stye on his right eye.

158
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:57,575
But that information can't prove anything

159
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,675
because his stye must have healed since it was six months ago.

160
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:02,675
Don't you remember his voice?

161
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,575
You heard him saying "I will never forgive you", right?

162
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:10,575
Yeah. But he was wearing a mask so his voice wasn't that clear.

163
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,575
If the voice left an impression,

164
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,575
we would've told you six months ago.

165
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:16,675
Inspector Megure.

166
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:20,075
The hall staff is saying that we should start the ceremony soon.

167
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,075
I understand. Let's start then.

168
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,675
-Hey, hey! -We'll be there soon!

169
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:25,775
Wait!

170
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,175
Hey, you...

171
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,175
Let's go.

172
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,075
Mr. Taira.

173
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,075
Mr. Taira!

174
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:40,275
Regardless, the wedding is still going on no matter what happens.

175
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,475
If you guys are still worried, why don't you guys attend our ceremony

176
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,975
and check what's going on?

177
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:49,275
I really don't expect the killer to show anyway.

178
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,675
Hey, Mr. Taira!

179
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,975
Just leave him now.

180
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,675
Let him do whatever he wants to do.

181
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,875
You know we cannot do that.

182
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,675
Now, I'll tell you what I think about this case,

183
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:04,275
but it is up to you whether you believe it or not.

184
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,575
Okay, Inspector Megure?

185
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,075
It is up to you.

186
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:24,075
Huh? How come nobody is around?

187
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,675
It's Takagi! I'm coming in!

188
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:33,075
I'm coming in.

189
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,475
What? No way!

190
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,375
No one's here.

191
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,375
What is this?

192
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,775
There you are, Takagi.

193
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,575
I just got a call from Inspector Megure.

194
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:50,275
He said you should stay in this room until he tells you what to do.

195
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,775
He really said that? What about Yumi?

196
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:56,575
Oh, Inspector gave her instructions and she left.

197
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,175
Okay.

198
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,275
But where is she going?

199
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:05,375
Now here comes the bride, being escorted by her father.

200
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,875
Please welcome with applause.

201
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,075
Wait a minute.

202
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:26,675
It's been half a year, hasn't it?

203
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:29,775
My two friends!

204
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:30,875
That's him!

205
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,875
-Arrest him! -Yes, sir...

206
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,875
Hey! Don't you even think about it!

207
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,875
You think I didn't know cops are among those attendants?

208
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,175
Don't worry.

209
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:44,175
I'll disappear after cutting these two people into pieces.

210
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,575
Please, no more stupid acting.

211
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,575
Officer?

212
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:52,575
What are you talking about?

213
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:55,675
I'm the one who broke into that girl's house six months ago!

214
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,275
Are you joking?

215
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:01,075
You gotta stop this. You look pathetic.

216
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:04,175
There's no way that you are the killer.

217
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,375
How?

218
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,175
How do you know that he isn't the killer?

219
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,675
What do you mean?

220
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,775
Six months ago,

221
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,775
when you went to Ms. Rei's house and chased the robber off,

222
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,975
the inside of the house was totally dark.

223
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:21,675
That means it was impossible to recognize him by his appearance.

224
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,875
You obviously couldn't know by just looking at him, right?

225
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,375
It's the voice.

226
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,775
Really?

227
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,075
I thought you said the killer's voice wasn't distinct enough to identify.

228
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,675
I just saw him a while ago.

229
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:37,175
The police officer who has the same voice as this masked man.

230
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,975
Really? Where did you see him?

231
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:40,975
I don't know.

232
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,475
I think it was inside the building.

233
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:45,175
I have to be right.

234
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:47,475
No one would play such a joke here.

235
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,875
We don't have any friend who would do things like this.

236
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,275
You're right. This guy is my subordinate.

237
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,575
But it's weird.

238
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,675
He was by the Teimuzu River

239
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:01,875
and he got here just a minute ago.

240
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,675
It's Officer Chiba.

241
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:05,975
What?

242
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,375
Now, let me ask you again.

243
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,475
Why did you think that he was not the serial killer?

244
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,975
Well, that's...

245
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:19,675
Also, tell us why you opened the package you received earlier,

246
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,275
without even knowing who it was from.

247
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:28,375
Normally, people wouldn't open it without checking what's inside

248
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,275
because there might be some dangerous things in it.

249
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,675
What was your confidence based on?

250
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:35,375
Yes. The confidence that made you think

251
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,275
that no dangerous objects would be delivered to you,

252
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,375
or no such person as "serial killer" would be coming.

253
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,375
I know why you were so confident.

254
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,275
Because you already

255
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,475
murdered that serial killer...

256
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:52,375
at the empty warehouse by Teimuzu River.

257
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:57,375
You murdered the serial killer!

258
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:09,268
Come on! You have to explain it to me!

259
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:11,868
How come only I have to stay in this dressing room?

260
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:14,568
Well, they are busy right now.

261
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:17,868
Then tell me where Yumi and Ms. Sato went.

262
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:20,068
Just tell me anything.

263
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,568
Sato should be with you right now to protect you.

264
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:24,568
Well, she's not here.

265
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:26,468
What? Why not?

266
00:14:26,468 --> 00:14:28,968
That's why I'm asking because I don't see them here.

267
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,568
Hey, we're on a mission right now.

268
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:34,668
You got to be more serious, Ms. Sato.

269
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:38,768
What? I murdered the serial killer?

270
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:42,568
All I said was the serial killer wouldn't come to this wedding

271
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:46,168
where all the cops are waiting for him.

272
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:49,768
What does it have to do with murdering him?

273
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:50,868
You know what?

274
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,268
Before asking me such dumb questions,

275
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,468
you should investigate who those three guys are

276
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,568
because they are people my wife doesn't know.

277
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,268
No. They are clean.

278
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:59,268
Because all those guys talked to Yumi

279
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:03,068
whom they thought was Ms. Rei.

280
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,468
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

281
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:09,868
Hi, Ms. Masudo.

282
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,868
Hey.

283
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:16,668
If one of them murdered and was disguised as the serial killer,

284
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,468
he would have avoided contact with the bride until he takes action.

285
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,468
That's right.

286
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:21,668
It is too risky to talk to her

287
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:24,968
because you don't know what the killer said to the bride.

288
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:27,668
And the bride heard their voice.

289
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:31,468
They wouldn't know whether she remembers what kind of voice they had.

290
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:34,268
So if the killer did come here,

291
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,068
he wouldn't want to talk with her too early.

292
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:44,668
Well, we didn't notice it until Mr. Mouri pointed it out.

293
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,968
Then, what about their left ring finger?

294
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,368
They were all hiding it, remember?

295
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:51,668
It was just a coincidence.

296
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:54,568
But let's just that say one of them robbed Ms. Masudo's house.

297
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,968
We found the fingerprint on the cooking knife,

298
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,668
but the robber was wearing gloves.

299
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,568
Which means, he touched the knife with his bare hands beforehand.

300
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:05,668
If so, then it is less likely

301
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:07,468
that they remember which hand touched the cooking knife.

302
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,468
Therefore, they would be hiding both of their hands.

303
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,768
Except you, though.

304
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:15,868
You knew that the police was going to ask you about the fingerprint.

305
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,668
So you lied that you broke your left thumb and wrist

306
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:20,168
while struggling with the robber,

307
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:22,468
to hide your left arm with a cast.

308
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,168
That way, you can avoid leaving your fingerprints behind

309
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,968
so the police won't suspect you.

310
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:29,468
You did it because the fingerprint left on that cooking knife was yours.

311
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:34,868
You touched the knife while struggling with the robber.

312
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,068
Also, we found only your left hand fingerprint

313
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:41,168
because your right hand was holding something.

314
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,268
Do you remember what Ms. Rei said?

315
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,568
She groped her way through the dark house and ran.

316
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,868
But she was caught by the robber at the door.

317
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:49,868
Then you came to save her

318
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:53,668
and she saw that the robber had a stye on his right eye.

319
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:57,968
If she could see a stye on his eye when you came to save her,

320
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:02,468
indicates that you were holding a flashlight at the time.

321
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:04,368
-That tells me... -That tells me...

322
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:07,068
that he knew that the electric wiring in her house had been cut

323
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,668
way before he came to save Ms. Masudo.

324
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:13,868
In conclusion, he was also the robber.

325
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:21,468
Well, luckily, you were fighting the robber on a rug.

326
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:24,668
Thus, you left only your fingerprint on the cooking knife.

327
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:29,468
Otherwise, your fingerprints may have been on the floor.

328
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:32,368
The reason why you saved Ms. Rei

329
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:38,368
was because you felt sorry for her while robbing her house, right?

330
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:39,968
Being betrayed by him,

331
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:44,468
the robber was waiting for the opportunity for his revenge.

332
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:47,568
But what you did was you let him break into your house,

333
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:51,468
display the old data about the wedding on your computer

334
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,768
and make him believe that the wedding was yesterday.

335
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:57,968
Then you found him wandering around this building yesterday,

336
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,268
trying to take revenge on you.

337
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:01,468
Saying that you want to apologize,

338
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:05,968
you took him to the warehouse by Teimuzu River and killed him.

339
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,868
Well, am I wrong?

340
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:10,468
Yeah, that's almost right.

341
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:11,968
But the reason I saved this girl

342
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:15,568
was because I could get more money that way than killing her.

343
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:17,068
You! How could you say that?

344
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:21,068
I tried to explain it to that fool.

345
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,668
He didn't get it, so I killed him.

346
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:28,068
All he could do was to open safes. He was a useless man after all.

347
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:29,968
Yes, that's right.

348
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,668
Just like the police!

349
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,968
Showing a knife in front of a serial killer?

350
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,668
You police are helpless!

351
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:45,868
Darn it!

352
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:46,968
Hey, Conan!

353
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,068
Don't even think about it!

354
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,468
Only police officers are here other than the bride's father!

355
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:54,668
You cannot run away!

356
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,168
Run away?

357
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,468
My life's over once my fingerprints are checked.

358
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:00,468
If so...

359
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,168
I may as well kill as many people as I can with me

360
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,368
to the other side.

361
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:08,568
Yumi?

362
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:12,868
Yumi!

363
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:16,068
Yumi!

364
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:18,668
Yumi?

365
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:20,068
Sorry!

366
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:21,768
I am not Miwako.

367
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,768
But that's Ms. Sato's clothes, right?

368
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,868
Right! We changed!

369
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,468
People didn't notice because I fixed my hair in Japanese style.

370
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,568
You changed your hairstyle?

371
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,368
The reason why I was clinging to you

372
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:39,668
was to make Miwako wants to wear a wedding dress.

373
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:44,168
She was trying hard to become your bride.

374
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,468
Because she has muscles on her back,

375
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:48,468
the protective vest could not fit in.

376
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:50,868
So where's Ms. Sato?

377
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:54,568
I took her to the ceremony hall as Inspector told me to

378
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,968
but I don't know what happened later.

379
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:56,968
Yumi!

380
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,468
One down.

381
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:15,468
No way!

382
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,968
Did you know?

383
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,168
Corset wires are pretty hard.

384
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:26,468
Miwako?

385
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,468
Sato?

386
00:20:39,768 --> 00:20:40,768
Get out of my way!

387
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:42,768
Hey!

388
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,668
I can't use my martial art skills in a wedding dress.

389
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:49,468
Good!

390
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,368
I forgot.

391
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:55,168
-Get out of my way, kid! -Conan!

392
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:56,468
Ran, you gotta stop him!

393
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,368
I had to do that, right?

394
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,268
-I guess so. -Ms. Sato!

395
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:17,168
Wait!

396
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,368
Ms. Sato.

397
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,868
It's over!

398
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:29,868
Ms. Sato!

399
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:32,168
Takagi?

400
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:36,068
Yeah! I got it!

401
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:39,168
Takagi, why?

402
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:41,368
Please, don't ask me.

403
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:49,268
What were you doing, Takagi?

404
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:03,768
Gotta be careful around those ladies. Seriously.

405
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:35,868
Really? You already realized that the groom was suspicious, Officer Sato?

406
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:39,268
Yeah. It wasn't hard to piece everything together.

407
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:42,168
I noticed the second I saw the video.

408
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:46,568
Even with his wrist and thumb broken, he was able to change fast.

409
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:51,268
That's why I thought he had a cast on just to hide his fingerprints.

410
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:54,168
Besides, he hid the fact that his house was broken into.

411
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,668
I see. If he called the police,

412
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,468
they will find out that he's the serial killer by his fingerprints.

413
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:04,968
I figured that the bride shouldn't be beside such a dangerous man.

414
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:07,968
So I became the fake bride instead of Yumi.

415
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:13,968
But you seemed glad to be wearing a wedding dress.

416
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:15,268
Not really.

417
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:17,468
I don't look good in that kind of stuff.

418
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,568
Do you think so?

419
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,368
But it was surprising, wasn't it?

420
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:24,568
Who would have thought the beard man was a famous photographer

421
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,668
who made the poster for the wedding hall?

422
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,468
Hey, just hurry past it!

423
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:35,568
It's so embarrassing. Walk faster, guys!

424
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:36,868
Hurry, hurry!

425
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:39,168
Go on, Yumi. Go, Takagi.

426
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,068
Come on, everyone.

427
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:44,568
It was a prophetic dream, but it's over now.

428
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,768
Izawa, Yamamoto and Murakoshi...

429
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,768
Okay. Three more people to go.

430
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:54,668
It's vandalism if you tear it down.

431
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,268
I know that.

432
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:58,268
What were you thinking, Chiba?

433
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,668
"Next Episode"

434
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,968
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

435
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:06,968
The sign looks like a haunted house

436
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:09,268
which you really like!

437
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,168
Somebody's trying to kill you?

438
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,368
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

439
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,768
It looked that way to me, too!

440
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,768
Wait!

441
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:30,968
Next Conan, "Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

442
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:48,668
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,968
"Stage Light"

444
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,468
Which type of wedding ceremony is it?

445
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,868
-Is it a trick or magic? -Are you joking?
