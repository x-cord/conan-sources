1
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:10,448
Eh?! Kaitou ♪1412 disguised
himself as Daddy to get on the ship?!

2
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:16,908
I just found his disguise
and props in the bathroom!

3
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,868
The officers are checking it now!

4
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:25,668
But this is him. I doubt
they'll find any evidence...

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,158
Oh? Where's Ran-neechan?

6
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:32,028
Out looking for you,
since you didn't come back.

7
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:37,098
She was worried
Kaitou ♪1412 had caught you.

8
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:39,558
It's not "♪1412."

9
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:45,408
His name is Kaitou Kid!
Get it right!

10
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:46,988
Okay...

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,528
Who's he?

12
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:56,908
Inspector Nakamori. He works
full-time pursuing the Kaitou Kid.

13
00:00:56,908 --> 00:01:03,238
Like you, he's a reliable knight
we hired to protect the Black Star.

14
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:04,918
Still, Madam!

15
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:12,408
All 500 people here
are wearing black pearls!

16
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:17,848
And except for the real one,
they're all imitations!

17
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:21,808
I can't guard it unless
I know which one is real...

18
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:26,238
They all look alike,
but they're still imitations.

19
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:29,868
Close scrutiny could
narrow it down a bit;

20
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:34,488
among them are dull
and dreary ones such as mine

21
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:40,618
and excessively
shiny rubbish such as yours.

22
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,878
But checking every
person in this crowd would be...

23
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:48,528
Then I'll give you a special hint.

24
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:53,158
The Black Star, the black pearl
with a peacock-green luster

25
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:57,278
that fascinated my
grandfather sixty years ago,

26
00:01:57,278 --> 00:02:00,808
is with someone
especially worthy of it.

27
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,088
Worthy?!

28
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:07,728
Coincidentally, that someone
is one out of five hundred...

29
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,188
It must be a woman,
if the jewel suits them...

30
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:15,028
Oh, but it suits you, too, Mori-san!

31
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:16,908
Oh, so it is you!

32
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,368
Hatamoto Joji (41)
lt's good to see you again!

33
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:21,618
Thank you for your help a while back!
Hatamoto Joji (41)

34
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,538
Aren't you the Hatamoto Group's--

35
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:28,318
Yes! Thanks to this fine
woman and the president,

36
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,068
I've opened up more restaurants!

37
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,668
In fact, tonight's meal is my own--

38
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:35,008
So sorry, Joji-san.

39
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:37,368
Mifune Takuya (26)
Seems Mr. Suzuki won't be there,

40
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,448
thanks to the Kaitou Kid.
Mifune Takuya (26)

41
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,598
Your flattery food will go to waste!
Mifune Takuya (26)

42
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:41,718
Your flattery food will go to waste!

43
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,688
You're as reprehensible as ever!

44
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:45,518
Nothing of the sort!

45
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:50,228
The guy from the
Yotsui girl's birthday party...

46
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,138
Oh? You're not wearing yours?

47
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:56,198
I hate childish games like this.

48
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:59,568
But you'll seem suspicious
if you don't wear it.

49
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:00,698
Fine.

50
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,958
Eh? Ayako-san isn't here?

51
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,908
Tomizawa Yuzo (28)
No, she couldn't make it...

52
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,418
Oh. That's too bad...
Tomizawa Yuzo (28)

53
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,868
This is the Suzuki
Industries party, all right.

54
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:18,838
It's teeming with rich kids
and company presidents.

55
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:21,868
Ran's taking a long time...

56
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:26,058
She's probably lost somewhere!
Ran has no sense of direction!

57
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,518
Who has no sense of direction?!

58
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:31,368
Oh, Ran! I didn't see you there!

59
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:32,978
I'm Police Commissioner Chaki!

60
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,778
You may have already heard,

61
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:40,948
but that pesky villain has
somehow boarded the ship!

62
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,908
As you know,
he's a master of disguise!

63
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:47,238
He possesses an immeasurable
evil talent that he uses

64
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:51,488
to learn about his target
and fully imitate them,

65
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:54,548
even down to their face,
voice, and personality!

66
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:59,758
He may even be among you already!

67
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:03,968
Normally, we would carefully
inspect each and every person,

68
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:07,428
but we'll refrain
from such incivility here.

69
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:09,198
Passwords!

70
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:13,398
Pair up with the person next
to you and decide on a password!

71
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:19,198
I get it! That way he
can't keep disguising himself,

72
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:22,868
which will allow the
police to single him out!

73
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:28,068
What should our password be?

74
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,568
OK, when I say "Holmes"...

75
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,998
...I'll say "Lupin"!

76
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:39,028
What're you doing, Power Room?!

77
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,528
No, this is--

78
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,758
Kaitou Kid!

79
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:48,978
Your passwords are pointless.

80
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:49,728
What?!

81
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:53,188
The Black Star is
already in my hands.

82
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,648
Impossible!

83
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:59,408
Oh, dear. It's the pesky thief.

84
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:03,278
I'll just have to punish
this scheming boy.

85
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:11,288
Mom!

86
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:17,738
What have you done?!

87
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:21,378
There's no need to worry,
Inspector. After all...

88
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:23,838
...he's still alive!

89
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:31,448
My guards caught him
in the tablecloth

90
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,398
after I pretended to shoot
him with this model gun.

91
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:40,358
Yes. He's a brilliant magician
I hired as entertainment...

92
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:43,818
...Sanada Kazumi-kun!
Sanada Kazumi (27) - Magician

93
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:47,528
Let's give him a round of
applause for acting out

94
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,988
the Kaitou Kid's
pitiable end for us!

95
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:57,748
I see. Kaitou Kid is an expert magician--
the perfect role for you.

96
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:03,468
The two of us do happen to
be artists who deceive the eyes...

97
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:04,888
Artists?!

98
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,848
...but I'm a magician by nature.
A thief is no match for me!

99
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:13,118
Now, then! Please come to the stage!

100
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:14,868
I'll show you some of my magic!

101
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:19,818
A kaitou is a creative artist
who skillfully steals his prey,

102
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,488
but a detective is
nothing more than a critic

103
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:25,778
who finds fault
in what is left behind!

104
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:29,828
This sensation!

105
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:33,788
It's him! He's somewhere in here!

106
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:36,958
I'll begin with a simple card trick!

107
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:41,418
Hold on. I've always
been the skeptical type.

108
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,868
May I cut that deck?

109
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,388
Certainly. Would any
others like to as well?

110
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:51,348
Who is it?! Who's the Kaitou Kid?!

111
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:53,308
Darn it!

112
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,728
They all seem suspicious!

113
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:59,028
There's what she said...

114
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:04,148
The black pearl is with
someone especially worthy of it.

115
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,948
If only I knew what that meant!

116
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,738
I apologize!

117
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:16,748
That's all right! Spilled cards
won't ruin my luck (tsuki).

118
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:18,718
Moon (tsuki)?

119
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:24,698
Say, didn't you have a
list of everyone at this party?

120
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:25,488
Yeah...

121
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,028
Can I see it?

122
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,218
This? Here.

123
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:33,118
Here you are!

124
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,238
Thank you, ladies!

125
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:38,158
Let me give you a card in return!

126
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,558
Are you sure?!

127
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:45,238
Wait! First, let me use my
X-ray eye to read your minds

128
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,488
and predict your card!

129
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,158
I'm so excited!

130
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:51,738
Yeah!

131
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,158
Now I see!

132
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:58,568
That's why he said that in the 2nd letter!

133
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,128
I've figured it out, Kaitou Kid!

134
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,668
The location of your prey, that is!

135
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,368
A pigeon (hato)? Hato? Heart?

136
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,388
The Ace of Hearts, then!

137
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:17,558
Please pick any card you wish!

138
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:21,198
Ran! The right! The right one!

139
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:28,488
"As Caesar was with Cleopatra,
I am already by your side.

140
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:29,608
- Kaitou Kid"

141
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:31,048
The Kid!

142
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,068
He's here!

143
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,538
Calm down, everyone!
Confirm your passwords!

144
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:40,488
Hey! Nakamori-kun! Don't tell
me it's already been stolen!

145
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:43,998
No, he doesn't have it yet,
nor has he escaped!

146
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:48,418
He's simply confusing us
to make things work his way!

147
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:52,868
Don't worry, we can catch him!
He's not a wizard!

148
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,888
He's a human being
who relies on tricks!

149
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,158
Kaitou Kid really left a message?!

150
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:10,738
Yep! It was on
the card Ran just picked!

151
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:15,198
But when and how
did he put this in there?!

152
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:19,318
The Kid is crafty!
Everything about him is a mystery!

153
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:24,868
All we know is that he's
somewhere in here!

154
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,408
Please calm down, everyone!

155
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:31,628
Does that mean he knows
where the real pearl is?!

156
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:37,488
Even if he did,
this is a floating prison.

157
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:41,068
Could he possibly
make off with the Black Star

158
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:44,098
with this police presence?

159
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:02,488
Inspector! We'll arrive in
Tokyo Harbor in thirty minutes!

160
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:07,378
Alright! Seal all the exits!
Let no one outside!

161
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:10,698
Time to show yourself,
Kaitou Kid!

162
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:15,338
This is your only chance to
strike while everyone's restless!

163
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:19,368
Hey, Ran! Where'd your pearl go?!

164
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,308
Eh?! No way!

165
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:25,348
Excuse me! Could someone
pick up that pearl?

166
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:30,358
What the...

167
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:31,478
What was that sound?!

168
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:35,198
The pearl! It exploded!

169
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:38,408
Don't tell me the Kid rigged them!

170
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:45,338
Forget this!

171
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,538
I'm not wearing this thing!

172
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,758
Calm down, everyone! Calm down!

173
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:58,888
Mom!

174
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,538
Are you all right?!

175
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:02,348
Yes. Thank you, Ran-chan!

176
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,888
Open the door this instant!

177
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:07,148
I can't do that!

178
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:11,198
Huh?! Your pearl is gone, too!

179
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:19,908
The Kid! He stole the Black Star!

180
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:24,778
What?! So you were
wearing the real one?!

181
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,238
Inspector! We can't hold them back!

182
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,258
Inspector! A large
group has gotten out!

183
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:38,248
The Kid's with them! Capture him!

184
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:38,968
Yes, sir!

185
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,598
Ran-neechan! Let's go catch him, too!

186
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,308
Wait, Conan-kun!

187
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:46,518
I know who the Kaitou Kid is!

188
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,380
A letter declaring the upcoming theft
of the Suzuki family's Black Star

189
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,670
arrived at Sonoko's house.

190
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,380
The sender was one Kaitou Kid.

191
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,850
Upon cracking his code, I waited
for him atop the Haido City Hotel.

192
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,350
He landed silently before me

193
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,100
so as not to disturb
the stillness of the night.

194
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,360
I only had one chance
to use my tranquilizer gun!

195
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,320
The instant he turned away to escape!

196
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:25,090
But instead of running, he imitated
multiple voices without a machine

197
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,370
to lure the police in,
and then vanished like smoke!

198
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,750
All that remained was another letter.

199
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,300
Against Inspector Nakamori's protests,

200
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,670
the Suzuki Industries' 60th anniversary
boat party began as scheduled.

201
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,970
Sonoko's mother,
Suzuki Tomoko, devised a plan

202
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,100
that looked to spell
failure for the Kaitou Kid,

203
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,600
but he blew up the pearls and stole
the Black Star during the confusion!

204
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,980
I've figured out who you are, Kaitou Kid!

205
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,740
What?! You didn't find the Kid?!

206
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,700
No. We checked all the passengers
who left the room earlier, but...

207
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:14,090
He has to be on board still!
Check every last person on the ship!

208
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,090
Yes, sir!

209
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:23,380
But how did he know she was
wearing the real Black Star?!

210
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,840
This is the engine room,
Conan-kun!

211
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,180
Is the Kaitou Kid really in here?

212
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,050
Say, Ran-neechan. Do you
know about the language of jewels?

213
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,470
The language of jewels?

214
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,840
A pearl means "moon" or "woman."

215
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,470
Of the passengers on board,
the only woman with moons in her name

216
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,550
is Suzuki Tomoko-san.

217
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,090
In other words, she had the real one!

218
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
But how does that
tell you who the Kid is?

219
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,880
The cards!

220
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,760
You know how the card
you chose had his message?

221
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,340
Yeah...

222
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,720
It's a basic trick in which the magician
used the pigeon in his right hand

223
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,230
to distract the audience while
he switched decks in his left hand.

224
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,940
So the chosen card would be
fixed regardless of who cut the deck.

225
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,380
So if the message
was on that card...

226
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,910
...does that mean
Kaitou Kid was that magician?!

227
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,370
No! I watched the whole time,
but he never got near the lady!

228
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,550
Then who is it?!

229
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,840
There's one other person
who could've switched cards!

230
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,670
Yes! That person made them fall,
pretended to pick them up,

231
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,720
then removed a card
and added the message!

232
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:58,680
They hid it in their palm and
pretended to pull it from the deck!

233
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,360
Right, Ran-neechan?

234
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,020
Or should I say, Kaitou Kid-san!

235
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,580
This is Chopper ♪1!
He hasn't fled outside!

236
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,540
This is Chopper ♪2!
No suspicious people on deck!

237
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,800
This is Surveillance!
Sonar and radar show nothing!

238
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Alright! Keep your eyes peeled!

239
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,760
All onboard officers are
to split up onto each floor

240
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,430
and capture the Kid on sight!

241
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,350
Don't let a familiar face fool you!
He's a master of disguise!

242
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,550
Yes. You switched places with
Ran when she left to find me.

243
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,490
Impressive. I hadn't noticed at all.

244
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:57,410
After becoming Ran, you agitated
everyone with your message

245
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,300
and scattered the exploding
pearls to cause mass panic.

246
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,040
You then stole the real Black
Star during the confusion

247
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,260
by pretending to prop her up.

248
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,240
Huh?! Your pearl is gone, too!

249
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,020
The Kid! He stole the Black Star!

250
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,010
The fact that you prepared
those fireworks means you knew

251
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,480
she had a large number
of replicas made.

252
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,300
Quit joking around, Conan-kun!

253
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,840
I didn't know which one was
real, and I didn't have any hints!

254
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,420
You didn't need hints to
know which one was real!

255
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,710
Once she took her pearl
out with a glove, that is.

256
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,670
Pearls are made of calcium carbonate
and are highly reactive to acid.

257
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,680
Oil in the fingers would oxidize
the surface and make it lose its luster.

258
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,230
Some people realized, though...

259
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,240
...Realized that she'd never give
such a delicate jewel to anyone else!

260
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,640
But that's not enough to--

261
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,950
Indeed, that wouldn't be enough.

262
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,220
But add her dull pearl to the equation
and speculation becomes certainty!

263
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,880
Yes. Just as old pearls in famous
museums fade in color over time,

264
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,760
a pearl's luster lasts
a few decades at most.

265
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,630
The Black Star was
purchased sixty years ago;

266
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,010
it can't possibly look flawless now.

267
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,730
So it would have been obvious

268
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,300
once you saw her carefully
handle her faded pearl with gloves!

269
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,550
Talk about pathetic!

270
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,160
I was so concerned with
you that I completely forgot!

271
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,080
But wasn't the Black Star
in the museum all shiny?

272
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,290
That's why you didn't take it.
You knew it was a fake.

273
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,130
Then you challenged
her in your second letter

274
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,590
and told her to bring the real one.

275
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,560
You even made
sure to write "the real one."

276
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,770
Here! If you suspect me that much,
I'll call a policeman to--

277
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,450
I won't let you disappear
like you did on that roof!

278
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,330
You didn't call for the
police that time to spite me!

279
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,290
You acted like you were
about to hang-glide out,

280
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,250
but you quickly dressed up
as an officer during the flash,

281
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,420
and hid yourself among them!

282
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,930
Besides, it's senseless
to ask for help here...

283
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,630
...I set up this 1-on-1
match out of respect

284
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,850
for the criminal artist who snuck
on board amidst all the security.

285
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,280
Yes. Most great artists
become famous after they die.

286
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,240
I'll make you a great
master, Kaitou Kid.

287
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,050
Once I place you in
the cemetery known as jail.

288
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,170
I surrender.
I'll give up on this pearl.

289
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,010
Tell the lady I'm
sorry for ruining the party!

290
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,430
Now you're sorry...

291
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:49,840
Oh, yeah! The girl I knocked
out to get these clothes...

292
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,390
She'll catch cold if we don't hurry!

293
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,060
I'm a perfectionist, you see!

294
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,360
Another flash grenade!

295
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,200
Oh no!

296
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,160
Damn! I won't let you escape!

297
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,120
Bastard!

298
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,830
I'll get you for this!

299
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,660
Hey! There's a girl asleep in this boat!

300
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,380
What?!

301
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,110
What's she doing in here?
Anyway, let's get her out...

302
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,440
Stop!

303
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,360
No! Don't take her out! Stop!

304
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,570
Huh? Wha...

305
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,170
"This crimson dress you gave me
the other day suits you wonderfully.

306
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,130
- The Occasional Dry Cleaner, Kaitou Kid"

307
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,300
Bastard...

308
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:23,650
They later found the hang glider
Kaitou Kid planned to escape with,

309
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,860
but he, himself, had completely
vanished from the ship.

310
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:11,470
There you are! "Grade-schooler
Protects Black Star!"

311
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,930
You're a big hero, Conan-kun!

312
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,890
Come on, it was just luck!

313
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,760
But you guys actually
met the Kid! You're so lucky!

314
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,860
Not.

315
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Say, what did he look like?!

316
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,760
Ran?

317
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,550
What?

318
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,070
The Kid's face!

319
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,530
Sorry! He knocked me out too fast...

320
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,870
I saw his face, though.

321
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,300
What kind of older man was he?!

322
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,210
He was surprisingly young.
In his twenties, or maybe...

323
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,130
Don't give me your cold!

324
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,090
Falling into the ocean while touring
the Selizabeth! Talk about stupid!

325
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,840
You're so annoying.

326
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,020
It's that brat's fault!
Swimming away was my only option!

327
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,980
Hey! That high-schooler...

328
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,560
Doesn't he look like Shinichi-kun?

329
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,130
You think?

330
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,330
Maybe the guy
you saw in Shibuya was...

331
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,470
Whew!

332
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,700
That's good to hear!

333
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,645
Next Conan's Hint:

334
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:57,649
Next Conan's Hint:
Rival Detective.

335
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:59,937
Rival Detective.
