1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.000
Are we really doing this?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.810
Yeah. After all, she's bad news.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.690
If we're doing this, now's our chance.

4
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.650
But if someone finds out,
we'll both be arrested.

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.760
Nah. Our alibis are perfect, and
I'll be the one to finish her off.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000
Got it. Let's do it, then.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.970
Let's shop!

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.820
We're here for products available today only.

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460

Let's get pumped!

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.730
Yeah...

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.830
Yeah!

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.860
Happy Seal, go, go!

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.610

Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!

32
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.600
Huh, so it's a seal toy.
Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!

33
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.530
Ow...

34
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.360
I'm really sorry suddenly asking
you to take some time off for us.

It's fine. We're much obliged to your father.

39
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.530
Here you are.
Yasuda

40
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.460
Thank you.

41
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.410
Sonoko-san, if you'd only asked, we would
have set aside some limited products for you.

42
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.400
That's not good enough.

43
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.150
I have to get it myself in order to—

44
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670
Ayaka-chan, hurry up and move some stuff.

Ayaka-chan, hurry up and move some stuff.

46
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.800
What? But I just painted my nails.

47
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.680
See?

48
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.730
It's those girls from earlier.

49
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.670
Find the question that solves the mystery!

50
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.950
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

51
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.810
A secret battle between a group of girls!

52
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.800
A case breaks out backstage!

53
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.470
Always determining the one truth

54
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.250
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

55
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.200
his name is Detective Conan!

00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:58.887

The Feuding Girls

59
00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:06.427
You knew from the start that
we'd be carrying stuff.

60
00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:10.547
Sorry, but I won an
audition for a commercial.

61
00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:12.327
I need to look pretty.

62
00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:15.037
Mai, you were rejected, weren't you?

63
00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:16.347
That's too bad.

64
00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:17.937
Ayaka-chan!

65
00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:21.437
Oh, please. You're both scowling.

66
00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:24.857
Mai?

67
00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:33.387
I'll leave this stuff here.

68
00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:35.787
Ayaka-san, help carry something.

69
00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:40.237
Mina-san, can I take tomorrow off?

70
00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:42.607
I'd like to practice for my commercial.

71
00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:46.827
Hold on. You can't suddenly
ask for the day off.

72
00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.257
Right, Yuko-chan?

73
00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:49.517
She's right.

74
00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:51.567
And besides, if you work hard on this job,

75
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:54.477
you might get an even better offer next time.

76
00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:55.667
That's right.

77
00:04:55.667 --> 00:05:01.147
But wouldn't trying hard on the commercial
get me an even better job than this one?

78
00:05:01.347 --> 00:05:04.577
Ayaka, are you making fun of this job?

79
00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:05.527
Mina-san!

80
00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:08.197
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:09.867
I get it.

82
00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:15.187
Ayaka-san, you're acting
a little strange today.

83
00:05:15.187 --> 00:05:16.417
Try to be more considerate of the others.

84
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:18.097
Just ignore her.

85
00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:21.967
She doesn't want to do this
tough low-paying job anymore.

86
00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:22.707
But...

87
00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:28.447
What are you doing?

88
00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:30.127
Jeez, you're clumsy.

89
00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:33.057
Ayaka! You did that on purpose, didn't you?

90
00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:35.057
What? On purpose?

91
00:05:35.057 --> 00:05:35.887
How could you say that?

92
00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:37.347
Don't be ridiculous!

93
00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:39.597
Ow! What was that for?

94
00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:43.107
Please stop, both of you!

95
00:05:44.337 --> 00:05:47.937
Let's try to get along while we're
working on this campaign, okay?

96
00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:50.857
God, you're so annoying!

97
00:05:55.777 --> 00:05:57.247
I-I'm sorry!

98
00:05:57.677 --> 00:05:59.457
Did we get any on you?

99
00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:01.577
I'm fine.

100
00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:03.577
I'm really sorry.

101
00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:26.317
The limited products go on sale soon, Sonoko.

102
00:06:26.317 --> 00:06:30.097
Yeah. It was worth standing
in line for thirty minutes.

103
00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:34.277
What are you spacing out for?

104
00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:35.437
Ow!

105
00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:40.707
What was that?

106
00:06:45.897 --> 00:06:46.627
What's wrong?

107
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.547
A-Ayaka is...

108
00:06:57.537 --> 00:06:58.617
She's gone.

109
00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:00.807
No way. Ayaka?

110
00:07:01.827 --> 00:07:03.127
Did she fall from there?

111
00:07:03.127 --> 00:07:04.847
What is it, kid?

112
00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:06.047
Conan-kun?

113
00:07:06.047 --> 00:07:08.467
Call the police, Ran-neechan.

114
00:07:09.007 --> 00:07:09.687
Okay.

115
00:07:13.377 --> 00:07:14.487
What's this?

116
00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:22.407
The estimated time of death is around 2:30PM.

117
00:07:22.407 --> 00:07:25.277
This storage room within a shopping
mall where the crime took place

118
00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:26.827
happens to be under construction.

119
00:07:27.107 --> 00:07:32.587
The victim Saijo Ayaka-san seems to have
fallen from the construction scaffolding.

120
00:07:32.757 --> 00:07:34.097
I see.

121
00:07:34.097 --> 00:07:36.057
Which means this was an accident.

122
00:07:36.057 --> 00:07:37.967
Actually, about that...

123
00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:42.227
There were signs that the scaffolding the
victim fell from had been tampered with.

124
00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:47.017
What? Which means this could be a murder?

125
00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:48.357
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.277
And? Who are these three?

127
00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:57.187
They're colleagues of the late Ayaka-san.

128
00:07:57.187 --> 00:08:00.027
Fukamoto Mai-san discovered the body.

129
00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:03.597
I see. Could you describe the circumstances
under which you found her?

130
00:08:03.597 --> 00:08:07.627
Come to think of it, everyone
was arguing with Ayaka-san.

131
00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:09.207
Hey, Conan-kun!

132
00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:11.317
Is that true, Ran-san?

133
00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:13.297
Yes, I suppose.

134
00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:14.877
I see.

135
00:08:15.097 --> 00:08:16.557
Please don't do this.

136
00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:19.327
It's true that we argued with Ayaka.

137
00:08:19.327 --> 00:08:21.177
But it's not possible.

138
00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:22.877
We wouldn't kill Ayaka.

139
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.137
Th-That's right.

140
00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:29.147
Then where were you around
2:30PM when Ayaka-san died?

141
00:08:29.477 --> 00:08:31.177
Well...

142
00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.577
I was...

143
00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:37.657
I was here preparing for the sale
this afternoon along with the staff.

144
00:08:39.407 --> 00:08:41.157
And? What about you two?

145
00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:48.467
I was actually skipping work to watch
the concert going on in the event space.

146
00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:49.727
Mina-san...

147
00:08:49.727 --> 00:08:50.787
Sorry.

148
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:52.647
I see.

149
00:08:52.647 --> 00:08:54.407
What about you?

150
00:08:57.127 --> 00:09:02.717
Actually, we found this in the
garbage can in the hallway.

151
00:09:03.137 --> 00:09:07.037
"Dear Mai, sorry about
earlier. I got carried away."

152
00:09:07.037 --> 00:09:11.227
"I'd like to apologize, so please come to
floor 2, section 3 of the storage room around 3PM."

153
00:09:11.577 --> 00:09:12.797
"From Ayaka."

154
00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:15.737
Th-That's...

155
00:09:17.487 --> 00:09:22.237
Also, we also found this at the crime scene.

156
00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:24.997
That's Mai-san's...

157
00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:28.557
Are you certain this is yours?

158
00:09:28.557 --> 00:09:31.147
Y-Yes, b-but...

159
00:09:31.147 --> 00:09:32.747
Is this what happened, then?

160
00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:37.967
Mai-san received a letter from Ayaka-san
saying she wanted to apologize.

161
00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:42.017
She secretly went to the storage
room and broke the scaffolding.

162
00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:46.767
Then she feigned innocence and met Ayaka-san
on the second floor of the storage room.

163
00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:52.647
But she dropped her brooch then.

164
00:09:52.647 --> 00:09:53.437
You're wrong!

165
00:09:53.907 --> 00:09:55.687
I didn't do that!

166
00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:58.277
It's true that I went to the storage room.

167
00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.197
Ayaka said she wanted to apologize...

168
00:10:00.507 --> 00:10:02.587
But I didn't do it!

169
00:10:02.587 --> 00:10:05.937
By the time I went, Ayaka was already dead!

170
00:10:05.937 --> 00:10:07.697
You have to believe me!

171
00:10:31.387 --> 00:10:33.477
Don't do that, Conan-kun.

172
00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:35.567
You shouldn't wander around the crime scene.

173
00:10:35.567 --> 00:10:36.477
Sorry.

174
00:10:36.857 --> 00:10:39.857
Ran-neechan, doesn't this
seem the other way around?

175
00:10:40.257 --> 00:10:41.147
The other way around?

176
00:10:41.427 --> 00:10:45.277
Yeah. It was Ayaka-san who
asked Mai-san to come here.

177
00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:49.787
But Mai-san is thought to have
tampered with the scaffolding.

178
00:10:50.097 --> 00:10:56.047
Normally wouldn't the person who did
the tampering invite their victim here?

179
00:10:56.927 --> 00:10:58.847
Now that you mention it, you're right.

180
00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:01.297
But that would mean...

181
00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:06.347
That marks where Mai-san's
brooch fell, right?

182
00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:08.097
Yeah, probably.

183
00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:10.087
But if it's the other way around, then...

184
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:10.807
Watch out!

185
00:11:18.697 --> 00:11:20.437
Are you okay, Ran-neechan?

186
00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:23.247
Yeah. Thanks, Conan-kun.

187
00:11:24.997 --> 00:11:27.037
That was close.

188
00:11:27.037 --> 00:11:29.427
The belt holding it in place is loose.

189
00:11:32.437 --> 00:11:33.417
What's this?

190
00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:40.347
That's Ayaka-san's...

191
00:11:41.547 --> 00:11:43.027
Did you find something?

192
00:11:43.027 --> 00:11:43.827
Yeah.

193
00:11:43.827 --> 00:11:45.217
Hey, you!

194
00:11:46.287 --> 00:11:48.927
You can't come in here! It's off limits!

195
00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:50.817
Sorry.

196
00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:51.887
Hey, mister.

197
00:11:52.307 --> 00:11:55.897
The belt around these boxes is
loose. They're about to fall over.

198
00:11:55.897 --> 00:11:56.937
It's what?

199
00:11:57.527 --> 00:12:00.047
Damn it. Must've been those part-timers.

200
00:12:00.047 --> 00:12:01.687
I'll have to give them a talking to later.

201
00:12:01.957 --> 00:12:04.817
Those? There's more than one of them?

202
00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:06.277
Yeah.

203
00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:09.237
One of them lifts boxes using that crane,

204
00:12:09.797 --> 00:12:12.617
and the other stacks and
secures them in place.

205
00:12:12.937 --> 00:12:15.617
It takes at least two people.

206
00:12:16.487 --> 00:12:17.837
Two people?

207
00:12:18.377 --> 00:12:22.217
I told you, that brooch has been
missing since a few days ago!

208
00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:23.377
I've been looking for it!

209
00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:27.507
But you tried to hide the letter.

210
00:12:27.507 --> 00:12:30.547
Because I didn't want to become a suspect!

211
00:12:30.807 --> 00:12:36.367
I heard you were the runner-up
at an audition for a commercial.

212
00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:38.557
If something happened to Ayaka-san...

213
00:12:38.697 --> 00:12:41.317
N-No. I didn't do it!

214
00:12:44.737 --> 00:12:47.567
What? You want to confirm my alibi?

215
00:12:47.817 --> 00:12:50.947
Yeah. Do you know who Mori Kogoro is?

216
00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:52.287
The great detective.

217
00:12:52.287 --> 00:12:54.287
He wants to know.

218
00:12:59.307 --> 00:13:03.957
Yuko-chan was in the green
room with me when it happened.

219
00:13:04.357 --> 00:13:06.837
So you didn't go to that storage room.

220
00:13:07.097 --> 00:13:10.337
Nope. I haven't been there
once this afternoon.

221
00:13:11.327 --> 00:13:13.847
Detective Mori is asking about my alibi?

222
00:13:14.057 --> 00:13:17.897
Yeah. You said you went to watch the concert.

223
00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:20.857
He was wondering if there was
anyone who could vouch for you.

224
00:13:21.157 --> 00:13:24.597
I know the receptionist.

225
00:13:24.597 --> 00:13:26.267
You should ask her about it.

226
00:13:37.677 --> 00:13:39.977
They both have alibis.

227
00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:42.767
I guess it's not related after all.

228
00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:44.567
But...

229
00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:47.897
Conan-kun, there you are.

230
00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:49.377
We're leaving.

231
00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:50.367
Okay.

232
00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:53.147
No. I didn't do it!

233
00:13:53.147 --> 00:13:55.327
I didn't push Ayaka!

234
00:13:55.327 --> 00:13:56.147
Now, now. You can tell us
the rest at the station.
I didn't push Ayaka!

235
00:13:56.147 --> 00:13:58.257
Now, now. You can tell us
the rest at the station.

236
00:14:07.277 --> 00:14:10.507
I see. So that's how it is.

237
00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:21.074
Please believe me!

238
00:14:21.074 --> 00:14:22.674
I really didn't do it!

239
00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.424
In any case, you can tell us the rest at—

240
00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:27.674
Sonoko?

241
00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:37.184
Are you okay, Sonoko-neechan?

242
00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.074
I'm fine.

243
00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:43.564
I'm just feeling a little dizzy
because I figured it all out.

244
00:14:43.564 --> 00:14:44.494
What?

245
00:14:44.494 --> 00:14:46.314
Y-You know who did it?

246
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:47.864
Yes, that's right.

247
00:14:47.864 --> 00:14:49.074
In order to confirm my suspicions,

248
00:14:49.074 --> 00:14:53.324
could you go up to the second floor
where Ayaka-san fell, Detective Takagi?

249
00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:58.584
What are you having Takagi-kun confirm?

250
00:14:58.974 --> 00:15:02.664
There were two tricks set
up inside this storage room.

251
00:15:02.664 --> 00:15:04.334
Two tricks?

252
00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:10.344
The first was applied to the
scaffolding that made Ayaka-san fall.

253
00:15:10.484 --> 00:15:12.904
And the second was...

254
00:15:12.904 --> 00:15:13.844
Sonoko-san.

255
00:15:14.044 --> 00:15:15.524
I've arrived.

256
00:15:15.524 --> 00:15:18.104
See the boxes stacked there?

257
00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:20.454
Don't they seem unsteady,
like they're about to fall over?

258
00:15:21.764 --> 00:15:24.704
You're right. It's dangerous.

259
00:15:24.704 --> 00:15:27.984
And where was Mai-san's brooch?

260
00:15:28.224 --> 00:15:29.734
In front of the boxes.

261
00:15:30.214 --> 00:15:33.014
What about that, Sonoko-kun?

262
00:15:33.014 --> 00:15:37.994
Detective Takagi, could you look at the
clasp on the belt securing those boxes?

263
00:15:38.884 --> 00:15:42.144
There's some kind of
paint or something on it.

264
00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:44.464
Is there anything on the floor nearby?

265
00:15:47.884 --> 00:15:48.674
I found something!

266
00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:50.524
What is this?

267
00:15:53.294 --> 00:15:54.674
Is it an artificial nail?

268
00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:56.694
That's Ayaka's.

269
00:15:57.994 --> 00:16:01.934
The body was missing one of its nails.

270
00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:03.224
In other words,

271
00:16:03.224 --> 00:16:08.064
based on what we just confirmed and
Mai-san's testimony relating to her brooch...

272
00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:11.754
I told you, that brooch has been
missing since a few days ago!

273
00:16:11.754 --> 00:16:13.074
I've been looking for it!

274
00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:17.914
And in conjunction with the letter
Ayaka-san wrote to Mai-san...

275
00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:18.494
That's it!

276
00:16:19.184 --> 00:16:22.834
Ayaka-san stole Mai-san's
brooch and left it here.

277
00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:25.194
She summoned Mai-san here with that letter

278
00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:30.214
and planned to send her and the scaffolding
crashing to the floor by knocking over the boxes.

279
00:16:31.184 --> 00:16:32.344
No...

280
00:16:32.694 --> 00:16:34.324
Ayaka was going to kill me?

281
00:16:34.814 --> 00:16:39.184
But something made her lose her footing
on the scaffolding she tampered with

282
00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:40.754
and she fell.

283
00:16:40.754 --> 00:16:41.694
Wrong.

284
00:16:41.694 --> 00:16:42.604
What?

285
00:16:42.754 --> 00:16:44.354
Th-That's wrong?

286
00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:48.604
Boxes can't be stacked on the
second floor without two people.

287
00:16:49.144 --> 00:16:53.864
One lifts the boxes using the crane,
while the other stacks them up.

288
00:16:54.344 --> 00:16:57.744
In other words, someone
was controlling the crane.

289
00:16:58.264 --> 00:17:03.874
An evil seal who incited Ayaka-san and
got her caught up in this murder plot.

290
00:17:04.144 --> 00:17:06.524
They incited Ayaka-san?

291
00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:08.124
Yes. For example...

292
00:17:08.904 --> 00:17:13.214
"She's planning to injure you
and steal your commercial job."

293
00:17:13.214 --> 00:17:15.884
"She did the same thing to me
before and took one of mine."

294
00:17:16.144 --> 00:17:20.084
"At this rate, she'll continue to
escalate, and harm the two of us."

295
00:17:20.564 --> 00:17:22.894
"We should kill Mai-san together."

296
00:17:23.684 --> 00:17:28.394
Then the evil seal instructed
Ayaka-san to do the following.

297
00:17:29.044 --> 00:17:31.654
"Write a letter to Mai-san inviting
her to the storage room."

298
00:17:31.654 --> 00:17:35.904
"Leave this brooch I stole from
her in front of the boxes."

299
00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:41.244
"Once Mai-san comes to the second floor,
she'll spot her brooch and approach."

300
00:17:41.244 --> 00:17:45.144
"Then I'll push the boxes onto her
from behind, and she'll fall."

301
00:17:45.144 --> 00:17:46.974
"It'll look like an accident."

302
00:17:46.974 --> 00:17:50.344
"During that time,
you'll go fabricate an alibi."

303
00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:57.144
I see. But it was Ayaka-san,
not Mai-san, who ended up dead.

304
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.774
Something must've made her fall from
the scaffolding she tampered with.

305
00:17:59.774 --> 00:18:02.324
You're wrong, Inspector Megure.

306
00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:06.134
It was the evil seal who
tampered with the scaffolding.

307
00:18:06.134 --> 00:18:10.764
Ayaka-san climbed the scaffolding
without realizing that and fell.

308
00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:11.444
What?

309
00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:17.824
The true goal of this murder
plot was to kill Ayaka-san.

310
00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:24.754
But if killing Ayaka-san was their only goal,

311
00:18:24.754 --> 00:18:26.874
why bother with this troublesome trick?

312
00:18:27.284 --> 00:18:31.534
This trick was bait meant
to draw in Ayaka-san.

313
00:18:31.534 --> 00:18:32.544
Bait?

314
00:18:32.734 --> 00:18:35.844
If they had invited Ayaka-san here
with the intention of murdering her,

315
00:18:35.844 --> 00:18:38.734
it could have left behind evidence,

316
00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:43.184
or Ayaka-san herself could
have told someone about it.

317
00:18:43.404 --> 00:18:48.494
But by luring Ayaka-san into
a fake plot to murder Mai-san,

318
00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:51.424
they didn't have to worry
about her telling anyone.

319
00:18:51.424 --> 00:18:55.214
Furthermore, the odds that suspicion
would fall on the evil seal

320
00:18:55.214 --> 00:18:57.194
would be reduced to nearly nothing.

321
00:18:57.434 --> 00:18:58.564
That's it!

322
00:18:58.564 --> 00:19:03.104
The letter to Mai-san was
proof of their quarrel,

323
00:19:03.104 --> 00:19:08.024
and as the first person to discover the
body, suspicion would fall on Mai-san first.

324
00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:14.464
And the brooch at the crime scene would seem
like evidence that Mai-san was the culprit.

325
00:19:16.484 --> 00:19:20.364
But, Sonoko-kun, how did this
evil seal get Ayaka-san

326
00:19:20.364 --> 00:19:24.684
to climb the scaffolding
that had been tampered with?

327
00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:26.224
Well... Conan-kun?

328
00:19:26.404 --> 00:19:27.594
Here.

329
00:19:29.854 --> 00:19:33.104
Wow, there are lots of stuffed seals.

330
00:19:33.304 --> 00:19:35.134
Stuffed seals?

331
00:19:35.134 --> 00:19:37.104
What about them?

332
00:19:37.464 --> 00:19:41.504
Those stuffed animals can apparently
be controlled using a smartphone.

333
00:19:41.504 --> 00:19:42.484
So...

334
00:19:42.844 --> 00:19:47.114
They told Ayaka-san exactly
when to place the brooch there,

335
00:19:47.114 --> 00:19:48.644
and at that time...

336
00:19:59.154 --> 00:20:00.504
Excuse me.

337
00:20:00.964 --> 00:20:03.224
In order to control those stuffed animals,

338
00:20:03.224 --> 00:20:06.574
you need to register it on your phone.

339
00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:07.594
That's right.

340
00:20:07.594 --> 00:20:10.424
The stuffed animals over
there haven't been sold yet,

341
00:20:10.424 --> 00:20:12.014
so they can't be controlled using a phone.

342
00:20:12.014 --> 00:20:13.434
Huh?

343
00:20:14.034 --> 00:20:16.854
This seal has a stain on it.

344
00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:18.854
Is it a coffee stain?

345
00:20:20.254 --> 00:20:25.364
Ran, do you remember what happened
when we were in the green room?

346
00:20:26.554 --> 00:20:29.574
God, you're so annoying!

347
00:20:32.514 --> 00:20:33.964
Yuko...

348
00:20:33.964 --> 00:20:35.454
Did you...?

349
00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:40.964
Yuko-san, you said you hadn't
been here once all afternoon.

350
00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:44.884
So why is that stuffed animal here?

351
00:20:45.484 --> 00:20:51.524
And if we examine your phone, we'll
find that stuffed animal registered to it.

352
00:20:52.524 --> 00:20:59.604
She stole the man I loved
and tossed him aside.

353
00:20:59.944 --> 00:21:03.364
He killed himself because of it.

354
00:21:04.034 --> 00:21:07.494
So I avenged him.

355
00:21:08.304 --> 00:21:10.864
B-But why frame me?

356
00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:13.244
I'm sorry, Mai-san.

357
00:21:13.244 --> 00:21:15.374
It could've been anyone.

358
00:21:15.714 --> 00:21:19.734
Anyone who might've argued with her.

359
00:21:21.334 --> 00:21:22.474
Are we really doing this?

360
00:21:22.474 --> 00:21:25.384
Yeah. After all, she's bad news.

361
00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.244
If we're doing this, now's our chance.

362
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:31.224
But if someone finds out,
we'll both be arrested.

363
00:21:31.224 --> 00:21:36.164
Nah. Our alibis are perfect, and
I'll be the one to finish her off.

364
00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:39.894
Got it. Let's kill Mai, then.

365
00:21:40.454 --> 00:21:44.904
First, you'll trip me in front of everyone.

366
00:21:45.244 --> 00:21:47.834
After making Mai angry,

367
00:21:47.834 --> 00:21:50.234
I'll send her a letter
saying I want to apologize

368
00:21:50.234 --> 00:21:52.344
and have her come to the storage room.

369
00:23:18.784 --> 00:23:19.814
Here you go.

370
00:23:19.814 --> 00:23:21.374
Thank you.

371
00:23:21.584 --> 00:23:22.764
They're flying off the shelves.

372
00:23:22.764 --> 00:23:23.874
Thank you.

373
00:23:23.874 --> 00:23:27.134
Thank you for even putting
on the idol outfit.

374
00:23:27.414 --> 00:23:29.884
Don't worry about it.

375
00:23:29.884 --> 00:23:31.634
Impressive as always, Ran-neechan.

376
00:23:31.634 --> 00:23:35.634
Sonoko-san, thank you for helping, too.

377
00:23:38.474 --> 00:23:39.854
You're welcome.

378
00:23:39.854 --> 00:23:41.644
This costume sure is hot.

379
00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:44.464
I'm impressed, Detective Queen Sonoko.

380
00:23:44.464 --> 00:23:46.234
You look good in anything.

381
00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:48.194
You're next, kid. Here!

382
00:23:48.194 --> 00:23:49.654
Wait, wait, wait!
