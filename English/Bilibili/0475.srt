1
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,291
The light of summer is the brilliance of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,291
After the tears, comes the change in life.

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:07,791
How can a man be so unlucky?

4
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,591
An incident endangering his life occurs.

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:11,291
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,091
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,391
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,334
Strange.

9
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:05,634
I'm sure that the yakiniku shop was on this road somewhere.

10
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,034
It's okay already.

11
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,634
Let's go eat something else.

12
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:10,334
Shut up!

13
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:11,734
We're looking for it one more time.

14
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:12,834
What?

15
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,634
We're going to look for it again?

16
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,534
Let's go home, Pops.

17
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:20,734
We can't find it and it's already 6:30 pm.

18
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,434
It's only 6:30 pm!

19
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,734
I told you that I'd treat you to a luxurious meal while Ran is away.

20
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,034
It's a hit-and-run!

21
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,134
Hey! Hold it!

22
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,834
Somebody! Somebody call the police!

23
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,534
You idiot!

24
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:38,234
We need an ambulance right away!

25
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:41,434
Two passers-by have been hit by a car.

26
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,934
The place is at a backstreet of Beika Park.

27
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,034
Hurry!

28
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,034
He looks familiar.

29
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,134
He's the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

30
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,534
The unluckiest man in all of Japan?

31
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,834
Just some time ago, a video of him taken by his nephew

32
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,934
got the "Funniest Video Award" which was aired on TV.

33
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:05,334
My uncle, Mr. Shinzaburo Tatematsu,

34
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:08,834
is probably the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

35
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,834
When he walks, a lot of things come falling down at him.

36
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:16,634
When he tries to avoid danger, he always sprains his ankle.

37
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,134
That hurts...

38
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:19,534
If he lines up to get something,

39
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,634
-it will always runs out right before of him. -I'm so sorry.

40
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,634
Why does everything bad happen to me?

41
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:38,034
And now he ends up in a traffic accident.

42
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,634
No, that's not it!

43
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:42,934
That's not it?

44
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:47,534
The driver was waiting for them in the car for a while there.

45
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,034
And the moment the driver saw those two,

46
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:52,334
the car charged right at them.

47
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,434
What?

48
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,634
Then, this wasn't just a mere accident.

49
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,534
It's an attempted murder case.

50
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:08,634
"Bad Luck Grand Prix"

51
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,934
One of the witnesses happened to remember the license plate number.

52
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,934
It seems to have been a stolen car.

53
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,834
It hasn't been found yet.

54
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:21,334
And how about the victims?

55
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,934
It seems that they're both okay.

56
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:25,234
I'm glad.

57
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,834
Can you share me the details?

58
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,134
Yes.

59
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,134
According to the eyewitness,

60
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:32,834
he doesn't know what the culprit looks like

61
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,534
because he's wearing a cap and sunglasses.

62
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:37,134
Mr. Tatematsu who was on his way back from work

63
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,034
was coming from Beika Station.

64
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:42,934
Just when he met Mr. Okonogi who was taking a walk...

65
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:46,734
The car in waiting suddenly ambushed them.

66
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:54,534
Who was the car after at that time? Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?

67
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,534
We don't know.

68
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,934
The car seems to charge at those two the instant they met each other.

69
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:03,634
Huh? Then, maybe the culprit was after them both?

70
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:05,534
I don't know about that.

71
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,534
If the culprit really wanted to go after the lives of both of them,

72
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,234
targeting them one by one instead of two together

73
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,834
will heighten the success rate.

74
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:13,834
True.

75
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:18,234
Only one of them was the target after all.

76
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,434
Then why did the culprit charge at them at such queer timing?

77
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,734
Doctor.

78
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:31,034
Let's confirm with the two men whether they have any idea

79
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,334
of anyone who could be coming after them.

80
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,334
Thank you very much.

81
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,834
I think we'll be able to hear what Mr. Tatematsu has to say.

82
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,934
But as for Mr. Okonogi...

83
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,934
Is uncle okay?

84
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:46,334
You are...

85
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:50,034
He is Mr. Kazuma Sakaki, Mr. Okonogi's nephew.

86
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,234
His nephew.

87
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,634
And she is his fiance.

88
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,334
My name is Tomomi Ichikura.

89
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,734
I was contacted by Kazuma and was shocked.

90
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,534
Thank you for coming.

91
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,834
It seems that he will be all right,

92
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:05,834
but it will take a while before he regains consciousness.

93
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:08,134
Who could've done such a thing to Mr. Okonogi?

94
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,634
That's right. Who on earth did it?

95
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,134
Officer Takagi.

96
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,334
There is something that bothers me.

97
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,934
It seems that Mr. Okonogi is a man of great financial standing.

98
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:23,534
However, he doesn't have any family and his only relative is his nephew.

99
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,734
Which means...

100
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:25,934
Yeah.

101
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:29,934
If Mr. Okonogi dies, all of his estate will go to his nephew.

102
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,134
Besides,

103
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:34,534
he seemed to have borrowed a lot of money from his uncle, too.

104
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,134
This evening at about 6:30 pm,

105
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:41,234
when Mr. Okonogi was hit by the car,

106
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,234
where were you, Mr. Sakaki?

107
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,034
-Are you suspecting me? -No way!

108
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:49,334
Now, now. Please calm down.

109
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:54,534
I'm sure the culprit was after the other man!

110
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:57,634
Mr. Okonogi just happened to get involved.

111
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,634
At any rate, the police have to confirm

112
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:04,634
everyone's alibi that is close to Mr. Okonogi.

113
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,134
Please give us your cooperation, Mr. Sakaki and Ms. Ichikura.

114
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:13,234
I was in my condo.

115
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,434
Huh?

116
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,734
Is something the matter, Ms. Ichikura?

117
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:21,534
Well, I thought he went to attend his company superior's farewell party.

118
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,634
I was planning to,

119
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,434
but I wasn't feeling too well,

120
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:27,534
so I took off from work in the afternoon.

121
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,534
I came home and slept right through.

122
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,234
Since I live alone, I have no one to verify this though.

123
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:37,534
And will you tell us where you were too, Ms. Ichikura?

124
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:38,734
What?

125
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:39,734
Yes.

126
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:44,534
I was window shopping at Tohto Department Store in Ginza from 5:00 pm

127
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:50,134
and I went outside to go home about 6:30 pm.

128
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,134
Were you with anyone?

129
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:53,134
No.

130
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:57,734
I was alone too, so there is no one who can confirm this.

131
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,834
But there was a bit of a commotion back then.

132
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:01,934
A commotion?

133
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:05,134
Yes. So I mailed Kazuma about it.

134
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,434
That's right. I remember.

135
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:13,534
Let's see...

136
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,734
Oh, here it is.

137
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,734
A time bomb?

138
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,934
Okumura, do you know about this case?

139
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,234
No. I'll go check.

140
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,634
Huh? What's this?

141
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,134
Mr. Mouri.

142
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:28,034
Show that to me.

143
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,134
"I'm at Tohto Department Store now.

144
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:35,134
They said a time bomb was found in the women's restroom on the 5th floor.

145
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:36,734
Talk about scary."

146
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,934
I see. Understood.

147
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,434
There's no doubt about it.

148
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,634
At about 6:30 pm, a suspicious looking thing was found in the restroom.

149
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:49,634
There was a commotion where the customers and employees were all evacuated.

150
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,134
It turned out to be a bad prank

151
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:55,234
and the bomb turned out to be an absolute fake, too.

152
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,834
Fake?

153
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,934
You mean that was a prank?

154
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:02,634
And it was found not in the women's restroom on the 5th floor,

155
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,634
but in the men's restroom on the 6th floor.

156
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:05,634
What?

157
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:12,434
Well, it's usual for wrong information to go around during a commotion.

158
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,034
Right...

159
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:16,334
Besides, it doesn't matter if it was on the 5th floor or the 6th,

160
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:19,634
or whether the bomb was a fake or not.

161
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:23,434
It's a fact that there was a bomb scare at 6:30 pm,

162
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:27,834
and she had notified him of this incident at 6:40 pm.

163
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,934
This means that she was there at the time.

164
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:35,034
And to get from Tohto Department Store to Beikacho,

165
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,434
it would take at least an hour even at top speed.

166
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,834
In other words...

167
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:43,834
A coincidental bomb scare established your alibi.

168
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,934
You must be a lucky woman.

169
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,134
True.

170
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:48,934
By the way, Mr. Sakaki,

171
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:52,334
you owe Mr. Okonogi a lot of money, don't you?

172
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,434
Excuse me.

173
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,834
You're police officers, right?

174
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,134
Mr. Tatematsu?

175
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,034
Then, you must be the other victim?

176
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,534
That car...

177
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:09,534
That car tried to run me over to shut me up.

178
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:10,834
Shut you up?

179
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,434
What?

180
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,834
The day before yesterday was pay day.

181
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,834
I thought I'd go out once in a while and went to a supermarket nearby.

182
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,834
I bought expensive meat and sashimi.

183
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,134
However, as soon as I went outside,

184
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,534
I was mugged.

185
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:28,934
Afer that, I tried to go after the culprit...

186
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,834
and I broke my front teeth.

187
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,334
Talk about one disaster after the other.

188
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:41,534
You really are an unlucky guy.

189
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:44,634
I knew you looked familiar.

190
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:48,234
You appeared on TV once as the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

191
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,734
Yeah, everybody was watching it.

192
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,934
But that isn't the end of the story yet.

193
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:59,134
Last night, I received a call from that mugger.

194
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:01,834
How dare you report to the police.

195
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:05,534
I can't let you go alive since you have seen my face.

196
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,834
I'm going to shut you up forever.

197
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,534
Warning of murder?

198
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,634
And then today, just as the culprit warned...

199
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,734
But would a person who only mugged food,

200
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:19,534
go all out as to carry out a murder?

201
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,834
He's right.

202
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:21,934
But...

203
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:23,934
But it was the same guy!

204
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,234
The same guy?

205
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,734
Then, that's it.

206
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:33,734
The mugger tried to kill him to shut him up.

207
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,834
Yes.

208
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,334
Hey, I'm going to go check on uncle's condition.

209
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:38,434
Okay.

210
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:48,434
I wonder if this case is really that simple.

211
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,934
Mr. Tatematsu.

212
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:54,934
Are you acquainted with that man called Mr. Okonogi?

213
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,134
I didn't know what his name was,

214
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,034
but I see him there every morning.

215
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,934
I come home on the same train every day

216
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:05,734
and he also take his walks at the same time.

217
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,734
Please tell us more in detail

218
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:10,034
about the time you were mugged last night.

219
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:12,834
And also about the call you received last night.

220
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,834
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,534
Hey, we're going home!

222
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:19,834
We've figured out the culprit, so the rest is up to the police.

223
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,934
Something...

224
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:26,034
Something's not right.

225
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:29,934
"The next morning"

226
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:33,034
The point is the timing of the car that charged towards them.

227
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,634
If the car was actually after Mr. Tatematsu's life,

228
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:38,334
it would've been better to target him when he was alone.

229
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,734
Why did it have to be then?

230
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:40,934
Hey, kid!

231
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:43,034
Pops.

232
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,734
What do you want so early in the morning?

233
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:48,734
Kids should keep their noses out of what's not their business.

234
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,534
I'm going to stop over at the hospital for a while.

235
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,234
Go home, understand?

236
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,034
Did something come up?

237
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:02,334
Yeah. That unluckiest man in all of Japan was really depressed.

238
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:07,134
He felt responsible for getting Mr. Okonogi involved in the accident.

239
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,634
So I thought I'd go encourage him a bit.

240
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,434
You're nice, Pops.

241
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:14,134
Silly!

242
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:16,134
I'm always very nice!

243
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:18,434
Got him involved?

244
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,834
Maybe it's the other way around?

245
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:25,534
If the culprit schemed the whole thing just to make it look that way,

246
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,034
everything falls into place.

247
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:31,734
If so, there must be somebody who saw the culprit!

248
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,043
Mr. Tatematsu?

249
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:48,943
Yes, only for these past few days though.

250
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:51,443
Let me see...

251
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:52,443
Was there anyone?

252
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,943
I wonder if she followed Mr. Tatematsu here.

253
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:57,443
There was a suspicious looking person.

254
00:13:57,443 --> 00:14:01,043
Was that person a bit short and plump?

255
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,343
Nope.

256
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,143
She was a beautiful lady.

257
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,743
A lady?

258
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:07,543
I thought it was his girlfriend at first,

259
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:11,243
but it's so unlike of Mr. Tatematsu.

260
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,043
A lady?

261
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:14,143
Exactly.

262
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:17,443
It was no coincidence that the bomb was found.

263
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:21,343
At about 6:30 pm, an anonymous call was received at Tohto Department Store.

264
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,943
The person said that a time bomb was set in the restroom.

265
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:26,943
Was the bomb set in the women's restroom on the 5th floor?

266
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:28,743
It's surprising you know.

267
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,643
We haven't made it public because it's a secret investigation.

268
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:35,143
It seems that a child who came shopping,

269
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:38,243
moved it to the men's restroom on the 6th floor out of fun,

270
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,643
unaware that it was a fake bomb.

271
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:42,443
So that's the story.

272
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,043
I see the entire picture now.

273
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:48,943
Mr. Sakaki!

274
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,043
It's the kid from yesterday.

275
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:52,543
How's Mr. Okonogi?

276
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:55,743
We don't know when he'll regain consciousness,

277
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,943
so we decided to take turns and eat our meal.

278
00:14:57,943 --> 00:15:01,943
Which means, only Mr. Okonogi and Ms. Ichikura are in the room together.

279
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:04,243
What is it?

280
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:05,243
We've got to hurry!

281
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,343
What's up, kid?

282
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:07,343
Hey, hold it!

283
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:16,243
The case has been solved?

284
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:17,843
You said to come right away.

285
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,943
Did I say that? Me?

286
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:22,043
That's why we all rushed over here.

287
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:26,243
If I said so but don't remember, I may have a multiple character.

288
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:27,443
I went to check!

289
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:31,143
It was just as you said, Pops!

290
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,143
Did I say something to you, too?

291
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,343
So, hurry!

292
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,443
Hey!

293
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,843
What are you doing?

294
00:15:58,743 --> 00:15:59,743
What...

295
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,643
What are you doing, Tomomi?

296
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:04,143
Just what is going on, Mr. Mouri?

297
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,543
-Mr. Mouri? -Me?

298
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,743
I mean, what am I supposed to say at such an unexpected situation?

299
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:15,943
The door of multiple personality is starting to open.

300
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,143
Did it come?

301
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:21,743
Ms. Ichikura.

302
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:26,343
Were you trying to make it look as if he had difficulty breathing

303
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:30,143
after drowning him with that wet towel?

304
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:35,643
Because you failed to kill him after the hit-and-run yesterday.

305
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:41,143
But as to yesterday's case, Ms. Ichikura has an alibi.

306
00:16:41,143 --> 00:16:45,143
The one who came charging with the car is the one who mugged me.

307
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:50,243
Ms. Ichikura planned all this out.

308
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:56,443
To begin with, the person the culprit was after is Mr. Okonogi.

309
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,343
What?

310
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:02,743
Mr. Tatematsu, you were exploited by the culprit.

311
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,343
I was exploited?

312
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:09,143
Ms. Ichikura schemed to kill Mr. Okonogi.

313
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,643
But with just a simple murder plan,

314
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:14,543
she knew she could fall under suspicion.

315
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:16,943
She was thinking of a good way to work things out

316
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:20,143
and began watching Mr. Okonogi's daily life.

317
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:29,743
She finds out that he always passes by Mr. Tatematsu while taking a walk.

318
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:33,843
Ms. Ichikura remembered Mr. Tatematsu's face.

319
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,843
He was the unluckiest man in all of Japan.

320
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:39,343
She had seen him on TV.

321
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:40,543
At that time,

322
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:46,143
Ms. Ichikura probably thought up this plan of exploiting Mr. Tatematsu.

323
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,043
So she followed him.

324
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,443
She may have known his face from watching him on TV,

325
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:54,743
but she didn't know his name.

326
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:57,243
In order to find out, she...

327
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,843
I made Conan go and confirm it.

328
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:02,643
It turns out that a person living in the same apartment remembered it.

329
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:07,143
She said a suspicious lady followed him on his way home from work.

330
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:09,643
You carried out your plan.

331
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:12,243
First, you mugged Mr. Tatematsu.

332
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,543
Was that you?

333
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,343
The following day,

334
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:18,743
you got his phone number from his name and address

335
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:22,843
and called Mr. Tatematsu to warn him that you'd kill him to shut him up.

336
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,143
Then you chose yesterday to carry out the crime

337
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:27,743
because you knew that Mr. Sakaki was going to a farewell party

338
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:32,743
and would have a definite alibi, so he wouldn't be suspected.

339
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:35,443
You put a fake time bomb in the women's restroom

340
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,843
on the 5th floor of the Tohto Department Store.

341
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:46,043
After that, you rushed over to Beikacho.

342
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,643
Just as you warned, you executed your plan of fake killing Mr. Tatematsu.

343
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:52,043
You made it look as if Mr. Okonogi coincidentally happened

344
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:55,943
to get involved in the accident and tried to kill him.

345
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:59,243
You called Tohto Department Store right away.

346
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:03,843
I set a time bomb in the women's restroom on the 5th floor.

347
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,943
If you don't hurry, it'll explode.

348
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,443
You sent your fiance the mail

349
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:11,643
just about the time you figured the bomb would be found

350
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:13,743
and a commotion would be taking place.

351
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:18,543
Isn't that right, Ms. Ichikura?

352
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:23,443
But the alibi scheme that you thought up got the better of you.

353
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:25,543
The contradiction between where the fake bomb was actually found

354
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,743
and the contents of your mail.

355
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:31,443
That's what concluded the suspicion towards you.

356
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:34,543
Tomomi.

357
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,243
Well...

358
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:40,443
It's all so stupid.

359
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:48,243
I wonder why it was moved from the place I put it.

360
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:51,443
Tomomi...

361
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:56,443
-You... -It seems that a child who came shopping moved it.

362
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,843
This world just isn't fair.

363
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:04,843
The bomb is moved.

364
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:08,043
The man I tried to kill is alive.

365
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,543
And now a famed detective comes along.

366
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,143
Maybe I'm even more unlucky than you.

367
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:16,743
Why'd you try to kill uncle?

368
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:18,043
Because...

369
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,943
I wanted the money.

370
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:27,943
I decided to marry you in the first place

371
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,843
because I figured if your rich uncle dies,

372
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:32,143
I could get a hold of his estate.

373
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,643
But your uncle turned out to be so alive and kicking.

374
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:38,343
I just couldn't wait for him to drop dead.

375
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,443
Money?

376
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:42,143
So you were just after the money to begin with!

377
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:43,643
Of course!

378
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,143
Otherwise, I would never go out with somebody like you.

379
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,743
Really...

380
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:55,743
So stupid.

381
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,343
Tomomi?

382
00:20:58,843 --> 00:20:59,943
Uncle!

383
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:04,543
Kazuma.

384
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,043
I'll go get the doctor.

385
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,043
What happened, Tomomi?

386
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,843
I'm glad that you woke up.

387
00:21:45,143 --> 00:21:47,743
What a horrible woman.

388
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:50,143
I think she can start off anew.

389
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,743
Huh?

390
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,543
I know it's strange for a jinx like me to say so.

391
00:21:58,143 --> 00:21:59,243
It's true.

392
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:03,643
I'd like to believe so.

393
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:41,643
Beer in the morning is so delicious!

394
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:44,043
A re-run due to popular demand?

395
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:46,643
So here goes!

396
00:23:52,743 --> 00:23:54,743
Talk about super unlucky!

397
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:01,643
You shouldn't laugh at others, you know.

398
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,543
"Next Episode" -Huh?

399
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:08,543
I have to do it!

400
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:14,643
I think only three of them are suspicious.

401
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:26,043
Genta!

402
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:33,343
Next Conan, "Genta's Knockout Shot (Part 1)"

403
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:51,443
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,443
"Parking validation"

405
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:54,543
I've done it.

406
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:55,543
What did you do?

407
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,043
In the next episode, it's got to be made clear, whether it's red or white.

408
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,243
I think you want to say, whether it's black or white.
