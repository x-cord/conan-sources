1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,640
The moment of vengeance has come!

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,540
The curtains will soon rise.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,940
The masque of death is ready to commence.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,640
A crisis is gracefully revived.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,040
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,840
The malicious intent of an unseen face is frightening.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,040
Tragedy during a Masque performance.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,740
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

11
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:26,962
"The Malice Hidden Behind the Masque"

12
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,462
Masque...

13
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:38,562
"The Triumph of Folly" -in other words, a masque is a play

14
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:40,562
that used to be popular in England

15
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:43,462
in the days before Shakespeare.

16
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,362
The play that's being performed right now is John Benson's

17
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,262
"The Triumph of Folly".

18
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,162
"Shimizu Kinuko (26)" -In Japanese...

19
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:04,162
"Troupe Company Manager" -Orokasa (folly) no Shouri(triumph).

20
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:06,162
I see.

21
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:15,062
You know, this performance is really something.

22
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,362
We borrowed...

23
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,262
"Manabu Tabuchi (50)" -genuine rapiers to practice with.

24
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,562
No dialog?

25
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:01,162
Yes.

26
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:02,762
It's silent play.

27
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,862
I see.

28
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:14,762
He vanished?

29
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:17,362
There's a landing below the veranda

30
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:19,362
and he jumped down.

31
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:30,662
And this scene is?

32
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,062
This is a scene in which the two unwanted characters, the prince

33
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,562
and the minister die,

34
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,962
and the king raises his cup in celebration.

35
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:39,062
Of course, it was the king who orchestrated

36
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,762
the feud between the two.

37
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,762
The wine the king was just drank

38
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,762
was poisoned by the minister beforehand.

39
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:18,862
What a bloody story.

40
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:20,462
The story is indeed bloody,

41
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:22,962
but the play itself is also said to be cursed.

42
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:24,562
Just what do you mean?

43
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:27,162
They say that ever since the first performance in the 17th century,

44
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,562
this play has been cursed

45
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,962
and somebody involved in the play is destined to die.

46
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:41,562
The guy playing the prince really looks like a prince, doesn't he?

47
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:43,762
"Robert Banno (21)" -That is our star actor,

48
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:46,562
called Robert Banno.

49
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:53,062
Oh, that's Hiroshi Komazuka!

50
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,462
-Dad, do you know him? -Yeah.

51
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,162
"Hiroshi Komazuka (50)" -Back when I was a student,

52
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,662
I used to watch his movies all the time.

53
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,562
The one playing the minister is Atsushi Yabuki.

54
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,862
"Atsushi Yabuki (28)" -As for the lift I'll be taking a plunge for,

55
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:10,262
could you raise the platform a bit more?

56
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,062
The fact is, during practice suspicious happenings

57
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:14,462
have occurred one after the other.

58
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:17,362
That's why we called on you, Detective Mouri.

59
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:19,262
Leave it to me!

60
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:22,862
It shall be as easy as relaxing on a boat... No, I mean a cruise liner.

61
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:49,062
Well, no problem at all.

62
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,962
Where is that kid go?

63
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:56,462
Conan!

64
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,762
It's such a big place, he could have gotten lost.

65
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:00,462
I'll go find him.

66
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,162
That kid is such a pain.

67
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:18,662
By switching this rapier with the real one.

68
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,562
Robert will...

69
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:32,262
Kyoko, I don't know where you are now,

70
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:35,462
but make sure you watch tomorrow's news.

71
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:38,662
Because there will be a news coverage of the accidental death

72
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:41,262
of the man who had his fling with you!

73
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,762
Robert. Come tomorrow, the sword of justice

74
00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:51,062
shall pierce right through your sinful heart!

75
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,862
Who... who are you?

76
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,362
Hello. Good-bye!

77
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,462
Hold on!

78
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:08,562
You're Detective Mouri's...

79
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:10,562
I didn't hear a thing.

80
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:13,062
There's no way you didn't hear anything.

81
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:16,462
Now that you've heard, there's no way I can let you go.

82
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,162
At least until the show is finished.

83
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,662
Stay put right here.

84
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:38,462
Darn. My alcoholism is acting up again.

85
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,362
Hi.

86
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,362
Anything?

87
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:13,862
Have you seen a child about this tall?

88
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:16,562
Haven't seen him.

89
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,762
Is that so? Sorry for the trouble.

90
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,162
There we go.

91
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,262
That's right.

92
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,362
The real rapier is missing.

93
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,962
Rapier?

94
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:47,162
Could it be...

95
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,362
How dangerous!

96
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:55,662
Darn it! I'm going tell them off!

97
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:59,962
No, wait a second.

98
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:02,762
Rather than shocking him to death on the stage lift,

99
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:05,162
maybe this way I can be sure to kill him.

100
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,762
I'm not the one who mistook the rapiers,

101
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:11,262
so I can claim it was an accident.

102
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,262
Now, the problem is

103
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:15,762
how to switch roles before the real performance begins.

104
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,562
He'll definitely take the bait.

105
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,862
All right, I'll talk him into it.

106
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:23,062
What?

107
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,262
You don't have money to pay me back,

108
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,062
so you're giving me your role?

109
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:27,362
My apologies.

110
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,762
There's just no way I can get the money ready.

111
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,562
As such, I'm giving you my role.

112
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:33,262
Don't be stupid.

113
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,962
It's just before the performance, you know.

114
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:39,162
Hold it. This is a silent play,

115
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,962
I guess I can somehow handle it because there is no dialog.

116
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,462
Rather... All right.

117
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:46,462
I'll take it.

118
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,862
Well, hurry and tell the manager.

119
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:52,362
Why don't we keep it as a surprise until encore?

120
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:56,062
In view of performance, I think it would be more interesting.

121
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,162
I guess so.

122
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,062
Let's go with it.

123
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,162
I'll just leave this here.

124
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,462
I want to undo the trap.

125
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:16,062
No, so long as I fall to the side,

126
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,262
I should be fine.

127
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,962
Conan, where are you?

128
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:30,162
Even elephants are said to die with this.

129
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,662
So, as for that old man, he doesn't stand a chance.

130
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:36,562
A gift from the fans?

131
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,662
Yes.

132
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,362
But, I don't drink...

133
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:47,062
Well, I guess I'll have some, after all.

134
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:53,562
-Mr. Komazaki, is everything going OK? -Yeah.

135
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:56,562
Please, Robert and Yabuki

136
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,362
are acting their first starring roles,

137
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:01,362
so please do guide them along the way.

138
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,462
Yeah, I got it.

139
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,662
Bye.

140
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:07,662
Just don't do anything foolish

141
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:10,762
that would embarrass me like you did during rehearsal!

142
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:12,662
I'll pay closer attention.

143
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,862
Though you're all too ready to promise,

144
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:17,862
too bad you have zero acting talent.

145
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,562
I'm not even sure how someone like you

146
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:22,162
was allowed to go on the stage.

147
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,862
Put this away.

148
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:27,262
I quit drinking.

149
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:29,162
I understand.

150
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:33,062
What a nag.

151
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:36,462
I would've landed the big role much earlier

152
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:39,562
if it hadn't been for you nagging about this and that's.

153
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:41,862
Hurry up and realize that the audience

154
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:45,162
is sick of watching your mildew ridden act.

155
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:49,362
Well, from the next performance, I'll be the one in the spotlight.

156
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:58,662
What's wrong? Everything will be just fine.

157
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:00,562
I suppose but...

158
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:01,562
Where's Conan?

159
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:04,662
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find him.

160
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:07,262
Could it be that something happened?

161
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:10,862
Nah, no worries, he's always like this.

162
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,862
The moment of vengeance has come!

163
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:23,962
The curtains will soon rise.

164
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:30,362
The masque of death is ready to commence!

165
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,196
You don't have the slightest clue that this performance is about

166
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,096
to become your last.

167
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,196
Everything's okay.

168
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:20,096
Same here.

169
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,896
Conan, where are you?

170
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,296
How did a guy like him...

171
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,796
You said it, didn't you?

172
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,396
My dream is to see out the remainder

173
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,996
of my life on the stage.

174
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:57,196
I'm merely obliging by fulfilling your wish.

175
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:02,396
It's almost the climax.

176
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:05,396
I guess everything will somehow work out okay.

177
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,996
Yeah.

178
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:14,896
That Yabuki seems to really be into it today.

179
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:18,196
Could it be that he performs better during show time?

180
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:20,296
No matter, it'll be in this state that you put a sword

181
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:22,496
right through him.

182
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:27,196
Whatever happens, don't blame me.

183
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:28,296
It's an accident.

184
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,496
The acting of the two look as if they've switched, you say?

185
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,796
Yes.

186
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:35,896
Could I just be imagining things?

187
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:40,296
Yes, that must be it.

188
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:57,496
Your pleas for mercy will be in vain.

189
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,196
What? He shrieked?

190
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:11,096
I did it! I finally did it! I've killed Robert!

191
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:16,796
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:19,496
But it was an accident.

193
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,796
What was that sound just now?

194
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:35,096
What goes around comes around.

195
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:43,896
It would be fantastic if this were actual wine.

196
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,896
Just to be safe, I'll go take a look at the stage lift.

197
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,396
Don't tell me that...

198
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,296
-Dad. -Ran.

199
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,296
He's still alive.

200
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:21,596
Ran, call an ambulance.

201
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:22,796
All right.

202
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:25,596
It's too late.

203
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,296
The poison's already going through his body.

204
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,696
This is the punishment for looking down on me

205
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,696
who knows how many times.

206
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:35,496
But, more importantly who switched the rapier for a real one?

207
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,496
I was the one who did.

208
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:42,696
Robert, that's punishment for making my daughter suffer.

209
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,696
What did you say?

210
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,296
Robert!

211
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,496
Mr. Yabuki!

212
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:55,396
What's going on?

213
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,796
When I found out that the rapier was genuine,

214
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,396
I switched roles with him

215
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,496
in place of repaying him what I owed him.

216
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:05,196
Everything was going fine

217
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:09,496
until I ended up falling into my own trap.

218
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:13,596
Hurry and shut off the power to the lift!

219
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:14,596
All right.

220
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,196
Just what is going on here?

221
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:22,896
Robert.

222
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:24,296
Am I going to die?

223
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,296
A shock that small won't kill you.

224
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,296
Still, we'll need an ambulance!

225
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:39,796
But, when was the rapier switched?

226
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,896
The last time I checked, it was definitely the fake one.

227
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:48,096
It's the fake?

228
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,996
Of course it's the fake.

229
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,196
I was the one who secretly switched them.

230
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,996
And not only that,

231
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:55,996
I weakened the electrical flow,

232
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:58,596
and also switched the wine inside the decanter.

233
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,296
But I really panicked when...

234
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:10,796
Darn it.

235
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,596
After escaping from the coffin,

236
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:18,696
I used the genuine rapier to cut the rope.

237
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:19,996
And...

238
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:25,396
Right. The real rapier is missing.

239
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:32,096
How dangerous!

240
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,496
Darn it! I'm going tell them off!

241
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,796
I believed everything was all right at that point.

242
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:39,296
No, wait a second.

243
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:42,096
Rather than shocking him to death on the stage lift,

244
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:45,396
maybe this way I can be sure to kill him.

245
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,996
I wasn't the one who mistook the rapiers,

246
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:50,496
I can claim it was an accident.

247
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:53,296
Don't tell me that even Robert...

248
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:57,196
In a hurry, I switched it to the prop rapier.

249
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,196
Then, just to be safe, I went to Mr. Yabuki's dressing room,

250
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:01,696
and this time...

251
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:05,196
Even elephants are said to die with this.

252
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,896
So, as for that old man, he doesn't stand a chance.

253
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,796
Dealing with one criminal is relatively simple,

254
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:13,096
but three is too many to handle.

255
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:16,596
And even if they were stopped now, there will be a next time.

256
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,396
So...

257
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,396
I have to save him, even though he's a criminal.

258
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:26,596
Well, I guess I'll take it.

259
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:31,296
-Mr. Komazuka, is everything going OK? -Yeah.

260
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,596
Please, Robert and Yabuki

261
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:36,196
are acting their first starring roles,

262
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:40,396
so please do guide them along the way.

263
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,096
Afterwards, the show began.

264
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:54,396
A bottle cap should be enough.

265
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:02,196
First, make Yabuki lose consciousness.

266
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,596
Next, Robert.

267
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:14,596
Oh, no.

268
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:20,096
And then, Mr. Komazuka.

269
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,996
The evidence is all here,

270
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:45,896
so the three cannot deny what they did.

271
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:51,596
Well, if they'd promise not to do something stupid like this ever again,

272
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,896
and repent what they did, then...

273
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:56,796
Conan!

274
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:59,196
Where were you all this time?

275
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:02,196
Well, the restroom.

276
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,296
I've been looking everywhere for you!

277
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:07,196
I had my reasons too.

278
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:08,796
Apologize.

279
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,896
Yes. I'm sorry.

280
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:35,196
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -You act in a masque, dad?

281
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,796
Can you pull it off?

282
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:38,296
Of course, I can.

283
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,496
"Strange Attempted Murder Scenario" -Well...

284
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,496
"Plays Out At The Theater" -let's give it a try.

285
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:54,796
Is that supposed to be a masque?

286
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:56,296
Yes...

287
00:23:57,596 --> 00:24:02,096
"Next Episode" -I mean, why didn't you ask Pops Kogoro?

288
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:03,496
That's right, that's right!

289
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:06,996
Mom is a lawyer, Dad is a detective!

290
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:09,596
If it is a stalker case, a detective is...

291
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,396
Don't hang up the phone!

292
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,796
Is it this closet?

293
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:27,596
Next Conan, "Might Over Mystery (Part 1)"

294
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:40,696
Next Conan's Hint:

295
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,896
"The trace of a ring"

296
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,396
Next episode, Mom and Dad makes up!

297
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,996
-Really? -Yes, really!
