1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,140
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,040
Come on, dad, hurry up and get ready.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,340
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The movie's going to start.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,340
No way.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,540
Huh?

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,640
I don't want to go.

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,740
What?

8
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
Why not?

9
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,140
You were looking forward to seeing the new movie starring Yoko Okino.

10
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,240
I don't like what it's about.

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,340
What it's about?

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,040
I don't mind that Yoko Okino's playing

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,740
"Court Detective, Saki Kirie" -a beautiful and talented lawyer.

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,440
But her boyfriend's a former police officer and incompetent detective,

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,540
"You're under arrest!" -who accidentally becomes a suspected murderer

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,840
"Objection!" -and cleans his name using her detective skills.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,340
"You're the only one for me!" is what he cries

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,340
as the detective clings to his girlfriend

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,740
in this moving love and mystery.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,940
Who would go to see this movie?

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,340
It sounds interesting...

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,940
Maybe they based his character off Pops.

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,340
Besides, those movie tickets are for premium seats.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,440
"Invitation, Premium Seats" -Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,240
Eri probably got them for me.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,640
Well, yeah.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Unbelievable.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
She's definitely planning on showing up so she can tell me

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
to reflect on my mistakes like the detective in the movie.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,740
Does that mean there are things you think you need to reflect on?

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,340
You're starting to sound like Eri.

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
Really?

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,740
I don't like it!

34
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,740
If more impertinent women start appearing in this world,

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,040
we're done for.

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,140
Geez.

37
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,940
A friend request on my messaging app?

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,140
I wonder who it is?

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,140
Huh? Mom?

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,040
"Eri Kisaki" -But we're already friends.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,240
Maybe her secretary, Ms. Kuriyama, sent a message as a joke.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Is that so?

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,440
Then I'll add her to the group.

44
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,740
"Eri Kisaki" -"I've been captured by some bad people."

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,940
"Could you call the police?"

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,340
What?

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,940
Ran, let me see.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
What should we do?

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,740
Start by asking her if that's true.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,640
Okay.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,540
Is that true?

52
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,940
She responded.

53
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,440
She says she doesn't know where she is.

54
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,640
Darn!

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,240
Sounds like she was kidnapped from her office.

56
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,340
"Eri Kisaki: Just kidding! I'm joking!" -It was just a joke?

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,340
Geez, Mom.

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,640
But wait... Look.

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,540
"That message was from an impostor!" -The icons are different.

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,740
"They're using my phone to send messages!" -They're probably

61
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
not the same Eri you just added.

62
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,040
Hold on.

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,940
If the person using Eri's usual icon is an impostor...

64
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,840
The one without an icon is the real Mom...

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,240
"What are you talking about? I'm the real Eri!"

66
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,140
Darn it! They changed from Eri's usual cat icon to no icon!

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,740
"What are you talking about? I'm the real Eri!"

68
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,440
"No! I'm the real Eri!"

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
"Shut up, impostor."

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
"You're the impostor."

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
"No, you are!"

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,240
Mom are multiplying?

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,040
There's something wrong with these phone messages.

76
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,440
What happened to Attorney Kisaki?

77
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

78
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

79
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,440
His name is Detective Conan!

80
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:28,898
"Attorney Kisaki's SOS (Part 1)"

81
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:36,898
"Two hours earlier..."

82
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:37,898
"Law Eri Kisaki"

83
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:41,198
Attorney Kisaki, I'm back.

84
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:43,898
Here's your tomato juice and sandwich.

85
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,898
Thank you, Kuriyama.

86
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:47,998
I didn't have time to eat lunch.

87
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:49,698
I'm starving.

88
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:52,798
-Should you be eating that? -What?

89
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:54,798
Don't you have a movie date

90
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,798
with your ex-husband after this?

91
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:59,298
We're not divorced, we're separated.

92
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:00,398
And it's not a date.

93
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:01,998
I'm just going to see a movie

94
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,698
because my daughter wouldn't stop pestering me.

95
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,698
Besides, there's no telling what he'd say

96
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:12,198
if my stomach growled during the movie.

97
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:13,598
Really?

98
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,398
You don't mind your stomach growling in front of your clients,

99
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:20,598
but it bothers you if it's in front of your husband.

100
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,598
Oh, is that right?

101
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:30,798
Huh? We shouldn't have any more clients coming today.

102
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:32,598
Could you go check?

103
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:34,998
It could be a walk-in.

104
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,098
Sure.

105
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:49,498
If it's a client,

106
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,198
I'll probably have to eat lunch

107
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,898
in the car on the way to the theater.

108
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:59,798
Kuriyama, was it a client?

109
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:03,598
Kuriyama?

110
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,798
Kuriyama!

111
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:17,498
Gosh. Who are you?

112
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,698
This is emergency services.

113
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,398
Are you calling about an accident or a crime?

114
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:26,598
Eri Kisaki, we're with the Victims Association.

115
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:35,098
Geez!

116
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,698
Your mom's going out.

117
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,598
Stay there and behave like a good cat.

118
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,598
It hurts...

119
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,698
Gosh. How could you let a woman beat you?

120
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,398
Sorry...

121
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:53,598
Hello? Is something wrong?

122
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,798
-Hello? -Sorry, prank call.

123
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:57,898
Hey!

124
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:05,198
Hey, what should we do with the unconscious secretary?

125
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:08,098
Who cares? Just leave her.

126
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,498
She didn't see our faces.

127
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:14,398
You're taking the lawyer's phone with you?

128
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:15,498
Yeah.

129
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:18,098
We're going to show her husband, Kogoro Mouri,

130
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,798
an embarrassing video of his wife.

131
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:39,098
Okay.

132
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:42,498
Bring the case with the lawyer upstairs.

133
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,698
Okay.

134
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:47,098
I'll head up there first and help set up for the shoot.

135
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,298
Got it.

136
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,798
She's bleeding?

137
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:04,598
Darn. I don't believe this.

138
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,698
What?

139
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,598
The suitcase is bleeding?

140
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:15,798
But we're ready to start filming!

141
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:18,998
Maybe she bit her tongue off.

142
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:22,198
Open the case and check its contents.

143
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:23,298
Hey.

144
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:24,498
Huh?

145
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,498
Tell him to be careful when he opens it.

146
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:32,098
Huh? Yeah, I know.

147
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:40,098
Hey! What happened?

148
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,398
Answer me!

149
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,098
Hey! Hey!

150
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,898
My tomato juice plan worked.

151
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:58,698
It's no use. The shutter's too heavy.

152
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:05,598
Just as I thought, it's locked.

153
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,998
The windows are reinforced with wire.

154
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,898
I doubt I can break them.

155
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,898
Looks like I'll have to hide somewhere

156
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,998
in this abandoned building

157
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:21,098
until help arrives.

158
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:24,798
You idiot!

159
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,698
You mistook tomato juice for blood?

160
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:31,798
I told you to be careful when you opened it!

161
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,698
Sorry...

162
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,898
On top of that, she stole your phone.

163
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,998
If she escaped,

164
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:43,698
then we now have the opportunity to enjoy capturing her.

165
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:47,298
Now let's catch that escaped doe

166
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,398
and rip her skin off.

167
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:02,698
But where should I hide?

168
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:18,098
Come to think of it, the other day Ran said...

169
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:19,298
That's right.

170
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:24,298
The culprit hide a corpse inside a dresser in the zombie case.

171
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:25,798
What a surprise, right?

172
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:30,298
That trick involved using a cart

173
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:31,798
so the body wouldn't be found

174
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,398
even if the drawers were opened.

175
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:39,498
It should be good enough to hide in.

176
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:45,698
Hey, Attorney Kisaki.

177
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:47,398
Are you in here?

178
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:50,598
Hey, come on out.

179
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:53,998
Making this difficult isn't in your best interest.

180
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,098
Hey.

181
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,698
The drawers are sticking out a bit,

182
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,798
but I was able to hide.

183
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:04,598
Next I'll use this phone I stole from that man

184
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,898
to contact the police.

185
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:06,898
"Incoming call, unknown caller"

186
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,898
Hey, are you calling your phone?

187
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,498
Huh? Yeah.

188
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,698
But looks like she silenced my phone.

189
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:20,298
What if she calls the police?

190
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,198
Don't worry.

191
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:26,298
She doesn't know where we are.

192
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,098
And if she makes the slightest sound

193
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:30,698
while explaining her situation,

194
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:33,598
that's when we'll catch her.

195
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,198
All right. We'll split up and look for her.

196
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:38,698
Let's not make any sound either.

197
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:41,498
If I can't call anyone, I'll have to e-mail them.

198
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:45,298
But I don't remember anyone's address.

199
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,298
I know. I remember Ran's messaging app username.

200
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:55,098
Crap!

201
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:59,198
She's talking to her daughter through a messaging app!

202
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,798
Seriously?

203
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:01,798
Look!

204
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:05,498
Darn it! We have to stop her!

205
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:08,398
Pretend to be the lawyer

206
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:11,398
and join the chat to confuse them.

207
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:14,598
In the meantime, we'll find her.

208
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:17,398
Okay. Got it.

209
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:20,298
Use the same icon she's using.

210
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,298
Got it.

211
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,798
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Darn it!

212
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:26,298
They changed from Eri's usual cat icon to no icon!

213
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,098
"No! I'm the real Eri!" "Shut up, impostor."

214
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,198
"You're the impostor."

215
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,998
"No, you are!"

216
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:33,298
Mom are multiplying?

217
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:34,898
Darn it.

218
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,898
Now we don't know which messages are coming from the real Eri.

219
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,165
"No, you are!"

220
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:56,665
What's going on?

221
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:59,865
It's my fault for turning it into a group chat.

222
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,665
A group chat?

223
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:05,165
But why isn't mom calling me?

224
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,365
Because she can't make any noise.

225
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,565
Huh?

226
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:12,765
She probably escaped from her kidnappers,

227
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,865
and is contacting us from wherever she's hiding.

228
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,465
Then end the group chat immediately.

229
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,365
If you ask them separately for her birthday or something,

230
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:22,965
we'll know who's the real Eri.

231
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,065
Okay.

232
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:27,065
No, I think it's better to leave it like this.

233
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,065
What?

234
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:31,865
But the bad guys can see our conversation.

235
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:37,565
But she doesn't know where she was taken, right?

236
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:41,665
Attorney Kisaki said she doesn't know where she is.

237
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:44,865
So wouldn't it be better to keep chatting with the bad guys

238
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,665
so they reveal themselves?

239
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,065
Attorney Kisaki's smart.

240
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:55,065
I doubt she'd say anything that would reveal her hiding place.

241
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,465
Yeah, but...

242
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:02,665
We don't even know if it's the real Eri who's claiming she was kidnapped!

243
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:03,865
We do.

244
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:05,965
-Huh? -What?

245
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,465
You can tell, Conan?

246
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:11,265
Attorney Kisaki is a lawyer, right?

247
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:12,465
Yeah.

248
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:16,465
Shinichi told me lawyers use Western commas

249
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,565
"Japanese Comma" -instead of Japanese commas

250
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:19,665
"Western Comma" -in their documents

251
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,565
when writing horizontally.

252
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:27,365
That habit shows up in their normal writing, too.

253
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:28,365
You're right.

254
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:31,465
"I have to be up early tomorrow." -The messages I received from Mom before

255
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,465
all have Western commas.

256
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:39,565
Then check the "I've been kidnapped" message you received first.

257
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,565
Okay.

258
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,765
It uses Western commas.

259
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:47,865
Darn it. So she really was kidnapped.

260
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,865
Okay. I'm going to call the police

261
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,565
and have them check her office.

262
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:55,765
Ran, stay here and keep chatting.

263
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:56,765
Okay.

264
00:15:56,765 --> 00:16:00,165
Tell them you don't know who the real Eri is.

265
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:02,165
Make sure you use Western commas.

266
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:04,565
Got it.

267
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:09,865
Darn it!

268
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:12,365
We can't find her anywhere!

269
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:15,965
Where is she hiding?

270
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,565
Calm down.

271
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:21,665
She can't get out of the building.

272
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,965
She's a rat in a bag.

273
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,665
Yeah.

274
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:29,465
Hey, how are you doing? Are you confusing them?

275
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:32,665
Yeah, by pretending to be her.

276
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,865
Sure enough,

277
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:39,065
she can't tell who's who.

278
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:41,865
This is great.

279
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:44,765
"Ran Mouri: Which is it?" -Ran started using Western commas

280
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,665
in her messages.

281
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:50,065
Looks like she knows which messages are mine.

282
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:53,565
"Can you see anything?"

283
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,565
"Like the Toto Tower or the Metropolitan Government office building?"

284
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,865
"Mouri Detective Agency" -What are you asking her that for?

285
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,865
If she answers that,

286
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:08,365
the bad guys might figure out where she's hiding.

287
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:13,565
We don't even know if her hiding place has windows to the outside.

288
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:17,365
Yeah. That's why I doubt Attorney Kisaki will answer

289
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:19,365
but the bad guys might.

290
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,065
"I can see the government office building"

291
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,065
"but I can't see the Toto Tower." -She responded!

292
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,965
"I can see the government office building,"

293
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:28,065
"but I can't see the Toto Tower."

294
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:32,765
I see. So they're someplace where the Toto Tower is visible.

295
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,365
That's right.

296
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:38,165
It's nearly 5 pm.

297
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:42,265
Ran, tell her to call us immediately.

298
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,465
What?

299
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:46,265
But if she speaks, they'll know where she is...

300
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,865
She knows that!

301
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:55,865
"Can you call me now?"

302
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,165
Call?

303
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,765
They're calling.

304
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,665
"Incoming Call" -Darn it.

305
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:10,065
It's an IP number starting with 050.

306
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,865
Hello, Mom...

307
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:15,065
Attorney Kisaki, you don't have to say a word.

308
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,065
Just do as I say.

309
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:21,365
The bell of the church near the detective agency will ring soon.

310
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:23,665
If you can hear it from where you are,

311
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,165
could you tap your phone with your fingernail twice?

312
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:28,165
If you understand, tap your phone once.

313
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:29,365
Conan?

314
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:34,165
Okay. It should be ringing soon.

315
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,265
About three seconds.

316
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:49,865
What? What about three seconds?

317
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:53,365
Sound travels at about 340 meters per second,

318
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,265
and there's practically no wind today.

319
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:57,665
So Attorney Kisaki is probably in a place

320
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:01,565
about a kilometer from here from which the Toto Tower is visible.

321
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:04,865
Let's go!

322
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:06,065
Okay.

323
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,365
Conan...

324
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,865
He's just like Shinichi.

325
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:17,165
Come to think of it, this had happened a bunch of times.

326
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:21,065
Ran, what are you doing?

327
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,165
Let's go!

328
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,765
Coming.

329
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,565
Don't. I need to focus on rescuing Mom right now.

330
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,065
"Law Eri Kisaki"

331
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,565
Yes, that's right.

332
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,665
Yes.

333
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:42,465
Ms. Kuriyama just seems to have been knocked out with a stun gun.

334
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:45,165
She's fine otherwise.

335
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,565
I see... Got it.

336
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:50,165
By the way, Mouri, what are you doing?

337
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,365
You seem to be short of breath.

338
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:56,965
I'm heading to the place where Eri was taken!

339
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:00,065
What? You know where she is?

340
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,965
I'm panicked because I don't know!

341
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:06,865
It's okay, Mom! We're on our way!

342
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,965
Don't worry! Keep hiding!

343
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,665
What?

344
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:19,465
The lawyer and her daughter stopped chatting?

345
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:20,565
Is that true?

346
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:24,065
Yeah. My messages aren't showing as read.

347
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:28,265
Maybe she's using the phone she stole to call her daughter.

348
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:31,465
If the police figure out his number,

349
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,965
won't they be able to find us?

350
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,065
Don't worry.

351
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:38,265
I took the SIM cards out of our phones.

352
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,765
We can only make VoIP calls.

353
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:41,865
In other words,

354
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,765
they can't use cell towers to determine our location.

355
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:51,765
Besides, you removed the SIM card from her phone

356
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,665
and disabled the GPS, right?

357
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:54,765
Yeah.

358
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:55,865
More importantly,

359
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:59,365
apparently the daughter asked what she could see.

360
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:01,265
Did the lawyer answer her?

361
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:03,565
Uh, no.

362
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:06,265
Which means it's likely she's hiding in a closed space

363
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,765
where she can't see out any windows.

364
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,265
Focus your search on those kinds of places.

365
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:14,865
Got it.

366
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:19,665
So we need to search all the lockers and drawers in this building.

367
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:20,765
That's right.

368
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:23,165
I'll call you if we find her.

369
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,165
"Next Episode" -Attorney Kisaki, are you listening?

370
00:23:58,265 --> 00:23:59,865
You got a message from Attorney Kisaki.

371
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,265
What? No way.

372
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:02,665
Let's see.

373
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:04,165
"The crab's only half-boiled,"

374
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:06,865
"but as a result the two swordfish look delicious."

375
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:10,565
"Since it's light out tonight, why don't we eat outside?"

376
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:14,165
Well, even if her daughter gets here,

377
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:18,165
we'll just capture her and skin her along with her mother.

378
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:24,365
Next Conan, "Attorney Kisaki's SOS (Part 2)"

379
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,908
Next Conan's Hint:

380
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:29,508
"Crab and swordfish"

381
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:30,608
I'm done for!

382
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:31,908
Conan's acting suspicious, too.

383
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:33,208
This is all kinds of bad.
