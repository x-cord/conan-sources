1
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:03,757
Thief Kid who is after the big jewel, "Giraffe horns",

2
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:07,757
sends a letter of warning that he will be stealing it.

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,157
The giraffe horns cannot be taken out

4
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:11,457
unless the trick that Kichiemon Samizu had built

5
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:12,757
is undone by inserting the four keys

6
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:15,957
of the four pedestals into the keyholes at the same time

7
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:17,857
and turning them at the same time as well.

8
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:21,257
We, the members of the Detective Squad,

9
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,757
were appointed to guard the four pedestals.

10
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,757
But Conan was knocked out in the dark,

11
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:30,957
and the giraffe horns had suddenly vanished.

12
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:33,757
The four pedestals each represented the four legendary gods,

13
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:35,857
the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,

14
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:39,657
Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon.

15
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:43,457
Maybe the words of Kichiemon Samizu that are carved on the pillar

16
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:47,457
where the giraffe horns are stored have something to do with this.

17
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:53,657
I guess we'll have to solve this mystery on our own!

18
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,457
Brooding over passing seasons

19
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:18,457
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

20
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:20,157
Thief Kid who is confined

21
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:22,357
disguises himself as that guy?

22
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:24,057
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,857
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:27,957
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

25
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,770
"Thief Kid vs. Four Gods Detective Squad"

26
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,970
What? You want to confirm

27
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,670
the sounds and images at the time of the black-out?

28
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,870
I want to make sure and see that

29
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,270
there are no strange sounds or images.

30
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,370
That's true.

31
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,170
Because in order to turn the keys of the four pedestals

32
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,170
in the dark at the same time,

33
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,270
some kind of signal would be necessary.

34
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,870
Let's check with the VTR!

35
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,170
Black-out?

36
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,470
Don't panic! It was to be expected.

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,870
It's the sound of the shutter breaking,

38
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,070
and the wind and rain blowing inside the room.

39
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,570
I was so surprised I put on my hood.

40
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,870
-Me, too! -Same here.

41
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,570
Be quiet!

42
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,570
Okay.

43
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,370
-It's our voices. -Yeah.

44
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,170
Right.

45
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,370
This is the sound of the electricity

46
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,370
that is flowing through the pedestals being cut off, right?

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,870
-It can't be? -This is the sound of the pillar

48
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,270
in the center rising and the giraffe statue coming out.

49
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,370
So this is the light of the stun gun...

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,770
Conan!

51
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,570
The light turned on.

52
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,570
I turned it on

53
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,670
because I was worried at hearing Conan's scream.

54
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,070
It's after this.

55
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,170
The giraffe horns are gone!

56
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,170
It seems that the giraffe horns were already stolen at this point.

57
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,970
They're on!

58
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,470
So, there were no strange sounds or lights after all.

59
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,170
No. To be precise, nothing was unexpected

60
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,670
other than the flash of light from the stun gun

61
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,270
when this little glasses boy was attacked and his scream.

62
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,570
The sound of the pillar moving was heard before the boy screamed.

63
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,370
But it could be that the sound was a fake that Thief Kid played,

64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,670
and if at that point, Kid had finished

65
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,570
passing the keys around to his accomplices.

66
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,870
The moment we heard Conan scream

67
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,370
and moved away from the pedestal,

68
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,470
they could've turned the keys all at the same time.

69
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,370
That's true.

70
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,570
But are you sure all of you were guarding

71
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,970
the keyholes of the pedestal up until this time?

72
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,270
Yeah, we did!

73
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,570
With my hands spread out like this!

74
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,070
I was leaning against the pedestal,

75
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,070
covering the keyhole of the pedestal.

76
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,870
By the way, who was guarding which pedestal?

77
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,370
The one I guarded...

78
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,770
was that black pedestal!

79
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,270
I was in charge of the green pedestal!

80
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,270
I watched the white pedestal.

81
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,970
And I watched this red pedestal!

82
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,970
But, weren't you afraid?

83
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,370
Because although there was a black-out,

84
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,370
there was electricity going through the pedestals, you know.

85
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,770
Well, as for that...

86
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,170
Hey, gramps!

87
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,470
This floor is rotten here and there,

88
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,470
but isn't there an iron board inside like there is in the walls?

89
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,870
No. As to underneath the floor,

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,470
the ceiling and the pillars in the four corners,

91
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,370
I haven't touched them

92
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,170
because they were built intricately to begin with.

93
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,170
Well, he won't get away

94
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,670
because I've laid barbed wired all over underneath the floor!

95
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,270
Excuse me.

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,770
If you say that Kid's accomplices are among us,

97
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,570
I know someone who is suspicious.

98
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,270
This guy's who's in charge of audio!

99
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,770
What?

100
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,670
A young staff was supposed to come,

101
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,570
but he suddenly switched.

102
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,070
That's because I suddenly couldn't get in touch with him.

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,070
Talk for yourself too,

104
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,670
-then, you're just as suspicious as me! -Huh?

105
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,370
The person who was supposed to be in charge of the camera

106
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,870
was your subordinate in college,

107
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,970
but you forced your way to come here

108
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,970
saying that you are an old timer at this job.

109
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,570
What the heck are you talking about?

110
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,970
The one who called me saying that

111
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,970
he just got out of college and didn't have confidence

112
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,570
to handle a live broadcast is him, you know!

113
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,970
I heard so, too.

114
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,170
That advisor Suzuki went out of his way

115
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,470
to get the children uniformed parkas,

116
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,170
and that he also wanted a person

117
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,270
who was at home at the camera for this job,

118
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,970
so he switched cameramen.

119
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,570
I went out of my way

120
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,870
only because the TV station told me that

121
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,270
it would be more exciting that way.

122
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
Moreover, wasn't it you people

123
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,370
who told me the phone number to the company

124
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,970
who sells the parkas and introduced them to me? TV crew!

125
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,570
Huh? Me? I know nothing of it.

126
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,570
Did you call us over here

127
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,970
because somebody told you to do so, too?

128
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,170
No. It was written in post script in his letter of warning.

129
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,470
"Let's not resort to childish pranks this time,

130
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,970
and decide victory by adult means", you see!

131
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,070
So, I took it that he wasn't at home with children

132
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,770
and called the Detective Squad over here!

133
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,170
It's true

134
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,370
that if the phone call that the TV station received

135
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,770
was from Thief Kid,

136
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,470
he probably deliberately tried

137
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,770
to get rid of young people coming to this site.

138
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,170
But, if so,

139
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,270
why would he write something like that in postscript?

140
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,570
It's more than likely, judging from the personality of the advisor,

141
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,970
that if something like that were to be written,

142
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,970
he would most obviously call the Detective Squad over here.

143
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,670
But this case is full of mysteries.

144
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,270
It's strange that the treasure

145
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,370
that was taken is nowhere in sight either,

146
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,570
but the same goes for the four keys

147
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,070
that the advisor nailed to the wall.

148
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,470
If he nailed the keys on only slightly...

149
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,070
After using the keys,

150
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,570
if the keys were to be nailed back on to the wall,

151
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,570
the noise would be really loud.

152
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,070
But there was no such sound in the video that we just watched.

153
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,170
Maybe the fluorescent paint on the keys and the keyholes

154
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,470
are only tricks for diversion,

155
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,170
and the method explained on the pillar

156
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,370
that required using no keys was carried out after...

157
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,970
Gosh. How long to you intend to keep sleeping?

158
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,170
Lend me a hand, will you?

159
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,670
-White... -Huh?

160
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,970
Conan, are you up?

161
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,270
Not so loud.

162
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,170
Is the fact that you're up now a secret?

163
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,070
How come?

164
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,070
Idiot! This is the first time Kid ever passed me out.

165
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,070
How can I get up when I don't even know why he did that?

166
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,370
By the way, what's the beeping sound?

167
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,470
That's the sound of the electricity

168
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,770
that runs through the pedestals turning off!

169
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,570
It seems that the sound of the pedestals turn off

170
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,470
in the order of green, red, white and black.

171
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,970
That's why the Inspector asked us to guard the pedestals

172
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,470
according to the sound as they turn off.

173
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,170
And tell me the position of Kid's cards

174
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,270
that are stuck to the pedestals?

175
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,370
-The position? -Yeah.

176
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,770
Only on the red pedestal,

177
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,370
the card was stuck right above the keyhole.

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,970
I can see from here that on the green pedestal,

179
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,070
it's stuck a little more above that,

180
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,470
but I can't see the black and white one.

181
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,570
The white is the same as the red,

182
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,370
and the card's right above the keyhole!

183
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,670
The card is more above by the black than the green!

184
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,970
I see. That's how it works.

185
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,070
Okay. Will you surround my body

186
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,270
so that nobody can see me?

187
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,370
This position that I'm in is killing me.

188
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,070
What we don't want to see will be exposed, too.

189
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,170
No, that was just coincidence.

190
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,170
Dirty brat.

191
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,970
Come off it, if I were really dirty,

192
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,970
I'd keep my mouth shut and continue looking.

193
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,570
Conan!

194
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,670
I got it! The reason Kid knocked me out.

195
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,870
No joke?

196
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,970
And of course...

197
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,270
who Thief Kid is disguised as, among them!

198
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:26,617
Won't you notify one of the riot officers for me?

199
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,917
I'm sure that somewhere on the temple grounds,

200
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:33,317
the person that Thief Kid had disguised as, is being confined,

201
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,417
so notify the riot police officers

202
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,617
and have them look for him.

203
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:41,617
But, which riot officer do we notify?

204
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:46,317
True. If Kid's accomplices are among the them...

205
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:49,817
No, none of Kid's accomplices are here.

206
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,217
What?

207
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:57,017
Kid stole the giraffe horns with amber in them all alone.

208
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:01,517
By taking advantage of his four henchmen that knew nothing!

209
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,817
Four henchmen?

210
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:05,317
Don't tell me...

211
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:08,717
Hurry and open that door up

212
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,917
so that the officers can pursue Kid!

213
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,017
No, I can't open the door.

214
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,217
Why not?

215
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:21,417
I can't help feeling that he's still here in the room somewhere.

216
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,617
I can't shake the feeling

217
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,817
that he's waiting for the door to open any minute.

218
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:30,817
Exactly. Don't open the door.

219
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:36,817
Because he's probably surprised at what a tough time

220
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,717
he's having trying to escaping and cold sweating

221
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,917
somewhere in this room where there are no accomplices.

222
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,117
No accomplices?

223
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:47,617
Hey, hey. Have you forgotten?

224
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:49,117
You've got to insert the four keys

225
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,317
into the four keyholes at the same time

226
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,217
and turn the keys a the same time too, you know.

227
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:56,817
There're going to have to be at least 4 of them all together

228
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,517
including Kid to do it.

229
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:01,217
And to begin with the four keys

230
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,817
were fixed onto the wall like this

231
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:06,017
by the old man before anything happened.

232
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,417
The keys have nothing to do with what happened

233
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,917
because Kid didn't use them!

234
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:12,817
I told you, didn't I?

235
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:17,317
That there was florescent paint on both the keys and the keyholes.

236
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:21,317
But you don't know when the florescent paint was put there, do you?

237
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,517
Right!

238
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:26,817
Thief Kid could've put it on the keys and keyholes

239
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:29,617
even before the black-out!

240
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:31,717
That's true.

241
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:35,417
But can the giraffe statue be taken out without using the key?

242
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,417
It's written at the foot of the pillar, see?

243
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,417
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

244
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,817
without using the correct method,

245
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,717
must move with the flow."

246
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:48,817
This is the after care that Kichiemon Samizu

247
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:52,317
left behind in case the keys are lost.

248
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:56,317
It means anyone who wants to get a hold of the giraffe horns

249
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,217
without relying on the keys, should go with the flow.

250
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:01,117
What flow?

251
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,417
The four gods...

252
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:03,917
The pedestals in the four corners,

253
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:07,017
each represent the legendary deities belonging to the pedestals.

254
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:12,917
This green pedestal represents the Blue Dragon.

255
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,017
The white pedestal, the White Tiger!

256
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,017
The black one is the Black Tortoise!

257
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:20,817
And this red pedestal represents the Vermilion Bird!

258
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:25,917
But I wonder if there was a specific order to the four gods?

259
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,317
-Seasons! -Seasons?

260
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,317
The Blue Dragon is Spring.

261
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,317
Vermilion Bird, Summer.

262
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:34,217
The White Tiger, Autumn.

263
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,517
And the Black Tortoise is said to stand for Winter.

264
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:39,917
If "must move with the flow", means...

265
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,217
move along with the flow of the seasons.

266
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,917
It means to move your body

267
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,317
in order of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter!

268
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:49,017
Move your body?

269
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:52,217
In other words, bring your body close to the pedestal like this

270
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,017
and tilt your body.

271
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,017
Next, it's you, Ai!

272
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:59,017
Yes.

273
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:00,617
Okay, Ayumi.

274
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,117
Yep.

275
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,917
Lastly, it's you, Genta!

276
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,417
Aye!

277
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,317
The pillar...

278
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:14,717
Is moving...

279
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:16,617
And closing.

280
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,517
It... It's closed!

281
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,117
Now you know

282
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:26,817
that you can make the pillar go up and down

283
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,417
even without the keys.

284
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,317
But it only blacked-out for a mere minute!

285
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:35,517
Are you saying that Kid during this time

286
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,217
ran around the room without any light,

287
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:41,117
stuck cards to all the pedestals and tilted them?

288
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:45,317
Kid didn't. We're the ones who tilted them.

289
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:48,117
Because we were told to guard keyholes of

290
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:51,717
the green, red, white and black pedestals.

291
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,717
Isn't that right, Inspector Nakamori?

292
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:59,717
Rather... Mr. Magician under the Moonlight?

293
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,617
I see.

294
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:04,717
In order to guard the keyhole,

295
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:07,117
you'd have to bring your back close to the pedestal,

296
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:10,717
and guard the surroundings.

297
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:11,917
Hey, hey.

298
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,217
Then just how in the world did I stick the cards on?

299
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:17,017
He made us do that, too!

300
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,517
By cracking the window,

301
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,017
letting the rain and wind come in

302
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,817
and making us wear our hoods.

303
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,317
He made us stick the cards

304
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,317
with a sticky seal on them that were hidden inside the hood

305
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,317
and stuck to our backs when we leaned against the pedestals!

306
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:32,517
As proof of that, the position the cards are pasted on,

307
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:34,217
each correspond to the height of the one

308
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,417
who was guarding the pedestal, right?

309
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,317
Now that you mentioned it...

310
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:42,117
Kid most probably called Advisor Suzuki

311
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,817
using the voice of the reporter told him

312
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:48,617
that he would introduce a company that sold the parkas,

313
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,717
and planted tricks on them himself.

314
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:54,017
But it's amazing how the cards were stuck

315
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:56,017
onto the corresponding pedestals in the dark,

316
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,217
without making a mistake.

317
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,717
As far as what was seen on the VTR,

318
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,717
there was nothing like a signal.

319
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:04,917
Sound...

320
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,917
He told us!

321
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:12,717
To wait for the sound of the electricity flowing

322
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:14,117
through the pedestals turn off,

323
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,717
then, to guard the pedestals in that order!

324
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,717
I didn't set up such a sound though.

325
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,617
Of course there was!

326
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,917
It beeped.

327
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,717
An irritating sound.

328
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,317
-Did you hear such a sound? -No.

329
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,817
Not at all.

330
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,517
What?

331
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,317
Mosquito sound.

332
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,217
A high frequency sound

333
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:40,717
that gradually becomes inaudible to people over the age of 20

334
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,817
because the ears start to age.

335
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:46,417
He played that sound that only the children could hear,

336
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,017
and let them know what order to tilt the pedestals.

337
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,517
If nobody mentions anything regardless of the sound being heard,

338
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:54,217
everything would seem normal.

339
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:56,017
That's why you removed

340
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,617
all the young staff from the TV crew, right?

341
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:01,117
To avoid having anyone else hear that sound.

342
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:06,617
You told us nothing about that mosquito sound, though.

343
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:07,717
Sorry.

344
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:10,917
Then, where are the horns of the giraffe?

345
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,317
Oh, that's...

346
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:18,317
Inside the hood of my parka!

347
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,017
He pretended to take me,

348
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,717
who was knocked out by the stun gun to the hospital

349
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:26,317
and was planning to make it out of here, treasure and all!

350
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,017
Although, I realized right away when I got up

351
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:31,217
because of the weight of the treasure I felt.

352
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:34,417
By the way, he used the florescent paint

353
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,917
when the advisor handed over the keys

354
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:40,617
to show us the statue of the giraffe.

355
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:44,117
Back then, if he put florescent paint on the keys,

356
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:45,617
then the keyholes where the keys are inserted

357
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,717
will also have paint on them!

358
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:50,417
Then, where's the real Inspector?

359
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:54,417
Probably knocked out by a stun gun and around here some place.

360
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,117
Open the door!

361
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,817
The one that's inside is Kid disguised as me!

362
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:03,617
-Why not let him in? -Open the door!

363
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:09,217
But, if he came to get his accomplices out of here...

364
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:13,317
If he wanted to, he would've done that long ago!

365
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:15,717
-True! -Open the door!

366
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,317
The one that's inside is Kid disguised as me!

367
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:19,817
Okay, open the door!

368
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,117
How about it, Kid?

369
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:33,817
I've stamped all the adults except you.

370
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:37,417
Now you can't disguise yourself as someone else!

371
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:43,017
Because the one with no stamp on his face is you!

372
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,517
So, this is it, for you.

373
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:51,517
I wonder about that.

374
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:00,917
-Genta? -Turn on the lights!

375
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,017
Look for him!

376
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,617
The one that doesn't have a stamp on his face!

377
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:11,617
That's Kid!

378
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,517
But, Inspector.

379
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:16,417
Everybody's face is stamped.

380
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:19,017
Kid is nowhere in sight!

381
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,217
Impossible!

382
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:25,117
Where the heck did he disappear to?

383
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,717
He can't possibly disguise himself as a child.

384
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:30,217
Hey!

385
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,317
Help me!

386
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,017
Genta!

387
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,917
What happened? What's with that hole?

388
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,817
I don't know!

389
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:40,417
Somebody grabbed me in the dark

390
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:43,417
and I was shoved into this hole!

391
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:44,817
Come to think of it,

392
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:47,617
Kid disguised as Inspector Nakamori

393
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,917
was touching the floor.

394
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:53,217
He probably set up a simple bomb at that time

395
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:54,917
and opened a hole in the floor,

396
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:58,017
used Genta as the lid and escaped under the floor.

397
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:01,317
Okay! Kid is under the floor!

398
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:02,717
Open it.

399
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:04,717
Okay, I got it.

400
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,617
Genta, you stay right there and don't move, okay?

401
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:10,917
If somebody grabs your legs,

402
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,417
shout really loud and let us know, okay?

403
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,417
Okay.

404
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,917
Hey! Did you find him?

405
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,717
No, not yet.

406
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:19,517
Hold it.

407
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:23,517
Genta's 10 yen sized baldness, if I remember correctly...

408
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,117
Thief Kid!

409
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:36,317
I'll give this back to you.

410
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,817
It wasn't what I after to begin with!

411
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:40,817
When on earth did you...

412
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,017
What about Genta?

413
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:45,117
He's asleep under the floor.

414
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,217
Fast asleep.

415
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,717
I see.

416
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:50,917
So he just wanted to prove

417
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,217
that he could even disguise himself as a child.

418
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:54,717
Right!

419
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:56,617
I wanted to prove...

420
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,517
that nothing is impossible for Thief Kid!

421
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:05,417
-See you! -Hold it.

422
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,817
You've forgotten something.

423
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,217
That riot officer is Kid!

424
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:14,717
-Nab him! -What?

425
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:17,417
Kid?

426
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:20,217
If I make it into the woods in this disguise,

427
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,517
they wouldn't be able to tell me apart from the others.

428
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:47,417
"1 hour later" -Thief Kid detected!

429
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,917
6 kilometers west of the mountain temple.

430
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:55,917
It's Kid! There he is!

431
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,917
Why? How can they tell?

432
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,717
"I have obtained the Giraffe horns. -Thief Kid"

433
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:04,717
You're paying me back for passing me out, Kid!

434
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,317
"Next Episode"

435
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:09,717
I'm going to make French fries

436
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:10,917
from the potatoes I dig up from the field

437
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,317
and have them as snacks with my beer!

438
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:17,717
Inspector, this dead body!

439
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:21,317
Doesn't it look like it's pointing at his face with his index finger?

440
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:26,117
Maybe he tried to let people know who killed him using his own face!

441
00:24:26,117 --> 00:24:30,117
Why does he also have a wound on his forehead?

442
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:36,183
Next Conan, "Trap of the Roof Farm"

443
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,745
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:56,045
"Scarecrow"

445
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,845
Next time he may become you.

446
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:59,045
Idiot, I'll never let him to that.

447
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,745
Really?
