1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,767
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,467
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:05,967
Here comes the popular series.

4
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:07,567
A coincidental meeting at a social gathering

5
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:09,467
brings commotion and halt to the love affair of a police officer!

6
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,867
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,567
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,167
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,477
I see. You can't come.

10
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:05,677
Too bad.

11
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:09,877
I'm sorry. Some urgent work suddenly came in.

12
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,677
Don't be. It's work so it can't be helped.

13
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:14,177
That's right.

14
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:17,277
Tell him not to drink too much, will you?

15
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,777
Because I'm not going to defend him

16
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:22,177
even if he gets drunk and hassles a young girl that is within his reach.

17
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:23,777
Okay, I will.��

18
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,477
See you then, mom.

19
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,877
What's with that sigh of yours

20
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:37,077
just when we're about to dig in to delicious food?

21
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:38,377
Because...

22
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:42,077
Did you invite Aunty Eri to come?

23
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,877
Well, sort of.

24
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:46,977
I thought it was something like that.

25
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:50,777
When you suddenly said, "A fashionable cafe opened, so let's go."

26
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,777
I knew you had an ulterior motive.

27
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,277
Just as I thought.

28
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,677
No kidding.

29
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:56,977
I thought you were all for it,

30
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,977
saying that if it's delicious and inexpensive, let's go.

31
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:02,277
It was really tough getting reservations for this restaurant.

32
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:05,977
It's not all that bad a place,

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,077
but I'm sure that some young people use this place for socials and dates.

34
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,177
Huh? Mr. Mouri?

35
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:13,577
Hello!

36
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,877
Officer Chiba!

37
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:18,677
Officer Takagi is with you, too!

38
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,177
What's this?

39
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:23,077
Two men coming together to a restaurant like this to eat?

40
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,577
No!

41
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:26,977
We've come here for a social gathering!

42
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:28,077
Idiot! Shoots.

43
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:31,677
Social gathering? Does Officer Sato know of this?

44
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:36,277
Well, I'm just here to match the number of people who will be coming.

45
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,077
Rather, Officer Chiba dragged me over here.

46
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,177
Right? Isn't it?

47
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,377
Yeah.

48
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:43,477
Even thought that's true, when you say it that way

49
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:45,077
it sounds like you're lying.

50
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:48,077
So please don't tell Officer Sato about this.

51
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:58,877
"Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 1)"

52
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:00,977
Okay, here goes. Another toast!

53
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:05,577
Chiba, you're late!

54
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,277
The girls are all here from sometime ago and have all started already.

55
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:09,877
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:11,377
Let me introduce you

57
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,177
to my friend from my junior high school days,

58
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:16,177
the leader of this social gathering, Emoto.

59
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:17,577
How do you do?

60
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:19,277
And he is?

61
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:22,577
This is Detective Mouri. I ran into him coincidentally.

62
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,877
I know!

63
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:26,577
The Sleeping Kogoro, right?

64
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:27,677
Hello.

65
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:31,077
And he's your friend, or rather...

66
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:32,877
Yeah, my colleague.

67
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:35,277
Nice to meet you, I'm Officer Takagi.

68
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,977
Not really sharp, but I guess it's better than nothing.

69
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:43,577
He may have a foul mouth, but he's a good guy inside.

70
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,477
Is that so...

71
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:49,177
You're lucky today, Chiba.

72
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:53,377
There are two cute girls among the girls who are here today.

73
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:02,177
I'm happy for you.

74
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,177
Is one of them your older sister who may be coming today?

75
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,977
No.

76
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,977
I was told that one of them is an old friend of my big sister

77
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,677
and the other one is the best friend of her friend.

78
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:16,077
They both seem to be working for the police force.

79
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:18,877
-Police force? -Police force?

80
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,077
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,677
you used to say that you wanted to be a police officer before.

82
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:24,477
What are you doing now?

83
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:28,177
I'm a police detective, a detective!

84
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:31,077
Which means that dorky one there is also a cop?

85
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,477
Yeah, right.

86
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,777
Then, you guys may have met

87
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,977
those mini skirt police women somewhere.

88
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,477
Mini skirt?

89
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:43,377
Are you sure those two really worked for the police force?

90
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,877
Yeah, this isn't TV.

91
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:51,977
Who cares because we can't really dress fashionably during work hours!

92
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,777
-Yumi? -Yumi?

93
00:05:57,077 --> 00:06:01,077
Officer Takagi and Officer Chiba! What are you guys doing here?

94
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,977
Shoots. So you guys know each other after all.

95
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,377
Which means that...

96
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,377
The other woman is...

97
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,277
Yumi!

98
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:12,277
Hurry and come back.

99
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:15,077
I can't handle those guys alone.

100
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,877
Officer Sato,

101
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,677
what brings you here?

102
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,977
Officer Takagi? Officer Chiba, too?

103
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,477
And why are you guys here?

104
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:29,077
The atmosphere doesn't look too good, does it?

105
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,977
It's starting to get interesting.

106
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:32,477
Hey, Pops.

107
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,477
So with a moment's delay, I charged for the culprit like this...

108
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:40,377
And attacked his joints like this.

109
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:44,177
Please let me be the culprit next.

110
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:47,577
Just as expected of Officer Sato, she's caught the hearts of all the men.

111
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:53,477
More than that, the problem is that man.

112
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:56,477
You also solved the trick to the case the other day too, didn't you?

113
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:58,077
Tell us about it, tell us about it.

114
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:02,877
It was so easy that I forgot how I did it.

115
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:04,777
Don't be mean.

116
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,277
I guess I'll start heading home.

117
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,677
Hey, hey. What're you talking about?

118
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,877
This kind of time off doesn't come everyday, you know.

119
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:18,877
But I'm worried about Kouta who is staying home alone, too.

120
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:21,377
Is he your younger brother?

121
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:24,677
No. He's my cousin who's going to be five years old.

122
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,677
His parents are both on a business trip abroad,

123
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:31,377
so he's staying at our home for now.

124
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:33,077
He'll be fine.

125
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,577
You fixed his dinner before we came, didn't you?

126
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:37,977
Let's go all out today.

127
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,877
I've got work to do, too.

128
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,677
Why don't we forget about work just for today?

129
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:45,377
Your body occasionally needs time off, too.

130
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,577
Yes.

131
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:51,677
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:52,877
Officer Takagi!

133
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:54,377
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:55,377
No.

135
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:57,877
I really ought to be going home.

136
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,377
Because something strange happened just the other day.

137
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:01,877
Something strange?

138
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:03,877
Things to do with Kouta.

139
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,877
Like the Masked Yaiba battle card.

140
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,877
A battle card?

141
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:12,477
Yeah. One day, he brought his friends over and showed off his card,

142
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:15,077
saying it was a really rare card that I've never seen before.

143
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,977
He was saying that a kind man gave it to him.

144
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:20,277
He seems to have been a bearded man with long bangs,

145
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:23,277
who dropped his wallet right in front of Kouta.

146
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:26,577
When Kouta picked it up for him, Kouta was given that card in thanks.

147
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:31,777
Moreover, that man took Kouta to his residence and served him cake,

148
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,777
then asked him a lot of questions.

149
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:36,277
What was he asked?

150
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:37,477
According to Kouta,

151
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:39,377
that man is a fortune teller

152
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,877
and asked about the interior of the rooms of our house.

153
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,077
For example, about the position of the bed,

154
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,177
or what kinds of things there are at the entrance,

155
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,677
as well as the birthdays of my younger brother and I.

156
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,577
He also asked where the mails that are delivered are left.

157
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,177
Mails?

158
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:54,777
Kouta told him that I leave my mail in a box inside the closet

159
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:58,677
and that Masashi leaves his on his desk without putting them away.

160
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:03,377
He told Masashi that it is in a very good position so to leave it as is.

161
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:09,377
Was there anything important among the mails?

162
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:11,877
No, not as far as I know.

163
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:13,777
I have no idea either.

164
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:17,977
On top of that, it seems that the guy is a friend of mine, too.

165
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,177
Friend?

166
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:25,377
Maybe he's planning something to surprise me on my birthday.

167
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:27,577
How did you find out that he is your friend?

168
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:32,477
Kouta said there was a phone call while he was eating the cake.

169
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:36,077
The man happened to be in the bathroom, so the machine picked up.

170
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,977
Kouta says that the voice he heard was my voice,

171
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,877
so there's no doubt about it.

172
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,377
Then do you have any idea who he is?

173
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:44,777
Well...

174
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:48,577
I called here and there to gather members for this social gathering.

175
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:51,577
But I'm sure it's one of them.

176
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:56,077
The man who heard the message rushed Kouta back home.

177
00:09:56,077 --> 00:10:00,277
The guy probably panicked thinking that I would find out about him.

178
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,677
What was the message about?

179
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,477
Well, it was nothing really.

180
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:09,077
Just that my sister and I are having social gathering here today.

181
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:10,277
What was that?

182
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,077
Which means that the man knows that only the boy is at home tonight?

183
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,477
Please call him right away.

184
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,777
I tried several times but there's no answer,

185
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:21,977
so I figured I should head on home.

186
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:24,077
Yes, I think we should go check.

187
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,077
Yumi!

188
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,277
She's wasted.

189
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:28,277
Chiba!

190
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,477
Dad.

191
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:32,077
What is it?

192
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:39,277
Kouta!

193
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,177
Kouta!

194
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:44,077
You're taking it too seriously.

195
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,577
The door was locked, too.

196
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:51,077
That man was just asking about furniture placement and birthdays, right?

197
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:53,177
He could be a Feng Shui fortune teller or something.

198
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:54,977
That's what the problem is.

199
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:58,877
There are still many people who use their birthdays to unlock their safes,

200
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:00,577
so that they won't forget it.

201
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,577
Right.

202
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,477
If he knows the position of the furniture beforehand,

203
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:05,177
it would be easier to find the safe.

204
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,277
Or it could be that he used the mails and postcards

205
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:09,577
as a hint to figure out the numbers to unlock the safe.

206
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:13,477
And if the culprit cannot find what he is after,

207
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,877
the next action he would take is...

208
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:17,277
Officer!

209
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,377
Please come!

210
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:22,377
Look at this.

211
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,177
"I have the boy who is your cousin! Prepare 1,000,000 yen!"

212
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,677
"I will contact you later! Blab to the police and I'll kill him!"

213
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:27,577
-This is... -This is...

214
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:28,877
A kidnapping.

215
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:40,082
I have the boy. Don't call the police.

216
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:41,782
You're cops, aren't you?

217
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:43,482
That's true.

218
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:46,182
Well, I guess it's saving us needless energy.

219
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,382
At any rate, let's get support from headquarters.

220
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:49,682
No.

221
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:52,482
The culprit came in here and took Kouta away.

222
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:55,082
He could still be nearby checking things out.

223
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,482
If any more cops stampede in here, it would be too conspicuous.

224
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:01,282
Don't use cell phones either because the waves are easily picked up.

225
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:04,482
Contacting the police will only be after we confirm

226
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:05,982
that there are no wiretaps or the like.

227
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,482
That's the basics!

228
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,582
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,482
I'm sorry I got carried away.

230
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,182
No, don't be.

231
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,982
The culprit met Kouta once,

232
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:19,982
and is probably Mr. Emoto's friend, right?

233
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,782
Yeah.

234
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,582
Then, if you tell Pops about the details back then,

235
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:28,282
he might be able to figure out who the culprit is.

236
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:29,582
Well, I guess so.

237
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:35,082
If I remember correctly, it was Saturday a week ago, wasn't it?

238
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:36,082
Yes.

239
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:41,382
Kouta was out playing that day and came home a little after 8pm.

240
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:42,382
8pm?

241
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,682
That's pretty late, isn't it?

242
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:48,882
Yes. I was worried and thought of contacting the police.

243
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:53,782
But he came home looking fine and said,

244
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:58,182
"I'm sorry. I'll never do it again so don't tell my parents."

245
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:00,482
So I didn't scold him much.

246
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:03,682
But I had no idea that he was meeting someone so dangerous.

247
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,882
He probably dropped his wallet on purpose and made Kouta pick it up.

248
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:09,582
He then took Kouta to his house.

249
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,382
It was then that I happened to leave my message in his answer phone,

250
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:14,182
saying that we'll be holding social gathering

251
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:17,682
inviting my big sister and her friends.

252
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:18,782
I see.

253
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:23,482
It seems certain that the kidnapper is a friend of Masashi.

254
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:28,782
He probably asked Kouta about the position of the furniture in the house

255
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:31,982
and broke into the house tonight when both of you weren't home.

256
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:34,782
Do you have any safe in this house?

257
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:37,082
We have nothing fancy like a safe.

258
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,682
We also carry around our bank books and bank cards,

259
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:43,882
so we really have nothing here that is worth stealing. Right?

260
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,082
Yeah.

261
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:48,382
In other words, the culprit came into the house,

262
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,882
but didn't find anything worth stealing.

263
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:53,782
So he kidnapped Kouta instead.

264
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:57,182
And of the people that you invited to the social gathering,

265
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:59,182
do you know who couldn't make it tonight?

266
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:01,882
Yeah, there are three.

267
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,482
The first is Takuji Rokuda, a friend of mine since my childhood days.

268
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:08,682
The second is an under classman in my high school days called Hikiya.

269
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,882
And the third is a man who patronizes the gym that I work for, Mr. Satsuka.

270
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,382
All three of them are not bad people.

271
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,182
I can't imagine them kidnapping anyone.

272
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:20,082
Do you remember what time you called those three people?

273
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:22,582
I called Rokuda a little after noon.

274
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,482
I called Hikiya in the evening.

275
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:28,182
And Mr. Satsuka at around 7pm.

276
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,582
All three of them were called during the time that Kouta was out.

277
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:34,082
That is before noon to 8:00 at night.

278
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:38,782
There's one thing that bothers me though.

279
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:41,782
If the culprit made such complex preparations,

280
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:45,482
I'd figure he'd steal something deemed valuable.

281
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:51,382
True. If he wanted to kidnap Kouta, he could've done so two weeks ago.

282
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:55,182
That man was concerned about your mail, wasn't he?

283
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:58,682
Did you have any important mails or documents?

284
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:01,582
Nothing really that I know of.

285
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:03,082
Post card!

286
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,882
That's right! It's the New Year's special prize post card!

287
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:08,782
I'm sure the first prize for this year was a trip to Hawaii.

288
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,982
If he sells it at a ticket cash exchange shop,

289
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:11,682
it would add up to quite a sum.

290
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,782
He probably took down the names

291
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,882
and the post card numbers of the people he sent post cards out to and...

292
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:22,382
Here. These are the New Year's cards that came from those three.

293
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,682
They all won no prize though.

294
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:27,182
Are you sure?

295
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:31,382
Yes. Because I checked all the post cards we received.

296
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,482
Right.

297
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:35,682
Because unlike me, she's all into prizes and lotteries.

298
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:40,582
Talk for yourself. You go around collecting game cards just like a kid.

299
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:41,882
Collect cards?

300
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:46,082
Just like Kouta, I used to collect Masked Yaiba cards since I was a kid,

301
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:50,082
and still do even now.

302
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,282
I see.

303
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:54,282
That's why he knew that the card Kouta received was a rare card.

304
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:59,082
Well, if you suspect my friends,

305
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,382
1why don't we go over to their house?

306
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,482
All three of them should be home because they cancelled the gathering

307
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:05,882
saying they had something to do at home today.

308
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,682
Good idea. Since they're all suspects, let's go and check.

309
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,482
But what if he finds out that you're police officers?

310
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:16,082
We're going to act as if we stopped by on our way back from the gathering,

311
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:17,882
and we'll keep that we came here a secret.

312
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:21,882
And if the culprit makes any false moves, we'll nab him on the spot.

313
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:24,782
If the person's not home, he's the culprit.

314
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:27,682
I'm sure that Detective Mouri's face is already known,

315
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:31,082
so please wait here for contact from the culprit together with Aya and Ran.

316
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:32,482
Okay.

317
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:33,582
What about Conan?

318
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:37,482
Yes, I'll take him with me.

319
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,682
Because he notices a lot of things,

320
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,682
and I'm sure he'll throw the culprit off his guard.

321
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,382
Here it is!

322
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:53,882
Room 203.

323
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:57,182
Is this the first time you've come here?

324
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,682
Yeah, it's the first time to come all the way to his room.

325
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:03,782
Who is it?

326
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,982
It's me, Emoto.

327
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:07,982
I dropped by on my way back from the social gathering.

328
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,082
May I talk with you for a minute?

329
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,282
What is it at a time like this?

330
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,582
Sorry, sorry.

331
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:17,782
I talked about you at the social gathering and these two...

332
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:20,582
"Takuji Rokuda (26)" -You guys wanted to see me. Why?

333
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,482
Well, we also play in a band!

334
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:28,382
But recently his lyrics don't match my melody.

335
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,782
I want to hear your songs.

336
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:36,382
This is Conan. Nice to meet you!

337
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:38,682
Is he your son?

338
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,782
He's my younger brother!

339
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:53,782
You're pretty good.

340
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,882
Yeah.

341
00:17:56,482 --> 00:18:00,182
By the way, what are all these lottery tickets?

342
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:03,282
They're the year-end lottery tickets that I sent to you.

343
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,182
You'd better check them out good.

344
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:07,782
It's okay. I'll bet none of them are winning tickets anyway.

345
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:11,582
If you have money to buy so many lottery tickets,

346
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,882
why don't you get yourself a better room?

347
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:19,582
Maybe there's something good in that bulging mailbox of yours.

348
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:21,282
Yeah.

349
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:27,382
Amazing, amazing!

350
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:32,382
It looks a lot like Chiba's room.

351
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:36,782
I always wanted to be a model, so this is fantastic!

352
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,982
"Kadonari Hikiya (25)"

353
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:41,682
How flattering to be complimented by a beauty character like you.

354
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:42,782
So she's only a character to you.

355
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:45,282
I should've gone to the social gathering, too.

356
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:47,882
That's why I invited you quite persistently.

357
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:51,082
By the way, what was inside the limited edition event pack

358
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:55,082
of Masked Yaiba cards you asked me to buy and send you?

359
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:57,882
All of them were worth nothing.

360
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:58,882
How about you?

361
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:00,182
Me, too.

362
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:04,582
The super rare Potato Queen platinum card wasn't inside.

363
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:07,582
What's the limited edition event pack?

364
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:11,082
It was a one day thing where you could only buy two packs.

365
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:12,582
It's rumoured that among the seven cards inside,

366
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:17,082
a super rare card that is no longer sold may be included.

367
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:20,682
The price for those can go over almost 800,000 yen on internet auctions.

368
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:22,882
-800,000 yen? -800,000 yen?

369
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:25,682
Well, cards and figurines are good, too.

370
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:29,682
But, Hikiya, I'd advise you to look at real women occasionally.

371
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:38,082
Amazing, amazing!

372
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:40,782
I always admired old-time money so much.

373
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,682
I'm so overwhelmed.

374
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,182
But it's sort of obvious that you're acting it out.

375
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,282
"Yoshikane Satsuka (31)"

376
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:49,282
Which means you have some things like these, too?

377
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:52,082
No, nothing much.

378
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:54,182
Just stuff like a 10,000 yen Taishi bill

379
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:57,582
that have the end numbers 385 (Miwako) which is a homonym of my name.

380
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:02,382
Well, you should keep that safe without spending it.

381
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:04,782
Although it has no special value.

382
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,382
I thought so.

383
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:09,582
Something of value is here, take a look.

384
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,482
Fantastic!

385
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,282
The numbers are all matched.

386
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:19,082
You keep buying those rare bills despite going into debt,

387
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,282
that's why your wife runs out on you.

388
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:24,282
Sorry about last time.

389
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:27,382
I sent the 30,000 yen that I borrowed from you with the docs.

390
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:28,582
Did you get it?

391
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:30,282
Yeah, I did.

392
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:32,682
More importantly, you should start eating properly

393
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:35,282
and come to our gym again.

394
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,382
You looked like you have lost a lot of weight.

395
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:39,082
I suppose so.

396
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,582
So? There are no suspicious ones among them, are they?

397
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:49,082
Well, there was no man with long hair and a beard.

398
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,282
I'm sure the man was disguised to hide his face from Kouta.

399
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:56,482
You still suspect them? Give me a break.

400
00:20:56,482 --> 00:21:00,082
Kouta was nowhere in the room of the three, was he?

401
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:04,482
Maybe the voice on the answer phone was of somebody who sounded like me?

402
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,682
It's from my sister.

403
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:11,382
Don't tell me the culprit contacted her.

404
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:12,382
Lend me your phone!

405
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,782
Hello, what's up?

406
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:16,782
No, nothing yet.

407
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:19,982
But something that Kouta was saying bothers me.

408
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:21,682
What is it?

409
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,282
Something about the characteristics of the culprit?

410
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,582
No. It's just that when he ate cake at that person's house,

411
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,882
a baseball game seems to have been playing on TV.

412
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,482
He said...

413
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:34,882
It was a super boring game.

414
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:36,682
Super boring game?

415
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,382
Baseball games playing this season

416
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,582
are either high school baseball games

417
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,082
or the opening games for professional baseball!

418
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,782
Let's have investigators watch the houses of the three,

419
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:48,882
while we check on the baseball games that were played that day.

420
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,582
Maybe we'll be able to grab clues of the suspect.

421
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,982
Hey!

422
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:55,182
Do you have to go as far as to make investigators watch them?

423
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,782
It could be that somebody is really just playing a prank.

424
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,582
Kouta could even come home.

425
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:02,482
How can you be so carefree?

426
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:04,282
A child's been kidnapped!

427
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,682
Abducted!

428
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:07,582
It's nothing close to a prank!

429
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:10,982
Yeah, I guess so.

430
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,482
"Next Episode" -Kouta?

431
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:49,882
What happened to your socks?

432
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,682
They look wet.

433
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:54,082
Don't tell me that...

434
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,482
I can't figure it out,

435
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:59,682
the boring baseball game that Kouta was talking about.

436
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:02,282
Inspector, we've figured out who the kidnapper is!

437
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:04,882
If he refuses to come voluntarily, arrest him without a warrant.

438
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:08,782
Officer Takagi.

439
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:14,782
Next Conan, "Love Story at Headquarters 7 (Part 2)"

440
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,967
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,767
"A complete game"

442
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:22,267
Do you often go to social gathering, Officer Sato?

443
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,667
-What's with you, at a time like this? -Well...
