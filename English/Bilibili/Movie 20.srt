That's enough. Step away from the desk and put your hands up!

8
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,580
We've seen through your movements.

9
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,090
Furuya-san, are you all right?

10
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,400
Your eyes... no way.

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
Furuya-san, get out of the way!

12
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,730
Don't move!

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,530
Wait!

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,720
Wait!

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,910
Stop!

16
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,270
Hey, watch it!

17
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,130
What happened?

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,030
(The NOC are Stout, Aquavit, Rie...)

20
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,810
Who's that?

21
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,470
Akai!

22
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,240
Back off, Akai!

23
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
She is Public Security Bureau's business!

24
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,650
What?

25
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,810
As if I'll let you escape!

26
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,250
Shit!

27
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,980
(500 m Ahead, Under Construction)

28
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,340
If she gets away,

29
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,710
the whole world will be plunged into panic.

30
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,020
No way! Is she driving backwards?

31
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,700
Rye.

32
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,830
Interesting, I'll run over you!

33
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,550
Akai, damn you!

34
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,700
It's me.

35
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,300
I failed to capture them.

36
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,080
I'll leave the cleanup to you.

37
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Okay.

38
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,100
(Detective Conan
The Darkest Nightmare)

39
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,110
I am Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

40
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,180
When I had gone to an amusement park
with my childhood friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

41
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,240
I witnessed a man in the Black Organization
making a dubious dealing.

42
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,690
While I was concentrating on watching the dealing,

43
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,890
I didn't notice his partner coming up behind me.

44
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,760
That man made me drink a poison

45
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,560
and when I woke up,

46
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,760
my body had shrunk.

47
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,700
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

48
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,400
they'll come after my life again and can harm everyone around me.

49
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,280
I decided to hide my true identity
with the advice of Professor Agasa.

50
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,200
When Ran asked me my name,

51
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,320
I introduced myself as Conan Edogawa on a whim.

52
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,500
To gather information about them,

53
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,090
I crashed at Ran's house, whose father is a detective.

54
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,060
By the way,

55
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,820
there are other people besides the professor
who know my identity.

56
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,640
Ai Haibara. Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

57
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,730
She was originally a member of the Black Organization,

58
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,570
but when she ran away from the organization,

59
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,470
in an attempt to take her own life,

60
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,330
she took the same pills that I did,

61
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,710
and her body shrank.

62
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,890
The Black Organization that is shrouded in mystery.

63
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,370
What I do know about it is

64
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,580
that the code name of each member is
based on alcoholic beverages.

65
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,250
In order to expose these people,

66
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,360
there are undercover agents
who have become part of the organization themselves.

67
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,820
Central Intelligence Agency. CIA Intelligence Officer

68
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,810
Kir, a.k.a. Rena Mizunashi.

69
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,620
Bourbon, a.k.a. Toru Amuro, belonging to

70
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,970
the National Police Agency Security Planning Division,

71
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,240
commonly known as Zero.

72
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,650
And from another standpoint,

73
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,320
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI,
secretly chasing the Black Organization,

74
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,290
James Black.

75
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,820
Andre Camel, Jodie Starling,

76
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,470
and Shuichi Akai.

77
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,870
He is the sharpest guy in the FBI,

78
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,220
and a sharp shooter.

79
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,490
But apparently, he and Amuro have

80
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,480
an uncanny connection.

81
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,550
Even though I've become smaller, my mind remains the same.

82
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,910
I'm the unbeaten great detective...

83
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,370
Only one truth will prevail!

84
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,450
Professor, I don't have any more sweets.

85
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,480
What? Have you already eaten them all?

86
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,200
Even our share?

87
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,100
Sorry, sorry.

88
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,340
- Didn't you say it was for everyone?
- What are you looking at so intently?

89
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,680
We'll be there soon. Don't be so upset.

90
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,740
Because the cause of the massive power outage last night
still hasn't been announced,

91
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,650
(Towards "GW" The Latest Pickup Spot Touto Aquarium)
I just thought it was weird.

92
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,920
It's a special program on the aquarium we're going to.

93
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,130
Let me see, Conan-kun.

94
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,000
Show me, as well...

95
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,440
- The Touto Aquarium.
- This belt is annoying.

96
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,830
Hey, hey, don't take it off while we're riding.

97
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,420
- was closed, but will be opening from today.
- It's boring.

98
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,880
- I will now give you information on that.
- We're almost there, so please be patient, Genta-kun.

99
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,350
It's started.

100
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,070
Now, let's take a look at some of the highlights

101
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,650
("GW" Recommends Touto Aquarium)
of the major changes done before the reopening,

102
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,830
from the video shown here.

103
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,750
(Reopening Today!!   The fascinating Touto Aquarium)

104
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,130
Because of the renovation this time,

105
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,580
three things have evolved.

106
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,840
The first thing I want to draw your attention to is

107
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,630
that all amusement facilities and various stores
are now located indoors.

108
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,660
That way, you don't have to worry about the weather.

109
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,650
You can now enjoy

110
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,350
all the facilities to the fullest

111
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,240
from opening to closing!

112
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,380
The next point to note is

113
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,760
the aquarium's main attraction,

114
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,260
a spectacular show by the dolphins.

115
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,330
It has been a popular attraction for a long time,

116
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,380
and now the content of the show has been renewed.

117
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,310
The dolphins will further refine their performance

118
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,000
- and give us a time of wonder and excitement.
- I got kissed by a dolphin! Bye bye!

119
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,630
- Wow, that's nice. Let me touch it too.
- And finally, I would like to introduce you to

120
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,400
the biggest selling point of the renewal.

121
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,550
The world's first giant double-wheel Ferris wheel.

122
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,810
The North wheel and the South wheel are located

123
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,660
at the north and south side, respectively.

124
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,300
You can enjoy different views
depending on which side you boarded on.

125
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,590
Also using the fountains built around the Ferris wheel,

126
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,160
a special Water and Light Show will be held,

127
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,400
and you can enjoy a spectacular view from this collaboration

128
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,790
from 100 meters above the ground.

129
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Wow! Looks so exciting!

130
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,070
Let's ride this Ferris wheel.

131
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,170
That's a good idea!

132
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,610
I thought we were going to the aquarium.

133
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,210
Why don't we go to both? Right?

134
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes.

135
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,020
Oh, great! Let's go to both.

136
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,090
Professor,

137
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,910
please pay for our tickets.

138
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,340
Wow, I can see the big one!

139
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,260
You're right.

140
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,350
Amazing!

141
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,260
We'll be there in less than five minutes.

142
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,890
Here we are.

143
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,220
Let's go!

144
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,310
Yippee!

145
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,110
Wait, Genta-kun!

146
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,750
Professor, hurry up! Hurry up!

147
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,950
Haibara-san and Conan-kun, please come quickly!

148
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,510
So, which have you decided on going to,
the aquarium or the Ferris wheel?

149
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,680
What are you talking about, Professor?

150
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,700
To both of course!

151
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,730
Then, here's a contest.

152
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,250
If you can answer the question I'm about to give you,

153
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,700
I will take you to both places.

154
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,790
Then let's begin.

155
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,100
Which of the following four colors will change

156
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,180
when the colors are applied without mixing them?

157
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,610
1 Red   2 Blue   3 Brown   4 Black

158
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,950
Without mixing...

159
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,150
Is it a color that changes when it is applied?

160
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,790
Ughhhh! I don't understand it at all!

161
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,190
Professor, you are so childish.

162
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,840
If you rephrase each color's name,

163
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,590
it will be a little easier to understand.

164
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,030
- Hey, hey, Conan-kun, you cannot join them.
- Rephrase?

165
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,850
For example, red is bright red, blue is bright blue.

166
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,370
Ai-kun, you shouldn't tell them?

167
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,520
I got it!

168
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Brown changes to gree tea, right?

169
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,980
Oh, it changed!

170
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,840
Yes.

171
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,330
What are you talking about?

172
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,710
Red is bright red, blue is bright blue.

173
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,500
Brown is bright brown, black is jet black.

174
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,410
Notice the brown color, Genta-kun.

175
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,870
(3  Brown  Bright brown  Matcha  Green tea)
Only the brown color becomes green tea.

176
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,140
Oh, that's right! It becomes green tea!

177
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,730
Wait a minute. It's not fair to give them hints.

178
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,930
All right, let's go to buy tickets.

179
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,290
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

180
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,350
Hey!

181
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,500
We'll start with the Ferris wheel!

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,300
We can't go to both! Just one!

183
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
Everyone, come here.

184
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,790
The Ferris wheel is so crowded.

185
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,330
Maybe it will be an hour's wait.

186
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,760
The Ferris wheel is so huge.

187
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,700
I wonder if we can see our house.

188
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,850
- What's wrong?
- I want to eat ice cream.

189
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,480
- What?
- I'll buy you one later.

190
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,000
Hey, hey, are you okay, onee-san?

191
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,710
You have dirt on your face.

192
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,280
Your left and right eye is of a different color.

193
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,590
I don't think she can understand Japanese.

194
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,560
I understand. I can understand.

195
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,360
What happened? Why are you here all alone?

196
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,550
You don't seem to have any friends.

197
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,400
And you're injured. Your knee and your hand.

198
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,860
It also looks like your phone is broken.

199
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,080
Can I see this for a bit?

200
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280
Yeah.

201
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,570
How long have you been here?

202
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,670
Um...

203
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,560
Then, where did you come from?

204
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,700
I don't know.

205
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,360
What's your name?

206
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,160
My name?

207
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,220
I'm sorry. I don't know.

208
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,250
Can I have a look at your head?

209
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,780
S-Sure.

210
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,300
It's not a big injury, but it's recent.

211
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,660
Maybe she was in a car, had an accident,

212
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,850
and got a head injury.

213
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,630
If so, it's traumatic retrograde amnesia.

214
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,600
Wait, how do you know she was in a car?

215
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,590
This smart phone has been completely smashed,
so it must have been a big impact.

216
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,250
And look, this is a piece of a car's windshield.

217
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,310
So are you saying that she hit her head while driving?

218
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,260
And that car must have been old and in poor condition.

219
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,350
Nowadays, cars have a film over the glass
to keep it from shattering.

220
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,790
And there is also a faint smell of gasoline from her body.

221
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,610
Yes, it is.

222
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,650
Onee-san, do you have anything else with you?

223
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,150
What's this?

224
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,330
Let me have a look.

225
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,560
Okay.

226
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,990
What is that?

227
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,360
What's this? This looks like a wordbook.

228
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,300
The cards have transparent colors on them.

229
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,040
I wonder what these cards are for?

230
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,060
Hey!

231
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,610
Conan, Haibara!

232
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,450
We've bought tickets for both of you too!

233
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,070
- Shoot, the nasty guys are back.
- Hurry, let's go for a ride!

234
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,740
Huh, who's that woman?

235
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,890
Oh, your eyes,

236
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,650
the left and right ones have a different color.
They're beautiful!

237
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,690
Does she have a fake eye?

238
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,210
No, Genta-kun.

239
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,370
I think she has "odd eyes".

240
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,780
Odd eyes?

241
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,040
That's a funny name for her.

242
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,360
No, not her name...

243
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,320
I got it!

244
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,390
You mean like the fur seal's eyes, right?

245
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,820
Fur seal?

246
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,610
It's about eyes, isn't it Conan-kun?

247
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,260
A-Ah!

248
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,540
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,860
She laughed at us.

250
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,530
By the way, what are you guys doing here?

251
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
Good timing, Professor.

252
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,130
It looks like she was in an accident and

253
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,100
apparently has amnesia.

254
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,190
Really? Shin...

255
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,230
Oops no, I mean Conan-kun.

256
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,870
Yeah. It could be related to last night's accident.

257
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,230
We must inform the police right away.

258
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,710
Stop!

259
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,490
Is there a reason you can't go to the police?

260
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,490
I don't know.

261
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,510
But you need protection.

262
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,150
- Hey, hey. It's rude to take a picture suddenly.
- Wait, Conan-kun...

263
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,910
Wait. We won't call the police.

264
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,260
I needed a picture so that we can search for your acquaintances.

265
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,170
My acquaintances?

266
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,330
Let me help you get your memory back.

267
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,690
Seriously, Conan?

268
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,410
We'll help you too!

269
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,260
Because...

270
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,990
We are the Detective Boys!

271
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,200
We'll find your friends and get your memory back.

272
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,600
You can count on us!

273
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,180
Thank you.

274
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,240
Well, first we need to find someone who knows you.

275
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,060
Yes, sir.

276
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,980
What are you all going to do about the Ferris wheel?

277
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,900
What are you talking about, Professor?

278
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,260
We don't have time for that.

279
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,950
- Oh no! And I even specially bought the tickets.
- First, let's ask that dolphin.

280
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,240
Professor, you're in the way.

281
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,390
Let's go.

282
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,620
Let's start the search!

283
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,090
Come on, hurry, hurry!

284
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,780
Hey, you guys!

285
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,140
You cannot do that just for fun.

286
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,320
Do you really intend to not report her to the police?

287
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,750
Of course not.

288
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,370
(Detective Mouri's Agency)
Last night, on the Metropolitan Expressway Route 11

289
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,430
there was an accident in which
a car exploded and burst into flames.

290
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,730
Dad.

291
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,000
It might not seem miraculous but the driver of the car

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,390
has apparently left the scene

293
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,900
and is being sought by the police.

294
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,130
(Massive Power Outage on Metropolitan Expressway Wangan Route.
What caused it?)

295
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,150
Dad!

296
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,030
How long have you been sleeping off work?

297
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,510
Shut up!

298
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,440
Detectives need a brain break, you know?

299
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,440
In other words, you drank to much and have a headache, isn't it?

300
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,710
Why? I mean... no one...

301
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,970
said... no one said that!

302
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,090
This is from Conan-kun.

303
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,230
Because he protected someone with amnesia,

304
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,880
he wants you to call the police.

305
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,320
Anyway, I've informed Takagi Officer.

306
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,230
You should help them too.

307
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,290
Beautiful!

308
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,490
Are you listening?

309
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,560
Where is this lady right now?

310
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,650
She is in the Touto Aquarium.

311
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,760
Understood!

312
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,410
Wait, Dad.

313
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,360
This request was accepted by this great detective.

314
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,090
It's not a request... Geez...

315
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,170
Inspector,

316
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,620
this is the picture that Ran-san sent us just now.

317
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,040
According to the report,

318
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,530
she might have been in a car accident.

319
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,890
A car accident, huh.

320
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,080
There was a massive one last night.

321
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,780
If I remember correctly, the driver is missing.

322
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,630
It was such a terrible accident,

323
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,110
but the media and even

324
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,890
we haven't received accurate information.

325
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,210
Does this mean...

326
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,490
I think we need to look into it.

327
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,770
Inspector Megure.

328
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,180
How was it?

329
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,650
The 3rd Investigation Division

330
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,760
also hasn't received any specific information.

331
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,030
I see.

332
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,860
What was it?

333
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,730
I heard a rumor that last night

334
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,600
someone broke into the National Police Agency.

335
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,760
In the National Police Agency?

336
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,850
But that information has not come down
to the Metropolitan Police Department.

337
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,830
What do you mean?

338
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,850
Maybe there is some big force at work here.

339
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,030
Found her.

340
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,530
I found her, Gin.

341
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,130
Where?

342
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,180
At the Touto Aquarium.

343
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,440
Aquarium?

344
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,540
Yeah.

345
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,530
Don't worry. I'll bring her home soon.

346
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,350
Thank you very much for coming today.

347
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,180
- Is the fountain show starting yet?
- Soon,

348
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,620
the Special Dolphin Show will be starting.

349
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I wonder if she has ever really been here.

350
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,130
It's strange that even with
those distinctive hair and eye colors,

351
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,340
none of people can recognize her.

352
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,650
So where are you planning on going next?

353
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,440
We've walked around most of the ground area.

354
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,330
(Touto Aquarium Map)
Good luck, Onee-chan!

355
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,150
It's the last one. Go carefully.

356
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,320
What are they doing?

357
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,420
Unbelievable!

358
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,110
Congratulations! You have the highest score of the day!

359
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,830
Here, Onee-chan too.

360
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,830
Please put out your hands.

361
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,990
Give me a high five, too!

362
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,990
Me too!

363
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,500
Woo-hoo!

364
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,340
Me next!

365
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,980
You smiled again.

366
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,870
I think you should smile more.

367
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,630
Yes.

368
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,660
Definitely.

369
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,720
Do you think so?

370
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,750
Absolutely!

371
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,020
Now, pick three key-chains as your prizes.

372
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,050
Hooray!

373
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,080
Is it okay to pick three?

374
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,490
- I'll get this one.
- This one, this one!

375
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,890
I'll take that one.

376
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,430
Okay, you want this one, right?

377
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,050
Huh, how about yours, Onee-chan?

378
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,760
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

379
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,190
But...

380
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,310
You won them for us.

381
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,690
Hey, you guys.

382
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,150
Conan-kun, Ai-chan.

383
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,920
You are totally having fun.

384
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,940
Weren't you supposed to bring back her memories?

385
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,050
But...

386
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,570
We thought we'd start after we played this game.

387
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,100
And then she got this for us.

388
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,320
Hey, hey, start from now?

389
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,320
- Well, we'd better look around this area too.
- Let's go to the next one.

390
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,920
Hey, I'm here! Here!

391
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,360
This is your Hiroshi, here!

392
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,640
- Professor!
- I'm here!

393
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,020
What are you doing up there?

394
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,660
The Ferris wheel is less crowded.

395
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,240
If you want to ride on it, now's your chance!

396
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,800
Really?

397
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Then, let's start by riding on the Ferris wheel.

398
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,320
That's a good idea.

399
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,490
The view might remind her of something.

400
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,490
Okay!

401
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,630
Onee-chan, let's go for the Ferris wheel ride.

402
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,040
Let's go! Let's go!

403
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,350
Geez.

404
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,460
Well, let's keep the Ferris wheel-loving Professor company.

405
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,670
So the one who wanted to ride
in the Ferris wheel the most is Professor, huh.

406
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,810
That's correct.

407
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,270
Excuse me.

408
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,340
Do you recognize the woman who was playing darts earlier?

409
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,740
Do you mean the silver-haired lady from earlier?

410
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,670
Yeah, do you know her?

411
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,520
I don't recognize her. I wouldn't forget a customer

412
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,480
as skilled as her.

413
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,230
All in a double bullseye.

414
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,270
That's not something she can do on a fluke.

415
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,440
Thank you, Onii-san.

416
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,860
Oh, right!

417
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,510
can you please pass this to your friend from earlier?

418
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,100
Huh? What is this?

419
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,030
We had a few extra prototypes left over before coloring.

420
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
We didn't have enough for Onee-san earlier,

421
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,060
so I hope this can help.

422
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,020
It's not colored yet.

423
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,100
So she can have fun painting it in any color.

424
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,310
Yeah, I think she'd love it.

425
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,090
Thank you, Onii-san.

426
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Your welcome. Have fun!

427
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,910
Let's go, Haibara.

428
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,690
So, where do we go next?

429
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,160
Once we've finished gathering information
from the rest of the under-construction areas,

430
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,790
let's meet up with the Professor.

431
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,270
There's also the thing regarding the darts, but

432
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,620
instead of searching for her traces,

433
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,610
I think observing her behavior will be a good plan.

434
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,610
This is so exciting!

435
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,890
What will we see when we reach the top?

436
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,490
I'm sure we can see Bell Tree Tower.

437
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,900
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, yes!

438
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,040
Let's go home.

439
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,630
Hey, Onee-chan, don't space out or we'll leave you behind.

440
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,960
Sorry.

441
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,260
I felt like someone was talking to me.

442
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,080
Did you see someone you know?

443
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,850
No. I guess I was wrong.

444
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,880
So then, everybody has gathered, right?

445
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,260
Yeah!

446
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,580
Then, this way please.

447
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,320
Change of plans.

448
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,290
There seems to be some trouble.

449
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,610
Hurry up. We can't just leave her to do as she pleases.

450
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,150
I know.

451
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,380
Mom, wait.

452
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,870
In the end, there was no outcome
from the under-construction area.

453
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,680
It's about time you contact Professor, Haibara.

454
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,820
What?

455
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,940
What's the matter with you?
You've been absent-minded for a while.

456
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,380
Is that so?

457
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,780
Conan, Haibara!

458
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,560
This way!

459
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,480
Up here! Up!

460
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,210
We're here!

461
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,110
Can you see us?

462
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,350
I'm telling you we are here!

463
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,540
- Genta, watch out!
- Watch out!

464
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,210
Why?

465
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,370
- Genta!
- No!

466
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,020
Genta!

467
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,080
Genta-kun!

468
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,500
- I can't do it here.
- I'm falling. Onee-san, help!

469
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,470
Oh, no, no!

470
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,630
- Genta-kun!
- Genta!

471
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,780
Are you okay, Genta?

472
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,590
Genta-kun, are you okay? Pull yourself together!

473
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,850
Huh? Why are you here?

474
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,330
I'm glad you're safe.

475
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,560
Oh, I see. I fell down from the top.

476
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,490
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

477
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,390
Because Onee-san helped me,

478
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,300
I'm totally fine.

479
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,290
Good.

480
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,970
Please come to the medical office, just in case.

481
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,740
What is going on here?

482
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,110
Yes. With this, everything will be fine.

483
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,170
Oh, thank you very much.

484
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,530
Umph! Ooh, ouch, urgh!

485
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,590
Why is the Professor in pain the most?

486
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,060
Pathetic.

487
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,590
He's just like a kid.

488
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,470
You guys will understand when you are older.

489
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,330
Professor seems to be okay.

490
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,000
Let's go for a ride on the Ferris wheel.

491
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,330
Thanks, Onee-san.

492
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,120
Then, let's go.

493
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,270
Let's go.

494
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,850
Yeah, but... won't I be an annoyance?

495
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,350
What are you talking about after all this time?

496
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,070
You are my life saver.

497
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,120
Yeah.

498
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,640
Then, let's go for a ride.

499
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,700
Wait!

500
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,950
Edogawa-kun, can I talk to you for a second?

501
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,440
Then, we will be going ahead.

502
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,820
No! Wait, Professor.

503
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,860
What's going on?

504
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,270
So boring.

505
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,210
What? What?

506
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,170
Listen.

507
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,050
While Conan-kun and Haibara-san
were engrossed in their conversation...

508
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,990
Are you sure

509
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,090
that she is one of them?

510
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,210
I can't say I'm very sure, but...

511
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,880
But, you also felt something, didn't you?

512
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,900
Her right eye. Thinking back now,

513
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,200
it seems as if it's fake.

514
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,170
Fake...? Can't be!

515
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:01,520
Yes. The number two of the Black Organization
that you were talking about.

516
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,090
Rum.

517
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,400
Onee-san. Onee-san.

518
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,270
What is it?

519
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,100
If she really is Rum,

520
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,400
I doubt whether she really has amnesia.

521
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,540
If I recall, Rum's gender and age are unknown.

522
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,090
Yeah. When I was in the organization,

523
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,020
I heard rumors that he's a big, strong man,

524
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,000
a man like a woman, an old man. Everyone said different things.

525
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,570
And then, in some accident, she injured her eye.

526
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,900
So one of the eyes is an artificial eye.

527
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,630
If that woman isn't odd-eyed, if her eye is an artificial eye...

528
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,290
Indeed.

529
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,490
So amnesia is an act, huh.

530
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,730
But why would she need to act like that

531
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,530
to get close to us?

532
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,470
That...

533
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,470
Certainly, with her physical capabilities,

534
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,100
we should be wary of her as a member of the organization.

535
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,460
But if she really has got amnesia...

536
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,100
it would be the other way round.

537
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,360
We shouldn't! We definitely shouldn't
let her get back her memories!

538
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,140
I hope you aren't thinking of

539
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,830
gathering information about the organization

540
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,350
after she regains her memories!

541
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,260
If you do that, it won't just be you and me,

542
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,380
they could kill those kids too!

543
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,980
Where are they?

544
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,210
What is the professor doing?

545
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,830
Lovely pigeons.

546
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,970
Professor!

547
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,810
Coo coo pigeons!

548
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,020
This is no time to do that, Professor!

549
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,810
Where did the kids go?

550
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,660
Uh... Huh?

551
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,740
(Conan-kun Calling, Reject, Answer, Switch Answering Machine)

552
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,240
Ugh... it's from Conan-kun.

553
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,130
You shouldn't answer it.

554
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,120
He'll just get angry.

555
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,450
I guess so.

556
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,600
Oh, look, the pigeons have just flown in.

557
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,130
You're right!

558
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,540
Can you see that, Onee-san?

559
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,010
There are so many of them!

560
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,050
The person cannot be reached right now.

561
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,630
Damn them!

562
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,970
They're probably on the Ferris wheel.

563
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,580
They really wanted to ride on it too.

564
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,730
Yeah. Let's go.

565
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,060
Hold on a second!

566
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,510
Onee-san, you must have played some kind of sport.

567
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,660
Huh?

568
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,710
If you didn't,

569
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,570
you wouldn't have been able to rescue Genta-kun like that.

570
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,570
I think so too.

571
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,740
Because you have a great style.

572
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,910
Great style... Do you think so?

573
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,690
Yeah. You look like a supermodel.

574
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,790
The fountain's getting bigger!

575
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,860
It's rising up!

576
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,520
So amazing!

577
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,890
See that, Onee-san?

578
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,630
Yeah, it's beautiful.

579
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,010
Everyone, look below.

580
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,420
There's a rainbow. Look.

581
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,160
Onee-san, come forward.

582
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,830
Yes.

583
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,080
Are you okay?

584
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,310
What's wrong?

585
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,850
I'm... I'm fine. Just a little dizzy.

586
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,510
I bet you're not very good with heights.

587
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,890
We're almost at the top.

588
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah!

589
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,970
It's the top of the top now.

590
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,980
What a view! What a view!

591
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,270
You okay, Onee-san?

592
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,260
Hey, pull yourself together!

593
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,770
- Is your head hurting?
- What should we do?

594
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,930
Wait a minute. I will ask for help immediately.

595
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,670
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, what should we do?

596
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,120
She's saying something strange.

597
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,930
She might have remembered something.

598
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,840
The NOCs are...

599
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,890
Ayumi-chan, please call Conan-kun with this.

600
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,670
Okay.

601
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,640
Genta-kun, what did she say?

602
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,470
Something about slamming the door.

603
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,430
Door?

604
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,240
Kir... Bourbon...

605
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,470
She's saying something again.

606
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,690
Please be quiet, Genta-kun.

607
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,230
Stout... Aquavit... Riesling...

608
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,010
(Stout, Aquavit)

609
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,540
Please, hurry...

610
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,460
It connected!

611
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,240
What's the matter?

612
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,140
Phone call. It's probably... See?

613
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,870
Mitsuhiko, you guys!

614
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,600
Conan-kun, help us!

615
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,260
Ayumi? What's wrong?

616
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,420
When we got on the Ferris wheel, Onee-san got sick.

617
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,610
What? So how is she?

618
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,650
Uh, she's in pain and holding her head.

619
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,920
She is saying something,

620
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,190
but we are not understanding what she's saying.

621
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,470
I'm taking notes!

622
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,860
Mitsuhiko-kun is taking notes!

623
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,930
Okay.

624
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,100
Conan-kun, please, help us quickly!

625
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,650
Conan-kun, what happened to that woman?

626
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,080
She's being carried out from the medical office.

627
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,330
Takagi-kun, let's go.

628
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,270
Yes, sir.

629
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,680
Haibara, Professor, I'm leaving things to you.

630
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,420
Then, we'll come with...

631
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,000
No! Absolutely not.

632
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,570
(People other than authorized persons
should refrain from entering)

633
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,080
Excuse me.

634
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,990
Oh, please, come here.

635
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,340
I told you earlier,

636
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,090
we will be taking her under police protection.

637
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,090
That's fine.

638
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,470
I have something to tell the police hospital

639
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,300
where she will be taken.

640
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,330
I am fairly certain that the loss of her memory was caused by

641
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,940
a severe impact to the head.

642
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,800
But it is more than that.

643
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,680
I found a very rare injury in her fornix.

644
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,610
It is right here.

645
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,790
So it is not an injury from last night's accident?

646
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,690
Yes. I think it's probably something she was born with.

647
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,710
What is its connection to this attack?

648
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,980
Because it is not a part that interferes with her daily life,

649
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,860
I don't think it matters.

650
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,850
Understood. We will let them know.

651
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,830
- So then--
- Oh, please wait.

652
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,830
There is one more thing.

653
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,370
While doing her checkup, I found this in her right eye.

654
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,350
What is that?

655
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,320
It looks like a color contact lens.

656
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,600
Yes.

657
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,420
It is a color contact lens that make her eyes look black colored.

658
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,480
- As for this...
- So we were wrong when we thought that it was an odd-eye

659
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,360
or an artificial eye.

660
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,360
I wanted to let you know, just in case.

661
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,610
Excuse me.

662
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,520
We are ready for transportation.

663
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,400
Then we shall take our leave.

664
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,630
Yes.

665
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,110
Thank you very much.

666
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,830
Hey, don't you need to go with them?

667
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,310
Yeah, I just had one more question.

668
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,550
What is it?

669
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,140
About that color contact lens you talked about earlier,

670
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,160
if only one of her eyes looks black it means that

671
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,200
both her eyes must be originally blue, isn't it?

672
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,220
Yes, but only her right eye is transparent.

673
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,790
Transparent?

674
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,110
No, it would be more accurate to say that it looks transparent.

675
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,860
(Iris  Sclera)

676
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,900
It's very rare.

677
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,640
Her iris is almost the same color as her sclera.

678
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,890
Because of that, her eye looks as if it is transparent.

679
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,010
But then, it doesn't change the fact that

680
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,100
- the left and right eyes are of different colors.
- If I were to explain it a bit more clearly...

681
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:29,520
Doctor, thank you very much for everything today.

682
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,820
Huh is just this much fine?

683
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Yeah. Bye.

684
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,460
Bye. Take care.

685
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,600
Is this the place

686
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,680
where my client is?

687
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,990
Sir, this area is restricted for everyone
other than authorized people!

688
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,840
But I'm telling you, I am one of those authorized people.

689
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,300
Uncle Kogoro,

690
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,730
what are you doing?

691
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,460
Just in time, kid!

692
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,810
Where is my beautiful client?

693
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,130
She's gone.

694
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,360
She was taken to the police hospital just now.

695
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,060
And she is not your client.

696
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,170
What?

697
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,350
You didn't listen to Ran-Neechan properly, did you?

698
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,590
Do you still have a reason to be here?

699
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,080
N-No, no...

700
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,760
What's going on?

701
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,920
I don't know.

702
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,730
I thought there was something wrong with her.

703
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,920
It seems like she has amnesia.

704
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,690
So, where is she now?

705
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,910
She has been taken to the police hospital.

706
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,970
So, the police got involved too, huh.

707
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,490
Yeah. And something else has caught my attention.

708
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,550
What is it?

709
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,850
Apparently, while riding the Ferris wheel,

710
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,150
she had an attack.

711
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,340
An attack?

712
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,180
Yes.

713
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,610
All right, continue monitoring her.

714
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,730
Roger.

715
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,630
Attack on the Ferris wheel. It couldn't be...

716
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,240
(Detective Mouri's Agency)

717
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,900
Why does Haibara hate Onee-san so much?

718
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,060
Right?

719
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,460
She was angrier than she had ever been before.

720
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,580
Professor, do you know why she was angry?

721
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,720
About that...

722
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,550
I tried to ask her what was wrong,
but she said she wasn't feeling well and went home.

723
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,920
Ayumi-chan, there's no point in asking Professor.

724
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,310
That's right.

725
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,810
Professor is always getting scolded.

726
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,270
Yes, he is.

727
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,010
By the way,

728
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,760
I got this from Conan-kun.

729
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,900
This is...

730
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,680
That's the same doll we got at the darts booth.

731
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,180
But why is there no paint on it?

732
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,010
Conan-kun said something, but I forgot.

733
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,870
It's fine.

734
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,220
I'll ask him directly.

735
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,510
Who is that?

736
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,860
Oh, speak of the devil. It's Conan-kun.

737
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,580
Hello?

738
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,450
Professor, are you still with the kids?

739
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,750
Oh, we were just having tea at Poirot.

740
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,440
Okay, I have a question and a favor to ask you.

741
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,340
More importantly, is that lady okay?

742
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,480
She was taken to the police hospital earlier,

743
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,340
(Call Record End Speaker ON)

744
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,360
So, she is okay now.

745
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,680
Good.

746
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,620
- So then, what did you want from me?
- We should all go visit her.

747
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,460
Yes.

748
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,430
I wanted you to restore the internal data
of the phone she had.

749
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,080
No problem, but

750
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,910
I can't say for sure if we can perfectly recover the data.

751
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,400
I know. Also, when she had an attack on the Ferris wheel,

752
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,240
it seems like she was saying something.

753
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,260
I wanted to know what it is.

754
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,640
Regarding that, it was just from the middle but

755
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,550
I took a note of them.

756
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:40,930
Let's see. She said Stout, Aquavit, and Riesling.

757
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,450
What does that mean?

758
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,000
- Names of alcoholic beverages? Could it be...?
- Do you know what it is, Conan-kun?

759
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,070
Professor, you are at Poirot, right?

760
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,080
Huh? Y-Yeah...

761
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,740
Then can I talk to Amuro-san?

762
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,800
Amuro-san? Oh yeah, I haven't seen him today.

763
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,670
Amuro-san has the day off today.

764
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,250
He suddenly called this morning and asked

765
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,250
if he could take the day off and ended the call.

766
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,390
I tried calling back a few times,

767
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,250
but couldn't reach him, so I'm worried.

768
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,520
That is how it is.

769
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,150
I hope it's nothing, but it is worrisome.

770
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,280
Amuro-san? Could it be...

771
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,800
(LONDON)

772
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,610
Stout here. I'm on the bus.

773
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,160
Await further instructions.

774
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,030
Roger that.

775
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,520
Stout, I believed you. Too bad.

776
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,300
Stout is dead.

777
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,260
Okay, now come back immediately.

778
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,260
Understood.

779
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,100
(TORONTO)

780
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,190
For 32 years, the CN tower

781
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,610
was the tallest tower in the world.

782
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:21,530
The edge-walk takes you all around the 116th floor of the tower.

783
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:27,460
Putting you 356 meters above the ground. Now the-

784
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,960
Look the black helicopter.

785
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,130
That helicopter, it can't be...

786
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,550
Disgraceful.

787
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,140
It's the perfect way to die for a spy.

788
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,320
I have killed Aquavit.

789
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,750
As expected of you. Now come back immediately.

790
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,600
I was going to do just that even if you didn't tell me to.

791
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,060
(BERLIN)

792
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,640
Hey, hey! How far are you planning on going?

793
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,820
I told you I'd give you a minute.

794
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,390
I told you.

795
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,810
I'm not an NOC.

796
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,550
Then, let us make this clear, shall we?

797
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,720
Okay, Riesling?

798
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,300
Gin...

799
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,310
Let's clarify the positions of

800
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,230
the other side and our side.

801
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,720
Spit out the name

802
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,940
of the person who is conspiring with you.

803
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,720
Spit it out already.

804
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,040
You don't want to suffer, do you?

805
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,030
Don't make me say it again and again.

806
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,250
I'm not an NOC.

807
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,690
It is no use threatening me, Gin.

808
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,790
Threat? Do you think I'd do something that cute?

809
00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:03,640
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

810
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,950
Let's go. Hurry up.

811
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,920
Where?

812
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,030
Japan.

813
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,480
No way.

814
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,460
There's two left now.

815
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,900
MI6, UK.

816
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,080
CSIS, Canada.

817
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,350
BND, Germany.

818
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,140
Intelligence agents from various countries
were assassinated one after the other.

819
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,710
No way!

820
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,200
The only thing common between them
is that they has all infiltrated the organization.

821
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,030
Does that mean that the Black Organization did it?

822
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,760
Akai-san reported that an agent of the organization
was suspected to steal data

823
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,470
from the National Police Agency.

824
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,410
An agent of the organization.

825
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,550
Ms. Jodie,

826
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,290
you've summoned me because

827
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,840
I've been in contact with someone you believe
to be the agent, right?

828
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,990
Yes.

829
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,290
I see. But she has amnesia.

830
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,100
The phone that could be the recording medium was broken too.

831
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,250
A smart phone? Did she possess one?

832
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,340
Yeah. She left it on a bench, so I kept it for her.

833
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,460
Then we should send it to the FBI headquarters for analysis.

834
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,990
We should.

835
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,550
Wait. Professor said that
he has almost finished recovering the data.

836
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,790
It will be faster if we just let him continue.

837
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,860
Then let me know as soon as you have analyzed it.

838
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,560
If we don't find out how much information has been leaked

839
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,700
as soon as possible,

840
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,030
the whole world will be plunged into panic.

841
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,820
What sort of data was stolen?

842
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,640
Non-official cover.

843
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,630
That is...!

844
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,970
Yes, the NOC list.

845
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,480
It is the list of all the spies in the world
that the National Police Agency has.

846
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,070
That means...

847
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,740
all spies infiltrating the organization will be eliminated.

848
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,270
And that is not all.

849
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,690
If the NOC list is disclosed,

850
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:13,970
Intelligence agencies around the world could collapse.

851
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,170
That's...

852
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,010
they have obtained the key to the intelligence war.

853
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,150
Correct. If it comes to that,

854
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,810
the three assassinations this time

855
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,980
might just be the beginning.

856
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,280
We're really here.

857
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,370
But I wonder if it was okay to keep it a secret
from Ai-chan and Conan-kun.

858
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,340
It's okay. If we told them, they absolutely would not allow us.

859
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,310
For now, let's just go.

860
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:50,550
Though we don't know if we can see her or not.

861
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,270
That's right... the Touto Metropolitan Police Hospital.

862
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,930
If something happens, don't worry. I'm counting on you, Kazami.

863
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,170
Yes, sir.

864
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,900
Bourbon, why are you here?

865
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,760
To bring her back of course.

866
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:20,270
I thought you were here to shut her up
before she regained her memories.

867
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,740
Why would I do that?

868
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,520
I don't understand what you're talking about.

869
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,070
Then how are you planning to contact her?

870
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:32,230
She's under heavy guard. No visitors allowed.

871
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,040
Or do you think you can meet her easily?

872
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,010
For example, via a special connection to the police?

873
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

874
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,810
Well, that's okay. It's no good just standing around talking.

875
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,550
Let us go somewhere else.

876
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,860
If that is the order of the organization, then so be it.

877
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,500
How was it?

878
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,660
We can't go in.

879
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,400
Looks like she can't meet anyone.

880
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,760
Really?

881
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,930
Is she that sick?

882
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,750
We'll just need to find that out.

883
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,670
But how?

884
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,910
Using this.

885
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,090
I see!

886
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:13,740
(Detective Takagi, Phone, Email, Show Details)

887
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,100
Yeah, he's our strong ally.

888
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,060
Professor!

889
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,940
How's the data recovery going?

890
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,390
I think I can recover the most recent transmission data.

891
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,030
Please hurry.

892
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,210
O-Okay.

893
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,310
How about this?

894
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:38,880
You can't put it there, Genta-kun.

895
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,320
Oh, I made a mistake. Oh, Detective Takagi!

896
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,590
It's true. He's finally back.

897
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,500
How's Onee-san?

898
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,010
Can we meet her?

899
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,710
Be quiet. You're here in secret.

900
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,570
Who is here in secret?

901
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,100
Oh, sorry!

902
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,610
It's just my habit.

903
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,210
Onee-san!

904
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,480
Good to see that you're okay.

905
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,720
Your head doesn't hurt anymore?

906
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah, I'm fine now. Thank you.

907
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,750
I am not really supposed to let you see her.

908
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,360
But since she seems to get along with you guys,

909
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,230
it might even help her recover her memories.

910
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,520
- Really?
- Yay!

911
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,010
Thank you very much!

912
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:21,160
But only until the next interrogation.

913
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,000
Yes, sir!

914
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,080
Where should I put the next one?

915
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,420
Uh... how about here?

916
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,070
All right... How's that?

917
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,200
What should we do now?

918
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,890
We're in trouble.

919
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,500
- What should we do?
- We did it, Onee-san.

920
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,670
Yeah.

921
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,830
Oh, that's right. Here, this is for you.

922
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,930
This is...

923
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,880
The man from the darts booth gave it to us later.

924
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,980
He said, "Paint it in any color you want."

925
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,710
Really? Can I have it?

926
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,670
Of course, because you saved my life.

927
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,320
Onee-san, now we're the same.

928
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,350
Right?

929
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,570
What color do you want to color it in?

930
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,040
Red? Or Pink?

931
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,010
I'd paint it black and make it look like an orca.

932
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,330
I think white color suits you better than black.

933
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,100
Your hair is also white.

934
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,280
If it's white, you can keep it. It'll be a good deal.

935
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,490
You're wrong, Genta-kun.

936
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,490
Sounds like a bargain sale.

937
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,620
It's okay, isn't it?

938
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,950
Are you okay, Genta-kun?

939
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,260
Sorry, sorry.

940
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,170
Everyone, are you okay?

941
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,860
And I was finally winning...!

942
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,090
Isn't that because of Onee-san though?

943
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,400
You were just following orders, weren't you, Genta-kun?

944
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,740
Oh, yeah...

945
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,290
Excuse me.

946
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,030
I'm Kazami from Public Security Bureau.

947
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,440
I've heard the man in charge here is Inspector Megure.

948
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,810
Are you Inspector Megure?

949
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,530
Indeed, I am Megure.

950
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,110
I want you to hand over the woman
you have there as soon as possible.

951
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,340
Why? We have every right to investigate.

952
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,810
She is a suspect in the break-in at the National Police Agency.

953
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,260
We need to get a hearing on its purpose immediately.

954
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,760
If you understand,

955
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,900
I need you to start the extradition process immediately.

956
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,420
You have no authority to refuse this.

957
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,560
Certainly.

958
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,990
So then, this way please.

959
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,990
We have application forms available.

960
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,110
What's going to happen to you?

961
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,230
Who knows...

962
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,620
Your visitation with her is over.

963
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,120
Let's go home.

964
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,100
You should go back to your room too.

965
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,150
Yes.

966
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,610
Oh, are you leaving, Onee-san?

967
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,980
H-- Hey, Onee-san!

968
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,880
Thank you, everyone.

969
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,850
I'll take good care of this.

970
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,740
Yes...

971
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,330
Let's ride the Ferris wheel together again someday.

972
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,840
Yes, definitely!

973
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,890
Let's ride one.

974
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,700
Come on, let us go.

975
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,590
Will she be okay?

976
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,580
Yeah, I'm worried about her.

977
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,620
Yeah...

978
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,760
(Analyzing)

979
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,360
Shinichi, the analysis is done.

980
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,430
So, how was it?

981
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,360
Look.

982
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,960
The NOCs are Stout, Aquavit, Riesling.

983
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,580
And the ones you care about... Bourbon and Kir...

984
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,170
Damn it!

985
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,100
Professor, please analyze the receiver of the e-mail ASAP.

986
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,580
Call me as soon as you find out!

987
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,150
Haibara?

988
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,630
Don't go. Please.

989
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,600
I've told you before.

990
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,400
Don't escape from your destiny.

991
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,530
I don't want to escape from it either.

992
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,370
Kudo-kun...

993
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,830
Thank you, Detective Takagi.

994
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,030
Sorry for making you do something difficult.

995
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,940
Don't worry. Have a safe trip home.

996
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,020
Okay.

997
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,840
Genta-kun, cheer up.

998
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,490
We'll surely meet her again.

999
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,550
But...

1000
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,180
That's right! Why don't we go for a ride on the Ferris wheel?

1001
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,810
Yeah, Onee-san wanted to ride on it again too.

1002
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,070
We'll take pictures of the view and send them to her.

1003
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,180
If we go now, it'll be night.

1004
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,700
It might also be too crowded to get on.

1005
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,480
No problem about that.

1006
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,590
Touto Aquarium must have been capitalized by the Suzuki group.

1007
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,990
Look at this.

1008
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,970
Oh right!

1009
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,680
(Sonoko Nee-san, Phone, Email, Show Details)

1010
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,710
Yes, we have another strong ally.

1011
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,520
I'm afraid that we're being accused as NOCs.

1012
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,510
The NOC list that Curaçao gave me,

1013
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,820
had your names on it.

1014
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,510
Curaçao? Rum's right hand?

1015
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,730
Yeah, she's an intelligence-gathering specialist.

1016
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,320
Looks like you do know her.

1017
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,840
The color of her each eye is different.

1018
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,910
Odd eye.

1019
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,080
It is a well-known story in the organization.

1020
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,850
For the sake of our old friendship,

1021
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,380
if you come clean honestly, I will let you go without suffering.

1022
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,400
The only reason you have abducted us instead of assassinating us,

1023
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,870
is because Curaçao didn't have the complete information.

1024
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,390
Isn't that so?

1025
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,810
You're the man, Bourbon.

1026
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,580
It was great until she stole the NOC list.

1027
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,350
But she crashed on the way out and the police found her.

1028
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,260
And to top it all off, she's got amnesia.

1029
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,890
Then shouldn't you be capturing Curaçao

1030
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,980
and getting the NOC list?

1031
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,820
Gin, it shouldn't be too late to find out

1032
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,390
if we really are NOCs or not.

1033
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,090
You're right. But...

1034
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,810
- Gin.
- Brother.

1035
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,650
When in doubt, punish. That is my style.

1036
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:20,670
So then, it is time to punish the betrayers.

1037
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,140
Isn't it done yet, Professor?

1038
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,530
Don't rush.

1039
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,040
The analysis will be done in 30 seconds.

1040
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,400
Okay, once you get the address,

1041
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,030
do what I told you.

1042
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,290
Okay.

1043
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,130
I can just fake it as if it was sent

1044
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,410
from this broken smart phone, right?

1045
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,170
(Analyzing) (Completed)
Hurry up, we don't have time.

1046
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,210
Completed!

1047
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,560
He hung up already.

1048
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,170
Here. I'm sure they're coming.

1049
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,050
Anyway, read this.

1050
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,850
Th-This is...

1051
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,110
Kir!

1052
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,460
Come on, what's the matter, Kir?

1053
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,920
Continue.

1054
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,910
Your handcuffs have been removed.

1055
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,950
She's only a suspect, but also our colleague.

1056
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:17,680
It's not up to you to decide if you're on our side or not.

1057
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,690
I'll give you one last minute.

1058
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,470
Only the one who betrays the other first

1059
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,330
will get to see the dirty rat go to hell.

1060
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,990
Vodka, count.

1061
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,720
Roger.

1062
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,020
60 seconds.

1063
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,340
I'm not falling for your threats!

1064
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,550
If I say that she is an NOC,

1065
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,690
it will also mean that I am admitting to myself being one.

1066
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,440
You would never let someone like that go.

1067
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,510
50 seconds.

1068
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,860
I don't think so.

1069
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:53,740
I'm gentler than you think, Kir.

1070
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,420
40 seconds.

1071
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:02,070
So you're getting along and protecting each other, huh.

1072
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,850
Regardless of whether I'm protecting her or not,

1073
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,400
I have no idea if she is an NOC or not.

1074
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,450
Me neither.

1075
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,270
30 seconds.

1076
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,570
But I can tell you this.

1077
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,790
I am not an NOC!

1078
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,440
That's my line.

1079
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,800
So then...

1080
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,160
20 seconds.

1081
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,800
Which one's the dirty rat?

1082
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,030
Gin, are you really going to...?

1083
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,630
Who's going to cry first?

1084
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,130
Ten seconds.

1085
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,280
Nine, eight, seven...

1086
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,960
- So then, is it Bourbon?
- Six...

1087
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,170
- Five...
- Or Kir?

1088
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,600
Four, three, two, one.

1089
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,950
You are the first.

1090
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,190
Zero!

1091
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,330
Bourbon.

1092
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,720
What's that? What happened?

1093
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,530
The light!

1094
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,830
Kir, Bourbon, don't move!

1095
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,110
Ba-Bourbon's not here.

1096
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,340
He ran away.

1097
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,880
Shit! How?

1098
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,070
Catch him!

1099
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,160
Sorry, Kir.

1100
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,880
I couldn't let you show the death of the dirty rat.

1101
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,440
But you'll never be lonely.

1102
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,490
I'll send Bourbon to you soon.

1103
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,500
Good-bye, Kir.

1104
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,600
Gin, hold on!

1105
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,180
Don't shoot her!

1106
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,300
It's an order from Rum.

1107
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,240
So what do we do?

1108
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,650
Yes. I understand.

1109
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,170
There was an e-mail from Curaçao.

1110
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,230
It said that these two are not involved.

1111
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,500
Has she regained her memories?

1112
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:47,980
Well, it sounds like your suspicions about us have been cleared.

1113
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,520
Now can you take these cuffs off?

1114
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,210
You must not.

1115
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,840
Rum has more orders.

1116
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,600
She said that she needed to verify that

1117
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,710
the e-mail was really sent by Curaçao.

1118
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,430
To get her back from the police hospital,

1119
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,590
it's going to be pretty tricky.

1120
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,430
No need to worry.

1121
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,140
If my guess is correct,

1122
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,110
there should be some action starting by now.

1123
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,370
Nice timing, Gin.

1124
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,210
The Public Security Bureau dimwits
are finally taking their action.

1125
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,670
I knew it.

1126
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,770
They're so dumb that they don't even know that we've bugged them.

1127
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,830
So what's the destination?

1128
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,020
It's exactly where you'd expect it to be.

1129
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,410
She is just about to be pushed into a car right now.

1130
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,270
Get the airplane ready.

1131
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:39,970
Don't tell me...

1132
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,740
It's a good chance to test

1133
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,840
the capabilities of that.

1134
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,180
I hope you aren't trying to start a war.

1135
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,180
It's an order from Rum.

1136
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,670
We need to make sure we get the job done.

1137
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:54,590
Roger.

1138
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:58,650
This is crazy!

1139
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,660
Looks like it's going to be a lot of fun!

1140
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,060
So do I.

1141
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,580
Gin! Are you seriously going to use that?

1142
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,450
Brother, he got away.

1143
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,810
It doesn't matter.

1144
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,310
Bourbon and Kir will be dealt with later.

1145
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,070
First, we must get Curaçao back.

1146
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:19,100
But there are police
and Public Security Bureau people at the hospital.

1147
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,330
Curaçao has already left the hospital.

1148
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,800
Then where will we be going?

1149
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,690
Our destination will be Touto Aquarium.

1150
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,980
Gin, are you serious?

1151
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,190
Did you predict that this would happen and so set that trap?

1152
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,140
Vodka. Let's go. Get the car.

1153
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,250
Roger.

1154
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,070
Oh, okay.

1155
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,400
I need you to head over there now.

1156
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,630
We will rescue them.

1157
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:45,990
Yes, sir.

1158
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:47,920
Looks like they are out of danger.

1159
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,990
Good!

1160
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,170
That's great.

1161
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,350
Your plan is working.

1162
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,160
It's no big deal.

1163
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:58,270
Because that text stopped in the middle of a sentence,

1164
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,390
I just added a note to the end of it, writing that

1165
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:04,230
they weren't involved and there's no need to worry.

1166
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,490
All right. Now those two are...

1167
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:07,530
- Yeah.
- No.

1168
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,020
This is just a stopgap.

1169
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,150
The enemy's priority is to recapture the agent.

1170
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,650
They seem to have headed to Touto Aquarium.

1171
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,530
Not the police hospital?

1172
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,810
Yeah. She was taken out to the aquarium
by the Public Security Bureau.

1173
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,270
To the aquarium?

1174
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,410
Then should we too?

1175
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,680
No. Akai-kun is already on his way over there.

1176
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,860
We are going to rescue the agents left in the warehouse district

1177
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,050
and search for the NOC list.

1178
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:34,950
Yes, sir.

1179
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,040
Conan-kun,

1180
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,340
you should get off this case.

1181
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,130
We don't know what is going to happen from here onwards.

1182
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,270
But...

1183
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,320
Don't worry.

1184
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,330
We, the FBI, will definitely solve this problem.

1185
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,500
Then I'm counting on you.

1186
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,480
Yes. I will call you when it is settled.

1187
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,820
Come to think of it, Akai-san...

1188
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,350
How much did he know about that agent?

1189
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,240
He doesn't know the details.

1190
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,570
The only thing he knows about them
is that they are Rum's confidant

1191
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,180
and their code name is Curaçao.

1192
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,910
Thank you. Take care.

1193
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,100
She is not Rum, but Curaçao.

1194
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,570
Curaçao is a liquor made from the peel of an orange.

1195
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,630
The main types are white Curaçao,

1196
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,360
orange Curaçao, blue Curaçao,

1197
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,740
green Curaçao, and red Curaçao.

1198
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,270
Could it be...?

1199
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,180
I knew it. Five colors.

1200
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,680
I've seen this color scheme somewhere.

1201
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,960
But where? Think...

1202
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,220
If this is the key,

1203
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,550
I found a very rare injury

1204
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,580
in her fornix.

1205
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,420
She's in pain, holding her head.

1206
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,880
She is saying something,

1207
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,780
but we are not understanding what she's saying.

1208
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:02,970
She said Stout, Aquavit, and Riesling.

1209
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,650
I see.

1210
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,320
If my deduction is correct,

1211
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,750
it would explain the actions of the organization
and the Public Security Bureau.

1212
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,770
That means... Shit!

1213
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,020
If I don't do something now,

1214
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,350
the NOC list will end up in the hands of the organization!

1215
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,010
Yes, yes. She is in custody according to your instructions.

1216
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,030
Huh? You want us to ride on the Ferris wheel?

1217
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,640
Oh, it's not sure but,

1218
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,700
right now, we can only bet on this way.

1219
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,470
You'll do it, right?

1220
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,220
Yeah.  Well, let's meet up as soon as possible.

1221
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,530
No, I don't know how closely the organization
is keeping me under surveillance.

1222
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,540
We'll stay on this plan until you get to the Ferris wheel.

1223
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:42,970
Bye.

1224
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:44,280
Wait, Furuya-san!

1225
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,970
Damn it, even though its Golden Week,

1226
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:57,640
why do I have to come to the aquarium?

1227
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,400
And that too with a bunch of kids.

1228
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,550
Okay, we're here.

1229
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:04,160
- We've been waiting for this!
- Yay!

1230
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,340
Let's go!

1231
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,590
Wait a minute, everyone.

1232
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:07,980
Stay there.

1233
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,450
Okay

1234
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,870
What about you, dad?

1235
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:14,030
I don't feel like going to an aquarium today.

1236
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,010
I'm going to sleep here. Go have fun.

1237
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,840
Thank you.

1238
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,780
I'll go talk to them.

1239
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,910
Yes, sir.

1240
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,700
The aquarium again?

1241
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,870
I thought they were going to take her to the accident site.

1242
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:41,280
That woman had an attack on the Ferris wheel here.

1243
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,870
Maybe there is something secret there.

1244
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,660
Let us see how things go here for a while.

1245
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:48,610
Yes, sir.

1246
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:51,340
Sonoko Nee-chan isn't here yet.

1247
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,400
Yeah, I think she should be here by now.

1248
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,020
I'd like to ride on the Ferris wheel.

1249
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,570
I'm sorry, sir.

1250
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:00,030
But, today's ticket sales have already closed.

1251
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,960
Then, could you tell whoever is in charge here

1252
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,690
that the Public Security Bureau is asking for your cooperation.

1253
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,750
- I understand. please wait a moment.
- Ran!

1254
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,040
Here, here!

1255
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,090
You're finally here.

1256
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,500
Sonoko!

1257
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,260
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It took a while to complete the formalities.

1258
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,440
You did it!

1259
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,530
That's our Sonoko Nee-chan!

1260
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,350
You guys better be thankful.

1261
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:22,760
Yes.

1262
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,810
I'm sorry.

1263
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,000
I also take advantage of you.

1264
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:28,380
It's okay. It's the same work.

1265
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,590
Well, please take care of these kids.

1266
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,790
Okay. Then I will take you to the Ferris wheel.

1267
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,250
Everybody, please follow me.

1268
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,220
Yes!

1269
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,710
Is it okay to leave it to her?

1270
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:44,150
Yeah, she's an attendant here, so don't worry.

1271
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,640
By the way, is it okay for you to not invite Shinichi-kun here?

1272
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:49,370
What should we do?

1273
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,400
No, I'd rather you are on guard duty.

1274
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,770
What's the matter? Do you know them?

1275
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:56,300
No, it's not like that.

1276
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,630
But that woman with the Public Security Bureau guy...

1277
01:06:58,770 --> 01:06:59,900
I've seen her somewhere before.

1278
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,540
Public Security Bureau? Those guys?

1279
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,150
Yeah. I wonder if there's been an incident.

1280
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:10,770
What's this? So rude! Let's go.

1281
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,590
Sorry, Sonoko.

1282
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:17,520
I'm still curious about those people we saw earlier.

1283
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,010
Since it's such a rare opportunity, just call him.

1284
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,560
Oh, shoot! This phone ringing means...

1285
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,320
(Ran Mouri, Calling, Reject, Answer)
I knew it.

1286
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:38,840
What's wrong, Ran?

1287
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,770
Shinichi, can I talk to you for a second?

1288
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,120
What is it? Please make it quick.

1289
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,740
Are you busy right now?

1290
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,910
Uh... yeah.

1291
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,450
- Hey, Sonoko.
- What?

1292
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,840
Geez...

1293
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:54,680
Sorry, I'm in the middle of something. I gotta go.

1294
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,030
Wait, Shinichi!

1295
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,850
I'll call you back when I'm done.

1296
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,960
Don't tell me--

1297
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,280
- Where are you right now?
- I'm hanging up.

1298
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,000
That guy... He probably said he was busy
and hung up again, didn't he?

1299
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,360
Yes.

1300
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,390
Where is he and what is he doing?

1301
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,710
It seems as if he's here.

1302
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,560
What do you mean?

1303
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,970
I heard the announcement here from Shinichi's phone.

1304
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,110
I see. The problem is, who is he with?

1305
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,030
Are you silly?

1306
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,870
You think a man would come in here all alone?

1307
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,860
All right, we're going go catch his cheating.

1308
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,870
Hey, Sonoko.

1309
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:33,140
(CAUTION High Voltage)

1310
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,410
There is more than one power supply, right?

1311
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:41,180
The old facility was powered by a different rye.

1312
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,080
Can't be helped.

1313
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,340
I'm done.

1314
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,680
With this, even if you guys show up,
they won't be able to find you immediately.

1315
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,790
Good job.

1316
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:00,360
Hurry up. We'll take action in 15 minutes.

1317
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,890
Roger. Here we go!

1318
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:11,400
Thank you very much for taking a ride on

1319
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,150
Touto Aquarium's giant Ferris wheel.

1320
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:17,450
It is almost time for the special Water and Light Show,

1321
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,850
but due to the inspection of the North wheel

1322
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,680
boarding will now be on

1323
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:24,450
the South wheel side only.

1324
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,210
(No Entry)

1325
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,610
Here you go.

1326
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,720
- Woo-hoo!
- It's a shortcut!

1327
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,740
Hold on, guys.

1328
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,360
Who are these customers?

1329
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,530
They are Suzuki-sama's acquaintances.

1330
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,500
So, will we be renting out one side of the wheel for these kids?

1331
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,970
I guess so.

1332
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:50,700
Damn!

1333
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,770
It's impossible to find them in this condition.

1334
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,000
Somehow, I've got to stop it before they get on it.

1335
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,650
Please. Enjoy.

1336
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,850
Just what are the Public Security Bureau guys doing?

1337
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,590
Hey, something big is going on here.

1338
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,280
Did something happen?

1339
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,610
This is...

1340
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,070
Where are you, Kudo-kun?

1341
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:25,960
I knew it!

1342
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:28,240
That Ferris wheel?

1343
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,170
They are from the Public Security Bureau.

1344
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,970
By any chance, is the renting out of one side...

1345
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,050
Yes. It is our request.

1346
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,400
I am sorry, sir.

1347
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,770
I made a mistake. About ten minutes ago,

1348
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,220
I let some kid guests ride on it.

1349
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,350
What should we do?

1350
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,770
Should we wait till they come back?

1351
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,060
No, if it's just kids, it doesn't matter.

1352
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:52,970
More importantly, now that we have secured the Ferris wheel,

1353
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,880
I am sure that they will take action

1354
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,490
when we are back on the ground.

1355
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,490
Keep tight security.

1356
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:00,540
Yes, sir.

1357
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,800
Then let us go.

1358
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,340
I'm sorry. I got separated from my friends.

1359
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,640
Please let me through.

1360
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,290
Wait! You mustn't ride on it!

1361
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,530
Whoa! You can't come in here.

1362
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:17,360
Shit, I'm one step too late, huh.

1363
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:24,350
Sorry. Please let me through.

1364
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,330
If they're going to take action,

1365
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,230
it must inside this Ferris wheel

1366
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:39,190
where it's less visible and less guarded.

1367
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,090
I need to expose the plan as soon as possible

1368
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,850
by telling it to the Public Security Bureau and the FBI.

1369
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,690
Is that Akai-san?

1370
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,500
What are all those cables for?

1371
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,410
No way. If that's the case...!

1372
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,350
This is bad! I must check it out right now!

1373
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:02,290
There she is. It's just as planned.

1374
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,730
Check Curaçao on the gondola.

1375
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,440
The fellow passenger is a Public Security Bureau officer.

1376
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:10,930
It will take about ten minutes to reach the top.

1377
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,270
Ten minutes, huh.

1378
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,710
How is it going, Vodka?

1379
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,330
I'm ready to go anytime.

1380
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:17,730
How about the other Public Security Bureau guys?

1381
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:21,100
Looks like a few of them are keeping guard in each section,

1382
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,650
but I'm sure they won't interfere with our plans.

1383
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,950
Then we'll go on your signal.

1384
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,810
Roger.

1385
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:32,980
You bastard, do you really not remember me?

1386
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,070
Yes.

1387
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,230
Well, fine.

1388
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,730
When your memory comes back, I'll torture you as much as I can

1389
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,610
and make you spit out

1390
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:44,630
where the NOC list is hidden
and get out information on the organization from you.

1391
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,120
This should give me a head start.

1392
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,380
There you are.

1393
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,590
Looks like you managed to escape successfully.

1394
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,850
If he's here, that means...

1395
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,160
I knew it.

1396
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,650
What? What's wrong?

1397
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,540
You shot down the lights

1398
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,790
and took out their vision.

1399
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,580
Kir, Bourbon!

1400
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:31,070
You realized that I was still stuck inside the warehouse.

1401
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,180
Catch him!

1402
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,810
You opened the door with force

1403
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,680
and fooled them

1404
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,940
by making it seem as if I had escaped outside.

1405
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,390
Sorry, Kir.

1406
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,980
Thanks to that I could hide in the shadows

1407
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,320
and monitor what they were up to.

1408
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,010
If that was your doing,

1409
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,670
I knew that you would eventually come here.

1410
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,410
Can you tell me

1411
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,710
why you saved our lives?

1412
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,160
Even if you didn't take that sort of risk,

1413
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:03,910
you could have snooped on them, couldn't you?

1414
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,700
Did you come all the way down here to chat with me?

1415
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,910
Yeah. I'm here to tell the FBI to back out of this case.

1416
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,440
Curaçao will be given to us, Public Security Bureau.

1417
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,200
What If I said no?

1418
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:21,120
We will just take it by force them.

1419
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,880
Pull out, Shuichi Akai!

1420
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,310
I can't believe these many electrical cables
lead to a fire hydrant.

1421
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:39,330
It's strange no matter how one thinks of it.

1422
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,750
It's not a good idea to just open it either.

1423
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,400
If I open it from here...

1424
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,000
Is that a detonator?

1425
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:50,920
So that means,

1426
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,250
the things at the end of the cables that are attached to the axle

1427
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,120
are probably bombs.

1428
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:01,230
What should I do? It's a remote-controlled detonator.

1429
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,910
If I carelessly cause a stir and they find out,

1430
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:04,970
it'll be the end.

1431
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:08,350
Oh, yeah. He's here!

1432
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:15,150
- Thank you for waiting.
- What's going on?

1433
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,450
- There's no one on board? No way!
- So then, the special Water and Light Show

1434
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,240
- Night Program will now begin!
- Why are the kids there?!

1435
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,480
I told you, Amuro-kun.

1436
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,540
Don't misjudge who you are hunting.

1437
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,610
Yeah, I'm going to hunt them all down.

1438
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,610
After I've defeated you!

1439
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,540
What if, while we are doing this,

1440
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,550
Curaçao's memories come back

1441
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,300
and they try to attack us?

1442
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,170
Why don't you say it clearly?

1443
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:20,990
that you can't trust the Japanese police
from whom information was stolen.

1444
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:26,310
Damn! Where did Akai-san go?

1445
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,730
Please, answer to phone!

1446
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,550
Is he there?

1447
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,800
Where?

1448
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:06,810
That's enough.

1449
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,680
Have you given up already?

1450
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,420
Come on, let's go for round two.

1451
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,660
Akai-san!

1452
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:19,740
I know you're here!

1453
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,740
There's a big problem. I need your help.

1454
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,920
If they fail to retake Curaçao...

1455
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,930
they're going to blow up this whole Ferris wheel with bombs!

1456
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,880
Please! If you're there, give me a hand!

1457
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:32,880
If we don't disarm the bombs

1458
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,790
before they do, it'll be really bad!

1459
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,380
Is that really true, Conan-kun?

1460
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,970
Amuro-san, how did you get here?

1461
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,660
I'll explain that later.

1462
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,450
More importantly, where are the bombs?

1463
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:45,100
There are countless bombs planted between the axle and the wheel!

1464
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,270
It's remotely controlled.
We don't know when it is going to blow up!

1465
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,350
We need to disarm it as soon as possible!

1466
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,920
All right! I'll be right there with the FBI!

1467
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:58,560
Yes.

1468
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,940
That was so beautiful!

1469
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,620
Cheer up, Ran.

1470
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,570
I'lldefinitely find him for you.

1471
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,120
No, it's not that.

1472
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,310
If he's investigating, I'm going to get him in trouble.

1473
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,220
You are really generous,

1474
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,700
you know that?

1475
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,610
Look, I'm going to catch his cheating!

1476
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,790
That's enough, Sonoko.

1477
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,910
That's no good!

1478
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:26,390
We haven't checked out the best places yet.

1479
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,480
The best place?

1480
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,720
Yeah, right there.

1481
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:33,860
The aquarium?

1482
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,120
That's right.

1483
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,410
How's it going, Amuro-san?

1484
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,650
Almost there.

1485
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:49,240
With this, everything will be okay.

1486
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,910
So they had set up a trap after all.

1487
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:57,030
You made the right decision by not opening it.

1488
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,980
Akai-san, where are the bombs?

1489
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,630
They're C-4. They are planted quite well.

1490
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:06,800
If everything explodes at the same time,

1491
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,740
the axle will not be able to bear the load

1492
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,340
and that will lead to a chain collapse.

1493
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:12,420
I see.

1494
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,760
Looks like there is no time to just worry over things.

1495
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,200
Is this?

1496
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,770
How is it? Can you disarm it?

1497
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,470
No problem. It's a common type.

1498
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,570
I know how to disarm it.

1499
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,190
You know a lot about bombs, don't you, Amuro-san?

1500
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,280
My friend from the police academy taught me a lot.

1501
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,040
He later became the ace of the bomb squad.

1502
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,360
Well, in the end,

1503
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:40,960
during the dismantling of a bomb planted on a Ferris wheel,

1504
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,180
he got killed by the bomb.

1505
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,010
By dismantling a bomb on a Ferris wheel?

1506
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,450
Don't worry. His technique was flawless.

1507
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,660
I'll show you how perfect he was.

1508
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,070
Use this.

1509
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:55,990
There are tools in there.

1510
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,840
I'll leave the dismantling to you.

1511
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,180
Where are you...?

1512
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,200
The fact than there are bombs here

1513
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,040
means that they will definitely use
this Ferris wheel to take action.

1514
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,770
And the only route they can retake Curaçao

1515
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:11,370
without incurring damage from the bombs is...

1516
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:12,910
From the sky!

1517
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,950
Correct. I'll go back to where I was and buy us some time.

1518
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:20,030
Do whatever it takes to disarm the bombs.

1519
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,910
That's easy to say.

1520
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,570
Amuro-san, take this.

1521
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,680
Oh, thank you.

1522
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,510
Now we just need to see

1523
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,790
how much time he can buy to dismantle this.

1524
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:32,620
Indeed.

1525
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,810
We don't know when it's going to explode...

1526
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,630
No, wait.

1527
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,590
They're going to take action at...

1528
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,830
What's the matter, Conan-kun?

1529
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,620
We have to protect the NOC list!

1530
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,120
Goddamn it, all of them.

1531
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,910
This is it. These rifles are

1532
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:01,820
the same number of colors
as the five color films that Curaçao had.

1533
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,990
And unlike in the daytime,

1534
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,620
even the transparent is almost the same.

1535
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,460
If I'm right,

1536
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,870
when Curaçao saw this color scheme and density,

1537
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,290
it reminded her of the NOC list.

1538
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:14,330
In other words,

1539
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:16,240
her brain is a storage medium.

1540
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:20,380
and the trigger for that memory is

1541
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,620
when the gondola reaches the top.

1542
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:25,350
If she see this perfect color scheme and density,

1543
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,310
this time, her memory will be back completely.

1544
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,110
It's about time.

1545
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,430
Gin, final confirmation.

1546
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,910
It starts in three minutes.

1547
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,140
Ready?

1548
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,520
Anytime is fine. You can start.

1549
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:46,160
Chianti, stand by Conto Alpha.

1550
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:49,000
Now, switch to silent mode.

1551
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,280
Roger.

1552
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,210
I must disarm it as soon as possible

1553
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,920
and meet up with Kazama.

1554
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,590
I believe this is the next one...

1555
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,000
Phew! That was close.

1556
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,070
If this lights up, we are over.

1557
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:16,000
Impatience was the biggest trap of all, isn't it Matsuda?

1558
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,440
What in the world is going on?

1559
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,070
We're almost halfway round.

1560
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,060
If it wasn't for the fireworks earlier...

1561
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,000
So the information from Furuya-san was wrong?

1562
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,480
Hey, what's the matter?

1563
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,420
Stop it! Calm down!

1564
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,680
What's happening?

1565
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:54,830
I thought she had regained her memories.

1566
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,680
Don't tell me, the e-mail that Rum got...

1567
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,040
Calm down! Sit down!

1568
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,900
Stop it!

1569
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,850
You're wrong, Curaçao.

1570
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,640
With that special brain of yours,

1571
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:19,350
you've memorized facts that are inconvenient to the organization.

1572
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,630
Your abilities are impressive,

1573
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:25,210
but if you use them in the wrong way,

1574
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,120
you could become a great threat for us.

1575
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,840
That's why, you understand, right?

1576
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,390
This is your destiny after all.

1577
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,010
Goodbye, Curaçao.

1578
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,050
Wait.

1579
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:42,960
What?

1580
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,680
Why are you here?

1581
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,920
Stand down, Vermouth.

1582
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,470
Curaçao, you have no color.

1583
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,420
You only have pure black darkness.

1584
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:07,190
R... Rum.

1585
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:07,800
(CODE NAME RUM NO.002)

1586
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,540
If that darkness is what is tormenting you,

1587
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:12,710
you can dye yourself in any other color you want.

1588
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,970
Put your special ability to use just for me,

1589
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,680
along with the inputs and outputs.

1590
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:25,150
And be my right-hand, Curaçao.

1591
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,510
Hey, you okay? Pull yourself together.

1592
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:35,310
Damn it! Hang on. I'll call an ambulance right away.

1593
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,530
You don't have to do that.

1594
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,430
I knew her memories had returned.

1595
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,190
Curaçao has entered the trapping area.

1596
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,990
Two minutes to the top.

1597
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:58,310
I think it's time you start.

1598
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,210
Vodka, put out the arms.

1599
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,260
Roger.

1600
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,570
Hatch open.

1601
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,580
This rotor sound. It should already be getting close.

1602
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:35,480
Just what are they planning to do?

1603
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,760
No way.

1604
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,330
Who is it?

1605
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,570
Long time no see, Vermouth.

1606
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,400
Your memory is back after all, right?

1607
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,710
Yeah, I was just wondering when you are going to come to get me.

1608
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,980
It seems like there are
tons of Public Security Bureau officers out there.

1609
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,390
That's no problem.

1610
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:06,160
Gin will pick you up soon.

1611
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:07,480
Gin?

1612
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:10,670
Yeah. By the way, when did you get your memory back?

1613
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:14,310
I've heard that Rum got an email from your phone.

1614
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:18,230
But if that is not an email sent by you,

1615
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,760
That e-mail? Of course, I sent it.

1616
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,390
Is there a problem?

1617
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,810
I see. If that's the case,

1618
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,330
Kir and Bourbon are not involved.

1619
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,660
Is it that he ran away because he didn't want to
get killed for no reason?

1620
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,210
It's about time, Cinderella.

1621
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,780
Stay there and wait for the pumpkin carriage.

1622
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:39,100
Okay.

1623
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:40,800
Five seconds.

1624
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:44,700
Three, two, one, zero.

1625
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,780
(run a program)

1626
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,000
Oh!

1627
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,110
What?

1628
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,470
Shit! It's started!

1629
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,410
Confirm the signal from Vermouth.

1630
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:06,400
The ground has been shrouded in darkness.

1631
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,670
Okay. Start descent immediately.

1632
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,410
Take Curaçao!

1633
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:12,750
Roger.

1634
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:17,190
Please stay calm! It's okay!

1635
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,890
Please do not move around as it is dangerous!

1636
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,670
Look at that!

1637
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:24,040
The aquarium's got lights.

1638
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,340
Hey, let's go over there.

1639
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,390
Hey, everyone, let's go!

1640
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:29,750
No! It's not safe! Please don't move!

1641
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,000
I have a bad feeling.

1642
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:42,290
I have to get the kids out of here.

1643
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,600
What? A blackout at this time?

1644
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,130
We have no luck, do we?

1645
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:49,020
And we had almost made it down there too.

1646
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:50,270
How about it?

1647
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:51,850
No use. I can't reach him.

1648
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,770
What is Kazami-san doing?

1649
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,940
Sato-kun, Takagi-kun.

1650
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:01,290
It looks like the Public Security Bureau people
don't have a clue of what is going on either.

1651
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,310
As a thought.

1652
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,670
Then what should we do?

1653
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:06,060
I will offer to cooperate.

1654
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,330
But they are...

1655
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,540
At times like this,

1656
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:12,030
we should not confront each other
just because of organizational differences. Okay?

1657
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,070
Yes.

1658
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:15,860
He doesn't seem to be here as well.

1659
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:18,100
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

1660
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,530
It probably was just my misunderstanding.

1661
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,180
Hey, look outside! Outside!

1662
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,730
Something terrible is happening!

1663
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:27,110
Please give way!

1664
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,610
Excuse me, please let me see!

1665
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,390
This is...

1666
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,490
What happened?

1667
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,820
It's hard to tell the wires in the dark.

1668
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,620
I was this close to disarming it...

1669
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,270
They've taken my vision at a crucial moment.

1670
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,530
If I just sit here, I can get back to the organization...

1671
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,380
It can't be... Are they going to get her with the whole gondola?

1672
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:07,080
What's that?

1673
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:11,000
Control. No problem.

1674
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,900
20 m to the target. Let's keep going.

1675
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,820
A Public Security Bureau agent. That means...

1676
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,350
It was Curaçao who jumped out earlier.

1677
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:24,990
Oh no!

1678
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:29,950
Hey, mister, wake up! Mister!

1679
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,840
I don't think this rifle is going to stand a chance.

1680
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,500
But there has got to be a weak spot somewhere.

1681
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,240
Shit!

1682
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,330
Can I make it at this distance?

1683
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:02,440
All right, let's leave.

1684
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:03,600
Roger.

1685
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,760
At 8 o'clock,

1686
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,680
something on the Ferris wheel moved just now.

1687
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,650
Is the Public Security Bureau agent on the run?

1688
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:11,840
Search the gondola with a heat sensor.

1689
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,880
Roger.

1690
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:16,830
This form is of a man.

1691
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,210
And there's also a kid in there.

1692
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,440
Brother, Curaçao is not on board.

1693
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,450
What?

1694
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:26,070
Curaçao... Abandon the gondola.

1695
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:27,340
Roger.

1696
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:31,260
You're kidding me, right?!

1697
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:45,930
Gin, what's going on?

1698
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,570
Curaçao has disappeared.

1699
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:49,880
Change of plans.

1700
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,140
We will kill Curaçao.

1701
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,570
You're so impatient.

1702
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,580
We are not sure if she has betrayed us.

1703
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,460
Can you think of a reason for her leaving the gondola

1704
01:30:56,770 --> 01:30:58,510
other than for running away?

1705
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:00,910
Find Curaçao right away.

1706
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:01,660
Roger.

1707
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,030
Chianti, get away from the Ferris wheel.

1708
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,040
Roger.

1709
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,270
Korn, prepare the IDWS.

1710
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,440
Understood.

1711
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:24,990
Could it be...?

1712
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,070
What?

1713
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,390
Are you going to take me back to them?

1714
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,320
Them? Do you mean the organization?

1715
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:42,660
Her memory has returned after all.

1716
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,560
Are you

1717
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:46,610
Sherry who betrayed the organization.

1718
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,750
Come on. Let's escape from here. It's not safe here.

1719
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,480
What do you mean by escape?

1720
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,360
If it's a bad joke, stop it.

1721
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,480
Gin is coming.

1722
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:59,630
You know what that means, right?

1723
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,030
But why me?

1724
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,330
I don't know.

1725
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:05,680
I don't know why I helped you.

1726
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:10,080
But I'm Curaçao who can take on any color.

1727
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:11,850
I feel better about myself now than

1728
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,210
I did before.

1729
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,840
That is all.

1730
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,020
Come on. Let's go, Sherry-chan.

1731
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,480
Wait!

1732
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:25,890
The kids are still in the gondola!

1733
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,630
We must hurry up and get them out!

1734
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,490
I don't know what happened, but this will be fine.

1735
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,080
Okay. I can identify the cables and the blasting cap.

1736
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:42,070
Concentrate. Don't panic and be careful. And hurry up.

1737
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,740
Hey, mister!

1738
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,650
Mister, pull yourself together!

1739
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,130
This is bad!

1740
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:57,840
Not yet?

1741
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,310
You still haven't found Curaçao?

1742
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,700
There are some moving shadows inside the Ferris wheel.

1743
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:05,180
Two kids and adults...

1744
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:06,900
This is bad!

1745
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,980
Brother, someone is there near the detonator!

1746
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:10,910
What?

1747
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:11,950
See? here.

1748
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:15,250
We had installed it in this fire hydrant.

1749
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,080
Has Public Security Bureau noticed that?

1750
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,540
All I have to do is cut these two cables
leading to the blasting cap.

1751
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:28,600
All right. If I cut this one, it'll be done.

1752
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,400
(RECEPTION OFF)

1753
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:37,530
I did it!

1754
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:41,430
That was so close!

1755
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:55,060
Let's rain down on them, Korn. With a rain of bullets.

1756
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,630
It has to be this way! Get them, Korn!

1757
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,620
Okay!

1758
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,470
What's going on?

1759
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,990
Shit! I've got to do something about that!

1760
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,370
No good. I must hurry.

1761
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,760
I can't make it from above, huh.

1762
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,370
I still can't reach him.

1763
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:33,360
Since everyone's calling,
it's probably making it harder to connect.

1764
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:36,100
Are the kids okay?

1765
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:40,060
Hurry! Jump! Run away!

1766
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:58,690
Shit, as soon as I move, they'll shoot me.

1767
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,550
I can't do anything in this condition.

1768
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,610
Their target is me.

1769
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,860
Don't tell me... are you going to act as a decoy?

1770
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:08,860
I'll leave the kids to you.

1771
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:10,920
No! You'll be killed!

1772
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:19,520
This movement. This form. It's undoubtedly Curaçao.

1773
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:26,660
The attack is concentrating in one place.

1774
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:30,810
Someone must be the target. Now's the time to move.

1775
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,280
Go to hell, Curaçao!

1776
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,240
No way...

1777
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,380
Curaçao's reaction is gone.

1778
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:07,120
Mission completed.

1779
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,010
No, not yet.

1780
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,960
The dirty rats are still out there.

1781
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:14,310
Aim at the axle bombs.

1782
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:16,650
A-Axle?

1783
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:19,330
Yeah. If it was Curaçao,

1784
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,830
she could have escaped while taking advantage of the chaos

1785
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:23,710
of the Ferris wheel collapse. But if it's just the

1786
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:26,840
Public Security Bureau officer,
it will be a good shooting practice.

1787
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:29,630
Korn, fill ammo immediately

1788
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:30,860
and blow away the axle.

1789
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,100
Get this done before the Air Self-Defense Force gets here.

1790
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:35,100
Okay. Will do.

1791
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,840
Haibara-san!

1792
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,260
Is everyone okay?

1793
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,090
Ai-chan, what's going on here?

1794
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:47,170
I'll explain everything later.

1795
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:48,780
Just be quiet for now.

1796
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:49,950
Yes.

1797
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:53,660
Akai-san! Amuro-san!

1798
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:54,860
This way.

1799
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:56,540
Akai-san!

1800
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,620
Are you injured?

1801
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:01,620
No.

1802
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:02,960
Hide.

1803
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:04,800
I can still hear the sound of rotors.

1804
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:07,260
Where is Amuro-san?

1805
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,740
I don't know.

1806
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,030
But the fact that they have launched a direct attack

1807
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,080
means that the bombs were successfully disarmed.

1808
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:16,510
Now we just need to figure out how to get them.

1809
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:18,560
Is that rifle just a decoration?

1810
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,590
Amuro-san!

1811
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:25,070
Is there no way to fight back, FBI?

1812
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,720
There is. However...

1813
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:29,630
My night vision scope has gone bad.

1814
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,730
I can use it for this normal scope that I had in reserve.

1815
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:37,440
But I can't shoot down a big iron dark crow with this.

1816
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,580
Can you shoot it down if you can see it?

1817
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,720
Yeah.

1818
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,980
But how?

1819
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,540
If I aim at the joint of the rotor, I will probably get it.

1820
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,820
I couldn't see the joint.

1821
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,920
You cannot see it from the front.

1822
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:51,830
If we could manage to change the angle of the aircraft,

1823
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:55,410
and still get five seconds of light around the rotor...

1824
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,800
I could illuminate it, but

1825
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:59,800
I need to know the rough outline of the aircraft

1826
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:00,950
around the rotor.

1827
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,190
No way! Are they going to blow up the axle?

1828
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:14,090
They are trying to collapse the Ferris wheel.

1829
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,470
Oh, no. There still are half number of bombs around the axle.

1830
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,130
Fire, fire, fire!

1831
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:27,550
Shit! I know which way they're shooting at

1832
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:29,410
but I don't know where the rotor is!

1833
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:32,020
You just need to know the rough outline, right?

1834
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,140
All right.

1835
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:37,770
Don't miss it!

1836
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:42,940
(PROGRAM RUN)

1837
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:47,350
I can see it!

1838
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,400
Go on!!

1839
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,340
What's that light?!

1840
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,380
Fireworks!

1841
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:17,520
What on earth is that?!

1842
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:18,740
Fireworks?

1843
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:19,670
We're under attack!

1844
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,330
Just where did it come from?

1845
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,390
Fall down.

1846
01:39:34,450 --> 01:39:35,310
Did he make it?

1847
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,660
All right!

1848
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,360
This is bad! This is bad!

1849
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,460
We're going to crash at this rate!

1850
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,460
Korn, move!

1851
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:53,700
Damn!

1852
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:58,650
If the axle's destroyed, we'll be in big trouble!

1853
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:39,930
Impossible! We're leaving!

1854
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,970
Run away!!

1855
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:46,110
Run away!

1856
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:47,770
- Get away from here!
- Run!

1857
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:55,000
This is bad! If it rolls down, it'll crash into the aquarium!

1858
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:03,690
But who are these people?

1859
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:08,410
I don't give a shit about the people who are dying.

1860
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,340
Customers, please move to the dolphin show stadium!

1861
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:14,720
It's not safe here!

1862
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:15,770
The Ferris wheel...

1863
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,620
Ran, we have to go!

1864
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:33,130
Damn it! It's falling down and accelerating!

1865
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,270
Conan-kun!

1866
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,440
Amuro-san!

1867
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:39,000
Can you stop it?

1868
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,060
I don't know, but I must try!

1869
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:48,050
Amuro-san!

1870
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,730
It's okay. Concentrate!

1871
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:53,280
Let's go!

1872
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:05,090
Come on!

1873
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:10,990
Akai-san...?

1874
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:12,770
You must have a plan, right?

1875
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:32,630
How about this?

1876
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,560
Okay. No wait, not yet.

1877
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:40,890
- No, I can't stop it!
- Hurry, Sonoko!

1878
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:42,000
Get out of here!

1879
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:43,510
This won't stop it.

1880
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,400
It's okay, there's still a way!

1881
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:50,120
Kudo-kun?

1882
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,860
Shit, we won't make it at this rate!

1883
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:57,920
Little boy, don't rush!

1884
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,410
Akai-san!!

1885
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,520
How about this?

1886
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:17,190
Ran! That ball...

1887
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:19,740
Blow it up! Faster!

1888
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,240
Bigger!

1889
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:24,580
Get out of here!

1890
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:28,880
No good! I can't stop it!

1891
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:54,310
Kids!

1892
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:03,180
Stop it!

1893
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:22,270
It stopped, didn't it?

1894
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:24,400
Yes! It stopped!

1895
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:26,530
I'm sure Conan-kun stopped it!

1896
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:35,620
What a kid.

1897
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:39,050
I never thought he'd actually stop this giant Ferris wheel.

1898
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:43,750
Just who was it... in that crane truck...

1899
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:46,910
Good job, little boy.

1900
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:01,840
Wait. I need to check the body.

1901
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,080
Oh, no problem.

1902
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,710
But it is not in a condition where it can be identified.

1903
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:08,180
I understand.

1904
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,290
Thank you. Go on.

1905
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:14,170
It's...

1906
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:19,310
Boy, can you show me what you just picked up?

1907
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,520
What is this?

1908
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:24,530
Is it the storage medium?

1909
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:26,170
No.

1910
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:29,500
It's not the storage medium. It's a memory.

1911
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,550
Though its burned black now.

1912
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:56,080
Last night, at the Touto Aquarium...

1913
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,890
That was so close!

1914
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,990
What's this? You're so bad at it!

1915
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:05,520
Then why don't you try it, Genta-kun?

1916
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,380
Sure. Leave it to me!

1917
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:11,930
She said she wanted to help us.

1918
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:17,460
Otherwise, she wouldn't be carrying the doll in her last moments.

1919
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:21,390
But why did she...

1920
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,830
We played games in the hospital.

1921
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:29,630
I gave her a doll. She was so happy. Right?

1922
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:33,290
Yeah. We all have matching dolls, right?

1923
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,820
- This.
- This one.

1924
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:36,120
Wow!

1925
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,760
But she's gone.

1926
01:50:39,410 --> 01:50:40,780
Maybe her memories returned

1927
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:42,910
so she might have returned to where she came from.

1928
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:46,620
We were just about to become friends.

1929
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,570
Yeah.

1930
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:51,850
But I think it means that you already are friends.

1931
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:54,490
Because she is being missed by all of you.

1932
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:55,550
Oh, yes!

1933
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:56,710
I think so, too.

1934
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:57,730
Yeah.

1935
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:01,230
Maybe they change her color

1936
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:06,470
at the very end.
