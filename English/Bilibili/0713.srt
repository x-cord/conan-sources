1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.540
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.840
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.040
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.540
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.040
They take a family picture

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.540
with the owner of the mansion not present.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.440
But in the picture, they see the eerie image of the owner

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.840
who was not there.

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.240
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.640
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.340
A new turn for the growing mystery.

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.440
The bottomless Dracula case.

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.440
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:30.678
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Two)"

17
00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:33.178
Hey, what's this?

18
00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.678
It looks like a psychic picture?

19
00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:37.578
Why is Hakuya who wasn't here back then

20
00:02:37.578 --> 00:02:39.578
right here in the center of the picture?

21
00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:40.978
Beats me.

22
00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:43.178
I have no idea why either.

23
00:02:43.178 --> 00:02:45.778
Don't tell me that you schemed a trick or something

24
00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:47.278
when you developed it?

25
00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:49.978
Idiot! How do you think I can use tricks like this

26
00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:52.378
with an analogue film in such a short time?

27
00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:53.878
Then, are you saying that

28
00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:56.378
Hakuya turned into a vampire just like rumor has it?

29
00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:57.778
Don't be ridiculous!

30
00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:02.678
Vampires only exist in horror movies and novels!

31
00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:04.578
The fact that he vanished from the coffin

32
00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:06.378
as well as that psychic picture

33
00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:09.078
are all something that Hakuya made up!

34
00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.378
I don't think so.

35
00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:13.078
Because he's in the picture in the position

36
00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:14.978
that Kazuha and Ran had said he was.

37
00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:16.678
I think it's for sure that

38
00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:19.178
they saw the owner in that position back then.

39
00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:20.578
What?

40
00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:23.678
At any rate, I think it's best to find the owner

41
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:25.078
as soon as possible

42
00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:29.378
and have him explain what's going on.

43
00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:30.778
Yeah.

44
00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:32.078
True.

45
00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:35.178
Oh, will you please lend that picture to me?

46
00:03:35.178 --> 00:03:38.378
We'll go check with Ran and Kazuha who are in the kitchen

47
00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:41.778
whether that's really what they saw.

48
00:03:42.778 --> 00:03:45.978
But they're both not here.

49
00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:48.778
The other chefs are gone too.

50
00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:53.378
I think they're eating their meals in another room at this time.

51
00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:59.178
We maids actually eat with them too but...

52
00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:01.878
We missed eating since we were looking for the owner.

53
00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:03.578
If I remember correctly, you said

54
00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:07.478
you were brought here with the fiance of the owner, right?

55
00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:08.778
Oh, yes.

56
00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:11.178
How'd your mother pass away?

57
00:04:11.178 --> 00:04:13.978
I heard it was from an unfortunate accident.

58
00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:16.778
Back then I was sickly and hospitalized

59
00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:21.078
in the owner's hospital so I don't know the details.

60
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:23.578
You mean the owner ran a hospital?

61
00:04:23.578 --> 00:04:28.578
Yes. He was the head of the Torakura General Hospital.

62
00:04:28.578 --> 00:04:31.278
He was a very kind man

63
00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:35.978
and paid for all my hospital and surgery fees.

64
00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:40.278
Which means you're working as a maid here for the owner?

65
00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:41.378
Right!

66
00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:42.878
I'm taking care of the owner

67
00:04:42.878 --> 00:04:45.678
who my mother was supposed to get married to.

68
00:04:45.678 --> 00:04:48.178
Well, actually, six months ago,

69
00:04:48.178 --> 00:04:50.378
I was contacted by the owner saying that

70
00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:52.578
they got an opening for a maid so why don't I come.

71
00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:55.178
All I did was accept his offer, you see.

72
00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:56.578
Oh.

73
00:04:56.578 --> 00:04:59.378
That's why I'm still not used to this mansion.

74
00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:02.678
The owner told me to come this morning too

75
00:05:02.678 --> 00:05:04.778
but I didn't know which room to go to.

76
00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:06.978
So, I ended up standing him up.

77
00:05:06.978 --> 00:05:10.478
Then, I guess the owner will scold you when he's found.

78
00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:12.378
I'll be fine!

79
00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:15.578
I never got scolded after coming here.

80
00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:17.578
The others are complaining that he's really strict about

81
00:05:17.578 --> 00:05:20.178
the way the place is cleaned and stuff, though.

82
00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:23.078
I don't think so.

83
00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:25.778
Look at this floor.

84
00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:28.978
There's something powdery sprinkled all over.

85
00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:33.678
Those kids probably did it.

86
00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:35.978
I told them that I had no dough to make wrappers for pot sticks,

87
00:05:35.978 --> 00:05:37.578
then they told me that they'd make it themselves

88
00:05:37.578 --> 00:05:40.478
and were asking me where the flour was.

89
00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:43.178
I'll bet they were rushing and spilled it.

90
00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:45.378
The dough for the wrappers are covered with Saran wrap

91
00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:46.978
and left there, see?

92
00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:49.778
Pot sticks equal garlic, so...

93
00:05:49.778 --> 00:05:52.578
But, I wonder what this thick space is?

94
00:05:52.578 --> 00:05:53.578
Huh?

95
00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:58.178
See? Flour is gone for about a width of 50cm.

96
00:05:58.178 --> 00:06:00.578
Like something was dragged along.

97
00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:02.478
Now that you mentioned it.

98
00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:04.278
I told them that the bag of garlic

99
00:06:04.278 --> 00:06:08.778
that I bought some time ago may be in the storeroom.

100
00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:11.978
If they dragged that bag inside here,

101
00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:15.778
then those girls should be here.

102
00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:18.278
I found it, Ran!! It's garlic!

103
00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.678
Wow, that plenty!

104
00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:23.278
No good...

105
00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:25.678
It's got roots and shoots sprouting out of it.

106
00:06:25.678 --> 00:06:27.178
No problem!

107
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.278
It won't taste as good,

108
00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:30.978
but if we remove them, it'll be edible!

109
00:06:30.978 --> 00:06:34.078
More than that, I wonder if just garlic will do the job?

110
00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:36.178
We've got this too, so I assure you.

111
00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:38.378
A cross?

112
00:06:38.378 --> 00:06:40.178
Right! It's formidable

113
00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:43.278
because I made it using a silver knife and spoon!

114
00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.378
Don't they say these things don't work

115
00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:47.878
unless you're a firm believer of Christianity?

116
00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:51.378
Don't worry! You celebrate Christmas too, don't you, Ran?

117
00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.778
You're celebrating Christ's birthday every year,

118
00:06:54.778 --> 00:06:57.378
so of course it'll work!

119
00:06:57.378 --> 00:06:59.578
Yep.

120
00:06:59.578 --> 00:07:01.578
I guess so.

121
00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:04.078
What? Blood type AB?

122
00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:05.778
Are you saying that the blood on the coffin

123
00:07:05.778 --> 00:07:07.978
was really blood type AB?

124
00:07:07.978 --> 00:07:09.478
Yeah.

125
00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:10.878
Thanks to Mr. Mouri's help,

126
00:07:10.878 --> 00:07:13.978
we got the Gunma Prefectural Police Department to check it.

127
00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:16.878
We were told it was with no doubt blood type AB.

128
00:07:16.878 --> 00:07:19.378
But, when we asked the people here in this mansion

129
00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:21.678
the blood type of the owner...

130
00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:23.978
He's blood type A.

131
00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:28.178
When the owner was still young, and was badly wounded.

132
00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:34.278
I remember that they used the blood of all of who were blood type A.

133
00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:36.678
Then, who's blood is that supposed to be, anyway?

134
00:07:36.678 --> 00:07:38.378
I think that the only person with type AB blood

135
00:07:38.378 --> 00:07:40.178
that is involved with this mansion

136
00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:44.278
was the maid Ms. Shimizu who died six months ago.

137
00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:45.978
What?

138
00:07:45.978 --> 00:07:48.778
Why's the blood of a person who died six months ago

139
00:07:48.778 --> 00:07:51.078
on that coffin?

140
00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:55.578
Don't tell me that Hakuya had been saving her blood

141
00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:58.478
and sipping in the coffin.

142
00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.878
More than that, I think that

143
00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.978
you should check that blood a bit more carefully.

144
00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:04.478
Like for DNA.

145
00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:06.478
And? How much more time will it take for the tunnel

146
00:08:06.478 --> 00:08:07.678
to be repaired?

147
00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:11.878
Oh, they say they'd like to have it back to normal by morning.

148
00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:13.778
If anything happens to my daughter during that time,

149
00:08:13.778 --> 00:08:15.778
you're going to get it!

150
00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:18.478
Don't worry about that, rest assured!

151
00:08:18.478 --> 00:08:22.078
Those two are into making pot sticks.

152
00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:24.678
Uh, was the owner found?

153
00:08:24.678 --> 00:08:25.878
No.

154
00:08:25.878 --> 00:08:29.278
We've looked all over for him till there's nowhere else to look.

155
00:08:29.278 --> 00:08:32.178
Did Asanobu say anything about it?

156
00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.778
He says he tried calling Hakuya many times,

157
00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:38.278
but all he gets is the answer phone.

158
00:08:38.278 --> 00:08:39.878
And? Where is he now?

159
00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:42.578
I guess he's taking a puff in the smoking room.

160
00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:47.578
Maybe Hakuya left his cell phone somewhere.

161
00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:53.778
What?

162
00:08:53.778 --> 00:08:55.578
I got mail.

163
00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:57.378
It's from Hakuya.

164
00:08:57.378 --> 00:09:00.878
It says I'm going to give you my answer from now,

165
00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:02.978
so gather in the dining room.

166
00:09:02.978 --> 00:09:06.678
Which means that he sent this mail to all of us at the same time?

167
00:09:06.678 --> 00:09:08.478
Mailed at once?

168
00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:19.478
The owner hasn't shown up yet, after all.

169
00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:21.378
It looks like it's going to rain.

170
00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:26.178
Uh, aren't you worried?

171
00:09:26.178 --> 00:09:29.178
Kamiyo hasn't been found yet, has she?

172
00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:31.178
Honey's capricious,

173
00:09:31.178 --> 00:09:34.178
and goes off just like that whenever she feels like it.

174
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:36.678
You've got to have a strong grip on her.

175
00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:38.978
You're lucky to have gotten hold of someone so rich, you know.

176
00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.878
Well, if she gets sick of me,

177
00:09:40.878 --> 00:09:43.478
I'll just get back together with you my ex.

178
00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:46.878
How long's Asanobu planning to smoke?

179
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.678
Don't tell me that

180
00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:50.678
maybe he didn't receive Hakuya's mail

181
00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:52.478
because he changed his cell phone.

182
00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:56.278
What?

183
00:09:56.278 --> 00:09:59.178
I just saw a strange shadow on the window.

184
00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:01.578
A strange shadow?

185
00:10:07.978 --> 00:10:09.978
Don't tell me that Hakuya really...

186
00:10:09.978 --> 00:10:12.078
Turned into a vampire...

187
00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:14.578
That's not possible.

188
00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:16.978
I'm sure he just used a rope or something.

189
00:10:16.978 --> 00:10:20.078
To hang himself upside down. I'm telling you!

190
00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:24.578
No joke?

191
00:10:24.578 --> 00:10:26.578
He disappeared above.

192
00:10:26.578 --> 00:10:29.278
It can't be. That's not humanly possible!

193
00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.578
Hey, look at that.

194
00:10:38.178 --> 00:10:40.378
Hey, Hattori.

195
00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:41.978
What's that?

196
00:10:41.978 --> 00:10:44.478
Is... isn't it a bird?

197
00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:49.178
But isn't it too large to be a bird?

198
00:10:49.178 --> 00:10:51.978
Kudo? You're bleeding!

199
00:10:51.978 --> 00:10:54.378
Don't tell me it bit you?

200
00:10:54.378 --> 00:10:55.878
Just what're you talking about?

201
00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:58.078
I just got a bit wet in the rain.

202
00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:01.078
It's not rain.

203
00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:03.378
Blood's dripping from the roof!

204
00:11:03.378 --> 00:11:05.978
Above here! Is there are room?

205
00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:07.178
Yes.

206
00:11:07.178 --> 00:11:09.278
The smoking room's in the attic.

207
00:11:09.278 --> 00:11:11.778
What about the smoking room?

208
00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:13.878
Blood's probably dripping from there!

209
00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:14.878
No way...

210
00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:17.378
If I remember correctly, Asanobu's there.

211
00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:28.378
No good.

212
00:11:28.378 --> 00:11:32.278
His carotid artery's been cut and his already dead.

213
00:11:32.278 --> 00:11:35.878
He's holding the knife.

214
00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:37.178
Which means...

215
00:11:37.178 --> 00:11:42.478
Somebody tried to attack him so he killed himself.

216
00:11:42.478 --> 00:11:43.878
Or...

217
00:11:43.878 --> 00:11:48.378
That somebody wanted to make it look that way.

218
00:11:48.378 --> 00:11:50.078
It's one or the other.

219
00:12:01.612 --> 00:12:03.512
Dear?

220
00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:07.612
God, I'd better hurry and find honey fast too, or else...

221
00:12:07.612 --> 00:12:12.912
True, maybe Kamiyo's already been taken away

222
00:12:12.912 --> 00:12:16.112
by Hakuya who's turned into a vampire

223
00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:19.312
as legend has it and is being impaled.

224
00:12:19.312 --> 00:12:21.212
Hey.

225
00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:22.812
Excuse me.

226
00:12:22.812 --> 00:12:24.712
Won't you please tell us about it?

227
00:12:24.712 --> 00:12:27.612
About that legend!

228
00:12:27.612 --> 00:12:32.012
It was around the Edo Era.

229
00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:36.012
When the, feudal lord, ancestor of the Torakura family

230
00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:38.212
used to rule this area.

231
00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:41.712
Rumor started going around that blessed with no children,

232
00:12:41.712 --> 00:12:45.112
he would have to give his inheritance over to his younger brother.

233
00:12:45.112 --> 00:12:46.812
Then suddenly, he invited

234
00:12:46.812 --> 00:12:50.412
a beautiful woman as his mistress to the castle.

235
00:12:50.412 --> 00:12:53.112
After a while, she happily ended up

236
00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:56.312
giving birth to an heir, however...

237
00:12:56.312 --> 00:12:58.812
One stormy night, an incident occurred.

238
00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:00.112
An incident?

239
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.812
That woman seems to have fallen off the cliff,

240
00:13:02.812 --> 00:13:05.612
and was found dead with a branch

241
00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:08.012
pierced through her chest.

242
00:13:08.012 --> 00:13:10.412
The lord who was suspicious,

243
00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:13.012
tortured the people who were close to the mistress

244
00:13:13.012 --> 00:13:17.012
with torture devices he asked to be sent from the Western world.

245
00:13:17.012 --> 00:13:20.112
Then, the truth came to light.

246
00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:22.312
The mistress seems to have been told by her brother-in-law

247
00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:25.312
that the young inheritor had gone to the forest and not returned,

248
00:13:25.312 --> 00:13:29.012
in order to lure her into the forest.

249
00:13:29.012 --> 00:13:32.812
The lord who was angered is said to have impaled

250
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.012
his younger brother as well as all those who helped him

251
00:13:35.012 --> 00:13:37.312
in the same way as his mistress was found.

252
00:13:37.312 --> 00:13:41.012
And lined them up in the forest.

253
00:13:41.012 --> 00:13:46.312
Since then, this lord became better known as "Lord Impaler".

254
00:13:46.312 --> 00:13:52.112
Oh. But it's not like he was a vampire or anything, right?

255
00:13:52.112 --> 00:13:53.912
Don't you know?

256
00:13:53.912 --> 00:13:56.412
About Vlad III of Wallachia, who Dracula was modeled

257
00:13:56.412 --> 00:14:01.912
after that impaled traitors and rebels one after the other

258
00:14:01.912 --> 00:14:04.012
was called "Lord Impaler."

259
00:14:04.012 --> 00:14:06.012
Oh, really?

260
00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.212
Yeah. The father of Vlad III was Lord Dragon.

261
00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:11.312
Therefore, he was called Dracul.

262
00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:13.312
It seems that he called himself Dracula

263
00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.412
because he was that Lord's son.

264
00:14:15.412 --> 00:14:16.712
While we're at it,

265
00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:20.112
would you like to take a look at the European room?

266
00:14:20.112 --> 00:14:22.212
European room?

267
00:14:24.812 --> 00:14:26.512
I see.

268
00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:29.712
So, the torture devices that the Lord had bought

269
00:14:29.712 --> 00:14:32.612
and sent over from Europe are stored here, eh?

270
00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:35.312
A guillotine's here too.

271
00:14:35.312 --> 00:14:37.612
I see! It was this room!

272
00:14:37.612 --> 00:14:38.612
Huh?

273
00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:41.512
See, the owner called me this morning.

274
00:14:41.512 --> 00:14:44.912
But I didn't know where this European room was.

275
00:14:44.912 --> 00:14:47.312
You could've just asked somebody, right?

276
00:14:47.312 --> 00:14:50.612
But, he told me to come to the European room

277
00:14:50.612 --> 00:14:52.212
without telling anyone.

278
00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:57.812
He cautioned me not to tell the butler in particular.

279
00:14:59.112 --> 00:15:01.912
I guess when you were searching for the owner,

280
00:15:01.912 --> 00:15:03.812
you looked in this room too?

281
00:15:03.812 --> 00:15:04.912
Oh.

282
00:15:04.912 --> 00:15:08.312
I passed, because it gives me the creeps.

283
00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:14.612
Lord Impaler, this torture room and that flying monster.

284
00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:17.812
I could never tell Ran and Kazuha about it.

285
00:15:17.812 --> 00:15:20.812
Done! The pot sticks are ready.

286
00:15:20.812 --> 00:15:23.112
We've made a lot!

287
00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:25.212
All we need to do now is cook them.

288
00:15:25.212 --> 00:15:27.412
We've got to let Conan and Heiji taste them too.

289
00:15:27.412 --> 00:15:28.712
Right!

290
00:15:32.212 --> 00:15:34.212
Oh, well...

291
00:15:34.212 --> 00:15:39.312
I just came to tell you to be careful when you use the stove.

292
00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:42.112
-Oh. Yes, sir. -Okay!

293
00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:43.712
Okay, I'll leave it to you girls, then.

294
00:15:44.412 --> 00:15:46.312
Don't you have to tell them?

295
00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.612
That there's been a murder.

296
00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:51.612
Ignorance is bliss for the two girls.

297
00:15:51.612 --> 00:15:52.812
True.

298
00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:57.112
Listen, everybody!

299
00:15:57.112 --> 00:15:59.012
All of you four make sure that

300
00:15:59.012 --> 00:16:02.312
you don't leave this dining room until I return!

301
00:16:02.312 --> 00:16:04.612
But, I've got to look for honey.

302
00:16:04.612 --> 00:16:08.112
The butler and I will go look for her.

303
00:16:08.112 --> 00:16:11.012
Call me if something comes up, okay, Hikaru?

304
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.512
Yep.

305
00:16:14.512 --> 00:16:17.312
I hope you told all the other maids and chefs

306
00:16:17.312 --> 00:16:19.412
to stay in their rooms?

307
00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:23.412
Yes. But, you dealing with a vampire.

308
00:16:23.412 --> 00:16:27.112
Is it really okay just us, doing this on our own?

309
00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:31.412
Idiot. There're no such things as vampires in this world!

310
00:16:31.412 --> 00:16:34.612
We're going to search for evidence to prove so from now!

311
00:16:36.312 --> 00:16:39.012
First of all, let's check this coffin.

312
00:16:39.012 --> 00:16:42.312
I'll bet it's rigged in some way.

313
00:16:42.312 --> 00:16:44.212
Besides, this room.

314
00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:47.812
It somehow seems different from when we first came, no?

315
00:16:47.812 --> 00:16:53.012
But, the carpet, desk and the sofa are all in place.

316
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.212
Right.

317
00:16:54.212 --> 00:16:58.012
Talking of coffins during the incident that happened six months ago,

318
00:16:58.012 --> 00:17:01.512
it seems the master asked the chef to wake him up.

319
00:17:01.512 --> 00:17:04.012
It's only right to ask a maid or butler

320
00:17:04.012 --> 00:17:05.912
to do something like that, isn't it?

321
00:17:05.912 --> 00:17:09.912
In my case, I think it's because I wasn't trusted.

322
00:17:09.912 --> 00:17:13.612
Because each time I tried to stop the owner from his weird actions,

323
00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:16.512
he used to give me an unpleasant, suspicious look.

324
00:17:16.512 --> 00:17:18.812
Hey! Look at this!

325
00:17:18.812 --> 00:17:21.512
There are two slits in the carpet.

326
00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:26.312
Which means if I pull here

327
00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.912
and remove just this width

328
00:17:27.912 --> 00:17:30.512
and join the remaining parts together...

329
00:17:30.512 --> 00:17:32.712
The carpet will get small!

330
00:17:32.712 --> 00:17:34.212
What?

331
00:17:34.212 --> 00:17:35.612
In other words!

332
00:17:35.612 --> 00:17:38.012
The position that the coffin was in when we first saw it

333
00:17:38.012 --> 00:17:40.312
was more towards the center of the room.

334
00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:41.612
Huh?

335
00:17:41.612 --> 00:17:43.312
A handle on the tile.

336
00:17:45.512 --> 00:17:50.612
I see. So, this is how it was rigged.

337
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:52.512
And, next.

338
00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:55.012
For that psychic picture.

339
00:17:55.012 --> 00:17:58.112
I more or less have an idea.

340
00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:01.112
Just as I thought.

341
00:18:01.112 --> 00:18:05.012
Hey. Did you always take pictures facing your back to the wall?

342
00:18:05.012 --> 00:18:08.212
Yes. The chairs were also placed in that position.

343
00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:13.612
Only this time it seems that the two girls pushed the shutter.

344
00:18:13.612 --> 00:18:19.512
But the fact is that the owner had asked the maid Hikaru to do it.

345
00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:21.712
-Huh? -Why?

346
00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:22.712
I wonder.

347
00:18:22.712 --> 00:18:25.812
Ms. Shimizu, who passed away six months ago,

348
00:18:25.812 --> 00:18:27.412
used to do it before.

349
00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:30.012
I thought he just figured that

350
00:18:30.012 --> 00:18:34.412
it was her duty to take after that role.

351
00:18:34.412 --> 00:18:38.812
Well, that maid seems to have been favored by the owner.

352
00:18:38.812 --> 00:18:39.812
Huh?

353
00:18:39.812 --> 00:18:41.712
Hikaru told us!

354
00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:43.712
That the owner was very kind to her

355
00:18:43.712 --> 00:18:45.612
and that she never was scolded.

356
00:18:45.612 --> 00:18:47.912
What a thing to say!

357
00:18:47.912 --> 00:18:53.412
All he used to do recently was talk ill of her.

358
00:18:53.412 --> 00:18:57.512
But, she was invited to come to this mansion by him, wasn't she?

359
00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:58.912
No way!

360
00:18:58.912 --> 00:19:00.712
The owner told me that she used her status

361
00:19:00.712 --> 00:19:02.312
as the daughter of his former fiance

362
00:19:02.312 --> 00:19:05.912
and begged in tears for him to hire her.

363
00:19:05.912 --> 00:19:10.012
Well, since she's a quite cheerful girl,

364
00:19:10.012 --> 00:19:14.012
the maids and chefs seem to take well to her.

365
00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:19.012
Maybe she came to this mansion pursuing something, after all.

366
00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:20.412
Pursuing something?

367
00:19:20.412 --> 00:19:25.212
Have you heard about her mother Yoko from her?

368
00:19:25.212 --> 00:19:28.512
Yeah, that she died of an unfortunate accident.

369
00:19:28.512 --> 00:19:31.212
She died on a stormy night.

370
00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.012
Yoko suddenly said that

371
00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:37.112
she was going to go to the owner's hospital by car.

372
00:19:37.112 --> 00:19:39.712
I stopped her saying that it was dangerous but...

373
00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:42.312
just as I had worried, she fell over the cliff car and all

374
00:19:42.312 --> 00:19:45.312
while driving along the mountain road.

375
00:19:45.312 --> 00:19:49.512
The police said that it was a driving accident but...

376
00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:51.912
But, why did she go out on a day like that?

377
00:19:51.912 --> 00:19:55.912
Just before she left, I got a call from the owner

378
00:19:55.912 --> 00:20:01.612
to relay to Yoko that her daughter's surgery went well.

379
00:20:01.612 --> 00:20:05.312
That's why the maid, Ms. Shimizu was saying that

380
00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:10.212
she probably wanted to see her as soon as she possibly could.

381
00:20:10.212 --> 00:20:15.612
Yoko back then looked pale, and didn't look to me that way at all.

382
00:20:15.612 --> 00:20:17.512
Why did Ms. Shimizu say something like that?

383
00:20:17.512 --> 00:20:21.112
Because I told her to relay the message

384
00:20:21.112 --> 00:20:23.812
that I got from the owner to Yoko.

385
00:20:24.512 --> 00:20:27.212
Was the car Yoko's?

386
00:20:27.212 --> 00:20:32.112
No. It was Asanobu's, who died a while ago.

387
00:20:32.112 --> 00:20:36.012
Everyone was here at this mansion back then.

388
00:20:36.012 --> 00:20:38.912
Everyone? Which means the others were here too?

389
00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:40.712
Yes.

390
00:20:40.712 --> 00:20:45.712
Everyone who is here today, were all here.

391
00:20:45.712 --> 00:20:48.012
So if that accident

392
00:20:48.012 --> 00:20:51.712
were to have been schemed by someone as rumor has it...

393
00:20:51.712 --> 00:20:54.312
Does Hikaru know of this?

394
00:20:54.312 --> 00:20:55.412
I wonder.

395
00:20:55.412 --> 00:20:59.512
The owner told me not to say anything.

396
00:20:59.512 --> 00:21:02.812
Because he would tell her himself.

397
00:21:02.812 --> 00:21:04.612
Huh?

398
00:21:04.612 --> 00:21:07.612
Hikaru was summoned by the owner this morning

399
00:21:07.612 --> 00:21:09.412
but said she didn't get to see him.

400
00:21:09.412 --> 00:21:12.612
If that was a lie and in fact she did get to see him...

401
00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:16.212
Where's Hikaru?

402
00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:17.612
She's gone!

403
00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:20.712
She said she was going to serve tea.

404
00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.512
And went to the kitchen.

405
00:21:22.512 --> 00:21:23.712
To the kitchen?

406
00:21:23.712 --> 00:21:26.012
By the way, aren't the police here yet?

407
00:21:26.012 --> 00:21:27.712
You did call them, right?

408
00:21:27.712 --> 00:21:32.612
Yes, but they said the tunnel would take until morning to fix.

409
00:21:32.612 --> 00:21:35.012
Did you find my honey yet?

410
00:21:35.012 --> 00:21:36.712
Not yet.

411
00:21:37.812 --> 00:21:39.812
I'm getting a bit hungry too.

412
00:21:39.812 --> 00:21:41.812
Maybe I'll go take a bite of the pot sticks

413
00:21:41.812 --> 00:21:43.912
that those two girls made.

414
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:46.112
How do you know that Ran and Kazuha

415
00:21:46.112 --> 00:21:47.512
are making the pot sticks?

416
00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:50.012
They came here a while ago.

417
00:21:50.012 --> 00:21:52.912
To borrow the key to the freezer from Hikaru.

418
00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:54.512
They said they made too many

419
00:21:54.512 --> 00:21:56.612
so that they wanted to freeze some.

420
00:21:56.612 --> 00:22:00.212
Come to think of it, after they came to borrow the key,

421
00:22:00.212 --> 00:22:03.012
Hikaru also went to the kitchen.

422
00:22:03.012 --> 00:22:05.512
Right, there's still one place left.

423
00:22:05.512 --> 00:22:08.012
That we haven't searched.

424
00:22:08.012 --> 00:22:09.512
The freezer.

425
00:22:09.512 --> 00:22:11.212
Don't tell me that inside the freezer.

426
00:22:13.212 --> 00:22:17.212
No good. This isn't the right key either.

427
00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:21.612
I wish they'd put labels showing which key is for what.

428
00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:24.012
Well, we'll get to it in time.

429
00:22:24.012 --> 00:22:25.312
True.

430
00:23:52.312 --> 00:23:54.812
We'll overcome with garlic power!

431
00:23:57.512 --> 00:24:00.512
I just got word from the gate guard.

432
00:24:00.512 --> 00:24:03.912
That someone was found dead in the forest in front of the mansion.

433
00:24:04.412 --> 00:24:05.612
What?

434
00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:08.112
You're not police detectives, are you?

435
00:24:08.112 --> 00:24:12.312
But, if you're detectives, are you training under Detective Mouri?

436
00:24:12.312 --> 00:24:16.412
Huh? Why should I train under that goofy?

437
00:24:16.712 --> 00:24:18.312
Next Conan,

438
00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:22.212
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Three)"

439
00:24:37.912 --> 00:24:40.212
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:42.212
"Stake"

441
00:24:42.212 --> 00:24:43.912
This case looks pretty bad.

442
00:24:43.912 --> 00:24:45.712
Yeah, it sucks...

443
00:24:45.712 --> 00:24:46.912
blood!
