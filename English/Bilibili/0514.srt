1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,140
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,440
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,540
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,440
Coffee cups and cake tell of the truth of the case.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
The real killer and sad truth.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:59,892
A program called "24-Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri"

10
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:01,892
is scheduled to be produced.

11
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,592
"Maiko Kusumi (29)" -Along with Mr. Shogo Somei,

12
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:08,392
"Shogo Somei (35)" -the president of the program production company,

13
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,992
"Raisaku Nakame (52)" -we headed off to the house

14
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:13,392
of Tohto TV's producer, Mr. Raisaku Nakame.

15
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:16,292
However, when we got there, the front door was locked,

16
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:18,492
and no one answered the door bell.

17
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,792
After hearing from President Somei

18
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,092
that Mr. Nakame had been contemplating suicide,

19
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:28,092
we called the condo manager and made it into the room.

20
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:31,092
Mr. Nakame!

21
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:34,292
In the room, we found the body of Mr. Nakame,

22
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,392
who had drunk poisoned coffee lying dead on the floor.

23
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,192
The spilled coffee on top the table

24
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,092
indicated traces of deception.

25
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:46,392
The possibility of it being a murder increased.

26
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:49,492
Moreover, the coffee that had spilled on the floor indicated

27
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,292
that someone was in the room

28
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,992
with Mr. Nakame at the time of his death.

29
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:56,492
The mystery of the case grew deeper.

30
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:02,492
How did that person get out of this room that had a locked front door?

31
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:06,492
And who is the one that poisoned Mr. Nakame to death?

32
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:12,392
"Intent to Kill is the Aroma of Coffee (Part 2)".

33
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:15,692
It means

34
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:19,892
that the killer may still be hiding somewhere in this room.

35
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,792
Check every nook and cranny.

36
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:22,992
Yes, sir...

37
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:25,192
Takagi, hold it.

38
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,192
Yes?

39
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:30,292
President Somei could be the one who schemed this trick

40
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:35,092
and went into the room first to hide the traces of his trick.

41
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,892
Go and check

42
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:39,792
if he's really on sick leave from his company.

43
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:40,992
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:44,792
"Somei Productions" -Huh? How is President Somei feeling?

45
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,192
Well.

46
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,392
It seems he hasn't been feeling too well the past two or three days.

47
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,892
He wasn't at work today either.

48
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,592
Is that right?

49
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:54,392
Did he mention

50
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:57,192
which part of his body isn't feeling well?

51
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,992
No, it's not anything like that.

52
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:01,092
I think it has something to do with work.

53
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,792
Work-related?

54
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:05,792
I think it's because the special he was planning on went down the drain.

55
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,892
What? A special program?

56
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,192
Do you mean the one that Detective Mouri was going to be featured?

57
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,792
Oh, so you know about it.

58
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:17,492
Yes, it's that "24 Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri" program.

59
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:21,092
What about the meeting that was supposed to take place with Mr. Nakame?

60
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,492
It was cancelled as well.

61
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:25,892
The president said he'd personally apologize to Mr. Mouri,

62
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,992
but I wonder if he really did.

63
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:31,292
Well, that isn't what's important now.

64
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,592
Oh, yes. That's right.

65
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:33,892
Speaking of the president,

66
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:37,492
I saw him today around sundown at a pharmacy nearby.

67
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,892
What time was that?

68
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:41,592
I think it was around 6.30 pm.

69
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,392
6.30 pm?

70
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,292
6.30 pm...

71
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,292
If that's true, it's a perfect alibi

72
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:52,292
because the company is quite some distance from here.

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,292
I wonder why he didn't even mention it.

74
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:02,192
Yes, Mr. Somei came at around 6.30 pm

75
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,192
to buy stomach medicine.

76
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:07,592
But why would the police want to know something like that?

77
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:08,592
Well, you see.

78
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:12,592
Mr. Somei inadvertently got himself into a certain incident.

79
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:16,492
Do you mean the one that has to do with that famed Detective Kogoro Mouri?

80
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,492
While he was here, he answered a call,

81
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,992
and I heard Mr. Somei saying, "Detective Mouri".

82
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,292
Well...

83
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:29,292
Wait. He got another call before that one.

84
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,692
Do you know who it was from?

85
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,392
I'm sure that it was a woman.

86
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:35,692
A woman?

87
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:37,992
He called her Maiko.

88
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:40,592
-Maiko? -Maiko?

89
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:43,592
It's the woman who came to the detective office

90
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,092
with Mr. Somei the other day.

91
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,592
She called Mr. Somei at that time.

92
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:57,792
This is...

93
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,192
Could it be...

94
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:07,892
The reason why President Somei rushed into this room first was because...

95
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,092
His real intention was...

96
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,792
The aroma of coffee.

97
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,392
Just as I thought.

98
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,592
No one's here after all.

99
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,592
Was that window locked?

100
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,592
Yeah. Just to be sure,

101
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,692
we checked the veranda after opening the window.

102
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:32,492
Don't you open the window

103
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,292
because it's raining pretty heavily.

104
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:41,092
The window was closed,

105
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:44,892
but the lace curtain is wet.

106
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:46,092
Come to think of it,

107
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:48,592
when President Somei came to this condo,

108
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,892
his jacket was wet.

109
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:53,592
So, how was the veranda?

110
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:56,292
Could someone have gone to the room next door

111
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,292
or gone down from there?

112
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,692
No, no way.

113
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,892
The veranda's blocked off by a wall from the room next door,

114
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,192
and there is no trace that the emergency escape ladder

115
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,492
was used to get down to the veranda below.

116
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,792
Besides, we're on the 20th floor.

117
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,892
It may be a parking lot right below here,

118
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,992
but if someone were to use a rope and try to make it down,

119
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:18,792
I'm sure that someone is bound to notice.

120
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:22,992
Well, I guess you could use a hand glider to fly like Thief Kid,

121
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,992
but it would be quite difficult in the rain.

122
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:29,992
If so, there's only one answer.

123
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:33,992
The one and only sad truth.

124
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,292
May I be excused to leave?

125
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,692
It's getting pretty late

126
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,392
and I'm starting to feel unwell again.

127
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:51,392
No. Please wait a while longer.

128
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:54,492
Hey, did you confirm whether he really is unwell or not?

129
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:58,192
Yes, I called President Somei's company

130
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,892
and found out that he's having stomach trouble.

131
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:03,392
He also took leave for two to three days.

132
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:06,492
I was also told that an employee saw him

133
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:10,192
at a neighborhood drugstore today at sundown around 6.30.

134
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,992
About 6.30 pm?

135
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,192
That's the estimated time of death of the body.

136
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,292
Yes. I also called the drugstore,

137
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:21,292
and confirmed he was buying stomach medicine there at the time.

138
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,592
Which means he has an alibi?

139
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:28,492
Yes. And that program "24 Hour Close Up of Kogoro Mouri"

140
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:30,392
has already been cancelled.

141
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:31,992
So, I can't figure out

142
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,692
why he took Mr. Mouri over to Mr. Nakame's residence

143
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:37,792
to have the meeting as scheduled without saying a word about it.

144
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,992
I guess he did come to hide

145
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:44,092
traces of a locked room murder trick.

146
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:47,992
If so, we've got to figure out the trick first.

147
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:51,092
In cases like these,

148
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:54,692
if things go as they usually do, Mouri would come up with something.

149
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,092
He would make strange sounds like "Hinyo" or the like.

150
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:57,692
That's right.

151
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,592
Well, comments that Conan makes out of the blue

152
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:03,392
lead to hints on solving the case at times too.

153
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,792
Why?

154
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,292
Why not?

155
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,992
I said no, so it's a no.

156
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,692
Stop saying strange things, will you?

157
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,392
What is it he should stop saying?

158
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,992
Is it something important to do with the case?

159
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:17,992
No. He said that he's hungry

160
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:22,392
and wants to eat that cake that's on the table.

161
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:25,892
Because nobody's eating that cake, right?

162
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,792
Then, why can't I eat it?

163
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,692
Well, you see, Conan.

164
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,992
The cake is an important evidence,

165
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,892
and we've still got a lot of examining to do.

166
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,192
No way.

167
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,992
I'll bet you're planning to eat it later with Inspector Megure.

168
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,292
No, no. We won't do such a thing.

169
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:44,792
Anyway, there's just enough for two.

170
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,592
-What? Just enough for two? -What? Just enough for two?

171
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,092
See, take a good look at that cake.

172
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,992
It's sliced in the middle.

173
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,692
-It's true! -But why?

174
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,792
-This means... -Maybe...

175
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,892
someone suddenly felt like eating more cake?

176
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,692
The rest of the whole cake was in the refrigerator,

177
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,992
so it could be cut into any size they like.

178
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:11,892
Oh, boy. When did Pops check out the refrigerator?

179
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,992
Ran does that a lot too.

180
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,392
She buys extra cake saying that it's for our guests,

181
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,692
and ends up eating two servings by herself.

182
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,892
That's why she's grown in all the wrong places.

183
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:24,592
What does that have to do with this case?

184
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:26,592
Speaking of growth,

185
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,992
if you give coffee to a tree, will it help the tree grow?

186
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,592
Giving coffee to a tree?

187
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:33,892
What nonsense are you talking about?

188
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:37,992
But I smell coffee from that plant over there.

189
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,192
Let me see.

190
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:43,892
He's right.

191
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:47,192
Maybe it does help the tree grow.

192
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:52,592
This pencil holder smells of coffee too.

193
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:57,492
That man called Mr. Nakame must've really liked coffee.

194
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:05,392
I get it!

195
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:09,692
Maybe the placement of the coffee cup and the cake on the table

196
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:11,692
wasn't like this initially.

197
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,292
But rather...

198
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,092
What do you think about this?

199
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:38,692
It increased to a serving for two people.

200
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:41,092
I see.

201
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:43,692
You move the cake to one plate,

202
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:46,692
then place the plate that is emptied under the coffee cup,

203
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,792
making it look like a saucer.

204
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,192
You pour your own coffee into the planter,

205
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,892
then put writing tools into the other coffee cup

206
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,592
to make it look like a pencil holder, completing the deception trick.

207
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,792
This was done to make it look as if no one was here with Mr. Nakame

208
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,892
when he drank the poisoned coffee.

209
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:06,292
But who would do something like this?

210
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,992
The killer.

211
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:12,292
It was to make it look as if Mr. Nakame had committed suicide.

212
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,192
So who is that killer?

213
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,692
Well...

214
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,592
That's...

215
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,803
Something's strange.

216
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:37,403
Why are you making that sound again?

217
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,303
Come on, it's the third time today.

218
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:43,903
But there are some things missing on the table.

219
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,303
What?

220
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:48,903
There are two pieces of cake, two plates and two coffee cups.

221
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:50,303
Nothing's missing.

222
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,203
It's the fork.

223
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:55,703
One fork that is needed to eat the cake is missing.

224
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,103
You're right.

225
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,403
The fork for the plate that was used as a saucer isn't here.

226
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:02,903
That means it's somewhere in this room.

227
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,203
Like in the kitchen?

228
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:08,003
No. If the killer had time to hide it into the the kitchen cabinet,

229
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:11,903
the coffee cups would've been brought to the sink too.

230
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:15,903
I didn't have time, so I hid it in my pocket.

231
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,603
If I didn't shout as soon as I saw Mr. Nakame's dead body,

232
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:23,403
I would be suspected, right?

233
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,103
Does that mean you killed Mr. Nakame?

234
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,303
Yes.

235
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:31,503
After all, he did give me a pretty bad time, work-wise.

236
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:34,903
I killed him just as you had mentioned, inspector.

237
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,003
I came here with the cake,

238
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:39,303
put poison into coffee,

239
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:41,903
then told him I had urgent business to attend to and left.

240
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,603
I warned him to chain lock the door for safety reasons

241
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:46,303
before leaving.

242
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:49,403
Back then, I was bothered about my portion of cake and coffee cup

243
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,803
that I left on the table.

244
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:56,003
So I told Mr. Nakame I'd put them away before leaving.

245
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,503
But he told me to hurry and go if it was urgent.

246
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,203
That he would clean up the place.

247
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:05,403
So I came back to this room with Mr. Mouri

248
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,703
to hide the coffee cup and cake.

249
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:10,503
I guess it was useless after all.

250
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,703
But there are eye-witness reports of you being at a drugstore

251
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:17,303
in your neighborhood at around 6.30 pm.

252
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:18,403
Who saw me?

253
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:22,103
An employee of your company and the sales clerk at the drugstore.

254
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:26,603
It's true that I went to buy medicine today,

255
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,203
but that was a little after 5.00 pm.

256
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:30,503
I'm sure they got the time wrong.

257
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,903
Then, what about the coffee stain?

258
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:37,303
Judging from the way the coffee spilled on the floor and stained it,

259
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:43,003
it happened when someone was sitting on the chair.

260
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:47,203
Well, I spilled the coffee deliberately.

261
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,403
Deliberately?

262
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,703
When I came into this room with Mr. Mouri,

263
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:55,603
I spilled the coffee deliberately before pouring it into the planter.

264
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,003
Doing so would make this look like an impossible crime, wouldn't it?

265
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:04,003
But when I touched the stain right after Conan told me to do so,

266
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,803
it wasn't wet at all.

267
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:08,003
Do you remember when you touched it?

268
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:10,003
No, I don't remember the time.

269
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,703
But I'm sure it was 30 to 40 minutes after we received the call.

270
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,203
You're not really sure, are you?

271
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:18,903
It probably dried up because some time had passed.

272
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:21,803
Besides, if I wasn't the one who stained the floor,

273
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,903
who else could've done it?

274
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,003
How did that person lock the door up

275
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,003
and where did that person disappear to?

276
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,403
Yes. The person disappeared

277
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,303
to the world beyond.

278
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,103
What do you mean by the world beyond?

279
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,503
Oh, well. That's what I'd like to know...

280
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:48,803
Dad, don't tell me that...

281
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:50,403
It's finally coming.

282
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:54,403
Yes. The mystery that everyone wants to hear.

283
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:57,603
How did the murderer make it out of this room

284
00:15:57,603 --> 00:15:59,503
and where did the killer disappear to?

285
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,903
The answer is the world beyond.

286
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:07,103
The person fled to the underworld that is totally out of our reach.

287
00:16:07,103 --> 00:16:10,203
Hey, I don't understand a word you're saying.

288
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,403
Don't... don't tell me

289
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,903
that Mr. Nakame schemed it himself before committing suicide.

290
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,403
-What? -No.

291
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,003
It's not Mr. Nakame's own doing.

292
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,203
Think about it.

293
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,903
The window of this room was closed.

294
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:25,703
Why did the curtain still get wet?

295
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:28,603
And when we arrived at this condo,

296
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,703
why was President Somei's clothes wet

297
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:34,103
despite having been in the car all the while?

298
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,703
At around 6.30, the estimated time the murder was committed,

299
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:41,303
there was another person who called President Somei

300
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:44,003
besides me.

301
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:49,203
And that killer is a person that President Somei wants to protect

302
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:54,103
even if he himself were to be taken as the murderer.

303
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:56,903
Wait, don't tell me that it's...

304
00:16:56,903 --> 00:17:01,403
Yes. The one who killed Mr. Nakame

305
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:05,003
was an employee at President Somei's company,

306
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,903
Ms. Maiko Kusumi.

307
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:21,103
She probably came here with the cake

308
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:24,103
and made Mr. Nakame drink poisoned coffee.

309
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:27,803
She made sure he was dead,

310
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:31,703
then jumped out from the veranda and took her own life.

311
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:33,403
It can't be...

312
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,203
So, the call that Mr. Somei received on his phone

313
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:38,503
at the time of the crime was from her.

314
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:42,903
She probably called to tell him that she was going to commit suicide.

315
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:45,003
She told President Somei,

316
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:48,703
the person she cherished and trusted most about it.

317
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,403
That... That's not true!

318
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,203
She didn't do anything!

319
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,003
I schemed all of this on my own!

320
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:55,803
-She did nothing! -You came here

321
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:58,803
so that she wouldn't be seen as a killer, right?

322
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:01,603
You tried to make it look as if she was never here

323
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:04,303
and that Mr. Nakame committed suicide, right?

324
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:05,603
In case the worst happened,

325
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:08,103
you would set yourself up as the killer in her place.

326
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:11,903
So the curtain was wet

327
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:15,803
because she left the window open after going out to the veranda.

328
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,003
Yes, and President Somei's the one who closed it.

329
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,903
He also shouted

330
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:25,203
to let me know that he found the corpse.

331
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:27,803
Wrong, wrong! She didn't do it!

332
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:30,203
I did it. I'm the one who did it!

333
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:32,903
Inspector, please arrest me!

334
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,903
Don't you mind leaving her the way she is?

335
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:41,303
If you're arrested as is,

336
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:46,303
she's going to be left confined in this cold rain.

337
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:49,303
The wet body of Maiko

338
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,903
who jumped to her death

339
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,603
from the 20th floor to the parking lot,

340
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:57,103
that you carried into the trunk of your car.

341
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,003
Maiko...

342
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,003
Check the trunk of the car right now.

343
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:17,203
Yes, sir.

344
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:40,303
Later, Maiko's body was found

345
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:42,903
inside President Somei's car trunk,

346
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:47,303
and the mystery of this locked room murder case was solved.

347
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:51,403
According to the last phone call that Maiko had made to President Somei,

348
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:55,103
after Producer Nakame's request for a commission was rejected,

349
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:57,103
the TV show was cancelled.

350
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:00,103
He threatened that Somei wouldn't be able to work in industry anymore.

351
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:01,203
Maiko couldn't bear watching Somei

352
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,003
who was looking more and more haggard because of the threat,

353
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,603
thus committed the murder.

354
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:09,003
Hiding her intention to kill within her,

355
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:10,003
she didn't tell President Somei

356
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:15,203
that she had resigned from the company a day before committing the murder.

357
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,503
However, just before taking the death plunge,

358
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:22,003
she finally got to tell him how she really felt about him

359
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:25,903
using her thin voice

360
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:28,003
which was overshadowed by the sound of the rain.

361
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:44,503
"The Following Day"

362
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:45,903
What?

363
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:48,603
Did you eat the cake that was in the refrigerator?

364
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,503
Yeah, I ate my portion.

365
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,003
That's strange.

366
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,203
While you were out, mum said she came

367
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:59,403
and put three pieces of cake that she bought inside the refrigerator.

368
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:01,003
But there's only one piece left.

369
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:04,503
Take a good look. There are two pieces, aren't there?

370
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:07,003
You're right!

371
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:10,203
Wait, this piece seems to have been cut into two.

372
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:15,203
The cellophane around the cake isn't wrapped too nicely either.

373
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:17,203
It seems to have been rewrapped or something.

374
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:19,203
Is... Is that so?

375
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:22,803
There's whipped cream on the knife.

376
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,003
You ate the cake, didn't you?

377
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,003
You ate two pieces all by yourself.

378
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:27,803
Watch it. That's a knife.

379
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:32,503
Cake...

380
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,503
You can have my portion, Ran.

381
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:38,803
I'm not hungry.

382
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:42,703
Conan.

383
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:45,003
Okay, I'll give mine to you too, dad.

384
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:46,803
What? Really?

385
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:57,603
I don't think I'll be eating cake for a while.

386
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,603
Not until the rain stops, at least.

387
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:13,803
Thief Kid! I'm over here!

388
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,803
Unless you ride something like a hot air balloon,

389
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:20,903
it's impossible for to make it through this net.

390
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:23,203
By teleportation.

391
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:25,903
He's going to flee using teleportation.

392
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:28,103
I'll see you in 10 seconds

393
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,803
after I travel through time and space.

394
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:35,903
Next Conan Special, "Thief Kid's Teleportation Magic"

395
00:24:52,003 --> 00:24:54,503
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:56,503
"Black and white"

397
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:58,403
Next week is a special! Thief Kid faces off against me!

398
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:01,103
Ready! 1, 2, go!
