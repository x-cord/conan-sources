1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,740
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,940
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,840
The name of the stage is OK Ranch.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
A single combat unfolds between crime and deduction.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,353
It feels so good!

9
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,153
Doesn't it, doesn't it?

10
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,153
There's nothing better the nature.

11
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:11,753
But, Dad, why did you suddenly decide to come driving?

12
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,253
Well, I wonder why...

13
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,053
We passed here before, didn't we?

14
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,053
What?

15
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,953
Oh, really?

16
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:24,853
We're here now.

17
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,453
We came this way, and when to this way, so...

18
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:30,053
Let me check. Where are we headed for?

19
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,653
Well...

20
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,553
Dad, pull over to the side.

21
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,653
That's it!

22
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:49,453
Wait for me!

23
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,053
"Okusu Ranch"

24
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,253
-Okusu Ranch? -Okusu Ranch?

25
00:02:55,853 --> 00:03:01,553
"Tragedy at OK Ranch"

26
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:05,453
"Okusu Ranch"

27
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,553
Well, you were a great help.

28
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:11,753
Thanks to you I was able to make it here in time.

29
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:13,753
No problem.

30
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,053
After all, we haven't had people come visit us for a long time.

31
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,553
"Hirohito Ninomiya (28), Part-time ranch worker"

32
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:19,653
It's a ranch for horses.

33
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:25,353
So, Pops just brought us along so he could enjoy his horses.

34
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:28,953
I just thought that I'd let you have your fill of nature.

35
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,053
Go home!

36
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,753
Get out of here right this minute!

37
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:36,853
"Kanenari Mochizuki (46)" -You don't have to tell me to leave, I will,

38
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:38,553
"Real estate agent" -because I'm busy too, you know.

39
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,553
Just make sure that you don't goof on

40
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:44,053
the timing of selling this place.

41
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,753
Well...

42
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:56,753
I'm sorry about the scene just now.

43
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:00,753
"Tomoyuki Okusu (50), Ranch owner" -Welcome to OK Ranch.

44
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:03,653
I am Okusu, the owner of this ranch.

45
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:05,653
OK Ranch?

46
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,653
The name of the ranch is taken from

47
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,353
the first two letters of my last name, OK.

48
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:12,853
Nothing's been okay around here recently though.

49
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:13,953
"OK Ranch"

50
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,453
That's right.

51
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:19,753
Here, sonny, would you like some chocolate?

52
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:21,653
It's good!

53
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,353
Chocolate.

54
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:26,153
No, thank you.

55
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,653
Alright.

56
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,153
Fantastic.

57
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,253
I'm sorry I'm late.

58
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:39,353
I am your guide, Takeuchi.

59
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:40,653
Nice to meet you all.

60
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:41,953
(Sanae Takeuchi (21), Part-time ranch worker)

61
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,753
All the horses that are owned,

62
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,353
are out because it's horse racing season right now.

63
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:53,053
I wonder if you'll be able to see any horses you know.

64
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:59,253
Isn't this horse Madame Leap?

65
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:02,153
Yes. She's a stock mare.

66
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,053
I made a lot of money off her in the past.

67
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,753
How nostalgic.

68
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,753
Thank you for all the cash you brought in back then.

69
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:16,253
But, you don't look too well.

70
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:19,353
She experienced still birth,

71
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:23,553
and is not able to have any more babies.

72
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:27,053
I see, poor thing.

73
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:33,753
The racing stable over there is used for bringing up colts.

74
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:35,953
It's not in use right now,

75
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,053
but if you'd like to see it...

76
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,453
Hi, Sanae, guests?

77
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:53,053
Yes.

78
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,353
Hi, there! Good work,

79
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,553
take care of Madame Leap for me today, will you?

80
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:05,753
Sir, this is the guy that I've taken care of

81
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:07,253
ever since he used to be a jockey,

82
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:08,853
"Motoo Sugiyama (37), Farrier" -Motoo Sugiyama.

83
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:12,253
He is currently one of the most sought after farriers of the times.

84
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,253
A farrier?

85
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:17,953
A blacksmith, a professional at making horseshoes.

86
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:24,053
Horses that live along with human beings go through rigorous exercise.

87
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:27,353
Therefore, their hooves get scraped.

88
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,053
That's why they need horseshoes to protect the hooves.

89
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:36,353
Therefore, they periodically take off the horseshoe...

90
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:40,553
and shave off the outgrown hoof.

91
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,553
Then, in order to match the hoof that has been shaved,

92
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,753
a new horseshoe is put in place of the old one.

93
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,653
You sure are knowledgeable, sir.

94
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,853
Ms. Takeuchi is not going to have anything to do.

95
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,853
Oh no, it's just that I've heard a little about it before.

96
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:56,553
The new horseshoe is heated in flames,

97
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:59,753
then shaped to match the hoof of the horse.

98
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:08,553
The hooves of horses are all shaped differently.

99
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,153
That goes all four hooves of one horse too.

100
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,353
Is that so...

101
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,853
Are you all right, Conan?

102
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:25,053
Well, I'll be you're glad that we came, aren't you?

103
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,053
Yes.

104
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,253
Madame Leap.

105
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:41,853
Mr. Ninomiya, Madame Leap is...

106
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:45,553
What's wrong?

107
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,253
Madame Leap has run loose.

108
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:53,253
"Okusu Ranch"

109
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:56,153
Steady...

110
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:57,153
Calm down.

111
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:59,353
Steady...

112
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,853
-It's the first time that something like this ever happened. -Steady...

113
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,353
Good girl.

114
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:04,653
Calm down.

115
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:05,953
Steady...

116
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,553
Blood?

117
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:11,053
Don't tell me that...

118
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:13,353
Conan!

119
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,253
Mr. Sugiyama?

120
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:22,353
Sugiyama!

121
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:27,253
No good, he's already dead!

122
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,853
He's bleeding from his head, which means...

123
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,953
he may have been kicked by Madame Leap.

124
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,753
Oh no.

125
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:37,653
That can't be.

126
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:40,053
At any rate, please call the police.

127
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,853
That's right.

128
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:46,853
Please tie Madame Leap to the wash place or something.

129
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,253
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:54,053
What's this?

131
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,753
A piece of chocolate?

132
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,953
Its right hind leg seems to be wounded...

133
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,753
Unreal.

134
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:12,253
The nail isn't hammered in right.

135
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:18,653
The shape of the horseshoe doesn't match.

136
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:23,053
Why would Mr. Sugiyama do something terrible like this?

137
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,653
But, wait a second.

138
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:25,753
Maybe...

139
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,253
Conan!

140
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,153
It's dangerous.

141
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,453
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:34,953
Okay, okay. Calm down.

143
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:37,853
Maybe giving her something to drink will help.

144
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:40,653
Hey, Ran there was tea left in the thermos bottle, wasn't there?

145
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:43,253
No, not tea.

146
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:45,453
Although tea does not affect humans much,

147
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,753
it is a very strong stimulant for horses.

148
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,853
Tea is a stimulant?

149
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:55,153
Maybe this is not an accident.

150
00:09:57,353 --> 00:10:01,253
There's no doubt about it.

151
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,353
He was kicked by the horse. See.

152
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,753
The traces of him have being kicked,

153
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:08,353
the mark of the horseshoe is left right here.

154
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:12,553
But, just to be safe, I think it would be better to double check

155
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:15,053
whether the horseshoe matches that of the horse.

156
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:25,353
Excuse me, but may I have your name please?

157
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:30,053
Pardon me, I'm a detective, so I...

158
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:34,153
I am Kogoro Mouri.

159
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,853
You mean that famous?

160
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,853
Please excuse me for my rudeness.

161
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:42,053
But, since this is an accident,

162
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:44,653
I guess your deductions won't be necessary.

163
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,553
I guess so.

164
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:49,753
By the way, what is going to become of Madame Leap?

165
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:53,953
Well...

166
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,353
If it is a violent horse maybe it would be better to get rid of it.

167
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,153
Oh no!

168
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:03,153
Mr. Sugiyama's to blame! He deserved to die!

169
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,053
Sanae.

170
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:08,153
You mean, you don't like Mr. Sugiyama?

171
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:13,253
What do you mean by he deserved to die?

172
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:18,553
Mr. Mouri, let me explain.

173
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,553
It was when I went out to town to buy some things last night.

174
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,953
That car...

175
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,653
Isn't that Mr. Sugiyama's car?

176
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:32,953
Hey, he's...

177
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:38,753
Sugiyama was meeting Mochizuki who was trying to buy up this ranch.

178
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:43,153
Okusu is still wrapped up in making colts.

179
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:47,053
That's nice to know,

180
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:49,153
and I hope he fails again.

181
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:51,553
If he does, this time for sure he'll go bankrupt.

182
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:53,853
Which means you're going to do that again?

183
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:56,353
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Sugiyama.

184
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:01,153
Sugiyama was betraying Mr. Okusu,

185
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,853
the one who saved him, for money.

186
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:08,353
Sugiyama came along,

187
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,953
before we had a chance to tell Mr. Okusu about it.

188
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:30,061
In other words, Mr. Sugiyama, through orders of Mr. Mochizuki

189
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,261
was obstructing the horse from becoming pregnant

190
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:36,761
so that the ranch would fall into a financial rut.

191
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:41,461
Right. Producing horses cost an enormous amount of money.

192
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,561
If a horse is unable to have colts,

193
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,161
that itself is a great loss.

194
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:48,461
Which means that Madame Leap got messed up

195
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:52,761
in the ugly dispute between humans.

196
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:55,061
How terrible.

197
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:59,461
But, I wonder if that would make the horse take revenge?

198
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,861
Because if it did, it would be the same as the humans

199
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,561
who are doing those things.

200
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:08,061
That horse looks sad, but has nice eyes.

201
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,161
Hey! You stay out of this, kid!

202
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:12,261
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,061
Conan.

204
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,761
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,061
It's okay.

206
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:21,461
Your pants are wet.

207
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:26,261
I was cleaning the stalls and splashed water on myself.

208
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,661
I'm sorry, did I get you wet?

209
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,361
Nope, I'm okay.

210
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:38,261
I'm pretty sure that this case will be processed as an accident.

211
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,861
Thank you so much.

212
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,661
Officer, don't you have to take the horseshoe

213
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:44,561
that is the murder weapon with you?

214
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,261
Aren't the evidence going to be collected and taken to the police station?

215
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,161
Yeah... but...

216
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:54,061
If the horseshoe needs to be removed I'll do it now.

217
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:58,061
I used to do all the works in the past too.

218
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:00,561
Back then, I had no money to hire a specialist so...

219
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:01,761
I still don't.

220
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:04,861
I guess I'm in the same boat even now.

221
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,861
Please put it in this bag.

222
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:09,661
Okay, I've removed it.

223
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:11,561
Okay, everything's done.

224
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,961
Good girl, for sticking it out.

225
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,761
There's blood on the back of this horseshoe too.

226
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,561
He's right.

227
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,961
There's a lot of blood smeared on it.

228
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,361
That's strange.

229
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,061
Just as I thought.

230
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:29,261
I've figured everything out now.

231
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,761
The killer as well as how the crime was committed.

232
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:35,361
No matter how strong the horse is,

233
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:39,461
it's difficult for blood to find its way all the way behind the horseshoe.

234
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,861
If so, there is only one possible answer...

235
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,161
Blood was smeared onto the horseshoe beforehand?

236
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,461
Most likely, what happened then was...

237
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:51,661
But wait, that's Madame Leap's blood.

238
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,561
See, take a look.

239
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,661
The nail's been hammered in sloppily

240
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:00,461
that the veins have been damaged.

241
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:04,961
I tell you, that Sugiyama just did a really sloppy job.

242
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:07,661
It's not surprising that the horse go wild.

243
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,061
Dad.

244
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:16,561
Mr. Mouri, is anything wrong?

245
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:21,461
No, it's just that I've figured out who killed Mr. Sugiyama.

246
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,061
But, I thought this was an accident...

247
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:28,461
No, it is none other than homicide.

248
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,261
Conan, show everyone what you found.

249
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,261
Yes, sir.

250
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,461
Here it is.

251
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,661
This is what I picked up

252
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,261
at that wash place.

253
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,361
This is chocolate.

254
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:45,661
But, what about this?

255
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,661
If tea is a stimulant to horses,

256
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,461
wouldn't chocolate do the same?

257
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:57,961
Exactly, a substance called theobromine is in chocolate.

258
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:02,961
There is someone who gave chocolate to Madame Leap.

259
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,761
No way. Who could've done something so terrible?

260
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:09,861
Mr. Okusu, what did you do with the chocolate

261
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,961
that you offered Conan at the front desk a while ago?

262
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:15,161
That, well...

263
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:17,761
I left it back in my office.

264
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:18,961
If I remember correctly,

265
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:22,661
I think you put it away in your pocket back then?

266
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:31,161
Don't tell me that Mr. Okusu used chocolate to excite Madame Leap...

267
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:34,961
But, how can we tell whether Madame Leap ate the chocolate or not?

268
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,761
A simple urine test would do.

269
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:42,561
Besides, if the chocolate is checked for fingerprints

270
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,861
we can even conclude who gave it to the horse!

271
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:46,861
There is no need for that.

272
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:52,261
I gave Madame Leap the chocolate.

273
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,861
Oh, no...

274
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,961
Why? Why did you do such a thing?

275
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,861
Although I understand that you may have hated Mr. Sugiyama,

276
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,861
how could you even think of making Madame Leap kill Mr. Sugiyama?

277
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:06,761
Hold it, Sanae.

278
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,961
Madame Leap is not the one who killed Mr. Sugiyama.

279
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:16,761
The one who killed Mr. Sugiyama

280
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,761
is the one who put a horseshoe

281
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,561
that did not fit onto the right hind hoof of Madame Leap!

282
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:26,061
Which means that Mr. Sugiyama wasn't the one who put it on?

283
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,061
Of course not!

284
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,261
If a professional is to do an amateurish job like that,

285
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,361
even if it is to just get on someone's nerves,

286
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:36,261
he would lose his job on the spot.

287
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,161
And besides, the blood that was smeared on the back of the horseshoe

288
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,361
was Mr. Sugiyama's.

289
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,561
The killer probably struck the back of his head

290
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,961
with a brand new horseshoe.

291
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:53,561
Then, not knowing what to do with the blood smeared horseshoe,

292
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:58,261
the killer hurriedly put it on Madame Leap.

293
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:00,261
You would never do a sloppy job like that

294
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:04,561
no matter how much of a rush you were in, right, Mr. Okusu?

295
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:08,761
Could it have been the guy called Mochizuki,

296
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,261
who maybe got into a dispute with Sugiyama?

297
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:13,761
That is unthinkable,

298
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,661
because it would be much easier for him

299
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,461
to take the evidence along with him and walk out of here

300
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,961
before he is witnessed by anyone,

301
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:22,661
than to go out of his way to make it look like an accident.

302
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,761
Besides, if he had planned the murder beforehand,

303
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:29,261
he would have planned everything out more carefully.

304
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:32,561
Then, who did it?

305
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:34,561
Just as Sanae had pointed out,

306
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:39,161
Mr. Okusu would never do such a sloppy job.

307
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,561
But, judging from the fact that he wanted

308
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,361
to remove the horseshoe as soon as possible,

309
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:48,761
he must've know about the abnormal horseshoe at an early stage.

310
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,861
In order words, he figured out somehow from the situation at the scene,

311
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,761
who the killer was,

312
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:56,861
and in order to protect the killer,

313
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:59,661
gave Madame Leap the chocolate.

314
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,261
Then, went back to the main house

315
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:04,161
and waited for Madame Leap to go berserk.

316
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:10,261
He wanted we, the guests to hear the commotion.

317
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:13,161
A person that Mr. Okusu would want to protect enough

318
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:16,161
to even risk giving chocolate to beloved Madame Leap.

319
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:19,261
Sanae was with us all the way,

320
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,261
so she couldn't have committed the murder.

321
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,861
So, that leave us with no other choice than...

322
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:27,061
Mr. Ninomiya.

323
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,261
It was you.

324
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,761
Well?

325
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,061
No!

326
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:35,261
Your slacks seems to have been wet,

327
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,561
but, maybe if we check luminol reaction will appear?

328
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:43,861
Because you struggled to fit the blood smeared horseshoe on the horse,

329
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:51,061
despite it still not being shaped to fit the hoof of the horse yet.

330
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:57,061
Getting soiled by dirt happens every day on the ranch, but...

331
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,561
If it's the blood of the victim,

332
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:01,961
you'd have to wash it off, wouldn't you?

333
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:07,461
I didn't mean to kill him.

334
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:09,561
I really didn't mean to...

335
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:14,061
But, I just couldn't forgive him.

336
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,861
Not being able to bear it,

337
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:20,761
I pressed Sugiyama for an answer as to what we saw last night.

338
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,961
Then, he said that he would kill me

339
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,961
and simply make it look like the horse had an accident.

340
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,961
Then, he snickered.

341
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,761
While we were struggling...

342
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:39,061
Sugiyama died.

343
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:45,161
No matter if I was not myself when everything happened,

344
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,561
it is a fact that I tried to put the blame on Madame Leap.

345
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:52,761
And I'm the very one who should know more than anyone else

346
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,561
how despising it is to put the blame on a horse.

347
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:00,361
Mr. Okusu.

348
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,361
I'm sorry... I... I...

349
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,961
I'm the one who needs to apologize to you.

350
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:13,561
I sort of had an idea as to what Sugiyama was doing.

351
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,461
I kept it from you because I thought that if I let word out of it to you,

352
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:18,061
who have a strong sense of justice,

353
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:20,161
the problem would be blown out of proportion.

354
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,761
I should have told you about it somehow,

355
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,661
if things were going to turn out this way.

356
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,261
I'm so sorry, Ninomiya.

357
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,761
Mr. Ninomiya, Mr. Okusu...

358
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:41,061
Every person is responsible for compensating

359
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,761
for the crimes that he has committed.

360
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,061
No matter how much you protect the culprit

361
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,761
or try to cover up the crime that has been committed,

362
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:52,661
doing so is not a solution to the problem at all.

363
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,461
And, it doesn't matter what reasons may have existed

364
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:57,361
for committing the crime.

365
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,061
Go! Number two and number six!

366
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,461
Go for it! The black and green caps! Cheer them on!

367
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,561
Go for it! Number two! Number six!

368
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:44,261
-Go for it! -Amazing.

369
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:03,661
Now we know he's not off only when he makes deductions.

370
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:09,361
"Next Episode"

371
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,561
Price of your child, 10 billion yen.

372
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:12,661
Clown...

373
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:15,361
This is...

374
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:17,261
Mr. Tsubakuro, please lend me this picture,

375
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,861
I'll bring it right back!

376
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:21,261
Which means...

377
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,261
if I can figure out where this is,

378
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,961
I'll be able to find where Akio is being confined.

379
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:29,461
What's up, Ayumi?

380
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,761
Next Conan,

381
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Kidnapper in the Picture"

382
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,179
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,079
"Silhouette"
