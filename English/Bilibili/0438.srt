1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,940
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,740
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Today, is the usual viewing things from a different angle.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,140
Find the boy from the e-mails, that are randomly received.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:48,162
Disasters at sea due to tsunamis, forest fires

9
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:52,462
due to abnormally dry weather, and frequent earthquakes...

10
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,462
Maybe a large meteor or something's going to come falling down.

11
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,262
Really, Earth really seems to be in trouble!

12
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:01,562
Well, even I, the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

13
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:04,162
when it comes to natural disasters, my hands are tied.

14
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,862
Well, the way you usually carry yourself around,

15
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:08,262
you probably wouldn't even be able to stop a child's quarrel.

16
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:12,662
Thank you, Azusa.

17
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:15,062
Today is time off with the family day?

18
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,262
No.

19
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,262
After this, I'm going to check on the neighborhood pachinko parlor

20
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:22,162
to see how well the balls come out.

21
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:24,762
Then, in the evening, I'm going to a drinking party

22
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,362
held by the community committee.

23
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:29,062
And at night, I'm going to play mahjong.

24
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:31,162
I'm really busy, you see!

25
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,762
I see.

26
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:38,362
Oh, it's nothing, please just ignore me.

27
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:41,062
Azusa, is something wrong?

28
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:44,862
Can you tell? That something is bothering me?

29
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:47,162
I mean, you're being so obvious about it.

30
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:48,962
What's troubling you?

31
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,462
Well, you see...

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,362
It's this...

33
00:02:55,362 --> 00:03:01,362
"Pursue the Fish Mail"

34
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:02,962
Cell phone?

35
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:07,962
Don't tell me that a customer forgot something in this shop again and...

36
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:10,762
Oh, no, this is mine!

37
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:14,962
Oh then, is it a mysterious crank mail or something?

38
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:19,662
Well, it is a mail all right, but it's not crank mail.

39
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:23,962
The one sending it is a 5 years old boy, named Mitsuru Osabe.

40
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:25,362
A child...

41
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:29,462
I think it's been for these past two or three months.

42
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,562
Welcome!

43
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:38,162
He comes here often with his father.

44
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:39,762
Hello, Azusa.

45
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:43,462
It seems that his mother has gone back to her parental home

46
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:45,262
and hasn't returned yet.

47
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:49,062
So, since then, he's been mailing me a lot from his father's cell phone.

48
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,362
He writes things like, "I ate up all the cucumber."

49
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,462
"I took a bath all by myself."

50
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,862
You know, daily routine things.

51
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,662
He sends me mail about trivial things on a daily basis.

52
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:03,062
Then, why don't you tell his father

53
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:05,662
to tell the boy to stop sending you mail?

54
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,962
Oh, I'm not bothered by his mails at all.

55
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,662
It's just that he sent me four mails already today.

56
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,062
Four mails?

57
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:16,662
Yes, and the contents bothers me.

58
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:17,862
The first mail says,

59
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:22,062
"Hi, Azusa. I'm out today with daddy."

60
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,062
"He bought me a chair and cap."

61
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,962
"Everybody's wearing caps, so I guess I'll wear mine too."

62
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,162
The second mail says,

63
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:29,962
"I'm drenching with sweat and feel crummy"

64
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:32,162
"so I'm taking off my shoes."

65
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:35,562
I wonder if he's doing something that making him sweat profusely.

66
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:38,762
"I'm hungry. I'm looking at the sign of a restaurant."

67
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,962
"I want to eat hamburger that you serve at your shop."

68
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:43,562
The third mail says,

69
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,262
"A man wearing black glasses"

70
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:47,662
"and a woman in blue clothes are looking this way,"

71
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,762
"but I'm not scared."

72
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:50,662
"I'm not going to cry."

73
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,462
Crying?

74
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,762
I wonder if he's going through something frightening right now.

75
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,162
I don't know.

76
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,762
And his fourth mail says,

77
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:01,462
"Die like a fish caught in fishing net."

78
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,762
Die?

79
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:07,062
And did you send him mail, Azusa?

80
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:08,662
Yes.

81
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:11,862
Like, "Where are you?" and "What are you doing?"

82
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:15,762
But I've got no replies to my questions.

83
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:18,362
Maybe he doesn't know how to receive mail.

84
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:21,562
He can send mail, but can't receive?

85
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:28,862
Right. It seems that he was taught how to send mail to me before,

86
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,362
but as far as receiving mail, his father seems to do it for him.

87
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:34,462
I guess he wasn't taught how to open mail

88
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:37,362
in order to prevent receiving spam mails.

89
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:42,362
Which means his father is not near him?

90
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:49,162
Come to think of it, his second mail mentioned him being hungry.

91
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,462
Maybe he's been left alone for quite some time.

92
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,162
What time did that mail come?

93
00:05:53,162 --> 00:05:55,762
Yes, let's see, the first mail came...

94
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:57,562
At 9.07am.

95
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:00,162
The second one at 10.16am,

96
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:03,162
and the third one at 11.54am.

97
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:07,162
The fourth one came in just a while ago, at 3.02 in the afternoon.

98
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:10,662
The time span between the mails is getting longer each time.

99
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,462
Maybe Mitsuru's getting tired?

100
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:18,862
Really, what the heck is the father doing leaving his son alone?

101
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:21,262
I don't know about the father,

102
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:24,462
but I think Mitsuru is out fishing.

103
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,962
You idiot! I'll bet you're saying that

104
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:32,162
because the boy wrote fish caught in a net.

105
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,162
But people don't usual fish,

106
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,762
near fishermen are out fishing with their nets!

107
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:41,362
I think so too, but the first and second mail refer to fishing!

108
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:43,762
It seems that Mitsuru as well as the people around him

109
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:45,762
are all wearing hats.

110
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,762
And besides, he mentioned that his feet were drenched with sweat.

111
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,962
Children don't usually wear boots,

112
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:52,562
so he's probably wearing rubber boots.

113
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:56,562
Wearing a cap, boots and sitting on a chair is?

114
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:01,762
But, if so, the people who are there fishing...

115
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,062
That's right.

116
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:07,362
Would not leave a child who is alone for such a long time unattended.

117
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:09,062
Oh, that's probably because...

118
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,762
What is it, Conan?

119
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:11,862
What?

120
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:14,362
Everybody's absorbed in fishing and...

121
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:17,262
Well, nobody noticed him.

122
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:20,762
That's why we think it's strange.

123
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:25,762
Maybe that boy has a sore neck?

124
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:28,262
What? What're you talking about?

125
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:34,262
Because the first mail says, "everybody around him is wearing hats".

126
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:36,762
The second one says, "the sign of the restaurant".

127
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:40,562
And the third one says, "a man wearing sunglasses"

128
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,462
"and a woman in blue clothes".

129
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,962
It seems he's only looking upwards.

130
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:47,662
If you were a small child, you would understand too, Pops.

131
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:50,362
It's kind of hard, you know.

132
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:53,862
You're talking like you turned from an adult into a child.

133
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,862
I... I was just stating an example.

134
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:02,362
Hey, maybe that boy's in a car.

135
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:03,962
A car?

136
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:07,162
I mean, maybe it's not that he's looking up,

137
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,262
but rather, he cannot see what's below him.

138
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,362
Oh, inside a car...

139
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:13,562
If he is sitting in the seat and writing mail,

140
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,562
from the hip down of the people that go by

141
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,462
is hidden from his view by the door.

142
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:21,162
So maybe the third mail he sent about somebody looking towards him,

143
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:23,162
was probably one of the people who came to fish

144
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,162
that was worried about him sitting alone in the car.

145
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:27,962
It's not that easy calling out to a child inside a car.

146
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,262
I see.

147
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,162
After they arrived at the fishing spot,

148
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,962
his father for some reason disappeared.

149
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,362
Having to wait for a long time inside the car,

150
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,862
the boy got bored and decided to send mail to Azusa,

151
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:42,362
but eventually got tired.

152
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:44,962
But, what could've happened to his father?

153
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,862
I wonder if he's not coming back.

154
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,662
It's this!

155
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:54,562
But this is yesterday's...

156
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:56,562
"4 Anglers Currently Missing" -If the sea is rough,

157
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,762
the same thing could've happened!

158
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:02,562
And, did you call? Did you call that boy?

159
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,162
Yes, I tried.

160
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:06,862
But, no matter how many times I try, it won't connect!

161
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:09,362
I wonder if he's somewhere outside the service range.

162
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:12,562
Maybe he was told by his father to switch the phone off

163
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,562
after he sends mail out.

164
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,562
To save on power.

165
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,562
Hey, have you ever heard of a fishing spot

166
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:21,762
that the father and son go to a lot, Azusa?

167
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,962
No. Not really...

168
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,562
Oh, but...

169
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:29,362
One day, they were looking through a leisure magazine we have here,

170
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,862
and his father was saying, let's go here.

171
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,962
I'm sure he dog-eared it.

172
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,162
Show it to me, quickly!

173
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:37,362
Yes! I'll bring it right away.

174
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:42,462
Bad, six hours have already gone by.

175
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,562
I wonder what in the world happened.

176
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:47,962
I don't understand the fourth mail though.

177
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,562
Die like a fish caught in fishing net?

178
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:53,362
I wonder if people who are there fishing will walk around

179
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:55,462
with fish in their nets?

180
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,562
No, they'll most probably put the fish inside a cooler box.

181
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:02,662
If so, I wonder why Mitsuru would use that expression?

182
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,662
What?

183
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:06,862
There are three pages that are dog-eared?

184
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:09,562
Yes, I'm sure it's this magazine, but...

185
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:13,062
There are other customers who also dog-ear pages occasionally.

186
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:17,262
The first is Nakaarai.

187
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,462
The second is Kusarazu.

188
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:22,562
And the third is Komaezaki.

189
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,862
They're all so far from one another.

190
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:28,362
Oh, it's says "Recommended Inns" here.

191
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,962
Today is Saturday, so maybe they were planning to spend a night there.

192
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:35,662
"Nakaarai" -There is no reservation for such a person.

193
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,062
I see. By the way,

194
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:38,962
are there many people who have come fishing today?

195
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:41,362
Yes, although there is some wind,

196
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,462
it's slightly cloudy and great for fishing.

197
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,262
Wind? Maybe the tides are high

198
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:47,062
and one of your fishing guests was taken away by the waves?

199
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,862
Oh, what an unpleasant thing to say.

200
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,062
If this is a crank call, please cut it out.

201
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:58,062
"Kusarazu" -Let's see... Mr. Osabe, Mr. Osabe?

202
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,062
There's no one by that name here.

203
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,662
What? The weather?

204
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,062
It's raining, but it's easier to catch fish in this weather

205
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:07,762
so there are quite a few people here.

206
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,962
With the rain and all, has there been any accidents or such?

207
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,962
No.

208
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,662
It's drizzling off and on and there's no wind either.

209
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:20,862
"Komaezaki" -Osabe? Nope, no such guest!

210
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:24,562
Is something the matter? You sound angry.

211
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:26,362
Yeah, the guests are bugging me saying

212
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:28,162
that they can't catch even one fish!

213
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,662
In this sunny weather,

214
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,362
in a fishing spot of shallow water like ours,

215
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:33,562
it's easy to tell that the baits are on fishing poles.

216
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,362
There's no wind and the poles are easy to use.

217
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,362
If they want to fish that badly,

218
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,962
they should improve their fishing skills, right?

219
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,762
Very... very true.

220
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:44,662
How was it?

221
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:53,262
No, it... it's mail from Mitsuru!

222
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:55,462
Call him right away.

223
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:57,662
I'm sure you'll be able to connect if you do so right now.

224
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:58,662
Yes.

225
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,862
The cell phone is presently out of the service area

226
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,262
-Oh, no good. -or switched off...

227
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,562
Oh, no.

228
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,362
And, what does the mail say?

229
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,162
Yes. Let's see.

230
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,962
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three."

231
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:16,062
"How lucky the fish are."

232
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:17,562
What that supposed to mean?

233
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,062
I don't know.

234
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,362
I though there was only one fish...

235
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:26,262
I see, so there are three fish.

236
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:43,409
Mommy.

237
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,209
Mommy.

238
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,509
Why'd you leave?

239
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,309
When are you coming back?

240
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:03,509
I wonder if daddy left me and went some place too.

241
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,709
I've been waiting so long and he still hasn't come back.

242
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,009
How lucky the fish are.

243
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,509
How lucky the fish are.

244
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,509
I don't have the slightest idea.

245
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,009
The only thing we know is that this boy

246
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,209
is probably at one of the fishing spots of three.

247
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,709
Nakaarai, where there is wind, but great for fishing

248
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,409
because it is cloudy.

249
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,309
Kusarazu, where it is drizzling but has no wind

250
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:35,609
and the third, Komaezaki, where it is sunny with no wind.

251
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:38,609
Maybe it's Nakaarai because many fish are being caught, right?

252
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,909
No, but Kusarazu seems to be the same too.

253
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,909
The only place that is doing bad is Komaezaki.

254
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,509
But Mitsuru dog-eared the page

255
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,209
and decided on where to go just last week.

256
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,709
So as to the weather...

257
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:52,109
There's no connection.

258
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:54,409
Hey, about the no wind thing.

259
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,909
Is there a day when the wind doesn't blow at all?

260
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,109
What?

261
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:01,409
Well, if it's a clear day and the temperature rises...

262
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,309
Come to think of it, the guy on the phone,

263
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,509
just before hanging up said...

264
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,709
There's no wind and the fishing pole is easy to use.

265
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,909
Oh, now the wind's started to blow.

266
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,409
Hey, if Mitsuru is in the car,

267
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,509
and is looking up all the time...

268
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:22,009
Maybe he was daydreaming?

269
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,409
-What? -Because a fish can't swim above,

270
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,109
I mean it can't swim through the sky, can it?

271
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,909
What? A fish fly through the sky?

272
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,709
It doesn't say anything like that in his mail at all!

273
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,209
Look, it says, "I thought there was one fish, but there are three".

274
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,409
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three"

275
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,609
"How lucky the fish are."

276
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,709
Well, I guess so but...

277
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,309
If he's looking at that and thinking, "How lucky"...

278
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,809
Wouldn't it mean the three fish are swimming together?

279
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,709
Come to think of it, Mitsuru seemed lonesome

280
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,709
that his mother went back to her parental home,

281
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,709
and hasn't come back for quite a while.

282
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,009
Maybe he wanted to change places with the fish.

283
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,309
But, there are no fish in this world that swim in the sky.

284
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,509
Then, maybe he went to see that kind of a strange movie

285
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,009
with his father or something?

286
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,209
Because it was Children's Day just a while ago.

287
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,609
What? Children's Day?

288
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,009
May 5th...

289
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,509
Children's Day which means...

290
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:25,009
Ko... Koinobori!(Carp streamer)

291
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:30,409
Maybe Mitsuru could see Koinobori from where he is.

292
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:34,509
Koinobori are slack when there is no wind and look dead, don't they?

293
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,809
Which means he's at Kusarazu where there's no wind!

294
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:41,109
No, he says "I thought there was only one but there are three".

295
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:44,209
Which means there was no wind, but it began to blow.

296
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,309
Komaezaki, that's where we go!

297
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,309
Daddy.

298
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,909
Daddy.

299
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,409
I feel strange.

300
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:03,509
It's hot and I feel sick.

301
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,809
Daddy.

302
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,509
What? Heatstroke?

303
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,509
You mean Mitsuru?

304
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:16,309
Yeah, if he is locked up in a car for six hours under the hot sun,

305
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,309
it's very likely.

306
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,509
He may already be dehydrated by now.

307
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:24,209
By the way, Ran, did you contact the Komaezaki police?

308
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,209
Yes, but they say there are a lot of fishing spots

309
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,409
and it may be difficult to find him.

310
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:30,809
What shall I do? It's all my fault.

311
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:34,509
If only... if only I had told Mr. Mouri about it earlier...

312
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,309
Don't worry, we'll find him.

313
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,809
What?

314
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:41,909
Besides, it may be easier to find him when the sun sets.

315
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,709
Over here, we can see an overview of the town.

316
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:51,409
The thing to look for is the Koinobori, three of them.

317
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,909
Although Children's Day already passed,

318
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,809
there are still a lot of them left.

319
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,809
After all, it's the scenery and custom of this season.

320
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,909
It's going to be tough trying to single one out.

321
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,109
Wow! I found a really big net.

322
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,609
With that net, we can even catch a whale.

323
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,609
See, over there!

324
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,309
Idiot, that's a golf practice course.

325
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,409
It's surrounded by a big net so that the balls don't go flying outside.

326
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,609
So, it's not used for catching whales.

327
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,009
Don't tell me that...

328
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:26,709
Mitsuru saw the net and the Koinobori overlay each other and...

329
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,709
That's why he wrote that mail.

330
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:33,309
I see, a golf practice course with Koinobori nearby.

331
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:35,509
Where? Where? Where is it?

332
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:36,609
Oh!

333
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,909
There it is, over there!

334
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,309
"Parking Lot"

335
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,209
Mitsuru!

336
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,709
Where are you?

337
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,609
Please answer me!

338
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,409
This is the only parking lot where the two look

339
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:54,609
one on top of the other.

340
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,409
But it sure is a large place.

341
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,209
I'm sure he's some place there, though,

342
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,909
so check the inside of the cars carefully and look for him!

343
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,509
Okay.

344
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,109
Mitsuru! Mitsuru!

345
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:09,509
Come to think of it, it said in his mail.

346
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:12,909
The place where the golf practice course and the Koinobori overlap

347
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,109
as well as the place where he can see the sign of the restaurant.

348
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,409
I found him! Mitsuru is over here!

349
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,309
No good, the door is locked. It won't open!

350
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,909
Mitsuru, Mitsuru!

351
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,109
Stand back.

352
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,809
Azusa from Poirot!

353
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:48,609
Mitsuru!

354
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,009
Azusa, why? What's the matter?

355
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:53,309
Hurry, open the door!

356
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,009
But Daddy said to stay in the car.

357
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:01,109
It's okay. Please listen to me!

358
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,109
Oh.

359
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,209
Okay.

360
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:06,809
Mitsuru!

361
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,309
It sure feels good outside, after all.

362
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,809
Well, he looks to be...

363
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,409
Fine.

364
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:20,509
They're supposed to be fishing out at sea

365
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,609
and yet these poles are for river fishing...

366
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,609
There's no cooler box in sight too.

367
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,209
Why?

368
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:30,809
I wonder if Mitsuru's father came here for another reason.

369
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:34,109
I wonder what happened to that guy.

370
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:37,109
Oh, you mean that guy that got messed up in the fight.

371
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,209
Hey, the guy that got messed up in a fight, where'd he go?

372
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,709
Who the heck are you?

373
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,309
Never mind, just tell me!

374
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,609
I don't know. He seems to have been bleeding from the head, though.

375
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,809
I heard the ambulance so he was probably taken to the hospital.

376
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:52,909
Hospital?

377
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,109
Hey, Mitsuru!

378
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,209
-Daddy! -Mitsuru!

379
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,009
I'm glad, you're okay!

380
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,709
Where were you?

381
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:07,709
I was all by myself until Azusa and the others came to get me!

382
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,709
Oh, I'm sorry.

383
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,709
Oh, you're the one working at Poirot.

384
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,509
Yes, I read the mails from Mitsuru,

385
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,809
and had Mr. Mouri and the others come with me to check on him.

386
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,309
Hello.

387
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:22,609
Oh, thank you so very much.

388
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,109
The thing is...

389
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,609
What? You jerk!

390
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:27,609
You wanna fight?

391
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,109
Hey, stop it! Cut it out, you guys!

392
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,509
-You jerk! -Shut up!

393
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,809
Gosh!

394
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,209
Ouch.

395
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:44,309
I passed out and was at the hospital till a while ago.

396
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,309
But, Mitsuru,

397
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,609
I have a really big present in place for making you wait so long.

398
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,609
Mommy! Mommy!

399
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,609
Mommy!

400
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:08,209
I'm home, Mitsuru.

401
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:11,609
I see, his mother looks like you, Azusa.

402
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,109
Is that why he mailed me?

403
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,409
Your wife was hospitalized three months because of tuberculosis?

404
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,509
Yes, we didn't want to worry Mitsuru

405
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:24,509
so we told him that she went back to grandma's place.

406
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,109
They don't really allow visitors either when you have T.B. so...

407
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,709
The physical exam for whether she could be discharged or not was today.

408
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,009
Since I wanted Mitsuru to be able to see her as soon as possible,

409
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,109
I brought him along saying let's go fishing.

410
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,309
But, I was surprised out of my wits.

411
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:44,409
When I came to, my wife was worriedly watching over me instead.

412
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,909
And what about the result of the exam?

413
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:48,109
Of course.

414
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,909
I won't go anywhere anymore.

415
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,709
We'll stay together forever.

416
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,709
Really?

417
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,209
All right!

418
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:59,409
I'm glad, all three got together fine.

419
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,409
I wish all three of us can get together again soon too.

420
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:46,409
I guess I'll just kind of tag along then.

421
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,309
You were almost killed?

422
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,409
The method of murder is also the same.

423
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,409
This is not a coincidence.

424
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:56,509
It's not a coincidence for sure.

425
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:58,709
This novel is a warning of future murder.

426
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,409
Look out!

427
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:04,409
As long as I'm here, I won't let them kill you!

428
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,109
Why? For what reason is this person...

429
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,909
Hold it! Don't open it!

430
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:16,909
Next Conan, "So, Disappear Everybody"

431
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:19,794
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:22,194
"Novel"

433
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,494
Ran, any words for the 10th anniversary of this series?

434
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:24,894
Shinichi, just how long do you expect to keep me waiting?

435
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:26,840
-I'm sorry. -Did you say something just now?
