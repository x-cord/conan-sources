1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,540
We've come to visit the Tori no Ichi at the Ranburi Shrine.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,340
Ran and Sonoko wanted to come

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,040
to choose an oracle that tells fortunes of love, called the Lovely Oracle.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,440
However, the Lovely Oracle

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,840
was not the only thing that appeared at Tori no Ichi.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,140
A purse snatcher wearing a funny face mask,

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,240
called the Rooster Man also appeared.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Sonoko's bag is also snatched away by this culprit.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,140
We visited the Ranburi Shrine again during San no Tori.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,140
But, there again, Rooster Man appears,

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,740
stabs a university student named Mr. Shiro Masuko and wounds him.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,840
Just before passing out,

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,940
Mr. Masuko says, "It's not a rooster, but a monkey"

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,740
and used fingers of both his hands to indicate the number 9.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,740
What on earth does this mean?

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,440
There were three men in the toilet

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,740
that Rooster Man locked himself up in.

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,140
Mr. Tatsuo Hino,

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,740
Mr. Hisami Sarukawa,

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,840
or Mr. Shinji Mizunoe?

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Is Rooster Man among the three men?

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,540
We find out that the button that is found in Ran's coin purse

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,040
may be something that Rooster Man had dropped

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,240
when he bumped into Ran at the previous Tori no Ichi.

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,840
So, the houses of the three men were investigated.

26
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,640
But it looks like this case

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
is not going to be solved as easily it was first thought to be.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,440
Brooding over passing seasons

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,540
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,140
A mysterious shadow closes in on Ran.

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,940
The 9 monkeys and Rooster Man mystery is finally solved.

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

35
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:05,803
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 2)"

36
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:12,003
What? You couldn't find it?

37
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:13,203
You mean you couldn't find the clothes

38
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,803
that the button came off from in the houses of the three?

39
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:17,803
No. Although it seems they just took a quick look

40
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:20,403
because no search warrant was issued.

41
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:21,703
It seems that there were no clothes

42
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,103
with the same type of button on them either.

43
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,503
We asked the family members of the three too,

44
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:30,703
but it seems that there were no clothes that suddenly disappeared either.

45
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,803
It's highly unlikely that the button

46
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:34,703
was disposed of after the crime either then.

47
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:38,003
Yes. So maybe the button that Ran picked up

48
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,303
was something that just happened to be there.

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,703
Oh. Is that so?

50
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:45,603
By the way, we asked the family members

51
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,903
and found that on the day of Ichi no Tori,

52
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:50,603
Mr. Hino was on a trip to Sendai with his family.

53
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:53,503
Mr. Sarukawa has an alibi during Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori,

54
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,703
both at the time the crime was committed.

55
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,103
Mr. Mizunoe seems to have been

56
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:01,303
on a business trip to Nagasaki on the day of Ni no Tori.

57
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:04,103
In addition, at Ichi no Tori when he was attacked by Rooster Man,

58
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,603
he seems to have filed a complaint at the police.

59
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:07,803
I see.

60
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,603
Which means that be it at Ichi no Tori,

61
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:12,703
Ni no Tori or San no tori, none of the men

62
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,803
among the three could've committed the crime.

63
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:19,703
By the way, we got a call from the hospital just a while ago

64
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:23,203
saying that Mr. Shiro Masuko had regained consciousness.

65
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,903
-And? -It seems that he's saying that he has no recollection

66
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,503
of being stabbed by Rooster Man

67
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,703
or having said anything about a monkey or the number 9.

68
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,003
I see.

69
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:36,303
He doesn't remember? What does that mean?

70
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,903
Inspector! I found it!

71
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,703
Mr. Mizunoe's bank account

72
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:42,203
was found inside Rooster Man's knapsack!

73
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,703
You found it?

74
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:47,803
Yes! That bank book was in somebody else's bag,

75
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,703
so it took a while for us to confirm it.

76
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:51,003
Somebody else's bag?

77
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:54,203
Yes. We had the people who were attacked

78
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:57,803
at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori confirm whether it was their bags or not.

79
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:00,403
But since the contents were all out of sorts.

80
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,803
Come to think of it,

81
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:04,903
there was a handkerchief that I never saw inside my bag too.

82
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:07,803
The oracle that I'm sure I put inside the bag was gone too.

83
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,703
You're referring to that thing called the Lovely Oracle, aren't you?

84
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:12,403
I saw it in another bag.

85
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:16,403
Something about a nervous and old fashioned boyfriend.

86
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:20,203
Hey, you don't have to go revealing the contents!

87
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:23,303
Nervous and old fashioned type?

88
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:26,603
But I wonder why the contents were all messed up.

89
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:30,103
I'm sure Rooster Man took the contents of the bags

90
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:33,203
that he stole out and put them back again randomly.

91
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,603
And? Did the victims of Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori

92
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,803
confirm that it was their bags that was stolen by Rooster Man?

93
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:42,103
Yes, so there's no doubt

94
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:45,303
that the culprit of all three cases is the same person.

95
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,203
So, now everything is clear, isn't it?

96
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:48,303
Yeah.

97
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:52,103
It means that there's a liar among the onlookers here

98
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,803
passing around rumors that Rooster Man ran into the toilet.

99
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,703
True.

100
00:05:56,703 --> 00:06:00,703
Because there seems to be no one

101
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:05,003
among us who could've visited all three festivals.

102
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:07,003
Okay then, I guess we get to go.

103
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:08,203
It's okay, isn't it?

104
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:10,603
I'm sure my wife is worried to so.

105
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,603
Yes. I guess so, for today.

106
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:17,303
Move.

107
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:19,003
Move it, I said!

108
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,503
Strange.

109
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:22,203
I guess the contents of the bags that were stolen

110
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,403
being all messed up isn't much of a problem,

111
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:28,103
but why was he carrying something like that around?

112
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:29,603
If he were caught with it,

113
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:30,703
he wouldn't be able to get away with it,

114
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,803
since it would serve as proof against him.

115
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:34,003
The reactions of the three

116
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:36,103
when Ran said that she had found the button

117
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,903
that may belong to Rooster Man also bother me.

118
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:41,203
If Rooster Man was among them,

119
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:43,103
even if the button didn't come off,

120
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,303
just the thought that it may have,

121
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,703
should've thrown him into panic.

122
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:49,603
It normally would make him cold sweat and panic.

123
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:57,003
I see. He ran and perspired,

124
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:59,203
so that he could distract everyone from the fact

125
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:00,903
that he was perspiring from panic.

126
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:04,103
Wait a sec. Even if he were the culprit,

127
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:08,503
he couldn't have gone to all three festivals that were held?

128
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:10,203
If so, there has to be somebody

129
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:13,603
other than him who is Rooster Man,

130
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,503
but the knapsack had things

131
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,403
that were stolen from all three festivals inside it.

132
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:23,003
Besides, what does monkey and the number 9 mean?

133
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,403
What on earth does it mean?

134
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:29,303
What's the matter, Conan? Why that dreadfully serious look?

135
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:33,303
Yep. I was just wondering what monkey and the number 9 mean.

136
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,703
Monkey and 9 (Saru and Kyu).

137
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:38,203
Dad, what brings you here?

138
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,003
I heard that Rooster Man appeared again

139
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,603
and that you guys came to,

140
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:45,303
so I got worried and came to pick you up.

141
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,303
It was big news on TV

142
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,603
that the guy who was stabbed

143
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:52,403
left a mysterious message of monkey and the number 9 behind.

144
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:56,603
What the word "kyu" brings to mind for me is...

145
00:07:56,603 --> 00:08:00,203
kyukancho (myna bird), kyukyusha (ambulance),

146
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:04,003
takkyu (table tennis) or yakyu (baseball)!

147
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:08,903
But, I don't recall any baseball ground with the word Saru in it.

148
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:13,603
Talking of baseball grounds, the Koshien Kyujo,

149
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:16,103
what is it called Koshien (monkey-child-park)?

150
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:19,003
Was there a place called Koshien in that area?

151
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,903
Yes, there is! Like Koshien Station.

152
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:23,103
No.

153
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,803
The name of the place was named what it is now,

154
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,003
after the Koshien Baseball Park was made there.

155
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:29,903
And the year the Koshien Baseball Park was built is...

156
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:34,103
What about the year it was built?

157
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,703
I see. So, that's what it was...

158
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:39,703
The victim knew the culprit.

159
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,803
That's why he referred to the 9th monkey.

160
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,003
Okay, let's go home!

161
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,503
Oh, I forgot!

162
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:51,703
I've got to go pick up my laundry at the cleaners before I go home.

163
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:54,703
Dad, will you go on ahead and take Conan and Sonoko home!

164
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,803
You can go pick it up tomorrow!

165
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,503
You're attending a friend's wedding tomorrow, aren't you, Dad?

166
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:24,503
Where's the cleaners?

167
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,003
Hey, ole man, you bump into us,

168
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:35,403
and think you can get away just walking off like that?

169
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,703
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,903
If you really feel bad about it, give us your wallet.

171
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:42,303
What?

172
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,403
Don't worry!

173
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,903
All we're taking from you is enough to go drinking!

174
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,803
If you mug him, I'm calling the police!

175
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:54,303
Hey lady, you're punky, aren't you?

176
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,203
You're pretty cute too.

177
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:58,503
You wanna come play with us?

178
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,503
Those punks.

179
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:05,003
In order to capture that heart of a nervous and old-fashioned type like him,

180
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:08,003
it's best to be a Japanese woman with all the traditional graces.

181
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:11,603
Tomboys and girls that prefer flashy fashion are a no-no!

182
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:14,803
Stay graceful and refined.

183
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:19,603
It will surely bring you closer together.

184
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,703
I'm just saying that committing a crime is not good.

185
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,103
What's with her?

186
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:28,103
What is it? What's going on? Is it a fight?

187
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:31,303
-Hey, let's get out of here -Yeah.

188
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,703
Take care!

189
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:41,003
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

190
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,803
Not at all.

191
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:45,303
Acting like a tomboy is a no, no!

192
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:47,703
I've got to stay gracefully refined.

193
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:54,103
What? You've found out who Rooster Man is?

194
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,903
Which means, you've figured out the meaning of the word monkey

195
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,903
and number 9 that the university student who was stabbed remarked of?

196
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:02,603
Yep. The man who was stabbed

197
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:05,203
knew the man who stabbed him!

198
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:08,303
That's why he said, "He's not a rooster, but a monkey",

199
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:10,403
and showed nine of his fingers.

200
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,003
Then, it's that man

201
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,703
that has a monkey looking face called Tatsuo Hino, right?

202
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,003
If they knew each other,

203
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:16,103
he would know the face of the one who stabbed him, wouldn't he?

204
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:19,403
But, he has nothing to do with the number 9, does he?

205
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:22,503
Then, is it the man called Hisami Sarukawa?

206
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,703
His nickname seems to be Kyu-chan too.

207
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:27,203
Besides if he was close enough to know the nickname of the culprit.

208
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,303
I'm sure he would've mentioned the nickname

209
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,503
and directly say that the culprit is Sarukawa.

210
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:35,703
But the only one left is Shinji Mizunoe then?

211
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:38,503
What's monkey and number 9 about him?

212
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:41,303
The character "tori" that is used for Tori no Ichi refers to the "tori"

213
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:43,203
as know in the twelve horary signs of the lunar calendar, right?

214
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,403
So what about the monkey character?

215
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,903
Well...

216
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,403
The character "shin" is the character

217
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:51,603
used in the name of Shinji Mizunoe.

218
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:54,403
But, what about the number 9?

219
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:58,303
I just talked about the Koshien Baseball grounds just now, didn't I?

220
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:01,203
It was named "Koshien" because it was built

221
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:04,503
in 1924, the year of the monkey,

222
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:07,003
the animal sign that indicates that year.

223
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:09,003
The year of the monkey?

224
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:11,303
The sexagenary cycle!

225
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:15,503
Ko, Otsu, Hei, Tei, Bo, Ki, Ko, Shin,

226
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,903
Jin, Ki, the 10 celestial stems.

227
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,603
And the twelve branches, Shi, Chu, In, Bo, Shin,

228
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:26,003
Shi, Go, Bi, Shin, Yu, Jutsu, and Gai combined,

229
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:30,303
make up the sexagenary cycle that makes one round every 60 years.

230
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:32,303
Therefore, the word "koshi"

231
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:34,703
is the celestial stem "ko" and "shi" of the branch combined,

232
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:38,303
so it is the first year of the 60 year cycle!

233
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,503
That's why the baseball stadium was named Koshien,

234
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,603
because it was built that year.

235
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,203
Then what is the 9th year?

236
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,403
The 9th is

237
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:50,003
Koshi, Otchu, Heiin,

238
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:54,103
Teibo, Boshin, Kishi, Kogo, Shinbi, and

239
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,503
Jinshin.

240
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:57,803
You mean like in the Jinshin War!

241
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:01,403
You can say it in other Japanese reading form, too, can't you?

242
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:03,603
Like in "Hinoeuma".

243
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:07,503
The other way of reading for Jinshin is...

244
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,303
Mizunoe, saru...

245
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:12,103
Mizunoe? Shinji Mizunoe!

246
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,803
It's literally what it is!

247
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:16,803
As proof of that, the man called Mizunoe,

248
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,903
attempted to show us the receipt he received

249
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:20,703
at the convenience store, but didn't, right?

250
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:24,203
That's because when he was fleeing disguised as Rooster Man,

251
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,303
the receipt that was in the pocket of his pants got wet from perspiration!

252
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:30,303
And if he shows a wet receipt,

253
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:33,003
the fact that he ran would be disclosed!

254
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,203
The only things that were disposed of in the tool closet

255
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:38,003
in the restroom that Rooster Man took flight into

256
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,503
were the murder weapon knife,

257
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:43,203
a down jacket and the mask of a funny face!

258
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,603
I see.

259
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:47,303
He had everything ready beforehand, except for his pants,

260
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:49,703
which he didn't have any change for.

261
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,903
But, wait!

262
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:54,903
Didn't Officer Takagi say that Mizunoe was on a business trip

263
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,803
and didn't go to the Ni no Tori?

264
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,203
Besides, his bag was stolen by Rooster Man at Ichi no Tori

265
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:01,703
and he even filed a complaint

266
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,903
for stolen items at the police too, right?

267
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:05,303
That's right.

268
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,303
Because the Rooster Man who stabbed Mr. Masuko today

269
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,503
at San no Tori was that man called Mizunoe,

270
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,103
but Rooster Man who appeared at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori

271
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,303
was Mr. Masuko!

272
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:20,503
It's most likely that Mr. Masuko was threatening Mr. Mizunoe

273
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,003
because of the bank book

274
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:24,803
that was in the bag that Mr. Masuko stole from him.

275
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:27,203
He was probably threatened because of dirty money or embezzlement.

276
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:30,903
Masuko most likely demanded cash to keep his mouth shut.

277
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,503
You're saying that Mr. Masuko

278
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:34,003
deliberately put all the things he stole

279
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,203
at Ichi no Tori and Ni no Tori in the knapsack

280
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:37,603
and brought it along with him?

281
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:40,803
Yeah. Mizunoe probably told him

282
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:44,103
to bring the bank book as well as everything

283
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:47,903
that he had stolen up to now

284
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:50,203
when coming to make the deal!

285
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:53,103
He then stabbed Mr. Masuko who came along,

286
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:54,703
left the stolen items behind

287
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:57,603
and disguise himself as Rooster Man, then fled.

288
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:59,503
Since he has an alibi when it comes to Ni no Tori,

289
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,103
he wouldn't be suspected.

290
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,903
I see! Since Mr. Masuko who was stabbed back then,

291
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,503
was aiming to be a literature major,

292
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:07,903
and all that was written on the bank book

293
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:09,303
were the name and address of the culprit,

294
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:12,203
the word monkey and the number 9 crossed his mind!

295
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,003
So, maybe he said that

296
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,203
he didn't remember anything

297
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:18,103
after regaining consciousness at the hospital because...

298
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:20,103
When he was stabbed, he was probably so vexed

299
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:24,003
that he left behind the word monkey and number 9 that indicated the culprit.

300
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:27,103
But, after calming down and thinking it over,

301
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,503
he realized that if people found out what he meant,

302
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:32,003
it would reveal that he is in fact Rooster Man.

303
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:34,503
So he decided to not say anything.

304
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:37,303
But there's no proof.

305
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,403
It would be great is somebody would pick up the things

306
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,903
that Rooster Man dropped.

307
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,703
Right! The button that Ran picked up at Ni no Tori

308
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,903
after Rooster Man bumped into her!

309
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:51,403
If clothes missing that button is found in Mr. Masuko's house,

310
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:54,403
then it would serve as proof, right?

311
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:57,403
Because Rooster Man that appeared at Ni no Tori is Mr. Masuko.

312
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,203
Well, if the guy Masuko confesses

313
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:02,003
and spits it out about Mizunoe,

314
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,503
then the case will be closed.

315
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:07,303
You're both great with deduction!

316
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:10,303
Just as would be expected of the Deduction Queen and Sleeping Kogoro!

317
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,703
Oh, well...

318
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,803
Piece of cake!

319
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,703
But somehow...

320
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,903
It does feel like something's not right.

321
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,703
At any rate, let's tell Officer Takagi

322
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,003
and the others about the button

323
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:22,603
and have them check on it!

324
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:25,103
On whether or not clothes missing that button

325
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:27,403
is in Mr. Masuko's house!

326
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:44,603
Maybe I sent a little too much out to the cleaners.

327
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:59,366
What? You gave the button back to Ran?

328
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,666
Why? It's evidence, isn't it?

329
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:06,366
Oh, no. Back then, it wasn't determined as evidence yet.

330
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:09,066
And she said that it could have fallen off her father's clothes,

331
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,766
so that she wanted to take it home and check on it.

332
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,766
Hey, you'd better be sure that the guy called Mizunoe

333
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:18,466
is not going to attack Ran because he wants to get rid of the button.

334
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:20,666
Ran will be okay!

335
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,566
She's strong.

336
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,466
Something's wrong.

337
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,466
Ran's not answering the phone since a while ago.

338
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:29,066
-What? -What?

339
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,366
Wallet...

340
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:43,266
There... Here it is.

341
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,466
So long as I get rid of the button,

342
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,566
there's no danger of me being suspected anymore.

343
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:53,566
Mr. Mizunoe?

344
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,166
Is it you?

345
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,566
Oh, that button!

346
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,566
Yeah, that's right.

347
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:03,066
This is from the guy I failed to kill today.

348
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,966
The button that belongs to Rooster Man.

349
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,966
Rooster Man that you failed to kill.

350
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,966
Wasn't that man stabbed by Rooster Man?

351
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:15,166
That's why I'm telling you that university student was Rooster Man!

352
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,566
What?

353
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:21,266
That punk. He saw the bank book that he stole from me

354
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,366
and realized that I'm embezzling money from my company.

355
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:28,166
Well, it's strange that nobody

356
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,866
noticed that the same amount of money

357
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:33,466
was being deposited to my account every month

358
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:37,866
that belonged to a company that doesn't even exist.

359
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,766
That guy had the nerve to say

360
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:43,366
that he'd give me back my bank book

361
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,866
but he didn't know which bag was mine.

362
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,966
That's why I told him

363
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:51,866
to bring everything he stole up to now so I can check for myself.

364
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:55,766
That's why I disguised myself as Rooster Man just today.

365
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,066
Too bad, it seems that he made it through.

366
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,566
But, I don't think he'll talk,

367
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:03,266
because he's a chicken that was saying

368
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:06,966
that he stole to relieve the stress of having to study for his exam.

369
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,066
Don't you think it's strange?

370
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:15,966
Why do you think I'm talking my head off like this?

371
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:23,466
Miss, it's because you're going to have to die.

372
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,066
Right here and now.

373
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:34,566
Ran...

374
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,766
I think you should turn yourself in.

375
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:42,866
Nobody's dead yet.

376
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,466
But, if you keep on adding to your crime...

377
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:49,766
Begging for your life? Yeah, I guess you don't want to die.

378
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:53,266
You probably haven't fell in and out of love much yet.

379
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:59,066
And, I found a Lovely fortune oracle still sealed in your wallet too.

380
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,466
Still sealed?

381
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,566
Don't tell me that Sonoko...

382
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,966
She snatched the Lovely Fortune oracle from me back then

383
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,566
and feigned reading it,

384
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:12,166
but maybe she read her own oracle and not mine.

385
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:16,766
I guess I'll read it for you as a gift to you before you go to Hades.

386
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,666
In order to grab the heart of an intelligent boy like him,

387
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,866
it's best to be yourself.

388
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:28,866
Beware because he'll see right through you

389
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:32,266
if you try to adorn yourself or act like a cutie-pie!

390
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,566
Go through with the natural openness that you possess.

391
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:39,366
Believe in yourself and push on forward,

392
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:43,766
then your feelings for him will surely reach him.

393
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,066
So it says!

394
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,366
Ran...

395
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:45,566
We didn't have to worry after all.

396
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,966
What was that flashy technique you just struck?

397
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:51,266
Torso spin kick!

398
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,466
Kazumi, my senior taught it to me the other day!

399
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:57,166
Oh, I see.

400
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,866
Oh, he's the real culprit and...

401
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:02,066
Yes, we know!

402
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:05,966
But, Ran! Wasn't tomboyish actions a no, no?

403
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,366
That's what your oracle said, right?

404
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,266
Mine said...

405
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,666
In order to grab the heart of an intelligent boy like him,

406
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,866
it's best to be yourself.

407
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,366
Beware because he'll see right through you

408
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:22,066
if you try to adorn yourself or act like a cutie-pie!

409
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:25,066
Go through with the natural openness that you possess.

410
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:28,366
Believe in yourself and push on forward,

411
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,266
then your feelings for him will surely reach him!

412
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:32,966
I like this!

413
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,866
Change it with mine, will you!

414
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,466
No way!

415
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:40,766
Well, I guess it just goes to show that women have to be strong!

416
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:45,066
You're too strong.

417
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,466
Delicious! Fantastic!

418
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:53,066
Mr. Miyake!

419
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,866
This is a selection of the 7 wonders.

420
00:23:56,866 --> 00:24:00,366
Those two, I'm sure they're somehow involved.

421
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,666
Mr. Koshiji?

422
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,066
There are three more 7 wonders left.

423
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:08,166
Is something more going to happen?

424
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,366
Besides, what's with that man?

425
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,766
Next Conan,

426
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:16,745
"Hiroshima, Miyajima 7 Wonders Tour (Miyajima Edition)"

427
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,192
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,892
"Fire"

429
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:23,992
The next episode is about a mystery tour to Hiroshima.

430
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:25,292
It's snacks with beer!

431
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,629
I thought so.
