1
00:00:00,924 --> 00:00:02,624
In the morning of our day off,

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:04,224
in order to do our homework of sketching,

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:07,124
we came to the suburbs of Beika City.

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:10,824
-Hey. -Don't tell me that, that's a...

5
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:12,624
No doubt about!

6
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:15,024
That's indeed a UFO!

7
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:16,524
An Adamsky type!

8
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:18,624
It really existed!

9
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,324
Hey, hey.

10
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:21,724
Conan Edogawa.

11
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,224
Look.

12
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,724
What on earth...

13
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,624
Aim for a 100% solution.

14
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:36,924
Clear all mysteries and codes.

15
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:38,724
A UFO crashes and is found in the dry riverbed.

16
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:40,924
What is the secret that the victim hid?

17
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:44,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:46,524
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:36,646
"Unbelievable! UFO Crashes"

21
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:41,046
-Right now, we know that... -Officer Takagi!

22
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:44,446
You!

23
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,746
You shouldn't do this!

24
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:48,946
You're supposed let children into the site.

25
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:53,346
Well, but they insisted that they are your friends, so...

26
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:55,646
Friends maybe, but...

27
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:59,146
What an unlucky person, though.

28
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,346
To be crushed by a UFO

29
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,646
that came flying from way out in outer space.

30
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:06,546
Hey... You shouldn't be here!

31
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,746
Did they find the spaceman that was on board?

32
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:11,646
Huh? No... Well, rather...

33
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:13,146
Did he get away?

34
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:16,446
I guess you would call it hit-and-run in earth terms?

35
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,546
-Yeah. -No, that's not it.

36
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,746
Hey, Officer Takagi.

37
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:24,946
The flap of his pocket is ripped off.

38
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,046
Yeah.

39
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:29,146
It seems he hooked it onto something and it got torn.

40
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,946
Rather, give me a break, Conan.

41
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,446
He's wearing clothes that pretty flashy.

42
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,046
Who is he, anyway?

43
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:39,946
Yes...

44
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:44,646
The victim is Mr. Osamu Iwabuchi of Beikacho, age 22.

45
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:48,246
The estimated time of death is around 01:00 yesterday.

46
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:51,446
He was crushed twice by that UFO and died.

47
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,846
This is all the information we have for now.

48
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,246
Now that you know, hurry out of here.

49
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:58,846
He was crushed twice.

50
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,746
Two bruises in two separate places were seen on the corpse.

51
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:07,146
Well, on the 2nd bruise, there were no signs of life.

52
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,746
It seems he died from the first impact.

53
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:13,146
At any rate, I can't afford to have Inspector Megure

54
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:15,246
see me with you people.

55
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:17,546
I found it!

56
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:20,046
Here you are!

57
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:22,646
-Who is he? -I wonder.

58
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,946
I looked all over for you!

59
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:28,646
My flying saucer!

60
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,446
Hey, you!

61
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:34,146
Just what're you doing? Get down!

62
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:35,746
Give it back to me!

63
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:39,946
Give it back? Who on earth are you?

64
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,346
Me? I'm...

65
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:47,646
I'm Doctor Shozo Konuma, a physicist.

66
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:50,646
I worked alone for 30 years for this!

67
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:55,146
I absorbed all my time and energy for this flying saucer!

68
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,346
What?

69
00:04:56,346 --> 00:05:00,146
You mean it didn't come flying from outer space?

70
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,646
Exactly!

71
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,346
It came from my research lab a little ways from here.

72
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,346
But it's still incomplete. I wonder how it flew over here.

73
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,346
How strange.

74
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:16,146
I'm part-timing at night at a convenience store.

75
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:17,246
To make money for this research,

76
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,446
I also went to work last night,

77
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,646
and when I returned to the lab this morning, it was gone.

78
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:25,346
Well, if the person who made it says it's incomplete,

79
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:27,046
there's no way it could fly.

80
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:28,346
-But... -But...

81
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,346
Doctor Konuma.

82
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:33,946
Wasn't that truck also at the lab last night?

83
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,346
That?

84
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:38,946
It's true that I always have it parked with the key inside it.

85
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:41,646
Because it's troublesome to look for the key.

86
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:43,946
Then, the story's simple.

87
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:46,646
That UFO didn't come flying,

88
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,546
but was brought here by someone on that truck.

89
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:50,846
I see.

90
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:53,246
Come to think of it, it's so simple.

91
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,346
What a waste it was to get thrilled over it.

92
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,946
But if it didn't come flying here,

93
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:01,146
why was he crushed by that UFO?

94
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,746
What? Did my flying saucer crush somebody?

95
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:07,846
We, the police think this is a homicide.

96
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,846
Homicide?

97
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,146
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:15,646
The culprit probably fainted the victim Mr. Iwabuchi beforehand,

99
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,846
laid him down in this dry riverbed.

100
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,446
Then dropped the flying saucer that he brought from your lab

101
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,346
down from the bridge.

102
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:25,846
-And twice, too. -My god.

103
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:27,746
But, Officer Takagi...

104
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:32,146
Why did the culprit go out of his way to use the flying saucer?

105
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,946
That's what bothers me.

106
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,946
At any rate, Dr. Konuma,

107
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,646
would you please take us to your lab?

108
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:43,546
I don't mind, but will you give this back to me?

109
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:47,546
I'm sorry, but it's a vital piece of evidence.

110
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,946
Just as I thought.

111
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:52,846
Okay, kids. Leave the rest to the police.

112
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,846
Yep!

113
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,046
We have to work on doing our homework of sketching.

114
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,046
Hang in there, Officer Takagi.

115
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,146
-Bye. -See you later.

116
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:04,446
See you.

117
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:09,646
Can you really make a flying saucer in a place like this?

118
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,546
True.

119
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,046
Why are you here?

120
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,446
What do you mean why?

121
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:18,546
Of course we came here to sketch this lab!

122
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:19,746
Is that so?

123
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:23,046
The exterior is probably shabby to protect secrecy,

124
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,246
to keep everyone else away from here!

125
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,246
I see!

126
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:30,246
Then, I'll bet the inside is full of super computers and such!

127
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:33,346
Okay, let's look inside then!

128
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:35,346
Yeah!

129
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:38,246
I wonder about that.

130
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,346
"Let the UFO fly to outer space"

131
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:52,146
How do you like my Konuma Flying Saucer research laboratory?

132
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:55,746
At any rate, we need clues to the culprit.

133
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,646
-Let's search. -Yep.

134
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,746
Right.

135
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,346
Where was that flying saucer kept?

136
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:03,946
It was suspended over there.

137
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:07,846
I wanted to dream of it flying.

138
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:10,746
He had it hanging from the ceiling.

139
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,046
It sure is rusty.

140
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,046
It probably broke off

141
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,746
when the culprit removed the flying saucer.

142
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,046
It seems to have been ready to broke off to begin with, anyway.

143
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:29,946
Officer Takagi.

144
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:32,546
Look.

145
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,046
There's something like this here.

146
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,946
It's not mine.

147
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,746
Just as I thought.

148
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:40,246
There's something that looks like a name here.

149
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:41,846
Mannen?

150
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:43,446
Mannen...

151
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:45,146
I don't know that name!

152
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:47,046
It's the culprit's hat!

153
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:49,446
The culprit's name is Mannen.

154
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,746
Conan. Over here.

155
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:56,746
-This is... -Yep.

156
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,746
It's his, right?

157
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:03,346
I didn't see that piece of cloth yesterday, though.

158
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:06,546
Which means that, not only this person called Mannen,

159
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,746
but Mr. Iwabuchi who was killed was also here.

160
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,646
They probably came here together.

161
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:15,146
-Chiba. -I investigated and found that

162
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:16,946
Mr. Osamu Iwabuchi had a person

163
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,946
that he thought of as a brother, that he got along with.

164
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,246
This is the victim, Mr. Iwabuchi.

165
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:23,346
Yes.

166
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:27,546
And the other half of this odd couple is Sadao Mannen.

167
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,146
He is like a "big brother" to Mr. Iwabuchi.

168
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:30,746
-Mannen? -Mannen?

169
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:33,246
And these two were at a restaurant yesterday.

170
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,046
That's why I'm telling you that I'll pay off

171
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,446
everything I owe you altogether tomorrow!

172
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,546
Right, "Buchi"?

173
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:43,546
We're expecting big cash to come in.

174
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:46,746
It's highly probably that they broke in here last night

175
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,546
to search for valuables.

176
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,646
But if Mannen is the culprit,

177
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:53,246
why would he have killed his "kid brother"?

178
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,546
That too, but it's hard to think that

179
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:59,346
they came here to look for cash too, though, no?

180
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:01,446
True. No offense,

181
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:04,046
but there's nothing here that looks valuable enough to sell off.

182
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:08,446
There is! That treasure!

183
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:09,546
"Let the UFO fly to outer space"

184
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:11,946
I bought at the end of last month.

185
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,046
It seems to be the work of a famous calligrapher,

186
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,046
and cost me 50,000 yen!

187
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,346
-50,000 yen? -50,000 yen?

188
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:20,846
It was sold to me at this very cheap price

189
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:23,346
because the seller thought it was just the thing for me.

190
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:25,846
He was a man called Mr. Okura.

191
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:29,546
Well, that's not it.

192
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,146
Okura...

193
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:34,246
Do you mean Kinji Okura?

194
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:35,546
Yes.

195
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:38,046
Kinji Okura, the loan shark?

196
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,346
Yes. Mannen and Iwabuchi

197
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:44,346
were both hired by him as money collectors.

198
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,946
They were henchmen of Okura!

199
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,546
Is Mr. Okura a problem?

200
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:53,046
He's suspected of tax evasion.

201
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:57,546
The National Tax Office raided his place at the beginning of this month

202
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,546
for hiding assets in the billions,

203
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:01,946
but God knows where he hid it.

204
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:05,946
They weren't able to come up with the hidden asset after all.

205
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:11,846
So, that's the kind of guy he was, that Mr. Okura.

206
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,846
He's a money-monger.

207
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:18,046
He used to boast that anything under a million yen is not money.

208
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:20,046
-Strange. -Yeah.

209
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,246
I wonder if a guy like him

210
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,646
would sell a fake hanging scroll for 50,000 yen.

211
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:27,446
Then maybe the two snuck in here

212
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:30,546
by order of Mr. Okura?

213
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:34,746
No, Kinji Okura died the day before yesterday

214
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:36,846
in a traffic accident.

215
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:38,046
Huh?

216
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:40,746
But maybe he's not totally uninvolved, right?

217
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:43,646
Because the two people working under him suck into the place

218
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:46,846
where he sold the hanging scroll to.

219
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:49,646
It's true it doesn't seem like a coincidence.

220
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:51,546
Shall we go check on it?

221
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,346
The last people who saw Okura

222
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,846
at his death bed in Beika Central Hospital

223
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,946
seems to have been Mannen and Iwabuchi.

224
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,146
Okay, let's.

225
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,246
"Beika Central Hospital"

226
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:05,946
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

227
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:09,946
It's about Mr. Kinji Okura who was carried here by ambulance?

228
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,046
Could you tell us about his last moments?

229
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:17,546
But he was already unconscious when he got here.

230
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,946
He did say something strange just before he died.

231
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,746
What is it, boss?

232
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,846
U... UFO...

233
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,946
That was his last word.

234
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:37,446
UFO?

235
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,246
If you will excuse me.

236
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,346
UFO!

237
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:42,646
I got it.

238
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:45,146
I'm sorry, I have an emergency patient.

239
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:46,446
Thank you very much.

240
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:49,146
He was probably referring to that hanging scroll.

241
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:52,146
Huh? You...

242
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:56,246
Maybe he regretted selling something fake like that.

243
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,146
-Right. -Yep.

244
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:01,746
I wonder if he's someone that commendable.

245
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,546
Hey, Officer Chiba.

246
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:06,446
Mr. Okura loved money, didn't he?

247
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:08,246
Yeah.

248
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,246
The last words that a person like that would leave behind

249
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,646
would more or less be the same, wouldn't they?

250
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:26,096
Although Mr. Kinji Okura was thought

251
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,096
to have hidden assets of billions of yen,

252
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:31,796
they couldn't find it here in this office.

253
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:32,996
No.

254
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:35,696
Even his house was thoroughly search, too.

255
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:39,196
You said they did so at the beginning of this month, right?

256
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:42,296
And, just a little before that, at the end of last month,

257
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:46,296
Mr. Okura sold that hanging scroll to Dr. Konuma.

258
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,696
So?

259
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,396
A person like him who used say,

260
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,596
anything under a million yen is not money...

261
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,396
Would that kind of man go out of his way

262
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,996
to sell something for 50,000 yen?

263
00:13:55,996 --> 00:14:00,296
He probably sold it because he had another purpose.

264
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:02,096
Another purpose?

265
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,796
Depending on how you look at it,

266
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:07,596
you couldn't find a safer place than that lab, could you?

267
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,096
No robbers would attempt breaking in.

268
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,496
I see! Okura probably went to sell the hanging scroll

269
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:16,196
to hide his hidden assets?

270
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:18,096
He went to sell the hanging scroll

271
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:19,496
and when the Doctor wasn't looking,

272
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,596
he hid his assets somewhere in that lab!

273
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,696
As a temporary place of hiding,

274
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,996
that place where even a robber would stay away from is a safe place.

275
00:14:27,996 --> 00:14:30,796
The hanging scroll was just an excuse to go there.

276
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,796
He could care less about the 50,000 yen for it.

277
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:35,496
-Right. -Yep.

278
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:38,596
And the last words of Mr. Okura.

279
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:42,596
U... UFO...

280
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:45,896
Talking of UFO,

281
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,696
brings to mind that UFO research center.

282
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:49,196
Mannen and Iwabuchi realized that

283
00:14:49,196 --> 00:14:51,696
it was the place where the treasure was hidden.

284
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,596
They snuck in last night

285
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,596
to snatch that treasure away, then found it.

286
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:58,196
And although they got a long as "brothers" Sadao Mannen

287
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:00,996
who wanted the treasure for himself

288
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,896
killed Osamu Iwabuchi.

289
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,896
So, that's what happened.

290
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,696
If so, everything falls into place.

291
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,696
But you know, it's not everything.

292
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:13,596
Sort of.

293
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,496
Yes, sir. What?

294
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:17,996
Yes, I understand!

295
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:19,796
What's up, Chiba?

296
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:20,796
It's from the Beika police

297
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,196
where I asked to have look for Sadao Mannen.

298
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:26,596
They found that he is in debt with the people he works with

299
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:30,196
and is still running from them.

300
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,696
If he got a hold of billions of cash,

301
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,796
he would've returned his debt first thing, wouldn't he?

302
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:37,196
Which means, the treasure hasn't been found yet?

303
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,296
That's the only thing plausible.

304
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:40,696
But, if so...

305
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:43,996
The deduction that Mannen killed Iwabuchi

306
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:46,396
to take everything for the himself wouldn't hold ground.

307
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:49,296
Sadao Mannen has no motive.

308
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:52,096
If so, who took Osamu Iwabuchi's life?

309
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,496
I see!

310
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:02,596
Hey, hey.

311
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,896
Mr. Mannen is a mysterious person, isn't he?

312
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,896
He didn't look for the money until he found it.

313
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:10,596
I wonder why he stopped partway?

314
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,096
Did he stop partway?

315
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:17,796
He moved the flying saucer out at 01:00, you know.

316
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:19,096
That's right.

317
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:20,496
Maybe something that made him have to

318
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,696
stop looking for the treasure happened?

319
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:25,996
An unforeseeable occurrence, did you call it?

320
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,596
An unforeseeable occurrence?

321
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:30,896
I wonder if that had anything to do with the wire

322
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:34,096
that was holding the UFO up on the ceiling breaking or something?

323
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:35,896
The wire that it was suspended by?

324
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,896
It was broken. Only the one that was rusty was?

325
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:41,396
Besides, Mr. Iwabuchi was crushed

326
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:44,796
by that flying saucer twice, wasn't he?

327
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,796
He died from the first crush

328
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:48,596
and was crushed once again after that, right?

329
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,196
An unforeseeable occurrence...

330
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:52,096
The wire that broke off...

331
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,896
Crushed twice...

332
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:58,496
And Sadao Mannen has no motive to kill Osamu Iwabuchi.

333
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,096
Right.

334
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:03,496
Most probably.

335
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:07,496
I see. This was not a homicide.

336
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:08,696
Yes.

337
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:11,796
Hey. Why isn't it a homicide?

338
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,296
I don't know.

339
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,096
The only thing I do know is that

340
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:17,896
the treasure is still hidden in that lab.

341
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:21,296
At any rate, let's go back to that lab.

342
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,596
Hey. You children should all go home.

343
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:24,796
But...

344
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:28,196
We left our things there.

345
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,496
Is that so?

346
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:33,396
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

347
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,996
How many trunks do you need to fill billions of yen?

348
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:38,296
It may not be cash.

349
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:39,996
It could be sticks of gold!

350
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:42,596
I don't mind you looking for it at all.

351
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,496
But when on earth did he hide it?

352
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,396
Mr. Okura never once came here, and yet...

353
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,196
What?

354
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,896
He never came?

355
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,396
But he came to sell the hanging scroll, didn't he?

356
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:56,696
No. He contacted me

357
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:59,796
and I went over to his place.

358
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:03,096
I heard rumors that you are developing flying saucers,

359
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,696
so I thought that the Heavens would punish me

360
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,396
if I didn't give this to you, Doctor.

361
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:12,996
It's as if it's been drawn just for me.

362
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:14,296
You think so too, don't you?

363
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,096
Please keep is as a household treasure.

364
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,196
50,000 yen will do!

365
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:22,096
And that's how I got a hold of this.

366
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:24,596
Kinji Okura didn't come here?

367
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:27,896
If not, he couldn't have hidden any treasure here, could he?

368
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:32,196
So that last word, "UFO" that Mr. Okura mentioned

369
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,096
was not about this place.

370
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,696
The odd couple mistakenly thought

371
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,396
that was what he meant and snuck in here.

372
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:42,596
If so, then why did Kinji Okura sell it?

373
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:45,096
To the point of calling him over,

374
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:46,896
for something like that...

375
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,496
So, that's the story.

376
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:55,896
It seems you've come up with something, haven't you?

377
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,396
Well, either way, that person Mannen

378
00:18:58,396 --> 00:18:59,996
is probably going to come here tonight again

379
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:02,296
to look for the treasure, though.

380
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:03,796
No.

381
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:06,096
I don't think he'll be able to wait till tonight.

382
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:13,196
I've got to give it back quickly

383
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:16,096
or I'll be in hot water.

384
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:18,696
Not home. Lucky!

385
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,996
Mr. Sadao Mannen?

386
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,296
You also snuck in here last night too, didn't you?

387
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:29,596
Together with your "kid brother" Iwabuchi

388
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:33,196
to look for Kinji Okura's hidden assets.

389
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:37,896
But some unforeseeable accident happened.

390
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:39,996
Yeah.

391
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:42,596
I'm sure it's here somewhere!

392
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:46,196
Because this is the only place with a UFO.

393
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:53,596
My only good suit...

394
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:54,996
Who cares! If we get hold of the money,

395
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:56,796
you can buy as much of that stuff as you want!

396
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,596
True, I guess so.

397
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:05,296
What?

398
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:06,896
Buchi?

399
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:08,496
Are you all right, Buchi?

400
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:10,096
Buchi!

401
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:15,996
He was completely crushed and died on the spot.

402
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,696
I knew it was rusty.

403
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,296
And I was going to buy a new one

404
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:22,896
after I got paid for my part-time job.

405
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:25,396
It was an accident, wasn't it?

406
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:28,796
You couldn't make yourself continue looking for the treasure.

407
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:32,796
You couldn't leave the corpse as it was either.

408
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,896
Because if the corpse is found in the morning,

409
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,896
the police would rush over here.

410
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:38,896
If Iwabuchi is found dead,

411
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:40,996
you, as his "big brother" would also

412
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:43,596
be suspected as having been together.

413
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:47,996
Besides, if the police find the treasure during site investigation,

414
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,696
everything would go down the drain.

415
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,896
In order for this not to happen, you devised a plan.

416
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:55,696
By moving both the corpse and the flying saucer using the truck,

417
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:57,796
you tried to make it look as if

418
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,796
Mr. Iwabuchi died at that dry riverbed

419
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:04,596
to keep the eyes of the police away from this lab.

420
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,696
I was hoping that the crash landing of the UFO

421
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:10,196
would be thought the reason of his death.

422
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:12,296
But if you wanted to distract the eyes of the police,

423
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,796
there are other easy ways to do so, aren't there?

424
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:16,596
All you had to do was hide the corpse

425
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,296
where people wouldn't find it.

426
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:20,696
-I see. -If the corpse isn't found,

427
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,396
the police won't make any moves.

428
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:24,496
That won't do!

429
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:30,596
If he's not found, I can't give him a funeral, can I?

430
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:33,296
That would be too pathetic for Buchi.

431
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:38,196
But you understand, don't you?

432
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,296
You've committed several crimes.

433
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:46,196
Trespassing into this lab, dump job,

434
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:49,096
and stealing the UFO, a burglary charge.

435
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:53,896
I admit everything.

436
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:57,596
-Let's go. -Yes, sir.

437
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,896
That's right.

438
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:01,096
As for Mr. Okura's hidden asset,

439
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:05,096
there were jewels hidden in the shaft of the hanging scroll.

440
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:08,396
Mr. Okura's final word did not indicate the location,

441
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,596
but the UFO hanging scroll itself.

442
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,996
Now, I'll take you all home,

443
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,396
so go get your things.

444
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,896
-Huh? -What things?

445
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:49,896
We forgot to do our homework!

446
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:54,096
"Next Episode" -Is it buried treasure?

447
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:04,196
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

448
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:09,896
This is...

449
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,696
a pass ring for the mystery train.

450
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:22,096
Next Conan, "Shadow Closes in on Ai's Secret (Part 1)"

451
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,596
Next Conan's Hint:

452
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:42,196
"Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano"

453
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,496
Hey, are you going to do it again?

454
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:44,696
I can't help it, can't I?

455
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:47,096
Well, I guess, you mean like this?
