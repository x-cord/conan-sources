Side!

5
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.470
Yes!

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
Winner!

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.370
Red, Heiji Hattori of Kaiho Academy!

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.070
Hattori's in the finals now.

9
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.970
Yeah. Since only Heiji won

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.770
in yesterday's semifinal team match,

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470
they didn't make it.

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.170
But it seems like he should be able to win today's individual match.

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.370
Yeah.

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670
As long as he's not here.

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.270
Who do you mean?

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.770
The boy he'll probably face in the finals.

17
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.970
Kyoto Senshin High School's...

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.770
Soshi Okita.

19
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.870
Heiji's lost to that five-level strike before.

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.970
He's strong.

21
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.770
What? Five levels?

22
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.170
It only looked like one strike to me.

23
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.170
His opponent's being carried away on a stretcher.

24
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.770
You just watch, Okita.

25
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.870
Today I'll settle the score between us...

26
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.970
and tell Kazuha.

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.270
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

29
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.870
Heiji's rival Okita appears.

30
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.170
What will Heiji tell Kazuha?

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.670
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33

36
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:59.827
Thanks for coming today, Ran, to cheer him on.

37
00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:02.827
No problem. It's Sunday. I didn't have anything else to do.

38
00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:07.427
The semifinal and final matches will begin

39
00:04:07.427 --> 00:04:10.027
after lunch at 2 pm.

40
00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:13.427
2 pm? That's two hours from now.

41
00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:17.227
I'm going to get lunch with my friends.

42
00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:20.327
You guys should get something to eat, too.

43
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.427
Okay.

44
00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:24.827
What do you want to eat, Conan?

45
00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:28.427
We can go to one of the fast food places we saw on the way here.

46
00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:31.527
Should we go to the bathroom first?

47
00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:32.627
Yeah.

48
00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:37.227
No way.

49
00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:39.327
The men's and women's bathrooms are crowded.

50
00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:41.427
We won't be able to get in for a while.

51
00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:42.827
Excuse me.

52
00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:45.827
Do you know where the other bathrooms are?

53
00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.427
The bathroom outside the north entrance

54
00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:51.227
should be less crowded.

55
00:04:51.227 --> 00:04:53.527
Thank you.

Kudo, want to get lunch?

58
00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:02.327
Focus on your match.

59
00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:03.927
Who texted you?

60
00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:05.927
Dr. Agasa.

61
00:05:08.427 --> 00:05:10.027
Iori?

62
00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:13.927
Have the preparations for Heiji's victory party been made?

63
00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:17.627
Yes, on the top floor of the Teito Hotel.

64
00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:21.527
It's a surprise. Don't let Heiji find out.

65
00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:23.627
I know.

66
00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:29.727
So, do you think Heiji will win?

67
00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:32.327
I believe he'll make it to the finals,

68
00:05:32.327 --> 00:05:34.727
but winning may be a bit difficult.

69
00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:39.027
You mean my classmate, Okita?

70
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:41.227
Do we need to do something about him?

71
00:05:41.227 --> 00:05:44.327
No. He's one obstacle,

72
00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:49.827
but there's another very strong student in the tournament.

73
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:53.227
Really? I'm excited.

74
00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:56.327
I'll be arriving soon.

75
00:05:56.327 --> 00:05:59.227
Come meet me when I arrive.

76
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:02.027
Yes, Ms. Momiji.

77
00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:08.627
"Shido Nukitani (43)"

78
00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:13.227
You're a Kyoto Senshin student?

79
00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:17.727
If you're planning to practice here before your match, don't.

80
00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:20.727
You'll damage the grass.

81
00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:23.127
You'll get in trouble with the groundskeeper.

82
00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:38.227
Excuse me.

83
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:47.127
I thought I heard a groan.

84
00:06:50.227 --> 00:06:53.727
Excuse me. Did something happen?

85
00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:58.127
Excuse me.

86
00:07:05.827 --> 00:07:07.927
Where's the bathroom?

87
00:07:10.027 --> 00:07:11.227
There it is.

88
00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:16.227
Are you all right? Hang in there!

89
00:07:18.027 --> 00:07:19.227
It's no use.

90
00:07:19.227 --> 00:07:21.527
He's already dead.

91
00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:23.027
But...

92
00:07:23.027 --> 00:07:25.927
His body's not that cold yet.

93
00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:28.127
The killer might be nearby.

94
00:07:28.127 --> 00:07:29.527
What?

95
00:07:29.527 --> 00:07:33.527
We didn't pass anyone on the way here, right?

96
00:07:33.527 --> 00:07:34.627
No.

97
00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:36.727
Excuse me.

98
00:07:36.727 --> 00:07:39.527
Did something happen after all?

99
00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:41.727
"Did something happen"?

100
00:07:44.427 --> 00:07:48.427
Mister, are you blind?

101
00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:51.527
Yes, since three years ago.

102
00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:55.727
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:55.727 --> 00:07:59.127
I was listening to the sounds of the kendo tournament.

104
00:07:59.127 --> 00:08:00.427
The sounds?

105
00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:02.627
The sound of feet striking the floor.

106
00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.327
The sound of bamboo swords clashing.

107
00:08:05.327 --> 00:08:07.927
The shrill vocalizations of the combatants.

108
00:08:07.927 --> 00:08:11.227
I was listening to the sounds that can be heard out here

109
00:08:11.227 --> 00:08:14.127
and thinking about the past.

110
00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:18.127
I used to practice kendo when I was young, too.

111
00:08:18.127 --> 00:08:22.127
Until four years ago, I used to watch from the stands,

112
00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.327
but since I lost my sight,

113
00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:30.127
I started listening to the tournaments alone here.

114
00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:33.227
So, did something happen to someone?

115
00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:36.427
A man's throat was cut. He's dead.

116
00:08:36.427 --> 00:08:38.327
What?

117
00:08:38.327 --> 00:08:43.327
Then the person who approached me after I heard a groan

118
00:08:43.327 --> 00:08:45.827
must've been the killer.

119
00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:48.827
Did they ignore him because he's blind?

120
00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:53.427
By the way, the killer said something.

121
00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:57.927
"This box cutter is bloody and useless."

122
00:08:57.927 --> 00:09:02.127
"Bring me another one."

123
00:09:02.127 --> 00:09:05.027
You heard the killer's voice?

124
00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:09.527
Yes. I didn't hear the voice of the person they were speaking to,

125
00:09:09.527 --> 00:09:13.127
so they were probably on the phone with someone.

126
00:09:13.127 --> 00:09:16.627
Do you know which way the killer went

127
00:09:16.627 --> 00:09:18.527
after they approached you?

128
00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:20.927
Yes, that way.

129
00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:23.827
Towards that bathroom.

130
00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:27.227
Did anyone walk past you after that?

131
00:09:27.227 --> 00:09:30.427
Yes, about two people.

132
00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:32.627
I thought they went to the bathroom,

133
00:09:32.627 --> 00:09:37.227
but after that, I don't think anyone exited the bathroom

134
00:09:37.227 --> 00:09:40.327
and walked past me.

135
00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:42.227
Then the killer...

136
00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:45.827
is still inside that bathroom?

137
00:09:45.827 --> 00:09:47.827
Okay.

138
00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:50.527
Don't, Ran!

139
00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:54.427
The killer told their accomplice to bring them a new blade.

140
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.227
It sounds like they still have another target.

141
00:09:57.227 --> 00:10:01.027
It's better for us to call the police and keep watch here.

142
00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:03.527
I see. You're right.

143
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:14.927
There isn't a single defensive wound.

144
00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:17.527
-Officer Takagi? There's a dead man -Was he killed by someone he knew?

145
00:10:17.527 --> 00:10:20.127
next to the bathroom at the Toto Gymnasium.

146
00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:24.327
You already sniffed out the murder, Hattori?

147
00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:25.627
Huh?

148
00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:28.427
It's like they were breaking in a new sword.

149
00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:33.027
Furthermore, this looks like the work of a rather skilled swordsman.

150
00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:34.627
Who are you?

151
00:10:34.627 --> 00:10:36.527
Who? Me?

152
00:10:36.527 --> 00:10:39.427
I'm Kyoto Senshin High School student,

153
00:10:39.427 --> 00:10:41.927
Soshi Okita.

154
00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:43.027
What?

155
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.727
Okita?

156
00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:50.527
Perhaps you're the five-level striker Kazuha mentioned earlier?

157
00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:57.427
You're really cute.

158
00:10:57.427 --> 00:10:59.227
What's your name?

159
00:10:59.227 --> 00:11:02.227
Ran Mouri.

160
00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:05.427
Ran? That's a nice name.

161
00:11:05.427 --> 00:11:08.827
I live in Kyoto's Kamigyo Ward.

162
00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:12.627
Let me know if you ever come to Kyoto.

163
00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:14.827
I'll show you around.

164
00:11:14.827 --> 00:11:17.127
Who is this guy?

165
00:11:17.127 --> 00:11:20.927
He's exactly like Shinichi.

166
00:11:25.527 --> 00:11:27.327
You said the person who attacked this man

167
00:11:27.327 --> 00:11:29.927
might be a skilled swordsman.

168
00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:31.227
How can you tell?

169
00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:33.327
You mean you can't?

170
00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:36.927
It certainly looks like he was cut down by a single blow.

171
00:11:36.927 --> 00:11:38.027
No...

172
00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:39.727
It's his clothes.

173
00:11:39.727 --> 00:11:41.627
-His clothes? -Yeah.

174
00:11:41.627 --> 00:11:46.127
Navy blazer, gray pants, dark red necktie.

175
00:11:46.127 --> 00:11:49.127
He's a kendo referee.

176
00:11:49.127 --> 00:11:50.427
I see!

177
00:11:50.427 --> 00:11:53.127
If he's a referee, he must be ranked.

178
00:11:53.127 --> 00:11:56.127
I figured the killer must be pretty skilled

179
00:11:56.127 --> 00:11:59.927
to kill a man like that with a single blow.

180
00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:03.927
He really is just like Shinichi.

181
00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:08.727
What? Have you fallen in love with me?

182
00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.027
No.

183
00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:12.427
Don't underestimate a samurai.

184
00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:16.327
I can sense it.

185
00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:36.094
No one can sense that, idiot!

186
00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:38.094
Hattori.

187
00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.694
And that's my friend's girl.

188
00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:42.994
Stay away from her.

189
00:12:42.994 --> 00:12:46.594
Who cares? I haven't seen him around.

190
00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:48.994
You sure have. Is there a problem?

191
00:12:48.994 --> 00:12:51.694
Anyway, I just came to get some practice swings in

192
00:12:51.694 --> 00:12:55.094
before my match against you.

193
00:12:55.094 --> 00:12:56.794
I wasn't expecting you to be here,

194
00:12:56.794 --> 00:12:59.394
much less caught up in a murder.

195
00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:02.194
You came to do some practice swings, too?

196
00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:04.494
Oh? Too?

197
00:13:04.494 --> 00:13:07.594
Does that mean I'm on your radar?

198
00:13:07.594 --> 00:13:13.294
Nah. There's one other fighter I might lose to.

199
00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:19.894
It sounds like the police are here.

200
00:13:19.894 --> 00:13:21.694
Who's the old man?

201
00:13:21.694 --> 00:13:24.194
Oh, he's...

202
00:13:25.994 --> 00:13:28.894
What? You heard the killer's voice?

203
00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:30.594
Is that true, sir?

204
00:13:30.594 --> 00:13:32.394
Probably.

205
00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:35.594
They called someone on the phone and said the following,

206
00:13:35.594 --> 00:13:39.094
"Katsunari Yasuoka (78)" -"This box cutter is bloody and useless."

207
00:13:39.094 --> 00:13:42.694
"Bring me another one."

208
00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:45.194
They said a bunch of other things,

209
00:13:45.194 --> 00:13:46.994
but since they were speaking quietly,

210
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.794
I couldn't hear them.

211
00:13:49.794 --> 00:13:51.794
According to you,

212
00:13:51.794 --> 00:13:54.894
after killing the victim, they headed to the bathroom.

213
00:13:54.894 --> 00:13:58.894
Later, about two people passed by you

214
00:13:58.894 --> 00:14:01.194
and also headed to the bathroom.

215
00:14:01.194 --> 00:14:04.494
But by the time Ran and Conan came here and discovered the body,

216
00:14:04.494 --> 00:14:07.394
no one's left the bathroom.

217
00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:09.394
They must still be inside.

218
00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:10.594
Yes.

219
00:14:10.594 --> 00:14:13.094
Inside that bathroom...

220
00:14:13.094 --> 00:14:15.094
is the murderer.

221
00:14:15.094 --> 00:14:16.894
I'll check the women's room.

222
00:14:16.894 --> 00:14:18.494
Officer Takagi, check the men's room.

223
00:14:18.494 --> 00:14:19.794
Got it.

224
00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.494
Be careful.

225
00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:25.794
The killer could still have a box cutter.

226
00:14:25.794 --> 00:14:27.394
Okay.

227
00:14:27.394 --> 00:14:30.794
It should be obvious who the killer is.

228
00:14:30.794 --> 00:14:33.294
They'll be covered in blood.

229
00:14:36.594 --> 00:14:38.494
"Nenji Norimura (40)" -What's going on?

230
00:14:38.494 --> 00:14:40.794
"Tsuneyuki Yokote (28)" -The bathroom's available.

231
00:14:40.794 --> 00:14:42.994
"Akane Sadamori (31)" -The toilet paper's almost out.

232
00:14:42.994 --> 00:14:44.894
Be careful.

233
00:14:46.694 --> 00:14:48.494
None of them...

234
00:14:48.494 --> 00:14:49.994
Have blood on them?

235
00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:54.794
Did something happen?

236
00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.094
What?

237
00:14:57.094 --> 00:14:59.194
Mr. Nukitani?

238
00:14:59.194 --> 00:15:00.394
Mr. Nukitani!

239
00:15:01.594 --> 00:15:03.194
Hold on.

240
00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.794
That outfit. You're a referee, too.

241
00:15:06.794 --> 00:15:09.094
In other words, you're ranked.

242
00:15:09.094 --> 00:15:11.894
You sure you didn't kill him?

243
00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:15.594
Kill him? Mr. Nukitani's dead?

244
00:15:15.594 --> 00:15:18.294
Yeah. Sliced his neck right open.

245
00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:19.794
It wasn't me.

246
00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:24.894
But it's true that you knew each other.

247
00:15:24.894 --> 00:15:27.994
Yeah. We're both referees.

248
00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:31.094
And we frequently faced each other in tournaments.

249
00:15:31.094 --> 00:15:35.194
But I'd never beaten Mr. Nukitani.

250
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:39.594
You didn't kill him because you couldn't win, did you?

251
00:15:39.594 --> 00:15:41.794
Of course not.

252
00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:44.994
I've never seen that man before.

253
00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:46.294
Me, neither.

254
00:15:46.294 --> 00:15:52.994
But there was a photo of you with this man on his phone.

255
00:15:54.094 --> 00:15:55.594
Right, mister?

256
00:15:55.594 --> 00:15:56.894
Yeah.

257
00:15:58.294 --> 00:15:59.394
See?

258
00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:02.794
That's...

259
00:16:02.794 --> 00:16:05.994
Come to think of it, Mr. Nukitani often mentioned...

260
00:16:05.994 --> 00:16:06.994
What?

261
00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:08.894
That he was being hit on by a student

262
00:16:08.894 --> 00:16:12.294
who was a former Self-Defense Force official.

263
00:16:12.294 --> 00:16:13.694
A student?

264
00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:16.594
Does that mean you used to practice kendo, too?

265
00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:20.094
Yeah, just for three years in high school.

266
00:16:20.094 --> 00:16:24.594
Mr. Nukitani was the gym teacher and adviser of the kendo club.

267
00:16:24.594 --> 00:16:27.194
Then why did you say you don't know him?

268
00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:30.794
Because I don't want to get involved in the case, obviously.

269
00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:32.794
By the time I walked past here,

270
00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:36.594
Mr. Nukitani was already bleeding from his neck and dead.

271
00:16:36.594 --> 00:16:41.294
Why didn't you report it to the police?

272
00:16:41.294 --> 00:16:45.094
I had a lot going on. I was shaken up.

273
00:16:45.094 --> 00:16:47.794
How about when you came to the bathroom?

274
00:16:47.794 --> 00:16:51.294
I'm not sure. I didn't have time to use the bathroom this morning,

275
00:16:51.294 --> 00:16:53.094
so I was in a hurry.

276
00:16:53.094 --> 00:16:57.494
It's possible I didn't notice Mr. Nukitani.

277
00:16:57.494 --> 00:17:00.394
How about when you came?

278
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.994
I was in a hurry because I was about to wet myself, too.

279
00:17:03.994 --> 00:17:06.894
But I've never seen that man

280
00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:08.394
and I've never done kendo before.

281
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:09.794
I've got nothing to do with this case.

282
00:17:09.794 --> 00:17:11.694
You're lying.

283
00:17:11.694 --> 00:17:15.594
I saw you bragging to your lady friend

284
00:17:15.594 --> 00:17:16.994
while you were having tea

285
00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.894
at a cafe in Beika City with Mr. Nukitani.

286
00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:23.594
You said, "I once won a kendo tournament."

287
00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:25.694
You said, "I wish I could've shown you

288
00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:28.994
the victory pose I struck after I won."

289
00:17:28.994 --> 00:17:33.194
You were arguing with Mr. Nukitani who was sitting next to you.

290
00:17:33.194 --> 00:17:36.494
He asked you which tournament that was.

291
00:17:36.494 --> 00:17:40.694
And I remember how the woman with you left you there

292
00:17:40.694 --> 00:17:42.994
with a disgusted look on her face.

293
00:17:42.994 --> 00:17:46.194
Well, you were arguing with him, too.

294
00:17:46.194 --> 00:17:47.794
You said you'd kill yourself or someone else

295
00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:50.294
if he didn't leave his wife.

296
00:17:51.794 --> 00:17:54.794
Not to mention that referee

297
00:17:54.794 --> 00:17:58.894
was arguing with Mr. Nukitani

298
00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:00.694
after yesterday's final team match.

299
00:18:00.694 --> 00:18:03.194
Oh, that?

300
00:18:03.194 --> 00:18:06.694
When I said his refereeing had been a little lax lately,

301
00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:09.694
he said to hold my complaints until after I'd beaten him.

302
00:18:09.694 --> 00:18:11.894
It made me angry.

303
00:18:11.894 --> 00:18:17.794
In other words, you all had a motive to kill Nukitani.

304
00:18:19.894 --> 00:18:21.794
Excuse me.

305
00:18:21.794 --> 00:18:26.894
Can't we determine the killer by asking this old man?

306
00:18:26.894 --> 00:18:29.894
He heard the killer's voice.

307
00:18:29.894 --> 00:18:32.194
Right, sir?

308
00:18:34.694 --> 00:18:36.794
Well, actually...

309
00:18:38.294 --> 00:18:40.794
None of them are it.

310
00:18:40.794 --> 00:18:41.994
What?

311
00:18:41.994 --> 00:18:46.794
I heard the hoarse voice of a man.

312
00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:48.294
Hoarse voice?

313
00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:51.394
Could it have been Mr. Nukitani's voice?

314
00:18:53.594 --> 00:18:55.794
It was the victim's voice?

315
00:18:55.794 --> 00:19:01.294
You heard the request for a new box cutter before a groan?

316
00:19:01.294 --> 00:19:02.394
Yes.

317
00:19:02.394 --> 00:19:07.194
Then the person who brought the box cutter killed him?

318
00:19:07.194 --> 00:19:09.094
Well...

319
00:19:09.094 --> 00:19:12.194
Who's the last person in the victim's call history?

320
00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:14.594
The victim's wife.

321
00:19:14.594 --> 00:19:17.294
She's on her way here now.

322
00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:18.894
What's going on?

323
00:19:18.894 --> 00:19:25.194
It's possible the killer erased themselves from his call history.

324
00:19:25.194 --> 00:19:27.494
It's crazy back here.

325
00:19:27.494 --> 00:19:28.594
-What? -What?

326
00:19:28.594 --> 00:19:29.794
Behind the bathroom.

327
00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:30.894
Come check it out.

328
00:19:33.194 --> 00:19:36.194
There's a bloody uniform and armor back here.

329
00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:40.394
Maybe the killer was wearing them when they killed Mr. Nukitani.

330
00:19:40.394 --> 00:19:44.194
They're right between the men's and women's bathrooms.

331
00:19:44.194 --> 00:19:48.394
Isn't that a set of Kyoto Senshin High School armor?

332
00:19:48.394 --> 00:19:51.894
Come to think of it, after yesterday's team match,

333
00:19:51.894 --> 00:19:57.494
a first-year said our spare armor and uniform were missing.

334
00:19:57.494 --> 00:20:01.194
A spare set? Then it must've been worn by a bunch of guys.

335
00:20:01.194 --> 00:20:04.494
I wore that yesterday.

336
00:20:05.594 --> 00:20:09.194
I was asked to practice with someone before their match.

337
00:20:09.194 --> 00:20:12.194
Then you must've met Okita then.

338
00:20:12.194 --> 00:20:14.794
I did skip practice.

339
00:20:14.794 --> 00:20:18.094
If it was worn by multiple people,

340
00:20:18.094 --> 00:20:19.694
then it'll be difficult

341
00:20:19.694 --> 00:20:22.594
to determine the killer's identity using DNA.

342
00:20:22.594 --> 00:20:25.894
Yeah. Since the uniform can be worn over your clothes,

343
00:20:25.894 --> 00:20:27.694
we can't expect much.

344
00:20:27.694 --> 00:20:28.694
In any case,

345
00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:31.994
tell the tournament organizer to put the matches on hold.

346
00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:33.994
There's been a murder.

347
00:20:33.994 --> 00:20:35.594
Got it.

348
00:20:35.594 --> 00:20:38.494
Hold on! You can't stop the tournament!

349
00:20:38.494 --> 00:20:40.794
What? Why not?

350
00:20:40.794 --> 00:20:43.294
Because, well...

351
00:20:43.294 --> 00:20:45.494
Could it be?

352
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.094
I...

353
00:20:48.094 --> 00:20:49.994
There's something I've got to say to her

354
00:20:49.994 --> 00:20:52.594
after I win this tournament!

355
00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:56.994
-Huh? -What?

356
00:20:59.194 --> 00:21:01.794
We've got 40 minutes before the matches start.

357
00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:04.494
We just need to solve the case before then, right?

358
00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:06.794
But...

359
00:21:06.794 --> 00:21:09.194
In any case, you can't stop the tournament.

360
00:21:09.194 --> 00:21:11.294
Hattori.

361
00:21:11.294 --> 00:21:13.994
Maybe I misheard you,

362
00:21:13.994 --> 00:21:18.694
but did you just say something about winning the tournament?

363
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.394
I sure did. What about it?

364
00:21:20.394 --> 00:21:23.894
I see. Which means...

365
00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:28.094
you think you'll beat me?

366
00:21:28.094 --> 00:21:30.094
Of course, idiot!

367
00:21:30.094 --> 00:21:33.194
Then we don't need to wait until the match.

368
00:21:34.594 --> 00:21:37.394
Why don't we settle this here?

369
00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:42.194
I'd love to, cuckoo of Mt. Arigata.

370
00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:57.594
Wait a minute.

371
00:21:57.594 --> 00:22:01.194
He means Kazuha, doesn't he?

372
00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:05.494
That means if Hattori wins this tournament...

373
00:22:06.594 --> 00:22:09.394
he's going to confess his feelings to Kazuha?

374
00:22:15.194 --> 00:22:17.794
Ran sure is taking a long time.

375
00:22:17.794 --> 00:22:20.994
If they don't hurry, the matches will start.

376
00:22:23.394 --> 00:22:27.194
That's delicious. Fragrant, too.

377
00:22:27.194 --> 00:22:30.194
Your tea is always fantastic, Iori.

378
00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:32.794
Thank you, miss.

379
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.794
"Next Episode" -Now that I've caught you...

380
00:23:58.694 --> 00:24:00.794
you're not getting away.

381
00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:04.394
No. It is me who has come to find you.

382
00:24:04.394 --> 00:24:05.894
"Onimaru"

383
00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:08.594
This name...

384
00:24:09.794 --> 00:24:11.794
Cutter?

385
00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:13.694
What about a change of clothes?

386
00:24:13.694 --> 00:24:15.194
Sorry, Kudo.

387
00:24:15.194 --> 00:24:17.894
This case is mine.

388
00:24:18.794 --> 00:24:24.378
Next Conan, "Kendo Tournament of Love and Mystery (Part 2)"

389
00:24:24.737 --> 00:24:27.337
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:27.337 --> 00:24:29.337
"Bamboo sword"

391
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:31.437
-Nice to meet you. -You, too.

392
00:24:31.437 --> 00:24:32.837
Win and confess your feelings!

393
00:24:32.837 --> 00:24:34.137
What about the case?
