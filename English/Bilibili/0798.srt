1
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.740
Shoots. It's already this late.

2
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.440
Shoots!

3
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.640
He's not aware.

4
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.740
Please make it!

5
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.640
What the?

6
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.240
What happened?

7
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.640
Are you... all right?

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.240
-What? -I'm sure glad you're okay.

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.440
You were about to be crushed

10
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.540
by that man who came falling from the roof, you know.

11
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.940
What?

12
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.140
This man seems to be okay, too.

13
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.240
That man called Mr. Sadao Fukurokoji.

14
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.340
I wonder why he fell?

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.740
What?

16
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.840
I think he tried to commit suicide.

17
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.940
Suicide?

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.540
He used to always say so at the pub.

19
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.340
Nothing ever works out for me.

20
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.940
I wanna hurry up and die.

21
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.940
Like so.

22
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.540
I was going to be messed up in a suicide case.

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.040
Bad luck used to follow me around from before.

24
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.840
Some people are like that, I guess.

25
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.940
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.140
Love and cases come from the same origin.

27
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.040
Waiting to meet someone for a casual date.

28
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.940
The slightest difference determines destiny.

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.540
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:37.703
"The Moving Target"

33
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.203
It's an alleged suicide case.

34
00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:48.903
So it's of no concern to the Detective Squad, right?

35
00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:52.803
We'd like to go see the site, anyway.

36
00:03:52.803 --> 00:03:55.603
After all, it happened on our turf.

37
00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.003
Right!

38
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:00.503
It's up ahead.

39
00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:03.803
What?

40
00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:05.603
Why is the investigation 1st division here?

41
00:04:07.303 --> 00:04:08.703
It's that boy!

42
00:04:08.703 --> 00:04:12.303
By the boy wearing glasses, you meant Conan after all.

43
00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:13.803
Great timing.

44
00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:15.803
I have something I'd like to ask you about last night.

45
00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:18.303
So it wasn't a mere case of alleged suicide.

46
00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:22.303
No. It was a holiday so all the doors were closed.

47
00:04:22.903 --> 00:04:24.303
So, the only way to get up to the roof

48
00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:27.203
was to use the emergency stairs.

49
00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:28.303
But...

50
00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:32.303
Mr. Fukurokoji was so wasted, he couldn't stand on his own.

51
00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:34.603
He couldn't have possibly gone up the stairs then.

52
00:04:34.603 --> 00:04:36.403
No, he couldn't have.

53
00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:39.503
Somebody carried Mr. Fukurokoji who was wasted

54
00:04:39.503 --> 00:04:43.503
up the stairs to the roof and pushed him over.

55
00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:44.903
So...

56
00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:48.903
It wasn't alleged suicide but homicide.

57
00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:51.803
And the perp is thought to have run

58
00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:55.003
into the crowd of spectators and fled, but...

59
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.903
I wonder if you witnessed any suspicious looking person?

60
00:05:00.503 --> 00:05:01.803
I see.

61
00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:03.903
May I go see the roof?

62
00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.203
I may recall something.

63
00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:10.503
It was from here, right?

64
00:05:10.503 --> 00:05:12.403
We're right above.

65
00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:14.603
There are traces of the railing have been wiped, too.

66
00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:17.203
What? What do you mean?

67
00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:21.203
That. It looks like the fence has been wiped clean, doesn't it?

68
00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.703
Mr. Fukurokoji's clothes must've rubbed against it

69
00:05:23.703 --> 00:05:25.503
when he was pushed over, right?

70
00:05:25.503 --> 00:05:29.203
But why did the perp do something so troublesome

71
00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:31.003
as to carry him up to the roof and drop him?

72
00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:33.603
He tried to make it look like suicide, no?

73
00:05:33.603 --> 00:05:37.003
If so, there are easier ways to do it, aren't there?

74
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.303
There are traces here, too.

75
00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:45.603
Which means the perp initially was going to push him off from here.

76
00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:48.703
But, because Mr. Fukurokoji resisted,

77
00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:51.803
he consequently pushed him off from there.

78
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:55.803
I wonder if somebody so wasted could resist.

79
00:05:57.503 --> 00:05:58.703
Inspector!

80
00:06:01.003 --> 00:06:03.603
Mr. Fukurokoji says he was so wasted last night

81
00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:05.803
that he doesn't remember a thing.

82
00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:09.803
He also said that he's loser in a competitive society,

83
00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.403
so he knows of no one who has a grudge against him.

84
00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:16.803
However, it's a fact that he was almost killed.

85
00:06:16.803 --> 00:06:20.703
We'll try and get clues on where Mr. Fukurokoji went last night.

86
00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:24.803
The perp is sure to have made contact with him somewhere.

87
00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:26.003
Yes, sir!

88
00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:30.303
You don't seem convinced.

89
00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:33.503
Yeah, something's...

90
00:06:33.503 --> 00:06:34.503
That's him.

91
00:06:37.403 --> 00:06:39.803
Oh, it's over here.

92
00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:41.903
Here, over here.

93
00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:45.803
This is where I was about to get crushed.

94
00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:48.003
I got it.

95
00:06:48.003 --> 00:06:50.303
I understand that you're unlucky.

96
00:06:50.303 --> 00:06:54.203
Were you telling your friend about how unlucky you are?

97
00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:55.803
You're yesterday's...

98
00:06:55.803 --> 00:06:58.103
He's Daisuke Yukigaya,

99
00:06:58.103 --> 00:07:00.703
my friend that I'm really proud of.

100
00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:03.203
No need to say such things to children.

101
00:07:03.203 --> 00:07:05.703
I'll see you.

102
00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:07.103
Bye.

103
00:07:08.403 --> 00:07:12.403
He said he came nearby. So he came to visit me.

104
00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:14.203
He's an efficient worker.

105
00:07:14.203 --> 00:07:17.803
He's an athlete and is from a rich distinguished family.

106
00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.103
He's confident in everything he does.

107
00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:21.503
He entered the company at the same time I did,

108
00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:23.803
but is very different from me.

109
00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:27.803
He says he never experienced any type of failure up to this day.

110
00:07:28.603 --> 00:07:32.003
Such perfect people exist.

111
00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:35.203
I wonder about people who know no failure?

112
00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:39.003
I guess it's okay if they can go through life that way forever.

113
00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:42.203
Compared to him, I'm super unlucky, you see.

114
00:07:42.203 --> 00:07:46.103
Last night too, only because you happened to pass by here.

115
00:07:46.103 --> 00:07:48.103
I didn't just happen to pass by.

116
00:07:48.103 --> 00:07:50.203
I was waiting for somebody.

117
00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:53.103
I got a love letter from a woman I never met.

118
00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.703
But maybe because there was such a fuss,

119
00:07:57.703 --> 00:08:01.003
that person never came.

120
00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:03.603
A person you don't know asked you to meet her?

121
00:08:03.603 --> 00:08:06.703
She wrote to come in front of this building at 8:00.

122
00:08:06.703 --> 00:08:09.903
So at first, I was waiting in front of the entrance.

123
00:08:09.903 --> 00:08:12.303
But my wristwatch stopped.

124
00:08:14.803 --> 00:08:16.703
The battery's dead?

125
00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:19.003
What time is it now anyway?

126
00:08:19.003 --> 00:08:22.003
I'm sure there was a clock over that side.

127
00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:24.303
The time, the time.

128
00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:28.303
I came here where I could see the clock,

129
00:08:28.303 --> 00:08:30.503
that person came falling.

130
00:08:30.503 --> 00:08:32.803
I'm really unlucky, don't you think?

131
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:43.203
First, over here.

132
00:08:43.203 --> 00:08:45.903
The other place where the railing was wiped clean.

133
00:08:45.903 --> 00:08:48.503
What's the matter, Conan?

134
00:08:48.503 --> 00:08:51.203
Officer Takagi said that Mr. Fukurokoji resisted,

135
00:08:51.203 --> 00:08:53.503
so the initial place where the perp wanted to push him over

136
00:08:53.503 --> 00:08:57.503
was different from the actual place he was pushed over.

137
00:08:58.403 --> 00:08:59.703
But there's another reason for it.

138
00:08:59.703 --> 00:09:01.403
-What? -What is it?

139
00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:02.703
What?

140
00:09:02.703 --> 00:09:06.003
It could be that his target moved.

141
00:09:09.503 --> 00:09:12.403
The perp not only wanted to kill Mr. Fukurokoji,

142
00:09:12.403 --> 00:09:15.203
but also wanted to make it look as if

143
00:09:15.203 --> 00:09:17.403
Mr. Komatsu just happened to get involved and kill them both.

144
00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:22.103
He tried to kill both as if killing two birds with one stone?

145
00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.503
If so, everything falls into place.

146
00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:28.003
The perp luring Mr. Komatsu out here with a love letter

147
00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:32.003
and carrying Mr. Fukurokoji up to the roof and pushing him over.

148
00:09:32.603 --> 00:09:33.803
In other words, the perp is someone

149
00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:37.803
who has a grudge against Mr. Fukurokoji as well as Mr. Komatsu.

150
00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:41.803
Somebody hates you.

151
00:09:41.803 --> 00:09:43.603
What? Me?

152
00:09:45.603 --> 00:09:48.503
There's nobody who hates me.

153
00:09:48.503 --> 00:09:52.103
Then, will you show us the love letter that you received?

154
00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:53.103
What?

155
00:09:53.103 --> 00:09:55.703
We never got anything like that,

156
00:09:55.703 --> 00:09:58.003
so we want to see it.

157
00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:05.503
I thought we could get a clue from it about the perp.

158
00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:06.903
Even so...

159
00:10:06.903 --> 00:10:08.103
"I have always been attracted to you

160
00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:09.903
because no matter how unlucky you are,

161
00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:12.103
you have never gotten depressed.

162
00:10:12.103 --> 00:10:14.103
Please accept my date.

163
00:10:14.103 --> 00:10:16.203
I will be waiting for you at on the night of the 13th

164
00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:19.203
at 8:00 in front of the Beika Daiichi Building.

165
00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:21.803
From me, who is always secretly watching you.

166
00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:23.703
Sincerely with love."

167
00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:26.003
I wonder about you taking this letter seriously

168
00:10:26.003 --> 00:10:28.503
and going to see her when it isn't even signed.

169
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.903
Right!

170
00:10:29.903 --> 00:10:33.903
No! I have a girlfriend although it's just one-sided love.

171
00:10:34.303 --> 00:10:38.303
That's why I went to explain that to her.

172
00:10:39.003 --> 00:10:41.703
More than that, this is what I don't understand.

173
00:10:41.703 --> 00:10:43.803
"PS: Please make sure you bring this letter

174
00:10:43.803 --> 00:10:47.503
when you come to see me."

175
00:10:47.503 --> 00:10:48.703
I wonder why?

176
00:10:48.703 --> 00:10:50.603
To get the letter back, right?

177
00:10:50.603 --> 00:10:51.903
Because it's evidence.

178
00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:54.403
It's impossible to get it back.

179
00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:56.003
Because if everything worked out as planned,

180
00:10:56.003 --> 00:10:58.103
there would have been a commotion.

181
00:10:58.103 --> 00:11:00.803
For what did the perp write something like this?

182
00:11:03.303 --> 00:11:05.903
I'm starved. Let's go grab something to eat.

183
00:11:05.903 --> 00:11:07.603
-What? -Okay!

184
00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:09.703
Okay! Let's all go.

185
00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:12.403
I can treat you to a kiddy plate.

186
00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:14.803
He's not a bad person.

187
00:11:14.803 --> 00:11:17.903
Still, there's someone that wanted to get rid of him.

188
00:11:20.003 --> 00:11:21.503
It's that store.

189
00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:26.103
Sakiko is great.

190
00:11:26.103 --> 00:11:28.603
She's cheerful and energetic.

191
00:11:28.603 --> 00:11:30.403
Is she the woman?

192
00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:32.403
That you're one-sidedly in love with?

193
00:11:34.303 --> 00:11:35.903
How'd you know?

194
00:11:41.403 --> 00:11:42.703
That was good!

195
00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:44.203
I'm full.

196
00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:50.503
I come here every day for lunch.

197
00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:52.503
It's close to my office, too.

198
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:55.403
What? Your office is near here, too?

199
00:11:55.403 --> 00:11:57.903
That person called Yukigaya that we saw a while ago...

200
00:11:57.903 --> 00:12:00.803
What about Yukigaya?

201
00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:03.903
Come to think of it, he hasn't been coming recently.

202
00:12:03.903 --> 00:12:07.903
He used to always eat lunch here before too, right?

203
00:12:11.703 --> 00:12:13.803
I've got to go to the restroom.

204
00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:20.503
I think you know something about it, Sakiko?

205
00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:21.703
What?

206
00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:23.403
You can tell?

207
00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:25.003
What?

208
00:12:25.003 --> 00:12:28.903
About two months ago, he asked me out for a date.

209
00:12:28.903 --> 00:12:31.703
Mr. Yukigaya did, that is.

210
00:12:31.703 --> 00:12:34.303
Why don't we go see a movie next Sunday?

211
00:12:37.003 --> 00:12:39.003
But I refused

212
00:12:39.003 --> 00:12:42.603
and since then he stopped coming completely.

213
00:12:42.603 --> 00:12:45.303
Just because you refused to date him?

214
00:12:45.303 --> 00:12:47.603
He felt uncomfortable.

215
00:12:47.603 --> 00:12:50.103
But Mr. Yukigaya is awesome.

216
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.803
Yet why did you turn him down?

217
00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:55.803
Because I don't care for a person like him who is super confident,

218
00:12:57.003 --> 00:12:59.103
having an air of "I have everything."

219
00:12:59.103 --> 00:13:01.703
I totally agree.

220
00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:04.903
On the other hand, Komat-chan is great!

221
00:13:04.903 --> 00:13:06.003
What?

222
00:13:06.003 --> 00:13:09.003
He believes in God.

223
00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:11.003
He says that if a chain of unlucky occurs,

224
00:13:11.003 --> 00:13:15.003
one day something super good is bound to happen,

225
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.803
because God is not unfair.

226
00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:21.803
He's wonderful for seriously believing something like this.

227
00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:27.703
Oh no, I'll bring you desserts and drinks right away.

228
00:13:30.803 --> 00:13:34.803
This is not one-sided love, but Sakiko likes Mr. Komatsu, too.

229
00:13:35.303 --> 00:13:38.103
Everybody seems to know that, too.

230
00:13:38.103 --> 00:13:41.303
The only one who isn't aware seems to be him.

231
00:13:41.303 --> 00:13:44.803
Mr. Komatsu's really dense.

232
00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:47.303
I've figured out who the perp is.

233
00:13:47.303 --> 00:13:48.903
It's Yukigaya.

234
00:13:48.903 --> 00:13:50.203
What?

235
00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:54.203
He said that he visited Mr. Komatsu because he came nearby, right?

236
00:13:56.103 --> 00:14:00.003
I can see if he came by after a long while.

237
00:14:00.003 --> 00:14:03.103
But he comes around here every day too,

238
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:04.703
because his office is here, right?

239
00:14:04.703 --> 00:14:07.803
It sure sounds unnatural.

240
00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:11.103
He probably came to see Mr. Komatsu to find out

241
00:14:11.103 --> 00:14:15.103
if anybody knew that he was responsible for the crime.

242
00:14:16.603 --> 00:14:18.803
Besides, if he's the perp,

243
00:14:18.803 --> 00:14:22.803
it's understandable that he'd ask Mr. Komatsu to bring the letter.

244
00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:26.603
But the perp not only went after Mr. Komatsu's life,

245
00:14:26.603 --> 00:14:29.403
but after Mr. Fukurokoji's life, too.

246
00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:32.803
That's why the possibility is still only 50%.

247
00:14:32.803 --> 00:14:34.303
If he comes up after the police investigation

248
00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:37.603
now in process is finished then...

249
00:14:37.603 --> 00:14:39.603
it'll be 100%.

250
00:14:50.637 --> 00:14:54.137
Which means a suspicious man emerged from your questioning?

251
00:14:55.737 --> 00:14:57.637
Last night, Mr. Fukurokoji seems to

252
00:14:57.637 --> 00:15:00.537
have been drinking alone in a pub,

253
00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:04.237
saying that he wanted to die like always.

254
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.437
Eventually, a man came over to him.

255
00:15:07.437 --> 00:15:08.837
I wanna die.

256
00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:12.337
Yes. I want to die already, too.

257
00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:15.637
Right? Don't you agree?

258
00:15:17.637 --> 00:15:19.337
Let's go for another drink.

259
00:15:19.337 --> 00:15:21.937
Okay, one more!

260
00:15:21.937 --> 00:15:24.537
The two left the pub.

261
00:15:24.537 --> 00:15:26.637
The man seems to have been wearing worn out clothes

262
00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:29.137
and had disheveled hair.

263
00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.337
He doesn't sound like that man.

264
00:15:31.337 --> 00:15:33.637
Wasn't he a tall man?

265
00:15:33.637 --> 00:15:35.737
He was the athletic type.

266
00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:38.637
You can't fake physique.

267
00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:39.737
Right.

268
00:15:39.737 --> 00:15:41.237
That does it.

269
00:15:41.237 --> 00:15:45.237
But I think that person had nothing to do with this case.

270
00:15:45.837 --> 00:15:47.037
Why not?

271
00:15:47.037 --> 00:15:50.037
When we confirmed with Mr. Fukurokoji...

272
00:15:50.037 --> 00:15:51.637
Come to think of it,

273
00:15:51.637 --> 00:15:54.537
I think I kicked it off well with somebody.

274
00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.637
But he was somebody I saw for the first time.

275
00:15:57.637 --> 00:15:59.037
The first time?

276
00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:00.337
Right.

277
00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:03.537
I can see if they got in trouble, but...

278
00:16:03.537 --> 00:16:05.137
See you then, Conan.

279
00:16:07.037 --> 00:16:09.637
It didn't come up to 100%, did it?

280
00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:12.237
The physique was similar to his,

281
00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.037
but he has no motive.

282
00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:15.837
Besides, they only met each other for the first time.

283
00:16:15.837 --> 00:16:17.437
He's not our man.

284
00:16:19.337 --> 00:16:20.537
I see.

285
00:16:20.537 --> 00:16:23.637
The perp didn't go for killing two birds with one stone.

286
00:16:23.637 --> 00:16:26.637
What do you mean? Because the fact is...

287
00:16:26.637 --> 00:16:29.837
Don't tell me you're thinking of something absurd?

288
00:16:29.837 --> 00:16:32.137
Something absurd?

289
00:16:32.137 --> 00:16:34.137
He would have no compunction in doing anything

290
00:16:34.137 --> 00:16:36.137
being the way he is.

291
00:16:37.637 --> 00:16:41.337
I heard you wanted to talk to me. What is it?

292
00:16:41.337 --> 00:16:43.737
I brought them here because they asked me to.

293
00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:46.737
What? Sakiko.

294
00:16:46.737 --> 00:16:50.737
Mr. Yukigaya, you've never experienced failure, have you?

295
00:16:51.337 --> 00:16:52.837
That's really something.

296
00:16:54.937 --> 00:16:57.037
I don't know if it means anything.

297
00:16:57.037 --> 00:16:59.037
But being the type of person you are,

298
00:16:59.037 --> 00:17:03.037
you must've been super shocked when you asked Sakiko for a date

299
00:17:03.137 --> 00:17:06.037
and she turned you down.

300
00:17:06.037 --> 00:17:08.637
What? Something like that happened?

301
00:17:08.637 --> 00:17:10.537
So what?

302
00:17:10.537 --> 00:17:13.937
So, you schemed what you did this time.

303
00:17:13.937 --> 00:17:15.737
Mr. Komatsu.

304
00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:17.837
It was Mr. Yukigaya.

305
00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:21.737
He was the one who wrote that love letter

306
00:17:21.737 --> 00:17:24.437
as well as pushed Mr. Fukurokoji down from here.

307
00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:26.337
What?

308
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:30.337
You feigned being a woman and sent that letter out.

309
00:17:30.337 --> 00:17:32.937
Then you took Mr. Fukurokoji

310
00:17:32.937 --> 00:17:35.137
who was wasted out from the pub last night

311
00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:37.637
and carried him up to this roof,

312
00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:41.637
and dropped him towards Mr. Komatsu who you had also lured out here.

313
00:17:43.237 --> 00:17:47.237
But consequently, you couldn't kill him like you wanted to.

314
00:17:48.637 --> 00:17:51.337
He'd never do a thing like that.

315
00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:53.537
And why would he want to...

316
00:17:53.537 --> 00:17:55.437
For what?

317
00:17:55.437 --> 00:17:59.437
What do I gain from killing Komatsu?

318
00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:03.137
You wanted Sakiko to suffer a great blow.

319
00:18:04.937 --> 00:18:06.537
He hit the bull's eye.

320
00:18:06.537 --> 00:18:08.537
Me?

321
00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:10.737
If his plan worked out,

322
00:18:10.737 --> 00:18:14.437
Mr. Fukurokoji as well as Mr. Komatsu wouldn't have made it.

323
00:18:18.237 --> 00:18:19.837
I'm sure if Sakiko saw that letter,

324
00:18:19.837 --> 00:18:22.937
she would've been shocked out of her wits.

325
00:18:22.937 --> 00:18:25.937
To think that he died an unfortunate death

326
00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:28.837
just because he was seduced by a woman.

327
00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:31.137
Excuse me! I know him!

328
00:18:31.137 --> 00:18:34.537
Why, Komat-chan?

329
00:18:34.537 --> 00:18:37.537
You're an idiot! Why?

330
00:18:39.937 --> 00:18:43.937
You were going to watch her and snicker.

331
00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:47.937
That in fact was your purpose, Mr. Yukigaya, right?

332
00:18:47.937 --> 00:18:51.937
That's why you had to have him bring the letter along no matter what.

333
00:18:52.437 --> 00:18:56.437
Because it was the most important thing to cause her grief.

334
00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.437
No.

335
00:18:59.437 --> 00:19:03.437
If I die holding a love letter that I received from a woman,

336
00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:06.737
why would Sakiko...

337
00:19:06.737 --> 00:19:08.837
It's about time you realize.

338
00:19:11.437 --> 00:19:12.837
What?

339
00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:20.637
Is it because I turned you down when you asked me for a date?

340
00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:22.337
Just because of something like that?

341
00:19:23.837 --> 00:19:26.737
I think he just couldn't forgive you for it.

342
00:19:26.737 --> 00:19:30.737
Especially because he's a confident person who knows no failure.

343
00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:33.237
But wait.

344
00:19:33.237 --> 00:19:36.437
Why did you want to kill Mr. Fukurokoji, too?

345
00:19:36.437 --> 00:19:38.737
There was no explanation for that.

346
00:19:38.737 --> 00:19:41.137
Anybody would've been okay, right?

347
00:19:41.137 --> 00:19:43.337
But, if you dropped a block or something,

348
00:19:43.337 --> 00:19:46.937
the police would've taken it to be premeditated murder.

349
00:19:46.937 --> 00:19:50.037
Therefore, you had to drop a human.

350
00:19:51.337 --> 00:19:54.737
Even the police wouldn't think that someone would use a human

351
00:19:54.737 --> 00:19:57.437
as a murder weapon.

352
00:19:57.437 --> 00:19:58.737
A murder weapon?

353
00:19:58.737 --> 00:20:02.737
Mr. Fukurokoji was dropped just to kill Mr. Komatsu.

354
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.737
He was used as a human murder weapon.

355
00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.937
What?

356
00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:11.137
The person that you found to use

357
00:20:11.137 --> 00:20:14.337
just for that night was Mr. Fukurokoji, right?

358
00:20:14.337 --> 00:20:17.237
Since he used to always say he wanted to die,

359
00:20:17.237 --> 00:20:18.437
even if you dropped him from the roof,

360
00:20:18.437 --> 00:20:20.637
nobody would think it strange.

361
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.237
They'd just think he finally committed suicide.

362
00:20:24.737 --> 00:20:28.737
Life has no meaning to trash like that anyway.

363
00:20:29.337 --> 00:20:33.337
Rather, it's unsightly for them to be living in this world.

364
00:20:33.537 --> 00:20:36.237
Yukigaya, you...

365
00:20:36.237 --> 00:20:39.937
Mr. Yukigaya, I would like to ask you something.

366
00:20:39.937 --> 00:20:41.537
It's over.

367
00:20:41.537 --> 00:20:44.637
You said to come at 4:00 right, Conan?

368
00:20:44.637 --> 00:20:47.037
Didn't I say 3:30?

369
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:49.537
Rather, what's over?

370
00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:53.237
It seems he confessed to the alleged murder of the two.

371
00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:55.237
He said that he's the perp.

372
00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:59.937
But without proof,

373
00:20:59.937 --> 00:21:02.337
you can't possibly corner me.

374
00:21:04.037 --> 00:21:07.937
And since this perp is really efficient,

375
00:21:07.937 --> 00:21:11.637
he hasn't left any traces of damaging evidence anywhere.

376
00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.437
Not really so, it seems?

377
00:21:14.637 --> 00:21:18.037
This is something that we got a hold of from the very start,

378
00:21:18.037 --> 00:21:21.837
but had no subject to match it to.

379
00:21:21.837 --> 00:21:23.437
Hair?

380
00:21:23.437 --> 00:21:26.837
It was on the button of Mr. Fukurokoji's jacket.

381
00:21:26.837 --> 00:21:28.937
Most likely, back then.

382
00:21:31.337 --> 00:21:35.337
Just in case, we'd like you to give us your hair.

383
00:21:36.437 --> 00:21:40.437
To think that I left evidence on a trash like that...

384
00:21:42.937 --> 00:21:45.537
Even if that were to be my hair,

385
00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:49.537
I have a million other ways to get away with it.

386
00:21:49.537 --> 00:21:53.537
But I'd never do something as unsightly as that.

387
00:21:53.537 --> 00:21:55.837
Because it wouldn't be me

388
00:21:55.837 --> 00:21:58.137
if the act doesn't end beautifully, too.

389
00:22:00.037 --> 00:22:01.737
You...

390
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.837
What's with this guy anyway?

391
00:23:26.837 --> 00:23:30.837
Komat-chan, what's this about a love letter from a woman?

392
00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:35.137
-Hey, Komat-chan, what's it about? -Misfortune turned into fortune?

393
00:23:35.237 --> 00:23:38.037
Isn't it a windfall?

394
00:23:38.037 --> 00:23:40.437
Turn everything to good.

395
00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:42.637
All things come to those who wait.

396
00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:45.337
Those who believe shall be saved.

397
00:23:45.337 --> 00:23:48.237
So, God does exist after all.

398
00:23:48.237 --> 00:23:49.637
I like you!

399
00:23:51.037 --> 00:23:54.237
"Next Episode" -What?

400
00:23:54.237 --> 00:23:56.237
Is it a case?

401
00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:58.337
Is the vacant lot up ahead?

402
00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:01.737
No. We're headed for...

403
00:24:01.737 --> 00:24:03.737
A locked room.

404
00:24:03.737 --> 00:24:07.237
Just saying it gets me excited!

405
00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:10.837
Okay! Detective Squad, off we go!

406
00:24:10.837 --> 00:24:12.937
Yes, I got it, too!

407
00:24:13.737 --> 00:24:15.737
What?

408
00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:17.137
Next Conan,

409
00:24:17.137 --> 00:24:21.137
"Detective Squad's Locked Room Deduction Battle"

410
00:24:36.737 --> 00:24:39.037
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:39.037 --> 00:24:41.237
"Water"

412
00:24:41.237 --> 00:24:43.137
-Water boils. -The bath Water boils.

413
00:24:43.137 --> 00:24:44.237
Ideas boil over.

414
00:24:44.237 --> 00:24:46.137
-Boil, I'm thirsty. -What?
