1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,850
A racing second hand,
a glittering galaxy!

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,550
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,260
Today's case has a crazy
secret behind a kidnapping!

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,680
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,600
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,020
His name?

7
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,329
Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi,
and I were playing Kick-the-Can,

8
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,999
but soon found ourselves
having lunch at a restaurant

9
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:48,129
with Two-Mix vocalist,
Takayama Minami-san.

10
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:55,009
She had snuck out to look for her
missing partner, Nagano Shiina-san.

11
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,779
But at the restaurant, she was
kidnapped before our very eyes!

12
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,069
The kidnappers demanded
the bag she left at the restaurant.

13
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,009
What's more, they
demanded that we take it.

14
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:18,159
It appeared they were
after a Two-Mix demo tape.

15
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:24,499
After taking the bag as ordered,
the kidnappers contacted us

16
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,229
and said to lose the officers and
have Ayumi deliver the tape alone.

17
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,049
I can't put Ayumi in danger!

18
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,159
So, I devised a plan...

19
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,329
Hello?

20
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:53,119
Good work, little girl.

21
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,159
There aren't any cops around, I hope?

22
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,619
No, there doesn't
seem to be anyone...

23
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,539
Perfect.

24
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,009
Ready to come, like I told ya?

25
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:04,889
Yeah...

26
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,129
I'll try my hardest!

27
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,159
"The Popular Artists
Abduction Case (Part 2)."

28
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:18,799
What?! Conan-kun and
Ayumi-kun switched places?!

29
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,599
My word...

30
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,329
The kidnappers
are after the demo tape!

31
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,459
They said to have Ayumi
deliver it and to lose the police--

32
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,069
...so Conan-kun switched with me!

33
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,529
But, why didn't
you tell us you switched?

34
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:42,039
They'd be most off guard if we
let them think their plan worked!

35
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,539
So, Conan-kun said we couldn't
let anyone know until then!

36
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:50,789
But, now we can't
locate the kidnappers...

37
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,459
Conan-kun is in danger.

38
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,429
Oh, he said that these
Tracking Glasses should--

39
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,759
At this rate, Conan's
gonna get all the credit!

40
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,389
We can still find their
hideout and then tell the police!

41
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,999
And then, after we've saved Two-Mix...

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,859
Junior Detective
League Saves the Day!!

43
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:15,069
Thank you, boys!

44
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:16,709
It's all thanks to you!

45
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,159
Ok! Let's go catch those kidnappers!

46
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,119
What are you shouting about?

47
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:36,329
No, we were saying,
"Oh! We're so hungry!"

48
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,219
Right?

49
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:42,049
Y-Yeah... We were saying,
"Oh! We're so hungry!"

50
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,959
Well, we're off to buy some food!

51
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,519
Come back quickly, now.

52
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,249
We will!

53
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:55,029
♪ We're so hungry!
We're so hungry! We're so hungry! ♪

54
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:06,209
Hello?

55
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:09,579
As agreed, it looks
like you came alone.

56
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,289
Now, bring the tape up to the
2nd floor of the nearby warehouse.

57
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,509
Your beloved Two-Mix is waiting!

58
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,469
Won't be needing you anymore!

59
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,969
Say your prayers
while you still have time.

60
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,249
I brought it, Mister!

61
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:30,499
Oh, thanks, little girl!

62
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,149
Who're you--

63
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:41,959
Huh? Where's the guy
from the coffee shop?

64
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,239
Is he out somewhere?

65
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,759
That the place?

66
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,409
No question about it!

67
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,709
Do you think Conan-kun is ok?

68
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,579
Now what?

69
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,619
We need to contact
the police for now.

70
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,869
There's a phone booth over there!

71
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,119
Ok! Let's go!

72
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,889
Yeah!

73
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,329
1-1-9...

74
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,539
Wait! That's the fire department!
The police is 110!

75
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,619
Oh yeah.

76
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,829
And don't you need
to press this button?

77
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:19,609
Oh yeah.

78
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,289
This is 110.

79
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,499
Um, Inspector Megure, please!

80
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,449
Hello? Where'd you go,
little boy? Hello?

81
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,499
Hello?!

82
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,169
Ow!

83
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,879
How did you find us?!

84
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,339
I was told to bring this tape here.

85
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,459
Yeah, they really questioned
us about where the tape was...

86
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,559
But why would they want it?

87
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,539
Let's save the details
for after we've escaped.

88
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,359
And the police are on their way.

89
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,159
The police?!

90
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,709
They're on their way here right now,
using my Tracking Glasses.

91
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,029
It homes in on
this badge's transmitter.

92
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,819
Who are you?

93
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,039
Edogawa Conan.

94
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,029
A detective.

95
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,989
Detective?!

96
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:14,539
Let's hurry before the
other kidnapper comes back...

97
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:20,089
Are those your
"Tracking Glasses"?

98
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,469
Conan-kun...

99
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:22,709
You guys!

100
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:24,679
What're you doing here?!

101
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:30,249
I caught 'em snooping around here.

102
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,619
You idiots! Why didn't you
give the glasses to the police?!

103
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,809
We just wanted...

104
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,809
You'll have plenty of time to fight...

105
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,769
...in the afterlife!

106
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,249
So long.

107
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:57,249
I'm nice enough to turn
you into ashes. Be grateful.

108
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:01,499
Wait! At least tell us
why you kidnapped us!

109
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,539
Ask Buddha in the afterlife.

110
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,679
"The countdown bell sounds..."

111
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,619
"and says to change hearts and run."

112
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,929
"It rings once, twice..."

113
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,119
"Like the sound of off-season fireworks..."

114
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:20,209
"Like the sound of someone,
somewhere, confessing their love..."

115
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,109
You damn kid...

116
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,329
That's right. The lyrics
on the Two-Mix demo tape.

117
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,569
And the reason
you kidnapped Two-Mix!

118
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,409
Isn't that right,
Miyahara Satoshi-san?

119
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:39,869
The night of New Year's Eve,
you killed a man near Shoenji Temple

120
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,879
and were investigated
by Inspector Megure.

121
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,829
New Year's Eve?!

122
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,289
Shoenji?

123
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:49,549
That's where we came
up with that song!

124
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:57,769
There was a murder near that
temple when the bell rang at 11:50...

125
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:06,459
Since the man died holding the gun,
had gunpowder on his hands,

126
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,739
and there was an empty
shell in the barrel,

127
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:17,709
the police believed your claim
that it went off during your struggle

128
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,169
with the gun-toting maniac.

129
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,669
But, that wasn't actually the case.

130
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:28,589
You had brought the gun
to kill him from the very start!

131
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,789
After shooting him through
the heart with the first shot,

132
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:36,679
you loaded another bullet into
the barrel and fired at the ground...

133
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:42,649
...with his hand on the gun, to leave
behind traces of gunpowder!

134
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:47,959
There were no witnesses around,
so while you called the police,

135
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:53,619
the man sleeping outside was to
run off with the extra bullet and shell

136
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:55,629
to put you in the clear.

137
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,579
But, there were people
who heard those sounds...

138
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,079
You don't mean--

139
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,549
Yeah. You two from Two-Mix.

140
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,829
The "countdown bell"
was the New Year's bell.

141
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:12,579
The two fireworks
were the two gunshots.

142
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:19,469
And the line, "1996 just flew right by,"
indicated the year it happened.

143
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:23,959
Add in Shoenji Temple,
which you mentioned on the radio,

144
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,939
and the time and place of
the gunshots becomes clear.

145
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:33,249
I assume you heard the radio show
the demo tape was played on.

146
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,659
So you kidnapped Two-Mix...

147
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,179
...to get rid of the tape and
them before the police found out!

148
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,379
Pretty clever.

149
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,789
That's right. I'm Miyahara Satoshi.

150
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:58,429
The guy I killed was an old
bank-robbing partner of ours.

151
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:03,709
He suddenly threatened
to tell the cops, so I offed him.

152
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,959
Couldn't you have
just run off after that?

153
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,439
I had no choice.

154
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:15,409
A temple priest had seen my
face while I was on my way there.

155
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,119
Luckily, he was hard of hearing.

156
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:24,369
Said he had to stay at the temple
to ring the bell, so I let him live.

157
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:30,089
Never expected someone to hear
the shots and make a song about it...

158
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,759
A cell phone, huh? Give it here!

159
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:44,179
This is that long-haired guy's
phone I had my partner hold onto...

160
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,649
Damn, can't be careless around you...

161
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,109
But, even if you did call the police,
you'd die before they get here...

162
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,159
Well then, please enjoy your stay.

163
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,119
Hello?

164
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:11,289
Oh, Inspector Megure.
I let them and those kids go unharmed.

165
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:12,209
Bye.

166
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:18,509
That's odd. He didn't even
mention Conan-kun switching places...

167
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:21,869
Inspector. I just got word on the radio

168
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:26,979
that some kids had called
110 and asked for you.

169
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,689
What?! When?!

170
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,649
Um, some fifteen minutes ago.

171
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:33,409
Why didn't they tell us sooner?!

172
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:38,949
They didn't state their emergency,
so the operator thought it was a prank.

173
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,279
Do we know the location?!

174
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:44,789
No, it was too short to trace...

175
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,869
This is bad! If the kidnappers
were the ones who hung up...

176
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,792
It's no use! It's not budging!

177
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,222
Ok! Time for my Power Kick Shoes...

178
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:10,392
Move!

179
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:17,892
Ow! It's no use!

180
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,452
Are you kids ok?!

181
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:26,612
This is bad!
At this rate, we won't survive!

182
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:30,652
Hey! Don't breathe the smoke!
Get lower to the--

183
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:34,332
Little boy!

184
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:36,292
Are you ok?!

185
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,502
Pull yourself together!

186
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:39,872
Little boy!

187
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:45,302
Talk about a nuisance...

188
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:52,072
Those annoying cops...

189
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:53,472
Hey! Quit--

190
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,932
Yay! We're long gone!

191
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:57,982
What?!

192
00:13:57,982 --> 00:13:59,612
We're calling from a police box!

193
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:01,902
See for yourself
if you don't believe me!

194
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:03,992
That's impossible!

195
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:14,982
They're gone!

196
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,162
How did...

197
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:22,622
How did they get out?

198
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:29,802
We did it!

199
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:34,222
See! Told you this
Earring Cell Phone was useful!

200
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:35,602
It sure was!

201
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:38,112
Hurry! We can still
get to the concert in time!

202
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,992
Ok!

203
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:44,152
Everyone duck!

204
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:49,402
Shiina-kun!

205
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,362
Don't mock me, kids!

206
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,912
I'm gonna kill each one of you!

207
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,832
Bastard!
Bastard!

208
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:08,102
That was awesome, Minami-chan!

209
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,342
Talk about strong!

210
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,652
That was close...

211
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:21,062
Ten minutes later, a fire truck
arrived with police cars,

212
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:25,022
and the two-man gang
was put under arrest.

213
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:30,282
Naturally, the Junior Detective
League got a harsh scolding,

214
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:35,202
but Takayama Minami-san
stuck up for us, so we were acquitted

215
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:39,322
and then we rushed to the
Budokan in Inspector Megure's car.

216
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,382
What are you guys doing?!

217
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,582
It's already thirty minutes past!

218
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:54,222
Not good. The crowd's getting antsy.

219
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:59,182
We need to go change,
so wait backstage.

220
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:01,142
Backstage?

221
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,352
We wanna introduce
you to everyone later!

222
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,812
Everyone?

223
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:11,922
Hey! Is Minami-chan still not here?

224
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,782
Geez! What's she doing?!

225
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:17,112
Um... Is this backstage?

226
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:20,242
Hey, now!
You're not allowed back here!

227
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,152
Get back to your seats!

228
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,782
Takayama-san told us to come here...

229
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,712
Eh?! Minami-chan's here?!

230
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,382
Ok! Put the opening song on standby!

231
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:34,092
Hey! Someone go to the dressing
rooms and ask how much longer!

232
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:34,862
Right!

233
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,502
Say, what does this do?

234
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:38,142
Hey! Don't touch that!

235
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:39,052
Sorry!

236
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:47,062
Whoops!

237
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:48,722
My turn!

238
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:49,482
Hey!

239
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:04,112
Oh no! The song's started!

240
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:07,122
What do we do?!
They're not here yet!

241
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:08,952
Stop the song!

242
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:12,592
Are you crazy?! They'd get
even madder if we did that!

243
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,102
So what do we do?!

244
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:16,402
I'm figuring that out!

245
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,052
Say, do you have this song's lyrics?

246
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:22,972
Eh? Yeah,
they're in that CD case...

247
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:26,612
But, what do you want them for...

248
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,442

Good work!

281
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:21,192
So, what did you think
of singing on stage?

282
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:22,452
It was the greatest!

283
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:23,872
I was moved!

284
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,652
I could do it again!

285
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:28,902

286
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:32,122
So, what did the little detective think?

287
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,582
How was the concert?

288
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:39,292
Oh. It was ok, I guess.

289
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,992
You're so cheeky!

290
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:45,722
Come on in.

291
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:49,182
So, this is your dressing room?

292
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:52,142
Oh, Inspector! Can we help you?

293
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:56,112
I'm sorry to ask when
you're so exhausted,

294
00:20:56,112 --> 00:21:00,242
but I was hoping you could come
to the station to give a statement...

295
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:03,302
Oh, okay. Just a minute.

296
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,852
Please, take your time...

297
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:11,242
