1
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.650
A racing second hand,
shining shooting stars!

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.810
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.940
Today's case is of a different color!
What flowers have thorns?

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.490
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.320
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.820
His name?

7
00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:42.769
World Art Award Party.

8
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.389
Did she win that big of an award?

9
00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:56.159
Look! It's Aochi Marika, the actress!

10
00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.619
Look! It's Takahata Koji,
the soccer player!

11
00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:10.089
Geez. Knock it off,
you're acting uncool...

12
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:15.759
Wow! So many famous people,
from celebrities to sports players!

13
00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.029
You idiots! Who do you think I am?!

14
00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.019
I said let go! I was asked to come here!

15
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.479
Old man?!
Dad?!

16
00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.719
Don't you bums even know

17
00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.309
what the unrivaled
Detective Mori Kogoro looks like?!

18
00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:35.319
I'm very sorry, but only
those with invitations may enter.

19
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.809
Ozaki Midori (33) Okano Rika's Assistant

20
00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.659
Wait. I called him here.
Ozaki Midori (33) Okano Rika's Assistant

21
00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.029
Now do you see?

22
00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:46.639
The peerless Mori Kogoro-sama
has arrived on the scene

23
00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.579
to investigate a murder threat!

24
00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.789
M-Mori-san!

25
00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.669
"The Flower Scent Murder Case."

26
00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.909
Okano Rika (28)
Avant-garde Flower Arranger

27
00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.119
We received the threat
letter several days ago.

28
00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:34.339
Flowers of death will bloom
in the Bay Front Hotel.

29
00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:38.469
It's clearly a prank.
You're taking this too seriously.

30
00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.679
Just ignore it.

31
00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:46.019
But, Sensei. It could be real,
so there's no harm in being cautious.

32
00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.889
It's just some people getting
back at me for winning the award.

33
00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.979
Paying them any attention
would be a waste of time.

34
00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.889
Who's she?

35
00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.969
Okano Rika. An avant-garde
flower-arranging artist.

36
00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.389
You know her;
she's on TV all the time.

37
00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.989
Avant-garde flower-arranging?

38
00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.949
She's amazing! She makes
flower buds open right up!

39
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.919
Sorta like a magic trick!

40
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:16.839
You could call it that, but would
you also call me an art world fraud?

41
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.799
What a nasty woman...

42
00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:21.509
Actually, the secret is in the temperature.

43
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.469
Oh?

44
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.559
Mr. Shiraki!

45
00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.719
I hear you were sent some stupid threat letter.

46
00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.519
Shiraki Daisuke (58) Owner of Bay Front Hotel
I hear you were sent some stupid threat letter.

47
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.229
Y-Yes.

48
00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.759
I don't expect any, of course,

49
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.069
but I assume there'll be no
changes to today's party?

50
00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.009
That's--

51
00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.559
Don't worry.

52
00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.309
This party is for me,
so it will all go as scheduled.

53
00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.489
But what if something happens?

54
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.139
It's not just this party.

55
00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.379
Don't forget the Shiraki Group,
which has always backed you up.

56
00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.339
No, of course I won't!

57
00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:02.209
I'll see you around.

58
00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.139
What a jerk...

59
00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.139
He's the owner of this hotel and
the company that finances her art.

60
00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.559
Bastard thinks money can buy him art!

61
00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:20.109
His face makes me sick!

62
00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.279
Wow! These flowers are--

63
00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.269
Don't get into trouble now.

64
00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.809
What is this?

65
00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.039
Liquid nitrogen.

66
00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.499
Isn't that the stuff
that can freeze stuff fast?

67
00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.679
That's right! You're really smart!

68
00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:43.969
It's the Sensei's art secret.

69
00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.679
Is she the one who thought up the idea?

70
00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.389
She made it popular,
more than anything.

71
00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.849
Made it popular?

72
00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.219
This looks great!

73
00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.029
Stop that, Dad!
You're embarrassing us!

74
00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.969
Umm... Are you the famous
Detective Mori-sama?

75
00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:09.829
Yep!

76
00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:13.499
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I have a favor to ask.

77
00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.379
I came to tell him it's almost time,
but he won't respond.

78
00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.839
I see. Say, are there any spare keys?

79
00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.249
Y-Yes! Right here!

80
00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.649
Mr. Shiraki!

81
00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.009
Whose tie is that around his neck?

82
00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.159
It was his.

83
00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:59.579
Definitely looks like he
was strangled to death.

84
00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.419
But something's strange about this body.

85
00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.539
What do you mean?

86
00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.259
When did you get in here?!

87
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.549
I mean, look!
The knot on the tie is in front!

88
00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:12.599
That's true...

89
00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.559
I get it! The killer strangled
him from the front!

90
00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:21.389
You'd expect him to put up quite a
fight if he was being strangled,

91
00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:23.819
especially from the front.

92
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:27.599
In other words, the killer
was someone strong enough

93
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.599
that the victim's struggling
posed no problem at all.

94
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.659
A man... and a rather large one, at that!

95
00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:37.829
But it looks like he
didn't put up a fight at all.

96
00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:38.959
What?!

97
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:44.169
He'd still struggle, no matter
how strong the killer was, right?

98
00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:49.629
Yes. Like scratching at the killer
or trying to undo the necktie.

99
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.059
Right?

100
00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:53.099
Yet, look at his hand.

101
00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:56.059
There are no marks on his nails at all.

102
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.889
Interesting. There aren't
any marks on his nails.

103
00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:02.599
No, that's no guarantee.

104
00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:08.259
It's possible to black out instantly
if strangled with enough force.

105
00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:11.859
The killer must've been someone
as strong as a pro wrestler!

106
00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:16.599
Yeah. Check at once
to see if any such people

107
00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:17.849
are among the party guests!

108
00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:18.829
Yes, sir!

109
00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:21.789
C'mon, now. Isn't that a little too simple?

110
00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:27.709
In any case, we can't move the
body until medical examiners arrive.

111
00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:31.429
Conan! Are you still here?!

112
00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:33.219
Get out, you!

113
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.349
I'd like to speak with
whomever's in charge.

114
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.559
Yes, that would be me.

115
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.769
I'm Megure of
Police Investigative Unit â™ª1.

116
00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:48.029
I hear the owner was killed.
So, what do you plan to do?

117
00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:51.809
Have the party cancelled
immediately, of course.

118
00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:52.739
You can't!

119
00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:53.489
Huh?!

120
00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:56.929
We've invited all these
high-profile guests.

121
00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:00.639
Canceling this event
would tarnish my career!

122
00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:01.659
Sensei...

123
00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:05.599
What selfishness!

124
00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:09.129
Listen, you!
This is a premeditated murder!

125
00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:11.389
I know that, obviously!

126
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:16.429
But the target was the owner, not me.

127
00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:18.349
That means there's no danger now.

128
00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:21.309
Maybe so, but...

129
00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:24.219
She's a really selfish woman...

130
00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:25.229
Still...

131
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:29.929
Bastard thinks money can buy him art!

132
00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:32.489
His face makes me sick!

133
00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:34.309
Don't tell me she--

134
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:37.529
But she wouldn't
have the strength for this.

135
00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:39.849
Inspector!

136
00:09:39.849 --> 00:09:43.759
I found several guests
matching your description!

137
00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:46.059
Anaconda Katagiri, the pro wrestler,

138
00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:49.209
Imamura Kotaro,
the football player, and--

139
00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:55.219
Anaconda Katagiri-sama once
got into a fight with the owner

140
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:58.179
about royalties, at a dinner show.

141
00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:00.639
He's the one! No doubt about it!

142
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:05.599
We can only hope the incident
is that straightforward...

143
00:10:05.599 --> 00:10:11.099
Thank you all for coming
today to Okano Rika-sensei's

144
00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:16.279
World Art Award congratulatory party!

145
00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:23.069
Yeah?

146
00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:29.759
Anaconda Katagiri (35) Pro Wrestler

147
00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:30.749
What?
Anaconda Katagiri (35) Pro Wrestler

148
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:35.089
Anaconda Katagiri-san.
Could we have a word with you?

149
00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:39.139
Later! I want some more food!

150
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.059
Damn you!

151
00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:53.189
Inspector! He has an alibi!

152
00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:58.639
This guy... No, Anaconda-san's been
with his friends the whole time.

153
00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.949
Several people vouch for him!

154
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:01.609
Sorry!

155
00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:09.929
The inspector's in trouble!
He says he needs your help!

156
00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:19.889
There's a faint smell of chloroform.

157
00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:21.469
Hold on!

158
00:11:21.469 --> 00:11:23.429
If he were knocked out first,

159
00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:26.389
even someone weak could strangle him!

160
00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:30.729
But how did they get him
to breathe the chloroform?

161
00:11:33.189 --> 00:11:37.779
Something's not right about
this flower... What could it be?

162
00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:40.929
Wait a minute!
When he was in the dressing room,

163
00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:42.369
the flower on his chest...

164
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:44.829
...was closed!

165
00:11:45.219 --> 00:11:47.409
Yet, now it's open!

166
00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:55.629
His dying was the greatest
commemoration gift ever!

167
00:11:56.219 --> 00:12:00.509
He was nothing but a stepping
stone on my way to fame!

168
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:03.429
A stepping stone
is just a stepping stone!

169
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:06.099
I was never his puppet!

170
00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:08.599
Sensei! What if someone hears you?!

171
00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:15.059
Midori-san. You just need to
shut up and handle my management.

172
00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:18.319
Who do you have to thank
that you can make a living?!

173
00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:21.029
I'm sorry for talking out of line.

174
00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:23.249
Man, she's a real witch...

175
00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:26.029
Coming!

176
00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:29.749
Oh, little boy!

177
00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:32.209
They say it's almost time for the show.

178
00:12:32.469 --> 00:12:34.129
Oh, thank you!

179
00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.089
Sensei. You should be going now.

180
00:12:56.719 --> 00:12:58.759
Yes! Here we go!

181
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:06.889
Chloroform, just as I thought.
And this other bottle has...

182
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:09.639
...a cyanide compound?!

183
00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:12.889
Is the killer still going
after someone else?!

184
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:15.169
But how?

185
00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.089
Ice cubes?

186
00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.929
Chloroform ice!

187
00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.099
Now I see!

188
00:13:27.099 --> 00:13:32.469
The frozen chloroform slowly
melted in the room's temperature

189
00:13:32.469 --> 00:13:34.359
and the victim inhaled it!

190
00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:38.429
And this time, it'll be cyanide!

191
00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:40.849
But how?

192
00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.659
A flower petal?

193
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:54.579
She's amazing! She makes
flower buds open right up!

194
00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:57.499
It's the Sensei's art secret.

195
00:13:57.719 --> 00:14:02.469
So the closed flower
had a secret hidden inside it!

196
00:14:02.469 --> 00:14:05.259
The flower had been frozen, too!

197
00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:08.719
The frozen chloroform
was placed inside,

198
00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:10.849
then the flower was frozen.

199
00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:16.349
No one would suspect a thing this way--

200
00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:21.319
because all the party guests
were wearing flowers on their chests.

201
00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.569
And then, when the flower
warmed up in the room's temperature,

202
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:29.029
it started to re-open,
and the chloroform also vaporized.

203
00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:34.079
The owner breathed in the
chloroform and went comatose,

204
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:36.999
upon which he was
slowly strangled to death.

205
00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:41.459
His dying was the greatest
commemoration gift ever!

206
00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:46.559
If Okano Rika is the killer,
who will she go after next?!

207
00:14:52.754 --> 00:14:56.094
What's wrong?! Fight me!

208
00:15:00.714 --> 00:15:03.724
The target's flower should be closed!

209
00:15:04.134 --> 00:15:05.664
I have to find it quickly!

210
00:15:06.694 --> 00:15:09.954
Cyanide evaporates at 25.7â•‘ C!

211
00:15:10.194 --> 00:15:12.424
Once the flower opens, it's all over!

212
00:15:14.884 --> 00:15:18.194
Thank you for your patience,
ladies and gentlemen!

213
00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:23.804
Here is Okano Rika's
Congratulatory One-Man Show!

214
00:15:55.774 --> 00:15:57.104
Damn!

215
00:15:58.444 --> 00:16:00.234
The ice is beginning to melt!

216
00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:02.974
At this temperature,
so will the killer's ice!

217
00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:04.234
Wait a minute!

218
00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:08.474
All the guests were given flowers at
the reception desk beforehand!

219
00:16:13.274 --> 00:16:17.024
In which case, the flower
would've opened long ago!

220
00:16:17.024 --> 00:16:21.984
Was I over-analyzing things?!
Was the owner the only target?

221
00:16:21.984 --> 00:16:26.984
No, then there'd be no
reason to have cyanide ready!

222
00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:30.374
The killer must be planning
to murder someone with it!

223
00:16:31.444 --> 00:16:35.044
That's not it! Where is it?!
Where could it be?!

224
00:16:48.694 --> 00:16:53.894
She's amazing! She makes
flower buds open right up!

225
00:16:54.194 --> 00:16:57.984
Yes! That's it! Don't tell
me she plans to kill her?!

226
00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:10.914
No good! I'm not gonna make it!

227
00:17:13.604 --> 00:17:14.624
That's...

228
00:17:14.624 --> 00:17:15.914
Alright!

229
00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:25.674
What?!

230
00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.724
W-What the...

231
00:17:33.724 --> 00:17:38.194
This kid has ruined my show!

232
00:17:38.564 --> 00:17:41.734
You damn kid!
What were you thinking?!

233
00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:45.194
I'm sorry! I swung it
and it suddenly shot out!

234
00:17:46.034 --> 00:17:48.424
What were you--

235
00:17:51.914 --> 00:17:54.354
Hey, now!

236
00:17:54.354 --> 00:17:57.194
What's wrong, mister?!

237
00:17:57.194 --> 00:17:58.854
What is it, Mori-kun?!

238
00:17:58.854 --> 00:18:01.884
Have you found a
clue to solving the case?!

239
00:18:02.274 --> 00:18:06.804
It was actually I who
had him interrupt the show.

240
00:18:07.144 --> 00:18:11.264
Why would you do that?!
You'll pay for this!

241
00:18:11.644 --> 00:18:14.194
The moment the flowers opened

242
00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:17.734
was to be the moment your life closed.

243
00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:19.354
Come again?!

244
00:18:19.354 --> 00:18:22.944
Mori-kun! Can't you explain more clearly?

245
00:18:23.314 --> 00:18:27.194
Inspector. Please seal
up all the arranged flowers.

246
00:18:27.194 --> 00:18:32.204
Double and triple seal them
so that no air can leak out.

247
00:18:32.204 --> 00:18:37.064
Hidden inside the flowers is
the secret to the owner's murder...

248
00:18:37.064 --> 00:18:39.164
...and a failed murder plot!

249
00:18:39.564 --> 00:18:40.944
Quickly!

250
00:18:40.944 --> 00:18:42.124
R-Right!

251
00:18:47.554 --> 00:18:51.024
We've bagged them all up,
Mori-kun! Now talk to us!

252
00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:57.484
The method behind Shiraki-san's
murder and the other murder plot

253
00:18:57.484 --> 00:18:59.774
was the very theme of Rika-san's
avant-garde flower-arranging...

254
00:18:59.774 --> 00:19:03.984
Yes... making closed flowers open!

255
00:19:03.984 --> 00:19:06.604
Then Okano Rika-san is the killer?!

256
00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:07.624
Was it you?!

257
00:19:07.624 --> 00:19:08.984
N-No!

258
00:19:08.984 --> 00:19:14.414
What nonsense is this?!
Why would I have to kill the owner?!

259
00:19:14.414 --> 00:19:16.394
That's right. It wasn't you.

260
00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:19.874
Because you were the
next to die after the owner!

261
00:19:20.274 --> 00:19:22.584
What?! I was?!

262
00:19:22.584 --> 00:19:25.524
Then just who is the killer?!

263
00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:28.694
The person who put
the flower on the owner

264
00:19:28.694 --> 00:19:31.524
and prepared the flowers on the stage.

265
00:19:31.524 --> 00:19:35.264
Rika-san. You know who that was.

266
00:19:35.444 --> 00:19:40.684
Yes. It was your manager...
Ozaki Midori-san!

267
00:19:41.524 --> 00:19:43.144
Midori tried to kill me?

268
00:19:43.354 --> 00:19:49.614
After all, only Midori-san could've
rigged the flowers on the stage.

269
00:19:49.614 --> 00:19:52.524
But if she's the killer,

270
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:55.324
she would've died from
the flowers she set, too!

271
00:19:55.324 --> 00:20:01.294
Yes. She intended to enact
revenge and die with Rika-san...

272
00:20:01.774 --> 00:20:02.854
Revenge?

273
00:20:02.854 --> 00:20:03.564
Yes.

274
00:20:03.564 --> 00:20:05.254
Her motive was most likely...

275
00:20:05.524 --> 00:20:07.674
Most likely, her motive was...

276
00:20:08.234 --> 00:20:11.884
She made it popular,
more than anything.

277
00:20:12.354 --> 00:20:16.694
Judging from what she said,

278
00:20:16.694 --> 00:20:22.354
Rika-san probably didn't come
up with the flower-opening idea.

279
00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:29.104
That's right. I had to
make Shiraki and Rika pay.

280
00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:33.104
My sister Haruka started this
avant-garde flower-arranging,

281
00:20:33.104 --> 00:20:35.324
and Okano Rika was her student!

282
00:20:35.814 --> 00:20:38.694
But she got Shiraki to sponsor her

283
00:20:38.694 --> 00:20:42.384
in an attempt to become the
top avant-garde flower arranger!

284
00:20:46.314 --> 00:20:51.354
In the art world, it's natural for
the skilled to kick down the unskilled.

285
00:20:51.354 --> 00:20:54.024
But Okano Rika knew
she could never be the best

286
00:20:54.024 --> 00:20:55.854
as long as my sister was around.

287
00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:59.484
So she used dirty tactics and
Shiraki's support to pressure her

288
00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:04.184
into being unable to
take credit for what Rika stole!

289
00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:07.894
On top of that, it was
my sister who came up with

290
00:21:07.894 --> 00:21:10.064
the idea of opening closed flowers!

291
00:21:10.064 --> 00:21:12.234
And Rika decided to--

292
00:21:12.234 --> 00:21:15.484
What happened to your sister after that?

293
00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:22.284
She lost all hope in
everything and took her own life...

294
00:21:24.394 --> 00:21:27.524
Rika doesn't love flowers in the slightest.

295
00:21:27.524 --> 00:21:31.474
She only used them
to gain fame and money.

296
00:21:32.814 --> 00:21:35.314
I learned that all too well

297
00:21:35.314 --> 00:21:37.484
after I changed my name
and became her manager!

298
00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:39.394
That's why she had to pay!

299
00:23:19.094 --> 00:23:24.444
Through this incident, Okano Rika's
plagiarism was made public,

300
00:23:25.304 --> 00:23:29.364
meaning she'll probably never
step onto a center stage ever again.

301
00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:31.454
As for me...

302
00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:32.324
You damn kid!

303
00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:38.294
...I wound up being punished by
the old guy, who slept through it all.

304
00:23:38.764 --> 00:23:40.384
Oww!

305
00:23:44.994 --> 00:23:49.914
There's still a good chance
the criminal group is nearby.

306
00:23:50.914 --> 00:23:53.294
So he's the one responsible?

307
00:23:56.124 --> 00:23:57.074
Don't do it.

308
00:23:58.164 --> 00:24:02.344
You've been asked to
kill that Akabane guy, right?

309
00:24:02.344 --> 00:24:04.474
Wow! So cool!

310
00:24:06.084 --> 00:24:07.724
The officer, too?!

311
00:24:08.454 --> 00:24:12.674
On the next Conan:
"The Robber Hospitalization Case."
