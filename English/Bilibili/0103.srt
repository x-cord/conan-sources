1
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:05,353
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,853
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:08,853
Today's case is
about the acting spirit!

4
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:10,353
Great actor
versus great detective!

5
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:12,233
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,693
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:16,733
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:59,846
Hijikata Kozaburo-san, the historical
drama actor, hired the old guy

9
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:04,096
and showed us to his home on the 5th floor

10
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:05,726
Hijikata
of an apartment building.

11
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,636
Hijikata

12
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,596
While we were on the veranda,
taking in the view,

13
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:14,026
the dead body of Isami, Kozaburo's
wife, collapsed onto the veranda

14
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,636
of Okita Hajime,
who lived next door!

15
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,836
Okita was home,
but denies killing her.

16
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:27,136
Even so, the police and the
old guy are convinced he did it.

17
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:32,456
But, having seen a smile on
Hijikata's face instead of sadness,

18
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,166
I started to doubt it was Okita...

19
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:38,656
...and finally found the proof to flip
the case completely upside-down!

20
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:45,636
"The Historical Drama
Actor Murder Case (Part 2)."

21
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:57,716
There are a lot more
here than I thought...

22
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:00,356
Conan! Go back to where Ran is!

23
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:01,566
Okay!

24
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:08,116
Conan-kun?
Where are you, Conan-kun?

25
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,456
That's weird. Where could he be?

26
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:14,046
Umm, have you seen Conan-kun?

27
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:16,346
Maybe he's in my apartment?

28
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,926
Oh, right!

29
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:29,806
Just as I thought!

30
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:34,606
Conan-kun?

31
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:40,566
Huh? He's not here?

32
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,656
I guess he wouldn't be.
His shoes weren't at the door...

33
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:49,676
I've figured out the trick.
But there's still no proof.

34
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:53,386
I could probably corner Hijikata-san

35
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:56,256
by showing everyone
this strange sight...

36
00:03:57,676 --> 00:04:02,006
But I'd really prefer to
have some definitive proof!

37
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:05,046
C'mon, Conan-kun.
Are you really not here?

38
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:11,596
Damn. If only we had touched
much more obvious stuff...

39
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:14,766
Huh? Wait. As I recall...

40
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,796
Yes! This is it!

41
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:30,366
And, given the old guy's personality,
it should be around here...

42
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:34,746
No question about it!
Hijikata-san is the killer!

43
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:41,666
He used this trick to deceive us
and lead us to this deceptive place!

44
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:47,966
Detective Mori! Is it true there
was a murder in this building?!

45
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,926
C'mon! You can tell us, Mori-san!

46
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:53,796
I hear that the deceased is
Nagakura Isami, the former actress,

47
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:56,846
and that you've been to
the murder scene!

48
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,396
Well, Mori-san?!

49
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:01,356
Now, now. I'd like to have a smoke first.

50
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,846
Inspector.

51
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,676
How do things look
in there, Takagi-kun?

52
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:12,076
Mori-san has the press' undivided
attention by the front entrance.

53
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:17,046
The reporters at the back entrance
have started to come to the front.

54
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,746
Good. Just as we planned.

55
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,136
While Mori-kun
has them distracted,

56
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:24,966
we'll bring the suspect, Okita-san,
and the witness, Hijikata-san,

57
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:28,426
down from the 5th floor, and head
to the station out the back door.

58
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:29,106
Yes, sir!

59
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,186
Oh! Mr. Detective!

60
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:38,786
Oh, Conan-kun! What is it?

61
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:44,246
Kogoro-ojisan said he
has a favor to ask you!

62
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:45,356
You see...

63
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,906
Please, Mori-san!

64
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:50,616
Tell us about the incident!

65
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:56,456
Seems fishy if you ask me!
I bet you don't know anything at all!

66
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,656
Alright! Fine!

67
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:03,696
I'll give you just
one hint! Now come close!

68
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,726
Okita Hajime is the killer?!

69
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,006
The actor?!

70
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:15,176
This is still a secret!
Don't let the inspector hear!

71
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,196
But you're certain, Mori-san?!

72
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:23,246
You saw Isami-san collapse
onto the veranda next door

73
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:27,356
from her husband's own veranda?!

74
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:32,576
And that veranda belongs to
Okita Hajime, who lives on the 5th floor,

75
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:36,246
and when the
police rushed in afterward,

76
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:39,916
both the body
and Okita were there?!

77
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:44,746
That'd mean Okita Hajime
was clearly the killer!

78
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:47,046
Yep, pretty much.

79
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:49,366
Alright! Big scoop!

80
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,506
This'll be tonight's top news!

81
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:55,536
It's me! Get a camera and
newscaster here on the double!

82
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:56,976
We have a breaking story!

83
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,116
Hey, now!

84
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,226
Hold it!

85
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:04,746
N-No, that wasn't me...

86
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:05,646
Huh?

87
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,996
M-Mori-san?!

88
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,286
Do you have more information?

89
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:19,706
And now to use this
voice-changer to talk for him...

90
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:25,076
Yes, it would seem clear
that Okita-san killed her,

91
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:26,666
but that isn't the case.

92
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:31,126
What do you mean?!
Please explain, Mori-san!

93
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:39,926
Alright! Hurry out the back door
while Mori-kun's distracting them!

94
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:44,146
Are you saying someone
else killed her, Mori-san?!

95
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:51,106
Yeah. The killer used a trick to
fool my eyes into seeing it like that.

96
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:57,576
Isn't that right? The real killer,
who's trying to sneak out the back...

97
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:00,536
...Hijikata Kozaburo-san!

98
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:01,826
What?!

99
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,306
It's Hijikata Kozaburo!

100
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:08,916
And Okita Hajime!

101
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,296
H-Hey, now! Hold on!

102
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,076
What's going on here, Inspector Megure?!

103
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,746
Is what Detective Mori said true?!

104
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:20,516
Who do the police consider a suspect?!

105
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,326
Well?!

106
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:23,806
Mori! Knock this off!

107
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:27,266
Besides, how could it be Hijikata-san?!

108
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:32,986
He was with you when
you saw Isami-san fall over!

109
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:37,196
Plus, the fishing line used to strangle her

110
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:38,946
was found in Okita-san's apartment!

111
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:44,036
He was even in his 5th floor apartment,
where the body was found,

112
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,376
when the murder took place!

113
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:51,336
How could anyone else have
carried the body into his room?!

114
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:55,576
Then the killer really is Okita Hajime?!

115
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,076
What was his motive?!

116
00:08:57,076 --> 00:09:01,196
Don't tell us it had to do
with his affair with Isami-san?!

117
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:03,246
No! I'm not at liberty to--!

118
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:07,406
We'll be questioning
him soon about all of that.

119
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:14,446
Yes, given these circumstances,
Hijikata-san couldn't have done it,

120
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:18,866
and Okita-san clearly seems to be the killer.

121
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:25,496
Assuming the veranda we
witnessed Isami-san fall onto

122
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:28,286
was really on the 5th floor, of course!

123
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:33,076
Come again?! What do you mean, Mori-kun?!

124
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:47,973
Assuming the veranda we
witnessed Isami-san fall onto

125
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,543
was really on the 5th floor, of course.

126
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:54,513
Come again?! What do you mean, Mori-kun?!

127
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:58,383
Whose cell phone is that?! Turn it off!

128
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:04,343
It's mine, Inspector. It seems
to have rung at the perfect time.

129
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,933
What nonsense is this?!

130
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:11,183
Are you saying your cell phone
will help explain the incident?!

131
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:16,343
Yes. Please take it from my pants pocket.

132
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:19,903
One of your men is taking a look

133
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:25,033
at the unusual
sight Hijikata-san created.

134
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,093
Yes? Hello?

135
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,513
Huh? Takagi? Takagi-kun?!

136
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:35,253
Why did you call Mori-kun's phone?
Where are you, anyway?!

137
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:41,303
The living room in Hijikata-san's
extra apartment on the 6th floor...

138
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:42,213
...but it's strange.

139
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,673
What? It's strange?

140
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:50,893
It's the same. The TV, the sofa,
the curtains, the table...

141
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,893
Even their positions are the same...

142
00:10:53,513 --> 00:11:00,973
It's all exactly identical to his
living room directly below this one!

143
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:04,693
E-Exactly identical?!

144
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:06,143
Yes.

145
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:09,143
The only difference
is that the 5th floor room

146
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:12,163
has four cups filled
with tea on the table,

147
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:16,623
but the 6th floor table is bare...

148
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,893
What is the meaning of this, Hijikata-san?

149
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:24,593
Why are your living rooms on the
5th and 6th floors exactly alike?

150
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,303
W-Well...

151
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,553
It was to fool me into thinking

152
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:35,023
that Isami-san collapsed on the 5th
floor veranda, rather than the 6th.

153
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:36,103
What?!

154
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,053
Yes.

155
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:42,903
After he took me to his
fake room on the 6th floor,

156
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:46,363
Hijikata-san had me wait in the living room

157
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:50,283
while he strangled
Isami-san in the 5th floor room

158
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,083
and carried her to the 6th floor
room directly above Okita-san's.

159
00:11:55,803 --> 00:12:02,333
He set things up so she would
fall onto the veranda at the right time

160
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,463
and then returned to the living room,

161
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:10,093
pretending to have had
a hard time preparing the tea.

162
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:13,053
He then invited me onto the veranda,

163
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:19,603
and, at just the right time, he used
his cell phone's speed-dial button.

164
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:24,903
He had the sound of the
phone next door attract our attention

165
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:29,743
so we would witness Isami-san
falling onto the veranda.

166
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,393
He did it in such a way

167
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:37,293
that it looked like it had been
Okita-san's veranda one floor below!

168
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:43,253
But that can't be right. Her body
really was in Okita-san's apartment.

169
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:47,303
Now, now. Hear me out, Inspector.

170
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,923
After that, Hijikata-san ran straight to the next-door apartment

171
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,763
Okita
After that, Hijikata-san ran straight to the next-door apartment

172
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:57,263
and shouted and pounded on
the door, but without reply, of course.

173
00:12:57,263 --> 00:13:02,643
That's because it wasn't Okita-san's
apartment, but Hijikata-san's.

174
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:07,693
All the rooms on the 6th floor
belong to Hijikata-san, actually.

175
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:14,063
Afterward, while I went
downstairs to get the spare key,

176
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:16,343
Hijikata-san entered the room,

177
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,593
and used the
rope he had prepared

178
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:24,173
to lower Isami-san to
Okita-san's veranda below.

179
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:26,713
With rope?! H-How?!

180
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:31,263
He probably wrapped
the rope under her arms,

181
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:36,143
lifted her over, lowered her down,
swung her onto the veranda,

182
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:39,473
and then pulled the rope free.

183
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:47,023
As proof, her body has a scrape
mark from when he pulled the rope.

184
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,683
And the scrapes all over her body

185
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:53,153
are from when she was
swung onto the veranda?

186
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,973
It was a dangerous and
unreliable method,

187
00:13:56,973 --> 00:14:01,623
but the veranda faces the river,
so the chance of being seen was slim,

188
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:06,083
plus, even if he
accidentally dropped her,

189
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:10,513
he could explain it away by
saying the killer threw her over

190
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,303
in the heat of the moment.

191
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:15,723
After lowering Isami-san's body,

192
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:22,813
Hijikata-san put the 6th floor
room number plate back to normal,

193
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,643
hurried to Okita-san's door
one floor below,

194
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:32,663
and then nonchalantly waited
for me to bring the spare key.

195
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:38,223
As if he had been
waiting there the entire time.

196
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:43,393
But could he really lower the body,
replace the plate, and all that

197
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,663
while you were getting the key?!

198
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:51,133
You could easily buy that much
time by stopping the elevator above.

199
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:58,093
Hijikata-san probably did many
test runs to figure out the timing.

200
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:04,813
But, Mori-kun! You took the elevator
when he first brought you here!

201
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:09,183
Why didn't you realize
you were on the 6th floor?

202
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:13,983
The floor number display
would've made it obvious right away!

203
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:18,763
Yes. From the moment
I got on the elevator,

204
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:23,953
Hijikata-san's spell
was already at work on me.

205
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:26,163
Eh? Spell?

206
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:32,133
Here, Inspector. Have a look
at the elevator's floor number display.

207
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,053
There's still a little bit left...

208
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:42,053
Signs of the trick he used to
lead me to his place of deception!

209
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:55,023
What's that black smudge?

210
00:15:55,763 --> 00:16:02,143
It's most likely black marker
ink that he failed to wipe away!

211
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:07,013
He marked out the
vertical line on the lower left

212
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,753
to make the 6 look like a 5!

213
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,423
I get it!

214
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:12,463
I wouldn't have thought of that!

215
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,753
Hold on, Mori-kun!
Then what about "2"?!

216
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:20,473
If it's as you say, then that'd
make the number 2 look strange!

217
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:23,343
Yes. I was cleverly fooled there, too.

218
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:27,853
He gave us his business
card inside the elevator,

219
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:31,733
while his back covered the floor buttons.

220
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:37,053
I see! That would
direct your eyes to the cards,

221
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:41,613
and hide the floor buttons
and display from view...

222
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:46,083
He probably wiped the ink off
when he stopped the elevator.

223
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:52,553
My only chance to see the strange
"2" was when I went downstairs,

224
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:57,303
but I was in a hurry
and there was no time for that.

225
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:01,803
Not so fast, detective.

226
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:05,473
You've been saying,
"trick this, deception that,"

227
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,433
and claiming I'm some criminal.

228
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:12,393
Do you have proof that I killed Isami?

229
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:17,863
Proof that I took you to
the 6th floor instead of the 5th?

230
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:22,473
But how do you explain that
the living rooms on both floors

231
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:23,783
are exactly the same?

232
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,843
Oh? Is something wrong with that?

233
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:29,493
I happen to like that furniture and layout.

234
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:35,643
Before you accuse, could we
see this infallible proof of yours?

235
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:39,463
Otherwise, this is nonsense.

236
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,723
Oh?

237
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:45,593
Your confidence must mean
that you wiped away our fingerprints

238
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:49,813
from everything we might've
touched in the 6th floor room!

239
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:50,893
What?!

240
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:55,763
I would surmise you wiped
them away while I was downstairs,

241
00:17:55,763 --> 00:18:01,533
and when you hurriedly took away
the teacups in the 6th floor room.

242
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,243
Hurriedly took away?

243
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:05,893
Yeah.

244
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:10,183
The fact that Detective Takagi was
able to enter the 6th floor room easily

245
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:14,963
means he made the grave blunder
of forgetting to lock the door.

246
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,673
I already told you! Show some proof!

247
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:24,633
Inspector. Please confirm
with Detective Takagi.

248
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:32,063
Ask if there's anything odd on the
floor of the 6th floor living room.

249
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:34,813
T-The floor?!

250
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,403
Takagi-kun! Is there anything
unusual on the floor?

251
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:42,713
Huh? Anything unusual?

252
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,993
There is something!
A metallic, pointed thing.

253
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:50,703
A metallic, pointed thing?

254
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:56,043
In that case, please flip over
the cushions of the nearby sofa.

255
00:18:56,973 --> 00:19:00,643
Something I quickly
hid should be there,

256
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:03,253
with my fingerprints on it!

257
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:11,263
I-Inspector! A model gun!
There's a model gun under the cushion!

258
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:13,013
A model gun?!

259
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,263
What?!

260
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:20,483
Mori-kun! You're certain your
fingerprints are on this model gun?!

261
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,143
Yes.

262
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:27,953
Because I broke it while waiting
for Hijikata-san in the living room.

263
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:33,913
I didn't have the courage to tell him,
so I hid it under the cushion.

264
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:39,593
Never did I imagine it would
be the key to breaking the spell

265
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:42,973
of Hijikata-san's trick like this.

266
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,433
I assume you realize, Hijikata-san...

267
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:51,893
I was with you in Okita-san's room
the entire time after the murder,

268
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:56,803
and I was with Inspector Megure
when I came down here.

269
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:05,263
In other words, unless I'd been
in that 6th floor room from the start...

270
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:09,283
...I wouldn't have been
able to touch that model gun.

271
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,803
Incidentally, the trick to
making Isami-san fall over

272
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:23,173
was probably done by holding her
up with fishing line over a rail,

273
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:27,973
and the line would break or
come undone when the time came.

274
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:34,103
Inspector. Please inspect the
room directly above Okita-san's.

275
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,813
Traces of his set-up might still be there.

276
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:44,433
Not "might." It's definitely still there.

277
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:49,243
The mechanism I used to
make Isami's body fall on its own.

278
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,703
Then you admit to killing her,
Hijikata-san?!

279
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,513
Yes, that's right!

280
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:58,663
It was I, Hijikata Kozaburo,
who murdered my wife Isami!

281
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:03,473
She had to pay for getting
together with this lowlife,

282
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:07,263
and I wanted the money
to rebuild my film studio!

283
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,423
The money from her insurance, that is!

284
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:12,973
Stop that, all of you!

285
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:16,933
So, when did you figure it out, Detective?

286
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:20,893
It was the sound of Okita-san's phone.

287
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,603
It was different from
what I heard on the veranda.

288
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:30,803
Huh? That's odd. I'm certain I prepared
a phone with the same sound.

289
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,073
I just happened to buy a new one yesterday.

290
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,993
Oh. I have no luck.

291
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,643
Though, the main cause of
your downfall was probably that

292
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:43,723
you underestimated Mori-kun
and had him witness your trick.

293
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,713
I never underestimated him.

294
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,143
It was a bet.

295
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:53,013
Had I been able to completely
fool the great Mori-san,

296
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:59,533
I would've made a great detective
in my first modern drama role.

297
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:37,033
Dad! Dad!

298
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,493
That's the great detective
Mori Kogoro for you!

299
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:47,543
Mori-san! How does it feel to have
caught a historical drama actor?!

300
00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:53,113
Oh, uhh...

301
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:56,323
I guess I feel like
Toyama-no-Kin-san!

302
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:58,933
You're a real star!

303
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:04,743
This clown is such a pain!

304
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,943
W-What is this?

305
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:22,133
It's crazy, Dad! All the clocks
in the house are ringing!

306
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,473
What?! The entire house?!

307
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,843
Even the VCR is running...

308
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,043
What exactly is going to happen?!

309
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,543
On the next Conan--

310
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:37,343
"The Case of the Mysterious
Bandit Mansion (Part 1)"
