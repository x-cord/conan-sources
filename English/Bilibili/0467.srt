1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,799
Ski trails.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,899
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,599
A murder feigned to be an accident.

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,999
Disclose the subtle trick using the snowman!

5
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,099
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,199
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,000
We came to the snowy mountains with Dr. Agasa.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Beside Genta and the others who are making a snowman,

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
there are four art university students who are making a snowman

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,600
for their graduation project who we become acquainted with.

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
Yes, this is Sakuko.

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Huh? Talk with me?

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,300
Right now?

15
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,600
Then one of them, Ms. Sakuko Kokura,

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,500
is found dead in a lake below a cliff by the lodge.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,200
Well then, let's go to the cliff where she is thought to have fallen from.

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,300
There may be traces of an accident left, too.

19
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Accident?

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,500
It can't be.

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,100
I wonder if a person who promised to have meals with others in an hour

22
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,800
would go out into the blizzard, carry the snowboard

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,700
and go all the way up the ski trail?

24
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,800
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,900
I can't figure out...

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,000
how Sakuko who was in the lodge...

27
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,100
was thrown into the lake.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,800
"The Unbreakable Snowman (Part 2)"

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,300
This is probably the place where she fell.

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,600
Despite the fence being broken, all that's left is the sign.

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,900
It seems to have broken last week

32
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,000
and it was scheduled to be repaired this weekend.

33
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,400
There seems to be no trace of the snowboard here.

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
It's possible that they could've been erased by the blizzard.

35
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,200
Snowman?

36
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Could this possibly be it?

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,500
The graduation project that you mentioned?

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,300
Yes. What about it?

39
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,300
While you were making this, Mr. Itabashi,

40
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,700
did you hear Sakuko's voice?

41
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,800
I mean, you were pretty close to the place where she fell from.

42
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,700
No. I was here till before 1 pm,

43
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,200
when I promised to have lunch with everyone.

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,500
I didn't hear her voice at all.

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,800
I was absorbed in making this and the blizzard was pretty bad.

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,100
The wind was howling loudly, too.

47
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,500
And I've been bothered about something for a while.

48
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,700
What's this?

49
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,800
A snowman.

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,100
But the thing is,

51
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,700
Itabashi is the only one who knows how close it is to being finished.

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,300
Because the blueprint's in his head.

53
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,200
A snowman?

54
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,100
Well, even I can tell that it's incomplete.

55
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,600
Because, look,

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,900
there are apples, bananas and oranges over there.

57
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,500
You guys were gonna use these later, right?

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
You're wrong.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,100
Those are for our snowman.

60
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,600
The head fell off because of the blizzard.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
What?

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Is that right?

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
I see.

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
Hey, hold up!

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't step on that place too much

66
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,100
because the detective badges are buried there.

67
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,700
How nostalgic.

69
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,400
I used to do this when I was a child, too.

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,800
Putting gloves on the tip of a stalk.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Not again!

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,900
Hey, are you all right?

73
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Genta!

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Genta!

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Is something coming out?

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,600
Genta.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
-You've got a nose bleed. -You've got a nose bleed.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
-A nose bleed. -A nose bleed.

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Gosh, don't move.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Here.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,900
All finished.

82
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,900
All you've got to do is stay still for a while, okay?

83
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Ai, you're fantastic! Just like a nurse!

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Talk about unlucky.

86
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
No. I envy you, Genta!

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,800
But I can't believe you got a nosebleed from falling on snow.

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
I guess something must have been buried under there.

89
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
There was nothing like that buried.

90
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,500
But it tasted sort of funny.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,800
Tasted funny?

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
Funny taste?

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
-The snow? -Yeah.

94
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Hey, Genta. How did it taste?

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,900
The snow. How did that snow taste?

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
It was salty.

97
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,500
That's...

98
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Doc.

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,100
Did you get anything?

100
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah.

101
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,200
The autopsy revealed that the same water from the lake

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,800
was found in Sakuko's stomach.

103
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
That means that this is an accident after all, right?

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,700
No.

105
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,600
Maybe that's something

106
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,500
that'll back up the fact that this is a homicide case.

107
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,300
It could be the ski trails that the culprit left behind.

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,800
Yes, that's right.

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,500
Although some doubts still remain.

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
I guess this is an accident.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,400
I want to rush back to the station and...

112
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
What? You're treating everyone to a Japanese nabe dish today?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
That sounds just great!

114
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Please count me in on that seat that's not taken yet.

115
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
What?

116
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,100
But if there are unclear points, I should investigate more?

117
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,000
The percentage of this being a homicide is zero!

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
It is 120% an accident.

119
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
-No. -So...

120
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Huh?

121
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,900
It may not necessarily be a plain accident.

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Hey, hey. Just what's going on, officer?

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,300
I mean you called us all the way out here.

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,300
We've already told you everything we know.

125
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Sakuko died of an accident, didn't she?

126
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Yes, but he said something strange.

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,100
No, no. It's nothing strange.

128
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,200
The old man with the children.

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Sakuko did not die of an accident, but was killed.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,300
Moreover, the culprit is...

131
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,300
among you three.

132
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,600
That's what I'm saying.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
Huh?

134
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,066
Excuse me.

135
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:36,866
I brought them here since I thought you found a new clue to the accident.

136
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,466
But you went and act like a detective saying that this is a homicide case.

137
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,466
No.

138
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,366
Judging from the circumstances back then,

139
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,966
it seems only plausible that Sakuko went out into the blizzard

140
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:49,466
and fell over with her snowboard from the place where the broken fence is.

141
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:54,666
Due to snowstorm, she drowned to death in the lake.

142
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:59,266
The only road to get to the bridge that leads to the lake was blocked off.

143
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:03,766
Not until the police got here.

144
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,966
Oh, that's why...

145
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:10,766
Moreover, there are about 10 meters from the edge of the cliff to the lake.

146
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,666
So even if someone were to push her down from the cliff,

147
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,066
she wouldn't have been able to fall into the lake.

148
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:20,366
And then, there's one last thing.

149
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,366
An hour after they parted with Sakuko,

150
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:26,266
the three realized that she didn't show up at the promised time,

151
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,366
so they were looking around for her together all the way,

152
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:33,666
all the way until her dead body was found.

153
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,966
Let's say that even if a rope were used,

154
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,066
it would've been impossible for the culprit

155
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:41,266
to carry her on his back down the cliff to the lake and bury her,

156
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,566
then climb back up again.

157
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:48,766
You can't be telling me that any of them could possibly...

158
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,066
Come on...

159
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,066
Hey.

160
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,666
Sorry. I figured it'd be faster this way.

161
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,566
Officer?

162
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,366
Hey, are you all right?

163
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:04,166
He looks to be asleep.

164
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,666
True.

165
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,066
No, no. I'm not sleeping.

166
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,266
I'm so upset at myself that I went weak in the legs.

167
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,566
I guess that's how it is.

168
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:20,166
I couldn't figure out a simple trick like this until now.

169
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,466
Trick?

170
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,566
That's right.

171
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:27,266
The culprit put Sakuko in a certain container,

172
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:30,866
then pushed it over the cliff.

173
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,666
Certain container?

174
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:37,266
Hey, don't tell me that she was put in a sleigh or something?

175
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:40,166
Even if she were put in a sleigh,

176
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,666
I think she would fall off balance on a bumpy slope like this.

177
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:49,266
Besides, even if someone ride it down together with her,

178
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:52,466
that person would have to climb that cliff anyway.

179
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:56,366
Sleigh? Nothing unstable like that was used.

180
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:59,666
The thing I'm referring to is something that she was put inside

181
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,666
that would definitely land into the lake

182
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,166
and will disappear after a while.

183
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,966
Land?

184
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,966
Then disappear?

185
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,766
Ridiculous.

186
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:13,466
Nothing that convenient exists.

187
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,266
I see.

188
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,266
But instead of beating around the bush

189
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,366
and saying that it landed and disappeared,

190
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,766
a better explanation would be that it rolled down and melted.

191
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,266
It's easier to understand by putting it that way, don't you think?

192
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,066
I see.

193
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,066
What?

194
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,766
Remember? We were making it together yesterday.

195
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,666
We made it?

196
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,966
I see!

197
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,766
We made it together?

198
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,466
Yes, I'm sure he's referring to...

199
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,166
The snowman!

200
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:52,866
If the lady was put inside the snowman and pushed over...

201
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:56,966
It would simply roll down the cliff and fall right into the lake.

202
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:02,466
The snowman would melt and Sakuko would be found floating in the lake.

203
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:05,266
It seems that lake is a hot spring

204
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,166
and the water temperature is a bit high.

205
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,866
Snowman?

206
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,366
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,466
Huh?

208
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,166
I know Sakuko was pretty small,

209
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,066
but I doubt you'd be able to fit a normal sized person in a snowball.

210
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:24,166
It would break apart before reaching the lake.

211
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,566
I guess so.

212
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,366
The snowman would at least have to have a diameter of about two meters.

213
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:32,666
But even if such a large snowman were made,

214
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,166
I think it'd be impossible to roll it down the cliff alone.

215
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,566
No, it doesn't have to be that large.

216
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:39,566
Huh?

217
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:40,566
Yes.

218
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:44,266
The size only needs be as big as the one I'm leaning against.

219
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,266
Leaning against?

220
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,966
A snowman about this size would suffice.

221
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:52,566
Like I just said,

222
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,566
something that size would fall to pieces half way

223
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,566
and the contents would come out before reaching the lake.

224
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,266
That sounds right.

225
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:02,066
Hey, say something.

226
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,066
Hey!

227
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,066
Shoots!

228
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,766
What's wrong?

229
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,466
What's with him?

230
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,866
Hey, are you trying to be funny?

231
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,366
No.

232
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:20,166
I just wanted to remind you.

233
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,866
About the time that Genta fell near this snowman

234
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,366
and had a nose bleed.

235
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,266
Genta!

236
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,066
Is something coming out?

237
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,166
Genta!

238
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,166
-You've got a nose bleed. -You've got a nose bleed.

239
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,866
-A nose bleed. -A nose bleed.

240
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,166
So what about it?

241
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,766
Genta, do you remember something about that snowman back then?

242
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,666
Yeah.

243
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,966
It was hard and salty.

244
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,166
That's right.

245
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,566
That's the vital point of this trick.

246
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:57,566
Salt.

247
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,066
Well, am I right?

248
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,366
I see.

249
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:05,966
He used the chemical reaction of salt to harden the snowman.

250
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,066
Chemical reaction?

251
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,966
When salt is poured onto snow, the freezing point,

252
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,166
the temperature will drastically drop,

253
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,966
and the part that salt was poured onto would melt.

254
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:18,966
But before melting, it absorbs the heat from its surroundings,

255
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,066
so the snow around the area where the salt is not poured onto

256
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,866
freezes and becomes hard.

257
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,166
This method is commonly used at ski race courses

258
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:31,666
or when hardening igloos.

259
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,766
But at ski courses,

260
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:35,366
they would normally use sulphate ammonium

261
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,666
to prevent damage after the snow melts.

262
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,066
Sulphate ammonium?

263
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,566
Sulphate ammonium?

264
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:47,266
Well, I guess when you get older,

265
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,566
you'll learn about it in home economics cooking class.

266
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,166
Hey, hey.

267
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,066
All of this means nothing.

268
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:56,866
But where was that snowman that was hardened using salt?

269
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,566
Are you saying you saw it?

270
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:02,366
I didn't see it, but it probably was done here.

271
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,366
Right at this snowman near me.

272
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:09,966
Since the snowman was hardened here using salt,

273
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:13,466
the snow that accumulated on the ground also hardened.

274
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:16,766
That's why Genta had a nose bleed when he fell.

275
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,466
Huh?

276
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:21,366
Was done here? Isn't it still there?

277
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:25,566
This is the one the culprit made in haste after he committed the murder,

278
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:28,066
so that no one would see through the snowman trick.

279
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:31,466
He remade the torso only.

280
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:33,066
As proof of that...

281
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,266
Look.

282
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:40,466
The head is also hardened with salt, isn't it?

283
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,566
As long as the shape doesn't collapse,

284
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:47,466
all he has to do is put the head back on the torso.

285
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:49,266
Wait a second.

286
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,366
Then...

287
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,366
Don't tell me the one who put Sakuko in the snowman and dropped her is...

288
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,466
That's right.

289
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:57,766
The person who was making a snowman the entire time,

290
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,166
Mr. Itabashi!

291
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,666
There's no one else but you who could've done it!

292
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,966
Although it only required him to put the head back onto the torso,

293
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,966
revisions on the detailed form where the head and torso are joined

294
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:13,366
can only be done by Mr. Itabashi who made it.

295
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,066
After Sakuko parted with everyone, Mr. Itabashi most probably

296
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,666
used the blizzard to his advantage and called her outside.

297
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,666
He did so, because he wanted her to come out wearing her gear.

298
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,666
When she came outside, he probably said to her,

299
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:32,666
"Let's go back to the room and talk because the blizzard is bad."

300
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,966
He then lured her to his room.

301
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:46,066
You pushed her face down into the wash basin that was filled with water.

302
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,166
And drowned her.

303
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,766
Then in the blizzard where the vision was unclear,

304
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:58,666
you carried her after putting the snowboard boots on her.

305
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,866
You put her and her snowboard inside the torso of the snowman

306
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:06,066
where you had made a hollow space in.

307
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,766
You covered it with a lid made of snow.

308
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,566
You rolled the snowman...

309
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,366
to the cliff...

310
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,766
and dropped it.

311
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:33,166
You finally succeeded in making her float in the water.

312
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,666
But can you do all that in just an hour?

313
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,766
After he dropped the snowman with Sakuko inside it,

314
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,866
he made the torso of the snowman, right?

315
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:45,166
When Itabashi came to meet with us,

316
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,666
he wasn't breathing hard or anything.

317
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,666
It's true that he'd be tired if he made something this size in an hour,

318
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,066
but if he used something that was already half made,

319
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:57,966
only half the time and labour are required.

320
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,066
Half?

321
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,566
You people probably didn't know,

322
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:08,166
but in order to surprise you, the children did something to their snowman.

323
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,566
Isn't that right, you guys?

324
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,266
Huh? Yes.

325
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:14,066
We did it to surprise you by letting out voices

326
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:16,466
when you came here next time.

327
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:19,966
We did something to our snowman's head.

328
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,666
We put our detective badges into the head part.

329
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,766
Huh?

330
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,666
Huh? That's the sound of the detective badge.

331
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,066
The sound's coming from the stomach of the snowman.

332
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,366
Which means, the head of our snowman didn't fall off

333
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,866
because of the blizzard.

334
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,866
After Mr. Itabashi removed the fruit parts,

335
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:45,766
he used that as a base to make the torso of the snowman.

336
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:51,466
But that doesn't serve as proof to brand Itabashi as the culprit.

337
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:54,866
The evidence is the wash basin in Mr. Itabashi's room.

338
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:58,966
The autopsy revealed that the water found in Sakuko's stomach

339
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,866
was the same as the water of the lake below the cliff.

340
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:06,166
So it's most likely that the evidence is still there,

341
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:11,566
the water that Mr. Itabashi brought from the lake in order to drown her.

342
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:14,666
And her hair may also be found with it, too.

343
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,266
It could be the wash basin in her room,

344
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:21,966
but I'm sure that Mr. Itabashi used his own room to commit the murder.

345
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,866
If he used her room,

346
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:27,366
he would've probably brought her goggles, gloves and cap along

347
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,566
and put them on her before putting her into the snowman.

348
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,266
But...

349
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,066
Itabashi had no reason to kill her!

350
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,166
Yeah.

351
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:42,966
I didn't think I'd end up doing what I did either.

352
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,966
But when Asaka came into the picture,

353
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,966
I guess I lost my mind for an instant.

354
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:48,966
Huh?

355
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:51,266
Just what do you mean?

356
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:53,866
Itabashi!

357
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,166
You knew, didn't you?

358
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,566
That Sakuko was in love with you.

359
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,166
And you're in love with Asaka.

360
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,166
You like the way she gracefully used to ski around the ski slopes.

361
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:13,066
In order to erase Asaka's gracefulness from your heart,

362
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,866
that woman

363
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:18,366
made Asaka wear snowboard boots that she wasn't experienced with yet,

364
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:20,866
lured her to a dangerous course where she got into an accident

365
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,566
and took Asaka's leg away from her.

366
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,466
All for such a stupid reason.

367
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,966
Hey, are you serious?

368
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:31,666
Yeah, she was muttering about it when she was drunk once.

369
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,166
Hey, you're drinking too much.

370
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,766
This is all Asaka's fault.

371
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:42,166
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

372
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,766
Everything worked out up to the time I lured her out

373
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:48,466
and she broke her leg like I expected her to.

374
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,966
But why hasn't she disappeared yet?

375
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,666
That Asaka.

376
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,366
What'd you say?

377
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,166
It's so sickening, really.

378
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:04,366
The doctor told her that she wouldn't be able to ski again and yet...

379
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,966
No way.

380
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:10,166
Itabashi!

381
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,466
Why?

382
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,966
Why didn't you tell me about it?

383
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,666
Itabashi!

384
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:27,366
I can't do something like sending salt to an enemy.

385
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,566
-Enemy? -Yeah.

386
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:32,166
Knowing your character, if you found out about it,

387
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,966
who knows what you would've done to Sakuko.

388
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,966
I just couldn't stand giving it away to you.

389
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:43,966
The role of taking Asaka's enemy away and take the blow.

390
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,866
I didn't want to give away this crazy role to you.

391
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,266
But it sure was a surprise.

392
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,266
Putting salt on the snow hardens it.

393
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:25,766
-Right? -Nope,

394
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:28,166
it not only just hardens it.

395
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,966
If you sprinkle salt on snow and mix them,

396
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:34,066
it breaks down and continues to melt.

397
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,766
Eventually, the salt disappears.

398
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:40,466
Calcium chloride is used in the same way on snowy streets

399
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,166
to help melt the snow.

400
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,266
That's right.

401
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:47,466
He used it in the wrong way.

402
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,666
The salt.

403
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,766
He used salt in the wrong way.

404
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,966
He didn't melt and dissolve his intention to kill,

405
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:58,666
but rather, solidified it.

406
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:09,166
"Next Episode"

407
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,666
Alligator snapping turtle?

408
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:16,166
Alligator snapping turtle and one million yen...

409
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,666
What's the matter, Conan?

410
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,866
Maybe the two cases are connected in some way.

411
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:26,966
I won't let you get away!

412
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:32,966
Next Conan, "Lakeside Mystery"

413
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,966
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,966
"X-Ray"

415
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:54,466
The next episode is a story about a turtle.

416
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:55,666
A super vicious one, too!

417
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,966
I'm scared.
