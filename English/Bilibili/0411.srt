1
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.040
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.740
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.540
Today's story's stage is set on a village shrine.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.940
Another meaning to the letters we've been seeing

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.640
is hiding an unexpected secret!

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:59.825
"Stag beetles..."

10
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:03.525
"Hercules beetles..."

11
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:10.125
It must be around here.

12
00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:19.525
Why do I have to look for insects...

13
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:25.325
on a hot day like this?

14
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:29.225
Hey. Mitsuhiko, are you sure they're around here?

15
00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:33.025
Wait a second.

16
00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:40.225
Moreover, there's garbage everywhere in this mountain.

17
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:41.825
It can't help it.

18
00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:45.325
The people from the village usually take turns cleaning up,

19
00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:47.325
but yesterday there was a festival

20
00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:50.025
and a lot of people seem to have come here.

21
00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:53.025
A festival?

22
00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:55.125
It's called the Tento Festival

23
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.625
where people walk through town

24
00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:00.125
with a float decorated with eight million Gods.

25
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:03.125
Look, that's the shrine over there.

26
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.525
That shrine gate is the starting point.

27
00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:09.625
Behind the float that is lit up with colourful lights,

28
00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:11.125
and fireworks are shot up in the air.

29
00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.525
It is indeed a magnificent sight!

30
00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.125
Doc, you were here last night?

31
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.325
Well, that's...

32
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.225
What...

33
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:26.325
Why didn't you bring us with you?

34
00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:28.225
That's not fair!

35
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:30.625
We wanted to see the fireworks, too!

36
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:43.725
"Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 1)"

37
00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:47.425
We had our reasons, too.

38
00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.425
Isn't it right, Ai?

39
00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:53.525
Right, I'm sleepy because of it.

40
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.425
You're always sleepy.

41
00:03:56.425 --> 00:04:00.625
What were the two of you doing here?

42
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.925
Did you two came here to catch insects?

43
00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:05.525
Well, something like that.

44
00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.325
What?

45
00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:11.325
But we didn't see any unicorn beetles or stag beetles.

46
00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:15.125
You can't find any of it just by groping around here and there.

47
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.525
I'm not just groping around!

48
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:22.125
I'm selecting trees like saw tooth oak that the unicorn beetles like.

49
00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:26.825
Mitsuhiko, touch the ground of the root.

50
00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:28.125
Hard, isn't it?

51
00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:29.725
Yes.

52
00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:33.625
And there's garbage, but no fallen leaves.

53
00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.125
And we don't see any withered trees either, right?

54
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:37.925
The larva of the unicorn beetle

55
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:41.225
grows where fallen leaves have rot and the ground is soft.

56
00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:44.425
The stag beetle grows by withered trees.

57
00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:48.225
So there aren't much of them in groves like these where the ground is hard

58
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:51.325
and routine cleaning is carried out.

59
00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:53.625
You sure know a lot.

60
00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.525
If we were to look,

61
00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.525
it would be in the woods on the other side of our tents.

62
00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:01.025
And I think dawn would be best time to start.

63
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:04.225
Then let's eat dinner and hit the sack!

64
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:06.525
But don't expect too much.

65
00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:10.525
The collecting season is from after June until around the middle of August.

66
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.425
These days the nights are a bit chilly

67
00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:17.325
so there's not much tree sap around that the insects favour.

68
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:21.225
Don't be too disappointed.

69
00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:24.325
I have a little treasure for you instead.

70
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.325
A treasure...

71
00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:28.925
Yes. Something you will like!

72
00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:31.125
Where is it?

73
00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.225
To find it, you must...

74
00:05:40.225 --> 00:05:43.325
You will have to solve this code.

75
00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:45.225
Marumushi (pill bug)?

76
00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:46.225
Ni (and)?

77
00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.525
Tent?

78
00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:50.925
What is that?

79
00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:53.625
Pill bug is the insect that curls up into a round ball

80
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.125
when it's poked at like a roly-poly, right?

81
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:58.225
Are we going to set a tent up over him?

82
00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:00.925
Or maybe it's the ladybug?

83
00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:04.525
I don't get it.

84
00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:05.725
At times like this...

85
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:07.725
It's...

86
00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:09.825
-That's right. -Right.

87
00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:11.125
It's up to Conan.

88
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.825
What?

89
00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:16.725
No. Don't depend on Edogawa's wits.

90
00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:19.025
Why not, Haibara?

91
00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:22.425
I'm just saying it's not good to depend on others so easily.

92
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:26.225
You might be able to figure it out if you lie down and think carefully.

93
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:27.725
And if you still don't get it,

94
00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:29.925
wash your face and start anew.

95
00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.025
Start anew.

96
00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.125
It's easy to say but...

97
00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:36.425
Doc and Ai are so mean!

98
00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:40.225
-What makes you say that, Ai? -Shinichi.

99
00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:42.725
I have something I want to discuss with you.

100
00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:46.325
Can you go to the place of the code and secretly check things out?

101
00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:48.725
Okay.

102
00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:50.325
If Ai or I go,

103
00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:53.425
they'll probably find out where the coded location is through us.

104
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:05.125
Don't tell me that you can't decipher my code?

105
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.425
Leave me alone.

106
00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.425
Is that right?

107
00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.525
This is all because Ai thought it through real hard!

108
00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.325
Don't let him get you, Doc.

109
00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:18.625
Huh?

110
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:24.225
He's just trying to make you happy by making you think you beat him.

111
00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:25.425
Is that right?

112
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:32.525
It's unthinkable that he can't solve a super simple code like this.

113
00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:35.225
Isn't it right, Mr. Holmes of the age of Heisei?

114
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:39.725
She's really making me mad.

115
00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:42.625
Conan, you don't get it, too?

116
00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.725
Hey, you're just like us!

117
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.225
I'm really glad.

118
00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:49.425
You're just an ordinary first grader after all!

119
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:50.525
No.

120
00:07:50.525 --> 00:07:52.925
I almost have the answer.

121
00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:56.325
The pill bug is not an insect.

122
00:07:56.325 --> 00:08:00.225
Like the crab and shrimp, it has a hard shell.

123
00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:04.425
Just like a person who protects himself with hard frame work or cloth

124
00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:08.525
when sleeping in a tent in the mountains, so does the pill bug.

125
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.925
They can both curl up into a ball.

126
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.625
And...

127
00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:17.925
And so...

128
00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:19.125
And so...

129
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:26.825
Even if I run the common points together, I still can't solve it.

130
00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:32.525
I've got mail.

131
00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.525
Let's talk about the code later.

132
00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:37.125
Conan.

133
00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:41.725
It's from Sonoko.

134
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.125
It's a picture.

135
00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.825
What's this?

136
00:08:49.825 --> 00:08:51.325
What on earth is this?

137
00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:54.625
This time it's a phone call.

138
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:56.625
It's from Ran.

139
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:58.525
Voice changer, voice changer.

140
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:02.025
What's he doing?

141
00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:03.625
I don't know.

142
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:06.325
Ran? What's up?

143
00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.525
Sorry, Shinichi.

144
00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:11.525
Sonoko just sent you a picture, right?

145
00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:13.625
Erase it right now!

146
00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:17.125
Don't erase it!

147
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:21.625
I took Ran's special sexy shot.

148
00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:24.925
Hey, Sonoko! What are you saying?

149
00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:27.625
Special sexy shot?

150
00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:29.725
Then this is...

151
00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:33.925
Ran's...

152
00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.125
It's bleeding.

153
00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:43.925
Right, Ran and Sonoko were saying they were going to the beach.

154
00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:47.625
Hey. Who are you talking to, Conan?

155
00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:49.825
What? Conan?

156
00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:52.025
-Is Conan nearby? -Oh, no!

157
00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:56.025
Kona coffee.

158
00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:59.525
It's the kona coffee I'm drinking right now.

159
00:10:00.925 --> 00:10:04.625
Don't drink too much.

160
00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.725
Okay.

161
00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:08.025
I'm going to hang up if that's all you have to say.

162
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:11.325
The picture...

163
00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:14.025
I know! I'll erase it.

164
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:15.025
See you!

165
00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:18.225
Save, save.

166
00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:24.625
She'll find out sooner or later.

167
00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:29.825
Hey! I've found the pill bug!

168
00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:31.725
Where did you find it?

169
00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:34.425
I bet you just turned over a rock or something, right?

170
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.125
No! No!

171
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:40.625
I found it! On the other side of the woods.

172
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:41.925
You found it?

173
00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.725
Is it true, Genta?

174
00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:49.625
See, we're here.

175
00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.625
There, over there.

176
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.225
Look there!

177
00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:55.925
It's "marumushi", right?

178
00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:58.525
Marumushi Hot Spring?

179
00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:02.325
I've heard of a Asamushi Hot Spring, but...

180
00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:05.325
It's such a lonely hot spring inn.

181
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:07.525
The sign is coming off.

182
00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:11.425
There's probably a tent inside that inn, right?

183
00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:14.925
There must be a key to the code in that tent!

184
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:16.725
Then, let's go!

185
00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:21.225
Let's go!

186
00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:26.425
I don't see the point...

187
00:11:27.925 --> 00:11:30.725
of saying that so enthusiastically.

188
00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:40.647
How strange.

189
00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:45.247
I thought there was something at Marumushi Hot Spring.

190
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:48.547
That inn is closed down, and there is no tent in there.

191
00:11:48.547 --> 00:11:50.847
Yes. There was no one there, too.

192
00:11:52.747 --> 00:11:54.547
So what do you say? Give up?

193
00:11:56.847 --> 00:11:58.247
I guess so.

194
00:11:58.247 --> 00:11:59.647
Unfortunately...

195
00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:01.647
So show us the treasure.

196
00:12:01.647 --> 00:12:04.747
Actually this code is...

197
00:12:07.047 --> 00:12:08.447
Doc, wait!

198
00:12:10.347 --> 00:12:13.347
There's one person who still hasn't given up.

199
00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:21.747
Hey.

200
00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.347
Conan?

201
00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:26.047
Why don't you just give up?

202
00:12:26.047 --> 00:12:29.747
There are times like this.

203
00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:31.347
But it's so odd.

204
00:12:31.347 --> 00:12:35.347
Conan love codes so much and are able to solve them easily.

205
00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:37.647
Maybe you're suffering from the summer heat?

206
00:12:38.647 --> 00:12:40.647
Shut up.

207
00:12:41.647 --> 00:12:44.447
It's just that I can't really get into it.

208
00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:46.647
Especially when it's not connected to a case.

209
00:12:48.047 --> 00:12:49.447
A phone call.

210
00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:56.547
It's Ran again.

211
00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:02.747
What can it be this time?

212
00:13:05.147 --> 00:13:06.847
Yes, hello?

213
00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:09.447
Shinichi? Please help me!

214
00:13:10.647 --> 00:13:11.947
Someone's been killed.

215
00:13:11.947 --> 00:13:15.047
Sonoko and I were also attacked and we're in trouble!

216
00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:19.547
What? Are you in the middle of running away from the killer?

217
00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:21.847
No, we're alright now.

218
00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.147
We're not hurt.

219
00:13:23.147 --> 00:13:26.047
We're with the police right now.

220
00:13:26.047 --> 00:13:27.347
And? Who was killed?

221
00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:31.247
A man called Miyama who was staying in the same hotel as us!

222
00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:34.447
Then were you attacked because you saw the killer?

223
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.047
No, we didn't see him.

224
00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:40.947
We found out that the man was killed only after the police informed us.

225
00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:44.047
What? You were attacked despite the police being there?

226
00:13:44.047 --> 00:13:49.047
No, we were attacked on our way back from the police!

227
00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:51.447
It was too dark to see who it was though.

228
00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:53.347
Is the one who attacked you is the killer?

229
00:13:53.347 --> 00:13:54.547
I don't know.

230
00:13:54.547 --> 00:13:56.647
That person ran off with Sonoko's bag,

231
00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:58.547
-so maybe it was just a purse-snatcher. -Hey!

232
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:00.047
What are you doing?

233
00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:01.347
Give it back!

234
00:14:01.347 --> 00:14:04.747
Why did you go to the police at night?

235
00:14:04.747 --> 00:14:09.147
Sonoko remembered that there was something written on the window

236
00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:12.547
of the hotel room where the man was killed.

237
00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:15.847
So we went to the police to tell them about it.

238
00:14:15.847 --> 00:14:16.847
What kind of writing?

239
00:14:18.147 --> 00:14:20.447
Something like a code.

240
00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:21.447
A code?

241
00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:23.147
What are you so happy about?

242
00:14:23.147 --> 00:14:25.247
Someone died, you know.

243
00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:27.047
Sorry.

244
00:14:28.047 --> 00:14:30.247
And what was written?

245
00:14:31.347 --> 00:14:32.547
According to Sonoko,

246
00:14:32.547 --> 00:14:36.047
it was written in red by something similar to lipstick.

247
00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:39.247
There were four alphabets written in small letters,

248
00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:42.347
"t, e, i, u".

249
00:14:42.347 --> 00:14:44.347
"Teiu?"

250
00:14:44.347 --> 00:14:49.647
Yes. So Sonoko thinks the victim probably left a message.

251
00:14:49.647 --> 00:14:51.047
It's not probably!

252
00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:53.847
That is definitely a dying message!

253
00:14:53.847 --> 00:14:58.147
The victim probably wanted to say "teiuka".

254
00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:02.547
Sonoko.

255
00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:05.347
It is so-called...

256
00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:12.647
"The Teiuka Homicide"

257
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:18.947
What? The teiuka homicide?

258
00:15:18.947 --> 00:15:21.047
Sonoko, quit fooling around.

259
00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:23.147
I'm not fooling around!

260
00:15:23.147 --> 00:15:25.947
A man called Miyama was killed

261
00:15:25.947 --> 00:15:29.947
and on his window were the letters "teiu"!

262
00:15:29.947 --> 00:15:32.547
"T, e, i, u".

263
00:15:32.547 --> 00:15:35.447
With the letters "teiu", then it must be "teiuka"

264
00:15:35.447 --> 00:15:38.447
that he wanted to leave as a message, right?

265
00:15:38.447 --> 00:15:42.447
When we met Mr. Miyama on the beach,

266
00:15:42.447 --> 00:15:45.147
he kept using the word "teiuka".

267
00:15:45.147 --> 00:15:50.247
So whatever you say, it's the teiuka homicide.

268
00:15:50.247 --> 00:15:56.747
Was the "I" in "teiu" is the alphabet "L"?

269
00:15:56.747 --> 00:16:01.647
"L"? Well, maybe.

270
00:16:01.647 --> 00:16:04.147
So what if it is?

271
00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:05.947
And the fourth letter "u",

272
00:16:05.947 --> 00:16:09.047
wasn't the length of the right side is a little shorter than the left?

273
00:16:09.047 --> 00:16:10.047
What?

274
00:16:10.047 --> 00:16:13.347
So I'm asking if it is the "shi" character in hiragana!

275
00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:15.947
Now that you mentioned it,

276
00:16:15.947 --> 00:16:18.247
it might have been that.

277
00:16:18.247 --> 00:16:23.447
Think of the "shi" coming right after the alphabets "tel".

278
00:16:24.447 --> 00:16:27.547
Tel... tel shi?

279
00:16:27.547 --> 00:16:28.647
I get it!

280
00:16:28.647 --> 00:16:30.947
"Please tel" it means "please call",

281
00:16:30.947 --> 00:16:33.347
and he was trying to call for help.

282
00:16:33.347 --> 00:16:36.147
I knew you could do it, Shinichi!

283
00:16:36.147 --> 00:16:37.347
Yes, yes.

284
00:16:37.347 --> 00:16:40.447
Your hubby is great. Very great.

285
00:16:40.447 --> 00:16:42.047
He's not my hubby!

286
00:16:42.047 --> 00:16:44.647
What are you saying, Sonoko?

287
00:16:44.647 --> 00:16:46.547
Ran, your face are red!

288
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:49.347
In what situation was the man killed?

289
00:16:49.347 --> 00:16:50.847
Oh, right.

290
00:16:50.847 --> 00:16:52.947
According to the police,

291
00:16:52.947 --> 00:16:55.147
he was lying on the floor bleeding from his head

292
00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.947
near the window of the hotel.

293
00:16:57.947 --> 00:17:01.347
He was hit by something hard from the back.

294
00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:06.447
If he was trying to write "tel shite",

295
00:17:06.447 --> 00:17:10.247
that guy probably wrote it with his own blood.

296
00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:11.747
What?

297
00:17:11.747 --> 00:17:13.547
The letters written in red, right?

298
00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:16.447
And who found the body?

299
00:17:16.447 --> 00:17:19.747
The three friends of Mr. Miyama who was killed.

300
00:17:20.747 --> 00:17:25.347
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Kano the classmate of Mr. Miyama,

301
00:17:25.347 --> 00:17:28.447
Ms. Yanuma, Mr. Miyama's girlfriend,

302
00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:32.047
and Mr. Bito, a colleague at a part-time job they both worked for.

303
00:17:33.147 --> 00:17:35.747
Mr. Miyama and the three of them were planning to have dinner together.

304
00:17:35.747 --> 00:17:38.247
So they went to his room to get him because he didn't come.

305
00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:44.247
They found the door was unlocked and the window was broken.

306
00:17:44.247 --> 00:17:47.347
Mr. Miyama was found on the floor near the window.

307
00:17:47.347 --> 00:17:49.147
This is what they testified to the police.

308
00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:51.847
The window was broken?

309
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:58.947
That's why the police say that the killer broke in from the window.

310
00:17:58.947 --> 00:18:01.347
When Sonoko went to the police

311
00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:04.147
to tell them about the letters that were written on the window,

312
00:18:04.147 --> 00:18:08.747
they didn't find anything of that sort among the broken pieces of glass.

313
00:18:08.747 --> 00:18:14.247
The letters "teiu" were not understandable so wouldn't believe us either.

314
00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:17.147
So I told the police

315
00:18:17.147 --> 00:18:19.847
that I'd bring the evidence to them!

316
00:18:19.847 --> 00:18:21.847
Hey, Sonoko.

317
00:18:21.847 --> 00:18:23.947
Do you really have the evidence?

318
00:18:23.947 --> 00:18:26.247
Don't you remember that I sent it to you, Kudo?

319
00:18:26.247 --> 00:18:27.847
What?

320
00:18:27.847 --> 00:18:32.247
The special sexy shot of Ran that I took with my cell phone!

321
00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:35.347
I noticed the red letters before I took the picture,

322
00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:37.547
so it should be in the background of Ran's picture!

323
00:18:37.547 --> 00:18:38.947
What do you mean by "should be"?

324
00:18:38.947 --> 00:18:41.047
You haven't checked?

325
00:18:41.047 --> 00:18:45.747
No. I thought I left my cell phone back at the hotel,

326
00:18:45.747 --> 00:18:48.947
so we headed back from the police station to go get it.

327
00:18:48.947 --> 00:18:52.747
But half way back, I realize that it was in my bag.

328
00:18:52.747 --> 00:18:55.547
So we were heading back to the police station again

329
00:18:55.547 --> 00:18:57.247
when I was unfortunately mugged

330
00:18:57.247 --> 00:18:59.347
and my bag was taken.

331
00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.847
I didn't want to be called a liar

332
00:19:01.847 --> 00:19:07.547
so I told Ran to call you and ask you to send me back that picture!

333
00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:08.747
Huh?

334
00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.747
I told her that you probably erased it,

335
00:19:10.747 --> 00:19:13.447
and that it would be no use to call you.

336
00:19:13.447 --> 00:19:14.947
You erased it, right?

337
00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:17.947
Yes, of course.

338
00:19:17.947 --> 00:19:19.347
You see!

339
00:19:19.347 --> 00:19:21.047
Really?

340
00:19:21.047 --> 00:19:22.447
Anyway,

341
00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:24.647
you know the meaning of the letters now,

342
00:19:24.647 --> 00:19:26.647
so go tell the police about it.

343
00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:30.247
Okay! I'll call if something comes up.

344
00:19:30.247 --> 00:19:32.147
Okay.

345
00:19:32.147 --> 00:19:35.947
That sexy shot... Did he really erased it?

346
00:19:35.947 --> 00:19:39.947
Picture, picture.

347
00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:40.947
Found it.

348
00:19:40.947 --> 00:19:43.047
There's the red letters.

349
00:19:44.947 --> 00:19:48.647
There's something written on the window just like Sonoko said.

350
00:19:48.647 --> 00:19:52.647
The curtain is closed so it's not possible to look inside the room.

351
00:19:52.647 --> 00:19:55.347
Only the letter "t" which is hidden behind Ran's hips is in view.

352
00:19:58.047 --> 00:20:01.247
There's something written in red besides the "t".

353
00:20:01.247 --> 00:20:04.247
Could it be a comma or a slip of the pen?

354
00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:06.947
What a weird killer

355
00:20:06.947 --> 00:20:09.847
if the dying message were to be "tel shite".

356
00:20:09.847 --> 00:20:11.647
Some time after committing the murder,

357
00:20:11.647 --> 00:20:13.147
he must've noticed the writing

358
00:20:13.147 --> 00:20:16.947
and broke the window to retrieve the pieces with writings on them.

359
00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:19.547
Even if it were to be an attempt to delay the discovery of the body,

360
00:20:19.547 --> 00:20:21.747
breaking the window would risk attracting more attention

361
00:20:21.747 --> 00:20:24.747
and hastening the discovery.

362
00:20:24.747 --> 00:20:28.547
What are you looking at, Conan?

363
00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:30.147
What?

364
00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:31.847
What is it?

365
00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:35.647
Hey! That's... It's a woman's nude, isn't it?

366
00:20:37.247 --> 00:20:41.047
Conan, it might be against the law

367
00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:43.747
if a grade schooler looks at a picture like that!

368
00:20:43.747 --> 00:20:45.147
It's not.

369
00:20:47.647 --> 00:20:49.647
It's just a spam mail.

370
00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:52.747
When I accessed the site to the mail,

371
00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:55.647
I just happened to get this picture.

372
00:20:55.647 --> 00:20:58.947
By the way, were you guys able to decipher Doc's code?

373
00:20:58.947 --> 00:21:01.347
No. Not at all.

374
00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:03.547
No way!

375
00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:05.947
If even you can't, how could we?

376
00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:12.347
We borrowed the paper with the code "pill bug and a tent".

377
00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:13.847
Pill bug...

378
00:21:13.847 --> 00:21:15.647
I wonder if we'll really be able to find the site of the treasure

379
00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:18.047
after deciphering this code?

380
00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:19.847
If I were to choose,

381
00:21:19.847 --> 00:21:24.247
I would rather have come here for the festival Dr. Agasa went to.

382
00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:26.247
Festival?

383
00:21:26.247 --> 00:21:30.947
Wasn't that festival called the Tento Festival?

384
00:21:30.947 --> 00:21:31.947
What?

385
00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:33.747
What did you just say?

386
00:21:33.747 --> 00:21:37.547
You can see the shrine gate that lit up, right?

387
00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:41.547
Doc said that it's a village festival and the float starts from there.

388
00:21:42.647 --> 00:21:47.647
Then, is the "tent" in the code points to the Tento festival?

389
00:21:47.647 --> 00:21:51.647
Even so, I still don't understand the pill bug part.

390
00:21:51.647 --> 00:21:56.347
I still think it has something to do with the Marumushi Hot Spring.

391
00:21:56.347 --> 00:21:58.847
But that place was closed down.

392
00:21:59.847 --> 00:22:01.847
The entrance was closed

393
00:22:01.847 --> 00:22:04.547
and no one answered our calls.

394
00:22:05.947 --> 00:22:07.047
What is it?

395
00:22:07.047 --> 00:22:11.147
Hey, look! Something's getting bright.

396
00:22:11.147 --> 00:22:13.247
That's where...

397
00:22:13.247 --> 00:22:15.647
Marumushi Hot Spring is located.

398
00:22:16.647 --> 00:22:18.847
"Pill bug and tent..."

399
00:22:18.847 --> 00:22:20.747
Does that mean to light it up?

400
00:22:20.747 --> 00:22:23.847
That's it! That must be it!

401
00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:25.647
I'm getting it.

402
00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:27.047
Okay!

403
00:22:27.047 --> 00:22:28.947
Let's go!

404
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:01.547
"Next Episode" -We give up, right?

405
00:24:01.547 --> 00:24:04.947
You guys give up too easily.

406
00:24:04.947 --> 00:24:08.047
First, all these codes are written only in Katakana.

407
00:24:08.047 --> 00:24:12.247
Secondly, if you look closely, the letters are not balanced.

408
00:24:12.247 --> 00:24:14.247
And thirdly,

409
00:24:14.247 --> 00:24:16.447
the hint Dr and Haibara was talking about.

410
00:24:17.447 --> 00:24:18.747
Wait a minute.

411
00:24:18.747 --> 00:24:20.647
This is...

412
00:24:20.647 --> 00:24:23.547
Darn it! I should've realized this earlier.

413
00:24:23.547 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 2)"

414
00:24:30.474 --> 00:24:32.974
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:32.974 --> 00:24:34.674
"Back and front"

416
00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:36.374
Words that can be read from right to left!

417
00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:37.374
Deed.

418
00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:39.374
-Great! -Ear.
