1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,440
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,240
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,140
The unlucky day calendar is a point of concern.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,840
An apparition is created from a nightmare.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
Homicide despite tight security.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,245
Evil spirit?

10
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:48,245
You're asking me to get rid of the curse of an evil spirit?

11
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:51,945
Yes. Well, to put it straightforwardly...

12
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,945
You see, a detective solves cases.

13
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:57,645
Of course,

14
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:01,045
we've asked priests and clairvoyants to try and perform exorcisms,

15
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,845
but nothing seems to be working so far.

16
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:06,245
So we have gone for the last resort, the Mouri Detective Agency

17
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,745
in hopes that you may be able

18
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:10,745
to solve this paranormal phenomena scientifically.

19
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:13,645
And? Just what is that paranormal phenomenon?

20
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,345
It all started with a nightmare

21
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,345
that the master of the house had seen two years ago.

22
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:19,645
A nightmare?

23
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:21,245
He jumped up from bed

24
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,945
screaming in a chilling voice that wasn't from this world.

25
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:23,945
And when I opened the door,

26
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,945
he said, "It's a curse. I'm going to be killed."

27
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,445
He keeps on repeating those words again and again.

28
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:31,145
But that was only a dream, right?

29
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:34,045
Of course, that's not the only thing!

30
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:38,745
Six months after that, the brakes of this car that the master was riding

31
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:41,445
went out of control and he barely escaped a big accident.

32
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:44,145
Isn't it right, Mr. Watabiki? You remember it, don't you?

33
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:49,145
Yes. I didn't realize that the brake oil was leaking.

34
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,245
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:55,245
Because of that accident, the master came down with a heart ailment.

36
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:58,545
His eye became sunken and his hair turned completely white.

37
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,345
But it can also be considered a mere accident.

38
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:04,345
In what way is an evil spirit involved?

39
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:07,345
We can't help but think it's the doings of an evil spirit.

40
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,545
With this kind of card being sent to us.

41
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,345
Card?

42
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:19,145
"Atone your sins before I shall awaken. I am the fifth soul."

43
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:26,245
"The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (The Case)"

44
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,945
And when did you get this card?

45
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,045
Around a little after New Year's Day last year.

46
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,645
It was in the mailbox.

47
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:37,045
At first, we thought it was just a prank,

48
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:42,045
but when I showed it to the master, his wife was also very surprised.

49
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:44,445
-His wife was also surprised? -Yes.

50
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:49,345
Then six months later, the dish cabinet suddenly toppled over.

51
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,845
Furthermore in April of this year,

52
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,045
a strange sound was heard from inside the house

53
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,845
where only the master and his wife were supposed to be.

54
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:59,845
Was there something in common about the days when strange things happened?

55
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:03,545
Like things always happened on Friday the 13th or something like that.

56
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,145
No.

57
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,845
The days were at random,

58
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,845
but the date was always on the 4th.

59
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:13,845
Then maybe something happened on the 4th previously?

60
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:18,145
But no one has any idea.

61
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:21,945
Today is October 3rd,

62
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:24,645
so tomorrow is the problem date, the 4th.

63
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,845
That's true.

64
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:33,145
It seems that strange things happened five times so far.

65
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,945
Do you remember what year and what month it was?

66
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:38,545
No, I don't.

67
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,045
I do!

68
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,245
At first,

69
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:49,245
two years ago on February 4th, the master had a nightmare.

70
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,345
Then he got into an accident in the same year on July 4th.

71
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:56,345
A year ago, on February 4th, a strange card was found in the mailbox

72
00:04:56,345 --> 00:05:00,045
and on July 4th the same year, the dish cabinet fell.

73
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:04,045
On April 4th this year, a strange sound was heard from inside the house.

74
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,845
You've taken notes of everything!

75
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:11,845
Yes. I have to write things down because I'm so forgetful.

76
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,445
He's just like you, Conan.

77
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,645
Right.

78
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:24,845
Maybe the sender of this card is up to something.

79
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:28,545
By the way, don't you sense anything about this card?

80
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,745
Sense something? You mean like something spiritual?

81
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,645
Well, you know...

82
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:37,145
Well, if you don't sense anything...

83
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:43,745
I heard differently!

84
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,245
I thought we were going to have just one guest?

85
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:51,645
I'm sorry. My daughter insisted on coming so.

86
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,145
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,145
No, I'm not angry at you people!

88
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:59,645
I'm angry at this old man here who didn't bother to contact me!

89
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:01,445
Old man...

90
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,945
Namika.

91
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,345
I've got to go and shop for more stuff then.

92
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:08,545
You sure have a perky daughter.

93
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:11,145
No. She's the chef.

94
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,245
Chef?

95
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:17,445
Her father used to be the chef for the Kunitomo family.

96
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:21,445
But he died of an accident and she succeeded him.

97
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:24,045
She's still so young.

98
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:28,345
Come to think of it, he also took after his father.

99
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,945
That's right, Mr. Watabiki!

100
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:34,845
The master will be going to the University Hospital at 20:00 tonight.

101
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,745
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,445
Huh?

103
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,145
Out of ink?

104
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:42,145
Here!

105
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,045
Use this.

106
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,845
Thank you.

107
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,645
I'm sorry. Please don't be offended.

108
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:01,045
I experienced food poisoning when I was a child.

109
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,745
And since then I've become a neat paranoiac.

110
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,645
Here you go. Thank you.

111
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:09,345
Okay.

112
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,245
Conan?

113
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,445
We're going to leave you behind.

114
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:16,045
Leave him! Leave him!

115
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,045
The master and his wife?

116
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,845
I saw them a while ago in the third floor bedroom.

117
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:24,545
Okay.

118
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,845
Huh?

119
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,245
What is it?

120
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:29,945
You sure look like the chef we saw a while ago.

121
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,445
It hurts!

122
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:33,045
Dad!

123
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,045
Of course we look alike!

124
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:38,045
Namika is my daughter.

125
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,945
No wonder.

126
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:42,645
And please don't point your finger at me, okay?

127
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,945
I have belonephobia.

128
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,745
I see.

129
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,045
Belonephobia?

130
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,945
Dad.

131
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:56,945
If you have a message for the master, shall I go relay it for you?

132
00:07:56,945 --> 00:08:00,045
No. I'll go see him myself.

133
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,645
By the way, Shigeko. That picture...

134
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:06,645
Will you please fix it in place?

135
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:11,045
I think it is about five millimetres tilted to the right.

136
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:14,945
Huh?

137
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:16,845
Five millimetres?

138
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:19,045
Yes, sir!

139
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,545
Thank you.

140
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:23,345
Shall we go, then?

141
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:37,245
What a strange place for a door to be.

142
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:38,945
Oh, that's the door

143
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:41,045
that a friend of Mrs. Kunitomo installed

144
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:44,645
after they received that weird card.

145
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:47,445
It's quite some door.

146
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:54,445
You push the passcode like so and place your index finger here.

147
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,645
Who is it?

148
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,845
I'm Akatsuka, the steward.

149
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:06,845
I've brought Detective Mouri with me.

150
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,945
I'll open the door right away.

151
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,145
Like so.

152
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,245
Fantastic!

153
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,745
It's made so that the bell doesn't ring inside

154
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:22,045
unless it's the registered fingerprints of a family member.

155
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,145
It's just like some science fiction movie.

156
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:26,445
It's not science fiction at all.

157
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:34,745
There are condos equipped with fingerprint recognition machines nowadays.

158
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:38,245
Although it's not that all widespread yet.

159
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,245
Right.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,745
This is Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo, and the person to the left

161
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:47,345
is the person who made the door, Mrs. Kunitomo's friend, Mr. Sekiguchi.

162
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:51,945
It seems that someone who was inside opened this door a while ago,

163
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:54,445
but what if nobody is on the third floor either?

164
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,145
No one can open the door.

165
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,845
Except for my husband whose fingerprints

166
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,645
are set inside the fingerprint recognition machine.

167
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,745
Anyone in this house can go out

168
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,945
by placing his finger on the machine though.

169
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,045
I'd like to give it a try.

170
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:09,445
Don't touch it!

171
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,545
When someone from outside places his finger on the machine,

172
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,245
the alarm within the house will go off

173
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,345
and the people from the security office will rush over here!

174
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,345
It hurts.

175
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:22,545
I also thought that we should put up surveillance cameras too, but...

176
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,945
I told him not to do it.

177
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,845
A camera at the front entrance is okay,

178
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,145
but I'm setting up such exaggerated security precautions

179
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:34,045
in this fine house that my father had built.

180
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:36,945
I think it has enough exaggerated security precautions already.

181
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:40,645
You're Mr. Mouri, the renown detective!

182
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,645
Yes.

183
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:47,145
I'm Kunitomo, the one who asked for you.

184
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,345
It hurts...

185
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,045
I'm counting on you as far as the investigation is concerned.

186
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:52,145
Yes, sir.

187
00:10:56,745 --> 00:11:00,245
I shall give you a quick tour of the house then.

188
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,645
Thank you.

189
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:06,745
Kid, hurry up!

190
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:08,445
Okay!

191
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:17,945
Are you sure it's okay calling a detective over?

192
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,445
If he finds out about the, you know what...

193
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:24,945
He won't. There's no evidence of it anywhere anymore.

194
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,945
But from what was written on that card...

195
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,545
That's why we hired a detective.

196
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:33,645
To have him catch the one who is blackmailing us

197
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:36,345
and find out how far he knows, right?

198
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,845
Wait! I'll go get your medicine right away.

199
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,045
Here, your medicine!

200
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,845
Hey, are you okay?

201
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,045
At the rate you're going,

202
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,845
you're going to drop dead before we catch the culprit.

203
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,045
Watch your mouth!

204
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,945
You're the one to blame for what happened to begin with, you know!

205
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:03,845
That's why I'm here, aren't I?

206
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:06,545
Tomorrow's the X Day in question, right?

207
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:07,745
Yes.

208
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:11,645
The day that this mansion's mouse begins to move.

209
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,925
And?

210
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,425
How is it?

211
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,125
How?

212
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,325
It's good of course.

213
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,225
Oh, no. I'm not talking about the food,

214
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:47,025
but the investigation.

215
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,425
I can't say yet, for now.

216
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:57,025
Even if someone were to set it up,

217
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,325
so that the dish cabinet would fall or queer sounds would be made,

218
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,725
I'm sure the gadgets would've been retrieved by now.

219
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:04,125
Not again!

220
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,325
Wearing gloves when eating.

221
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:08,825
Everything's washed clean. How rude!

222
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,125
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,025
It's about time I take the master to the hospital.

224
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:17,425
Why don't you at least drink your coffee before you go?

225
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,025
Those two get along well, don't they?

226
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,825
Yes. Their parents were best friends and they're childhood friends.

227
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,625
Excuse me. Could I have some coffee, too?

228
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,925
Here.

229
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:36,525
Huh?

230
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,925
Here, give it to me.

231
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,425
I'm sorry, mother.

232
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:45,525
She's acrophobic,

233
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,525
so she can't go near a window that's more than second floors high.

234
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:53,525
By the way, that steward is a meticulous perfectionist

235
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,825
and hates things that are crooked.

236
00:13:55,825 --> 00:14:00,125
Even if it's a tablecloth, if he finds that it's crooked...

237
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,425
See!

238
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:07,225
What is wrong with this house?

239
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:14,025
Neat paranoiac, onephobia, acrophobe, and a meticulous perfectionist.

240
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,325
I took the job only because

241
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:21,825
I thought we could spend the night at the mansion of a tycoon in Shizuoka.

242
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,625
Conan, we should've stayed home

243
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,325
if this kind of spook story was going to come up, right?

244
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,125
What're you looking at?

245
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,525
Oh, well...

246
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,925
The dates of the five incidents that happened here.

247
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,725
The first one was two years ago on February 4th.

248
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,625
The next one was on July 4th.

249
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,425
Last year, it also happened on February 4th and July 4th.

250
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:43,225
And this year, it's April the 4th, right?

251
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,725
I wonder why it's April 4th only this year?

252
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,825
Beats me. If it's the 5th,

253
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:53,025
Dad was out on February 5th and July 5th last year and two years ago.

254
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,025
Huh?

255
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,225
Don't you remember? You went to a wedding, helped people move

256
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:59,225
and went on a trip with the community committee.

257
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,225
Come to think of it,

258
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:03,225
I went to a wedding on the 5th of April this year, too.

259
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:08,425
A lucky day is usually chosen for weddings, trips and moving, right?

260
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,125
Yes.

261
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,325
Right.

262
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:15,625
Which means the day before those days are all Butsumetsu?

263
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,925
Butsumetsu?

264
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,325
Wait!

265
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:20,825
If I remember correctly, the supermarket

266
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:24,025
will be having a grand opening on October 5th, the day after tomorrow.

267
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,625
So what does that mean?

268
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,225
Does that mean that tomorrow, October the 4th is Butsumetsu

269
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:29,725
and something's going to happen?

270
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:32,025
To be exact, it's already today.

271
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:35,325
What was that?

272
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,925
What was that sound?

273
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:43,925
A shoe?

274
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,525
Mr. Akatsuka? This is Yasue.

275
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,625
We got a flat tire so we were a bit stalled.

276
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,825
We're late, but we should be arriving there soon.

277
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:24,725
What? Mr. Sekiguchi?

278
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:29,225
Yes. On the veranda where your bedroom is.

279
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,825
We called the ambulance and the police right away,

280
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,525
but the only person who can enter the third floor is Mr. Kunitomo,

281
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,625
so no one has gone in yet.

282
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,325
Please hurry back!

283
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,925
What on earth is going on?

284
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:45,925
It's a curse. It's an evil spirit after all.

285
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,225
Dear?

286
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,725
Here is your medicine!

287
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,325
Mr. Watabiki, please hurry!

288
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:58,225
Yes! I'll try my best.

289
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,025
The victim is Mr. Toshimichi Sekiguchi, age 43.

290
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:13,125
The estimated time of death is 4 hours ago between 20:30 to 21:00.

291
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,925
Mr. Sekiguchi was your friend, Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo.

292
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:22,025
Yes. We were classmates in high school.

293
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,325
He is the president of a security company now.

294
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,525
Which means that the fingerprint recognition device installed

295
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,525
at the entrance of the third floor was put there by Mr. Sekiguchi, right?

296
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:32,925
Yes.

297
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:37,925
Would you please tell me where you were between 20:30 and 21:00?

298
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,625
I was in the car. On my way to the hospital with my husband.

299
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,025
My husband has a heart ailment so on the 3rd of every month,

300
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:49,625
we go to doctor acquaintance of ours to have him checked.

301
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,325
What time did you leave the house?

302
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:53,825
I think it was just about 20:00.

303
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,325
Are you suspecting us?

304
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:02,525
I'm sure that Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo left here at 20:00!

305
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,825
I see.

306
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,625
I came here to the 3rd floor

307
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:12,125
at 5 minutes to 20:00 in order to take the two to the car.

308
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,925
Besides, at that time, Mr. Sekiguchi was alive.

309
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,425
I see.

310
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:24,725
Could Mr. Sekiguchi have committed suicide?

311
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:29,325
Well, there are some queer points as to his death.

312
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,225
The position of the rope that he put his neck through

313
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:35,525
is much too close to the railing of the veranda!

314
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,825
Well, he could've done so even if he was close.

315
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,625
But he would've had an extremely difficult time doing so.

316
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:45,625
So this may be homicide made to look like a suicide.

317
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,525
Well, we can't tell whether it's suicide or homicide yet, but...

318
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:53,725
This card that reads, "I atone my sins of 13 years ago"

319
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:56,825
is sure to be the key to solving the case.

320
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:59,825
Mr. Mouri, where did you get that?

321
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:05,325
I found it in Mr. Sekiguchi's clothes before the police got here.

322
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:08,925
You shouldn't do stuff like that on your own.

323
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,225
Right, that's why I gave him a good licking.

324
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,225
Huh?

325
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:16,325
Isn't that right, kid?

326
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:19,325
What is this card anyway?

327
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,325
A sin of 13 years ago?

328
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,725
Beats me.

329
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:26,225
It kind of looks to be a dying message, too.

330
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,625
But I guess we can ask the three who went pale

331
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,225
when they saw this card for the details?

332
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,925
What seems to be the matter?

333
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,925
Does something 13 years ago come to mind?

334
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,525
It was just about 13 years ago.

335
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:47,525
The master's cruiser had a marine accident.

336
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,125
Marine accident?

337
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:53,825
Yes. Back then, every year, just about this time,

338
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:59,225
it was usual practice for all of us here to go cruising on master's boat,

339
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,225
but it got stranded off shore the Suruga Bay.

340
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:02,525
Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo

341
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,825
and Mr. Sekiguchi who just happened to be sailing that day

342
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:07,125
somehow made it to safety.

343
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,825
And what about the others?

344
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:13,525
The whereabouts of everyone else is unknown.

345
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,425
The ship that sunk hasn't been found yet either.

346
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:21,325
Could it be that Mr. Sekuguchi caused the ship to sink

347
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:24,125
so someone had a grudge against him?

348
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,825
Well, I hate the sea.

349
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,625
So I never went with them.

350
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,825
Since you two were saved, you know what happened, don't you?

351
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,125
The reason why the ship sank.

352
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,025
No. Because I was sleeping

353
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:42,325
when Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly shouted to run for it.

354
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,325
We were desperate to flee that we didn't know what was going on.

355
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,725
Is there anybody here that is the bereaved family of a victim

356
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,525
of that accident and working here?

357
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,225
Yes.

358
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:56,225
Which means that this case may also be connected

359
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:59,425
in some way to the five others incidents that happened here.

360
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,125
Five incidents?

361
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,125
It happened.

362
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,525
Mr. Kunitomo had nightmares.

363
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:08,925
The car brakes didn't function.

364
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,025
The dish cabinet falls down in the middle of the night

365
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,625
And strange sounds are heard

366
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,325
at a place where no one is supposed to be there.

367
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:23,325
And to top things off is this card that was found directly in the mailbox.

368
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,525
Please wait a minute.

369
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:30,825
It looks exactly like the card that was found in on Mr. Sekiguchi.

370
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:35,225
Moreover, if all the incidents are happening on "Butsumetsu the 4th",

371
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:37,925
it's natural to think that someone in this house

372
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:40,825
is up to something, isn't it?

373
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:44,525
I see. Someone who is still working here

374
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:48,125
and is a bereaved family member of the victim of the accident.

375
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,625
That person may have thought

376
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,025
that Mr. Sekiguchi was responsible for the accident and killed him.

377
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:58,825
So please call the people who fit in to this category here.

378
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,825
Yes, sir.

379
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:04,025
Mr. Sekiguchi's wristwatch...

380
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,725
Something's engraved on it.

381
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,225
"E" and "N"?

382
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,925
"E" and "N" would usually mean...

383
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:15,025
Huh? Maybe not...

384
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:16,525
Which means...

385
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,325
"Next Episode"

386
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:51,025
This is absurd!

387
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:54,125
The thing that bothers me is that rope.

388
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,225
If my deduction is correct...

389
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,925
Mrs. Kunitomo!

390
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:01,125
It's a curse after all.

391
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,625
I'm sure Mr. Kunitomo also saw that ghost!

392
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:07,525
Hurry up and open the door!

393
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,425
Intruder!

394
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:16,325
Next Conan, "The Evil Spirit that Appears on Butsumetsu (Suspicion)"

395
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,552
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:21,352
"Fingerprint"

397
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:23,352
-Conan, show me your fingerprint. -Okay.

398
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:24,852
Your fingerprint is just like Shinichi's.

399
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,256
Surprised?
