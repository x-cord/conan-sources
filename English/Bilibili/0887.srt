1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,840
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,340
Word on the street is the sandwiches

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,740
that waiter at Poirot makes are pretty good.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,240
So this year,

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
I'll present my meat and potatoes to the world,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,140
sell a boatload, and make fistfuls of money.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,740
Boatloads and fistfuls...

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,940
Once again...

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,640
We appreciate your continued support in 2018!

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,540
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,340
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,840
It's been a while! Happy New Year!

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,440
I'll be keeping you in check again this year!

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,640
His name is Detective Conan.

17
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,840
"Thief Kid and the Trick Box (Part 1)"

18
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,640
So this is "Mokujin",

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,940
the trick box made by

20
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,240
mid-19th Century tinkerer Kichiemon Samizu.

21
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm delighted you're giving me this,

22
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,840
in addition to all those valuable books.

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,540
No, I'm not giving you the box.

24
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,840
"Tomoyose Kimika (70), widow" -I want you to open it.

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,740
My husband, who passed away last month,

26
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,440
left something important to me inside that box.

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,440
I see.

28
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,540
Apparently, my husband stuck the instructions

29
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,340
to open the box inside a book.

30
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,740
I'd like you to find that paper

31
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,140
within the books I've given to you.

32
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,540
I see.

33
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,740
So, what's inside the box?

34
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,740
The world's largest moonstone, "Luna Memoria".

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,940
Yes.

36
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,340
It's exactly the kind of thing that Moonlight Magician goes after.

37
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,340
A big jewel.

38
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,440
"To Thief Kid,

39
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,340
tonight the world's largest moonstone, Luna Memoria,

40
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,040
will be on display at the Suzuki Library.

41
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,240
The jewel is inside a trick box made by Kichiemon Samizu.

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,840
If you want to see it, you'll either have to open the box yourself,

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
or find the written instructions in the library."

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,840
General Adviser to the Suzuki Conglomerate, Jirokichi Suzuki.

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Gosh.

46
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,440
That old man is up to his old tricks again.

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,040
If you're going, you'd better hurry up.

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,240
You've been invited, too, right?

49
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
After all, you're the Kid Killer.

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,940
Yeah. I just got a message from Ran.

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,540
Wait. What do you mean by "too"?

52
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,940
I've been invited by the general adviser as well.

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,740
Since I'm a professional tinkerer,

54
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,940
he's asked me to open the box before Thief Kid arrives.

55
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,840
I doubt you'd be able to open a Kichiemon Samizu trick box.

56
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,940
What? Ai.

57
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,540
Kichiemon Samizu?

58
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,040
Sounds interesting.

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,540
Subaru.

60
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,040
I was told last time that the vegetables weren't cooked enough.

61
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,540
So I came to share some of this thoroughly

62
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,240
stewed meat and potatoes I made.

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,940
What? You want to go, too?

64
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,340
No. I'll leave this here and go.

65
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm not interested in thieves.

66
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,940
Though I do have some interest

67
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,240
in those who take lives rather than things.

68
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,540
Gosh. He's always wearing those turtlenecks.

69
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,340
What's his deal?

70
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,740
Maybe he gets cold easily.

71
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,840
Turtlenecks are just about the only thing

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,640
that cover his choker-shaped voice changer.

73
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,240
"Kudo"

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Dr. Agasa, what are you doing?

75
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,840
Sorry, sorry. I couldn't find my license.

76
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
"Suzuki Library"

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,940
Ran!

78
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,340
You're late.

79
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,840
The kids are already here.

80
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
Sorry, sorry.

81
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,840
Dad caught a cold.

82
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,740
We had to stop at the hospital.

83
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,340
Is he okay?

84
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,140
I told him he didn't have to come.

85
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,240
It's just a head cold.

86
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
How could I not come

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
afer he offered me front row tickets to an Yoko Okino concert?

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,740
Will you even be helpful in your condition?

89
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,840
He always comes through at the critical moment.

90
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,040
Yeah, right. I actually made it easier for Thief Kid to sneak in.

91
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,440
How do front row tickets sound?

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll be there!

93
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
By inviting more people for him to disguise himself as.

94
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Detective Mouri, thank you for coming.

95
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,340
Come in and examine

96
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,940
the trick box for yourself.

97
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,140
Don't worry.

98
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,540
Inspector Nakamori and I have agreed that

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,540
he won't pinch any faces,

100
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,940
and that the police will wait outside.

101
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,540
What?

102
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
The inspector's not going inside?

103
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,940
Then there's no point in disguising myself as him.

104
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,440
In that case...

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,140
My mother said to pick...

106
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,940
The very best one and you are it.

107
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
I see.

108
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
So this is the trick box.

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,640
It's supposed to open when you push or pull a certain part.

110
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,740
It looks like an ordinary box to me.

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,840
I'll force it open!

112
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Don't!

113
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,540
It hurts!

114
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
"Punished"

115
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,640
I wouldn't expect any less from Kichiemon Samizu.

116
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,540
It's like a mini Iron Tanuki.

117
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,340
What is that thing?

118
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,040
It shoots out needles if you're careless with it.

119
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,940
I got these when I touched it earlier.

120
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,040
Then why don't we put it in a vice and cut it open?

121
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,640
It's just made of wood.

122
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,240
You mustn't.

123
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,540
That was made by the famous tinkerer Kichiemon Samizu.

124
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,440
The box itself is worth as much as the moonstone inside it.

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,840
But I thought moonstones weren't that valuable.

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,840
I see them going for about ten thousand yen online all the time.

127
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
What are you talking about?

128
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,140
My husband went all the way

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,740
to the source in Sri Lanka to buy the one in the box.

130
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,840
Its beautiful moonlight blue luster is a true example of...

131
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Adularescence.

132
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,140
Moonstones that produce that optical phenomenon

133
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,840
are valuable.

134
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,140
Furthermore, at that size,

135
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,340
it may truly be as valuable as a Kichiemon Samizu trick box.

136
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,340
I thought you weren't interested.

137
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,840
My curiosity got the better of me.

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm surprised you got in.

139
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,340
When I told them I knew Dr. Agasa,

140
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,640
they let me in without searching me.

141
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,340
That's how we're doing things this time.

142
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,040
We're turning away obvious Thief Kid fans,

143
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,640
but we're letting in the general public.

144
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,940
We're also leaving the box on this table

145
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,640
without any guards posted.

146
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,440
Won't he run away with the box?

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,340
Don't worry.

148
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,740
When I push this switch,

149
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,240
the scale embedded in the floor activates.

150
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,340
If the weight removed by a person leaving

151
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,640
is even a gram off

152
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,040
from the weight added when they entered...

153
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,140
This happens.

154
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,740
How very Kichiemon Samizu-esque.

155
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,540
Naturally, if he quietly opens the box

156
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,040
and attempts to take just the jewel inside,

157
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,540
the same thing will happen.

158
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,740
He won't be able to open it quietly.

159
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,940
When the box is opened, the music box inside it

160
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,540
plays a beautiful melody.

161
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,340
I heard a music box playing in the middle of the night,

162
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,040
and found my husband in the study opening the box,

163
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
admiring the contents,

164
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,640
and then winding the key before putting it back together.

165
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,940
What song does it play?

166
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,940
The last time my husband opened the box

167
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,640
was more than a decade ago.

168
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
I can't remember.

169
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,540
It's a famous melody everyone knows.

170
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,940
I think it may have been a nursery song or something similar.

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,140
Even if he slips through the bars

172
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,240
with the box and jewel,

173
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,740
the steel shutters installed at every exit

174
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,040
are programmed to shut along with the cage.

175
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,140
No one will be able to escape.

176
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,640
I see.

177
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,840
So she wants to open the box no matter what.

178
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Even if it means getting help from Thief Kid.

179
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,740
So, where are the written instructions for opening the box?

180
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,840
After my husband closed the box,

181
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,440
I saw him putting a piece of paper with a diagram of the box

182
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,140
with arrows and numbers inside a book.

183
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,840
Later my husband found me searching the study for that book.

184
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,240
Oh, my.

185
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,640
So you saw me opening the trick box.

186
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,140
But you won't be able to find it.

187
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
What?

188
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,940
Not that paper or the contents of the box.

189
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,940
That's what he said, so I assume the instructions

190
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,740
to open the box were written on that paper.

191
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,340
Why did your husband hide that jewel from you?

192
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,740
Who knows?

193
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,840
My husband was a very shy man.

194
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,140
What?

195
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,440
Oh, that is,

196
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,040
moonstones are said to bring about love.

197
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,540
Perhaps he didn't want me to see him

198
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,440
so carefully keeping such a stone.

199
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,540
Her husband was one of my adventuring friends.

200
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,840
He certainly was a shy man.

201
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,540
When we circled the world in our man-powered plane,

202
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,340
he hid behind me when the media came to take photos of us.

203
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,940
So, has Thief Kid told you he's coming?

204
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,340
Yes. We just received a message reading,

205
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,140
"As the moonlit magician,

206
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,440
I swear on my title that I will come for the moonstone."

207
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,340
Which means in order to open the box before Thief Kid,

208
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,640
instead of blindly fiddling with the box,

209
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,040
it would be faster to find the book

210
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
containing the written instructions to open it.

211
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,640
All the books in the study were donated to the library.

212
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
I keep them here in this room.

213
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Then if we split up and search for...

214
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,240
What?

215
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,640
Wait...

216
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,240
Seriously?

217
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,540
All of these?

218
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,540
There's about ten thousand of them.

219
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
It's worth finding, don't you think?

220
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,440
This is way too many.

221
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,607
Ten thousand?

222
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,607
This is just like the study at Shinichi's house.

223
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,307
You're right.

224
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:27,407
But the instructions to open that box

225
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:32,307
are inside one of these books, right?

226
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,407
How are we supposed to find it?

227
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,407
There.

228
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:42,507
We'll have to search each one.

229
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:47,507
Gosh. I wish you'd done this before we arrived.

230
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:52,007
I had my entire staff spend a whole day searching,

231
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,107
but they didn't find the paper.

232
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:55,207
What?

233
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,107
Though since there's ten thousand books,

234
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,707
instead of reading each individual page,

235
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:06,907
they flipped through them like you're doing now.

236
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:12,207
Normally if there's something stuck between the pages,

237
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:15,407
the books should open right to it.

238
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:20,007
Is it possible your husband hid the paper somewhere else?

239
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,907
No.

240
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:24,607
My husband died last month

241
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,007
in an unfortunate traffic accident.

242
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:31,107
He couldn't have foreseen that and hidden the paper elsewhere.

243
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:36,607
But your husband hasn't open the box in ten years, right?

244
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,307
Not that I saw.

245
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:44,007
Apparently, he secretly opened it while I was out.

246
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:47,107
When I returned,

247
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,807
he would always say the same thing.

248
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:54,307
Looks like you still haven't opened the box.

249
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:55,407
What?

250
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:59,807
The instructions were still in the same place.

251
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:02,807
If you're able to find that paper,

252
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:06,807
you should be able to find the true contents of the box.

253
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:11,007
I guess this was too much for you.

254
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:13,707
But if you insist,

255
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:16,507
I'll show you where the page is hidden.

256
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,907
It's a bit embarrassing, though.

257
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,907
Is what he'd say.

258
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,507
The true contents?

259
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:27,807
Does that mean there's something inside the box

260
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,207
besides the moonstone?

261
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,007
I... I'm not sure.

262
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:35,307
I've never opened it, so I have no idea.

263
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:39,107
If he said he'd tell you,

264
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:42,507
you should've asked him which book it was.

265
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,907
I was frustrated.

266
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:49,007
He made it sound as though I'd never find it.

267
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:52,507
Did you search for the paper after that?

268
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:56,107
Yes, while my husband was out.

269
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:59,407
In the end, I never found it.

270
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:03,307
Then maybe it's in a book

271
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:04,907
you wouldn't normally read.

272
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:07,007
You're right.

273
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,907
I tend not to read

274
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:15,807
murder mysteries or monster stories.

275
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:20,007
Those books are kept around there.

276
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:22,507
Then we'll start there.

277
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,607
Before we start searching, why don't you go to the bathroom

278
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:33,007
to take the cough medicine we got at the hospital?

279
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,207
Fine.

280
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,507
If you're taking your medicine,

281
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:41,007
there was a vending machine in the lobby.

282
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,807
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,007
If you're going to the bathroom, I'll join you.

284
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,307
Me, too.

285
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,407
"Open the Trick Box!"

286
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,207
"Anyone able to open the trick box made by Kichiemon Samizu"

287
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:58,807
"will be awarded one million yen!"

288
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:01,307
"Each person has only five minutes to open the box."

289
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:12,207
The trick box is a huge hit.

290
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:13,907
Conan.

291
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,907
There you are.

292
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:18,207
You took forever in the bathroom, Dr. Agasa.

293
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,207
My stomach hasn't been feeling well.

294
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,307
Maybe I caught Mouri's cold.

295
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:30,807
Anyway, I thought Mouri left the bathroom shortly before I did.

296
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:34,107
He's taking another stab at opening the trick box.

297
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,607
He should just give up.

298
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:49,507
What? This cage moves?

299
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:51,807
Of course.

300
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,407
It uses sensors to accurately capture any moving object.

301
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,807
Otherwise, it'd cause major injury.

302
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:00,307
What's all this noise?

303
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:03,407
Detective Mouri was just joking around.

304
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:07,007
No. I was just checking to make sure

305
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,607
the anti-theft measures were working.

306
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,107
Oh, my! It's wet!

307
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:18,107
If any water got inside...

308
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,207
Well, because it's a wooden box.

309
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,107
It can't get wet.

310
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:25,507
Right.

311
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:32,007
Huh? Where are Ran and Sonoko?

312
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:36,207
They went to the bathroom immediately after you did.

313
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,807
Then they're taking a long time.

314
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:42,207
The women's restroom was crowded.

315
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,907
So, have you found the paper?

316
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,907
Not yet.

317
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:49,507
I saw some mystery novels I hadn't read yet

318
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:51,907
and couldn't help myself.

319
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:00,407
I smell soy sauce and mirin.

320
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,707
Were you making meat and potatoes?

321
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:03,907
Yes.

322
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:07,907
He made some before coming here.

323
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:10,307
Perhaps he spilled some on his sleeve.

324
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:12,907
Oh, my. You cook?

325
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:14,907
Yes, some.

326
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:18,107
Meat and potatoes is my specialty.

327
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,207
It was my husband's favorite.

328
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:23,807
I had his mother teach me.

329
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,907
Subaru, you cook?

330
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:29,707
How surprising.

331
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:34,107
Speaking of cooking, my husband bought

332
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:37,307
countless cookbooks for me since I loved to cook so much.

333
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:41,607
I read them so often, they were practically falling apart.

334
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:45,707
Then we can skip cookbooks.

335
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:49,707
Huh? Sonoko, did you put on some makeup?

336
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:52,107
While we were in the bathroom.

337
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:54,507
After all, Thief Kid is coming.

338
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,407
I need to dress up for him.

339
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:00,807
Even if he does come,

340
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:04,207
the anti-theft mechanisms and trick box

341
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:07,707
will probably prevent him from taking the moonstone.

342
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:10,807
Not even that pretentious thief could manage that.

343
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,807
I wouldn't be so sure.

344
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,707
This presence...

345
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,007
It's him.

346
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,507
He's nearby.

347
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,807
Who?

348
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,507
Who is he disguised as?

349
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:57,007
"Next Episode"

350
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:58,007
What?

351
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,807
A blackout?

352
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:02,607
It's Thief Kid! Thief Kid is here!

353
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:09,707
Get those lights back on.

354
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:10,807
"I've taken the contents of the box. Thief Kid"

355
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,107
"I've taken the contents of the box."

356
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:18,107
Looks like you've figured it out, too, Detective.

357
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:24,407
Next Conan, "Thief Kid and the Trick Box (Part 2)"

358
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,150
Next Conan's Hint:

359
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,450
"An exchange diary"

360
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,950
Sorry for troubling you so early in the year.

361
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,950
You're just entertaining me.
