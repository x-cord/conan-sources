1
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.040
What?

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740
That lady, she's been sitting in that seat

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040
"Kyoko Takahata (35)" -since we got here.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.040
What a beauty!

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.640
True.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.140
It's been two hours already.

7
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.040
Hello.

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.640
Speaking.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.540
What?

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.440
What did you say?

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840
Are you all right?

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.340
Pardon me.

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.140
Is something wrong?

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.640
If it's okay with you, please tell me about it.

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
My name is Kogoro Mouri.

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.040
Oh? You're that great detective?

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.640
That's right!

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.440
Actually, I just got a call from the police.

19
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.840
Someone has died in my home.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.740
What was that?

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

22
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.340
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

23
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.240
Today's case is pretty tough.

24
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.240
What's the crime that cannot be proven?

25
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.040
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

28
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.420
"The Crime with Zero Possibility to be Proven"

29
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.020
"Takahata"

30
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.520
The deceased is Itsuro Soejima, 27 years old.

31
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.820
He is the husband of Shiori, whose sister,

32
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.920
Kyoko Takahata, is the owner of this house.

33
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.620
These are a fallen chandelier and a shotgun.

34
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.020
Looks like the gun accidentally went off.

35
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.820
Is something wrong?

36
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.220
No. It's nothing.

37
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.120
And to our surprise...

38
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.820
Sorry, I'm late.

39
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.120
What took you so long, Chiba?

40
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.120
I apologize.

41
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.820
Soejima? This can't be!

42
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.020
The victim was actually officer Chiba's friend back in college.

43
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.520
What happened here?

44
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.520
His shotgun suddenly discharged,

45
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.720
causing the chandelier to fall and crash on his head.

46
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.920
What's the estimated time of death?

47
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920
Approximately an hour ago.

48
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.820
In other words,

49
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.120
he entered the house by himself while she was out.

50
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.520
He consumed alcohol to the point of getting drunk,

51
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.120
grabbed the shotgun from the cabinet

52
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.820
and loaded the gun.

53
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.420
While he was fooling around with it, it went off.

54
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.420
No way.

55
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.320
So Itsuro really...

56
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.520
I was worried that

57
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.720
something like this would happen.

58
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.720
What do you mean?

59
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.720
I don't want to say this...

60
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.720
Itsurou would start new business after business and fail,

61
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.820
going into further debt.

62
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.020
He caused my little sister Shiori to suffer.

63
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.720
However, he continued drinking

64
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.620
and caused more trouble to those around him.

65
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.020
When my sister died of an illness half a year ago,

66
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.620
his drinking problem worsened.

67
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.720
He would even go to the fitness club

68
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.820
and shooting range I introduced him to, wasted on alcohol.

69
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.320
-Please stop it. -I said let go, let go!

70
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.520
In the end, the club expelled him,

71
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.220
and his gun license was revoked.

72
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.220
Since then, it seemed he wanted to get his hands on my gun.

73
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.120
So that's why he snuck into your house when you were out,

74
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.620
and ended up like he did.

75
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.620
No way...

76
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.520
It's true that he was a drunkard,

77
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.820
and he even consulted me about it.

78
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.020
But, he said he was going to quit drinking alcohol.

79
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.420
He wanted to quit, but he just couldn't.

80
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.120
No... no way.

81
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.220
I heard about the incident at the shooting range.

82
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.320
He swore saying that

83
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.020
he would never ever touch a gun again!

84
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.820
He was blinded by alcohol and simply forgot about it.

85
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.220
That can't be it.

86
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.320
If he saw these delicious dishes lying around here,

87
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.320
I'll bet he'd start to crave a drink.

88
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.620
It's true that these dishes all go well with alcohol.

89
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.720
Hey, brat, cut out your smart aleck remarks!

90
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.620
He apparently took the dishes

91
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.620
I had prepared beforehand out of the fridge on his own.

92
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.920
I guess I'm to be held responsible too.

93
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.320
No, that's not it.

94
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.620
Ran!

95
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.820
Conan, shouldn't bother them.

96
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.220
But, where is the key?

97
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.620
The key?

98
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.720
Since she was out, how did this manage to get in?

99
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.020
I don't see any traces of the windows or doors being forced open.

100
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.220
He carried a spare key, perhaps?

101
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.520
That must be it!

102
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.220
But I don't see any spare key, anywhere.

103
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.020
And not only that

104
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.020
I don't see this man's wallet or cell phone.

105
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.720
Hey! Stop messing around!

106
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.520
The spare key is outside the entrance.

107
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.820
I told him where it was hidden too.

108
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.320
What about where you store the bullets and your shotgun?

109
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.820
I'm pretty sure I had all the doors locked.

110
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.120
-How about it? -Well, it's old

111
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.120
and the locks don't seem to be working so well.

112
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.220
If it's like this, anyone can easily open the doors.

113
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.620
If any case, an insecure cabinet such as that doesn't meet

114
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.520
the standards of the metropolis firearm storage law!

115
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.020
Be prepared to have your license revoked

116
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.020
and any punishment that will come along with it.

117
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.620
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.620
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

119
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.520
But viewing it from a different angle,

120
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.320
that's all she would have to take on,

121
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.220
despite the fact that someone had died because of it.

122
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.920
As for this case, we'll deem it an accident

123
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.320
and let the jurisdictional precinct handle it.

124
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.320
Please wait! I still can't believe this!

125
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.520
But look...

126
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.420
Let's investigate a little further!

127
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.820
Chiba! Calm yourself down!

128
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.620
It's an accident no matter how you look at it!

129
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.620
But...

130
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.220
Knock it off already!

131
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.320
Go outside and cool down!

132
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.620
It's understandable to react like that

133
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.920
when your friend dies, but...

134
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.120
Say, what were you doing at the cafe terrace?

135
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.320
What?

136
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.920
For over two hours, were you waiting for something?

137
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.220
I wasn't waiting for anything.

138
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.620
Really?

139
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.620
Knock it off now!

140
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.320
You go cool yourself down too!

141
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.820
What's this?

142
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.420
That is from Soejima's cell phone strap.

143
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.620
Really?

144
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.020
Yeah, it's a matching strap

145
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.720
with the one the late Shiori was using.

146
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.720
But there wasn't any cell phone at the scene.

147
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.520
Say, can you tell me something?

148
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.220
Soejima's personality?

149
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.820
When it came to sports, I was only good at judo,

150
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.420
but he was good at all of them.

151
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.620
At the same time, he couldn't really handle much pressure though.

152
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.120
It seemed he began relieving his stress from work, by drinking.

153
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.320
Perhaps the trouble he caused

154
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.220
wasn't just at the shooting range and the pool?

155
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.620
Maybe we should go check out the details

156
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.720
a bit more, don't you think?

157
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.220
I see.

158
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.920
With some luck, maybe we can uncover some new facts.

159
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.620
Okay. Let's go.

160
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.120
During our investigation,

161
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.320
we uncovered more of his similar troublesome incidents.

162
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.920
Drunk driving.

163
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.820
If it weren't for the guard rail,

164
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.820
the car would have gone over the edge, he would've been dead.

165
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.620
That was a month ago.

166
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.420
And two months ago...

167
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.820
He got drunk and collapsed on the street in the cold winter weather.

168
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.520
He would've frozen to death if he had been found any later than he was.

169
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.920
Adding up these similar accidents and incidents,

170
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.720
there are a total of nine of them over a span of 6 months.

171
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.120
After Shiori's death, Soejima became very depressed.

172
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.320
It's true that, for a while his alcohol consumption increased,

173
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.520
but he would always say "I'm going to quit for real this time".

174
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.620
Then, just as he was getting better,

175
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.720
he would relapse once again.

176
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.520
This happened over and over again for half a year.

177
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.320
Maybe Mr. Mouri's right,

178
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.820
he wanted to quit, but he just couldn't.

179
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.820
Still, he was a fortunate guy.

180
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.820
He was just a brother-in-law to her, and yet,

181
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.220
all the fines and compensation for the accidents he caused,

182
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.820
as well as someone to take custody of him,

183
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.220
were all taken care of by Kyoko.

184
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.020
She was also the one who introduced him to the shooting range

185
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.720
and fitness club where he caused trouble

186
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.020
as well as the owner of the house with shotguns

187
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.520
kept in an insecure cabinet,

188
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.320
plus the owner of a house he could access using a spare key.

189
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.120
Say, do you know what "indirect intent" means?

190
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.620
Indirect Intent?

191
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.420
Indirect intent is when a person foresees

192
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.820
that an action is likely to result in a harmful outcome,

193
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.320
but disregards whether it's ensured or not,

194
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.820
and follows through with the action regardless.

195
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.620
Of course I know that.

196
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.020
But Conan, I'm surprised that you know something like that.

197
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.820
Well, I heard about it from Pop Kogoro a while ago.

198
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.220
Despite foreseeing that a drunkard like Soejima

199
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.520
might get himself killed under the influence,

200
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.820
she still allows him to drive a car,

201
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.220
inviting him to go to a shooting range and swimming pool.

202
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.420
Moreover, she left the house

203
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.520
and allowed him to come, drink, and carry a gun.

204
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.320
He may die, or he may not die...

205
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.720
the possibility wasn't 100%, but it wasn't zero, either.

206
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.820
If the culprit bet on that then...

207
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.820
Don't tell me...

208
00:12:39.584 --> 00:12:42.584
Conan, I've borrowed the keys.

209
00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:46.084
But I think we ought to tell Mr. Mouri and the inspector first.

210
00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:48.184
Never mind, just hurry it up.

211
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.084
Conan.

212
00:12:52.784 --> 00:12:54.284
This room is...

213
00:12:55.284 --> 00:12:57.984
It's dark. Where's the switch?

214
00:12:57.984 --> 00:12:59.584
Oh, wait.

215
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.284
It was the cell phone recharging indicator light.

216
00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:10.384
Recharging?

217
00:13:10.384 --> 00:13:12.384
Say, whose cell phone is this?

218
00:13:12.384 --> 00:13:15.784
That is Shiori's cell phone.

219
00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:20.084
Soejima didn't want Shiori's cell phone date to be deleted,

220
00:13:20.084 --> 00:13:22.384
so he constantly recharged it.

221
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:23.884
Hang on,

222
00:13:23.884 --> 00:13:27.884
this room should've been vacant for at least half a day.

223
00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:31.184
Don't tell me, someone entered this room a couple of minutes ago

224
00:13:31.184 --> 00:13:32.584
and used the cell phone?

225
00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:36.084
What did you say? Who would do that?

226
00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.584
Looks like someone really was here.

227
00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:42.284
It looks like whoever it was searched the room.

228
00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:44.384
Could it be a cat burglar?

229
00:13:44.384 --> 00:13:46.284
If that's the case, whoever it was

230
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:47.584
wouldn't have re-locked the door, right?

231
00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:49.184
That's true, but...

232
00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:52.384
Not long ago, I received a report from my transceiver

233
00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:54.084
saying that a cat burglar frequenting this neighborhood

234
00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:55.984
was arrested at Beika Station.

235
00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:58.584
Wait, don't tell me...

236
00:13:58.584 --> 00:14:00.684
What's this?

237
00:14:00.684 --> 00:14:03.884
There's something that looks like glitter.

238
00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:05.284
What?

239
00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:08.284
This is...

240
00:14:09.784 --> 00:14:11.784
So that's how it was.

241
00:14:14.484 --> 00:14:16.984
What's this about, Mr. Mouri?

242
00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:19.884
Are you suspecting me for something?

243
00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:23.884
No. It's not like that...

244
00:14:23.884 --> 00:14:25.484
Hey, Chiba!

245
00:14:25.484 --> 00:14:29.084
What's this about? Calling us here all of a sudden?

246
00:14:29.084 --> 00:14:30.384
Explain yourself.

247
00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:33.084
That... that is to say well, that

248
00:14:33.084 --> 00:14:37.684
the culprit of this incident is you, Ms. Kyoko Takahata.

249
00:14:38.684 --> 00:14:40.584
What... what did you say?

250
00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:42.484
Further... further explanations

251
00:14:42.484 --> 00:14:45.184
will be given by Mr. Mouri, according to Conan.

252
00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:48.684
Huh? Something like that. I never...

253
00:14:52.984 --> 00:14:55.684
All right, let me explain.

254
00:14:55.684 --> 00:14:57.384
Disregard what I said earlier.

255
00:14:57.384 --> 00:15:02.684
I do suspect you. I think it was you who killed Soejima.

256
00:15:02.684 --> 00:15:04.984
I killed Itsuro?

257
00:15:04.984 --> 00:15:08.784
This had been planned for over half a year.

258
00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:10.684
No, as long as the plan succeeds,

259
00:15:10.684 --> 00:15:13.384
it doesn't matter how long it would take.

260
00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:15.984
It was a long-range murder plan.

261
00:15:15.984 --> 00:15:18.984
A perfect murder based on indirect intent!

262
00:15:20.484 --> 00:15:22.884
Knowing that Mr. Soejima was an alcoholic.

263
00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:24.784
You created numerous situations

264
00:15:24.784 --> 00:15:27.484
where he could get himself accidentally killed.

265
00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:29.684
Then, all you had to do is wait.

266
00:15:29.684 --> 00:15:33.584
Right, while sitting in a cafe terrace, drinking.

267
00:15:33.584 --> 00:15:37.284
That's interesting. Sounds like the plot of a movie or a novel.

268
00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:38.884
But do you have evidence?

269
00:15:38.884 --> 00:15:40.984
Evidence, you ask?

270
00:15:40.984 --> 00:15:42.984
It's about time for the first piece of evidence,

271
00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:46.384
rather, a witness to arrive.

272
00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:47.784
A witness?

273
00:15:47.784 --> 00:15:50.484
Chiba, I forced Beika Station to cooperate

274
00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:52.384
and brought him here!

275
00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.484
Thank you.

276
00:15:54.484 --> 00:15:55.884
I heard nothing about this!

277
00:15:55.884 --> 00:15:57.384
Ah, sorry.

278
00:15:57.384 --> 00:16:01.684
Mr. Mouri told me to assist Chiba with this.

279
00:16:01.684 --> 00:16:04.384
"Naoya Nishitani (37)" -This man is Naoya Nishitani.

280
00:16:04.384 --> 00:16:06.484
He is a recurring cat burglar

281
00:16:06.484 --> 00:16:08.084
who was arrested by the Beika police yesterday.

282
00:16:08.084 --> 00:16:09.584
A cat burglar?

283
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:13.584
Yes, he broke into this house yesterday,

284
00:16:13.584 --> 00:16:16.384
and watched the incident take place.

285
00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:17.884
What was that?

286
00:16:17.884 --> 00:16:21.184
Now, tell us again about the testimony you gave.

287
00:16:21.184 --> 00:16:25.084
Like I said, when I was rummaging around on the second floor,

288
00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:29.284
when that guy suddenly came in.

289
00:16:30.384 --> 00:16:32.484
It's Itsuro.

290
00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:34.284
Sis?

291
00:16:35.284 --> 00:16:39.384
What's she up to, calling me all the way out here, and yet...

292
00:16:43.184 --> 00:16:46.184
No, I can't. I can't drink...

293
00:16:49.984 --> 00:16:52.784
This can't be.

294
00:17:00.284 --> 00:17:04.084
Soon he drunk himself into a stupor

295
00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:06.684
and took the gun out of the cabinet.

296
00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:08.484
Just as I thought it was bad.

297
00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:24.484
Every bit of it was being set up.

298
00:17:24.484 --> 00:17:27.784
Having her license revoked because of improper storage,

299
00:17:27.784 --> 00:17:29.884
is of no concern at this point.

300
00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:31.684
This is nothing more than genuine homicide.

301
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:36.084
Please hold it! It's just his side of the story, isn't it?

302
00:17:36.084 --> 00:17:38.584
Who do you trust, me or that burglar?

303
00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:41.884
Aren't you concerned about the whereabouts

304
00:17:41.884 --> 00:17:44.484
of Mr. Soejima's cell phone?

305
00:17:44.484 --> 00:17:48.284
Back then, you were trying to find something.

306
00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:51.584
That something was Mr. Soejima's cell phone.

307
00:17:51.584 --> 00:17:54.084
You wanted to delete...

308
00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:57.284
What's she up to? Calling me all the way here. And yet...

309
00:17:57.284 --> 00:18:01.084
What you used to call Mr. Soejima here,

310
00:18:01.084 --> 00:18:04.084
the data of your text message!

311
00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:08.284
Last night, you went into Mr. Soejima's room

312
00:18:08.284 --> 00:18:11.084
and tried to find the cell phone, right?

313
00:18:11.084 --> 00:18:13.084
What're you saying?

314
00:18:13.084 --> 00:18:17.084
That's some impressive nail art.

315
00:18:17.084 --> 00:18:21.684
But, is every piece of them there? The rhinestones.

316
00:18:23.084 --> 00:18:24.584
Chiba.

317
00:18:24.584 --> 00:18:26.084
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:26.084 --> 00:18:29.184
This was found on the floor near Shiori's cell phone.

319
00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:33.384
It was the same thing as your nail decoration, isn't it?

320
00:18:35.684 --> 00:18:37.884
And the cell phone?

321
00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:40.584
Well, about that...

322
00:18:40.584 --> 00:18:42.284
After pulling out the money from the wallet,

323
00:18:42.284 --> 00:18:45.184
he threw the whole pouch into the river.

324
00:18:45.184 --> 00:18:48.284
The data was damaged, impossible to recover.

325
00:18:48.284 --> 00:18:51.384
No... no way.

326
00:18:51.384 --> 00:18:54.484
What a shame, you couldn't get your evidence.

327
00:18:54.484 --> 00:18:58.684
But regardless, there wasn't such a message in the first place.

328
00:18:58.684 --> 00:19:03.784
What I was trying to find was not the message you sent.

329
00:19:05.784 --> 00:19:09.084
But, rather, Shiori's cell phone, which you touched.

330
00:19:09.084 --> 00:19:10.684
Even after her death,

331
00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:14.084
Mr. Soejima kept recharging the phone

332
00:19:14.084 --> 00:19:15.784
and cherished it.

333
00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:21.084
To him, Shiori still seemed to be alive.

334
00:19:21.084 --> 00:19:23.784
Stop... stop talking nonsense!

335
00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:26.784
That man caused Shiori indescribable pain!

336
00:19:26.784 --> 00:19:29.584
He deserved to die for all I care!

337
00:19:29.584 --> 00:19:33.084
Now, we're finally getting to hear how you really felt.

338
00:19:33.084 --> 00:19:36.984
So what? Are you arresting me?

339
00:19:36.984 --> 00:19:39.284
I'm a private detective.

340
00:19:39.284 --> 00:19:42.884
I can neither arrest nor sentence you.

341
00:19:42.884 --> 00:19:47.084
A private detective's job is merely to find the truth.

342
00:19:48.084 --> 00:19:52.584
This time I found how your younger sister felt.

343
00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:56.384
Shiori's feelings?

344
00:19:58.084 --> 00:20:01.884
You got mail. It's okay, ust go ahead and pick it up.

345
00:20:03.184 --> 00:20:04.284
Excuse me.

346
00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.084
No... no way.

347
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:14.084
"Message Log: To Itsurou"

348
00:20:14.084 --> 00:20:17.584
It's probably a message from heaven.

349
00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:20.484
Why don't you read on?

350
00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:24.284
I'm sorry, Itsuro...

351
00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:26.684
I know we've got to work on this together.

352
00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.184
We've got to hold on, and yet, I allowed illness to defeat me.

353
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:31.784
When I get well, promise me that you'll stand on your own feet

354
00:20:31.784 --> 00:20:34.084
and apologize to my older sister.

355
00:20:34.084 --> 00:20:37.284
Don't worry, I know she'll understand.

356
00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:38.984
Because she's really kind

357
00:20:38.984 --> 00:20:42.484
and the only sister I have.

358
00:20:42.484 --> 00:20:44.484
Shiori...

359
00:20:46.484 --> 00:20:47.984
Could this be?

360
00:20:47.984 --> 00:20:52.784
Before she died, Shiori sent this message to Mr. Soejima.

361
00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:56.884
All I did was send you the saved message stored inside

362
00:20:56.884 --> 00:20:58.484
Shiori's cell phone.

363
00:20:58.484 --> 00:21:00.784
-Conan. -Here!

364
00:21:00.784 --> 00:21:03.584
I'm sorry if I surprised you.

365
00:21:03.584 --> 00:21:05.584
Since this was Shiori's cell phone,

366
00:21:05.584 --> 00:21:09.184
you didn't check it detail, did you? Yesterday.

367
00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:15.784
However, in the end, Shiori died of an illness.

368
00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:19.484
Without knowing Shiori's true feelings,

369
00:21:19.484 --> 00:21:24.184
you began your plan to murder Mr. Soejima.

370
00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:25.484
It's a lie!

371
00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:29.684
Shiori couldn't have... I'm sure she hated that guy.

372
00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:33.584
Mr. Soejima truly wanted to stand on his own feet.

373
00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:36.084
If you hadn't let anger control you,

374
00:21:36.084 --> 00:21:41.284
you could've seen it as well. His feelings and Shiori's wish!

375
00:21:41.284 --> 00:21:44.084
It's up to you from here on now.

376
00:21:44.084 --> 00:21:46.484
After you've learned of Shiori's feelings,

377
00:21:46.484 --> 00:21:48.984
will you still turn a blind eye to what you did,

378
00:21:48.984 --> 00:21:53.784
and lie to her constantly for the remainder of your life

379
00:21:53.784 --> 00:21:55.484
or...

380
00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:58.384
Shiori.

381
00:22:02.884 --> 00:22:06.384
Kyoko Takahata confessed everything.

382
00:22:06.384 --> 00:22:09.984
However, about how the law

383
00:22:09.984 --> 00:22:12.784
will sentence her crime of "Indirect Intent",

384
00:22:12.784 --> 00:22:15.084
will still be a long way from now.

385
00:23:36.184 --> 00:23:39.684
"Detective Mouri Agency" -Wait, what are you doing, Dad?

386
00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:43.784
I've come to realize that soaking myself in alcohol is unhealthy.

387
00:23:43.784 --> 00:23:45.784
So, by putting beer in front of me,

388
00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:48.184
I'm training myself to resist the temptation.

389
00:23:49.284 --> 00:23:50.384
I can't do it!

390
00:24:00.284 --> 00:24:03.484
Resisting too much will only cause stress!

391
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:06.484
You never learn, do you, Pops?

392
00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:12.684
The big eater, haunted warehouse.

393
00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:13.984
Don't you

394
00:24:13.984 --> 00:24:16.884
want to shock Conan out of his wits for a change?

395
00:24:16.884 --> 00:24:18.884
Yes, we'd like to

396
00:24:18.884 --> 00:24:22.984
at least once see him look wretched at being beaten by us.

397
00:24:24.484 --> 00:24:26.584
No... no way.

398
00:24:26.584 --> 00:24:29.084
I know for a fact

399
00:24:29.084 --> 00:24:31.984
that it was Treasure-laden!

400
00:24:31.984 --> 00:24:33.284
Next Conan,

401
00:24:33.284 --> 00:24:36.725
"A Treasure Battle at the Haunted Warehouse (Part 1)"
