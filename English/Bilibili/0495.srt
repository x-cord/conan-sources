1
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.450
And? How was it?

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.550
Huh?

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.450
You know, the connection between that boy Eisuke and Rena Mizunashi.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.050
Judging from their blood type,

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.350
it seems that Eisuke Hondo's older sister and Rena Mizunashi

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650
are two different people.

7
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.450
According to the parent child booklet, Eisuke is blood type O!

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.450
In other words, his older sister who gave him blood

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.350
has to be blood type O.

10
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.450
And Rena Mizunashi

11
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.350
who's in the hospital now is blood type AB!

12
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.350
So, Rena Mizunashi and that boy were not siblings after all?

13
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.650
No.

14
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.250
Most probably not.

15
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.450
You're hiding something from me again, aren't you?

16
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.050
Cut out that scary look of yours.

17
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.750
I'll tell you about it as soon as I find out what's going on.

18
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.350
I'm sorry, I happened to be born with this scary face.

19
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.550
See you.

20
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.150
Oh. Huh?

21
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.650
"Mouri Detective Agency"

22
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.150
I'm home!

23
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.850
Well, Yoko's song is fantastic any day.

24
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.450
It's beautiful like the twittering of birds.

25
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.950
Darn, those crows, on the third floor railing again.

26
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.750
Hey, shut up, you guys!

27
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.250
Get out of here, you darn crows!

28
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.450
I mean, "gee little crows, what makes you cry?"

29
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.250
Sizzling hot suspense.

30
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.150
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

31
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.050
From Rena Mizunashi to the Black Organization!

32
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.250
Join hands with the FBI and with great cooperation,

33
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.450
corner those guys.

34
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.950
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.550
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.950
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

37
00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:50.298
"Red and Black Crash: Coma"

38
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.398
Huh? No. It's stopped at Eisuke again?

39
00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:57.898
Yeah! I can't get through no matter how many times I try calling.

40
00:03:57.898 --> 00:03:59.798
I'm home!

41
00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:00.898
Hi, Conan.

42
00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:02.498
Hey, Ran! Are you listening?

43
00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:04.798
Is something wrong with Eisuke?

44
00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:07.398
Yep, we can't get hold of him

45
00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:10.298
and the message network is stalled again.

46
00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:12.798
We want to let him know that the school event

47
00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:15.498
that was scheduled to be held after the holidays, is cancelled.

48
00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:19.498
Again? Since when can't you get a hold of Eisuke?

49
00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:22.898
Right after winter vacation started. I think.

50
00:04:22.898 --> 00:04:26.698
Sonoko said that the message network stopped back then at Eisuke too.

51
00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:32.098
Oh, didn't Eisuke mention anything before winter vacation started?

52
00:04:32.098 --> 00:04:34.498
Oh, I think he did.

53
00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:35.998
About a clue.

54
00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:39.398
He mentioned something about finding a clue.

55
00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:41.098
At Haido Central Hospital!

56
00:04:41.098 --> 00:04:42.898
What?

57
00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:45.798
Haido Central Hospital?

58
00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:48.898
Rena Mizunashi is there.

59
00:04:48.898 --> 00:04:53.598
The woman named Kir who's one of the guys in black is there.

60
00:04:53.598 --> 00:04:55.698
But, how could he have found out?

61
00:04:55.698 --> 00:04:57.698
The FBI agents should be there tightly hiding her

62
00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:00.998
and guarding the place so that her whereabouts wouldn't be disclosed.

63
00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:02.398
It's not all that easy to find her.

64
00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:04.798
Conan?

65
00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:06.498
Conan!

66
00:05:06.498 --> 00:05:08.598
Listen to me.

67
00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:11.998
He found a clue, but it wasn't about his older sister.

68
00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:12.998
Huh?

69
00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:15.098
Then, what was it about?

70
00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:16.698
His father!

71
00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:18.098
He said he found a colleague of his father

72
00:05:18.098 --> 00:05:22.298
who used to work at the same company as his father!

73
00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:24.798
Eisuke looked really happy!

74
00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:25.798
He said that he thinks that

75
00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:27.798
his father whose whereabouts became unknown long ago,

76
00:05:27.798 --> 00:05:31.498
was looking for his colleague and older sister.

77
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.398
His father's colleague?

78
00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:35.698
You mean one of the members of the Company?

79
00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:39.098
Don't tell me that people, other than the guys in black

80
00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:41.398
are also looking for Rena Mizunashi.

81
00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:43.598
But, it was after that,

82
00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:46.398
that we couldn't get a hold of Eisuke.

83
00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:49.798
It could be that he's been looking for his older sister together

84
00:05:49.798 --> 00:05:53.398
with that person from the company since winter vacation too.

85
00:05:55.698 --> 00:05:59.498
I'm sorry that I had to ask you to come out all this way, Jodie.

86
00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:00.798
No problem!

87
00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:03.498
Calling from the hospital is too dangerous

88
00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:05.798
and besides I wanted to talk to you too.

89
00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:09.698
And, what is this troublesome thing that occurred?

90
00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:11.498
It's Eisuke Hondo!

91
00:06:11.498 --> 00:06:14.198
He went to Haido Central Hospital!

92
00:06:14.198 --> 00:06:16.798
Oh, you mean the boy that's searching for his older sister

93
00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:18.898
who looks just like Rena Mizunashi?

94
00:06:18.898 --> 00:06:22.098
It's true that he came to the hospital at the end of the year, but...

95
00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:23.998
-Really? -Yes.

96
00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:25.398
He seemed to be asking around at the nurses

97
00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:27.598
with the picture of his older sister in hand, but...

98
00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:31.698
He probably got no information and went home

99
00:06:31.698 --> 00:06:34.698
because they knew nothing about Rena Mizunashi.

100
00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:37.698
No, it's not about his older sister,

101
00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:38.698
but, rather, he's saying that

102
00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.798
he saw his father's colleague at the hospital!

103
00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:42.598
His father's?

104
00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:44.698
You mean, don't tell me it's has to do with the Company?

105
00:06:44.698 --> 00:06:49.598
Yeah, there's a possibility that they're looking for Rena Mizunashi too,

106
00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.898
although I don't really know what their purpose is yet.

107
00:06:51.898 --> 00:06:55.198
It sure is troublesome if what you're saying is true.

108
00:06:55.198 --> 00:07:00.098
If it's the Company, then they may know the faces of us FBI agents.

109
00:07:00.098 --> 00:07:02.198
After all, anything's okay with them when they want to get their way,

110
00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:04.298
so it's most likely that they'll get rough

111
00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:05.898
even inside a hospital.

112
00:07:05.898 --> 00:07:08.998
It's only natural that the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi

113
00:07:08.998 --> 00:07:11.298
will be known to them too!

114
00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:14.498
I hope all they did was stop over at Haido Central Hospital.

115
00:07:14.498 --> 00:07:17.098
If they're already hiding some place in the hospital,

116
00:07:17.098 --> 00:07:19.298
we've got to think of something fast.

117
00:07:19.298 --> 00:07:22.798
It's been bothering me for some time now

118
00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:25.298
but what on earth is the company?

119
00:07:25.298 --> 00:07:26.498
From your conversation,

120
00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:29.098
it doesn't seem like the usual kind of company.

121
00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:33.098
FBI is called the bureau office, that is, likewise.

122
00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:35.598
I think that the Company is probably a vernacular name.

123
00:07:35.598 --> 00:07:38.298
It's the organization working under the direct order of the President,

124
00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:41.598
that gathers information to cope with and execute national affairs

125
00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:43.998
having to do with the United States, including foreign affairs.

126
00:07:43.998 --> 00:07:47.098
In other words, you mean...

127
00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:48.598
The CIA.

128
00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.598
CIA?

129
00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:55.398
In other words, Eisuke's father was a spy for the U.S,

130
00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:56.698
isn't that it?

131
00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:59.798
Not really. It's only a possibility.

132
00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:03.298
No, I'm sure he was.

133
00:08:03.298 --> 00:08:04.398
You'd better be grateful

134
00:08:04.398 --> 00:08:07.798
because I searched high and low and grabbed this info.

135
00:08:07.798 --> 00:08:09.098
Which means...

136
00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:11.898
His real name is Ethern Hondo.

137
00:08:11.898 --> 00:08:13.898
He's a 2nd generation Japanese American,

138
00:08:13.898 --> 00:08:17.398
who entered the CIA 30 years ago as an agent.

139
00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:20.198
He immigrated to Japan three years after becoming an agent,

140
00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.198
got married and stayed in Japan.

141
00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:25.898
I don't know what he was looking into

142
00:08:25.898 --> 00:08:27.498
but, it's most likely...

143
00:08:27.498 --> 00:08:29.898
Information on the Men in Black.

144
00:08:29.898 --> 00:08:32.498
Yes. If we were to believe the story

145
00:08:32.498 --> 00:08:35.798
that the CIA is after Rena Mizunashi,

146
00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:37.298
I'm sure there's no doubt.

147
00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:39.098
But isn't it strange?

148
00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:40.398
I would think that if Eisuke

149
00:08:40.398 --> 00:08:42.198
were looking for Rena Mizunashi who is one of them,

150
00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:45.598
that underwent surgery to look just like Eisuke's older sister,

151
00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:48.298
the CIA would try to stop him.

152
00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:52.098
True, the organization is probably looking for her whereabouts too,

153
00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.798
so if it should become conspicuous, danger is inevitable,

154
00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:56.698
and there's a possibility that it would also hinder CIA activities.

155
00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:59.598
Above all, if Eisuke is the real son of an agent,

156
00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:01.398
I'm sure they would stop him.

157
00:09:01.398 --> 00:09:06.298
No, Eisuke Hondo did stop looking for Rena Mizunashi!

158
00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:07.998
This winter vacation

159
00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:11.398
after he said he found a colleague of his father

160
00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:12.698
at Haido Central Hospital,

161
00:09:12.698 --> 00:09:14.798
no one's been able to contact him.

162
00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:17.198
Which means that the boy was abducted by the CIA...

163
00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:20.198
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have him in their custody,

164
00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:23.298
thanks to his worried father's request.

165
00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:26.198
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

166
00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:29.898
Because that boy's father Ethern Hondo

167
00:09:29.898 --> 00:09:32.498
passed away four years ago.

168
00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:39.698
The place was an unused warehouse in Yokohama.

169
00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:43.698
The eye-witness was a homeless who was using the place as his lodgings.

170
00:09:45.698 --> 00:09:49.698
He awoke with the sound of gun fire and looked below.

171
00:09:49.698 --> 00:09:52.898
He saw a woman crouched over a man who had collapsed on the ground,

172
00:09:52.898 --> 00:09:55.598
and then saw two other men come along.

173
00:09:55.598 --> 00:09:57.498
They were both dressed in black.

174
00:09:57.498 --> 00:09:59.698
One was tall with long hair

175
00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:02.998
and the other was a stout man wearing sunglasses.

176
00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:05.998
Gin and Vodka!

177
00:10:05.998 --> 00:10:07.498
The woman who was crouched over

178
00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:11.398
explained as she gasped to the two men dressed in black.

179
00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:15.098
She grabbed the man's wrist and took his gun away.

180
00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:21.898
Then shot him.

181
00:10:21.898 --> 00:10:24.698
She then told them, "I didn't say a word."

182
00:10:24.698 --> 00:10:28.698
"Proof that I didn't, is in the MD that the dead man is holding."

183
00:10:29.898 --> 00:10:32.698
After a while, another man appeared

184
00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.998
ran over to him and shouted.

185
00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:39.498
Hondo!

186
00:10:39.498 --> 00:10:43.198
Then the man who ran over to him was also a CIA agent?

187
00:10:43.198 --> 00:10:45.298
But, just because the man shouted his last name,

188
00:10:45.298 --> 00:10:47.398
it's not proof that the man was Ethern Hondo, is it?

189
00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:50.798
The picture of Eisuke's father that you sent me.

190
00:10:50.798 --> 00:10:52.298
I showed it to him and confirmed,

191
00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:54.798
the man said he was sure it was him.

192
00:10:54.798 --> 00:10:55.898
The man?

193
00:10:55.898 --> 00:10:57.298
Mr. Akai.

194
00:10:57.298 --> 00:10:59.698
In fact, he's the one

195
00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:01.998
who found out that Ethern Hondo was a CIA agent.

196
00:11:01.998 --> 00:11:04.698
I don't know how he does it,

197
00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:08.298
but the evidence he brings together is never wrong.

198
00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:10.798
I wonder if the organization would leave

199
00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:12.598
two eye-witnesses just like that, without doing anything?

200
00:11:12.598 --> 00:11:16.898
Fortunately, it seems they weren't aware that the homeless was watching.

201
00:11:16.898 --> 00:11:21.098
But, the man who ran over, was shot by the guys who were hiding

202
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:23.098
and the warehouse was burned down to nothing in one night.

203
00:11:23.098 --> 00:11:25.598
I'm sure that they thought no one could make it out alive from there,

204
00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:28.698
like back when it happened to me.

205
00:11:28.698 --> 00:11:30.698
I was more surprised of the "woman"

206
00:11:30.698 --> 00:11:32.998
who was said to be at the scene!

207
00:11:34.098 --> 00:11:38.898
That homeless was shaking but he finally answered me,

208
00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:41.098
saying that the woman who was crouched over

209
00:11:41.098 --> 00:11:45.398
looked just like Rena Mizunashi.

210
00:11:45.398 --> 00:11:46.698
Which means...

211
00:11:46.698 --> 00:11:48.698
Rena Mizunashi is...

212
00:11:48.698 --> 00:11:52.198
Right, she couldn't be Eisuke's older sister.

213
00:11:52.198 --> 00:11:53.198
Because then it would be that

214
00:11:53.198 --> 00:11:57.798
the man's real daughter shot him to death.

215
00:11:57.798 --> 00:11:59.298
It could be that

216
00:11:59.298 --> 00:12:02.898
the woman approached Ethern Hondo pretending to be his daughter,

217
00:12:02.898 --> 00:12:06.698
in order to figure out how much information the CIA had on them,

218
00:12:06.698 --> 00:12:08.098
but he saw through her and caught her.

219
00:12:08.098 --> 00:12:12.098
So, she killed him instead before he had a chance to interrogate her?

220
00:12:15.998 --> 00:12:17.498
I guess I'm stuck now.

221
00:12:17.498 --> 00:12:19.098
I came here

222
00:12:19.098 --> 00:12:21.398
wanting to ask the boy Eisuke more about his father,

223
00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:23.498
and I was hoping that you could ask him to come.

224
00:12:23.498 --> 00:12:25.698
I had no idea that you wouldn't able to contact him.

225
00:12:25.698 --> 00:12:28.098
At any rate, let's hurry to Haido Central Hospital!

226
00:12:28.098 --> 00:12:29.198
Huh? You're going too?

227
00:12:29.198 --> 00:12:30.598
Yep.

228
00:12:30.598 --> 00:12:34.098
If the people of the CIA may be hiding there,

229
00:12:34.098 --> 00:12:35.498
I think that I would be of more use to you,

230
00:12:35.498 --> 00:12:38.998
because they don't know what I look like, right?

231
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:53.251
Yes, right!

232
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:55.751
We'll be there in ten minutes. Bye.

233
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:58.851
I have the nurse that Eisuke showed the picture to waiting here,

234
00:12:58.851 --> 00:13:00.751
just like you told me to, boss.

235
00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:02.251
Thank you.

236
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:05.251
Hey, I thought I was your boss?

237
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.551
Oh, did you say something, driver?

238
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:10.651
Doesn't it bother you, though?

239
00:13:10.651 --> 00:13:13.951
Why did that boy Eisuke disappear?

240
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:18.351
Yes, so first we get in contact with the nurse who talked to him,

241
00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:19.951
and find a clue.

242
00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:23.851
But, well, I think that the CIA has him in custody.

243
00:13:23.851 --> 00:13:25.751
His father may have passed away,

244
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.351
but I'm pretty sure that there's someone among them

245
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:29.451
who knows what his son looks like.

246
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:31.651
No, but all Eisuke Hondo said was that

247
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:34.651
he saw one of his father's colleagues at the hospital.

248
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:38.351
Huh? Wait a sec.

249
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:41.251
When we were talking about the time Eisuke Hondo's father

250
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:45.551
took him to the Okonomiyaki shop when he was small.

251
00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.051
Oh, isn't this the one?

252
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:49.351
Right, it's this picture!

253
00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:55.251
Right, it was the shop his father brought the members of the CIA to.

254
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.751
But...

255
00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:58.351
Come to think of it, whenever he brought his son with him,

256
00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:01.551
there were always only the two of them.

257
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:06.551
Which means, he couldn't have known any of the faces of the men.

258
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:10.551
If his father never let him meet any of the members,

259
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:14.051
why'd he say, he saw one of the members at the hospital?

260
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:15.751
No, wrong!

261
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:20.251
Come to think of it, he did say he found a clue.

262
00:14:20.251 --> 00:14:22.551
According to Ran, he said he found a clue,

263
00:14:22.551 --> 00:14:24.951
not saw somebody.

264
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.951
It may not have been that he saw someone.

265
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.251
If so, I wonder what he meant by

266
00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:31.951
"A clue to a colleague of his father at the Company" means?

267
00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:38.651
Hold it, if what his father said at the Okonomiyaki shop

268
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:42.751
means, the time to dive into the Black Organization has come.

269
00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:45.451
Is something the matter?

270
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:51.351
Yep, that's what Eisuke said.

271
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:52.951
That he found one of his father's colleagues

272
00:14:52.951 --> 00:14:54.451
that worked for the Company.

273
00:14:54.451 --> 00:14:56.951
You mean, he "saw" that person?

274
00:14:56.951 --> 00:14:57.951
Nope.

275
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:59.651
He said that a person at Haido Central Hospital

276
00:14:59.651 --> 00:15:01.351
was keying in the same number as the mail address

277
00:15:01.351 --> 00:15:02.651
that his father used to key in

278
00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:05.351
when he sent e-mails to his colleague at the Company.

279
00:15:05.351 --> 00:15:07.151
Person at the Company?

280
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:10.451
If he didn't see the person yet, how did he know the e-mail address?

281
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.751
-The sound. -Sound?

282
00:15:12.751 --> 00:15:15.651
It seems that his father used to call him at times

283
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:18.751
when he was on business abroad,

284
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.451
he used to hear the address being keyed in on the phone.

285
00:15:21.451 --> 00:15:24.551
He said it sounded a lot like a melody.

286
00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:25.651
Melody?

287
00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:28.851
Oh, right, I'm sure it was the children's song.

288
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:37.451
Seven Baby Crows!

289
00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:40.951
-What was that sound just now? -When he asked his father,

290
00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:43.851
he was told that his father was sending out an e-mail

291
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:45.851
to a colleague at the Company!

292
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:50.651
Which means what Eisuke saw at Haido Central Hospital was...

293
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:54.151
The guys that may be hiding in the hospital

294
00:15:54.151 --> 00:15:55.651
are not CIA agents,

295
00:15:55.651 --> 00:15:57.551
but rather, the members of the Black Organization!

296
00:15:57.551 --> 00:15:59.751
"Haido Central Hospital"

297
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.851
Oh, the members of that Organization are here at this hospital.

298
00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:05.551
Yes, that's right!

299
00:16:05.551 --> 00:16:08.451
But, it's still just a possibility.

300
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:10.551
It could be that they just dropped by.

301
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:13.151
Is that tip off, something you can trust?

302
00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:15.051
It came from Conan Edogawa.

303
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:18.351
He says that one of his acquaintances saw a person

304
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:21.151
sending e-mail from the Haido Central Hospital

305
00:16:21.151 --> 00:16:24.151
to the boss of the Organization.

306
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.251
That boy again.

307
00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:28.051
You're really enthusiastic, aren't you, Jodie?

308
00:16:28.051 --> 00:16:31.851
At any rate, the nurse that was contacted by the boy

309
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:33.451
is waiting at the hospital,

310
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:38.951
so tell the investigators to stay inconspicuous until we arrive.

311
00:16:38.951 --> 00:16:41.351
If they find out that we, the FBI

312
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:43.951
are sheltering Rena Mizunashi at the hospital,

313
00:16:43.951 --> 00:16:47.951
the only string that may connect us to the Organization may be severed.

314
00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:50.351
Roger.

315
00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:03.651
The only string?

316
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:11.451
But, just lowering a string into the dark depth of the sea,

317
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:14.251
will bear no fruit.

318
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:22.051
In order to fish them out,

319
00:17:22.051 --> 00:17:28.051
we need bait that will lure them out deep into our pockets and...

320
00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:38.051
and a needle that will poke deep into their throats.

321
00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:41.451
Oh, this young man.

322
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:46.151
He came at the end of the year with the picture of a woman.

323
00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:49.951
Was that the picture of the announcer Rena Mizunashi?

324
00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:51.351
Yes,

325
00:17:51.351 --> 00:17:54.751
he asked me if that person was hospitalized here but...

326
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.251
I told him she wasn't.

327
00:17:57.251 --> 00:17:58.451
If she were, I'm sure that the rumor of her being here

328
00:17:58.451 --> 00:18:01.151
would've spread throughout the hospital immediately.

329
00:18:01.151 --> 00:18:04.651
So, he was looking for Rena Mizunashi

330
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.951
and not his older sister, after all?

331
00:18:06.951 --> 00:18:08.551
But, is it really true that

332
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:11.551
this young man's whereabouts is unknown since he came here?

333
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:15.151
Rather, it's more like we can't get a hold of him.

334
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:16.951
That's why his teacher is also looking for him

335
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:19.951
together with the people living in the neighborhood.

336
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:24.351
And, besides, Rena Mizunashi is taking a long time off, right?

337
00:18:24.351 --> 00:18:27.251
So, he suspected that maybe she was sick or something

338
00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:29.651
and hospitalized.

339
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:33.851
I mean, he's a really great fan of Rena Mizunashi, you see,

340
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:35.451
I think he's been looking around for her

341
00:18:35.451 --> 00:18:39.251
all through winter vacation without even going home,

342
00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:42.051
but did he say anything else?

343
00:18:42.051 --> 00:18:45.151
Oh. Come to think of it, back then.

344
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:48.451
Somebody asked me the same question you're asking me now!

345
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.951
The question was,

346
00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:53.051
I saw a person who looked just like Rena Mizunashi in this hospital

347
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:54.851
but is it really her?

348
00:18:54.851 --> 00:18:56.851
I was surprised!

349
00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:00.551
What did that person look like?

350
00:19:00.551 --> 00:19:04.551
Well... I couldn't see very well.

351
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:06.151
You couldn't see?

352
00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:17.051
I dropped my contacts when someone bumped into me then.

353
00:19:17.051 --> 00:19:19.751
And, that's when he called out to me.

354
00:19:19.751 --> 00:19:21.051
The voice? What sort of voice was it?

355
00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:25.351
I wonder. I know it was a man's voice,

356
00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:27.151
but I can't say what kind of voice it was.

357
00:19:27.151 --> 00:19:29.651
Oh, but I think

358
00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:32.951
he was a patient who was hospitalized here at the end of the year.

359
00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:34.751
Although blurred, I saw the person wearing the sandals

360
00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:37.351
that the shop at the hospital newly purchased,

361
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:40.251
and put on sale just around that time.

362
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:42.551
What?

363
00:19:42.551 --> 00:19:44.651
Since when were those sandals sold in the store?

364
00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:48.751
If I remember correctly, I think it was around December 18th.

365
00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:52.051
So, I guess the guys of the organization

366
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:53.751
are hiding somewhere in this hospital.

367
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:55.751
There's no doubt about it.

368
00:19:57.251 --> 00:19:59.251
"Haido Central Hospital"

369
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:02.151
I think we should move Rena Mizunashi

370
00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:04.451
to another place right now!

371
00:20:04.451 --> 00:20:06.651
Now that we know that the guys of the Organization

372
00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:07.851
are hiding here somewhere,

373
00:20:07.851 --> 00:20:10.951
it's too risky to keep sheltering her here!

374
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:13.351
But, if we take rash measures,

375
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:17.151
it'll be like telling the guys of the Organization that she's here.

376
00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:20.951
If there's another hospital that we can move her to,

377
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:22.951
we could do something about it now, but...

378
00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:25.351
I think it's best to keep her here, as is.

379
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:27.451
As is?

380
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:29.451
Judging from the fact that they're disguising themselves

381
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:31.051
as patients here and asking the nurses for hints

382
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:34.251
on the whereabouts of Rena Mizunashi,

383
00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:37.451
it shows that they're still in the process of looking for her.

384
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:40.451
It's not that they've come here knowing that she's here.

385
00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:42.351
Besides, this could be our chance.

386
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:43.451
Our chance?

387
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:47.251
Yeah, to add another string to the only one we had.

388
00:20:47.251 --> 00:20:49.151
It's true that capturing the man

389
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:52.751
before they find out about anything would be ideal but...

390
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.551
There seems to be over 20 men

391
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:58.451
who were hospitalized here at the end of the year.

392
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:01.351
It would be way too difficult to check on all those people

393
00:21:01.351 --> 00:21:04.051
hiding our identities as FBI agents.

394
00:21:04.051 --> 00:21:06.251
Moreover, it would be too time consuming.

395
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:08.251
If that nurse

396
00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:12.551
could only recall what day the man asked her the question.

397
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:15.351
I think it was between December 18th to the 21st,

398
00:21:15.351 --> 00:21:17.251
during one of these four days!

399
00:21:17.251 --> 00:21:19.151
Pardon?

400
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:22.851
Teitan High School's winter vacation starts from December 23rd.

401
00:21:22.851 --> 00:21:25.351
It seems that Eisuke talked about coming here

402
00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:28.351
before winter vacation started so,

403
00:21:28.351 --> 00:21:30.851
he must've come here before the 21st.

404
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:34.651
If the store started selling the sandals on December the 18th,

405
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:36.951
the only people you need to check are those

406
00:21:36.951 --> 00:21:40.351
who were hospitalized before the 21st, right?

407
00:21:40.351 --> 00:21:42.151
Right!

408
00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:44.251
Okay, let's have the hospital

409
00:21:44.251 --> 00:21:48.051
submit a list of all the patients that fall in this category!

410
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:50.751
The only other thing that bothers me

411
00:21:50.751 --> 00:21:53.251
is the whereabouts of the boy called Eisuke.

412
00:21:53.251 --> 00:21:55.451
Well, as far as the FBI is concerned,

413
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:56.951
it's more convenient that

414
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:58.751
he stays out of the scene as is, for now.

415
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.151
Having NOC's son snooping here and there,

416
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:03.151
could call for more trouble.

417
00:22:03.151 --> 00:22:04.651
NOC?

418
00:22:04.651 --> 00:22:06.651
Non Official Cover,

419
00:22:06.651 --> 00:22:08.151
more commonly known as NOC!

420
00:22:08.151 --> 00:22:11.151
They are secret agents who disguise themselves as ordinary citizens

421
00:22:11.151 --> 00:22:13.551
in foreign countries and go about their activities!

422
00:22:13.551 --> 00:22:15.651
You seem to know a lot of things,

423
00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:17.151
and yet this is the first time you heard this terminology?

424
00:22:17.151 --> 00:22:22.551
No, I know about it, but something about that word bothers me.

425
00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:25.051
Non Official Cover,

426
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:27.551
more commonly know as NOC.

427
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:29.651
There's no reason they would leave a boy

428
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:32.151
who knows their boss' e-mail address, as is,

429
00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:34.751
without doing anything.

430
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:38.151
Well, if you're worried as to whether NOC's son is safe,

431
00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:40.051
he's probably not.

432
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:14.051
Who are the members of the Black Organization

433
00:24:14.051 --> 00:24:17.051
that are looking for Rena Mizunashi?

434
00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:20.851
I've narrowed it down to three men

435
00:24:20.851 --> 00:24:24.551
and I'm going to get in touch with them immediately!

436
00:24:24.551 --> 00:24:26.251
No matter how dangerous it may be,

437
00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:28.751
I'm going to tear off the masks that they're wearing

438
00:24:28.751 --> 00:24:31.651
and grab a clue on the Black Organization!

439
00:24:33.151 --> 00:24:35.651
Next on Detective Conan,

440
00:24:35.651 --> 00:24:40.351
"Red and Black Crash: Raid"

441
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:58.151
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:58.151 --> 00:25:00.351
Mark of a wound.

443
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:02.051
That's it, for children's time.

444
00:25:02.051 --> 00:25:04.351
Kids, on your mark and go to bed.

445
00:25:04.351 --> 00:25:05.851
Mark out the course.
