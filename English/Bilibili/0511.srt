1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.940
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.240
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.040
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.140
A rival of Shinichi appears again?

5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.840
A match to solve the mystery of paper planes is launched!

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57.226 --> 00:02:00.326
A new member of the Black Organization has started to make a move.

10
00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:01.926
He's skilled in collecting information,

11
00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:05.126
observatory skills and also insightful.

12
00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:07.526
His code name is Bourbon.

13
00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.726
He shouldn't be taken lightly.

14
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:11.326
Although the case of Kaito Sugiura's apartment

15
00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:13.826
being set fire to was solved,

16
00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:16.326
one of the residents who lost his home in the fire,

17
00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:18.926
Mr. Subaru Okiya, ends up freeloading at my,

18
00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:23.626
that is Shinichi Kudo's house.

19
00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.426
Ran and Sonoko, who didn't know about this

20
00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.926
mistakenly thought that he was a thief.

21
00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:34.626
I wonder if Subaru who was kicked by Ran is okay?

22
00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:40.626
The recent talk of the town is the paper plane prankster.

23
00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:44.226
Every night close to 100 paper planes are scattered throughout town,

24
00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:47.526
and a strange mark is drawn on those planes.

25
00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:50.926
When I saw the image of the paper plane

26
00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:53.126
that Ran had attached to the mail she sent me,

27
00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:56.526
I realized that there was an important message hidden behind it.

28
00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:58.926
The message was...

29
00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:07.926
"Deduction Match! Shinichi vs. Subaru Okiya".

30
00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:11.026
Another type of paper plane?

31
00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.626
Yes. If I remember correctly, it said in the news

32
00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.226
that close to 100 paper planes were retrieved in town

33
00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:17.826
the day before yesterday and yesterday morning.

34
00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:20.826
So, if the message that is drawn on the paper planes

35
00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:23.126
the day before yesterday and yesterday differ,

36
00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:26.126
I just thought that maybe we could narrow down

37
00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:29.726
the location of the person who sent out the SOS.

38
00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:32.826
By the way, when did you find this in your yard?

39
00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:35.526
I found it in the morning the day before yesterday.

40
00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:37.026
Before that, tell me, will you?

41
00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:40.326
Why is that paper plane a SOS signal?

42
00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:43.026
It's the design that's drawn on the plane.

43
00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:46.526
The size of the circles in front and back is practically the same.

44
00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:49.126
And the length of the dashes are is as long as the three circles.

45
00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:52.126
And the space between the circles

46
00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:54.726
is just about equal to the size of one circle.

47
00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:59.726
Yes, this is the Morse code that frequently used

48
00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:01.726
as a means of communication.

49
00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.326
You mean the Morse Code

50
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.026
that usually come out in old movies?

51
00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:08.226
Yes, that's right.

52
00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:11.226
The circles are short dots that are made by short taps.

53
00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:14.126
The dashes are long dots made by long taps.

54
00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.726
In the Morse code, three dots made by short taps equals "S"

55
00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:19.026
and three long dots equals "O".

56
00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:21.926
In other words, SOS would be

57
00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:26.926
tap tap tap, dash dash dash, tap tap tap.

58
00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:31.126
It's a signal asking for help.

59
00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.826
That's what's written in the mail.

60
00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:36.026
No! You mean Shinichi figured it out too?

61
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.726
Yes. It also says

62
00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:39.726
he wants to see images of other paper planes if there are any,

63
00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.526
and he'd like me to send them to him.

64
00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:44.226
Shinichi? Come to think of it,

65
00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:47.426
the name of the owner of this house is Shinichi too, isn't it?

66
00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:48.526
Don't you know him?

67
00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:51.026
He's a high school detective named Shin...

68
00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.426
Kinichi.

69
00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:56.226
There's this boy that likes to make a deduction in the same class.

70
00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:59.826
So he's name is Kinichi and not Shinichi?

71
00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:01.926
Yes. The Shinichi that's living here

72
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.726
is just an ordinary high school student that can't do much.

73
00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:06.526
An ordinary high school student?

74
00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:10.226
I just can't help feeling otherwise about him though.

75
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.726
What makes you say that?

76
00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:12.826
Because there is

77
00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:16.926
no trace of anything that shows that he had been living here.

78
00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:18.226
None of his clothes, no diary,

79
00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:20.526
or albums and the like are anywhere in sight.

80
00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:24.226
Well, at least nowhere that can easily be seen that is.

81
00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:26.226
You think so?

82
00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:28.726
It could be that he didn't want us to see his things

83
00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:31.926
knowing that we'd come to clean his place up and hid them all somewhere.

84
00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:34.226
Taking about cleaning up,

85
00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:37.726
even the employee that we stopped over at a while ago was told by the owner

86
00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:43.426
to clean up the paper plane that was stuck to the sign of the shop, right?

87
00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:46.926
Then let's go get it right away.

88
00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:48.226
Wait, Ran!

89
00:05:52.326 --> 00:05:54.526
Hey, just what's this Kinichi thing about?

90
00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:59.026
That's because Shinichi told me a while ago not to tell that man about him.

91
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.426
Shinichi told you that?

92
00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:01.926
It seems that he sent Conan a mail

93
00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:04.526
saying that he doesn't want the man to take an interest in him

94
00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:07.226
and start searching around the house for things.

95
00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:15.026
I guess detectives like to search around about other people

96
00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:17.026
but don't like it the other way around.

97
00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:19.126
Yes.

98
00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:20.826
Besides,

99
00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:23.426
I kind of couldn't help stopping myself

100
00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:25.526
from talking about Shinichi to him.

101
00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:30.526
A feeling that I shouldn't. A kind of anxiousness.

102
00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:33.926
Next, we'll try writing the names of flowers in Katakana!

103
00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.526
Ran is sure taking her time.

104
00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:39.726
It can't be that there was only one type of paper plane.

105
00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:45.826
Finally. Let's see.

106
00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:47.526
It seems that the paper planes of yesterday

107
00:06:47.526 --> 00:06:49.526
and the day before yesterday are different.

108
00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:51.926
I'll attach the image.

109
00:06:51.926 --> 00:06:53.226
What's this?

110
00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:55.226
There's no design on it.

111
00:06:57.026 --> 00:06:58.426
A closer look at it

112
00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:01.626
shows five dashes on the folded crease of the body of the paper plane.

113
00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:05.026
In Morse code, five long dashes means "zero".

114
00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:07.426
What on earth does the zero stand for?

115
00:07:09.826 --> 00:07:12.326
There's a design on the other side too.

116
00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:16.326
But it looks like a line had been drawn along the folded crease.

117
00:07:18.826 --> 00:07:20.626
This... this is...

118
00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:25.026
The mark of an antenna?

119
00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:26.726
Of a cell phone?

120
00:07:29.826 --> 00:07:31.726
Really, they're exactly alike!

121
00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:33.526
In other words, if you match it up

122
00:07:33.526 --> 00:07:35.526
with the five dashes that are drawn body of the paper plane,

123
00:07:35.526 --> 00:07:36.726
there is zero radio wave.

124
00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:40.226
Moreover, taking into consideration the first SOS. The message is,

125
00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.726
"I'm in a place where cell phones are out of service range,

126
00:07:42.726 --> 00:07:46.226
so please help me".

127
00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:49.726
Wow! Subaru, you're a fantastic detective.

128
00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:51.726
But, all we know now is that

129
00:07:51.726 --> 00:07:54.326
the person is in a place where cell phones are out of range.

130
00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:55.726
Out of service range,

131
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:58.026
you mean in a cave in the remote mountains or something?

132
00:07:58.026 --> 00:08:02.126
But the paper planes were retrieved only in town.

133
00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:03.226
Then, maybe in the basement!

134
00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:04.926
How would anyone be able to fly a plane from the basement

135
00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:07.026
to the yard of your house Sonoko?

136
00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:09.026
Oh, right.

137
00:08:09.026 --> 00:08:10.326
Wait.

138
00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:12.426
If paper planes were retrieved the day before yesterday and yesterday,

139
00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:13.426
I'm sure that even today...

140
00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.526
I see, the news on TV!

141
00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:19.026
The identity of the kidnapper on the run

142
00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:21.626
who jumped off the building early this morning

143
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.026
has not yet been verified.

144
00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:25.426
"Ikuo Shirota" -The whereabouts of the president of the shipbuilding

145
00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:28.626
that has been kidnapped has not been found yet.

146
00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:29.626
The police are

147
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:32.226
investigating the case as one of a grudge against Mr. Shirota,

148
00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:33.426
and are attempting to identify the kidnapper...

149
00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:35.826
Every station is airing news about this incident.

150
00:08:36.926 --> 00:08:38.326
They reported on the morning news

151
00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:43.026
that this man used his experience back when he used to be a sailor,

152
00:08:43.026 --> 00:08:45.426
to enlarge his company.

153
00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:47.226
Maybe...

154
00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:48.926
What is it, Subaru?

155
00:08:48.926 --> 00:08:50.626
Maybe this case

156
00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:53.126
is connected in some way with the incident of the paper planes.

157
00:08:54.426 --> 00:08:58.026
If he's been abducted and is being confined somewhere...

158
00:08:58.026 --> 00:08:59.926
It's very likely that he's avoiding the eyes of his kidnapper

159
00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:03.426
and flying paper planes night after night.

160
00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:06.926
Then, you're saying that President Shirota is the paper plane prankster?

161
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.626
Yes, I think it's very likely.

162
00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:11.126
If he used to be a sailor before,

163
00:09:11.126 --> 00:09:13.326
it's not surprising that he knows how to use the Morse code

164
00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:16.826
that's used in emergencies.

165
00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:20.226
He's probably not aware that the kidnapper committed suicide

166
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.526
and is still trying to get help secretly.

167
00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:24.926
I see.

168
00:09:24.926 --> 00:09:27.626
Even if the kidnapper happens to see this and pick it up,

169
00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:30.626
he would think nothing of it except as some child's play!

170
00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.226
It seems that the paper planes that were retrieved yesterday

171
00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:33.326
and the day before yesterday

172
00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:38.926
were made by ripping off pages from a magazine.

173
00:09:38.926 --> 00:09:41.226
President Shirota probably cannot move around much

174
00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:44.426
and the most he can do is get hold of that magazine.

175
00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:47.326
Oh, no.

176
00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:51.026
Now, for a follow-up report on the paper plane prankster.

177
00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:52.126
Here it is!

178
00:09:52.126 --> 00:09:55.726
I am at a park near the Beika Tower Condominium

179
00:09:55.726 --> 00:09:58.626
where the paper planes in question were found this morning.

180
00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:02.126
As to the design on the paper planes that are of interest,

181
00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:04.226
there is nothing on this side,

182
00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:06.726
but on the opposite side, there is one circle

183
00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:10.426
and four imperfect circles that are drawn symmetrically.

184
00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:11.726
Moreover, at a close look,

185
00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.626
there is a weird looking crease on it.

186
00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:16.026
The mystery gets even deeper.

187
00:10:16.026 --> 00:10:17.626
Crease?

188
00:10:17.626 --> 00:10:19.626
We can't see it very well on the TV.

189
00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:34.426
Hey now, it's class time.

190
00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:38.226
But Conan is engrossed in folding paper planes.

191
00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:39.726
Hey, Conan.

192
00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:41.526
That's something you should be doing during recess.

193
00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:43.926
I'm sorry, Teacher. But can you leave me alone?

194
00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:45.726
You know what...

195
00:10:45.726 --> 00:10:48.826
Somebody's life may be in danger!

196
00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:50.126
Is that right?

197
00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:51.526
Yeah.

198
00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.526
The one who's flying this

199
00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:55.926
is probably President Shirota who was kidnapped

200
00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.526
and he's being locked up in a place where the cell phones

201
00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:59.526
are out of service range.

202
00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.726
The fact that he can fold and fly so many paper planes

203
00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:03.926
despite being in his situation,

204
00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:04.926
just goes to show that it's most likely

205
00:11:04.926 --> 00:11:08.226
that he's being left without getting any care since he's been locked up.

206
00:11:08.226 --> 00:11:10.626
If he by chance hasn't eaten or drunk anything,

207
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.526
things may be for the worse.

208
00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:15.026
They should be able to narrow down the President's whereabouts

209
00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:17.526
with the paper planes that were retrieved this time.

210
00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:19.326
But what is this anyway?

211
00:11:19.326 --> 00:11:22.826
These four unclosed circles and strange crase?

212
00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:26.126
Wait a sec. If this is also a Morse code,

213
00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:29.726
the unclosed circles are probably a set.

214
00:11:29.726 --> 00:11:30.726
Two circles make a set.

215
00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:31.826
Four circles equal two circles,

216
00:11:31.826 --> 00:11:34.426
plus there is one circle that is originally there...

217
00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:37.526
One circle equals "E" and two makes "I".

218
00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:41.526
If read romaji style it would either be "ei" or "ie"(house).

219
00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:43.526
Just where is the house anyway?

220
00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:48.626
Subaru.

221
00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:52.626
There are many different ways to fold paper planes, aren't they?

222
00:11:52.626 --> 00:11:53.726
There are many kinds.

223
00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:57.126
Like cicadas and sparrows.

224
00:11:57.126 --> 00:12:01.926
I think there were other things that it resembled that can't even fly.

225
00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:17.426
I see.

226
00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:19.226
It's over here!

227
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:34.137
Hey, Conan, what's that?

228
00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:36.137
A paper plane?

229
00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:38.137
It looks like a squid!

230
00:12:38.137 --> 00:12:39.637
But I think if so,

231
00:12:39.637 --> 00:12:42.237
you'd have to fold the head part once more.

232
00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:45.037
No, this is just fine.

233
00:12:45.037 --> 00:12:46.537
The person who flew this

234
00:12:46.537 --> 00:12:48.037
wanted to make the people who picked it up

235
00:12:48.037 --> 00:12:50.237
make the paper plane like this.

236
00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.737
Don't tell me that you're talking about

237
00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:55.837
the paper plane prankster that's the talk of the town now?

238
00:12:55.837 --> 00:12:58.837
Yeah, you spread the squid out once like this

239
00:12:58.837 --> 00:13:02.437
then, turn the paper upside down and fold the plane.

240
00:13:03.537 --> 00:13:06.737
See, it looks just like the paper planes

241
00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:09.137
that were retrieved today, doesn't it?

242
00:13:09.137 --> 00:13:10.637
I see.

243
00:13:10.637 --> 00:13:14.337
A squid is made by a queer crease and two separated black circles.

244
00:13:14.337 --> 00:13:18.237
The person wanted to relay the real message to the people this way.

245
00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:22.337
Wait up, wasn't the paper plane thing supposed to be a prank?

246
00:13:22.337 --> 00:13:24.937
It seems that the paper planes that were retrieved

247
00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:26.637
the day before yesterday, yesterday and today

248
00:13:26.637 --> 00:13:29.637
all had different designs on them.

249
00:13:29.637 --> 00:13:33.337
So, I guess it'd be safe to say some kind of message is behind them?

250
00:13:33.337 --> 00:13:36.137
But who for what reason?

251
00:13:36.137 --> 00:13:37.537
In order to find out,

252
00:13:37.537 --> 00:13:41.037
we'll need Conan to solve the code first and then...

253
00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:42.937
He's gone?

254
00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:44.037
Conan?

255
00:13:46.837 --> 00:13:48.137
Bei?

256
00:13:48.137 --> 00:13:51.137
You mean those three circles mean "bei"?

257
00:13:51.137 --> 00:13:53.237
Yes, most likely.

258
00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:55.837
This is probably a Japanese Morse code,

259
00:13:55.837 --> 00:13:57.537
so one circle would be pronounced "hei",

260
00:13:57.537 --> 00:13:59.537
but since there are two, it indicates a voiced consonant,

261
00:13:59.537 --> 00:14:02.337
so put together, it's pronounced "bei".

262
00:14:04.037 --> 00:14:07.137
But what's the message?

263
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:09.237
Can't you tell by this shape?

264
00:14:09.237 --> 00:14:10.737
Shape?

265
00:14:10.737 --> 00:14:11.837
A squid?

266
00:14:11.837 --> 00:14:14.737
So, if you put these two together...

267
00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:15.937
Bei.

268
00:14:15.937 --> 00:14:17.937
Squid. ("Ika" is pronunciation of "squid" in Japanese)

269
00:14:17.937 --> 00:14:19.337
-Beika! -Beika!

270
00:14:19.337 --> 00:14:21.637
In other words, Beikacho.

271
00:14:21.637 --> 00:14:22.837
A play on words?

272
00:14:22.837 --> 00:14:24.337
Well, if you get to the bottom of things

273
00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:26.637
codes are similar to a play on words too.

274
00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:27.737
If they're paper planes

275
00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:30.937
the President Shirota who was kidnapped and confined flew,

276
00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:34.237
so long as the kidnapper can't make out the message,

277
00:14:34.237 --> 00:14:37.037
whether it's a play on words or whatever, it really doesn't matter, does it?

278
00:14:37.037 --> 00:14:40.437
Then, where is President Shirota?

279
00:14:40.437 --> 00:14:42.137
If I remember correctly, the first paper plane

280
00:14:42.137 --> 00:14:43.537
sent out the message SOS.

281
00:14:43.537 --> 00:14:44.537
The next message was,

282
00:14:44.537 --> 00:14:47.637
"A place where cell phones are outside of service range."

283
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.837
If we connect all three messages it would come out to,

284
00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:52.537
"Help me, I'm confined in a place in Beikacho

285
00:14:52.537 --> 00:14:54.937
where cell phones are out of service range."

286
00:14:54.937 --> 00:14:58.837
I wonder if there's a place like that in Beikacho, besides a basement.

287
00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:00.337
A tall building.

288
00:15:01.537 --> 00:15:04.037
The base station antenna for cell phones

289
00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:07.737
is faced towards the ground where the inlet density is high,

290
00:15:07.737 --> 00:15:11.237
so if you're anywhere higher than that, it's hard to connect.

291
00:15:11.237 --> 00:15:12.637
Even if connection is successful,

292
00:15:12.637 --> 00:15:13.737
because of its height,

293
00:15:13.737 --> 00:15:16.137
it'll pick up multiple radio waves from the base station

294
00:15:16.137 --> 00:15:17.837
and roaming will frequently occur,

295
00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:20.637
resulting in out of service range.

296
00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:24.237
There are two tall buildings in Beikacho,

297
00:15:24.237 --> 00:15:26.937
but it would be difficult to confine a person in a place

298
00:15:26.937 --> 00:15:29.337
where people go in and out to make the beds.

299
00:15:29.337 --> 00:15:30.837
Therefore,

300
00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:35.237
President Shirota is most likely confined in the Beika Tower Condominium.

301
00:15:35.237 --> 00:15:37.737
No, that's pretty close from here!

302
00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:39.637
Well, the out of service range was probably indicated

303
00:15:39.637 --> 00:15:41.937
just to make locating the place he is confined easier,

304
00:15:41.937 --> 00:15:43.437
because I'm pretty sure

305
00:15:43.437 --> 00:15:46.237
that the kidnapper took his cell phone away from him already.

306
00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.137
We'd better notify the police ASAP about this.

307
00:15:50.837 --> 00:15:51.937
Telephone?

308
00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.837
Ran, it's me!

309
00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:57.037
Shinichi!

310
00:15:57.037 --> 00:15:58.937
Where are you now?

311
00:15:58.937 --> 00:16:00.637
Still at your house.

312
00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:01.737
All the better.

313
00:16:01.737 --> 00:16:04.837
Go to the Beika Tower Condominium nearby!

314
00:16:04.837 --> 00:16:09.137
That's where President Shirota who was kidnapped is confined.

315
00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:11.437
That means that you solved the mystery of the paper planes?

316
00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.137
Yeah, but I'll explain later.

317
00:16:14.137 --> 00:16:15.637
The desk in my room.

318
00:16:15.637 --> 00:16:18.137
In the second drawer, you'll find binoculars!

319
00:16:18.137 --> 00:16:21.537
Take that and ride the observatory elevator of the Beika Hotel.

320
00:16:21.537 --> 00:16:23.437
Have Sonoko call the police

321
00:16:23.437 --> 00:16:24.537
and go there right away!

322
00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:29.037
I wanted to go with Ran too.

323
00:16:29.037 --> 00:16:32.937
Well, let's let the he and she take care of the site.

324
00:16:32.937 --> 00:16:34.537
He?

325
00:16:34.537 --> 00:16:39.437
Kinichi, was it? The one who likes to make deductions.

326
00:16:53.937 --> 00:16:58.137
But Shinichi, from here I can only see one side of the condo.

327
00:16:58.137 --> 00:17:01.537
Yeah, if he's on the side that you can't see, it'll be a waste,

328
00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:03.037
but it's better than not even giving it a try!

329
00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.537
-Did you find it? -Yes.

330
00:17:20.537 --> 00:17:23.737
The room to the very right on the east side of the 36th floor!

331
00:17:23.737 --> 00:17:25.037
The window is slightly opened

332
00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:27.337
and there are many paper planes on the veranda.

333
00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:29.737
Ran! Just because you found the place he's being confined,

334
00:17:29.737 --> 00:17:31.337
don't go barging in there on your own, now!

335
00:17:31.337 --> 00:17:33.037
Although the likelihood is close to nil,

336
00:17:33.037 --> 00:17:36.137
an accomplice of the kidnapper may still be there!

337
00:17:36.137 --> 00:17:40.937
Yep. I'll e-mail Sonoko who's at the police about this and...

338
00:17:44.837 --> 00:17:46.337
What's up, Ran?

339
00:17:46.337 --> 00:17:47.837
Oh, no.

340
00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:50.337
The paper plane that just came flying

341
00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:52.337
is folded with a 10,000 yen bill.

342
00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:53.537
What?

343
00:17:53.537 --> 00:17:54.937
There's nothing drawn on it,

344
00:17:54.937 --> 00:17:56.637
but I wonder if this is President Shirota's paper plane too?

345
00:17:56.637 --> 00:17:58.437
Yeah, most likely!

346
00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:00.837
Even if nothing is drawn on it, if money comes flying,

347
00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:03.237
everyone would go nuts and search where it's flying from

348
00:18:03.237 --> 00:18:04.937
and the police would surely be notified.

349
00:18:04.937 --> 00:18:06.137
That's what he's after.

350
00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:08.537
But flying something like this in broad daylight

351
00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:10.237
would be taking the risk of the kidnapper finding it out,

352
00:18:10.237 --> 00:18:12.737
means President Shirota is taking a sink or swim chance!

353
00:18:12.737 --> 00:18:16.737
In other words, it means that President Shirota is in pretty bad condition.

354
00:18:16.737 --> 00:18:18.437
The first time the paper plane was found

355
00:18:18.437 --> 00:18:20.037
was the morning the day before yesterday,

356
00:18:20.037 --> 00:18:21.037
so it's already been more than three days

357
00:18:21.037 --> 00:18:23.037
since he first started flying the paper planes.

358
00:18:23.037 --> 00:18:25.137
Moreover, the kidnapper committed suicide.

359
00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:28.637
If he's being left as is and give no food or water,

360
00:18:28.637 --> 00:18:31.937
he could be on the verge of starvation or be extremely dehydrated.

361
00:18:31.937 --> 00:18:34.737
I'll call the police and ambulance,

362
00:18:34.737 --> 00:18:35.737
so you wait there, Ran.

363
00:18:35.737 --> 00:18:38.537
What would you do, Shinichi?

364
00:18:38.537 --> 00:18:41.537
You wouldn't wait in times like this, would you, Shinichi?

365
00:18:42.737 --> 00:18:44.637
I'm going!

366
00:18:44.637 --> 00:18:45.637
Wait!

367
00:18:45.637 --> 00:18:48.137
I told you there's a possibility that the kidnapper's accomplice is there.

368
00:18:48.137 --> 00:18:51.137
But you did say that the possibility is close to zero, right?

369
00:18:51.137 --> 00:18:52.937
I know that if it were you, you would dash right in there

370
00:18:52.937 --> 00:18:54.837
and rescue the man.

371
00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:57.937
Tell me how to do it, Shinichi!

372
00:18:57.937 --> 00:18:59.637
Shinichi!

373
00:19:02.837 --> 00:19:04.937
I'm Yamakawa from TMS Insurance.

374
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:05.937
Please come in!

375
00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:18.437
Yes? Who is it?

376
00:19:18.437 --> 00:19:21.837
I was riding the elevator of the hotel on the opposite side just now

377
00:19:21.837 --> 00:19:22.837
and happened to see

378
00:19:22.837 --> 00:19:25.237
a suspicious looking figure of a person on the veranda here!

379
00:19:25.237 --> 00:19:27.937
Please call the police right away!

380
00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:28.937
Yes!

381
00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:33.337
There it is!

382
00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:38.137
By law, all skyscrapers must be equipped with emergency exit ladders.

383
00:19:38.137 --> 00:19:40.037
Use the ladder from the room right above his room.

384
00:19:52.337 --> 00:19:53.837
Who are you?

385
00:19:53.837 --> 00:19:56.137
You're President Shirota that was kidnapped, aren't you?

386
00:19:56.137 --> 00:19:59.037
I saw your paper planes and came to help you.

387
00:19:59.037 --> 00:20:02.237
When you get there, first lay him down sideways,

388
00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:03.737
and of course don't forget the pillow.

389
00:20:03.737 --> 00:20:07.737
Then dampen a handkerchief with tap water and place it against his mouth.

390
00:20:07.737 --> 00:20:10.137
That's the best emergency aid you can give him.

391
00:20:11.737 --> 00:20:13.437
The ransom.

392
00:20:13.437 --> 00:20:15.337
Was it given to him?

393
00:20:15.337 --> 00:20:16.337
Don't worry.

394
00:20:16.337 --> 00:20:19.437
Everything's been solved, so please rest assured.

395
00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:21.237
Oh, no. Don't tell me that there's an accomplice after all?

396
00:20:25.037 --> 00:20:26.537
I'm...

397
00:20:31.537 --> 00:20:34.337
Okay, we'll take over from here.

398
00:20:34.337 --> 00:20:36.037
We were told about you.

399
00:20:36.037 --> 00:20:38.737
-You're Ms. Ran Mouri, aren't you? -Yes.

400
00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.837
Is the one who called us your boyfriend?

401
00:20:41.837 --> 00:20:43.837
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

402
00:20:43.837 --> 00:20:46.137
Can you relay a message to him?

403
00:20:46.137 --> 00:20:49.037
He needs to state briefly and clearly what the situation is.

404
00:20:49.037 --> 00:20:51.137
I understand that he is panicky

405
00:20:51.137 --> 00:20:55.037
but just yelling isn't do anyone any good.

406
00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:58.637
Well, we really did get the message that he was desperate, though.

407
00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:04.837
The room turned out to be the room of the kidnapper himself,

408
00:21:04.837 --> 00:21:06.537
and he had no accomplice.

409
00:21:06.537 --> 00:21:09.337
He committed crime because he had debts.

410
00:21:09.337 --> 00:21:11.237
President Shirota, who had been confined,

411
00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:12.937
recovered with no complications,

412
00:21:12.937 --> 00:21:16.037
and the queer paper plane case was closed.

413
00:21:19.437 --> 00:21:22.437
That Shinichi panicked and yelled his head off

414
00:21:22.437 --> 00:21:25.537
at the paramedics and police officer?

415
00:21:25.537 --> 00:21:28.237
He was so calm when he was telling me what to do.

416
00:21:28.237 --> 00:21:30.137
It's not like him, is it?

417
00:21:30.137 --> 00:21:32.637
Well, that's because he was worried about his beloved wife

418
00:21:32.637 --> 00:21:34.137
being in a pinch.

419
00:21:34.137 --> 00:21:35.737
It can't be,

420
00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:38.137
he's not that kind of character that guy.

421
00:21:38.137 --> 00:21:41.237
I mean, I'm not his wife.

422
00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:44.337
Well, to be honest, it could have been.

423
00:21:44.337 --> 00:21:47.237
I honestly don't remember what I said back then.

424
00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:50.337
I was all heated up

425
00:21:50.337 --> 00:21:53.237
and I just had one thing in mind.

426
00:21:53.237 --> 00:21:58.537
That I had to protect the tomboy rescuer over my dead body.

427
00:23:28.337 --> 00:23:29.337
Come to think of it,

428
00:23:29.337 --> 00:23:33.437
I wonder who won the deduction match, Subaru or Shinichi?

429
00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:34.537
Beats me.

430
00:23:34.537 --> 00:23:35.837
Deduction match?

431
00:23:35.837 --> 00:23:39.037
Well, President Shirota was safely rescued,

432
00:23:39.037 --> 00:23:42.537
so I'm sure Subaru must be toasting in celebration now.

433
00:23:42.537 --> 00:23:44.137
Toast in celebration?

434
00:23:44.137 --> 00:23:46.437
I found on the kitchen shelf

435
00:23:46.437 --> 00:23:50.037
a bottle of liquor that I didn't see before when I went to clean the house.

436
00:24:06.637 --> 00:24:11.237
"Next Episode" -I'd like you to read my fortune.

437
00:24:11.237 --> 00:24:13.137
It's something I'd really like to know about.

438
00:24:16.637 --> 00:24:17.937
A red-flanked blue-tail.

439
00:24:20.137 --> 00:24:21.837
Ms. Reika?

440
00:24:23.737 --> 00:24:25.237
The door's locked!

441
00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:29.337
In other words, this is...

442
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:30.637
a locked door murder!

443
00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:32.837

Where on earth is my bluebird of happiness?

Sonoko, look over there.

449
00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:01.737
Oh, it flew off.
