On a luxury liner that was set to sail the Pacific Ocean,

3
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:20,027

4
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:23,432
The culprit must be somewhere on this ship.

5
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,723

What is the truth behind this complicated case?

21
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,994
What is the culprit's true objective?

22
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:09,083
And...

23
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,270
