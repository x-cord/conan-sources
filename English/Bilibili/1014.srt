1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,480
Crap, it's 3:30.

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,920
I need to get home soon, or
I'll miss out on my snack.

3
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,540
Your snack? Seriously?

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,420
Huh? What's going on?

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,180
I believe the author Tawake
Shintaro's mansion is around there.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,990
Oh, the mystery writer.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,250
Every book he publishes is a success.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,030
It's no wonder he's got such a nice place.

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,420
Inspector?

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,600
You again?

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,740
If Division One is here, then...

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,890
That's right.

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,490
The author Tawake Shintaro was found
shot to death inside this residence.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,990
What? Shot to death?

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,080
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,650
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,860
Shots are fired at a popular author!

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,930
The shady room is its own mystery!

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,510
Always determining the one truth

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,230
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,970
his name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,610
The Novelist Known as the Demon King

23
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,220
The Novelist Known as the Demon King
"The Novelist Known as the Demon King!"

24
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,040
The Novelist Known as the Demon King

25
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,520
Tawake Shintaro (55)
Mystery Writer

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,920
Tawake Shintaro (55)
Mystery Writer
The victim is Tawake
Shintaro-san, 55 years old.

27
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,040
The victim is Tawake
Shintaro-san, 55 years old.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,790
As you know, he was a mystery writer.

29
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,510
The cause of death was blood loss
from a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,410
We believe the weapon was this shotgun
found on the floor near the body.

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,180
I see.

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,020
The victim was shot while
sleeping on the sofa.

33
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:37,150
The windows of this study face north, so the
lights were kept on even during the daytime.

34
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,250
A room doesn't get sunlight
with north-facing windows.

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,280
According to forensics, the estimated
time of death is around noon.

36
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,750
He was shot with that shotgun, right?

37
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,250
Most likely, since it was
left on the floor there.

38
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,880
Let's review the case.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,210
While Tawake was sleeping on the
sofa, the culprit entered the room,

40
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,970
killed him with a shotgun, dropped the
murder weapon, and fled the scene.

41
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,010
Is that right?

42
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,960
Most likely. Since the glass door in
the living room was partially open,

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,610
we believe the culprit entered
and exited through there.

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,610
Take the body away for an autopsy.

45
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,240
We found no signs that the culprit searched
the room, so we don't believe they were a thief.

46
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,400
Could the motive have been hatred?

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,620
What's this?

48
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,550
It's a bloodstain.

49
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,950
This must've splattered
here when he was shot.

50
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,130
But since there's no blood on the curtains,
that means they were open then, right?

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,260
Did the culprit take the time to close them?

52
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,730
If that's the case, then
why did they do that?

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,370
They were probably trying to
delay the discovery of the body.

54
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,730
It would give them more time to get away.

55
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,110
But who'd be looking in through this window?

56
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,900
Huh?

57
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,880
Isn't it visible from the next house over?

58
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,370
What's up with that house?

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,000
The weather's so nice, but
all the shutters are closed.

60
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,270
Apparently the neighbors moved away
last week. It's currently unoccupied.

61
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,630
It's empty, huh?

62
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,940
Inspector.

63
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,090
There's blood on this as well,

64
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,600
but there isn't a drop on
the floor or wall around it.

65
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,730
Was that stand located
elsewhere during the murder

66
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,480
and moved afterwards by the culprit?

67
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,980
Why would that be necessary?

68
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,610
Inspector Megure, I'm back from
questioning the neighbors.

69
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,250
Nobody saw any suspicious persons.

70
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,050
Also, in the neighborhood...

71
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,110
There wasn't anyone who heard a gunshot.

72
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,960
I'm not surprised no one heard
anything with this racket.

73
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,130
The body was discovered by
Tawake's apprentices, right?

74
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,050
We're having them wait in the living room.

75
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,910
Tawake Shintaro had apprentices, huh?

76
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,620
Akaike Naoya (38)
Tawake's Apprentice

77
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,310
Akaike Naoya (38)
Tawake's Apprentice
These four are Tawake-san's apprentices.

78
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,350
These four are Tawake-san's apprentices.

79
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,600
These four are Tawake-san's apprentices.
Degawa Miyuki (30)
Tawake's Apprentice

80
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,310
Degawa Miyuki (30)
Tawake's Apprentice

81
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,310
Bito Ryunosuke (35)
Tawake's Apprentice

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,310
Chigasaki Haruo (33)
Tawake's Apprentice

83
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,610
These two found the body.

84
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,390
I'm Akaike Naoya.

85
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,950
I'm Degawa Miyuki.

86
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,790
These two are apprentices as well.

87
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,080
They came as quickly as they could
once we reached out to them.

88
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm Bito Ryunosuke.

89
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm Chigasaki Haruo.

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,840
We took turns on a daily rotation
performing odd jobs for Tawake-sensei.

91
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,220
It was my turn today, so I'd been
at the mansion since this morning.

92
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,560
You can leave for now, Akaike.

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,460
There's something I'd like
you to do for me later.

94
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,220
Come back around three.

95
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,590
I've got something to tell you
then, so bring Miyuki with you.

96
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,030
Yes, sir. See you later.

97
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,060
When the two of us returned...

98
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,600
We rushed to call the police.

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,700
Naturally, we haven't
touched the crime scene.

100
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,210
Then it was the culprit who
touched the curtains and stand.

101
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,210
By the way, Akaike-san, we
should probably call them.

102
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:27,570
7 PM
Shiga Dentist

103
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,590
7 PM
Shiga Dentist
You're right.

104
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,160
If we don't call them soon,
it'll cause trouble later.

105
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,340
Excuse me for a moment.

106
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,830
Who would it cause trouble for?

107
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,100
The dentist.

108
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,350
Akaike-san was told to make
an appointment yesterday.

109
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,270
Damn molars.

110
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,090
Thank you.

111
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,030
I was able to make an appointment
for tomorrow night at seven.

112
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,480
But now that he's dead...

113
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,520
I'd like to cancel the
appointment I made yesterday.

114
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,250
Yes.

115
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,120
Tawake-san had bad teeth, huh?

116
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,130
The Demon King won't have to
worry about cavities anymore.

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,510
Demon King?

118
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,260
Why did you call him the Demon King?

119
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,190
They'll find out as they
continue their investigation.

120
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,070
Officer, to tell you the truth, Tawake-sensei
was considered a brilliant hitmaker,

121
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,470
but there's no way he could've written
more than ten books each year.

122
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:38,830
The books he published over the past
few years were actually written by us.

123
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,330
What?

124
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,080
He'd make us write them and
then make a few changes.

125
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,960
He barely wrote anything himself?

126
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,470
It was an open secret in the industry.

127
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,560
We were paid for our work,

128
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,850
but we didn't want to be ghostwriters.

129
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,970
But we couldn't defy him.

130
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,640
If you keep working for me, I'll help
you debut when the time is right.

131
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,970
But if you run away from me,
I'll make sure you never debut!

132
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,110
In any case, his books are popular.

133
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,470
His influence in the publishing
industry was absolute.

134
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,850
But he lied about helping us debut.

135
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,480
We jumped at the opportunity to
apprentice with an author we admired,

136
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,790
but this place was like a labor camp.

137
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,780
So that's why you called him the Demon King.

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,670
All four of you had problems with Tawake-san.

139
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,550
The only way you could become
independent was if he went away.

140
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,760
What?

141
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,140
In other words, you resented him.

142
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,770
You had motives for murder.

143
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,770
You're saying one of us killed him?

144
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,650
Inspector Megure, the
forensics team is leaving.

145
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,680
We'll stay here a little longer.

146
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,670
He was shot using that?

147
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,200
That gun...

148
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,540
It's not inside the locker.

149
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,300
I knew it. That gun
belonged to Tawake-sensei.

150
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,060
The weapon belonged to the victim?

151
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,060
He secretly stored his unlicensed gun here.

152
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,560
And you all knew about it.

153
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,510
I'm telling you, we're innocent.

154
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,420
We know suspicion would
fall on us if we used it.

155
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,820
There's no way we'd do something so foolish.

156
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,750
Yeah.

157
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,430
Perhaps that's exactly why you used it.

158
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,120
If you were the culprit, there's
no way you'd use that gun.

159
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,620
You planned to use that excuse.

160
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,130
Once you start thinking that
way, there's no end to it.

161
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,630
But won't suspicion be cleared
once your alibis are verified?

162
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,260
That's true.

163
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,010
Then could you tell us where you were

164
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,060
and what you were doing around noon?

165
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,400
We were able to confirm Akaike-san's alibi.

166
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,180
We found several people to verify it.

167
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,480
However, we were unable to
confirm Degawa-san, Bito-san,

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,250
and Chigasaki-san's alibis.

169
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,000
Of course you couldn't. We were writing.

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,990
Yeah.

171
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,750
Yeah.

172
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,880
For now, we've narrowed down
four suspects to three.

173
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,920
Wait a minute! You mean...

174
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,960
Naturally, we're not assuming
one of you is the culprit.

175
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,930
But without clear alibis...

176
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,890
Chigasaki, it's because of your stupid
actions that the police suspect me.

177
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,440
What? But it's Miyuki who seems
like she could've done it.

178
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,450
Bito-san is a hundred times
more suspicious than I am.

179
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,670
Cut it out, guys. Don't
point fingers at each other.

180
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,090
I know forced infighting when I see it.

181
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,250
Did the three of you scheme
to kill Tawake together?

182
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,670
What?

183
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,050
Why is this happening?

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,070
Don't cry.

185
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,770
You're able to say that
because you have an alibi.

186
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,340
You're responsible for this, Akaike-san.

187
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,030
You did nothing about the Demon King's
tyranny even though you're the oldest.

188
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,930
That's right.

189
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah.

190
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,090
Got it.

191
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,420
The autopsy found sleeping
pills in the body's system.

192
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,740
Sleeping pills?

193
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,490
The Demon King never took sleeping pills.

194
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,910
The culprit probably
secretly fed them to him,

195
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,340
but why was it necessary to put him to sleep?

196
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,120
More importantly, if it was possible
to feed him sleeping pills,

197
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,880
then they should've been
able to poison him, too.

198
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,260
You're right.

199
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,170
Poisoning him would've been easy.

200
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,720
But they shot him instead.

201
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,600
There must be some reason
the culprit did that.

202
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,960
I see.

203
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,270
I suppose all four of
them are mystery writers.

204
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,100
They're practically mystery-solving experts.

205
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,930
I know.

206
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,970
By using that gun, the culprit was trying to
make it look like one of us was the culprit.

207
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,410
That must be it.

208
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,550
We've been set up!

209
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,590
But something's not right.

210
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,560
Hold on.

211
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,760
This curtain was opened and closed.

212
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,560
Could it be?

213
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,910
If that's the case, then...

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,360
It must've left some trace behind.

215
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,520
Tawake

216
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,730
A piece of aluminum foil.

217
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,500
They made it using this.

218
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,990
But how do I prove it?

219
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,170
Judging by the culprit's personality...

220
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,510
Is it possible that that was...

221
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,580
Shiga Dentist

222
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,580
I knew it.

223
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,620
That just leaves the weather.

224
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,140
It's supposed to be clear
all day tomorrow, too.

225
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,530
That'll work.

226
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,750
The culprit must be one of the apprentices.

227
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,430
Which one of the three
without an alibi is it?

228
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,750
Yeah, he said he figured
out who the culprit is.

229
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,360
Who is it?

230
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,630
Apparently the culprit will show
up at the crime scene tomorrow,

231
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,760
around noon, the same
time the murder happened.

232
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,140
What? The inspector said
to leave for the day?

233
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,910
Yeah.

234
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,030
He asked us to come back tomorrow.

235
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,130
Huh?

236
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,900
The Next Day

237
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,050
Mori-kun, what did you mean when
you said the culprit would show up?

238
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,660
What?

239
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,650
Does that mean everyone
currently present is innocent?

240
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,040
Great!

241
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,960
Inspector, I came like you told me to—

242
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,430
I came like you told me to come, Inspector.

243
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,880
Thank you very much.

244
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,320
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

245
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,570
Everyone, we were distracted by the whodunnit

246
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,610
of who killed Tawake and
overlooked something important:

247
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,980
The howdunnit.

248
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,610
How did the culprit kill Tawake?

249
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,040
What?

250
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,980
They put him to sleep using sleeping pills,

251
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,370
entered the room, and shot him to death.

252
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,820
First, Detective Takagi, remember
what I told you this morning.

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,370
Yes, sir. Chiba.

254
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,610
Here.

255
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,290
That looks about right.

256
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,750
Thank you, Detective Chiba.

257
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,130
Next, the gun has been tied to the stand
that was by the entrance of this room.

258
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,010
It's currently beside the
chair I'm sitting in.

259
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,270
The gun has been loaded with a
paint bullet instead of a live round.

260
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,790
We've set up everything according
to your instructions.

261
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,500
Could this be?

262
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,900
It certainly seems that way.

263
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,440
It's not possible in this study.

264
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,610
After all, the windows face north.

265
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,940
Mister, I'm opening the curtains.

266
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,950
There.

267
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,580
What is that?

268
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,670
A mirror?

269
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,420
It's a concave mirror.

270
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,820
A handmade one made by wrapping a
wooden frame with aluminum foil.

271
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,100
I asked Professor Agasa to make it for me.

272
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,480
The culprit who shot Tawake
should appear soon.

273
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,980
Could it be?

274
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,110
It really is.

275
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,490
Could it be?

276
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,540
The focused sunlight ignited the shell.

277
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,800
Yes. This phenomenon
occasionally causes fires.

278
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,810
This trick has been used
repeatedly in mysteries.

279
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,360
But this trick is normally made
possibly by south-facing rooms...

280
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,710
Was pulled off in this north-facing
study using a mirror.

281
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,560
Indeed.

282
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,940
The culprit used this method to kill Tawake.

283
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,770
Since the culprit didn't want anyone to
notice the gunshot and look into the room,

284
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,440
they waited for this time of day
when the sound would be drowned out.

285
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,630
They used the construction noises.

286
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,130
That explains the sleeping pills, too.

287
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,210
They couldn't hit the victim if he
moved, so they had to put him to sleep.

288
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,210
In order to conceal this method,

289
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,820
after committing the murder, the culprit
moved the stand used to fix the gun in place.

290
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,250
In order to allow the focused
sunlight into the room,

291
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,890
they had to leave the curtains open.

292
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,310
To keep their trick from being discovered,

293
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,090
the culprit closed them
after committing the murder.

294
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,480
Any of the apprentices could
have used this method.

295
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,430
Since it's such a famous trick,
they all knew about it.

296
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,240
However, the reason they
used this method was because

297
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,390
by fabricating an alibi for Tawake's death,

298
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,490
they wouldn't be considered a suspect.

299
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,370
In other words, the person
with an alibi is the culprit.

300
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,500
Which means...

301
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,800
Could it be?

302
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,250
It was Akaike-san?

303
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,260
But Mori-san...

304
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,970
It was your turn yesterday
to perform odd jobs.

305
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,700
You secretly fed Tawake sleeping pills.

306
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,200
I feel so tired for some reason.

307
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,290
You can leave for the day, Akaike.

308
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,090
You took the gun out of the locker,

309
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,370
attached it to the stand,
opened the curtains,

310
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,750
opened the shutters of the house next door,

311
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,140
set up the concave mirror,
fabricated an alibi around noon,

312
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,780
and killed Tawake.

313
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,360
Then you returned to the crime
scene to clean up your trick

314
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,840
and left the glass door in
the living room slightly open

315
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,040
so it would seem like the
culprit entered through it.

316
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,190
You destroyed the concave mirror made
of aluminum foil in the house next door

317
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,820
and closed the shutters.

318
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,830
You had Degawa Miyuki-san accompany you

319
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,380
and discovered the body first

320
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,310
so she could testify that you
didn't touch the crime scene.

321
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,260
This is all speculation, Mori-san.

322
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,980
I borrowed the key from the real estate
office so I could examine the house next door.

323
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,290
Apparently you did, too.

324
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,100
You claimed that Tawake was
thinking about buying it

325
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,180
and wanted to take a look around
inside and made a spare key.

326
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,170
That's speculation as well.

327
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,420
But you gave yourself away, Akaike-san.

328
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,430
I'm talking about the dentist appointment.

329
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,360
I confirmed with them that no
appointment was ever made for Tawake.

330
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,310
When you made the appointment
the other day...

331
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,620
I was able to make an appointment
for tomorrow night at seven.

332
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,570
...you were just pretending, like you
did when you called to cancel yesterday.

333
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,570
I'd like to cancel the appointment
I made yesterday. Yes.

334
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,240
You pretended to call.

335
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,080
It's because you knew there was
no point in making an appointment.

336
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,420
That's right.

337
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,330
You knew beforehand that Tawake would die.

338
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,920
You knew something only
the culprit would know.

339
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,750
Tawake-sensei had missed plenty
of appointments until now.

340
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,550
If I made an appointment
I knew would be canceled,

341
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,810
I would've caused trouble for them again.

342
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,790
That's why I decided to take down

343
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,220
the Demon King who caused nothing
but problems for others myself.

344
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,540
I wanted to free the four of us.

345
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,440
I had to do it.

346
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,400
After all, I'm the oldest.

347
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm disgusted by Tawake Shintaro, too.

348
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,560
I can't believe he was making
his apprentices write his books.

349
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,940
He's like a detective who takes credit
for someone else's mystery-solving.

350
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,810
There's no detective like that!

351
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
Wait, what's happening? I feel
a stinging pain in my chest.

352
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,060
Is he actually experiencing some guilt?

353
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,740
It was a toothpick!

354
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,760
He doesn't feel guilty at all.
