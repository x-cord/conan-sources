1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,042
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,545
The broadcasting of Detective Conan has reached its tenth anniversary.

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,747
From now on...

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,350
We shall sustain our continuous effort and offer you our best...

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,451
TV show.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,453
Movies.

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,355
-And Shounen Sunday too! -And Shounen Sunday too!

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,157
And us, the Youth Detective Squad too!

9
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,359
-What? -What?

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,962
-Please keep rooting for us! -Please keep rooting for us!

11
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,363
That being said!

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,066
Let's ready ourselves for some major hype today!

13
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,769
Singing for us is our beloved Shin...

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,472
Conan Edogawa with "I'm Here"!

15
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,440
Take it away!

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,443
He said, "take it away", but isn't Conan's singing...

17
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,444
No doubt...

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,545
I know, right?

19
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,248
The glasses kid is on it?

20
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,150
No way!

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,851
Hey, for real?

22
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,856
"I'm Here by Conan Edogawa"

23
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:05,165
"When tomorrow comes, my tears will have dried"

24
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:11,471
"My heart will have come around"

25
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:19,746
"For the sake of you, with your beautiful smile"

26
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:25,652
"I will always be here"

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:31,858
"The full moon seems to run red"

28
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,462
Hey, isn't that unfair?

29
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,764
We apologize for the trouble so early in the year.

30
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,066
Sonoko...

31
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,771
Today we have a tenth anniversary extended special story just for you!

32
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,541
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out."

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,143
Sounds ominous.

34
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,346
Chock-full of content for two and a half hours, please enjoy it!

35
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,149
Ran, I don't have any screen time in this episode!

36
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,551
Well then, let's kick off with this intro!

37
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,652
Start.

38
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,959
While flourishing as a high-school detective,

39
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,661
I was shrunken into a child by the Black Organization

40
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,563
with their mysterious drug.

41
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,866
Hailing from an immoral criminal syndicate,

42
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,569
they placed little weight on the lives of others.

43
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,571
"The Black Organization"

44
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,242
As such, the war between myself and the Black Organization

45
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,645
has continued day after day.

46
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,348
Yes. The war fought as Detective Conan Edogawa.

47
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,450
"Ai Haibara"

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,755
The codename for that drug is APOPTOXIN 4869 (APTX 4869).

49
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,458
It's something I developed for the Black Organization.

50
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,262
However, it remains in prototype testing.

51
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,564
Ai Haibara.

52
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,666
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

53
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,868
In the Organization, she was known as Sherry.

54
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,239
I began to distrust the Black Organization

55
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,242
and escaped by taking the drug.

56
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,345
That's after my elder sister was murdered.

57
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,247
By him.

58
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,248
Gin.

59
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,150
"Gin"

60
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,551
This man was precisely the scoundrel

61
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,954
who is responsible for changing me into this state.

62
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,256
"Vodka"

63
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,958
Along with his partner Vodka,

64
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,560
it's likely they've been involved in numerous crimes.

65
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:53,366
By chance, we once ran across Gin's car in the middle of town.

66
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,669
We tried to tail them

67
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,339
but Haibara was soon captured by their compatriots.

68
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,544
Haibara, you're in danger!

69
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,645
They're coming!

70
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,750
I instructed Haibara to drink Paikar,

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,852
an alcohol that would temporarily revert her body to normal.

72
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,454
And tried to aid her escape.

73
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,858
But...

74
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,960
Gin had been lying in wait there.

75
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,868
Hurry into the chimney!

76
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,570
It was exceedingly dangerous,

77
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,339
but somehow, I managed to retrieve Haibara from them.

78
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,446
The FBI agents, Jodie and Akai,

79
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,248
began their investigation in secret.

80
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,651
Those two were after...

81
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,153
"Vermouth" -Vermouth.

82
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,455
Vermouth disguised herself as the school physician,

83
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,358
Dr. Araide, while searching for Sherry.

84
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,964
And eventually, she found us.

85
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,268
I inadvertently requested a house call without suspecting anything

86
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,738
since Ai's cold had become severe.

87
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,840
Our cover was blown.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,343
Both Haibara's and mine.

89
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,145
My apologies for being so last minute,

90
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,247
but would it be all right to take you there now?

91
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,451
I disguised myself as Haibara and accepted Vermouth's invitation.

92
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,853
The FBI also set up a trap.

93
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,057
Vermouth, the FBI and I.

94
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,059
It became a spectacular battle between us three.

95
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,165
Vermouth's plan of targeting Haibara went astray.

96
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,541
From this incident, we acquired some information on the Organization.

97
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,745
Right. It turns out the dial tone for their boss's e-mail address

98
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,348
resembles the "Seven Kids" melody.

99
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,049
"Seven Kids"

100
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,253
And tonight, along with this "Seven Kids" melody,

101
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,556
an assassination plot will soon be put into motion.

102
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,659
Just who is their target?

103
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,370
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

104
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,141
We're proudly presenting you, the next vice president,

105
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,845
candidate for the whole town, Kevin Brown.

106
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,646
Please give a big hand.

107
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:43,669
-Kevin... -Kevin...

108
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,151
I did it!

109
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,058
500 yards.

110
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,160
Cleared.

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,664
It's your turn next!

112
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,063
Just as expected!

113
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,456
600 yards, cleared!

114
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,559
Kevin Brown dies three times!

115
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,960
Four times.

116
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,465
They're pretty good.

117
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,842
Too bad!

118
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,644
If I clear this one...

119
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,547
It's my win!

120
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,654
I got this.

121
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,763
It seems 600 yards is as far as they can go.

122
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,765
That's it...

123
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,767
Gin!

124
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,569
Wait! Let me try once more!

125
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,671
There's no need to.

126
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,544
Our prey this time will be only 200 or 300 yards away at most.

127
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,447
That means...

128
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,249
Chianti.

129
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,051
Korn.

130
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,456
You got work to do.

131
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,839
I don't have all day!

132
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm sorry!

133
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,061
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

134
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,863
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

135
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,564
Finally, a confrontation with the Black Organization!

136
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,768
Dire straits comes one after another and ultimately the target of terror!

137
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,169
He sees through the one and only truth.

138
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,871
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

139
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,839
His name is Detective Conan!

140
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,463
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out"

141
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:54,982
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out"

142
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,228
How was it?

143
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,030
That concludes our "Yoko Okino's Four-Minute Cooking".

144
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,201
Today's guest was Detective Kogoro Mouri.

145
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,403
All right, then!

146
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:10,406
See all at the same time next week!

147
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,207
Great, okay!

148
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,308
That's all for today!

149
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,610
That's right!

150
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,814
You were great, Dad!

151
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,116
Really! It was a live broadcast

152
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,419
but you were so calm and just great!

153
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,921
No... It wasn't all that great.

154
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:33,328
Yoko, you're way too beautiful that the noodles have gotten too hot

155
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:36,799
and excited that the Yoko's Soy Sauce Ramen that I made,

156
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,300
as you can see, have become soggy and soft.

157
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,602
It's knocked out.

158
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,408
You're the one who's soft with women.

159
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,010
We're lucky though!

160
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,413
Since "Morning Live Seven" was filmed on a holiday,

161
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,116
we got to come and watch the program being shot live!

162
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,617
Yep.

163
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,523
Come to think of it, we didn't have breakfast yet.

164
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:02,724
If it's okay with you,

165
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:06,228
why don't we have breakfast at the restaurant at this TV station?

166
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,830
That sounds good!

167
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,499
Then, please go ahead and wait for me there!

168
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,801
I have someone I want you to meet, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,803
So I'll make a call now.

170
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,016
Sorry for the call, this is Okino. Were you sleeping?

171
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,619
What's the matter, Conan?

172
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,422
No, it's nothing.

173
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:35,023
This is bad.

174
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:38,126
Whenever I see somebody using the cell phone,

175
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,729
it immediately brings back memories of Vermouth.

176
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,199
The e-mail address of the of the boss of the Black Organization

177
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,002
who shrunk my body with a drug.

178
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:50,806
That melody, "Seven Kids"...

179
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,614
That e-mail address is one that you should never open

180
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:00,415
since it's Pandora's box.

181
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,518
Yes... I know.

182
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,019
Really?

183
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,622
Maybe I should've made Japanese omelette rice.

184
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,624
Mr. Mouri!

185
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,225
Thank you for waiting!

186
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,429
Yes...

187
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,398
Huh? If I remember correctly,

188
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:18,000
you're usually sitting on the side of the screen

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,902
on the "Sunday Night News".

190
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:23,105
Yes! She's Announcer, Rena Mizunashi!

191
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:25,607
Nice meeting you.

192
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,214
I'm the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri!

193
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:36,018
I'm his daughter, Ran.

194
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,519
This is Conan.

195
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,921
Hello!

196
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,422
Pleased to meet you.

197
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,723
Come on!

198
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,729
Hey, Yoko?

199
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,131
Are you serious about discussing something like that

200
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:52,000
to a famed detective?

201
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,402
Don't worry!

202
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:56,505
I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will be able to work something out!

203
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,706
But...

204
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,409
Is something bothering you?

205
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:01,810
Yes.

206
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,913
Come on, Yoko...

207
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,616
Ring... Ring the bell and run away?

208
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:10,919
Are you asking me to catch the one who is doing that for you?

209
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,121
See... It's rude to ask him something like that, after all!

210
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:16,325
But it doesn't seem to be just a simple prank.

211
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:18,827
What do you mean?

212
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,028
Well...

213
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:23,198
The person rings the bell only early in the morning on Saturdays.

214
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,903
I was waiting again today in hopes of finding out who was doing it

215
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,504
but when I opened the door...

216
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,308
as soon as I heard the doorbell rang,

217
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:36,812
there was no one in sight anywhere.

218
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:42,618
-No way! -I've been afraid to open the door since then.

219
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,821
You mean it happened where you live?

220
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,424
Yes. At my condominium in Haido-cho.

221
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,525
If it's okay with you,

222
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,427
why don't you have Mr. Mouri go over to your place

223
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,130
and check things out?

224
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,700
I can't go because I have work after this but...

225
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,902
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

226
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,004
What?

227
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:10,512
There's nowhere for people to hide near the door.

228
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,513
Yeah.

229
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,916
Why don't we try ringing the doorbell then?

230
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,421
Are you ready?

231
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,224
Then, I'm going to ring the doorbell.

232
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,703
Dad?

233
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,305
Are you all right?

234
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:40,409
Yes, sort of...

235
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:44,513
But now we know that there's practically no time to hide.

236
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:48,016
Yeah. Could you tell me more about it inside?

237
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,619
Sure. Please come in.

238
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,020
Sorry for intruding.

239
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,725
Let me get you slippers.

240
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,427
I don't need slippers. Thank you.

241
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,529
Of course, there're no slippers for kid!

242
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,431
Thank you!

243
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,299
This way, please.

244
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,701
Sorry for intruding.

245
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:11,807
You sure have a lot of locks, don't you?

246
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,911
Really. You got four locks all together.

247
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,513
Living alone as a woman could be a bit dangerous.

248
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:20,716
Well, I guess so.

249
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,217
Would you like something to drink?

250
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:23,919
Coffee, please.

251
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,921
I'll help you!

252
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,022
Okay!

253
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:34,229
I guess I'll set a wiretap to pick up the sound at the front entrance

254
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:37,699
when the doorbell rings.

255
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,303
I'll set it up on the wall outside the door.

256
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,705
If I put it here, I can easily retrieve it later.

257
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:48,610
Just in case it peels off and gets lost,

258
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,713
I'll wrap this transmitter in the chewing gum too.

259
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,622
Okay, all set!

260
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,629
Just now...

261
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,998
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

262
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,701
Conan?

263
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,403
Will juice be okay?

264
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:16,705
Oh, yep!

265
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,006
Is anything the matter?

266
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,108
No, it's nothing.

267
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,511
Okay then, juice for you.

268
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:25,714
Is it just my imagination?

269
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:26,815
Or...

270
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:40,729
So somebody's been ringing your doorbell from two months ago.

271
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:45,500
Yes. It happens every Saturday at around 6:30 am since then.

272
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,103
Did something happen two months ago?

273
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,705
The only thing I remember is that,

274
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:53,608
I was shifted from the program "Morning Live Seven"

275
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,410
to "Sunday Night News".

276
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,113
Although I'm not the main announcer for either program.

277
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,917
You got to know Ms. Yoko doing "Morning Live Seven", then?

278
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,920
Yes. We were both working the program

279
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,023
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

280
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:10,425
If so, the prank could've started being played on you

281
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,028
since two months ago.

282
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:16,398
Yes. Because when I was still doing "Morning Live seven",

283
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:19,000
I used to leave for work at 4 am on Saturday.

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,704
Is the prank being played on you throughout the two months?

285
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:25,307
It is. Every Saturday.

286
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,109
Oh! But there was just one time that nothing happened.

287
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,716
I was abroad the week before last from Monday to Friday to cover news.

288
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:38,820
On the Saturday, a day after I came home, nothing happened.

289
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,124
It could be that I was tired and couldn't hear the doorbell, though.

290
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:47,229
And on the Tuesday after the three day holiday in October,

291
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,730
the same prank was played.

292
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,001
That was the only day the prank was played on Tuesday, though.

293
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,905
And just once there was something weird outside the door.

294
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:58,807
Something weird?

295
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:02,010
A bottle with some drug inside was found outside the door.

296
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,613
I had a doctor acquaintance check it after that

297
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:07,015
and found out that it was a sleeping drug.

298
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,817
Sleeping drug?

299
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,720
It's a stalker.

300
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,522
It's probably a warning that he's planning to put you to sleep

301
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,024
and do evil things to you.

302
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,225
No way.

303
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,328
Did you notice anything else left by the door?

304
00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:22,330
Besides the sleeping drug.

305
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,999
Something else?

306
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,003
What is it?

307
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:29,504
Around three nights ago,

308
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,406
it seems that someone was in the house next door

309
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,308
that is supposedly vacant.

310
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:34,509
What?

311
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:37,412
Three nights ago is Tuesday, right?

312
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:40,015
Yes. At a little before midnight,

313
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:42,717
I finished taking a bath and was relaxing on the bed.

314
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:56,798
I thought next door was supposed to be vacant

315
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,600
so I take a look from the veranda.

316
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:05,707
It was pitch dark next door,

317
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,610
so I thought that the sound came from outside.

318
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,724
So I called the management company in the morning

319
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:25,627
but I was told, "You must've been dreaming".

320
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:31,099
There's a high chance that the man is a stalker.

321
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:36,805
That man had the spare key to the house next door.

322
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:38,807
Not only three nights ago,

323
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:42,010
but especially on Friday nights he slept in the house next door.

324
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,614
And the following day, he rang your doorbell.

325
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,615
I see. If it's the house next door,

326
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:50,819
he can hide right after ringing the doorbell.

327
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:55,724
That's why you couldn't find the culprit.

328
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:59,227
Since when was the house next door vacant?

329
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:03,398
Probably from about six months ago, I think.

330
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:10,505
Just as I thought, it's locked.

331
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:15,210
We may be able to get clues on the man if we go inside.

332
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,813
Why don't we call the management company and have them open the door?

333
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:21,016
But from the feeling I got last time,

334
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:23,018
I don't think that they'll help at all.

335
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:47,809
No good.

336
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:12,100
"Ki-Mi-Wa"

337
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,804
"Ki-Mi-Wa"?
