1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,040
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,540
The broadcasting of Detective Conan has reached its tenth anniversary.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,740
From now on...

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,340
We shall sustain our continuous effort and offer you our best...

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,440
TV show.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,440
Movies.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,340
-And Shounen Sunday too! -And Shounen Sunday too!

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,140
And us, the Youth Detective Squad too!

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,340
-What? -What?

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,940
-Please keep rooting for us! -Please keep rooting for us!

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,340
That being said!

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,040
Let's ready ourselves for some major hype today!

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,740
Singing for us is our beloved Shin...

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,440
Conan Edogawa with "I'm Here"!

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
Take it away!

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
He said, "take it away", but isn't Conan's singing...

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
No doubt...

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,540
I know, right?

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,240
The glasses kid is on it?

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,140
No way!

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,840
Hey, for real?

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,840
"I'm Here by Conan Edogawa"

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,140
"When tomorrow comes, my tears will have dried"

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,440
"My heart will have come around"

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,740
"For the sake of you, with your beautiful smile"

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,640
"I will always be here"

27
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,840
"The full moon seems to run red"

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,440
Hey, isn't that unfair?

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,740
We apologize for the trouble so early in the year.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,040
Sonoko...

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,740
Today we have a tenth anniversary extended special story just for you!

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,540
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out."

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,140
Sounds ominous.

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,340
Chock-full of content for two and a half hours, please enjoy it!

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
Ran, I don't have any screen time in this episode!

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,540
Well then, let's kick off with this intro!

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,640
Start.

38
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,140
While flourishing as a high-school detective,

39
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,840
I was shrunken into a child by the Black Organization

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,740
with their mysterious drug.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
Hailing from an immoral criminal syndicate,

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,740
they placed little weight on the lives of others.

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,740
"The Black Organization"

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,440
As such, the war between myself and the Black Organization

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,840
has continued day after day.

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,540
Yes. The war fought as Detective Conan Edogawa.

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
"Ai Haibara"

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,940
The codename for that drug is APOPTOXIN 4869 (APTX 4869).

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,640
It's something I developed for the Black Organization.

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,440
However, it remains in prototype testing.

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,740
Ai Haibara.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,840
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,040
In the Organization, she was known as Sherry.

54
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,440
I began to distrust the Black Organization

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
and escaped by taking the drug.

56
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,540
That's after my elder sister was murdered.

57
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,440
By him.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Gin.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,340
"Gin"

60
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,740
This man was precisely the scoundrel

61
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,140
who is responsible for changing me into this state.

62
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,440
"Vodka"

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,140
Along with his partner Vodka,

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,740
it's likely they've been involved in numerous crimes.

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,540
By chance, we once ran across Gin's car in the middle of town.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
We tried to tail them

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,540
but Haibara was soon captured by their compatriots.

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,740
Haibara, you're in danger!

69
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,840
They're coming!

70
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,940
I instructed Haibara to drink Paikar,

71
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,040
an alcohol that would temporarily revert her body to normal.

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
And tried to aid her escape.

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,040
But...

74
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,140
Gin had been lying in wait there.

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Hurry into the chimney!

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,740
It was exceedingly dangerous,

77
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,540
but somehow, I managed to retrieve Haibara from them.

78
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,640
The FBI agents, Jodie and Akai,

79
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
began their investigation in secret.

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,840
Those two were after...

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,340
"Vermouth" -Vermouth.

82
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,640
Vermouth disguised herself as the school physician,

83
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,540
Dr. Araide, while searching for Sherry.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,140
And eventually, she found us.

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,440
I inadvertently requested a house call without suspecting anything

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,940
since Ai's cold had become severe.

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,040
Our cover was blown.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,540
Both Haibara's and mine.

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,340
My apologies for being so last minute,

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,440
but would it be all right to take you there now?

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,640
I disguised myself as Haibara and accepted Vermouth's invitation.

92
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,040
The FBI also set up a trap.

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
Vermouth, the FBI and I.

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
It became a spectacular battle between us three.

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,340
Vermouth's plan of targeting Haibara went astray.

96
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,740
From this incident, we acquired some information on the Organization.

97
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,940
Right. It turns out the dial tone for their boss's e-mail address

98
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,540
resembles the "Seven Kids" melody.

99
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,240
"Seven Kids"

100
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,440
And tonight, along with this "Seven Kids" melody,

101
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,740
an assassination plot will soon be put into motion.

102
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Just who is their target?

103
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,540
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

104
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,340
We're proudly presenting you, the next vice president,

105
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,040
candidate for the whole town, Kevin Brown.

106
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,840
Please give a big hand.

107
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,840
-Kevin... -Kevin...

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,340
I did it!

109
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,240
500 yards.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,340
Cleared.

111
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,840
It's your turn next!

112
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,240
Just as expected!

113
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,640
600 yards, cleared!

114
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,740
Kevin Brown dies three times!

115
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,140
Four times.

116
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,640
They're pretty good.

117
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,040
Too bad!

118
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,840
If I clear this one...

119
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,740
It's my win!

120
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,840
I got this.

121
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,940
It seems 600 yards is as far as they can go.

122
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
That's it...

123
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Gin!

124
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,740
Wait! Let me try once more!

125
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,840
There's no need to.

126
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,740
Our prey this time will be only 200 or 300 yards away at most.

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
That means...

128
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,440
Chianti.

129
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,240
Korn.

130
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,640
You got work to do.

131
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,040
I don't have all day!

132
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,140
I'm sorry!

133
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

134
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,040
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

135
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,740
Finally, a confrontation with the Black Organization!

136
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,940
Dire straits comes one after another and ultimately the target of terror!

137
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

138
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

139
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
His name is Detective Conan!

140
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,640
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out"

141
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:23,340
"Black Impact! The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out"

142
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,690
Then, please go ahead and wait for me there!

143
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,990
I have someone I want you to meet, Mr. Mouri.

144
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,990
So I'll make a call now.

145
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,190
Sorry for the call, this is Okino. Were you sleeping?

146
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,790
What's the matter, Conan?

147
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,590
No, it's nothing.

148
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,190
This is bad.

149
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,290
Whenever I see somebody using the cell phone,

150
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,890
it immediately brings back memories of Vermouth.

151
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,390
The e-mail address of the of the boss of the Black Organization

152
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,190
who shrunk my body with a drug.

153
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,990
That melody, "Seven Kids"...

154
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,790
That e-mail address is one that you should never open

155
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,590
since it's Pandora's box.

156
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,690
Yes... I know.

157
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,190
Really?

158
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,790
Maybe I should've made Japanese omelette rice.

159
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,790
Mr. Mouri!

160
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,390
Thank you for waiting!

161
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,590
Yes...

162
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,590
Huh? If I remember correctly,

163
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,190
you're usually sitting on the side of the screen

164
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,090
on the "Sunday Night News".

165
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,290
Yes! She's Announcer, Rena Mizunashi!

166
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,790
Nice meeting you.

167
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,390
I'm the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri!

168
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,190
I'm his daughter, Ran.

169
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,690
This is Conan.

170
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,090
Hello!

171
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,590
Pleased to meet you.

172
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,890
Come on!

173
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,890
Hey, Yoko?

174
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,290
Are you serious about discussing something like that

175
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,190
to a famed detective?

176
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,590
Don't worry!

177
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,690
I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will be able to work something out!

178
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,890
But...

179
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,590
Is something bothering you?

180
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,990
Yes.

181
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,090
Come on, Yoko...

182
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,790
Ring... Ring the bell and run away?

183
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,090
Are you asking me to catch the one who is doing that for you?

184
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,290
See... It's rude to ask him something like that, after all!

185
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,490
But it doesn't seem to be just a simple prank.

186
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,990
What do you mean?

187
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,190
Well...

188
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,390
The person rings the bell only early in the morning on Saturdays.

189
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,090
I was waiting again today in hopes of finding out who was doing it

190
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,690
but when I opened the door...

191
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,490
as soon as I heard the doorbell rang,

192
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,990
there was no one in sight anywhere.

193
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,790
-No way! -I've been afraid to open the door since then.

194
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,990
You mean it happened where you live?

195
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,590
Yes. At my condominium in Haido-cho.

196
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,690
If it's okay with you,

197
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,590
why don't you have Mr. Mouri go over to your place

198
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,290
and check things out?

199
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,890
I can't go because I have work after this but...

200
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,090
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

201
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,190
What?

202
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,690
There's nowhere for people to hide near the door.

203
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,690
Yeah.

204
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,090
Why don't we try ringing the doorbell then?

205
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,590
Are you ready?

206
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,390
Then, I'm going to ring the doorbell.

207
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,890
Dad?

208
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,490
Are you all right?

209
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Yes, sort of...

210
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,690
But now we know that there's practically no time to hide.

211
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,190
Yeah. Could you tell me more about it inside?

212
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,790
Sure. Please come in.

213
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,190
Sorry for intruding.

214
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,890
Let me get you slippers.

215
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,590
I don't need slippers. Thank you.

216
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,690
Of course, there're no slippers for kid!

217
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,590
Thank you!

218
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,490
This way, please.

219
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,890
Sorry for intruding.

220
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,990
You sure have a lot of locks, don't you?

221
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,090
Really. You got four locks all together.

222
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,690
Living alone as a woman could be a bit dangerous.

223
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,890
Well, I guess so.

224
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,390
Would you like something to drink?

225
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,090
Coffee, please.

226
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,090
I'll help you!

227
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,190
Okay!

228
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,390
I guess I'll set a wiretap to pick up the sound at the front entrance

229
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,890
when the doorbell rings.

230
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,490
I'll set it up on the wall outside the door.

231
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,890
If I put it here, I can easily retrieve it later.

232
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,790
Just in case it peels off and gets lost,

233
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,890
I'll wrap this transmitter in the chewing gum too.

234
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,790
Okay, all set!

235
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,790
Just now...

236
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,190
Just now, I feel like I was being watched by someone.

237
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,890
Conan?

238
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,590
Will juice be okay?

239
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,890
Oh, yep!

240
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,190
Is anything the matter?

241
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,290
No, it's nothing.

242
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,690
Okay then, juice for you.

243
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,890
Is it just my imagination?

244
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,990
Or...

245
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,890
So somebody's been ringing your doorbell from two months ago.

246
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,690
Yes. It happens every Saturday at around 6:30 am since then.

247
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,290
Did something happen two months ago?

248
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,890
The only thing I remember is that,

249
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,790
I was shifted from the program "Morning Live Seven"

250
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,590
to "Sunday Night News".

251
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,290
Although I'm not the main announcer for either program.

252
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,090
You got to know Ms. Yoko doing "Morning Live Seven", then?

253
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,090
Yes. We were both working the program

254
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,190
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

255
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,590
If so, the prank could've started being played on you

256
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,190
since two months ago.

257
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,590
Yes. Because when I was still doing "Morning Live seven",

258
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,190
I used to leave for work at 4 am on Saturday.

259
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,890
Is the prank being played on you throughout the two months?

260
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,490
It is. Every Saturday.

261
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,290
Oh! But there was just one time that nothing happened.

262
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,890
I was abroad the week before last from Monday to Friday to cover news.

263
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,990
On the Saturday, a day after I came home, nothing happened.

264
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,290
It could be that I was tired and couldn't hear the doorbell, though.

265
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,390
And on the Tuesday after the three day holiday in October,

266
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,890
the same prank was played.

267
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,190
That was the only day the prank was played on Tuesday, though.

268
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,090
And just once there was something weird outside the door.

269
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,990
Something weird?

270
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,190
A bottle with some drug inside was found outside the door.

271
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,790
I had a doctor acquaintance check it after that

272
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,190
and found out that it was a sleeping drug.

273
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,990
Sleeping drug?

274
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,890
It's a stalker.

275
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,690
It's probably a warning that he's planning to put you to sleep

276
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,190
and do evil things to you.

277
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,390
No way.

278
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,490
Did you notice anything else left by the door?

279
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,490
Besides the sleeping drug.

280
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,190
Something else?

281
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,190
What is it?

282
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,690
Around three nights ago,

283
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,590
it seems that someone was in the house next door

284
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,490
that is supposedly vacant.

285
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,690
What?

286
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,590
Three nights ago is Tuesday, right?

287
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,190
Yes. At a little before midnight,

288
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,890
I finished taking a bath and was relaxing on the bed.

289
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,990
I thought next door was supposed to be vacant

290
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,790
so I take a look from the veranda.

291
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,890
It was pitch dark next door,

292
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,790
so I thought that the sound came from outside.

293
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,890
So I called the management company in the morning

294
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,790
but I was told, "You must've been dreaming".

295
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,290
There's a high chance that the man is a stalker.

296
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,990
That man had the spare key to the house next door.

297
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,990
Not only three nights ago,

298
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,190
but especially on Friday nights he slept in the house next door.

299
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,790
And the following day, he rang your doorbell.

300
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,790
I see. If it's the house next door,

301
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,990
he can hide right after ringing the doorbell.

302
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,890
That's why you couldn't find the culprit.

303
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,390
Since when was the house next door vacant?

304
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,590
Probably from about six months ago, I think.

305
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,690
Just as I thought, it's locked.

306
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,390
We may be able to get clues on the man if we go inside.

307
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,990
Why don't we call the management company and have them open the door?

308
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,190
But from the feeling I got last time,

309
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,190
I don't think that they'll help at all.

310
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,990
No good.

311
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,290
"Ki-Mi-Wa"

312
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,990
"Ki-Mi-Wa"?
