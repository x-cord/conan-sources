1
00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:10.712
Which one is his?

2
00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.512
It's that black bag in the back.

3
00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:18.812
Is something wrong?

4
00:00:18.812 --> 00:00:24.312
No. I just remembered something strange he said.

5
00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:26.512
Something strange?

6
00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:31.012
It was about a week ago, he said he forgot his bag at the studio

7
00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:34.212
and someone cut it to shreds.

8
00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:37.212
That's why he bought a new one

9
00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:42.512
for this trip.

10
00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:45.512
Maybe someone was after those negatives.

11
00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.112
That's why it happened.

12
00:00:48.112 --> 00:00:53.612
Passport, camera, film, sunglasses, 3 packs of cigarettes,

13
00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:58.512
wallet, towel, 2 magazines, boarding pass and a wristwatch.

14
00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:01.512
Nothing that appears to be the weapons.

15
00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:04.012
Shinichi.

16
00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:06.712
Really?

17
00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:11.512
What's this? Kazuhiro Ohtaka.

18
00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:15.912
Mr. Ohtaka, is he the fellow who won

19
00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:19.112
the Nichiuri Newspaper's Photo contest 3 years ago?

20
00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:23.012
Well, yes. That's him.

21
00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:24.312
I knew it.

22
00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:25.812
What is it, Takagi?

23
00:01:25.812 --> 00:01:29.312
Look, it's that picture of a mother trapped in the fire,

24
00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:31.812
she's handing her daughter

25
00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:34.312
to the fireman on the ladder.

26
00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.312
Forget about that. That's not the issue here.

27
00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:42.112
Are we or aren't we cleared? Which is it?

28
00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:46.112
But you four were the only ones who went to the toilet

29
00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:48.412
at the time the crime was committed.

30
00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:50.412
That boy gave the statement.

31
00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:56.712
I'll bet that kid who thinks he's a detective

32
00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:59.912
fell asleep and missed a couple of people.

33
00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:03.912
It seems you've read a lot of books and did a lot of studying

34
00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:05.912
but this is a real murder.

35
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:07.612
It's not like your book.

36
00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.712
Children should behave,

37
00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:13.812
go back to your seat and take a nap.

38
00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:17.412
Shinichi, why don't you say something?

39
00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:20.012
What is it with this case?

40
00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:22.212
The weapon can't be found

41
00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:25.312
and all their alibis just don't add up.

42
00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:28.912
How about telling us the truth?

43
00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:29.912
What?

44
00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:32.212
It's you, isn't it? You killed him.

45
00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:34.412
Hey, come on now.

46
00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:39.012
The only one among all of us obviously telling a lie is you.

47
00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:42.512
I saw you.

48
00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:45.012
When this girl was asking the stewardess for medicine,

49
00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:48.812
the victim was asleep and your seat in the back of him was empty.

50
00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:51.212
You're a liar.

51
00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:55.612
I am not lying. The truth is... the truth is we both...

52
00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:58.112
There... that's the stewardess.

53
00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:02.012
She and l that stewardess is my witness.

54
00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:06.612
And that's his statement.

55
00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:08.512
Is it true?

56
00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:13.312
Yes, this passenger was wandering around the cabin,

57
00:03:13.312 --> 00:03:15.012
so I called out to him.

58
00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:18.912
He asked me to caution a passenger

59
00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:21.412
in the non-smoking section who was smoking.

60
00:03:21.412 --> 00:03:25.412
And? Was this man in this seat when you got there?

61
00:03:25.412 --> 00:03:29.312
No, I don't believe so.

62
00:03:29.312 --> 00:03:32.612
Hey, you. Are you blind or something?

63
00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.412
You were the one who brought the medicine, weren't you?

64
00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:36.712
Yes.

65
00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:40.312
You saw me sleeping in my seat, didn't you?

66
00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:45.112
No, I don't remember clearly.

67
00:03:45.112 --> 00:03:46.612
What?

68
00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:49.712
Excuse me, when you brought the medicine,

69
00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:51.812
could it be possible that...

70
00:03:54.012 --> 00:03:56.712
Could that have happened?

71
00:03:56.712 --> 00:04:00.612
Yes, that's right. But I thought it was my imagination.

72
00:04:01.612 --> 00:04:05.312
There's no doubt about it.

73
00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:07.612
That's the killer.

74
00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:11.612
That'll explain, everyone, except the killer's story

75
00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:14.612
and why a piece of negative was on the seat,

76
00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:17.212
the unexplainable blood on the toilet wall,

77
00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:21.512
and why the victim's pocket was wet.

78
00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:24.412
But why?

79
00:04:24.412 --> 00:04:27.112
Why didn't the killer have the weapon?

80
00:04:28.812 --> 00:04:31.812
Because it couldn't be gotten rid of. Is that possible?

81
00:04:31.812 --> 00:04:34.412
Is it something the owner would miss if it was gone?

82
00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:40.712
Wait a minute, I just realized that person did...

83
00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:44.412
Hey. Shinichi, Inspector Megure's calling you.

84
00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:47.412
He wants you to go around the cabin

85
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:50.112
and see if anyone else went to the toilet.

86
00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:54.012
Never mind that. Ran, you're in high school, aren't you?

87
00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:56.612
What? Of course, I am.

88
00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:58.812
Then let me ask you...

89
00:05:02.912 --> 00:05:04.512
What?

90
00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:10.112
Tell me quick. I'm embarrassed to ask this.

91
00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:14.612
Yes, that's right. Most of them are like that now.

92
00:05:14.612 --> 00:05:16.812
I see. So that's what it was.

93
00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:19.012
What do you mean by that?

94
00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:21.812
Why do you look so satisfied?

95
00:05:21.812 --> 00:05:24.212
I finally figured it out.

96
00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:26.512
I know what the killer's trump card is.

97
00:05:26.512 --> 00:05:28.812
What was used to snuff the life out of the victim?

98
00:05:32.012 --> 00:05:36.612
At any rate, the only one who acted suspiciously

99
00:05:36.612 --> 00:05:39.212
is Mr. Washinuma, only you.

100
00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:40.912
No...

101
00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:43.212
You're wrong, Inspector Megure.

102
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:48.012
He's not the killer.

103
00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:50.812
He was never near the crime scene

104
00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:53.912
so his chances of being the killer are zero.

105
00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:55.312
But...

106
00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:57.812
See? What a relief.

107
00:05:57.812 --> 00:06:02.312
I had nothing to do with all of this.

108
00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:05.912
No, that's not exactly true.

109
00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:08.612
Mr. Washinuma.

110
00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:11.012
You were taken advantage of without you knowing.

111
00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:14.012
By a person in that group.

112
00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:16.612
The one person who gave false testimony,

113
00:06:16.612 --> 00:06:18.412
the killer.

114
00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:20.212
Which means, inspector,

115
00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:23.812
it was Miss Tachikawa who said she went to the toilet

116
00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:25.412
to check on the victim and knocked on the door

117
00:06:25.412 --> 00:06:28.012
and got a knock in reply.

118
00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:29.512
Wait just a minute.

119
00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:32.712
No, she wasn't lying.

120
00:06:33.812 --> 00:06:38.212
There really was someone inside the toilet at that time...

121
00:06:38.212 --> 00:06:40.312
Inside with the victim.

122
00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:42.812
Mr. Crow. Yes, you.

123
00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:46.312
Are you sure about that?

124
00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:51.712
He put his hand into Mr. Ohtaka's pocket looking for the negatives

125
00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:56.812
and realized the cologne on his wrist rubbed onto the pants.

126
00:06:57.812 --> 00:07:00.712
So he hurriedly washed his hands to wash the cologne off,

127
00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:01.812
then he wet his handkerchief

128
00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:05.812
to wipe the telltale scent from the pants.

129
00:07:06.812 --> 00:07:10.512
The proof is, there's no cologne on his wrist.

130
00:07:10.512 --> 00:07:13.912
That's not what I'd consider proof.

131
00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:16.712
Besides, to get his statement, we'll have to ask him in English.

132
00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:19.312
No, he speaks Japanese.

133
00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.612
Isn't that right, Mr. Crow?

134
00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:26.612
The boy's right.

135
00:07:27.612 --> 00:07:28.612
He spoke...

136
00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:32.412
Japanese.

137
00:07:32.412 --> 00:07:34.012
Of course he did.

138
00:07:34.012 --> 00:07:35.912
He intended to buy those negatives

139
00:07:35.912 --> 00:07:39.912
with the check from the National Bank.

140
00:07:40.012 --> 00:07:41.412
Buy?

141
00:07:41.412 --> 00:07:43.312
That's right.

142
00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:48.612
Senator Dickson himself asked me to.

143
00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:51.512
So was it you? Did you kill Ohtaka?

144
00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:53.612
No, he's not the killer.

145
00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:59.412
Because when he went into the toilet, Mr. Ohtaka was already dead.

146
00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:03.512
What was that?

147
00:08:03.512 --> 00:08:05.912
Isn't that right, Mr. Crow?

148
00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:11.612
Yes, when I heard he had gone to the toilet.

149
00:08:11.612 --> 00:08:13.612
I thought it was my chance to make a deal with him.

150
00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:16.712
But there was no answer when I knocked

151
00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.112
so I opened the door and went in.

152
00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:21.012
He was dead.

153
00:08:21.012 --> 00:08:24.312
Of course, I didn't get the negatives.

154
00:08:24.312 --> 00:08:27.212
Then it was you who answered my knock?

155
00:08:27.212 --> 00:08:28.512
Yes.

156
00:08:28.512 --> 00:08:30.712
Hey, don't be fooled by this.

157
00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:34.712
He's just confirming that kid's guesswork.

158
00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:38.512
Guesswork? Absolutely not.

159
00:08:38.512 --> 00:08:42.112
There were bloodstains on the toilet wall,

160
00:08:42.112 --> 00:08:46.412
yet there was no blood on the victim's back,

161
00:08:46.412 --> 00:08:48.612
although he was leaning on the stains.

162
00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:52.412
This indicates someone else moved the body

163
00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:55.912
after some time had passed.

164
00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:58.512
Someone who found the body but didn't notify anyone.

165
00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:00.412
The only reason I can come up with for moving the body is,

166
00:09:00.412 --> 00:09:03.812
to look for those negatives.

167
00:09:03.812 --> 00:09:07.612
But unable to find them, the person searched his pants pocket.

168
00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:10.912
The only one who would do that

169
00:09:10.912 --> 00:09:12.712
would be someone sitting in front of the victim.

170
00:09:12.712 --> 00:09:14.912
Someone who couldn't see what the victim was doing,

171
00:09:14.912 --> 00:09:17.412
that could only be Mr. Crow.

172
00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:19.012
Yes, I get it.

173
00:09:19.012 --> 00:09:21.712
Alright then, who did it? Who's the killer?

174
00:09:21.712 --> 00:09:24.612
We have now eliminated Mr. Crow,

175
00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:27.112
Miss Tachikawa who was outside knocking on the door.

176
00:09:28.212 --> 00:09:32.212
Which leaves us Mr Ukai and Miss Amano.

177
00:09:34.412 --> 00:09:36.512
This is the crucial point.

178
00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:41.912
Mr. Ukai testified that when Miss Amano asked for the medicine,

179
00:09:41.912 --> 00:09:45.812
Mr. Washinuma's seat behind the victim was unoccupied.

180
00:09:45.812 --> 00:09:47.812
I'm sure about that.

181
00:09:47.812 --> 00:09:51.812
And I'm telling you, I was there all along, sleeping.

182
00:09:52.012 --> 00:09:56.912
He's right. Mr. Washinuma was asleep in his seat.

183
00:09:56.912 --> 00:09:59.512
The killer put a knit cap on his head

184
00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:02.312
and covered his eyes with an eye mask.

185
00:10:02.312 --> 00:10:03.312
What was that...

186
00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:05.312
That style. Do you mean...

187
00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:09.212
That's right, that is Mr. Ohtaka's sleeping style.

188
00:10:10.112 --> 00:10:13.712
After killing him, instead of return to their own seat,

189
00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:15.512
the killer sat next to Mr. Washinuma

190
00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:17.112
and made him up to look like Mr. Ohtaka,

191
00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:18.912
then called the stewardess.

192
00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:22.812
To give the illusion Mr. Ohtaka was still alive at that time.

193
00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:25.612
Hold it, you mean...

194
00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:27.212
I don't believe it.

195
00:10:27.212 --> 00:10:28.312
That's right.

196
00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:30.712
The person responsible for killing Mr. Ohtaka

197
00:10:30.712 --> 00:10:34.212
and using Mr. Washinuma to fake an alibi is...

198
00:10:45.054 --> 00:10:47.954
Tsugumi Amano! It's you!

199
00:10:47.954 --> 00:10:49.254
No way, he's kidding, right?

200
00:10:49.254 --> 00:10:50.554
Tsugumi?

201
00:10:51.754 --> 00:10:55.254
Well, we can't blame the stewardess for making a mistake.

202
00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.954
After all, the cabin was dark.

203
00:10:56.954 --> 00:10:59.754
And the only part of his face not covered by the blanket was the nose up.

204
00:10:59.754 --> 00:11:03.354
While the stewardess was getting the medicine,

205
00:11:03.354 --> 00:11:05.154
Miss Amano went back to her own seat.

206
00:11:05.154 --> 00:11:08.054
Then woke Miss Tachikawa by moaning exaggeratedly.

207
00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:20.054
Making sure she noticed Mr.Ohtaka's seat was empty.

208
00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:22.554
This gave Miss Tachikawa and the stewardess the wrong impression

209
00:11:22.554 --> 00:11:25.954
about when Mr Ohtaka went to the toilet.

210
00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:29.354
Then, the empty seat I saw...

211
00:11:29.354 --> 00:11:33.354
Just by chance, there was an empty seat behind Mr. Washinuma.

212
00:11:33.454 --> 00:11:37.454
But she wouldn't have been able to use this trick

213
00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:39.254
if the seat was occupied.

214
00:11:39.254 --> 00:11:42.154
She made several reservations and unless she cancelled,

215
00:11:42.154 --> 00:11:44.454
the seats would remain empty.

216
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.454
If the medicine she gave Mr. Washinuma was sleeping pills

217
00:11:47.454 --> 00:11:51.254
rather than air sickness pills, he wouldn't wake up so easily.

218
00:11:51.254 --> 00:11:54.854
The knit cap was in her bag

219
00:11:55.854 --> 00:11:59.854
and she knew his habit of using an eye mask,

220
00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:02.154
so there was no problem.

221
00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:06.154
But what if the stewardess noticed

222
00:12:06.354 --> 00:12:09.054
Miss Tachikawa wasn't next to her the first time.

223
00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:12.254
All she had to do was create a camouflage,

224
00:12:12.254 --> 00:12:14.654
drape a blanket over her bag.

225
00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:16.654
I believe she cut the negative into small pieces

226
00:12:16.654 --> 00:12:18.254
with the scissors in the sewing kit

227
00:12:18.254 --> 00:12:20.754
and flushed them down the toilet bowl.

228
00:12:20.754 --> 00:12:23.054
The killer wanted us to think the murder was linked to the negative.

229
00:12:23.054 --> 00:12:26.054
Drawing attention away from her.

230
00:12:27.054 --> 00:12:30.254
I found a piece of the negative she cut on the seat next to Mr. Washinuma,

231
00:12:30.254 --> 00:12:34.154
it was stuck to her clothes and fell there when she sat down.

232
00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:35.554
-Check it out! -Yes, sir!

233
00:12:36.554 --> 00:12:40.154
This is how it went.

234
00:12:40.154 --> 00:12:42.054
She waited for Miss Tachikawa to fall asleep

235
00:12:42.054 --> 00:12:43.754
and told Mr. Ohtaka she had to talk to him

236
00:12:43.754 --> 00:12:45.354
and told him to wait in the toilet.

237
00:12:46.354 --> 00:12:48.654
Then she got the bottle containing the anesthetic soaked handkerchief

238
00:12:48.654 --> 00:12:51.654
and weapon and headed for the toilet.

239
00:12:52.854 --> 00:12:54.754
As soon as he opened the door.

240
00:12:54.754 --> 00:12:57.354
She pressed the handkerchief over his mouth knocking him unconscious,

241
00:12:57.354 --> 00:13:00.354
then stabbed him in the cervical cord.

242
00:13:00.354 --> 00:13:01.954
After that, she cut the negative up,

243
00:13:01.954 --> 00:13:05.254
flushed it down the toilet bowl and locked the door from the outside.

244
00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:09.554
Using this trick... When she returned from the toilet,

245
00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:13.554
it would appear Ohtaka was still alive, alibi was perfect.

246
00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:20.254
But what if someone going to the toilet saw her leaving the scene.

247
00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:25.254
I'm sure that while committing the crime, she left the door unlocked.

248
00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:30.954
That way, even if someone tried to get in,

249
00:13:30.954 --> 00:13:32.454
it's so narrow in there,

250
00:13:32.454 --> 00:13:35.454
it wouldn't open up if someone held it closed from inside.

251
00:13:35.454 --> 00:13:37.054
And realizing someone was inside,

252
00:13:37.054 --> 00:13:39.354
the person outside would go to another toilet.

253
00:13:39.354 --> 00:13:41.054
That's enough!

254
00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:42.954
After all these accusations, I'm sure you have proof, don't you?

255
00:13:42.954 --> 00:13:44.854
Proof that Tsugumi did it!

256
00:13:46.154 --> 00:13:49.554
I have the murder weapon and the proof

257
00:13:49.554 --> 00:13:52.854
I'm sure she still has it on her!

258
00:13:55.854 --> 00:14:00.354
What are you saying? She's had two body checks!

259
00:14:00.354 --> 00:14:03.954
Because it's something we would never suspect.

260
00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:07.354
It'll even pass the metal detector at the airport.

261
00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:10.354
Something only women use.

262
00:14:10.354 --> 00:14:12.254
Something only we use?

263
00:14:12.254 --> 00:14:15.854
Ridiculous. Nothing as convenient as that could possibly exist!

264
00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:20.154
Tsugumi, you didn't...

265
00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:25.654
Miss Amano, it's the linger you're wearing.

266
00:14:25.654 --> 00:14:27.854
It's the wire under your right breast.

267
00:14:28.854 --> 00:14:32.454
A woman couldn't possibly kill anyone with something like that.

268
00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:36.454
If you sharpen the end and stick it into the back of the head.

269
00:14:36.654 --> 00:14:38.254
Putting all your strength into it

270
00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:41.554
and push it 5 to 6 centimeters into the cervical vertebrae.

271
00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:44.154
The tip will reach the cervical cord,

272
00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:46.854
even a woman could do it.

273
00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:49.354
Along with the fatal injury on Mr Ohtaka's neck.

274
00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:51.654
There were many scratch marks.

275
00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:56.254
That's where the unsharpened end moved and scratched him.

276
00:14:57.254 --> 00:15:01.054
The reason Miss Amano didn't get rid of the wire is,

277
00:15:01.054 --> 00:15:03.554
if it was found at the scene,

278
00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:08.454
we would suspect the woman with wire in only one side of her bra.

279
00:15:08.454 --> 00:15:10.654
That's why...

280
00:15:13.154 --> 00:15:14.554
I understand!

281
00:15:14.554 --> 00:15:17.954
We'll just have her go through another body check.

282
00:15:17.954 --> 00:15:20.954
No, Mr. Washinuma. It's no use.

283
00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:26.154
If they search me again, they'll find it.

284
00:15:26.154 --> 00:15:27.854
Tsugumi.

285
00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:30.754
It's true. I killed Kazuhiro.

286
00:15:32.054 --> 00:15:36.654
Three years ago, he won the Nichiuri Newspaper's news photo contest.

287
00:15:36.654 --> 00:15:39.154
It was that photo's fault.

288
00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:40.454
What are you saying?

289
00:15:40.454 --> 00:15:44.154
That photo's the one that brought you two together, isn't it?

290
00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:45.254
That's right.

291
00:15:45.254 --> 00:15:49.854
I became interested in him because of that photo.

292
00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:52.554
I was so impressed that anyone could have captured the ferocity,

293
00:15:52.554 --> 00:15:55.554
the tragedy, the grief of that fire which took my brother's life,

294
00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:58.754
all that emotion in a photo.

295
00:15:58.754 --> 00:16:01.754
So why, then?

296
00:16:01.754 --> 00:16:06.654
That photo wasn't the only one he took that day.

297
00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:10.254
I found a mountain of them in his room!

298
00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:13.854
Some showed smoke rising from the condominium my brother lived in.

299
00:16:13.854 --> 00:16:18.554
And there were so many shots of the condominium before the fire!

300
00:16:18.554 --> 00:16:21.554
You mean, Kazuhiro...

301
00:16:21.554 --> 00:16:23.054
He set the fire himself.

302
00:16:23.054 --> 00:16:24.254
That's right!

303
00:16:24.254 --> 00:16:26.954
When I asked him, he practically boasted about it!

304
00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:29.854
You can't just wait around for a great shot to come along.

305
00:16:29.854 --> 00:16:32.254
You have to make it happen.

306
00:16:32.254 --> 00:16:33.554
That's what he said.

307
00:16:41.054 --> 00:16:44.154
I'm so upset.

308
00:16:44.154 --> 00:16:48.754
I was so sure no one would figure out where I hid the murder weapon.

309
00:16:48.754 --> 00:16:51.754
It's the arm you raised.

310
00:16:51.754 --> 00:16:54.354
When you were about to lower his bag from the cabinet,

311
00:16:54.354 --> 00:16:57.254
you raised your left arm and then stopped

312
00:16:57.254 --> 00:16:59.254
but then raised your right arm to take it out.

313
00:16:59.254 --> 00:17:01.954
That's what gave you away.

314
00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:04.754
The sharpened end of the wire must have shifted

315
00:17:04.754 --> 00:17:08.654
and poked into you making you stop, isn't that right?

316
00:17:09.954 --> 00:17:13.154
You mean, a detail that small made you suspect me?

317
00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:16.554
The smallest most likely to be overlooked detail

318
00:17:16.554 --> 00:17:18.854
usually turns out to be the most important.

319
00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:21.554
Your seemingly casual action,

320
00:17:21.554 --> 00:17:25.554
in my eyes, appeared unnatural and thus stuck with me.

321
00:17:31.154 --> 00:17:34.354
Her arm? Did you notice it, inspector?

322
00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.054
No, not at all.

323
00:17:42.954 --> 00:17:45.554
By the way, inspector. Why are you going to LA?

324
00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:50.554
To pick up a Japanese national on the International wanted list.

325
00:17:50.554 --> 00:17:53.754
I see. So that's what it was about.

326
00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:56.954
That's why you asked me about it.

327
00:19:27.754 --> 00:19:31.754
But you said, "Show me your bra".

328
00:19:31.954 --> 00:19:34.454
"There's wire in it, isn't there?"

329
00:19:34.454 --> 00:19:37.254
Is that how you're supposed to ask?

330
00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:40.954
That is considered to be sexual harassment, Shinichi.

331
00:19:40.954 --> 00:19:45.254
Oh, no. Don't tell me that Ran's dreaming about that case?

332
00:19:45.254 --> 00:19:48.154
Hey! What are you talking about?

333
00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:51.854
Did that creep do something to you?

334
00:19:51.854 --> 00:19:54.354
I wonder what she's dreaming about?

335
00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:57.054
I dreamt about stuffing myself with eel on rice.

336
00:19:57.854 --> 00:20:01.454
Sir, we will be in the landing position soon,

337
00:20:01.454 --> 00:20:03.354
please return to your seat.

338
00:20:05.154 --> 00:20:06.254
You idiot!

339
00:20:06.254 --> 00:20:09.254
How can you expect me to remain calm when my daughter is suffering?

340
00:20:09.254 --> 00:20:10.554
But, sir...

341
00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:12.854
Hey, what does sexual harassment mean?

342
00:20:12.854 --> 00:20:14.854
How should I know?
